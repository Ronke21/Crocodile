<text>Oracle Solaris is a proprietary Unix operating system offered by Oracle for SPARC and x86-64 based workstations and servers. Originally developed by Sun Microsystems as Solaris, it superseded the company&#x27;s earlier SunOS in 1993 and became known for its scalability, especially on SPARC systems, and for originating many innovative features such as DTrace, ZFS and Time Slider. After the Sun acquisition by Oracle in 2010, it was renamed Oracle Solaris.

Solaris was registered as compliant with the Single UNIX Specification until 29 April 2019. Historically, Solaris was developed as proprietary software. In June 2005, Sun Microsystems released most of the codebase under the CDDL license, and founded the OpenSolaris open-source project. Sun aimed to build a developer and user community with OpenSolaris; after the Oracle acquisition in 2010, the OpenSolaris distribution was discontinued and later discontinued providing public updates to the source code of the Solaris kernel, effectively turning Solaris version 11 back into a closed source proprietary operating system. Following that, OpenSolaris was forked as Illumos and is alive through several Illumos distributions. In September 2017, Oracle laid off most of the Solaris teams.

==History==
In 1987, AT&amp;T Corporation and Sun announced that they were collaborating on a project to merge the most popular Unix variants on the market at that time: Berkeley Software Distribution, UNIX System V, and Xenix. This became Unix System V Release 4 (SVR4).

On September 4, 1991, Sun announced that it would replace its existing BSD-derived Unix, SunOS 4, with one based on SVR4. This was identified internally as &quot;SunOS 5&quot;, but a new marketing name was introduced at the same time: &quot;Solaris 2&quot;. The justification for this new overbrand was that it encompassed not only SunOS, but also the OpenWindows graphical user interface and Open Network Computing (ONC) functionality.

Although SunOS 4.1.&quot;x&quot; micro releases were retroactively named &quot;Solaris 1&quot; by Sun, the Solaris name is used almost exclusively to refer only to the releases based on SVR4-derived SunOS 5.0 and later.For releases based on SunOS 5, the SunOS minor version is included in the Solaris release number. For example, Solaris 2.4 incorporates SunOS 5.4. After Solaris 2.6, the &quot;2.&quot; was dropped from the release name, so Solaris 7 incorporates SunOS 5.7, and the latest release SunOS 5.11 forms the core of Solaris 11.4.Although SunSoft stated in its initial Solaris 2 press release their intent to eventually support both SPARC and x86 systems, the first two Solaris 2 releases, 2.0 and 2.1, were SPARC-only. An x86 version of Solaris 2.1 was released in June 1993, about 6 months after the SPARC version, as a desktop and uniprocessor workgroup server operating system. It included the Wabi emulator to support Windows applications. At the time, Sun also offered the Interactive Unix system that it had acquired from Interactive Systems Corporation. In 1994, Sun released Solaris 2.4, supporting both SPARC and x86 systems from a unified source code base.

In 2011, the Solaris 11 kernel source code leaked.

On September 2, 2017, Simon Phipps, a former Sun Microsystems employee not hired by Oracle in the acquisition, reported on Twitter that Oracle had laid off the Solaris core development staff, which many interpreted as sign that Oracle no longer intended to support future development of the platform. While Oracle did have a large layoff of Solaris development engineering staff, development continued and Solaris 11.4 was released in 2018.

==Supported architectures==
Solaris uses a common code base for the platforms it supports: 64-bit SPARC and x86-64.

Solaris has a reputation for being well-suited to symmetric multiprocessing, supporting a large number of CPUs. It has historically been tightly integrated with Sun&#x27;s SPARC hardware (including support for 64-bit SPARC applications since Solaris 7), with which it is marketed as a combined package. This has led to more reliable systems, but at a cost premium compared to commodity PC hardware. However, it has supported x86 systems since Solaris 2.1 and 64-bit x86 applications since Solaris 10, allowing Sun to capitalize on the availability of commodity 64-bit CPUs based on the x86-64 architecture. Sun heavily marketed Solaris for use with both its own x86-64-based Sun Java Workstation and the x86-64 models of the Sun Ultra series workstations, and servers based on AMD Opteron and Intel Xeon processors, as well as x86 systems manufactured by companies such as Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM. , the following vendors support Solaris for their x86 server systems:
* Dell – will &quot;test, certify, and optimize Solaris and OpenSolaris on its rack and blade servers and offer them as one of several choices in the overall Dell software menu&quot;
* Intel
* Hewlett Packard Enterprise – distributes and provides software technical support for Solaris on BL, DL, and SL platforms
* Fujitsu Siemens

===Other platforms===
Solaris 2.5.1 included support for the PowerPC platform (PowerPC Reference Platform), but the port was canceled before the Solaris 2.6 release. In January 2006, a community of developers at Blastwave began work on a PowerPC port which they named &quot;Polaris&quot;. In October 2006, an OpenSolaris community project based on the Blastwave efforts and Sun Labs&#x27; &quot;Project Pulsar&quot;, which re-integrated the relevant parts from Solaris 2.5.1 into OpenSolaris, announced its first official source code release.

A port of Solaris to the Intel Itanium architecture was announced in 1997 but never brought to market.

On November 28, 2007, IBM, Sun, and Sine Nomine Associates demonstrated a preview of OpenSolaris for System z running on an IBM System z mainframe under z/VM, called &quot;Sirius&quot; (in analogy to the Polaris project, and also due to the primary developer&#x27;s Australian nationality: HMS &quot;Sirius&quot; of 1786 was a ship of the First Fleet to Australia). On October 17, 2008, a prototype release of Sirius was made available and on November 19 the same year, IBM authorized the use of Sirius on System z Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL) processors.

Solaris also supports the Linux platform application binary interface (ABI), allowing Solaris to run native Linux binaries on x86 systems. This feature is called &quot;Solaris Containers for Linux Applications&quot; (SCLA), based on the branded zones functionality introduced in Solaris 10 8/07.

==Installation and usage options==

Solaris can be installed from various pre-packaged software groups, ranging from a minimalistic &quot;Reduced Network Support&quot; to a complete &quot;Entire Plus OEM&quot;. Installation of Solaris is not necessary for an individual to use the system. The DVD ISO image can be used to load Solaris, running in-memory, rather than initiating the installation.
Additional software, like Apache, MySQL, etc. can be installed as well in a packaged form from &quot;sunfreeware&quot; and OpenCSW. Solaris can be installed from physical media or a network for use on a desktop or server, or be used without installing on a desktop or server.

===Updates===
There are several types of updates within each major release, including the Software Packages, and the Oracle Solaris Image. 

Additional minor updates called Support Repository Updates (SRUs) and Critical Patch Update Packages (CPUs), require a support credential, thus are not freely available to the public.

==Desktop environments==
Early releases of Solaris used OpenWindows as the standard desktop environment. In Solaris 2.0 to 2.2, OpenWindows supported both NeWS and X applications, and provided backward compatibility for SunView applications from Sun&#x27;s older desktop environment. NeWS allowed applications to be built in an object-oriented way using PostScript, a common printing language released in 1982. The X Window System originated from MIT&#x27;s Project Athena in 1984 and allowed for the display of an application to be disconnected from the machine where the application was running, separated by a network connection. Sun&#x27;s original bundled SunView application suite was ported to X.

Sun later dropped support for legacy SunView applications and NeWS with OpenWindows 3.3, which shipped with Solaris 2.3, and switched to X11R5 with Display Postscript support. The graphical look and feel remained based upon OPEN LOOK. OpenWindows 3.6.2 was the last release under Solaris 8. The OPEN LOOK Window Manager (olwm) with other OPEN LOOK specific applications were dropped in Solaris 9, but support libraries were still bundled, providing long term binary backwards compatibility with existing applications. The OPEN LOOK Virtual Window Manager (olvwm) can still be downloaded for Solaris from sunfreeware and works on releases as recent as Solaris 10.

Sun and other Unix vendors created an industry alliance to standardize Unix desktops. As a member of the Common Open Software Environment (COSE) initiative, Sun helped co-develop the Common Desktop Environment (CDE). This was an initiative to create a standard Unix desktop environment. Each vendor contributed different components: Hewlett-Packard contributed the window manager, IBM provided the file manager, and Sun provided the e-mail and calendar facilities as well as drag-and-drop support (ToolTalk). This new desktop environment was based upon the Motif look and feel and the old OPEN LOOK desktop environment was considered legacy. CDE unified Unix desktops across multiple open system vendors. CDE was available as an unbundled add-on for Solaris 2.4 and 2.5, and was included in Solaris 2.6 through 10.

In 2001, Sun issued a preview release of the open-source desktop environment GNOME 1.4, based on the GTK+ toolkit, for Solaris 8. Solaris 9 8/03 introduced GNOME 2.0 as an alternative to CDE. Solaris 10 includes Sun&#x27;s Java Desktop System (JDS), which is based on GNOME and comes with a large set of applications, including StarOffice, Sun&#x27;s office suite. Sun describes JDS as a &quot;major component&quot; of Solaris 10. The Java Desktop System is not included in Solaris 11 which instead ships with a stock version of GNOME. Likewise, CDE applications are no longer included in Solaris 11, but many libraries remain for binary backwards compatibility.

The open source desktop environments KDE and Xfce, along with numerous other window managers, also compile and run on recent versions of Solaris.

Sun was investing in a new desktop environment called Project Looking Glass since 2003. The project has been inactive since late 2006.

==License==

===Traditional operating system license (1992 to 2004)===
For versions up to 2005 (Solaris 9), Solaris was licensed under a license that permitted a customer to buy licenses in bulk, and install the software on any machine up to a maximum number. The key license grant was:

In addition, the license provided a &quot;License to Develop&quot; granting rights to create derivative works, restricted copying to only a single archival copy, disclaimer of warranties, and the like. The license varied only little through 2004.

===Open source (2005 until March 2010)===
From 2005 to 2010, Sun began to release the source code for development builds of Solaris under the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL) via the OpenSolaris project. This code was based on the work being done for the post-Solaris 10 release (code-named &quot;Nevada&quot;; eventually released as Oracle Solaris 11). As the project progressed, it grew to encompass most of the necessary code to compile an entire release, with a few exceptions.

===Post-Sun closed source (March 2010 to present)===
When Sun was acquired by Oracle in 2010, the OpenSolaris project was discontinued after the board became unhappy with Oracle&#x27;s stance on the project. In March 2010, the previously freely available Solaris 10 was placed under a restrictive license that limited the use, modification and redistribution of the operating system. The license allowed the user to download the operating system free of charge, through the Oracle Technology Network, and use it for a 90-day trial period. After that trial period had expired the user would then have to purchase a support contract from Oracle to continue using the operating system.

With the release of Solaris 11 in 2011, the license terms changed again. The new license allows Solaris 10 and Solaris 11 to be downloaded free of charge from the Oracle Technology Network and used without a support contract indefinitely; however, the license only expressly permits the user to use Solaris as a development platform and expressly forbids commercial and &quot;production&quot; use. Educational use is permitted in some circumstances. From the OTN license:

When Solaris is used without a support contract it can be upgraded to each new &quot;point release&quot;; however, a support contract is required for access to patches and updates that are released monthly.

==Version history==
Notable features of Solaris include DTrace, Doors, Service Management Facility, Solaris Containers, Solaris Multiplexed I/O, Solaris Volume Manager, ZFS, and Solaris Trusted Extensions.

Updates to Solaris versions are periodically issued. In the past, these were named after the month and year of their release, such as &quot;Solaris 10 1/13&quot;; as of Solaris 11, sequential update numbers are appended to the release name with a period, such as &quot;Oracle Solaris 11.4&quot;.

In ascending order, the following versions of Solaris have been released:

 

A more comprehensive summary of some Solaris versions is also available. Solaris releases are also described in the Solaris 2 FAQ.

==Development release==
The underlying Solaris codebase has been under continuous development since work began in the late 1980s on what was eventually released as Solaris 2.0. Each version such as Solaris 10 is based on a snapshot of this development codebase, taken near the time of its release, which is then maintained as a derived project. Updates to that project are built and delivered several times a year until the next official release comes out.

The Solaris version under development by Sun since the release of Solaris 10 in 2005, was codenamed &quot;Nevada&quot;, and is derived from what is now the OpenSolaris codebase.

In 2003, an addition to the Solaris development process was initiated. Under the program name &quot;Software Express for Solaris&quot; (or just &quot;Solaris Express&quot;), a binary release based on the current development basis was made available for download on a monthly basis, allowing anyone to try out new features and test the quality and stability of the OS as it progressed to the release of the next official Solaris version. A later change to this program introduced a quarterly release model with support available, renamed &quot;Solaris Express Developer Edition&quot; (SXDE).

In 2007, Sun announced &quot;Project Indiana&quot; with several goals, including providing an open source binary distribution of the OpenSolaris project, replacing SXDE. The first release of this distribution was &quot;OpenSolaris 2008.05&quot;.
The &quot;Solaris Express Community Edition&quot; (SXCE) was intended specifically for OpenSolaris developers. It was updated every two weeks until it was discontinued in January 2010, with a recommendation that users migrate to the OpenSolaris distribution. Although the download license seen when downloading the image files indicates its use is limited to personal, educational and evaluation purposes, the license acceptance form displayed when the user actually installs from these images lists additional uses including commercial and production environments.

SXCE releases terminated with build 130 and OpenSolaris releases terminated with build 134 a few weeks later. The next release of OpenSolaris based on build 134 was due in March 2010, but it was never fully released, though the packages were made available on the package repository. Instead, Oracle renamed the binary distribution Solaris 11 Express, changed the license terms and released build 151a as 2010.11 in November 2010.

==Open source derivatives==
===Current===

* illumos – A fully open source fork of the project, started in 2010 by a community of Sun OpenSolaris engineers and Nexenta OS. OpenSolaris was not 100% open source: Some drivers and some libraries were property of other companies that Sun (now Oracle) licensed and was not able to release.
* OpenIndiana – A project under the illumos umbrella aiming &quot;... to become the de facto OpenSolaris distribution installed on production servers where security and bug fixes are required free of charge.&quot;
* SchilliX – The first LiveCD released after OpenSolaris code was opened to public.
* napp-it – A webmanaged ZFS storage appliance based on Solaris and the free forks like OmniOS with a Free and Pro edition.
* NexentaStor – Optimized for storage workloads, based on Nexenta OS.
* SmartOS – Virtualization centered derivative from MNX Solutions (previously Joyent).

===Discontinued===
* OpenSolaris – A project initiated by Sun Microsystems, discontinued after the acquisition by Oracle.
* Nexenta OS (discontinued October 31, 2012) – First distribution based on Ubuntu userland with Solaris-derived kernel.
* StormOS (discontinued September 14, 2012) – A lightweight desktop OS based on Nexenta OS and Xfce.
* MartUX – The first SPARC distribution of OpenSolaris, with an alpha prototype released by Martin Bochnig in April 2006. It was distributed as a Live CD but is later available only on DVD as it has had the Blastwave community software added. Its goal was to become a desktop operating system. The first SPARC release was a small Live CD, released as marTux_0.2 Live CD in summer of 2006, the first straight OpenSolaris distribution for SPARC (not to be confused with GNOME metacity theme). It was later re-branded as MartUX and the next releases included full SPARC installers in addition to the Live media. Much later, MartUX was re-branded as OpenSXCE when it moved to the first OpenSolaris release to support both SPARC and Intel architectures after Sun was acquired by Oracle.
* MilaX – A small Live CD/Live USB with minimal set of packages to fit a 90 MB image.
* Dyson – illumos kernel with GNU userland and packages from Debian. Project is no longer active and the website is offline.
* EON ZFS Storage – A NAS implementation targeted at embedded systems.
* Jaris OS – Live DVD and also installable. Pronounced according to the IPA but in English as Yah-Rees. This distribution has been heavily modified to fully support a version of Wine called Madoris that can install and run Windows programs at native speed. Jaris stands for &quot;Japanese Solaris&quot;. Madoris is a combination of the Japanese word for Windows &quot;mado&quot; and Solaris.
* OpenSXCE – An OpenSolaris distribution release for both 32-bit and 64-bit x86 platforms and SPARC microprocessors, initially produced from OpenSolaris source code repository, ported to the illumos source code repository to form OpenIndiana&#x27;s first SPARC distribution. Notably, the first OpenSolaris distribution with illumos source for SPARC based upon OpenIndiana, OpenSXCE finally moved to a new source code repository, based upon DilOS.

<text>GLONASS (, ; ) is a Russian satellite navigation system operating as part of a radionavigation-satellite service. It provides an alternative to Global Positioning System (GPS) and is the second navigational system in operation with global coverage and of comparable precision.

Satellite navigation devices supporting both GPS and GLONASS have more satellites available, meaning positions can be fixed more quickly and accurately, especially in built-up areas where buildings may obscure the view to some satellites. Owing to its higher orbital inclination, GLONASS supplementation of GPS systems also improves positioning in high latitudes (near the poles).

Development of GLONASS began in the Soviet Union in 1976. Beginning on 12 October 1982, numerous rocket launches added satellites to the system until the completion of the constellation in 1995. In 2001, after a decline in capacity during the late 1990s, the restoration of the system was made a government priority, and funding increased substantially. GLONASS is the most expensive program of Roscosmos, consuming a third of its budget in 2010.

By 2010, GLONASS had achieved full coverage of Russia&#x27;s territory. In October 2011, the full orbital constellation of 24 satellites was restored, enabling full global coverage. The GLONASS satellites&#x27; designs have undergone several upgrades, with the latest version, GLONASS-K2, launched in 2023.

== System description ==
GLONASS is a global navigation satellite system, providing real time position and velocity determination for military and civilian users. The satellites are located in middle circular orbit at altitude with a 64.8° inclination and an orbital period of 11 hours and 16 minutes (every 17 revolutions, done in 8 sidereal days, a satellite passes over the same location). GLONASS&#x27;s orbit makes it especially suited for usage in high latitudes (north or south), where getting a GPS signal can be problematic.

The constellation operates in three orbital planes, with eight evenly spaced satellites on each. A fully operational constellation with global coverage consists of 24 satellites, while 18 satellites are necessary for covering the territory of Russia. To get a position fix the receiver must be in the range of at least four satellites.

=== Signal ===
==== FDMA ====

GLONASS satellites transmit two types of signals: open standard-precision signal L1OF/L2OF, and obfuscated high-precision signal L1SF/L2SF.

The signals use similar DSSS encoding and binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation as in GPS signals. All GLONASS satellites transmit the same code as their standard-precision signal; however each transmits on a different frequency using a 15-channel frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) technique spanning either side from 1602.0 MHz, known as the L1 band. The center frequency is 1602 MHz + &quot;n&quot; × 0.5625 MHz, where &quot;n&quot; is a satellite&#x27;s frequency channel number (&quot;n&quot;=−6...,0...,6, previously &quot;n&quot;=0...,13). Signals are transmitted in a 38° cone, using right-hand circular polarization, at an EIRP between 25 and 27 dBW (316 to 500 watts). Note that the 24-satellite constellation is accommodated with only 15 channels by using identical frequency channels to support antipodal (opposite side of planet in orbit) satellite pairs, as these satellites are never both in view of an Earth-based user at the same time.

The L2 band signals use the same FDMA as the L1 band signals, but transmit straddling 1246 MHz with the center frequency 1246 MHz + &quot;n&quot; × 0.4375 MHz, where &quot;n&quot; spans the same range as for L1. In the original GLONASS design, only obfuscated high-precision signal was broadcast in the L2 band, but starting with GLONASS-M, an additional civil reference signal L2OF is broadcast with an identical standard-precision code to the L1OF signal.

The open standard-precision signal is generated with modulo-2 addition (XOR) of 511 kbit/s pseudo-random ranging code, 50 bit/s navigation message, and an auxiliary 100 Hz meander sequence (Manchester code), all generated using a single time/frequency oscillator. The pseudo-random code is generated with a 9-stage shift register operating with a period of 1 milliseconds.

The navigational message is modulated at 50 bits per second. The superframe of the open signal is 7500 bits long and consists of 5 frames of 30 seconds, taking 150 seconds (2.5 minutes) to transmit the continuous message. Each frame is 1500 bits long and consists of 15 strings of 100 bits (2 seconds for each string), with 85 bits (1.7 seconds) for data and check-sum bits, and 15 bits (0.3 seconds) for time mark. Strings 1-4 provide immediate data for the transmitting satellite, and are repeated every frame; the data include ephemeris, clock and frequency offsets, and satellite status. Strings 5-15 provide non-immediate data (i.e. almanac) for each satellite in the constellation, with frames I-IV each describing five satellites, and frame V describing remaining four satellites.

The ephemerides are updated every 30 minutes using data from the Ground Control segment; they use Earth Centred Earth Fixed (ECEF) Cartesian coordinates in position and velocity, and include lunisolar acceleration parameters. The almanac uses modified orbital elements (Keplerian elements) and is updated daily.

The more accurate high-precision signal is available for authorized users, such as the Russian military, yet unlike the United States P(Y) code, which is modulated by an encrypting W code, the GLONASS restricted-use codes are broadcast in the clear using only &quot;security through obscurity&quot;. The details of the high-precision signal have not been disclosed. The modulation (and therefore the tracking strategy) of the data bits on the L2SF code has recently changed from unmodulated to 250 bit/s burst at random intervals. The L1SF code is modulated by the navigation data at 50 bit/s without a Manchester meander code.

The high-precision signal is broadcast in phase quadrature with the standard-precision signal, effectively sharing the same carrier wave, but with a ten-times-higher bandwidth than the open signal. The message format of the high-precision signal remains unpublished, although attempts at reverse-engineering indicate that the superframe is composed of 72 frames, each containing 5 strings of 100 bits and taking 10 seconds to transmit, with total length of 36 000 bits or 720 seconds (12 minutes) for the whole navigational message. The additional data are seemingly allocated to critical Lunisolar acceleration parameters and clock correction terms.

===== Accuracy =====
At peak efficiency, the standard-precision signal offers horizontal positioning accuracy within 5–10 metres, vertical positioning within , a velocity vector measuring within , and timing within 200 nanoseconds, all based on measurements from four first-generation satellites simultaneously; newer satellites such as GLONASS-M improve on this.

GLONASS uses a coordinate datum named &quot;PZ-90&quot; (Earth Parameters 1990 – Parametry Zemli 1990), in which the precise location of the North Pole is given as an average of its position from 1990 to 1995. This is in contrast to the GPS&#x27;s coordinate datum, WGS 84, which uses the location of the North Pole in 1984. As of 17 September 2007, the PZ-90 datum has been updated to version PZ-90.02 which differ from WGS 84 by less than in any given direction. Since 31 December 2013, version PZ-90.11 is being broadcast, which is aligned to the International Terrestrial Reference System and Frame 2008 at epoch 2011.0 at the centimetre level, but ideally a conversion to ITRF2008 should be done.

==== CDMA ====
Since 2008, new CDMA signals are being researched for use with GLONASS.

The interface control documents for GLONASS CDMA signals was published in August 2016.

According to GLONASS developers, there will be three open and two restricted CDMA signals. The open signal L3OC is centered at 1202.025 MHz and uses BPSK(10) modulation for both data and pilot channels; the ranging code transmits at 10.23 million chips per second, modulated onto the carrier frequency using QPSK with in-phase data and quadrature pilot. The data is error-coded with 5-bit Barker code and the pilot with 10-bit Neuman-Hoffman code.

Open L1OC and restricted L1SC signals are centered at 1600.995 MHz, and open L2OC and restricted L2SC signals are centered at 1248.06 MHz, overlapping with GLONASS FDMA signals. Open signals L1OC and L2OC use time-division multiplexing to transmit pilot and data signals, with BPSK(1) modulation for data and BOC(1,1) modulation for pilot; wide-band restricted signals L1SC and L2SC use BOC (5, 2.5) modulation for both data and pilot, transmitted in quadrature phase to the open signals; this places peak signal strength away from the center frequency of narrow-band open signals.

Binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) is used by standard GPS and GLONASS signals. Binary offset carrier (BOC) is the modulation used by Galileo, modernized GPS, and BeiDou-2.

The navigational message of CDMA signals is transmitted as a sequence of text strings. The message has variable size - each pseudo-frame usually includes six strings and contains ephemerides for the current satellite (string types 10, 11, and 12 in a sequence) and part of the almanac for three satellites (three strings of type 20). To transmit the full almanac for all current 24 satellites, a superframe of 8 pseudo-frames is required. In the future, the superframe will be expanded to 10 pseudo-frames of data to cover full 30 satellites.

The message can also contain Earth&#x27;s rotation parameters, ionosphere models, long-term orbit parameters for GLONASS satellites, and COSPAS-SARSAT messages. The system time marker is transmitted with each string; UTC leap second correction is achieved by shortening or lengthening (zero-padding) the final string of the day by one second, with abnormal strings being discarded by the receiver.

The strings have a version tag to facilitate forward compatibility: future upgrades to the message format will not break older equipment, which will continue to work by ignoring new data (as long as the constellation still transmits old string types), but up-to-date equipment will be able to use additional information from newer satellites.

The navigational message of the L3OC signal is transmitted at 100 bit/s, with each string of symbols taking 3 seconds (300 bits). A pseudo-frame of 6 strings takes 18 seconds (1800 bits) to transmit. A superframe of 8 pseudo-frames is 14,400 bits long and takes 144 seconds (2 minutes 24 seconds) to transmit the full almanac.

The navigational message of the L1OC signal is transmitted at 100 bit/s. The string is 250 bits long and takes 2.5 seconds to transmit. A pseudo-frame is 1500 bits (15 seconds) long, and a superframe is 12,000 bits or 120 seconds (2 minutes).

L2OC signal does not transmit any navigational message, only the pseudo-range codes:

Glonass-K1 test satellite launched in 2011 introduced L3OC signal. Glonass-M satellites produced since 2014 (s/n 755+) will also transmit L3OC signal for testing purposes.

Enhanced Glonass-K1 and Glonass-K2 satellites, to be launched from 2023, will feature a full suite of modernized CDMA signals in the existing L1 and L2 bands, which includes L1SC, L1OC, L2SC, and L2OC, as well as the L3OC signal. Glonass-K2 series should gradually replace existing satellites starting from 2023, when Glonass-M launches will cease.

Glonass-KM satellites will be launched by 2025. Additional open signals are being studied for these satellites, based on frequencies and formats used by existing GPS, Galileo, and Beidou/COMPASS signals:

* open signal L1OCM using BOC(1,1) modulation centered at 1575.42 MHz, similar to modernized GPS signal L1C, Galileo signal E1, and Beidou/COMPASS signal B1C;
* open signal L5OCM using BPSK(10) modulation centered at 1176.45 MHz, similar to the GPS &quot;Safety of Life&quot; (L5), Galileo signal E5a, and Beidou/COMPASS signal B2a;
* open signal L3OCM using BPSK(10) modulation centered at 1207.14 MHz, similar to Galileo signal E5b and Beidou/COMPASS signal B2b.
Such an arrangement will allow easier and cheaper implementation of multi-standard GNSS receivers.

With the introduction of CDMA signals, the constellation will be expanded to 30 active satellites by 2025; this may require eventual deprecation of FDMA signals. The new satellites will be deployed into three additional planes, bringing the total to six planes from the current three—aided by System for Differential Correction and Monitoring (SDCM), which is a GNSS augmentation system based on a network of ground-based control stations and communication satellites Luch 5A and Luch 5B.

Six additional Glonass-V satellites, using Tundra orbit in three orbital planes, will be launched starting in 2025; this regional high-orbit segment will offer increased regional availability and 25% improvement in precision over Eastern Hemisphere, similar to Japanese QZSS system and Beidou-1. The new satellites will form two ground traces with inclination of 64.8°, eccentricity of 0.072, period of 23.9 hours, and ascending node longitude of 60° and 120°. Glonass-V vehicles are based on Glonass-K platform and will broadcast new CDMA signals only. Previously Molniya orbit, geosynchronous orbit, or inclined orbit were also under consideration for the regional segment.

==== Common properties of open CDMA signals====

== Satellites ==
The main contractor of the GLONASS program is Joint Stock Company Information Satellite Systems Reshetnev (ISS Reshetnev, formerly called NPO-PM). The company, located in Zheleznogorsk, is the designer of all GLONASS satellites, in cooperation with the Institute for Space Device Engineering (:ru:РНИИ КП) and the Russian Institute of Radio Navigation and Time. Serial production of the satellites is accomplished by the company Production Corporation Polyot in Omsk.

Over the three decades of development, the satellite designs have gone through numerous improvements, and can be divided into three generations: the original GLONASS (since 1982), GLONASS-M (since 2003) and GLONASS-K (since 2011). Each GLONASS satellite has a GRAU designation 11F654, and each of them also has the military &quot;Cosmos-NNNN&quot; designation.

=== First generation ===
The true first generation of GLONASS (also called Uragan) satellites were all three-axis stabilized vehicles, generally weighing and were equipped with a modest propulsion system to permit relocation within the constellation. Over time they were upgraded to Block IIa, IIb, and IIv vehicles, with each block containing evolutionary improvements.

Six Block IIa satellites were launched in 1985–1986 with improved time and frequency standards over the prototypes, and increased frequency stability. These spacecraft also demonstrated a 16-month average operational lifetime. Block IIb spacecraft, with a two-year design lifetimes, appeared in 1987, of which a total of 12 were launched, but half were lost in launch vehicle accidents. The six spacecraft that made it to orbit worked well, operating for an average of nearly 22 months.

Block IIv was the most prolific of the first generation. Used exclusively from 1988 to 2000, and continued to be included in launches through 2005, a total of 56 satellites were launched. The design life was three years, however numerous spacecraft exceeded this, with one late model lasting 68 months, nearly double.

Block II satellites were typically launched three at a time from the Baikonur Cosmodrome using Proton-K Blok-DM2 or Proton-K Briz-M boosters. The only exception was when, on two launches, an Etalon geodetic reflector satellite was substituted for a GLONASS satellite.

=== Second generation ===
The second generation of satellites, known as Glonass-M, were developed beginning in 1990 and first launched in 2003. These satellites possess a substantially increased lifetime of seven years and weigh slightly more at . They are approximately in diameter and high, with a solar array span of for an electrical power generation capability of 1600 watts at launch. The aft payload structure houses 12 primary antennas for L-band transmissions. Laser corner-cube reflectors are also carried to aid in precise orbit determination and geodetic research. On-board cesium clocks provide the local clock source. 52 Glonass-M have been produced and launched.

A total of 41 second generation satellites were launched through the end of 2013. As with the previous generation, the second generation spacecraft were launched three at a time using Proton-K Blok-DM2 or Proton-K Briz-M boosters. Some were launched alone with Soyuz-2-1b/Fregat.

In July 2015, ISS Reshetnev announced that it had completed the last GLONASS-M (No. 61) spacecraft and it was putting it in storage waiting for launch, along with eight previously built satellites.

As on 22 September 2017, GLONASS-M No.52 satellite went into operation and the orbital grouping has again increased to 24 space vehicles.

=== Third generation ===
GLONASS-K is a substantial improvement of the previous generation: it is the first unpressurised GLONASS satellite with a much reduced mass of versus the of GLONASS-M. It has an operational lifetime of 10 years, compared to the 7-year lifetime of the second generation GLONASS-M. It will transmit more navigation signals to improve the system&#x27;s accuracy — including new CDMA signals in the L3 and L5 bands, which will use modulation similar to modernized GPS, Galileo, and BeiDou. Glonass-K consist of 26 satellites having satellite index 65-98 and widely used in Russian Military space.

The new satellite&#x27;s advanced equipment—made solely from Russian components — will allow the doubling of GLONASS&#x27; accuracy. As with the previous satellites, these are 3-axis stabilized, nadir pointing with dual solar arrays. The first GLONASS-K satellite was successfully launched on 26 February 2011.

Due to their weight reduction, GLONASS-K spacecraft can be launched in pairs from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome launch site using the substantially lower cost Soyuz-2.1b boosters or in six-at-once from the Baikonur Cosmodrome using Proton-K Briz-M launch vehicles.

=== Ground control ===
The ground control segment of GLONASS is almost entirely located within former Soviet Union territory, except for several in Brazil and one in Nicaragua.

The GLONASS ground segment consists of:
* a system control centre; 
* five Telemetry, Tracking and Command centers; 
* two Laser Ranging Stations; and
* ten Monitoring and Measuring Stations.

=== Receivers ===

Companies producing GNSS receivers making use of GLONASS:
* Furuno
* JAVAD GNSS, Inc
* Septentrio
* Topcon
* C-Nav
* Magellan Navigation
* Novatel
* ComNav technology Ltd.
* Leica Geosystems
* Hemisphere GNSS 
* Trimble Inc
* u-blox
NPO Progress describes a receiver called &quot;GALS-A1&quot;, which combines GPS and GLONASS reception.

SkyWave Mobile Communications manufactures an Inmarsat-based satellite communications terminal that uses both GLONASS and GPS.

, some of the latest receivers in the Garmin eTrex line also support GLONASS (along with GPS). Garmin also produce a standalone Bluetooth receiver, the GLO for Aviation, which combines GPS, WAAS and GLONASS.

Various smartphones from 2011 onwards have integrated GLONASS capability in addition to their pre-existing GPS receivers, with the intention of reducing signal acquisition periods by allowing the device to pick up more satellites than with a single-network receiver, including devices from: 
* Xiaomi
* Sony Ericsson 
* ZTE
* Huawei 
* Samsung 
* Apple (since iPhone 4S, concurrently with GPS)
* HTC
* LG
* Motorola
* Nokia

== Status ==
=== Availability ===

, the GLONASS constellation status is:

The system requires 18 satellites for continuous navigation services covering all of Russia, and 24 satellites to provide services worldwide. The GLONASS system covers 100% of worldwide territory.

On 2 April 2014, the system experienced a technical failure that resulted in practical unavailability of the navigation signal for around 12 hours.

On 14–15 April 2014, nine GLONASS satellites experienced a technical failure due to software problems.

On 19 February 2016, three GLONASS satellites experienced a technical failure: the batteries of GLONASS-738 exploded, the batteries of GLONASS-737 were depleted, and GLONASS-736 experienced a stationkeeping failure due to human error during maneuvering. GLONASS-737 and GLONASS-736 were expected to be operational again after maintenance, and one new satellite (GLONASS-751) to replace GLONASS-738 was expected to complete commissioning in early March 2016. The full capacity of the satellite group was expected to be restored in the middle of March 2016.

After the launching of two new satellites and maintenance of two others, the full capacity of the satellite group was restored.

=== Accuracy ===
According to Russian System of Differentional Correction and Monitoring&#x27;s data, , precision of GLONASS navigation definitions (for p=0.95) for latitude and longitude were with mean number of navigation space vehicles (NSV) equals 7—8 (depending on station). In comparison, the same time precision of GPS navigation definitions were with mean number of NSV equals 6—11 (depending on station).

Some modern receivers are able to use both GLONASS and GPS satellites together, providing greatly improved coverage in urban canyons and giving a very fast time to fix due to over 50 satellites being available. In indoor, urban canyon or mountainous areas, accuracy can be greatly improved over using GPS alone. For using both navigation systems simultaneously, precision of GLONASS/GPS navigation definitions were with mean number of NSV equals 14—19 (depends on station).

In May 2009, Anatoly Perminov, then director of the Roscosmos, stated that actions were undertaken to expand GLONASS&#x27;s constellation and to improve the ground segment to increase the navigation definition of GLONASS to an accuracy of by 2011. In particular, the latest satellite design, GLONASS-K has the ability to double the system&#x27;s accuracy once introduced. The system&#x27;s ground segment is also to undergo improvements. As of early 2012, sixteen positioning ground stations are under construction in Russia and in the Antarctic at the Bellingshausen and Novolazarevskaya bases. New stations will be built around the southern hemisphere from Brazil to Indonesia. Together, these improvements are expected to bring GLONASS&#x27; accuracy to 0.6 m or better by 2020. The setup of a GLONASS receiving station in the Philippines is also now under negotiation.

<doc id="46150" wikidata="Q207316" url="?curid=46150" title="Lua (programming language)">
<text>Lua is a lightweight, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language designed mainly for embedded use in applications. Lua is cross-platform software, since the interpreter of compiled bytecode is written in ANSI C, and Lua has a relatively simple C application programming interface (API) to embed it into applications.

Lua originated in 1993 as a language for extending software applications to meet the increasing demand for customization at the time. It provided the basic facilities of most procedural programming languages, but more complicated or domain-specific features were not included; rather, it included mechanisms for extending the language, allowing programmers to implement such features. As Lua was intended to be a general embeddable extension language, the designers of Lua focused on improving its speed, portability, extensibility and ease-of-use in development.

== History ==
Lua was created in 1993 by Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo and Waldemar Celes, members of the Computer Graphics Technology Group (Tecgraf) at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil.

From 1977 until 1992, Brazil had a policy of strong trade barriers (called a market reserve) for computer hardware and software, believing that Brazil could and should produce its own hardware and software. In that climate, Tecgraf&#x27;s clients could not afford, either politically or financially, to buy customized software from abroad; under the market reserve, clients would have to go through a complex bureaucratic process to prove their needs couldn&#x27;t be met by Brazilian companies. Those reasons led Tecgraf to implement the basic tools it needed from scratch.

Lua&#x27;s predecessors were the data-description/configuration languages &quot;Simple Object Language&quot; (SOL) and &quot;data-entry language&quot; (DEL). They had been independently developed at Tecgraf in 1992–1993 to add some flexibility into two different projects (both were interactive graphical programs for engineering applications at Petrobras company). There was a lack of any flow-control structures in SOL and DEL, and Petrobras felt a growing need to add full programming power to them.

In &quot;The Evolution of Lua&quot;, the language&#x27;s authors wrote:

Lua 1.0 was designed in such a way that its object constructors, being then slightly different from the current light and flexible style, incorporated the data-description syntax of SOL (hence the name Lua: &quot;Sol&quot; meaning &quot;Sun&quot; in Portuguese, and &quot;Lua&quot; meaning &quot;Moon&quot;). Lua syntax for control structures was mostly borrowed from Modula (codice_1, codice_2, codice_3/codice_4), but also had taken influence from CLU (multiple assignments and multiple returns from function calls, as a simpler alternative to reference parameters or explicit pointers), C++ (&quot;neat idea of allowing a local variable to be declared only where we need it&quot;), SNOBOL and AWK (associative arrays). In an article published in &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot;, Lua&#x27;s creators also state that LISP and Scheme with their single, ubiquitous data-structure mechanism (the list) were a major influence on their decision to develop the table as the primary data structure of Lua.

Lua semantics have been increasingly influenced by Scheme over time, especially with the introduction of anonymous functions and full lexical scoping. Several features were added in new Lua versions.

Versions of Lua prior to version 5.0 were released under a license similar to the BSD license. From version 5.0 onwards, Lua has been licensed under the MIT License. Both are permissive free software licences and are almost identical.

== Features ==
Lua is commonly described as a &quot;multi-paradigm&quot; language, providing a small set of general features that can be extended to fit different problem types. Lua does not contain explicit support for inheritance, but allows it to be implemented with metatables. Similarly, Lua allows programmers to implement namespaces, classes and other related features using its single table implementation; first-class functions allow the employment of many techniques from functional programming and full lexical scoping allows fine-grained information hiding to enforce the principle of least privilege.

In general, Lua strives to provide simple, flexible meta-features that can be extended as needed, rather than supply a feature-set specific to one programming paradigm. As a result, the base language is light; the full reference interpreter is only about 247 kB compiled and easily adaptable to a broad range of applications.

As a dynamically typed language intended for use as an extension language or scripting language, Lua is compact enough to fit on a variety of host platforms. It supports only a small number of atomic data structures such as Boolean values, numbers (double-precision floating point and 64-bit integers by default) and strings. Typical data structures such as arrays, sets, lists and records can be represented using Lua&#x27;s single native data structure, the table, which is essentially a heterogeneous associative array.

Lua implements a small set of advanced features such as first-class functions, garbage collection, closures, proper tail calls, coercion (automatic conversion between string and number values at run time), coroutines (cooperative multitasking) and dynamic module loading.

=== Syntax ===
The classic &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program can be written as follows, with or without parentheses:

print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
The declaration of a variable, without a value.

local variable
The declaration of a variable with a value of 10.

local students = 10
A comment in Lua starts with a double-hyphen and runs to the end of the line, similar to Ada, Eiffel, Haskell, SQL and VHDL. Multi-line strings and comments are marked with double square brackets.

-- Single line comment
Multi-line comment


The factorial function is implemented in this example:

function factorial(n)
 local x = 1
 for i = 2, n do
 x = x * i
 end
 return x
end
=== Control flow ===
Lua has one type of conditional test: codice_5 with optional codice_6 and codice_7 execution control constructs.

The generic codice_8 statement requires all three keywords:

if condition then
 --statement body
end
An example of an codice_1 statement

if x ~= 10 then
 print(x)
end
The codice_6 keyword may be added with an accompanying statement block to control execution when the codice_1 condition evaluates to codice_12:

if condition then
 --statement body
else
 --statement body
end
An example of an codice_13 statement

if x == 10 then
 print(10)
else
 print(x)
end
Execution may also be controlled according to multiple conditions using the codice_7 keywords:

if condition then
 --statement body
elseif condition then
 --statement body
else -- optional
 --optional default statement body
end

An example of an codice_15 statement

if x == y then
 print(&quot;x = y&quot;)
elseif x == z then
 print(&quot;x = z&quot;)
else -- optional
 print(&quot;x does not equal any other variable&quot;)
end
Lua has four types of conditional loops: the codice_2 loop, the codice_3 loop (similar to a codice_18 loop), the numeric codice_19 loop and the generic codice_19 loop.

--condition = true

while condition do
 --statements
end

repeat
 --statements
until condition

for i = first, last, delta do --delta may be negative, allowing the for loop to count down or up
 --statements
 --example: print(i)
end
This generic codice_19 loop would iterate over the table codice_22 using the standard iterator function codice_23, until it returns codice_24:

for key, value in pairs(_G) do
 print(key, value)
end
Loops can also be nested (put inside of another loop).

local grid = {
 { 11, 12, 13 },
 { 21, 22, 23 },
 { 31, 32, 33 }

for y, row in pairs(grid) do
 for x, value in pairs(row) do
 print(x, y, value)
 end
end
=== Functions ===
Lua&#x27;s treatment of functions as first-class values is shown in the following example, where the print function&#x27;s behavior is modified:

do
 local oldprint = print
 -- Store current print function as oldprint
 function print(s)
 -- Redefine print function. The usual print function can still be used
 through oldprint. The new one has only one argument.
 oldprint(s == &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot; or s)
 end
end

Any future calls to codice_25 will now be routed through the new function, and because of Lua&#x27;s lexical scoping, the old print function will only be accessible by the new, modified print.

Lua also supports closures, as demonstrated below:

function addto(x)
 -- Return a new function that adds x to the argument
 return function(y)
 -- When we refer to the variable x, which is outside the current
 scope and whose lifetime would be shorter than that of this anonymous
 function, Lua creates a closure.
 return x + y
 end
end
fourplus = addto(4)
print(fourplus(3)) -- Prints 7

--This can also be achieved by calling the function in the following way:
print(addto(4)(3))
-- This is because we are calling the returned function from &#x27;addto(4)&#x27; with the argument &#x27;3&#x27; directly.
 This also helps to reduce data cost and up performance if being called iteratively.

A new closure for the variable codice_26 is created every time codice_27 is called, so that each new anonymous function returned will always access its own codice_26 parameter. The closure is managed by Lua&#x27;s garbage collector, just like any other object.

=== Tables ===
Tables are the most important data structures (and, by design, the only built-in composite data type) in Lua and are the foundation of all user-created types. They are associative arrays with addition of automatic numeric key and special syntax.

A table is a set of key and data pairs, where the data is referenced by key; in other words, it is a hashed heterogeneous associative array.

Tables are created using the codice_29 constructor syntax.
a_table = {} -- Creates a new, empty table
Tables are always passed by reference (see Call by sharing).

A key (index) can be any value except codice_24 and NaN, including functions.
a_table = {x = 10} -- Creates a new table, with one entry mapping &quot;x&quot; to the number 10.
print(a_table[&quot;x&quot;]) -- Prints the value associated with the string key, in this case 10.
b_table = a_table
b_table[&quot;x&quot;] = 20 -- The value in the table has been changed to 20.
print(b_table[&quot;x&quot;]) -- Prints 20.
print(a_table[&quot;x&quot;]) -- Also prints 20, because a_table and b_table both refer to the same table.
A table is often used as structure (or record) by using strings as keys. Because such use is very common, Lua features a special syntax for accessing such fields.
point = { x = 10, y = 20 } -- Create new table
print(point[&quot;x&quot;]) -- Prints 10
print(point.x) -- Has exactly the same meaning as line above. The easier-to-read dot notation is just syntactic sugar.
By using a table to store related functions, it can act as a namespace.
Point = {}

Point.new = function(x, y)
 return {x = x, y = y} -- return {[&quot;x&quot;] = x, [&quot;y&quot;] = y}
end

Point.set_x = function(point, x)
 point.x = x -- point[&quot;x&quot;] = x;
end
Tables are automatically assigned a numerical key, enabling them to be used as an array data type. The first automatic index is 1 rather than 0 as it is for many other programming languages (though an explicit index of 0 is allowed).

A numeric key codice_31 is distinct from a string key codice_32.
array = { &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; } -- Indices are assigned automatically.
print(array[2]) -- Prints &quot;b&quot;. Automatic indexing in Lua starts at 1.
print(#array) -- Prints 4. # is the length operator for tables and strings.
array[0] = &quot;z&quot; -- Zero is a legal index.
print(#array) -- Still prints 4, as Lua arrays are 1-based.
The length of a table codice_33 is defined to be any integer index codice_34 such that codice_35 is not codice_24 and codice_37 is codice_24; moreover, if codice_39 is codice_24, codice_34 can be zero. For a regular array, with non-nil values from 1 to a given codice_34, its length is exactly that codice_34, the index of its last value. If the array has &quot;holes&quot; (that is, nil values between other non-nil values), then codice_44 can be any of the indices that directly precedes a codice_24 value (that is, it may consider any such nil value as the end of the array).
ExampleTable =
 {1, 2, 3, 4},
 {5, 6, 7, 8}
print(ExampleTable[1][3]) -- Prints &quot;3&quot;
print(ExampleTable[2][4]) -- Prints &quot;8&quot;
A table can be an array of objects.
function Point(x, y) -- &quot;Point&quot; object constructor
 return { x = x, y = y } -- Creates and returns a new object (table)
end
array = { Point(10, 20), Point(30, 40), Point(50, 60) } -- Creates array of points
 -- array = { { x = 10, y = 20 }, { x = 30, y = 40 }, { x = 50, y = 60 } };
print(array[2].y) -- Prints 40
Using a hash map to emulate an array is normally slower than using an actual array; however, Lua tables are optimized for use as arrays to help avoid this issue.

=== Metatables ===
Extensible semantics is a key feature of Lua, and the metatable concept allows powerful customization of tables. The following example demonstrates an &quot;infinite&quot; table. For any codice_34, codice_47 will give the codice_34-th Fibonacci number using dynamic programming and memoization.

fibs = { 1, 1 } -- Initial values for fibs[1] and fibs[2].
setmetatable(fibs, {
 __index = function(values, n) --__index is a function predefined by Lua, 
 it is called if key &quot;n&quot; does not exist.
 values[n] = values[n - 1] + values[n - 2] -- Calculate and memoize fibs[n].
 return values[n]
 end


=== Object-oriented programming ===
Although Lua does not have a built-in concept of classes, object-oriented programming can be emulated using functions and tables. An object is formed by putting methods and fields in a table. Inheritance (both single and multiple) can be implemented with metatables, delegating nonexistent methods and fields to a parent object.

There is no such concept as &quot;class&quot; with these techniques; rather, prototypes are used, similar to Self or JavaScript. New objects are created either with a factory method (that constructs new objects from scratch) or by cloning an existing object.

Creating a basic vector object:

local Vector = {}
local VectorMeta = { __index = Vector}

function Vector.new(x, y, z) -- The constructor
 return setmetatable({x = x, y = y, z = z}, VectorMeta)
end

function Vector.magnitude(self) -- Another method
 return math.sqrt(self.x^2 + self.y^2 + self.z^2)
end

local vec = Vector.new(0, 1, 0) -- Create a vector
print(vec.magnitude(vec)) -- Call a method (output: 1)
print(vec.x) -- Access a member variable (output: 0)
Here, tells Lua to look for an element in the table if it is not present in the table. , which is equivalent to , first looks in the table for the element. The table does not have a element, but its metatable delegates to the table for the element when it&#x27;s not found in the table.

Lua provides some syntactic sugar to facilitate object orientation. To declare member functions inside a prototype table, one can use , which is equivalent to . Calling class methods also makes use of the colon: is equivalent to .

That in mind, here is a corresponding class with syntactic sugar:
local Vector = {}
Vector.__index = Vector

function Vector:new(x, y, z) -- The constructor
 -- Since the function definition uses a colon, 
 -- its first argument is &quot;self&quot; which refers
 -- to &quot;Vector&quot;
 return setmetatable({x = x, y = y, z = z}, self)
end

function Vector:magnitude() -- Another method
 -- Reference the implicit object using self
 return math.sqrt(self.x^2 + self.y^2 + self.z^2)
end

local vec = Vector:new(0, 1, 0) -- Create a vector
print(vec:magnitude()) -- Call a method (output: 1)
print(vec.x) -- Access a member variable (output: 0)
==== Inheritance ====
Lua supports using metatables to give Lua class inheritance. In this example, we allow vectors to have their values multiplied by a constant in a derived class.
local Vector = {}
Vector.__index = Vector

function Vector:new(x, y, z) -- The constructor
 -- Here, self refers to whatever class&#x27;s &quot;new&quot;
 -- method we call. In a derived class, self will
 -- be the derived class; in the Vector class, self
 -- will be Vector
 return setmetatable({x = x, y = y, z = z}, self)
end

function Vector:magnitude() -- Another method
 -- Reference the implicit object using self
 return math.sqrt(self.x^2 + self.y^2 + self.z^2)
end

-- Example of class inheritance
local VectorMult = {}
VectorMult.__index = VectorMult
setmetatable(VectorMult, Vector) -- Make VectorMult a child of Vector

function VectorMult:multiply(value) 
 self.x = self.x * value
 self.y = self.y * value
 self.z = self.z * value
 return self
end

local vec = VectorMult:new(0, 1, 0) -- Create a vector
print(vec:magnitude()) -- Call a method (output: 1)
print(vec.y) -- Access a member variable (output: 1)
vec:multiply(2) -- Multiply all components of vector by 2
print(vec.y) -- Access member again (output: 2)
Lua also supports multiple inheritance; can either be a function or a table. Operator overloading can also be done; Lua metatables can have elements such as , and so on.

== Implementation ==
Lua programs are not interpreted directly from the textual Lua file, but are compiled into bytecode, which is then run on the Lua virtual machine (VM). The compiling process is typically invisible to the user and is performed during run-time, especially when a just-in-time compilation (JIT) compiler is used, but it can be done offline to increase loading performance or reduce the memory footprint of the host environment by leaving out the compiler. Lua bytecode can also be produced and executed from within Lua, using the codice_49 function from the string library and the codice_50 functions. Lua version 5.3.4 is implemented in approximately 24,000 lines of C code.

Like most CPUs, and unlike most virtual machines (which are stack-based), the Lua VM is register-based, and therefore more closely resembles most hardware design. The register architecture both avoids excessive copying of values, and reduces the total number of instructions per function. The virtual machine of Lua 5 is one of the first register-based pure VMs to have a wide use. Parrot and Android&#x27;s Dalvik are two other well-known register-based VMs. PCScheme&#x27;s VM was also register-based.

This example is the bytecode listing of the factorial function defined above (as shown by the codice_51 5.1 compiler):

 function &lt;factorial.lua:1,7&gt; (9 instructions, 36 bytes at 0x8063c60)
 1 param, 6 slots, 0 upvalues, 6 locals, 2 constants, 0 functions
 1 [2] LOADK 1 -1 ; 1
 2 [3] LOADK 2 -2 ; 2
 3 [3] MOVE 3 0
 4 [3] LOADK 4 -1 ; 1
 5 [3] FORPREP 2 1 ; to 7
 6 [4] MUL 1 1 5
 7 [3] FORLOOP 2 -2 ; to 6
 8 [6] RETURN 1 2
 9 [7] RETURN 0 1

== C API ==
Lua is intended to be embedded into other applications, and provides a C API for this purpose. The API is divided into two parts: the Lua core and the Lua auxiliary library. The Lua API&#x27;s design eliminates the need for manual reference counting (management) in C code, unlike Python&#x27;s API. The API, like the language, is minimalist. Advanced functions are provided by the auxiliary library, which consists largely of preprocessor macros which assist with complex table operations.

The Lua C API is stack based. Lua provides functions to push and pop most simple C data types (integers, floats, etc.) to and from the stack, and functions to manipulate tables through the stack. The Lua stack is somewhat different from a traditional stack; the stack can be indexed directly, for example. Negative indices indicate offsets from the top of the stack. For example, −1 is the top (most recently pushed value), while positive indices indicate offsets from the bottom (oldest value). Marshalling data between C and Lua functions is also done using the stack. To call a Lua function, arguments are pushed onto the stack, and then the codice_52 is used to call the actual function. When writing a C function to be directly called from Lua, the arguments are read from the stack.

Here is an example of calling a Lua function from C:
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;lua.h&gt; // Lua main library (lua_*)
#include &lt;lauxlib.h&gt; // Lua auxiliary library (luaL_*)

int main(void)
 // create a Lua state
 lua_State *L = luaL_newstate();

 // load and execute a string
 if (luaL_dostring(L, &quot;function foo (x,y) return x+y end&quot;)) {
 lua_close(L);
 return -1;

 // push value of global &quot;foo&quot; (the function defined above)
 // to the stack, followed by integers 5 and 3
 lua_getglobal(L, &quot;foo&quot;);
 lua_pushinteger(L, 5);
 lua_pushinteger(L, 3);
 lua_call(L, 2, 1); // call a function with two arguments and one return value
 printf(&quot;Result: %d\n&quot;, lua_tointeger(L, -1)); // print integer value of item at stack top
 lua_pop(L, 1); // return stack to original state
 lua_close(L); // close Lua state
 return 0;


Running this example gives:

$ cc -o example example.c -llua
$ ./example
Result: 8
The C API also provides some special tables, located at various &quot;pseudo-indices&quot; in the Lua stack. At codice_53 prior to Lua 5.2 is the globals table, codice_22 from within Lua, which is the main namespace. There is also a registry located at codice_55 where C programs can store Lua values for later retrieval.

=== Modules ===
Besides standard library (core) modules it is possible to write extensions using the Lua API. Extension modules are shared objects which can be used to extend the functions of the interpreter by providing native facilities to Lua scripts. Lua scripts may load extension modules using codice_56, just like modules written in Lua itself, or with codice_57. When a C library is loaded via Lua will look for the function codice_58 and call it, which acts as any C function callable from Lua and generally returns a table filled with methods. A growing set of modules termed &quot;rocks&quot; are available through a package management system named LuaRocks, in the spirit of CPAN, RubyGems and Python eggs. Prewritten Lua bindings exist for most popular programming languages, including other scripting languages. For C++, there are a number of template-based approaches and some automatic binding generators.

== Applications ==
In video game development, Lua is widely used as a scripting language, mainly due to its perceived easiness to embed, fast execution, and short learning curve. Notable games which use Lua include &quot;Roblox&quot;, &quot;Garry&#x27;s Mod&quot;, &quot; World of Warcraft&quot;, &quot;Payday 2&quot;, &quot;Phantasy Star Online 2&quot;, &quot;Dota 2&quot;, &quot;Crysis&quot;, and many others. Some games that do not natively support Lua programming or scripting, have this function added by mods, as ComputerCraft does for &quot;Minecraft&quot;. Also, Lua is used in non-video game software, such as Adobe Lightroom, Moho, iClone, Aerospike, and some system software in FreeBSD and NetBSD, and used as a template scripting language on MediaWiki using the Scribunto extension.

In 2003, a poll conducted by GameDev.net showed Lua was the most popular scripting language for game programming. On 12 January 2012, Lua was announced as a winner of the Front Line Award 2011 from the magazine &quot;Game Developer&quot; in the category Programming Tools.

Many non-game applications also use Lua for extensibility, such as LuaTeX, an implementation of the TeX type-setting language, Redis, a key-value database, ScyllaDB, a wide-column store, Neovim, a text editor, Nginx, a web server, Wireshark, a network packet analyzer and Pure Data, a visual audio programming language (through the pdlua extension).

Through the Scribunto extension, Lua is available as a server-side scripting language in the MediaWiki software that runs Wikipedia and other wikis. Among its uses are allowing the integration of data from Wikidata into articles, and powering the .

== Derived languages ==

===Languages that compile to Lua===
* MoonScript is a dynamic, whitespace-sensitive scripting language inspired by CoffeeScript, which is compiled into Lua. This means that instead of using codice_59 and codice_60 (or codice_61 and codice_62) to delimit sections of code it uses line breaks and indentation style. A notable use of MoonScript is the video game distribution website Itch.io.
* Haxe supports compiling to some Lua targets, including Lua 5.1-5.3 and LuaJIT 2.0 and 2.1.
* Fennel, a Lisp dialect that targets Lua.
* Urn, a Lisp dialect built on Lua.
* Amulet, an ML-like functional programming language, which compiler emits Lua files.
* LunarML, Standard ML compiler that produces Lua/JavaScript

=== Dialects ===
* LuaJIT, a just-in-time compiler of Lua 5.1.
* Luau developed by Roblox Corporation, a derivative of Lua 5.1 with gradual typing, additional features and a focus on performance.
* Ravi, a JIT-enabled Lua 5.3 language with optional static typing. JIT is guided by type information.
* Shine, a fork of LuaJIT with many extensions, including a module system and a macro system.
* Glua, a modified version embedded into the game Garry&#x27;s Mod as its scripting language.
* Teal, a statically typed Lua dialect written in Lua.
In addition, the Lua users community provides some &quot;power patches&quot; on top of the reference C implementation.

<text>Garrett County () is the westernmost county of the U.S. state of Maryland completely within the Appalachian Mountains. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 28,806, making it the third-least populous county in Maryland. Its county seat is Oakland. The county was named for John Work Garrett (1820–1884), president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Created from Allegany County in 1872, it was the last county to be formed in the state. The county is part of the Western Maryland region of the state. Garrett County is bordered by four West Virginia counties and to the north the Maryland–Pennsylvania boundary known as the Mason–Dixon line. The eastern border with Allegany County was defined by the Bauer Report, submitted to Governor Lloyd Lowndes, Jr. on November 9, 1898. The Potomac River and State of West Virginia lie to the south and west.

Garrett County lies in the Allegheny Mountains, which here form the western flank of the Appalachian Mountain Range. Hoye-Crest, a summit along Backbone Mountain, is the highest point in Maryland at an elevation of .

The Eastern Continental Divide runs along portions of Backbone Mountain. The western part of the county, drained by the Youghiogheny River, is the only part of Maryland within the Mississippi River drainage basin. All other parts of the county are in the Chesapeake Bay basin.

==History==
In the early 20th century, the railroad and tourism started to decline. Coal mining and timber production continued at a much slower pace. Today, tourism has made a dramatic rebound in the county with logging and farming making up the greatest part of the economic base. Due to a cool climate and lack of any large city, Garrett County has remained a sparsely populated rural area.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.3%) is water. It is the second-largest county in Maryland by land area.

Garrett County is located entirely within the highland zone of the Appalachian Mountains known variously as the Allegheny Mountains, the Allegheny Plateau, and the Appalachian Plateau. The county&#x27;s highest elevations are located along four flat-topped ridges and range to a height of at Hoye-Crest along Backbone Mountain, the highest point in the state of Maryland. As is typical in the Allegheny region, broad flats generally lie below the ridge crests at elevations of approximately . River valleys are generally narrow and deep, with ravines typically 1,000 to below surrounding peaks.

The county contains over of parks, lakes, and publicly accessible forestland. It is drained by two river systems, the Potomac and the Youghiogheny. The Savage River, a tributary of the Potomac, drains about a third of the county. The Casselman River, a tributary of the Youghiogheny, flows north from the county&#x27;s central section into Pennsylvania. The Youghiogheny itself drains the westernmost area of the county and flows north into Pennsylvania, where it empties into the Monongahela River at McKeesport, just south of Pittsburgh.

===Geologic points of interest===

====The Glades====
The Glades&#x27; is of great scientific interest because it is an ombrotrophic system (fed solely by rainwater) with peat layers up to thick, and is one of the oldest examples of mountain peatland in the Appalachians.

On the western edge of the Savage River State Forest along Maryland Route 495 lies Bittinger, Maryland, which is named after Henry Bittinger, who first settled in the area and who was joined by other German settlers moving in and taking up the fertile farmland. On the eastern edge of Bittinger is one of the largest glades area of Garrett County. Geographically, this is an area that seems to have been affected by the last great ice sheet of North America. Two miles southeast of Bittinger, there is a large deposit of peat moss.

====Loess Dunes====
In the Casselman River valley, south of Grantsville, Maryland and beside Maryland Route 495, one can see remains of geological evidence about the last great ice sheet over North America. A series of low mounds can be seen in the fields on the west side of Maryland Route 495 that are &quot;loess&quot; (wind-blown) material. Apparently, these are the only ones still visible in the northern part of Garrett County.

The mounds were formed when a glacier lake existed in the Casselman valley, and the ice around the edges of the frozen lake melted. Wind blew fine grains of earth into the water around the edges where it sank to the bottom, and the mounds were the result of the deposit of this wind-blown material.

==Politics and government==

===Government===
The county is governed by an elected three-member Board of County Commissioners, whose members serve four-year terms and must live in the district they represent. The Board is the traditional form of county government in Maryland. It may exercise only those powers conferred by the General Assembly of Maryland, and even those powers are narrowly construed.

Garrett County is administered under a line organizational method, with the County Administrator responsible for the general administration of County Government. The administration of the county is centralized with the County Administrator responsible for overseeing the financial planning, annual budget process, personnel management, and direction and management of operations within the organization.

====County seal====
On December 15, 1977, the seal of Garrett County went into effect by virtue of Resolution #7. The seal is elliptical, with the name &quot;Garrett County&quot; inscribed above the upper fourth of the ellipse, and &quot;Maryland 1872&quot; inscribed below the lower fourth of the ellipse. The date &quot;1872&quot; depicts the year of the formation of Garrett County. The seal illustrates a large snowflake to depict winter; water to represent sailing; and oaks and conifer to represent the county&#x27;s mountains. The colors are peacock blue for the sky and water. The blue and white background is divided by kelly green.

====County flag====
The official flag for Garrett County is elliptical. The flag illustrates a large snowflake to depict winter; water to represent sailing; and oaks and conifer to represent the county&#x27;s mountains. The colors are peacock blue for the sky and water. The blue and white background is divided by kelly green.

===Politics===
Although since the Civil War Maryland has been a Democratic-leaning state, Garrett County, owing to its history of German settlement from north of the Mason–Dixon line, plus strong pre-war Unionism resulting from virtual absence of slaves, has always been strongly Republican. Since it was created in 1872, Garrett is one of forty counties across the nation (chiefly Unionist strongholds in antebellum slave states) to have never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate. Compared with neighbouring and closely allied Grant County, West Virginia, Garrett has not shown quite the same levels of Republican support – Lyndon Johnson did get within 109 votes of Barry Goldwater in 1964 – but as with Grant County, the only occasion Garrett County has not been carried by the official Republican nominee occurred in 1912 when a major split in the Republican Party allowed &quot;Bull Moose Party&quot; nominee and former President Theodore Roosevelt to claim the county. Since 1996, no Democratic presidential nominee has won even 30% of the county&#x27;s vote, and not since 2010 has Garrett County voted Democratic in any statewide election.

Garrett County has been the most conservative county in Maryland in the 21st century. Owing to its strong Republican lean, Garrett County sometimes votes against ballot measures that the rest of the state approves by large margins. In 2022, Garrett County was the only county in the state to vote against legalizing recreational cannabis via 2022 Maryland Question 4. In 2024, Garrett County was the only county in the state to vote against enshrining a right to abortion in the state constitution via 2024 Maryland Question 1.

Garrett County is represented in the U.S. House of Representatives by the 6th congressional district, which includes part of northwestern metro DC. The district is currently represented by Democrat David Trone.

===Voter registration===















===Law enforcement===
The county is policed by the Garrett County Sheriff&#x27;s Office and the Maryland State Police.

The state parks are policed by the Department of Natural Resources Police.

The county established an Office of the Fire Marshal in 2022, working in collaboration with the Maryland State Office established in 1894.

==Economy==

Garrett County produces natural gas, the only county in the state to do so. Much of the economic activity in the area centers around tourism. In the winter, the Wisp ski resort in Oakland and New Germany State Park&#x27;s cross-country skiing trail are frequent destinations, and Deep Creek Lake sees much activity in the summer. The state parks in the county are frequented year-round. During the Covid-19 Pandemic, tourism boomed as many people from Washington, DC, Baltimore, and Pittsburgh wanted to get away from the city.

<text>Omaha ( ) is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Nebraska and the county seat of Douglas County. It is located in the Midwestern United States along the Missouri River, about north of the mouth of the Platte River. The nation&#x27;s 40th-most populous city, Omaha had a population of 486,051 as of the 2020 United States census. It is the anchor of the eight-county Omaha–Council Bluffs metropolitan area, which extends into Iowa and is the 58th-largest metro area in the United States, with a population of 967,604. Furthermore, the greater Omaha–Council Bluffs–Fremont combined statistical area had 1,004,771 residents in 2020.

Omaha&#x27;s pioneer period began in 1854, when the city was founded by speculators from neighboring Council Bluffs, Iowa. The city was founded along the Missouri River, and a crossing called Lone Tree Ferry earned the city its nickname, the &quot;Gateway to the West&quot;. Omaha introduced this new West to the world in 1898, when it played host to the World&#x27;s Fair, dubbed the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. During the 19th century, Omaha&#x27;s central location in the United States spurred the city to become an important national transportation hub. Throughout the rest of the 19th century, the transportation and jobbing sectors were important in the city, along with its railroads and breweries. In the 20th century, the Omaha Stockyards, once the world&#x27;s largest, and its meatpacking plants gained international prominence.

Omaha is the home to the headquarters of four &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 companies: Berkshire Hathaway, Kiewit Corporation, Mutual of Omaha, and Union Pacific Corporation. Other companies headquartered in the city include First National Bank of Omaha, Gallup, Inc., Green Plains, Intrado, Valmont Industries, Werner Enterprises, and three of the nation&#x27;s ten largest architecture and engineering firms (DLR Group, HDR, Inc., and Leo A Daly). Notable cultural institutions include the Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, Old Market, Durham Museum, Lauritzen Gardens, and annual College World Series. Modern Omaha inventions include the Reuben sandwich; cake mix, developed by Duncan Hines; center-pivot irrigation; Raisin Bran; the first ski lift in the U.S.; the Top 40 radio format as first used in the U.S. at Omaha&#x27;s KOWH Radio; and the TV dinner.

==History==

Various Native American tribes had lived in the land that became Omaha since the 17th century, including the Omaha and Ponca, Dhegihan-Siouan language people who had originated in the lower Ohio River valley and migrated west by the early 17th century; Pawnee, Otoe, Missouri, and Ioway. The word &quot;Omaha&quot; (actually &quot;Umoⁿhoⁿ&quot; or &quot;Umaⁿhaⁿ&quot;) in the Omaha language means &quot;Upstream People&quot; or &quot;Against the Current&quot;.

In 1804 the Lewis and Clark Expedition passed the riverbanks where the city of Omaha would be built. Between July 30 and August 3, 1804, members of the expedition, including Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, met with Oto and Missouria tribal leaders at the Council Bluff at a point about north of present-day Omaha. Immediately south of that area, Americans built several fur trading outposts in succeeding years, including Fort Lisa in 1812; Fort Atkinson in 1819; Cabanné&#x27;s Trading Post, built in 1822, and Fontenelle&#x27;s Post in 1823, in what became Bellevue. There was fierce competition among fur traders until John Jacob Astor created the monopoly of the American Fur Company. The Mormons built a town called Cutler&#x27;s Park in the area in 1846. While it was temporary, the settlement provided the basis for further development.

Through 26 separate treaties with the United States federal government, Native American tribes in Nebraska gradually ceded the lands that now make up the state. The treaty and cession involving the Omaha area occurred in 1854 when the Omaha Tribe ceded most of east-central Nebraska. Logan Fontenelle, an interpreter for the Omaha and signatory to the 1854 treaty, played an essential role in those proceedings.

===Pioneer Omaha===
Before it was legal to claim land in Indian Country, William D. Brown operated the Lone Tree Ferry that brought settlers from Council Bluffs, Iowa to the area that became Omaha. Brown is generally credited as having the first vision for a city where Omaha now sits. The passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1854 was presaged by the staking out of claims around the area to become Omaha by residents from neighboring Council Bluffs. On July 4, 1854, the city was informally established at a picnic on Capital Hill, current site of Omaha Central High School. Soon after, the Omaha Claim Club was formed to provide vigilante justice for claim jumpers and others who infringed on the land of many of the city&#x27;s founding fathers. Some of this land, which now wraps around Downtown Omaha, was later used to entice Nebraska Territorial legislators to an area called Scriptown. The Territorial capitol was in Omaha, but when Nebraska became a state in 1867, the capital was relocated to Lincoln, southwest of Omaha. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled against numerous landowners whose violent actions were condemned in &quot;Baker v. Morton&quot;.

Many of Omaha&#x27;s founding figures stayed at the Douglas House or the Cozzens House Hotel. Dodge Street was important early in the city&#x27;s early commercial history; North 24th Street and South 24th Street also developed independently as business districts. Early pioneers were buried in Prospect Hill Cemetery and Cedar Hill Cemetery. Cedar Hill closed in the 1860s and its graves were moved to Prospect Hill, where pioneers were later joined by soldiers from Fort Omaha, African Americans and early European immigrants. There are several other historical cemeteries in Omaha, historical Jewish synagogues and historical Christian churches dating from the pioneer era, as well. Two sculpture parks, Pioneer Courage and Spirit of Nebraska&#x27;s Wilderness and The Transcontinental Railroad, celebrate the city&#x27;s pioneering history.

===19th century===
The economy of Omaha boomed and busted through its early years. In 1858, the &quot;Omaha Daily Republican&quot; was founded by the &quot;Omaha Printing Company (rebranded Aradius Group, 2016)&quot;, it was Nebraska&#x27;s first regional newspaper–founded before Nebraska claimed statehood. Omaha was a stopping point for settlers and prospectors heading west, either overland or by the Missouri River. The steamboat &quot;Bertrand&quot; sank north of Omaha on its way to the goldfields in 1865. Its massive collection of artifacts is on display at the nearby Desoto National Wildlife Refuge. The jobbing and wholesaling district brought new jobs, followed by the railroads and the stockyards. Groundbreaking for the First transcontinental railroad in 1863, provided an essential developmental boom for the city. In 1862, the U.S. Congress allowed the Union Pacific Railroad to begin building westward railways; in January 1866 it commenced construction out of Omaha.

The Union Stockyards, another important part of the city&#x27;s development, were founded in South Omaha in 1883. Within 20 years, Omaha had four of the five major meatpacking companies in the United States. By the 1950s, half the city&#x27;s workforce was employed in meatpacking and processing. Meatpacking, jobbing and railroads were responsible for most of the growth in the city from the late 19th century through the early decades of the 20th century.

Immigrants soon created ethnic enclaves throughout the city, including Irish in Sheelytown in South Omaha; Germans in the Near North Side, joined by the European Jews and black migrants from the South; and Little Italy and Little Bohemia in South Omaha. Beginning in the late 19th century, Omaha&#x27;s upper class lived in posh enclaves throughout the city, including the south and north Gold Coast neighborhoods, Bemis Park, Kountze Place, Field Club and throughout Midtown Omaha. They traveled the city&#x27;s sprawling park system on boulevards designed by renowned landscape architect Horace Cleveland. The Omaha Horse Railway first carried passengers throughout the city, as did the later Omaha Cable Tramway Company and several similar companies. In 1888, the Omaha and Council Bluffs Railway and Bridge Company built the Douglas Street Bridge, the first pedestrian and wagon bridge between Omaha and Council Bluffs.

Gambling, drinking and prostitution were widespread in the 19th century, first rampant in the city&#x27;s Burnt District and later in the Sporting District. Controlled by Omaha&#x27;s political boss Tom Dennison by 1890, criminal elements enjoyed support from Omaha&#x27;s &quot;perpetual&quot; mayor, &quot;Cowboy Jim&quot; Dahlman, nicknamed for his eight terms as mayor.

Calamities such as the Great Flood of 1881 did not slow down the city&#x27;s violence. In 1882, the Camp Dump Strike pitted state militia against unionized strikers, drawing national attention to Omaha&#x27;s labor troubles. The Governor of Nebraska had to call in U.S. Army troops from nearby Fort Omaha to protect strikebreakers for the Burlington Railroad, bringing along Gatling guns and a cannon for defense. When the event ended, one man was dead and several were wounded. In 1891, a mob hanged Joe Coe, an African-American porter after he was accused of raping a white girl. There were also several other riots and civil unrest events in Omaha during this period.

In 1898, Omaha&#x27;s leaders, under the guidance of Gurdon Wattles, held the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, touted as a celebration of agricultural and industrial growth throughout the Midwest. The Indian Congress, which drew more than 500 American Indians from across the country, was held simultaneously. More than 2 million visitors attended these events at Kountze Park and the Omaha Driving Park in the Kountze Place neighborhood.

===20th century===

With dramatically increasing population in the 20th century, competition and fierce labor struggles led to major civil unrest. In 1900, Omaha was the center of a national uproar over the kidnapping of Edward Cudahy, Jr., the son of a local meatpacking magnate.

The city&#x27;s labor and management clashed in bitter strikes, racial tension escalated as blacks were hired as strikebreakers, and ethnic strife broke out. A major riot by earlier immigrants in South Omaha destroyed the city&#x27;s Greek Town in 1909, completely driving out the Greek population.

The civil rights movement in Omaha has roots that extend back to 1912, when the first chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People west of the Mississippi River was founded in the city.

The Omaha Easter Sunday Tornado of 1913 destroyed much of the city&#x27;s African-American community, in addition to much of Midtown Omaha.

It was during that same year that future United States President Gerald R. Ford was born in Omaha. Today, there is a museum dedicated to his birthplace.

Six years later, in 1919, the city was caught up in the Red Summer riots when thousands of whites marched from South Omaha to the courthouse to lynch a black worker, Willy Brown, a suspect in an alleged rape of a white woman. The mob burned the Douglas County Courthouse to get the prisoner, causing more than $1 million damage. They hanged and shot Will Brown, then burned his body. Troops were called in from Fort Omaha to quell the riot, prevent more crowds gathering in South Omaha, and to protect the black community in North Omaha.

The culture of North Omaha thrived throughout the 1920s through 1950s, with several creative figures, including Tillie Olsen, Wallace Thurman, Lloyd Hunter, and Anna Mae Winburn emerging from the vibrant Near North Side.

Musicians created their own world in Omaha, and also joined national bands and groups that toured and appeared in the city.

After the tumultuous Great Depression of the 1930s, Omaha rebounded with the development of Offutt Air Force Base just south of the city. The Glenn L. Martin Company operated a factory there in the 1940s that produced 521 B-29 &quot;Superfortresses&quot;, including the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; and &quot;Bockscar&quot; used in the atomic bombing of Japan in World War II.

The construction of Interstates 80, 480 and 680, along with the North Omaha Freeway, spurred development. There was also controversy, particularly in North Omaha, where new routes bisected several neighborhoods. Creighton University hosted the DePorres Club, an early civil rights group whose use of sit-in strategies for integration of public facilities predated the national movement.

Following the development of the Glenn L. Martin Company bomber manufacturing plant in Bellevue at the beginning of World War II, the relocation of the Strategic Air Command to the Omaha suburb in 1948 provided a major economic boost to the area.

From the 1950s through the 1960s, more than 40 insurance companies were headquartered in Omaha, including Woodmen of the World and Mutual of Omaha. By the late 1960s, the city rivaled, but never surpassed, the United States insurance centers of Hartford, Connecticut, New York City and Boston.

After surpassing Chicago in meat processing by the late 1950s, Omaha suffered the loss of 10,000 jobs as both the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. The city struggled for decades to shift its economy as workers suffered. Poverty became more entrenched among families who remained in North Omaha.

In the 1960s, three major race riots along North 24th Street destroyed the Near North Side&#x27;s economic base, with recovery slow for decades. In 1969, Woodmen Tower was completed and became Omaha&#x27;s tallest building and first major skyscraper at , a sign of renewal.

Since the 1970s, Omaha has continued expanding and growing, mostly to available land to the west. West Omaha has become home to the majority of the city&#x27;s population. North and South Omaha&#x27;s populations continue to be centers of new immigrants, with economic and racial diversity. In 1975 a major tornado, along with a major blizzard, caused more than $100 million in damages in 1975 dollars.

Downtown Omaha has since been rejuvenated in numerous ways, starting with the development of Gene Leahy Mall and W. Dale Clark Library in the late 1970s. In the 1980s, Omaha&#x27;s fruit warehouses were converted into a shopping area called the Old Market.

The demolition of Jobber&#x27;s Canyon in 1989 led to the creation of the ConAgra Foods campus. Several nearby buildings, including the Nash Block, have been converted into condominiums. The stockyards were taken down; the only surviving building is the Livestock Exchange Building, which was converted to multi-use and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

A historic preservation movement in Omaha has led to a number of historic structures and districts being designated Omaha Landmarks or listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Much of the push toward preservation came after Omaha gained the notorious designation of having, in 1989, demolished the largest-ever National Register historic district in the United States, a record that still stands as of 2013. The Jobbers Canyon Historic District, along the Missouri River, was felled for a new headquarters campus for ConAgra Foods, a company which threatened to relocate if Omaha did not allow them to raze the city&#x27;s historic district. The Jobber&#x27;s Canyon warehouses had before then been allowed to deteriorate and were the scene of several fires set by the homeless population that had come to live in the abandoned buildings. At the time, there were no plans in place for revitalizing the buildings.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Omaha also saw major company headquarters leave the city, including Enron, founded in the city in 1930 and taken to Houston in 1987 by the now-notorious Kenneth Lay. First Data Corporation, a large credit-card processor, also was founded in Omaha in 1969; as of 2009, its headquarters are in Atlanta.

Inacom, founded in Omaha in 1991, was a technology company that customized computer systems for large businesses, and was on the Fortune 500 list from 1997 until 2000, when it filed for bankruptcy. Northwestern Bell, the Bell System affiliate for Northwestern states, had its headquarters in Omaha from its founding in 1896 until it moved to Denver in 1991 as US West. Level 3 Communications, a large Tier 1 network provider, was founded in Omaha in 1985 as Kiewit Diversified Group, a division of Kiewit Corporation, a Fortune 500 construction and mining company still headquartered in Omaha; Level 3 moved to Denver in 1998. World Com was founded by a merger with Omaha&#x27;s MFS Communications, started as Metropolitan Fiber Systems in 1993. MFS, backed by Kiewit Corporation CEO Walter Scott Jr. and Warren Buffett, purchased UUNET, one of the largest Internet backbones in the world, for $2 billion in 1996. The now-infamous Bernie Ebbers purchased the much larger MFS for $14.3 billion in 1997 under his World Com. He moved headquarters of the merged company from Omaha to Mississippi.

===21st century===


Around the start of the 21st century, several downtown skyscrapers and cultural institutions were built. 

The First National Bank Tower on Dodge Street was completed in 2002 and is the tallest building in Omaha and the state, surpassing the Woodmen Tower as the tallest in both at . The creation of the city&#x27;s new North Downtown included the construction of the CenturyLink Center and the Slowdown/Film Streams development at North 14th and Webster Streets. Construction of the new TD Ameritrade Park, also in the North Downtown area, began in 2009 and was completed in 2011. TD Ameritrade Park is now the home of the College World Series, an event tourists flock to each year. The Union Pacific Center and the Holland Performing Arts Center opened in 2004 and 2005, respectively.

Important retail and office developments occurred in West Omaha, such as the Village Pointe shopping center and several business parks. The site of the former Ak-Sar-Ben arena was redeveloped into a mixed-use development Aksarben Village. In January 2009, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska announced plans to build a 10 story, $98 million headquarters in the Aksarben Village which it completed in Spring 2011. Another major mixed-use development to come to Omaha was Midtown Crossing at Turner Park. Developed by Mutual of Omaha, the development includes several condominium towers and retail businesses built around Omaha&#x27;s Turner Park.

There have also been several developments along the Missouri River waterfront near downtown. The Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge was opened to foot and bicycle traffic on September 28, 2008. Started in 2003, RiverFront Place Condos first phase was completed in 2006 and the second phase was opened in 2011. The development along Omaha&#x27;s riverfront is attributed with prompting the City of Council Bluffs to move their own riverfront development time line forward.

In the summers of 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2021 the United States Olympic Team swimming trials were held in Omaha, at the Qwest/Century Link Center. These events were highlights in the city&#x27;s sports community, as well as a showcase for redevelopment in the downtown area.

In the 2020s, a number of large projects have been either completed or planned in an attempt to revitalize downtown Omaha. These include the redevelopment of the Gene Leahy Mall, a large park near Omaha&#x27;s Riverfront, and the Omaha Streetcar, a nearly $500 million system of public transit.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Situated in the Midwestern United States on the bank of the Missouri River in eastern Nebraska, much of Omaha is built in the Missouri River Valley. Other significant bodies of water in the Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area include Lake Manawa, Papillion Creek, Carter Lake, Platte River and the Glenn Cunningham Lake. The city&#x27;s land has been altered considerably with substantial land grading throughout Downtown Omaha and scattered across the city. East Omaha sits on a flood plain west of the Missouri River. The area is the location of Carter Lake, an oxbow lake. The lake was once the site of East Omaha Island and Florence Lake, which dried up in the 1920s.

The Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area consists of eight counties; five in Nebraska and three in Iowa. The metropolitan area now includes Harrison, Pottawattamie, and Mills Counties in Iowa and Washington, Douglas, Sarpy, Cass, and Saunders Counties in Nebraska. This area was formerly referred to only as the Omaha Metropolitan Statistical Area and consisted of only five counties: Pottawattamie in Iowa, and Washington, Douglas, Cass, and Sarpy in Nebraska. The Omaha-Council Bluffs combined statistical area comprises the Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan statistical area and the Fremont Micropolitan statistical area; the CSA has a population of 858,720 (2005 Census Bureau estimate). Omaha ranks as the 40th-most populous city in the United States, and is the core city of its 60th-largest metropolitan area. There are no consolidated city-counties in the area; the City of Omaha studied the possibility extensively through 2003 and concluded, &quot;The City of Omaha and Douglas County should merge into a municipal county, work to commence immediately, and that functional consolidations begin immediately in as many departments as possible, including but not limited to parks, fleet management, facilities management, local planning, purchasing and personnel.&quot;

Geographically, Omaha is considered as being in the &quot;Heartland&quot; of the United States. Important environmental impacts on the natural habitat in the area include the spread of invasive plant species, restoring prairies and bur oak savanna habitats, and managing the whitetail deer population.

Omaha is home to several hospitals, mostly along Dodge Street (US6). Being the county seat, it is also the location of the county courthouse.

===Neighborhoods===

Omaha is generally divided into six geographic areas: Downtown, Midtown, North Omaha, South Omaha, West Omaha, and East Omaha. West Omaha includes the Miracle Hills, Boys Town, Regency, and Gateway areas. The city has a wide range of historical and new neighborhoods and suburbs that reflect its socioeconomic diversity. Early neighborhood development happened in ethnic enclaves, including Little Italy, Little Bohemia, Little Mexico and Greek Town. According to U.S. Census data, five European ethnic enclaves existed in Omaha in 1880, expanding to nine in 1900.

Around the start of the 20th century. the City of Omaha annexed several surrounding communities, including Florence, Dundee and Benson. At the same time, the city annexed all of South Omaha, including the Dahlman and Burlington Road neighborhoods. From its first annexation in 1857 (of East Omaha) to its controversial annexation of Elkhorn in 2007, Omaha has continually had an eye towards growth.

Starting in the 1950s, development of highways and new housing led to the movement of the middle class to suburbs in West Omaha. Some of the movement was designated as white flight from racial unrest in the 1960s. Newer and poorer migrants lived in older housing close to downtown; those residents who were more established moved west into newer housing. Some suburbs are gated communities or have become edge cities. Recently, Omahans have made strides to revitalize the downtown and Midtown areas with the redevelopment of the Old Market, Turner Park, Gifford Park, and the designation of the Omaha Rail and Commerce Historic District.

===Climate===

Omaha, due to its latitude of 41.26˚ N and location far from moderating bodies of water or mountain ranges, displays a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfa&quot;). July averages , with average relative humidity around 70% which then leads to relatively frequent thunderstorms. Temperatures reach on 29 days and on 1.7 days annually. The January daily average is , with lows reaching on 11 days annually. The lowest temperature recorded in the city was on January 5, 1884, and the highest on July 25, 1936. Average yearly precipitation is , falling mostly in the warmer months. Snow is the most common precipitation in winter, with average seasonal snowfall being .

Based on 30-year averages obtained from NOAA&#x27;s National Climatic Data Center for the months of December, January and February, Weather Channel ranked Omaha the 5th coldest major U.S. city as of 2014.

===Crime===

Omaha&#x27;s rate of violent crimes per 100,000 residents has been lower than the average rates of three dozen United States cities of similar size. Unlike Omaha, those cities have experienced an increase in violent crime overall since 2003. Rates for property crime have decreased for both Omaha and its peer cities during the same time period. In 2006, Omaha was ranked for homicides as 46th out of the 72 cities in the United States of more than 250,000 in population.

As a major industrial city into the mid-20th century, Omaha shared in social tensions that came with rapid growth and the arrival of large numbers of immigrants and migrants. Persistent poverty resulting from racial discrimination and job losses generated different crimes in the late 20th century, with the drug trade and drug abuse becoming associated with violent crime rates, which climbed after 1986 as Los Angeles gangs made affiliates in the city.

Gambling in Omaha has been an important part of the city&#x27;s history. From its founding in the 1850s through the 1930s, the city was known as a &quot;wide-open&quot; town where gambling of all sorts was openly accepted. By the 1950s, at the same time large-scale restructuring of the railroads, the meatpacking industry and other sectors caused widespread job losses and unemployment, Omaha reportedly had more illicit gambling than any other city in the nation. From the 1930s through the 1970s, a Mafia-based criminal element controlled gambling in the city.

As most forms of gambling are currently restricted in Nebraska, gambling in Omaha is limited to keno, lotteries, and parimutuel betting. This leaves Omahans to drive across the Missouri River to Council Bluffs, Iowa, where casinos are legal and many businesses operate. Recently, the National Indian Gaming Commission approved a controversial proposal made by the Ponca tribe of Nebraska. It will allow the tribe to build a casino in Carter Lake, Iowa, which sits on the west side of the Missouri River, adjacent to Omaha, where casinos are illegal.

===People===

Native Americans were the first residents of the Omaha area. The city of Omaha was established by white settlers from neighboring Council Bluffs who arrived from the Northeastern United States a few years earlier. While much of the early population was of Yankee stock, over the next 100 years numerous ethnic groups moved to the city. In 1910, the Census Bureau reported Omaha&#x27;s population as 96.4% White and 3.6% Black. Irish immigrants in Omaha originally moved to an area in present-day North Omaha called Gophertown, as they lived in dug-out sod houses. That population was followed by Polish immigrants in the Sheelytown neighborhood, and many immigrants were recruited for jobs in South Omaha&#x27;s stockyards and meatpacking industry. The German community in Omaha was largely responsible for founding its once-thriving beer industry, including the Metz, Krug, Falstaff and Storz breweries.

Since its founding, ethnic groups in the city have clustered in enclaves in north, south and downtown Omaha. In its early days, the sometimes lawless nature of a new frontier city included crime, such as illicit gambling and riots.

In the early 20th century, Jewish immigrants set up many businesses along the North 24th Street commercial area. It suffered with the loss of industrial jobs in the 1960s and, later, the shifting of population west of the city. The commercial area is now the center of the African-American community, concentrated in North Omaha. The African American community has maintained its social and religious base, while it is experiencing an economic revitalization.

The Little Italy neighborhood grew south of downtown, as many Italian immigrants came to the city to work in the Union Pacific shops. Scandinavians first came to Omaha as Mormon settlers in the Florence neighborhood. Czechs had a strong political and cultural voice in Omaha, and were involved in a variety of trades and businesses, including banks, wholesale houses, and funeral homes. The Notre Dame Academy and Convent and Czechoslovak Museum are legacies of their residence. Today the legacy of the city&#x27;s early European immigrant populations is evident in many social and cultural institutions in Downtown and South Omaha.

Mexicans originally immigrated to Omaha to work in the rail yards. Today they account for most of South Omaha&#x27;s Hispanic population and many have taken jobs in meat processing. Other large early ethnic populations in Omaha included Danes, Poles, and Swedes.

A growing number of African immigrants have made their homes in Omaha in the last twenty years. There are approximately 8,500 Sudanese living in Omaha, including the largest population of Sudanese refugees in the United States. Most have immigrated since 1995 because of warfare in Sudan. They represent ten ethnic groups, including the Nuer, Dinka, Equatorians, Maubans and Nubians. Most Sudanese people in Omaha speak the Nuer language. Other Africans have immigrated to Omaha as well, with one-third from Nigeria, and large populations from Kenya, Togo, Cameroon and Ghana.

With the expansion of railroad and industrial jobs in meatpacking, Omaha attracted many immigrants and migrants. As the major city in Nebraska, it has historically been more racially and ethnically diverse than the rest of the state. At times rapid population change, overcrowded housing and job competition have aroused racial and ethnic tensions. Around the start of the 20th century, violence towards new immigrants in Omaha often erupted out of suspicion and fear.

In 1909, anti-Greek sentiment flared after increased Greek immigration, and worsened their tendency to become strikebreakers. The killing of a policeman of Irish descent enraged the Irish community; an angry mob violently stormed the Greek neighborhood in Omaha in what would become known as the Greek Town Riot. That mob violence forced the Greek immigrant population to flee from the city. By 1910, 53.7% of Omaha&#x27;s residents and 64.2% of South Omaha&#x27;s residents were foreign born or had at least one parent born outside of America.

Six years after the Greek Town Riot, in 1915, a mob killed Juan Gonzalez, a Mexican immigrant, near Scribner, a town in the Greater Omaha metropolitan area. The event occurred after an Omaha Police Department officer investigated a criminal operation that sold goods stolen from the nearby railroad yards. Racial profiling targeted Gonzalez as the culprit. After escaping the city, he was trapped along the Elkhorn River, where the mob, including several policemen from Omaha, shot him more than twenty times. It was discovered Gonzalez was unarmed, and he had a reliable alibi for the time of the murder. No one was ever indicted for his killing.

In the fall of 1919, following Red Summer, postwar social and economic tensions, the earlier hiring of African Americans as strikebreakers, and job uncertainty contributed to a mob from South Omaha lynching Willy Brown and the ensuing Omaha Race Riot. Trying to defend Brown, the city&#x27;s mayor, Edward Parsons Smith, was lynched also, surviving only after a quick rescue.

Like other industrial cities in the U.S., Omaha suffered severe job losses in the 1950s, more than 10,000 in all, as the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. Stockyards and packing plants were located closer to ranches, and union achievements were lost as wages declined in surviving jobs. Many workers left the area if they could get to other jobs. Poverty deepened in areas of the city whose residents depended on those jobs, specifically North and South Omaha. At the same time, with reduced revenues, the city had less financial ability to respond to longstanding problems.

Despair after the April 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. contributed to riots in North Omaha, including one at the Logan Fontenelle Housing Project. For some, the civil rights movement in Omaha, Nebraska evolved towards black nationalism, as the Black Panther Party was involved in tensions in the late 1960s. Organizations such as the Black Association for Nationalism Through Unity became popular among the city&#x27;s African-American youth. This tension culminated in the &quot;cause célèbre&quot; trial of the Rice/Poindexter Case, in which an Omaha Police Department officer was killed by a bomb while answering an emergency call.

Whites in Omaha have followed the white flight pattern, suburbanizing to West Omaha. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, gang violence and incidents between the Omaha Police and Black residents undermined relations between groups in North and South Omaha.

==Economy==

With diversification in several industries, including banking, insurance, telecommunications, architecture/construction, and transportation, Omaha&#x27;s economy has grown since the early 1990s, and six national fiber optic networks converge in Omaha.

Omaha&#x27;s most prominent businessman is Warren Buffett, nicknamed the &quot;Oracle of Omaha&quot;, who for decades has ranked as one of the richest people in the world. Four Omaha-based companies: Berkshire Hathaway, Union Pacific Railroad, Mutual of Omaha, and Kiewit Corporation, are among the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500.

Omaha is the headquarters of several other major corporations, including the Gallup Organization, Werner Enterprises, First National Bank of Omaha, Gavilon, Scoular and First Comp Insurance. Many other large national firms have major operations or operational headquarters in Omaha, including Bank of the West, First Data, Sojern, PayPal, LinkedIn, Pacific Life, MetLife and Conagra Brands. The city is also home to three of the 30 largest architecture firms in the United States, including HDR, Inc., DLR Group, Inc., and Leo A Daly.

According to the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce, the largest regional employers are:
===Tourism===
Tourist attractions in Omaha include history, sports, outdoors and cultural experiences. Its principal tourist attractions are the Henry Doorly Zoo and the College World Series. The Old Market in Downtown Omaha is another major attraction and is important to the city&#x27;s retail economy. The city has been a tourist destination for many years. Famous early visitors included British author Rudyard Kipling and General George Crook. In 1883 Omaha hosted the first official performance of the Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show for 8,000 attendees. In 1898 the city hosted more than 1 million visitors from across the United States at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, a world&#x27;s fair that lasted for more than half the year.

Research on leisure and hospitality situates Omaha in the same tier for tourists as the neighboring cities of Des Moines, Iowa; Topeka, Kansas; Kansas City, Missouri; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Denver, Colorado; and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. A recent study found investment of $1 million in cultural tourism generated approximately $83,000 in state and local taxes, and provided support for hundreds of jobs for the metropolitan area, which in turn led to additional tax revenue for government.

==Arts and culture==
Several national newspapers, including the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; and The &quot;New York Times&quot; have lauded Omaha&#x27;s historical and cultural attractions.

The city is home to the Omaha Community Playhouse, the largest community theater in the United States. The Omaha Symphony Orchestra and its modern Holland Performing Arts Center, the Opera Omaha at the Orpheum theater, the Blue Barn Theatre, American Midwest Ballet, and The Rose Theater form the backbone of Omaha&#x27;s performing arts community.

=== Music ===
Omaha&#x27;s rich history in rhythm and blues, and jazz gave rise to a number of influential bands, including Anna Mae Winburn&#x27;s Cotton Club Boys and Lloyd Hunter&#x27;s Seranaders. Rock and roll pioneer Wynonie Harris, jazz great Preston Love, drummer Buddy Miles, and Luigi Waites are among the city&#x27;s homegrown talent. Doug Ingle from the late 1960s band Iron Butterfly was born in Omaha, as was indie folk singer-songwriter Elliott Smith, though both were raised elsewhere. Musical theater star Andrew Rannells was also born in Omaha and is known amongst his fans for mentioning it in most of his interviews.

Today, the diverse culture of Omaha includes a variety of performance venues, museums, and musical heritage, including the historically significant jazz scene in North Omaha and the modern and influential &quot;Omaha Sound&quot;.

Contemporary music groups either in or originally from Omaha include Mannheim Steamroller, Bright Eyes, The Faint, Cursive, Azure Ray, Tilly and the Wall, and 311.

Omaha also has a fledgling hip hop scene. Long-time bastion Houston Alexander, a one-time graffiti artist and professional Mixed Martial Arts competitor, is a local hip-hop radio show host. Cerone Thompson, known as &quot;Scrybe&quot;, has had a number one single on college radio stations across the United States.

Other notable artists include Stylo of Mastered Trax Latino who holds a strong following in South Omaha and Mexico / Latin America.

Many ethnic and cultural bands have come from Omaha. The Omaha Black Music Hall of Fame celebrates the city&#x27;s long history of African-American music and the Strathdon Caledonia Pipe Band carries on a Scottish legacy. Internationally renowned composer Antonín Dvořák wrote his Ninth (&quot;New World&quot;) Symphony in 1893 based on his impressions of the region after visiting Omaha&#x27;s robust Czech community. In the period surrounding World War I Valentin J. Peter encouraged Germans in Omaha to celebrate their rich musical heritage, too. Frederick Metz, Gottlieb Storz and Frederick Krug were influential brewers whose beer gardens kept many German bands active.

===Landmark preservation===

Omaha is home to dozens of nationally, regionally and locally significant landmarks. The city has more than a dozen historic districts, including Fort Omaha Historic District, Gold Coast Historic District, Omaha Quartermaster Depot Historic District, Field Club Historic District, Bemis Park Historic District, and the South Omaha Main Street Historic District. Omaha is notorious for its 1989 demolition of 24 buildings in the Jobbers Canyon Historic District, which represents to date the largest loss of buildings on the National Register. The only original building surviving of that complex is the Nash Block.

Omaha has almost one hundred individual properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Bank of Florence, Holy Family Church, the Christian Specht Building and the Joslyn Castle. There are also three properties designated as National Historic Landmarks.

Locally designated landmarks, including residential, commercial, religious, educational, agricultural and socially significant locations across the city, honor Omaha&#x27;s cultural legacy and important history.

Important history organizations in the community include the Douglas County Historical Society.

Built in 1962, Omaha&#x27;s Cinerama was called Indian Hills Theater. Its demolition in 2001 by the Nebraska Methodist Health System was unpopular, with objections from local historical and cultural groups and luminaries from around the world. The Dundee Theatre is the lone surviving single-screen movie theater in Omaha and still shows films. A recent development to the Omaha film scene was the addition of Film Streams&#x27;s Ruth Sokolof Theater in North Downtown. The two-screen theater is part of the Slowdown facility. It features American independents, foreign films, documentaries, classics, themed series, and director retrospectives. In addition to the five Douglas Theatres venues in Omaha, two more are opening, including Midtown Crossing Theatres, on 32nd and Farnam Streets near the Mutual of Omaha Building.

==Sports==

Sports have been important in Omaha for more than a century, and the city plays host to three minor-league professional sports teams.

Omaha has hosted the annual June NCAA College World Series men&#x27;s baseball tournament since 1950. It has been played at the downtown Charles Schwab Field since 2011.

The Omaha Sports Commission is a quasi-governmental nonprofit organization that coordinates much of the professional and amateur athletic activity in the city, including the 2008, 2012 and 2016 US Olympic Swimming Team Trials and the building of a new stadium in North Downtown. The University of Nebraska and the Commission co-hosted the 2008 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division One Women&#x27;s Volleyball Championship in December of that year.

During its championship run in the inaugural PVF season, Omaha and the Supernovas became the league&#x27;s shining star, hosting 134,969 fans across the 15 matches held at the CHI Health Center. That includes a whopping 9,656 average mark for the 12 Supernovas’ home matches, plus the 19,094 spectators who attended the PVF Semifinals and Championship.  

The Supernovas erased any doubt that professional volleyball could happen in the United States with their 9,656 match average the No. 1 mark amongst professional volleyball teams in the world.  

Omaha broke many of its own attendance records across its historic season, starting with 11,624 fans attending the first-ever PVF match on Jan. 24 between Omaha and the Atlanta Vibe. That mark was broken a few weeks later on Sunday, Feb. 18 as 11,918 fans showed up to watch the Supernovas take on the Orlando Valkyries. The newest and most current attendance record was set on Saturday, March 16 with 12,090 spectators packing into the CHI Health Center to see the Supernovas beat the Valkyries in four sets. 

Union Omaha, a professional minor league soccer team, is a member of USL League One and began play in the 2020 season. Their home games are played at Werner Park, which it shares with the Storm Chasers. The team, nicknamed the Owls, won the league championship in 2021. Union then made a deep run to the quarterfinals of the 2022 U.S. Open Cup, defeating two Major League Soccer teams in the process. The team announced plans in 2024 to build a 7,000-seat soccer-specific stadium near Downtown Omaha.

The Creighton University Bluejays compete in a number of NCAA Division I sports as members of the Big East Conference. The Bluejays play baseball at Charles Schwab Field, soccer at Morrison Stadium, and basketball at the 18,000 seat CHI Health Center Omaha. The Jays annually rank in the top 15 in attendance each year, averaging more than 16,000 people per game. 
The Omaha Mavericks, representing the University of Nebraska Omaha (UNO), also play basketball, baseball and soccer in NCAA Division I as members of The Summit League. The UNO men&#x27;s ice hockey team plays in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference.

Ice hockey is a popular spectator sport in Omaha. The Omaha Lancers, a United States Hockey League team, play at the Ralston Arena. The Omaha Mavericks play in the on-campus Baxter Arena.

Omaha was home to an expansion team, the Nighthawks, in the United Football League from 2010 to 2011. The Omaha Beef indoor football team played at the Omaha Civic Auditorium until 2012 when they moved to the new Ralston Arena.

The Kansas City-Omaha Kings, an NBA franchise, played in both cities from 1972 to 1978, before decamping solely to Kansas City until 1985, when the team moved to its current home of Sacramento.

The Cox Classic golf tournament was part of the Web.com Tour from 1996 to 2013. The circuit returned to Omaha in 2017 with the Pinnacle Bank Championship.

==Parks and recreation==

Omaha has a thriving running community and many miles of paved running and biking trails throughout the city and surrounding communities. The Omaha Marathon involves a half-marathon and a race that takes place annually in September. Omaha also has a history of curling, including multiple junior national champions.
The city&#x27;s historic boulevards were originally designed by Horace Cleveland in 1889 to work with the parks to create a seamless flow of trees, grass and flowers throughout the city. Florence Boulevard and Fontenelle Boulevard are among the remnants of this system. Omaha boasts more than of trails for pedestrians, bicyclists and hikers. They include the American Discovery Trail, which traverses the entire United States, and the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail passes through Omaha as it travels westward from Illinois to Oregon. Trails throughout the area are included in comprehensive plans for the city of Omaha, the Omaha metropolitan area, Douglas County, and long-distance coordinated plans between the municipalities of southeast Nebraska. The city also has a park dedicated to pollinating bees and insects called &#x27;Pacific Preserve&#x27;

==Government==

Omaha has a strong mayor form of government, along with a city council elected from seven districts across the city. The mayor is Jean Stothert, who was elected in May 2013, re-elected May 10, 2017, and re-elected again May 11, 2021. The longest-serving mayor in Omaha&#x27;s history was &quot;Cowboy&quot; Jim Dahlman, who served 20 years over eight terms. He was regarded as the &quot;wettest mayor in America&quot; because of the flourishing number of bars in Omaha during his tenure. Dahlman was a close associate of political boss Tom Dennison. During Dahlman&#x27;s tenure, the city switched from its original strong-mayor form of government to a city commission government. In 1956, the city switched back.

The city clerk is Elizabeth Butler. The City of Omaha administers twelve departments, including finance, police, human rights, libraries and planning. The Omaha City Council is the legislative branch and has seven members elected from districts across the city. The council enacts local ordinances and approves the city budget. Government priorities and activities are established in a budget ordinance approved annually. The council takes official action through the passage of ordinances and resolutions. Nebraska&#x27;s constitution grants the option of home rule to cities with more than 5,000 residents, meaning they may operate under their own charters. Omaha is one of only three cities in Nebraska to use this option, out of 17 eligible. The City of Omaha is considering consolidating with Douglas County government.

Although registered Republicans outnumbered Democrats in the 2nd congressional district, which includes Omaha, Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama opened three campaign offices in the city with 15 staff members to cover the state in fall 2008. Mike Fahey, the Democratic mayor of Omaha, said he would do whatever it took to deliver the district&#x27;s electoral vote to Obama; and the Obama campaign considered the district &quot;in play&quot;. Former Nebraska U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey and then-U.S. Senator Ben Nelson campaigned in the city for Obama, and in November 2008 Obama won the district&#x27;s electoral vote. This was an historical win, as Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win an electoral vote in Nebraska since 1964, only made possible by Nebraska&#x27;s split electoral vote system.

In 2011, Nebraska lawmakers moved Offutt Air Force Base and the town of Bellevuean area with a large minority populationout of the Omaha-based 2nd district and shifted in the Republican-heavy Omaha suburbs in Sarpy County. The move is expected to dilute the city&#x27;s urban Democratic vote.

The 2nd district sent its single electoral vote for Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Biden&#x27;s victory, by more than 20,000 votes, shows Omaha&#x27;s and the 2nd district&#x27;s continuing trend toward Democratic politics in recent years.

===Transportation===



Omaha&#x27;s central role in the history of transportation across America earned it the nickname &quot;Gate City of the West&quot;. Despite President Lincoln&#x27;s decree that Council Bluffs, Iowa, be the starting point for the Union Pacific Railroad, construction began from Omaha on the eastern portion of the first transcontinental railroad. By the middle of the 20th century, nearly every major railroad served Omaha.

Today, the Omaha Rail and Commerce Historic District celebrates this connection, along with the listing of the Burlington Train Station and the Union Station on the National Register of Historic Places. First housed in the former Herndon House, the Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s corporate headquarters have been in Omaha since the company began. Their new headquarters, the Union Pacific Center, opened in Downtown Omaha in 2004.

Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service through Omaha, with the California Zephyr serving Omaha station once daily in each direction. The intercity bus terminal is at 1601 Jackson St. in downtown Omaha. The terminal also service to Jefferson Lines, Burlington Trailways, and Express Arrow. Metro Transit, previously known as Metro Area Transit, is the local bus system.

Omaha&#x27;s position as a transportation center was finalized with the 1872 opening of the Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge that linked the transcontinental railroad to the railroads terminating in Council Bluffs. In 1888, the first road bridge, the Douglas Street Bridge, opened. In the 1890s, the Illinois Central drawbridge opened as the largest bridge of its type in the world. Omaha&#x27;s Missouri River road bridges are now entering their second generation, including the Works Progress Administration-financed South Omaha Bridge, now called Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Bridge, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 2006, Omaha and Council Bluffs announced joint plans to build the Missouri River Pedestrian Bridge, which opened in 2008.

The primary mode of transportation in Omaha is by automobile, with I-80, I-480, I-680, I-29, and U.S. Route 75 (JFK Freeway and North Freeway) providing freeway service across the metropolitan area. The expressway along West Dodge Road (U.S. Route 6 and Nebraska Link 28B) and U.S. Route 275 has been upgraded to freeway standards from I-680 to Fremont. City-owned Metro Transit, formerly MAT Metro Area Transit, provides public bus service to hundreds of locations throughout the Metro.

A 2017 study by Walk Score ranked Omaha 26th most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities. Of the top 50 most walkable cities only one, Omaha, Nebraska, saw its Walk Score decline, and it only decreased 0.3 points from last year. There is an extensive trail system throughout the city for walkers, runners, bicyclists, and other pedestrian modes of transportation.

Omaha is laid out on a grid plan, with 12 blocks to the mile with a north-to-south house numbering system. Omaha is the location of a historic boulevard system designed by H.W.S. Cleveland who sought to combine the beauty of parks with the pleasure of driving cars. The historic Florence and Fontenelle Boulevards, as well as the modern Sorenson Parkway, are important elements in this system. The City of Omaha has proposed the Omaha Streetcar through the city&#x27;s urban core, with proposed extensions to Council Bluffs, Iowa, Eppley Airfield, North Omaha, West Omaha, and Bellevue, Nebraska.

Eppley Airfield, Omaha&#x27;s airport, serves the region with over 5 million passengers in 2018. United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, Frontier Airlines, and Sun Country Airlines serve the airport with direct and connecting service. As of 2018, the airport has non-stop service to 34 destinations. General aviation airports that serve the area include the Millard Municipal Airport, North Omaha Airport and the Council Bluffs Airport. Offutt Air Force Base continues to serve as a military airbase; it is at the southern edge of Bellevue, which in turn lies immediately south of Omaha.

<text>Accuracy in Media (AIM) is an American non-profit conservative news media watchdog founded in 1969 by economist Reed Irvine.

AIM supported the Vietnam War and blamed media bias for the U.S. loss in the war. During the Reagan administration, AIM criticized reporting about the El Mozote massacre in El Salvador. During the Clinton administration, AIM pushed Vince Foster conspiracy theories. During the George W. Bush administration, AIM accused the media of bias against the Iraq War, defended the Bush administration&#x27;s use of torture, and campaigned to stop the United States from signing the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). It described 2008 presidential candidate Barack Obama as &quot;the most radical candidate ever to stand at the precipice of acquiring his party&#x27;s presidential nomination. It is apparent that he is a member of an international socialist movement.&quot; It also criticized the media&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AIM, which opposes the scientific consensus on climate change, has criticized media reporting on climate change. The organization gives out the Reed Irvine Accuracy in Media Award. Past recipients include Marc Morano (who runs the climate change denial website ClimateDepot), Tucker Carlson, and Jim Hoft (founder of &quot;The Gateway Pundit&quot;).

==History==
Accuracy in Media (AIM) was founded in 1969 by Reed Irvine, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank. In order to reduce what they perceive as bias in media reporting, AIM works to &quot;investigate complaints, take proven cases to top media officials, seek corrections and mobilize public pressure to bring about remedial action.&quot;

Reed Irvine and then-executive secretary Abraham Kalish sent letters to the editors of many newspapers and magazines they identified as skewed, calling out slanted news stories. If the newspaper rejected the letter, AIM bought space and printed the letter in that newspaper. Beginning in 1975, Accuracy in Media began purchasing participating interests in major media companies, allowing Irvine to attend annual shareholder meetings. He used these opportunities to express the AIM&#x27;s concerns to the various companies&#x27; owners. Reed&#x27;s son, Don, chairs the organization. Don Irvine referred to his father as a &quot;die-hard anti-communist.&quot; In 1990, Irvine was mentioned by Walter Goodman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; for &quot;his efforts to put pressure on networks and advertisers to crack down on reporters to whom he takes exception do not mark him as an enthusiast of unfettered expression.&quot; Following Irvine&#x27;s death in 2004, an editorial in the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; said that &quot;[Irvine] was stone blind to his own prejudices, and he could be scurrilous and unfair in his attacks, but he knew something about our major media&quot; and credited Irvine in part for the rise of the popular conservative view that the American media is imbued with a liberal bias.

According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, while Irvine worked at the Federal Reserve, co-workers he would eat lunch with often &quot;complained that conservative points of view were not adequately reported in the media.&quot; In his way of changing this, Irvine formed AIM.

It is also said that Reed Irvine was urged to start the organization after the 1968 Democratic National Convention because he thought the mainstream media networks were overly sympathetic to antiwar protestors.

Membership to AIM grew significantly when Reagan was president, topping 40,000 members with a budget of $1.5 million. As the organization grew, Reed Irvine was also a shareholder in media companies. During a shareholder meeting for TBS in 1989, Irvine said at the meeting that conservative leaning organizations had a difficult time getting their views presented on TBS and this was not the case for more liberal leaning groups.

 the current president of AIM is Adam Guillette.

===Funding===
AIM&#x27;s income in 1971 was $5,000. By the early 1980s, it was $1.5 million. In 2009, AIM received $500,000 in contributions.

At least eight separate oil companies are known to have been contributors in the early 80s. Only three donors are given by name: the Allied Educational Foundation (founded and chaired by George Barasch), Shelby Cullom Davis, and billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife. Scaife gave $2.2 million to Accuracy in Media between 1977 and 1998. AIM has been funded by Exxon.

==Activism==

===War coverage===
AIM was critical of media reports about the harmful effects of Agent Orange, a military herbicide with adverse health effects for humans, in the Vietnam War. AIM blamed the U.S. media for the loss in the Vietnam War. AIM criticized the 1983 PBS documentary series &quot;Vietnam: A Television History&quot; as being pro-communist. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, one of AIM&#x27;s greatest accomplishments was the documentary, &quot;Television&#x27;s Vietnam: The Real Story&quot; in response to the PBS series.

AIM charged the alliance conducting the NATO Kosovo intervention in 1999 with distorting the situation in Kosovo and lying about the number of civilian deaths in order to justify U.S. involvement in the conflict under the Clinton administration.

AIM supported the Iraq War and accused the media of bias against the Iraq War in 2007, and alleged bias in mainstream media&#x27;s coverage of the 2012 Benghazi attack. In 2008, AIM asserted &quot;Waterboarding Is Not Torture&quot; in a sub-heading. The article said that Guantanamo Bay detainees &quot;are enjoying hotel living conditions&quot; and that torture is what &quot;left-wingers associate with anything that makes an accused terrorist uncomfortable&quot;.

===Human rights===
In 1982, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter Raymond Bonner broke the story of the El Mozote massacre in El Salvador. The report was strongly criticized by AIM and the Reagan administration, and Bonner was pressured into business reporting, later deciding to resign.

AIM was critical of journalist Helen Marmor, who in 1983 produced a documentary for NBC concerning the Russian Orthodox Church. AIM contended that &quot;it ignored the repressive religious policies of the Soviet state.&quot;

===Vince Foster conspiracy theory===
AIM received a substantial amount of funding from Richard Mellon Scaife who paid Christopher W. Ruddy to investigate allegations that President Bill Clinton was connected to the suicide of Vince Foster. AIM contended that &quot;Foster was murdered&quot;, which is contrary to three independent reports including one by Kenneth Starr. AIM faulted the media for not picking up on the conspiracy, and applied itself for Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) disclosure of Foster&#x27;s death-scene photographs. Its suit to compel disclosure was denied by the District Court of Columbia in a summary judgment, unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

AIM credited much of its reporting on the Foster case to Ruddy. Yet, his work was called a &quot;hoax&quot; and &quot;discredited&quot; by conservatives such as Ann Coulter, it was also disputed by the &quot;American Spectator&quot;, which caused Scaife to end his funding of the Arkansas Project with the publisher. As CNN explained on February 28, 1997, &quot;The [Starr] report refutes claims by conservative political organizations that Foster was the victim of a murder plot and coverup&quot;, but &quot;despite those findings, right-wing political groups have continued to allege that there was more to the death and that the president and First Lady tried to cover it up.&quot;

===United Nations===
AIM has been critical of the United Nations and its coverage by the media. In February 2005, AIM alleged that United Nations correspondents, including Ian Williams, a correspondent for &quot;The Nation&quot; had accepted money from the UN while covering it for their publications. AIM also asserted that the United Nations Correspondents Association may have violated immigration laws by employing the Williams&#x27; wife. Williams and &quot;The Nation&quot; denied wrongdoing.

AIM has campaigned against the United States signing the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). AIM writes, &quot;UNCLOS is a foot in the door for a wide-ranging international agenda... America&#x27;s survival as a sovereign nation hangs in the balance.&quot; AIM argued that signing up to UNCLOS could lead to the prohibition of spanking children.

===Climate change===
AIM rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. In 2008, AIM wrote, &quot;the theory of man-made global warming is designed to increase government control over our economy and our lives through higher taxes and energy rationing.&quot;

In November 2005, AIM columnist Cliff Kincaid criticized Fox News for broadcasting a program &quot;The Heat is On&quot;, which reported that global warming represents a serious problem (the program was broadcast with a disclaimer). Kincaid argued the piece was one-sided and stated that this &quot;scandal&quot; amounted to a &quot;hostile takeover of Fox News.&quot; In 2006, Kincaid criticized Fox for &quot;tilting to the left&quot; on the issue of climate change.

AIM criticized the media for not covering a 1995 study on climate change, which it argued cast doubt on climate change. One of the authors of the study responded to AIM, &quot;The paper... focused on a discrepancy between observations and theoretical climate model predictions—the sort of thing that climate change deniers love to take out of context and hype. The conservative organization Accuracy in Media took note of the study, citing lack of media coverage of it as some sort of evidence of media bias in coverage of climate change—something that I, to this day, find puzzling as the paper actually dealt with a relatively obscure technical detail of climate models and hardly challenged the mainstream view that human activity was leading to the warming of the globe.&quot;

=== Barack Obama ===
In 2008, AIM described Barack Obama, who was at the time a candidate in the 2008 presidential election, as &quot;the most radical candidate ever to stand at the precipice of acquiring his party&#x27;s presidential nomination. It is apparent that he is a member of an international socialist movement.&quot; AIM titled one of its reports, &quot;Is Barack Obama a Marxist Mole?&quot; In the lead-up to the 2008 election, AIM wrote, &quot;there is a pattern of people who hate America showing up at critical junctures in Obama&#x27;s life and career to influence and advise him.&quot;

=== COVID-19 Pandemic ===
In March 2020, the president of AIM, Adam Guillette, took a stance on the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, asserting that the media is exaggerating the pandemic.

=== Accuracy in Media Award ===

The organization gives out the Reed Irvine Accuracy in Media Award, which has attracted controversy for some of its recipients.

In 2010, AIM gave the Reed Irvine Accuracy in Media Award to political activist Marc Morano, who is known for running the website ClimateDepot, which rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.

In 2011, AIM gave the award to Tucker Carlson.

In 2013, AIM gave the Reed Irvine Accuracy in Media Award to Jim Hoft, who runs &quot;The Gateway Pundit&quot;, a website renowned for publishing falsehoods and hoaxes.

=== Hitler truck ===
In 2022, AIM sponsored an ad campaign against antisemitism that used a truck with a digital image of Hitler giving the Nazi salute. The image included the text: &quot;All in favor of banning Jews, raise your right hand.&quot; Several rocks were thrown at the truck. The use of the imagery was criticized by the Anti-Defamation League and the UC Berkeley chapter of Hillel International.

=== Antisemitism trucks ===
In October 2023, following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, AIM initiated a controversial campaign in which they displayed the names and images of college students who had expressed support for Palestine on trucks. This event sparked significant debate and controversy around issues of free speech, privacy, and online harassment.

On Nov. 16, 2023, such a &quot;doxxing truck&quot; sponsored by AIM, with a three-sided digital billboard, drove through Yale&#x27;s campus displaying photos and names of at least 6 Yale students, 5 of which are graduate students of color, under a banner reading &quot;Yale&#x27;s Leading Antisemites.&quot; A website address printed on the side of the truck directed to a page with AIM&#x27;s logo, which requested people petition Connecticut government officials and Yale to take action against those students. In late January 2024, AIM had a doxxing truck at CU Boulder in Colorado; one professor moved class online as a consequence.

<text>Charlton Heston (born John Charles Carter; October 4, 1923 – April 5, 2008) was an American actor. He gained stardom for his leading man roles in numerous Hollywood films including biblical epics, science-fiction films and action films. He won the Academy Award as well as nominations for three Golden Globe Awards, and three Primetime Emmy Awards. He won numerous honorary accolades including the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1978, the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1967, the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award in 1971, the Kennedy Center Honors in 1997, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2003.

Heston gained stardom for his leading roles as Moses in &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956), and as the title role of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959), the latter of which earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor. His other notable credits include &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; (1952), &quot;Secret of the Incas&quot; (1954), &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; (1958), &quot;The Big Country&quot; (1958), &quot;El Cid&quot; (1961), &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965), &quot;Khartoum&quot; (1966), &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (1968), &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1970), &quot;The Omega Man&quot; (1971), &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; (1972), &quot;Soylent Green&quot; (1973), &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1974), &quot;Airport 1975&quot; (1974), &quot;Earthquake&quot; (1974), and &quot;Crossed Swords&quot; (1978). He later acted in &quot;Mother Lode&quot; (1982), &quot;Tombstone&quot; (1993), &quot;True Lies&quot; (1994), &quot;Alaska&quot; (1996), and &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1996).

In the 1950s and early 1960s, he was one of a handful of Hollywood actors who openly denounced racism and he was also an active supporter of the civil rights movement. In 1987, Heston left the Democratic Party and became a Republican, founding a conservative political action committee and supporting Ronald Reagan. Heston was a five-term president of the National Rifle Association (NRA), from 1998 to 2003. After announcing that he had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2002, he retired from acting and the NRA presidency.

==Early life==
=== Family ===
John Charles Carter was born on October 4, 1923, in Cook County, Illinois, to Lilla (&quot;née&quot; Baines; 1899–1994) and Russell Whitford Carter (1897–1966), a sawmill operator. His autobiography states that he was born in Wilmette, Illinois, while most sources indicate that he was born in adjacent Evanston, Illinois. His birth certificate, registered when he was 11 days old, lists his name as Charlton Carter and records his birthplace as Evanston.

Heston said in a 1995 interview that he was not very good at remembering addresses or his early childhood. Heston was partially of Scottish descent, including from the Clan Fraser, but the majority of his ancestry was English. His earliest colonial ancestors arrived in America from England in the 1600s. His maternal great-grandparents and namesakes were Englishman William Charlton from Sunderland and Scotswoman Mary Drysdale Charlton. They emigrated to Canada, where his grandmother, Marian Emily Charlton, was born in 1872. In his autobiography Heston refers to his father participating in his family&#x27;s construction business. When Heston was an infant, his father&#x27;s work moved the family to St. Helen, Michigan. It was a rural, heavily forested part of the state, and Heston lived an isolated yet idyllic existence, spending much time hunting and fishing in the backwoods of the area.

When Heston was ten years old, his parents divorced after having three children. Shortly thereafter, his mother remarried and Charlton, with his younger sister Lilla and younger brother Alan, next moved to Wilmette. Heston and his two siblings took the surname of his mother&#x27;s new husband. The three children attended New Trier High School, which would become the high school also for the movie stars Rock Hudson and Ann-Margret. He recalled living there, &quot;All kids play pretend games, but I did it more than most. Even when we moved to Chicago, I was more or less a loner. We lived in a North Shore suburb, where I was a skinny hick from the woods, and all the other kids seemed to be rich and know about girls&quot;. Contradictions on paper and in an interview surround when &quot;Charlton&quot; became Heston&#x27;s first name. His birth certificate lists his name as Charlton Carter, and the 1930 United States Census record for Richfield, Michigan, in Roscommon County, shows his name as being Charlton J. Carter at age six. Later accounts and movie studio biographies say he was born John Charles Carter. When Russell Carter died in 1966, Charlton&#x27;s brother and sister changed their surname from Carter to Heston the following year; Charlton did not.

Charlton was his maternal grandmother Marian&#x27;s maiden name, not his mother Lilla&#x27;s. This is contrary to how 20th-century references read and what Heston said. When Heston&#x27;s maternal grandmother and his biological maternal grandfather Charles Baines separated or divorced in the early 1900s, Marian (&quot;née&quot; Charlton) Baines married William Henry Lawton in 1907. Charlton Heston&#x27;s mother, Lilla, and her sister May were adopted by their maternal grandfather and changed their last name to Charlton in order to distance themselves from their biological father, Mr. Baines, who was an undesirable father figure. The Carters divorced in 1933 and Lilla Carter married Chester Heston. The newly married Mrs. Heston preferred her children use the same last name as hers. It was thus as Charlton Heston that he appeared in his first film with younger brother Alan Carter (small role), an adaptation of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; (1941). His nickname was always Chuck.

=== Education ===
Heston frequently recounted that while growing up in northern Michigan in a sparsely populated area, he often wandered in the forest, &quot;acting&quot; out characters from books he had read. Later, in high school, he enrolled in New Trier&#x27;s drama program, playing the lead role in the amateur silent 16 mm film adaptation of &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, from the Ibsen play, by future film activist David Bradley released in 1941. From the Winnetka Community Theatre (or the Winnetka Dramatist&#x27;s Guild, as it was then known) in which he was active, he earned a drama scholarship to Northwestern University. He attended college from 1941 to 1943 and among his acting teachers was Alvina Krause. Several years later, Heston teamed up with Bradley to produce the first sound version of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, in which Heston played Mark Antony.

===World War II service===
In March 1944 Heston married Northwestern University student Lydia Marie Clarke at Grace Methodist Church in downtown Greensboro, North Carolina. That same year, he joined the military. Heston enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces and served for two years as a radio operator and aerial gunner aboard a B-25 Mitchell medium bomber stationed in the Alaskan Aleutian Islands with the 77th Bombardment Squadron of the Eleventh Air Force. He reached the rank of staff sergeant.

After his rise to fame, Heston narrated for highly classified U.S. Armed Forces and Department of Energy instructional films, particularly relating to nuclear weapons, and &quot;for six years Heston [held] the nation&#x27;s highest security clearance&quot; or Q clearance. The Q clearance is similar to a DoD or DIA clearance of top secret.

== Career ==
===1947–1955: Early theatre and film roles ===

After the war, the Hestons lived in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, New York City, where they worked as artists&#x27; models. Seeking a way to make it in theatre, they decided to manage a playhouse in Asheville, North Carolina, in 1947, making $100 a week. In 1948, they returned to New York, where Heston was offered a supporting role in a Broadway revival of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, starring Katharine Cornell. In television, Heston played a number of roles in CBS&#x27;s &quot;Studio One&quot;, one of the most popular anthology dramas of the 1950s. In 1949 Heston played Mark Antony in an independent film adaptation of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1950). Film producer Hal B. Wallis spotted Heston in a 1950 television production of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and offered him a contract. When his wife reminded Heston they had decided to pursue theater and television, he replied, &quot;Well, maybe just for one film to see what it&#x27;s like.&quot;

Heston&#x27;s first professional movie appearance was the leading role at age 26 in &quot;Dark City&quot;, a 1950 film noir produced by Hal Wallis. His breakthrough came when Cecil B. DeMille cast him as a circus manager in &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, which was named by the Motion Picture Academy as the Best Picture of 1952. It was also the most popular movie of that year. King Vidor used Heston in a melodrama with Jennifer Jones, &quot;Ruby Gentry&quot; (1952). He followed it with a Western at Paramount, &quot;The Savage&quot; (1952), playing a white man raised by Indians. 20th Century Fox used him to play Andrew Jackson in &quot;The President&#x27;s Lady&quot; (1953) opposite Susan Hayward. Back at Paramount he was Buffalo Bill in &quot;Pony Express&quot; (1953). He followed this with another Western, &quot;Arrowhead&quot; (1953).

In 1953, Heston was Billy Wilder&#x27;s first choice to play Sefton in &quot;Stalag 17&quot;. However, the role was given to William Holden, who won an Oscar for it. Hal Wallis reunited Heston with Lizabeth Scott in a melodrama &quot;Bad for Each Other&quot; (1953). In 1954, he made two adventure films for Paramount Pictures. &quot;The Naked Jungle&quot; had him battle a plague of killer ants. He played the lead in &quot;Secret of the Incas&quot;, which was shot on location at the archeological site Machu Picchu and has numerous similarities to &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, which appeared a quarter of a century later. Heston played William Clark, the explorer, in &quot;The Far Horizons&quot; (1955) alongside Fred MacMurray as Meriwether Lewis. He tried a comedy &quot;The Private War of Major Benson&quot; (1955) at Universal, then supported Jane Wyman in a drama &quot;Lucy Gallant&quot; (1955).
Heston became an icon for playing Moses in the hugely successful biblical epic &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956), selected by director Cecil B. DeMille, who thought Heston bore an uncanny resemblance to Michelangelo&#x27;s statue of Moses. DeMille cast Heston&#x27;s three-month-old son, Fraser Clarke Heston, as the infant Moses. &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; became one of the greatest box office successes of all time and is the eighth-highest-grossing film adjusted for inflation. His portrayal of the Hebrew prophet and deliverer was praised by film critics. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; described him as &quot;splendid, handsome and princely (and human) in the scenes dealing with him as a young man, and majestic and terrible as his role demands it&quot;. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; wrote that he &quot;is remarkably effective as both the young, princely Moses and as the Patriarchal savior of his people&quot;. His performance as Moses earned him his first nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama and Spain&#x27;s Fotogramas de Plata Award for Best Foreign Performer. When the Egyptian Theater reopened in December 1998, it screened Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s 1923 original &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;, which had premiered there 75 years earlier. Charlton and Lydia Heston were honored guests at this opening showing and were seated with their longtime friends, brothers Charles Elias Disney and Daniel H. Disney.
Heston went back to Westerns with &quot;Three Violent People&quot; (1957). Universal tried to interest him in a thriller starring Orson Welles, &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;; Heston agreed to be in it if Welles directed. The film has come to be regarded as a classic masterpiece. He also played a rare supporting role in William Wyler&#x27;s &quot;The Big Country&quot; opposite Gregory Peck and Burl Ives. Heston got another chance to play Andrew Jackson in &quot;The Buccaneer&quot; (1958), produced by De Mille and starring Yul Brynner.

===1956–1970: Film stardom ===
After Marlon Brando, Burt Lancaster, and Rock Hudson turned down the title role in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959), Heston accepted the role, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor, one of the unprecedented 11 Oscars the film earned. After Moses and &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, Heston became more identified with Biblical epics than any other actor. He later voiced Ben-Hur in an animated television production of the Lew Wallace novel in 2003. Heston followed it with &quot;The Wreck of the Mary Deare&quot; (1959) co-starring Gary Cooper, which was a box office disappointment.

Heston turned down the lead opposite Marilyn Monroe in &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Love&quot; to appear in Benn W. Levy&#x27;s play &quot;The Tumbler&quot;, directed by Laurence Olivier. Called a &quot;harrowingly pretentious verse drama&quot; by &quot;Time&quot;, the production went through a troubled out-of-town tryout period in Boston and closed after five performances on Broadway in February 1960. Heston, a great admirer of Olivier the actor, took on the play to work with him as a director. After the play flopped, Heston told columnist Joe Hyams, &quot;I feel I am the only one who came out with a profit. ... I got out of it precisely what I went in for—a chance to work with Olivier. I learned from him in six weeks things I never would have learned otherwise. I think I&#x27;ve ended up a better actor.&quot;

Heston enjoyed acting on stage, believing it revivified him as an actor. He never returned to Broadway but acted in regional theatres. His most frequent stage roles included the title role in &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and Mark Antony in both &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;. Heston considered himself to be a Shakespearean actor and collected significant works by and about William Shakespeare. He played Sir Thomas More in &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; in several regional productions in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, eventually playing it in London&#x27;s West End. The play was a success and the West End production was taken to Aberdeen, Scotland, for a week, where it was staged at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre. Samuel Bronston pursued Heston to play the title role in an epic shot in Spain, &quot;El Cid&quot; (1961), which was a big success. He was in a war film for Paramount, &quot;The Pigeon That Took Rome&quot; (1962), and a melodrama shot in Hawaii, &quot;Diamond Head&quot; (1963). Bronston wanted him for another epic and the result was &quot;55 Days at Peking&quot; (1963), which was a box office disappointment.

Heston focused on epics: he was John the Baptist in &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965); Michelangelo in &quot;The Agony and the Ecstasy&quot; (1965) opposite Rex Harrison; the title role in &quot;Major Dundee&quot; (1965), directed by Sam Peckinpah. &quot;The War Lord&quot; (1965), directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, was on a smaller scale and critically acclaimed, though commercially it fared poorly. In &quot;Khartoum&quot; (1966) Heston played General Charles Gordon. From 1965 until 1971, Heston served as president of the Screen Actors Guild. The Guild had been created in 1933 for the benefit of actors, who had different interests from the producers and directors who controlled the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He was more conservative than most actors and publicly clashed with outspoken liberal actors such as Ed Asner. &quot;Counterpoint&quot; (1968) was a war film that was not particularly successful at the box office. Neither was the Western &quot;Will Penny&quot; (1968), directed by Tom Gries; however, Heston received excellent reviews and it was one of his favorite films.

Heston had not been in a big hit for a number of years but in 1968 he starred in &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, directed by Schaffner, which was hugely popular. Less so was a football drama, &quot;Number One&quot; (1969) directed by Gries. Heston had a smaller supporting role in &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot; (1970), which was popular. However, &quot;The Hawaiians&quot; (1970), directed by Gries, was not. In 1970, he portrayed Mark Antony again in another film version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;. His co-stars included Jason Robards as Brutus, Richard Chamberlain as Octavius, Robert Vaughn as Casca, and English actors Richard Johnson as Cassius, John Gielgud as Caesar, and Diana Rigg as Portia.
===1971–1984: Established star ===
In 1971, he starred in the post-apocalyptic science-fiction film &quot;The Omega Man&quot;, which has received mixed critical reviews, but was popular, and has become a cult film in the years since release. It was also during this time he became a gun rights advocate. In 1972, Heston made his directorial debut and starred as Mark Antony in an adaptation of the William Shakespeare play he had performed earlier in his theater career, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;. Hildegarde Neil was Cleopatra and English actor Eric Porter was Ahenobarbus. After receiving scathing reviews, the film was never released to theaters and is rarely seen on television.

His next film, &quot;Skyjacked&quot; (1972) was a hit. However &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; (1972) was a flop, one of Heston&#x27;s least favorite films. He quickly recovered with a string of memorable hits: &quot;Soylent Green&quot; (1973), another dystopian science fiction film that has achieved cult status; &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1973), playing Cardinal Richelieu as part an all-star cast ensemble; two back-to-back disaster films, the hugely successful &quot;Earthquake&quot; (1974), and &quot;Airport 1975&quot; (1974), also a success; and &quot;Midway&quot; (1976) a war film.

Heston&#x27;s long run at the box office ended with &quot;Two-Minute Warning&quot; (1976), a suspense film, and &quot;The Last Hard Men&quot; (1976), a Western. He played King Henry VIII for &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; (1977), from the &quot;Musketeers&quot; team, then starred in a disaster film, &quot;Gray Lady Down&quot; (1978). Heston was in a Western written by his son, &quot;The Mountain Men&quot; (1980), and a horror film, &quot;The Awakening&quot; (1980). He made his second film as a director &quot;Mother Lode&quot; (1982) also written by his son, and it was a commercial disappointment.

===1985–2000: Later film roles ===
From 1985 until 1987, he starred in his only prime time stint on a television series in the soap, &quot;The Colbys&quot;. With his son Fraser, he produced and starred in several TV movies, including remakes of &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;. In 1992, Heston appeared on the A&amp;E cable network in a short series of videos, &quot;Charlton Heston Presents the Bible&quot;, reading passages from the King James version.

In 1993, Heston teamed up with John Anthony West and Robert M. Schoch in an Emmy Award-winning NBC special, &quot;The Mystery of the Sphinx&quot;. West and Schoch had proposed a much earlier date for the construction of the Great Sphinx than the one which is generally accepted. They had suggested that the main type of weathering evident on the Great Sphinx and surrounding enclosure walls could only have been caused by prolonged and extensive rainfall and that the whole structure was carved out of limestone bedrock by an ancient advanced culture (such as the Heavy Neolithic Qaraoun culture). Never taking himself too seriously, he also made a few appearances as &quot;Chuck&quot; in Dame Edna Everage&#x27;s shows, both on stage and on television. Heston appeared in 1993 in a cameo role in &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot;, in a scene where Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) requests casting a better actor for a small role. After the scene is reshot with Heston, Campbell weeps in awe. That same year, Heston hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. He had cameos in the films &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Tombstone&quot;, and &quot;True Lies&quot;.

He starred in many theatre productions at the Los Angeles Music Center, where he appeared in &quot;Detective Story&quot; and &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial&quot;, and as Sherlock Holmes in &quot;The Crucifer of Blood&quot;, opposite Richard Johnson as Dr. Watson. In 2001, he made a cameo appearance as an elderly, dying chimpanzee in Tim Burton&#x27;s remake of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;. His last film role was as Josef Mengele in &quot;Rua Alguem 5555: My Father&quot;, which had limited release (mainly to festivals) in 2003. Heston&#x27;s distinctive voice landed him roles as a film narrator, including the opening scenes of &quot;Armageddon&quot; and Disney&#x27;s &quot;Hercules&quot;. He played the title role in &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; three times and cited it as one of his favorite roles. In the early 1990s, he tried unsuccessfully to revive and direct the show with Tom Selleck in the title role. In 1998, Heston had a cameo role playing himself in the American television series &quot;Friends&quot;, in the episode &quot;The One with Joey&#x27;s Dirty Day&quot;. In 2000, he played Chief Justice Haden Wainwright in &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; episode &quot;Final Appeal&quot;.

==Acting credits and accolades ==
Richard Corliss wrote in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;From start to finish, Heston was a grand, ornery anachronism, the sinewy symbol of a time when Hollywood took itself seriously, when heroes came from history books, not comic books. Epics like &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; or &quot;El Cid&quot; simply couldn&#x27;t be made today, in part because popular culture has changed as much as political fashion. But mainly because there&#x27;s no one remotely like Charlton Heston to infuse the form with his stature, fire, and guts.&quot; In his obituary for the actor, film critic Roger Ebert noted, &quot;Heston made at least three movies that almost everybody eventually sees: &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; and &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;.&quot; Heston&#x27;s cinematic legacy was the subject of &quot;Cinematic Atlas: The Triumphs of Charlton Heston&quot;, an 11-film retrospective by the Film Society of the Lincoln Center that was shown at the Walter Reade Theatre from August 29 to September 4, 2008.

On April 17, 2010, Heston was inducted into the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum&#x27;s Hall of Great Western Performers. In his childhood hometown of St. Helen, Michigan, a charter (independent) school, Charlton Heston Academy, opened on September 4, 2012. It is housed in the former St. Helen Elementary School. Enrollment on the first day was 220 students in grades kindergarten through eighth.

Charlton Heston was commemorated on a United States postage stamp issued on April 11, 2014. Charlton Heston was inducted as a Laureate of the Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State&#x27;s highest honor) by Illinois Governor James R. Thompson in 1977 in the area of Performing Arts.

==Political views ==
Heston&#x27;s political activism had four stages. In the first stage, 1955–1961, he endorsed liberal Democratic candidates for president and signed on to petitions for liberal political causes. From 1961 until 1972, the second stage, he continued to endorse Democratic candidates for president. Moving beyond Hollywood, he became nationally visible in 1963 in support of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. From 1965 until 1971, he served as the elected President of the Screen Actors Guild and clashed with his liberal rival Ed Asner. In 1968, he helped publicize gun control measures when he joined fellow Hollywood stars in support of the Gun Control Act of 1968.

The third stage began in 1972. Heston rejected the liberalism of George McGovern and supported Republican Richard Nixon in 1972 for president. In the 1980s, he gave strong support to Ronald Reagan during his conservative presidency. In 1995, Heston entered his fourth stage by establishing his own political action fund-raising committee and jumped into the internal politics of the National Rifle Association. He gave numerous culture wars speeches and interviews upholding the conservative position, blaming media and academia for imposing affirmative action, which he saw as unfair reverse discrimination.

=== Civil rights advocate ===

Heston campaigned for presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson in 1956, although he was unable to campaign for John F. Kennedy in 1960 because he was filming &quot;El Cid&quot; in Spain. Reportedly, when a segregated Oklahoma movie theater was showing his movie &quot;El Cid&quot; for the first time in 1961, he joined a picket line outside the movie theater. Heston made no reference to this incident in his autobiography but he described traveling to Oklahoma City to picket segregated restaurants, to the chagrin of the producers of &quot;El Cid&quot;, Allied Artists. During the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom held in Washington, D.C., in 1963, he accompanied Martin Luther King Jr. In later speeches, he said he helped the civil rights cause &quot;long before Hollywood found it fashionable&quot;.

In the 1964 election, he endorsed Lyndon B. Johnson, who had masterminded the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 through Congress over the vociferous opposition of southern Democrats. That year, Heston publicly opposed California Proposition 14 that rolled back the state&#x27;s fair housing law, the Rumford Fair Housing Act.

=== Conservative beliefs ===
In his 1995 autobiography, &quot;In the Arena&quot;, written after he became a conservative Republican, Heston wrote that while driving back from the set of &quot;The War Lord&quot;, he saw a &quot;Barry Goldwater for President&quot; billboard with his campaign slogan &quot;In Your Heart You Know He&#x27;s Right&quot; and thought to himself, &quot;Son of a bitch, he right.&quot; Heston later said that his support for Goldwater was the event that helped turn him against gun control laws. Following the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, Heston, Gregory Peck, Kirk Douglas, and James Stewart issued a statement in support of President Johnson&#x27;s Gun Control Act of 1968. The Johnson White House had solicited Heston&#x27;s support. He endorsed Hubert Humphrey in the 1968 presidential election.

=== Vietnam war ===
Heston opposed the Vietnam War during its course (though he changed his opinion in the years following the war) and in 1969 was approached by the Democratic Party to run for the U.S. Senate against incumbent George Murphy. He agonized over the decision but ultimately determined he could never give up acting. He supported Richard Nixon in 1972, though Nixon is not mentioned in his autobiography.

=== Gun rights ===
By the 1980s, Heston supported gun rights and changed his political affiliation from Democratic to Republican. When asked why he changed political alliances, Heston replied &quot;I didn&#x27;t change. The Democratic Party changed.&quot; In 1987, he first registered as a Republican. He campaigned for Republicans and Republican presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush.

=== Culture war ===

Heston resigned in protest from Actors Equity, saying the union&#x27;s refusal to allow a white actor to play a Eurasian role in &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; was &quot;obscenely racist&quot;. Heston charged that CNN&#x27;s telecasts from Baghdad were &quot;sowing doubts&quot; about the allied effort in the 1990–1991 Gulf War. At a Time Warner stockholders&#x27; meeting, Heston castigated the company for releasing an Ice-T album which included a song &quot;Cop Killer&quot; about killing police officers. While filming &quot;The Savage&quot;, Heston was initiated by blood into the Miniconjou Lakota Nation, saying that he had no natural American Indian heritage, but elected to be &quot;Native American&quot; to salvage the term from exclusively referring to American Indians.

In Heston&#x27;s 1997 speech, called &quot;Fighting the Culture War in America&quot;, Heston rhetorically deplored a culture war he said was being conducted by a generation of media people, educators, entertainers, and politicians. He stated, &quot;The Constitution was handed down to guide us by a bunch of wise old dead white guys who invented our country! Now some flinch when I say that. Why! It&#x27;s true ... they were white guys! So were most of the guys that died in Lincoln&#x27;s name opposing slavery in the 1860s. So why should I be ashamed of white guys? Why is &quot;Hispanic Pride&quot; or &quot;Black Pride&quot; a good thing, while &quot;White Pride&quot; conjures shaven heads and white hoods? Why was the Million Man March on Washington celebrated by many as progress, while the Promise Keepers March on Washington was greeted with suspicion and ridicule? I&#x27;ll tell you why: Cultural warfare!&quot; In an address to students at Harvard Law School entitled &quot;Winning the Cultural War&quot;, Heston said, &quot;If Americans believed in political correctness, we&#x27;d still be King George&#x27;s boys—subjects bound to the British crown.&quot;
 He said to the students: &quot;You are the best and the brightest. You, here in this fertile cradle of American academia, here in the castle of learning on the Charles River. You are the cream. But I submit that you and your counterparts across the land are the most socially conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge. And as long as you validate that and abide it, you are, by your grandfathers&#x27; standards, cowards&quot;. During a speech at Brandeis University, he stated, &quot;Political correctness is tyranny with manners&quot;. In a speech to the National Press Club in 1997, Heston said, &quot;Now, I doubt any of you would prefer a rolled up newspaper as a weapon against a dictator or a criminal intruder.&quot;

=== NRA president ===
Heston was the president (a largely ceremonial position) and spokesman of the NRA from 1998 until he resigned in 2003. At the 2000 NRA convention, he raised a rifle over his head and declared that a potential Al Gore administration would take away his Second Amendment rights &quot;from my cold, dead hands&quot;. In announcing his resignation in 2003, he again raised a rifle over his head, repeating the five famous words of his 2000 speech. Heston became an honorary life member.

In the 2002 film &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;, Michael Moore interviewed Heston at Heston&#x27;s home, asking him about an April 1999 meeting the NRA held in Denver, Colorado, shortly after the Columbine High School massacre. Moore criticized Heston for the perceived thoughtlessness in the timing and location of the meeting. When Moore asked Heston for his thoughts on why gun-related homicide is so much higher in the United States than in other countries, Heston said it was because, &quot;we have probably more mixed ethnicity&quot; and/or that &quot;we have a history of violence, perhaps more than most countries&quot;. Heston subsequently, on-camera, excused himself and walked away. Moore was later criticized for having conducted the interview in what some viewed as an ambush. The interview was conducted early in 2001, before Heston publicly announced his Alzheimer&#x27;s diagnosis, but the film was released afterward, causing some to say that Moore should have cut the interview from the final film.

=== Iraq war ===
In April 2003, he sent a message of support to the American forces in the Iraq War, attacking opponents of the war as &quot;pretend patriots&quot;.

=== Abortion views ===
Heston opposed abortion and introduced Bernard Nathanson&#x27;s 1987 anti-abortion documentary, &quot;Eclipse of Reason&quot;, which focuses on late-term abortions. Heston served on the advisory board of Accuracy in Media, a conservative media watchdog group founded by Reed Irvine.

== Personal life ==
In March 1944, Heston married Northwestern University student Lydia Marie Clarke at Grace Methodist Church in downtown Greensboro, North Carolina.

Heston was an Episcopalian, and he has been described as &quot;a spiritual man&quot; with an &quot;earthy flair&quot;, who &quot;respected religious traditions&quot; and &quot;particularly enjoyed the historical aspects of the Christian faith&quot;.

=== Illness and death ===
In 1996, Heston received a hip replacement. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1998. Following a course of radiation treatment, the cancer went into remission. In 2000, he publicly disclosed that he had been treated for alcoholism at a Utah clinic in May–June of that year.

On August 9, 2002, he publicly announced (via a taped message) that he had been diagnosed with symptoms which are consistent with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. In July 2003, in his final public appearance, Heston received the Presidential Medal of Freedom at the White House from President George W. Bush. In March 2005, various newspapers reported that family and friends were shocked by the progression of his illness and that he was sometimes unable to get out of bed.

Heston died on the morning of April 5, 2008, at his home in Beverly Hills, California, with Lydia, his wife of 64 years, by his side. He was 84 years old. Heston is also survived by their son, Fraser Clarke Heston, and their daughter, Holly Ann Heston. The cause of Heston&#x27;s death was not disclosed by his family. A month later, media outlets reported his death was due to pneumonia.

Early tributes came in from leading figures; President George W. Bush called Heston &quot;a man of character and integrity, with a big heart ... He served his country during World War II, marched in the civil rights movement, led a labor union and vigorously defended Americans&#x27; Second Amendment rights.&quot; Former First Lady Nancy Reagan said that she was &quot;heartbroken&quot; over Heston&#x27;s death and released a statement, reading, &quot;I will never forget Chuck as a hero on the big screen in the roles he played, but more importantly I considered him a hero in life for the many times that he stepped up to support Ronnie in whatever he was doing.&quot;

Heston&#x27;s funeral was held a week later on April 12, 2008, in a ceremony which was attended by 250 people including Nancy Reagan and Hollywood stars such as California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Olivia de Havilland, Keith Carradine, Pat Boone, Tom Selleck, Oliver Stone (who had cast Heston in his 1999 movie &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;), Rob Reiner, and Christian Bale.

The funeral was held at Episcopal Parish of St. Matthew&#x27;s Church in Pacific Palisades, the church where Heston had regularly worshipped and attended Sunday services since the early 1980s. He was cremated and his ashes were given to his family.

<doc id="46169" wikidata="Q13373" url="?curid=46169" title="Lucca">
<text>Lucca ( ; ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; in Tuscany, Central Italy, on the Serchio River, in a fertile plain near the Ligurian Sea. The city has a population of about 89,000, while its province has a population of 383,957. 

Lucca is known as an Italian &quot;Città d&#x27;arte&quot; (City of Art) from its intact Renaissance-era city walls and its very well preserved historic center, where, among other buildings and monuments, are located the Piazza dell&#x27;Anfiteatro, which has its origins in the second half of the 1st century A.D., the Guinigi Tower, a tower that dates from the 14th century and the Cathedral of San Martino. 

The city is the birthplace of numerous world-class composers, including Giacomo Puccini, Alfredo Catalani, and Luigi Boccherini.

== Toponymy ==
To the Ancient Romans, Lucca was known as &quot;Luca&quot;. From more recent and concrete toponymic studies, the name Lucca has references that lead to &quot;sacred grove&quot; (Latin: &quot;lucus&quot;), &quot;to cut&quot; (Latin: &quot;lucare&quot;) and &quot;luminous space&quot; (&quot;leuk&quot;, a term used by the first European populations). The origin apparently refers to a wooded area deforested to make room for light or to a clearing located on a river island of Serchio debris, in the middle of wooded areas.

The territory of present-day Lucca was certainly settled by the Etruscans, and it also has traces of a probable earlier Ligurian presence (called &quot;Luk&quot; meaning &quot;marsh&quot;, which was previously speculated as a possible origin of the city&#x27;s name), dating from the 3rd century BC. However, it was only with the arrival of the Romans that the area took on the appearance of a real town. It obtained the status of a Roman colony in 180 BC and of a municipality (municipium) in 89 BC.

The rectangular grid of its historical centre preserves the Roman street plan, and the Piazza San Michele occupies the site of the ancient forum. The outline of the Roman amphitheatre is still seen in the Piazza dell&#x27;Anfiteatro, and the outline of a Roman theater is visible in Piazza Sant&#x27;Augostino. Fragments of the Roman-era walls are incorporated into the church of Santa Maria della Rosa.

At the Luca Conference, in 56 BC, Julius Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus reaffirmed their political alliance known as the First Triumvirate.

=== Middle Ages ===

Frediano, an Irish monk, was bishop of Lucca in the early sixth century. At one point, Lucca was plundered by Odoacer, the first Germanic King of Italy. Lucca was an important city and fortress even in the sixth century, when Narses besieged it for several months in 553. From 576 to 797, under the Lombards, it was the capital of a duchy, known as Duchy of Tuscia, which included a large part of today&#x27;s Tuscany and the province of Viterbo, during this time the city also minted its own coins. The Holy Face of Lucca (or Volto Santo), a major relic supposedly carved by Nicodemus, arrived in 742. 

Among the population that inhabited Lucca in the medieval era, there was also a significant presence of Jews. The first mention of their presence in the city is from a document from the year 859. The Jewish community was led by the Kalonymos family (which later became a major component of proto-Ashkenazic Jewry). 

Thanks above all to the Holy Face and to the relics of important saints, such as San Regolo and Saint Fridianus, the city was one of the main destinations of the Via Francigena, the major pilgrimage route to Rome from the north.

The Lucca cloth was a silk fabric that was woven with gold or silver threads. It was a popular type of textile in Lucca throughout the mediaeval period. 

Lucca became prosperous through the silk trade that began in the eleventh century, and came to rival the silks of Byzantium. During the tenth–eleventh centuries Lucca was the capital of the feudal margraviate of Tuscany, more or less independent but owing nominal allegiance to the Holy Roman Emperor. 

In 1057, Anselm of Baggio (later Pope Alexander II) was appointed bishop of Lucca, a position he held also during the papacy. As bishop of Lucca he managed to rebuild the patrimony of the Church of Lucca, recovering alienated assets, obtaining numerous donations thanks to his prestige, and had the Cathedral of the city rebuilt. From 1073 to 1086, the bishop of Lucca was his nephew Anselm II, a prominent figure in the Investiture Controversy.

During the High Middle Ages, one of the most illustrious dynasties of Lucca was the noble Allucingoli family, who managed to forge strong ties with the Church. Among the family members were Ubaldo Allucingoli, who was elected to the Papacy as Pope Lucius III in 1181, and the Cardinals Gerardo Allucingoli and Uberto Allucingoli.

=== Republican period (12th to 19th century) ===

After the death of Matilda of Tuscany, the city began to constitute itself an independent commune with a charter in 1160. For almost 500 years, Lucca remained an independent republic. There were many minor provinces in the region between southern Liguria and northern Tuscany dominated by the Malaspina; Tuscany in this time was a part of feudal Europe. Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; includes many references to the great feudal families who had huge jurisdictions with administrative and judicial rights. Dante spent some of his exile in Lucca.

In 1273 and again in 1277, Lucca was ruled by a Guelph &quot;capitano del popolo&quot; (captain of the people) named Luchetto Gattilusio. In 1314, internal discord allowed Uguccione della Faggiuola of Pisa to make himself lord of Lucca. The Lucchesi expelled him two years later, and handed over the city to another &quot;condottiero&quot;, Castruccio Castracani, under whose rule it became a leading state in central Italy. Lucca rivalled Florence until Castracani&#x27;s death in 1328. On 22 and 23 September 1325, in the battle of Altopascio, Castracani defeated Florence&#x27;s Guelphs. For this he was nominated by Louis IV the Bavarian to become duke of Lucca. Castracani&#x27;s tomb is in the church of San Francesco. His biography is Machiavelli&#x27;s third famous book on political rule.

Occupied by the troops of Louis of Bavaria, the city was sold to a rich Genoese, Gherardino Spinola, then seized by John, king of Bohemia. Pawned to the Rossi of Parma, by them it was ceded to Mastino II della Scala of Verona, sold to the Florentines, surrendered to the Pisans, and then nominally liberated by the emperor Charles IV and governed by his vicar.

In 1408, Lucca hosted a convocation organized by Pope Gregory XII with his cardinals intended to end the schism in the papacy.

Lucca managed, at first as a democracy, and after 1628 as an oligarchy, to maintain its independence alongside of Venice and Genoa, and painted the word &quot;Libertas&quot; on its banner until the French Revolution in 1789.

===Early modern period===
Lucca had been the second largest Italian city state (after Venice) with a republican constitution (&quot;comune&quot;) to remain independent over the centuries.

Between 1799 and 1800, it was contested by the French and Austrian armies. Finally the French prevailed and granted a democratic constitution in the 1801. However, already in 1805 the Republic of Lucca was converted into a monarchy by Napoleon, who installed his sister Elisa Bonaparte Baciocchi as &quot;Princess of Lucca&quot;.

From 1815 to 1847, it was a Bourbon-Parma duchy. The only reigning dukes of Lucca were Maria Luisa of Spain, who was succeeded by her son Charles II, Duke of Parma in 1824. Meanwhile, the Duchy of Parma had been assigned for life to Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma, the second wife of Napoleon. In accordance with the Treaty of Vienna (1815), upon the death of Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma in 1847, Parma reverted to Charles II, Duke of Parma, while Lucca lost independence and was annexed to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. As part of Tuscany, it became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860 and finally part of the Italian State in 1861.

===World War II internment camp===

In 1942, during World War II, a prisoner-of-war camp was established at the village of Colle di Compito, in the municipality of Capannori, about from Lucca. Its official number was P.G. (&quot;prigionieri di guerra&quot;) 60, and it was usually referred to as PG 60 Lucca. Although it never had permanent structures and accommodation consisted of tents in an area prone to flooding, it housed more than 3,000 British and Commonwealth prisoners of war during the period of its existence. It was handed over to the Germans on 10 September 1943, not long after the signing of the Italian armistice. During the Italian Social Republic, as a puppet state of the Germans, political prisoners, foreigners, common law prisoners and Jews were interned there, and it functioned as a concentration camp. In June 1944, the prisoners were moved to Bagni di Lucca.

==Main sights==


===Walls, streets, and squares===
The walls encircling the old town remain intact, even though the city has expanded and been modernised, which is unusual for cities in this region. These walls were built initially as a defensive rampart which, after losing their military importance, became a pedestrian promenade (the Passeggiata delle Mure Urbane) atop the walls which not only links the Bastions of Santa Croce, San Frediano, San Martino, San Pietro/Battisti, San Salvatore, La Libertà/Cairoli, San Regolo, San Colombano, Santa Maria, San Paolino/Catalani and San Donato but also passes over the gates (Porte) of San Donato, Santa Maria, San Jacopo, Elisa, San Pietro, and Sant&#x27;Anna. Each of the four principal sides of the structure is lined with a tree species different from the others.

The walled city is encircled by Piazzale Boccherini, Viale Lazzaro Papi, Viale Carlo Del Prete, Piazzale Martiri della Libertà, Via Batoni, Viale Agostino Marti, Viale G. Marconi (&quot;vide&quot; Guglielmo Marconi), Piazza Don A. Mei, Viale Pacini, Viale Giusti, Piazza Curtatone, Piazzale Ricasoli, Viale Ricasoli, Piazza Risorgimento (&quot;vide&quot; Risorgimento), and Viale Giosuè Carducci.

The town includes a number of public squares, most notably the Piazza dell&#x27;Anfiteatro, (site of the ancient Roman amphitheater), the Piazzale Verdi, the Piazza Napoleone, and the Piazza San Michele.

The club plays its home games at Stadio Porta Elisa, just outside the northeast wall of the city.

===Buses===
Consorzio Lucchese Autotrasporti Pubblici, also known as CLAP, was established in 1969, as the main company in the Province of Lucca to manage the local public transport. In 2005, following the decision of the Region to assign the local public transport to a single operator for each of the 14 lots constituted, CLAP merged with the companies Lazzi and C.LU.B. Scpa to form the consortium VaiBus which was absorbed by the newly formed company CTT Nord in 2012. VaiBus was part of ONE Scarl the consortium holder of the two-year (2018-2019) contract for the management of the TPL throughout the Region.

<text>Siderno ( or ; ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the Metropolitan City of Reggio Calabria, Calabria, southern Italy, about 3 kilometres from Locri. 

Siderno Marina is the newer town located on the Ionian coast. It is a destination for both Italian and foreign tourists and has a bathing beach.

Siderno Superiore is the old town, higher up on the flank of the coastal mountain range. It has historic palaces, old buildings and very narrow streets. Its population has largely relocated to the Marina which offers more job opportunities and services.

==History==
The early history of the town is unknown. The old town in the hilly inland was probably founded in the 10th century by some people from Locri, who had fled to the area to defend themselves from Saracen incursions; in the following century it became a hamlet of the county of Grotteria and was home to various feudal lords. Siderno Marina was built along the coast after the 1783 earthquake.

=== Geography ===
==Climate ==

===Emigration===
Large-scale emigration abroad as well as to Northern Italy, which began to diminish only in the 1970s, has had a lasting effect on the demographic situation in the region. Emigrants from Siderno immigrated to the United States, Canada and Australia since the end of the 19th century to find employment.

Many moved to Canada settled in Schreiber, Ontario due to then-ongoing construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Half of Schreiber&#x27;s 2,000 residents trace their roots to Siderno.

==Economy==
Siderno is a tourist resort on the Ionian coast of the province of Reggio Calabria, with wide, sandy beaches, and a clear sea .

The Siderno area is a center of production of bergamot orange, a citrus fruit that is used as an essence and fundamental ingredient in cosmetics, for its wound healing properties in the pharmaceutical industry, and for flavouring in the food industry.

==Crime==

The town is home to the &#x27;Ndrangheta, a Mafia-type criminal organization based in Calabria. Several powerful criminal clans originate from the town. Siderno was the fiefdom of Antonio Macrì, the undisputed local boss until his demise in January 1975. Several of the criminal clans are sometimes involved in bloody feuds. The town is home to one of the &#x27;Ndrangheta&#x27;s biggest and most important clans, the Commisso &#x27;ndrina, heavily involved in the global cocaine business and money laundering.

Several clans moved to Canada, in particular the Greater Toronto Area, home to what Canadian law enforcement call the Siderno Group, which has been here since at least the 1950s. &quot;The criminal minds of Siderno are in Canada&quot;, according to the Siderno police force. One of them, Antonio Commisso, was arrested in June 2005. Individuals related to the so-called Siderno Group were still active in Southern Ontario in 2018.

==People==
* Antonio Commisso (born 1956), &#x27;Ndrangheta boss
* Antonio Macrì (1902–1975), historical &#x27;Ndrangheta boss
* Francesco Panetta (born 1963), former long-distance runner

He was responsible for the operation that led to the Death of Osama bin Laden, the leader and founder of al-Qaeda and the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks
*&#x27;Ndrangheta, Italy&#x27;s most powerful organized crime syndicate has their roots in Siderno, and continue to use this city as a base of operations.

<text>Fish and chips is a hot dish consisting of battered and fried fish, served with chips. Often considered the national dish of the United Kingdom, fish and chips originated in England in the 19th century. Today, the dish is a common takeaway food in numerous other countries, particularly English-speaking and Commonwealth nations.

Fish and chip shops first appeared in the UK in the 1860s, and by 1910 there were over 25,000 of them across the UK. This increased to over 35,000 by the 1930s, but eventually decreased to approximately 10,000 by 2009. The British government safeguarded the supply of fish and chips during the First World War and again in the Second World War. It was one of the few foods in the UK not subject to rationing during the wars, which further contributed to its popularity.

==History==
The British tradition of eating fish battered and fried in oil may have been introduced to the country by the Chuts: Spanish and Portuguese Jews, who had lived in the Netherlands before settling in the UK. These immigrants arrived as early as the 16th century, the main immigration to London being during the 1850s. They prepared fried fish in a manner similar to &quot;pescado frito&quot;, which is coated in flour then fried in oil. Fish fried for Shabbat for dinner on Friday evenings could be eaten cold the following afternoon for shalosh seudot, palatable this way as liquid vegetable oil was used rather than a hard fat, such as butter. Charles Dickens mentions &quot;fried fish warehouses&quot; in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1838), and in 1845 Alexis Soyer in his first edition of &quot;A Shilling Cookery for the People&quot;, gives a recipe for &quot;fried fish, Jewish fashion&quot;, which is dipped in a batter mix of flour and water before frying. However, &quot;fish the Jews&#x27; way&quot; in most English cookery books usually refer not to plain fried fish, but to escabeche, fish fried then pickled in vinegar.
The location of the first fish and chip shop is unclear. The earliest known shops were opened in London during the 1860s by Eastern European Jewish immigrant Joseph Malin, and by John Lees in Mossley, Lancashire. Fried fish and chips had existed separately for at least 50 years prior to this, so the possibility that they had been combined at an earlier time cannot be ruled out. Fish and chips became a stock meal among the working class in England as a consequence of the rapid development of trawl fishing in the North Sea, and the development of railways which connected the ports to major industrial cities during the second half of the 19th century, so that fresh fish could be rapidly transported to the cities.

Deep-fried chips (slices or pieces of potato) as a dish may have first appeared in England in about the same period: the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; notes as its earliest usage of &quot;chips&quot; in this sense the mention in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1859): &quot;husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant drops of oil&quot;.

The modern fish-and-chip shop (&quot;chippy&quot; in modern British slang) originated in the UK, although outlets selling fried food occurred commonly throughout Europe. Early fish-and-chip shops had only very basic facilities. Usually these consisted principally of a large cauldron of cooking fat, heated by a coal fire. The fish-and-chip shop later evolved into a fairly standard format, with the food served, in paper wrappings, to queuing customers, over a counter in front of the fryers. According to Professor John Walton, author of &quot;Fish and Chips and the British Working Class&quot;, the British government made safeguarding supplies of fish and chips during the First World War a priority: &quot;The cabinet knew it was vital to keep families on the home front in good heart, unlike the German regime that failed to keep its people well fed&quot;.
In 1928, Harry Ramsden opened his first fish and chip shop in Guiseley, West Yorkshire. On a single day in 1952, the shop served 10,000 portions of fish and chips, earning a place in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;. In George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot; (1937), which documents his experience of working-class life in the North of England, the author considered fish and chips chief among the &#x27;home comforts&#x27; which acted as a panacea to the working classes.

During the Second World War, fish and chips—a staple of the working class—remained one of the few foods in the United Kingdom not subject to rationing. Prime Minister Winston Churchill referred to the combination of fish and chips as &quot;the good companions&quot;.

British fish and chips were originally served in a wrapping of old newspapers but this practice has now largely ceased, with plain paper, cardboard, or plastic being used instead. In the UK, the Fish Labelling Regulations 2003, and in the Republic of Ireland the European Communities (Labelling of Fishery and Aquaculture Products) Regulations 2003, respectively enact directive 2065/2001/EC, and generally mean that &quot;fish&quot; must be sold with the particular commercial name or species named; so, for example, &quot;cod and chips&quot; now appears on menus rather than the more vague &quot;fish and chips&quot;. In the UK the Food Standards Agency guidance excludes caterers from this; but several local Trading Standards authorities and others do say it cannot be sold merely as &quot;fish and chips&quot;.

===United Kingdom===
A prominent meal in British culture, fish and chips became popular in wider circles in London and South East England in the middle of the 19th century: Charles Dickens mentions a &quot;fried fish warehouse&quot; in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, first published in 1838, while in the north of England a trade in deep-fried chipped potatoes developed. It remains unclear exactly when and where these two trades combined to become the modern fish and chip shop industry. A Jewish immigrant, Joseph Malin, opened the first recorded combined fish-and-chip shop in Bow, East London, circa 1860; a Mr Lees pioneered the concept in the North of England, in Mossley, in 1863. A century later, the National Federation of Fish Friers, which made Malin&#x27;s its first member, presented a plaque to Malin&#x27;s as being the world&#x27;s first fish and chip shop. A blue plaque is located at the other main contender for the first fish and chip shop, the present site of Oldham&#x27;s Tommyfield Market. Located in Covent Garden, The Rock &amp; Sole Plaice, dating from 1871, is London&#x27;s oldest fish and chip shop still in operation. 

The concept of a sit-down fish restaurant—as opposed to takeaway—was introduced by Samuel Isaacs, an entrepreneur from Whitechapel, East London who ran a thriving wholesale and retail fish business. Dubbed the &#x27;Fish Restaurant King&#x27;, Isaacs&#x27; first restaurant opened in Lambeth, South London in 1896 serving fish and chips, bread and butter, and tea for nine pence. It became instantly popular and led to a chain which comprised 22 restaurants. Isaacs&#x27; trademark was the phrase &quot;This is the Plaice&quot;, combined with a picture of the punned-upon fish in question, which appeared in all of his restaurants. Isaacs&#x27; restaurants were carpeted, had table service, tablecloths, flowers, china and cutlery, and made the trappings of upmarket dining affordable to the working classes. They were located in the Strand and other London locations, as well as Brighton, Ramsgate, Margate and other seaside resorts in southern England. Menus were expanded in the early 20th century to include meat dishes and other variations. A glimpse of the old Brighton restaurant at No.1 Marine Parade can be seen in the background of Norman Wisdom&#x27;s 1955 film &quot;One Good Turn&quot; just as Pitkin runs onto the seafront; this is now the site of a Harry Ramsden&#x27;s fish and chips restaurant. 

From their first appearance on the British High Street in the early 1860s, fish and chip shops spread rapidly in order to satisfy the needs of the growing industrial population. By 1910, there were over 25,000 fish and chip shops across the UK, a figure that grew to over 35,000 shops by the 1930s. Since then the trend has reversed, and in 2009 there were approximately 10,000 shops.

==== Scotland ====
Dundee City Council claims that chips were first sold by a Belgian immigrant, Edward De Gernier, in the city&#x27;s Greenmarket in the 1870s. In Edinburgh and the surrounding area, a combination of Gold Star brown sauce and water or malt vinegar, known as &quot;sauce&quot;, or more specifically as &quot;chippy sauce&quot;, has great popularity; salt and vinegar is preferred elsewhere in Scotland.

==== Fish &amp; Chips Awards ====
The annual National Fish &amp; Chips Awards were set up in the UK in 1988. The 30th Annual Fish &amp; Chips Awards ceremony was attended by Norwegian ambassador to the UK Mona Juul.

===Australia===
The first recorded owner of an Australian fish and chip shop is Greek migrant Athanasias Comino, who opened his shop in 1879 on Sydney&#x27;s Oxford Street, though Comino&#x27;s shop was inspired by an unknown Welshman&#x27;s pre-existing fish and chip shop. In Australia today, there are an estimated 4000 fish and chip shops, as well as fish and chips being an essential menu offering in many Australian pubs and restaurants.

===Canada===

Fish and chips is a widely popular dish in Canada, sometimes using haddock or local lake-caught fish like perch or walleye. Most shops also sell poutine and other fried items. In the province of Newfoundland &amp; Labrador, fish and chips made with cod are a staple food and the most common takeout meal.

===Ireland===

In Ireland, the first fish and chips were sold by an Italian immigrant, Giuseppe Cervi, who mistakenly stepped off a North America-bound ship at Queenstown (now Cobh) in County Cork in the 1880s and walked all the way to Dublin. He started by selling fish and chips outside Dublin pubs from a handcart. He then found a permanent spot in Great Brunswick Street (now Pearse Street). His wife Palma would ask customers &quot;Uno di questa, uno di quella?&quot; This phrase (meaning &quot;one of this, one of that&quot;) entered the vernacular in Dublin as &quot;one and one&quot;, which is still a way of referring to fish and chips in the city.

===New Zealand===

Fish and chips is the most popular takeaway food in New Zealand. Food historians have not been able to pinpoint exactly when the meal became an established part of New Zealand cuisine, but all recognise that the first fish and chips shops were introduced by British settlers before World War I. During the 20th century, nearly every small town and suburb in New Zealand had at least one fish-and-chip shop. As in Britain, Friday night has been the traditional night to eat fish.

Traditionally, fish and chips were served in wrappings of greaseproof paper and then newspaper as insulation. With the decline of the newspaper industry, this has become less common although plain, unprinted paper is still popular.

In 1980, four up-and-coming New Zealand Labour Party politicians, including David Lange, were nicknamed the &quot;Fish and Chip Brigade&quot; due to a picture published at the time with the group eating fish and chips.

===United States===

In the United States, the dish is most commonly sold as &quot;fish and chips&quot;, except in Upstate New York and Wisconsin and other parts of the Northeast and Upper Midwest, where this dish would be called a &quot;fish fry&quot;. While in the United States &quot;chips&quot; refers to potato chips (&quot;crisps&quot; in British English), the dish retains its native name. In the Southern United States, a common form of cuisine is fried catfish with French fries, accompanied by coleslaw, pickles, raw onion slices and lemon slices.

===Other countries===
The western Norwegian town of Kristiansund has had a tradition with fish and chips as street food since the 1940s. It is known locally as &quot;fishan&quot;.

==Composition==

===Choice of fish===
In Britain and Ireland, cod and haddock appear most commonly as the fish used for fish and chips, but vendors also sell many other kinds of fish, especially other white fish, such as pollock, hake or coley, plaice, skate, ray, and huss or rock salmon (a term covering several species of dogfish and similar fish). In traditional fish and chip shops several varieties of fish are offered by name (&quot;haddock and chips&quot;), but in some restaurants and stalls &quot;fish and chips&quot;, unspecified, is offered; it is increasingly likely to be the much cheaper basa. In Northern Ireland, cod, plaice or whiting appear most commonly in &#x27;fish suppers&#x27;—&#x27;supper&#x27; being Scottish and Northern Irish terminology for a food item accompanied by chips. Suppliers in Devon and Cornwall often offer pollock and coley as cheap alternatives to haddock.
In Australia, reef cod and rock cod (a variety different from that used in the United Kingdom), barramundi or flathead (more expensive options), flake (a type of shark meat), King George whiting (little more expensive than other fish, but cheaper than barramundi or flathead) or snapper (cheaper options), are commonly used. From the early 21st century, farmed basa imported from Vietnam and hoki have become common in Australian fish and chip shops. Other types of fish are also used based on regional availability.

In New Zealand, snapper or gurnard was originally the preferred species for battered fillets in the North Island. As catches of this fish declined, it was replaced by hoki, shark (particularly rig) – marketed as lemon fish – and tarakihi. Bluefin gurnard and blue cod predominate in South Island fish and chips.

In the United States, the type of fish used depends on availability in a given region. Some common types are cod, halibut, flounder, tilapia or, in New England, Atlantic cod or haddock.

In India, the dish is usually based on beckti or pomfret and uses chilli paste, and more pepper than would be used in Britain.

In South Africa, hake and snoek are common choices.

===Cooking===

Traditional frying uses beef dripping or lard; however, vegetable oils, such as palm oil, rapeseed or peanut oil (used because of its relatively high smoke point) predominate, in part because it makes fried chips suitable for vegetarians and for adherents of certain faiths.

There is a longstanding debate among vendors in the UK on whether beef dripping or vegetable oil is the best way to fry fish and chips. The traditional method of dripping or lard are used in some living industrial history museums, such as the Black Country and Beamish Living Museums in England. 

The fish part of the dish is filleted, and no bones should be found in the fish.

===Batter===
In Britain and Ireland, fish and chip shops traditionally use a simple water and flour batter, adding a little sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and a little vinegar to create lightness, as they react to create bubbles in the batter. Other recipes may use beer or milk batter, where these liquids are often substitutes for water. The carbon dioxide in the beer lends a lighter texture to the batter. Beer also results in an orange-brown colour. A simple beer batter might consist of a 2:3 ratio of flour to beer by volume. The type of beer alters the taste of the batter; some prefer lager whereas others use stout or bitter.

===Chips===
British chips are usually considerably thicker than American-style French fries. Some US restaurants and some people in their home cooking may use a thick type of chip, similar to the British variant, sometimes referred to as &quot;steak fries&quot;.

===Accompaniments===

In chip shops in most parts of Britain and Ireland, salt and vinegar are traditionally sprinkled over fish and chips at the time it is served. Suppliers use malt vinegar, onion vinegar (used for pickling onions), or the cheaper non-brewed condiment. In a few places, notably Edinburgh, &#x27;sauce&#x27; (as in &#x27;salt and sauce&#x27;) is more traditional than vinegar—with &#x27;sauce&#x27; meaning a brown sauce. In England, a portion of mushy peas is a popular side dish, as are a range of pickles that typically include gherkins, onions and eggs. In table-service restaurants and pubs, the dish is usually served with a slice of lemon for squeezing over the fish and without any sauces or condiments, with salt, vinegar and sauces available at the customer&#x27;s leisure. Ketchup is also a popular addition (a 2020 YouGov poll in the UK saw ketchup, curry sauce and mushy peas as the top three toppings after salt and vinegar).

In Ireland, Wales and England, many takeaways serve warm side portions of sauces such as curry sauce or gravy, if requested and normally for a small extra fee (curry sauce topped the poll in Wales with one in three using it as a topping). The sauces are usually poured over the chips. In the Midlands especially, chips with mushy peas or baked beans are known as a &quot;pea mix&quot; or a &quot;bean mix&quot;. 
Other fried products include &#x27;scraps&#x27; (also known as &#x27;bits&#x27; in Southern England and &quot;scrumps&quot; in South Wales), originally a by-product of fish frying. Still popular in Northern England, they were given as treats to the children of customers. Portions prepared and sold today consist of loose blobs of batter, deep-fried to a crunchy golden crisp in the cooking fat. The potato scallop or potato cake consists of slices of potato dipped in fish batter and deep-fried until golden brown. These are often accompanied for dipping by the warm sauces listed above.

In Sheffield, Yorkshire fishcakes are made by sandwiching a piece of fish between two slices of potato and deep frying it in batter. This is commonly sold in a bread bun and known as a Fishcake Butty.

===Nutrition information===
An average serving of fish and chips consisting of of fried fish with of fried chips has approximately calories and contains approximately of fat. The use of tartar sauce as a condiment adds more calories and fat to the dish.

==Vendors==

In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa, fish and chips are usually sold by independent restaurants and take-aways known as fish and chip shops. Outlets range from small affairs to chain restaurants. Locally owned seafood restaurants are also popular in many places, as are mobile &quot;chip vans&quot;. In Canada, the outlets may be referred to as &quot;chip wagons&quot;. 

In Ireland, the majority of traditional vendors are migrants or the descendants of migrants from southern Italy. A trade organisation exists to represent this tradition. In New Zealand and Australia, fish-and-chip vendors are a popular business and source of income among the Asian community, particularly Chinese migrants. In Indonesia, fish and chips are commonly found in western and seafood restaurants in large cities, as well as chain restaurants like The Manhattan Fish Market, Fish &amp; Chips, etc.

Many British establishments have humorous or pun-based names, such as, &quot;A Salt and Battery&quot;, &quot;The Codfather&quot;, &quot;The Frying Scotsman&quot;, &quot;Oh My Cod&quot;, &quot;Frying Nemo&quot;, &quot;Rock and Sole&quot; and &quot;Jack the Chipper&quot;. The numerous competitions and awards for &quot;best fish-and-chip shop&quot; testify to the recognised status of this type of outlet in popular culture.
Fish and chips is a popular lunch meal eaten by families travelling to seaside resorts for day trips who do not bring their own picnic meals.

Fish-and-chip outlets sell roughly 25% of all the white fish consumed in the United Kingdom, and 10% of all potatoes.

Fish-and-chip shops traditionally wrapped their product in newspaper, or with an inner layer of white paper (for hygiene) and an outer layer of newspaper or blank newsprint (for insulation and to absorb grease), though the use of newspaper for wrapping has almost ceased on grounds of hygiene. , establishments usually use food-quality wrapping paper, or recyclable cardboard boxes.

The British National Federation of Fish Friers was founded in 1913. It promotes fish and chips and offers training courses. It has about 8,500 members from around the UK.

A previous world record for the &quot;largest serving of fish and chips&quot; was held by Gadaleto&#x27;s Seafood Market in New Paltz, New York. This 2004 record was broken by Yorkshire pub Wensleydale Heifer in July 2011. An attempt to break this record was made by Doncaster fish and chip shop Scawsby Fisheries in August 2012, which served of battered cod alongside of chips. Current record is held by Resorts World Birmingham which served a fish and chips weighing from a raw filet of halibut on 9 February 2018.

==Cultural impact==

The long-standing Roman Catholic tradition of not eating meat on Fridays, especially during Lent, and of substituting fish for meat on that day continues to influence habits even in predominantly Protestant, semi-secular and secular societies. Friday night remains a traditional occasion for eating fish and chips; many cafeterias and similar establishments, while varying their menus on other days of the week, habitually offer fish and chips every Friday.

In 1967, inspired by the use of salt and vinegar as condiments for fish and chips in the UK, the Smiths Potato Crisps Company created Salt &amp; Vinegar flavour crisps.

In Australia and New Zealand, the words &quot;fish and chips&quot; are often used as a shibboleth to highlight the difference in each country&#x27;s short-i vowel sound . Australian English has a higher forward sound , close to the &quot;ee&quot; in &quot;see&quot; (but shorter), while New Zealand English has a lower backward sound akin to the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;Rosa&#x27;s&quot; (but not in &quot;Rosa&quot;, which is typically lower ). Thus, New Zealanders hear Australians say &quot;feesh and cheeps,&quot; while Australians hear New Zealanders say &quot;fush and chups.&quot;

==Environment==
In the UK, waste oil from fish and chip shops has become a useful source of biodiesel. The German biodiesel company Petrotec has outlined plans to produce biodiesel in the UK using waste oil from the British fish-and-chip industry.

<text>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the primary agency of the United States government responsible for biomedical and public health research. It was founded in 1887 and is now part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. Many NIH facilities are located in Bethesda, Maryland, and other nearby suburbs of the Washington metropolitan area, with other primary facilities in the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina and smaller satellite facilities located around the United States.

The NIH conducts its scientific research through the NIH Intramural Research Program (IRP) and provides significant biomedical research funding to non-NIH research facilities through its Extramural Research Program. , the IRP had 1,200 principal investigators and more than 4,000 postdoctoral fellows in basic, translational, and clinical research, being the largest biomedical research institution in the world, while, as of 2003, the extramural arm provided 28% of biomedical research funding spent annually in the U.S., or about US$26.4 billion.

The NIH was responsible for many scientific accomplishments, including the discovery of fluoride to prevent tooth decay, the use of lithium to manage bipolar disorder, and the creation of vaccines against hepatitis, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; (HIB), and human papillomavirus (HPV). In 2012, the NIH comprised 27 separate institutes and centers of different biomedical disciplines. 

In 2019, the NIH was ranked number two in the world, behind Harvard University, for biomedical sciences in the Nature Index, which measured the largest contributors to papers published in a subset of leading journals from 2015 to 2018.

==History==
=== Origins ===


In 1887, a laboratory for the study of bacteria, the Hygienic Laboratory, was established within the Marine Hospital Service, which at the time was expanding its functions beyond the system of Marine Hospitals into quarantine and research programs. It was initially located at the New York Marine Hospital on Staten Island. In 1891, it moved to the top floor of the Butler Building in Washington, D.C. In 1904, it moved again to a new campus at the Old Naval Observatory, which grew to include five major buildings.

In 1901, the Division of Scientific Research was formed, which included the Hygienic Laboratory as well as other research offices of the Marine Hospital Service. In 1912, the Marine Hospital Service became the Public Health Service (PHS). In 1922, PHS established a Special Cancer Investigations laboratory at Harvard Medical School. This development marked the beginning of partnerships with universities.

In 1930, the Hygienic Laboratory was re-designated as the National Institute of Health by the Ransdell Act, and was given $750,000 to construct two NIH buildings at the Old Naval Observatory campus. In 1937, the NIH absorbed the rest of the Division of Scientific Research, of which it was formerly part.

In 1938, the NIH moved to its current campus in Bethesda, Maryland. Over the next few decades, Congress would markedly increase funding of the NIH. Various institutes and centers within the NIH were created for specific research programs. In 1944, the Public Health Service Act was approved and the National Cancer Institute became a division of the NIH. In 1948, the name changed from National Institute of Health to National Institutes of Health.

=== Later history ===
In the 1960s, virologist and cancer researcher Chester M. Southam injected HeLa cancer cells into patients at the Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital. When three doctors resigned after refusing to inject patients without their consent, the experiment gained considerable media attention. The NIH was a major source of funding for Southam&#x27;s research and required all research involving human subjects to obtain their consent before any experimentation. Upon investigating all of their grantee institutions, the NIH discovered that the majority of them did not protect the rights of human subjects. From then on, the NIH has required all grantee institutions to approve any research proposals involving human experimentation with review boards.

In 1967, the Division of Regional Medical Programs was created to administer grants for research for heart disease, cancer, and strokes. That same year, the NIH director lobbied the White House for increased federal funding to increase research and the speed with which health benefits could be brought to the people. An advisory committee was formed to oversee the further development of the NIH and its research programs. By 1971, cancer research was in full force, and President Nixon signed the National Cancer Act, initiating a National Cancer Program, President&#x27;s Cancer Panel, National Cancer Advisory Board, and 15 new research, training, and demonstration centers.

Funding for the NIH has often been a source of contention in the US Congress, serving as a proxy for the political currents of the time. In 1992, the NIH encompassed nearly one percent of the federal government&#x27;s operating budget and controlled more than 50 percent of all funding for health research, and 85 percent of all funding for health studies in universities. While government funding for research in other disciplines has been increasing at a rate similar to inflation since the 1970s, research funding for the NIH nearly tripled through the 1990s and early 2000s, but has remained relatively stagnant since then.

By the 1990s, the NIH committee focus had shifted to DNA research and launched the Human Genome Project.

On January 22, 2025, the Trump administration imposed an immediate freeze on meetings – such as grant review panels – as well as travel, communications, and hiring at the NIH, impacting $47.4 billion worth of activities.

==Leadership==

The NIH Office of the Director is the central office responsible for setting policy for the NIH, and for planning, managing, and coordinating the programs and activities of all NIH components. The NIH Director plays an active role in shaping the agency&#x27;s activities and outlook. The Director is responsible for providing leadership to the Institutes and Centers by identifying needs and opportunities, especially in efforts involving multiple Institutes. Within the Director&#x27;s Office is the Division of Program Coordination, Planning and Strategic Initiatives with 12 divisions including:
* Office of AIDS Research
* Office of Research on Women&#x27;s Health
* Office of Disease Prevention
* Sexual and Gender Minority Research Office
* Tribal Health Research Office
* Office of Program Evaluation and Performance

The Agency Intramural Research Integrity Officer &quot;is directly responsible for overseeing the resolution of all research misconduct allegations involving intramural research, and for promoting research integrity within the NIH Office of Intramural Research (OIR).&quot; There is a Division of Extramural Activities, which has its own Director. The Office of Ethics has its own Director, as does the Office of Global Research.

==Locations and campuses==
Intramural research is primarily conducted at the main campus in Bethesda, Maryland, and Rockville, Maryland, and the surrounding communities.

The Bayview Campus in Baltimore, Maryland houses the research programs of the National Institute on Aging, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and National Human Genome Research Institute with nearly 1,000 scientists and support staff. The Frederick National Laboratory in Frederick, MD and the nearby Riverside Research Park, houses many components of the National Cancer Institute, including the Center for Cancer Research, Office of Scientific Operations, Management Operations Support Branch, the division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics and the division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis.

The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is located in the Research Triangle region of North Carolina.

Other ICs have satellite locations in addition to operations at the main campus. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases maintains its Rocky Mountain Labs in Hamilton, Montana, with an emphasis on BSL3 and BSL4 laboratory work. NIDDK operates the Phoenix Epidemiology and Clinical Research Branch in Phoenix, Arizona.

==Research==
As of 2017, 153 scientists receiving financial support from the NIH have been awarded a Nobel Prize and 195 have been awarded a Lasker Award.

=== Intramural and extramural research ===
In 2019, the NIH devoted 10% of its funding to research within its own facilities (intramural research), and gave &gt;80% of its funding in research grants to extramural (outside) researchers. Of this extramural funding, a certain percentage (2.8% in 2014) must be granted to small businesses under the SBIR/STTR program. , the extramural funding consisted of about 50,000 grants to more than 325,000 researchers at more than 3000 institutions. , this rate of granting remained reasonably steady, at 47,000 grants to 2,700 organizations. , the NIH spent (not including temporary funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009) on clinical research, on genetics-related research, on prevention research, on cancer, and on biotechnology.

===Public Access Policy===

In 2008 a Congressional mandate called for investigators funded by the NIH to submit an electronic version of their final manuscripts to the National Library of Medicine&#x27;s research repository, PubMed Central (PMC), no later than 12 months after the official date of publication. The NIH Public Access Policy was the first public access mandate for a U.S. public funding agency.

===Economic return===
In 2000, the Joint Economic Committee of Congress reported NIH research, which was funded at $16 billion a year in 2000, that some econometric studies had given a rate of return of 25 to 40 percent per year by reducing the economic cost of illness in the US. It found that of the 21 drugs with the highest therapeutic impact on society introduced between 1965 and 1992, public funding was &quot;instrumental&quot; for 15. As of 2011, NIH-supported research helped to discover 153 new FDA-approved drugs, vaccines, and new indications for drugs in the 40 years prior. One study found NIH funding aided either directly or indirectly in developing the drugs or drug targets for all of the 210 FDA-approved drugs from 2010 to 2016. In 2015, Pierre Azoulay et al. estimated $10 million invested in research generated two to three new patents.

===Notable discoveries and developments===
Since its inception, the NIH intramural research program has been a source of many pivotal scientific and medical discoveries. Some of these include:
* 1908: George W. McCoy&#x27;s discovery that rodents were a reservoir of bubonic plague.
* 1911: George W. McCoy, Charles W. Chapin, William B. Wherry, and B. H. Lamb described the previously unknown tularemia.
* 1924: Roscoe R. Spencer and Ralph R. Parker developed a vaccine against Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
* 1930: Sanford M. Rosenthal developed a treatment for mercury poisoning used widely before the development of dimercaptoethanol.
* 1943: Wilton R. Earle pioneered the cell culture process and published a paper describing the production of malignancy in vitro, Katherine K. Sanford developed the first clone from an isolated cancer cell, and Virginia J. Evans devised a medium that supported growth of cells in vitro.
* 1940s–1950s: Bernard Horecker and colleagues described the pentose phosphate pathway.
* 1950s: Julius Axelrod discovered a new class of enzymes, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, a fundamental of drug metabolism.
* 1950: Earl Stadtman discovered phosphotransacetylose, elucidating the role of acetyl CoA in fatty acid metabolism.
* 1960s: Discovered the first human slow virus disease, kuru, which is a degenerative, fatal infection of the central nervous system. This discovery of a new mechanism for infectious diseases revolutionized thinking in microbiology and neurology.
* 1960s: Defined the mechanisms that regulate noradrenaline, one of the most important neurotransmitters in the brain.
* 1960s: Developed the first licensed rubella vaccine and the first test for rubella antibodies for large scale testing.
* 1960s: Developed an effective combination drug regimen for Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma.
* 1960s: Discovery that tooth decay is caused by bacteria.
* 1970s: Developed the assay for human chorionic gonadotropin that evolved into the home pregnancy tests.
* 1970s: Described the hormonal cycle involved in menstruation.
* 1980s: Determined the complete structure of the IgE receptor that is involved in allergic reactions.
* 1990s: Hari Reddi&#x27;s identification and purification of bone morphogenetic proteins
* 1990s: First trial of gene therapy in humans.

====NIH Toolbox====
In September 2006, the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research started a contract for the NIH Toolbox for the Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function to develop a set of state-of-the-art measurement tools to enhance collection of data in large cohort studies. Scientists from more than 100 institutions nationwide contributed. In September 2012, the NIH Toolbox was rolled out to the research community. NIH Toolbox assessments are based, where possible, on Item Response Theory and adapted for testing by computer.

====Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes====

NIH sponsors the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP), a repository of information produced by studies investigating the interaction of genotype and phenotype. The information includes phenotypes, molecular assay data, analyses and documents. Summary-level data is available to the general public whereas the individual-level data is accessible to researchers. According to the City Journal NIH denies access to such attributes as intelligence, education and health on the grounds that studying their genetic basis would be stigmatizing.

====Coronavirus vaccine====
The NIH partnered with Moderna in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic to develop a vaccine. The final phase of testing began on July 27 with up to 30,000 volunteers assigned to one of two groups—one receiving the mRNA-1273 vaccine and the other receiving salt water injections—and continued until there had been approximately 100 cases of COVID-19 among the participants. In 2021, the NIH contributed $4,395,399 towards the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) program.

====Collaboration with Wuhan Institute of Virology====

Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the NIH-funded EcoHealth Alliance has been the subject of controversy and increased scrutiny due to its ties to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV)—which has been at the center of speculation since early 2020 that SARS-CoV-2 may have escaped in a lab incident. Under political pressure, the NIH withdrew funding to EcoHealth Alliance in July 2020.

====NIH Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee====
On February 13, 2012, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced a new group of individuals assigned to research pain. This committee is composed of researchers from different organizations and will focus to &quot;coordinate pain research activities across the federal government with the goals of stimulating pain research collaboration… and providing an important avenue for public involvement&quot; (&quot;Members of new&quot;, 2012). With a committee such as this research will not be conducted by each individual organization or person but instead a collaborating group which will increase the information available. With this hopefully more pain management will be available including techniques for those with arthritis. In 2020 Beth Darnall, American scientist and pain psychologist, was appointed as scientific member of the group.

==Funding==
===Budget and politics===

To allocate funds, the NIH must first obtain its budget from Congress. This process begins with institute and center (IC) leaders collaborating with scientists to determine the most important and promising research areas within their fields. IC leaders discuss research areas with NIH management who then develops a budget request for continuing projects, new research proposals, and new initiatives from the Director. The NIH submits its budget request to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the HHS considers this request as a portion of its budget. Many adjustments and appeals occur between the NIH and HHS before the agency submits NIH&#x27;s budget request to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). OMB determines what amounts and research areas are approved for incorporation into the President&#x27;s final budget. The President then sends the NIH&#x27;s budget request to Congress in February for the next fiscal year&#x27;s allocations. The House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees deliberate and by fall, Congress usually appropriates funding. This process takes approximately 18 months before the NIH can allocate any actual funds.

When a government shutdown occurs, the NIH continues to treat people who are already enrolled in clinical trials, but does not start any new clinical trials and does not admit new patients who are not already enrolled in a clinical trial, except for the most critically ill, as determined by the NIH Director.

==== Historical funding ====
Over the last century, the responsibility to allocate funding has shifted from the OD and Advisory Committee to the individual ICs and Congress increasingly set apart funding for particular causes. In the 1970s, Congress began to earmark funds specifically for cancer research, and in the 1980s there was a significant amount allocated for AIDS/HIV research.

Funding for the NIH has often been a source of contention in Congress, serving as a proxy for the political currents of the time. During the 1980s, President Reagan repeatedly tried to cut funding for research, only to see Congress partly restore funding. The political contention over NIH funding slowed the nation&#x27;s response to the AIDS epidemic; while AIDS was reported in newspaper articles from 1981, no funding was provided for research on the disease. In 1984 National Cancer Institute scientists found implications that &quot;variants of a human cancer virus called HTLV-III are the primary cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS),&quot; a new epidemic that gripped the nation.

In 1992, the NIH encompassed nearly 1 percent of the federal government&#x27;s operating budget and controlled more than 50 percent of all funding for health research and 85 percent of all funding for health studies in universities. From 1993 to 2001 the NIH budget doubled. For a time, funding essentially remained flat, and for seven years following the financial crisis, the NIH budget struggled to keep up with inflation.

In 1999 Congress increased the NIH&#x27;s budget by $2.3 billion to $17.2 billion in 2000. In 2009 Congress again increased the NIH budget to $31 billion in 2010. In 2017 and 2018, Congress passed laws with bipartisan support that substantially increasing appropriations for the NIH, which was 37.3 billion dollars annually in FY2018.

===Extramural research===

Researchers at universities or other institutions outside of the NIH can apply for research project grants (RPGs) from the NIH. There are numerous funding mechanisms for different project types (e.g., basic research, clinical research, etc.) and career stages (e.g., early career, postdoc fellowships, etc.). The NIH regularly issues &quot;requests for applications&quot; (RFAs), e.g., on specific programmatic priorities or timely medical problems (such as Zika virus research in early 2016). In addition, researchers can apply for &quot;investigator-initiated grants&quot; whose subject is determined by the scientist.

The total number of applicants has increased substantially, from about 60,000 investigators who had applied during the period from 1999 to 2003 to slightly less than 90,000 in who had applied during the period from 2011 to 2015. Due to this, the &quot;cumulative investigator rate&quot;, that is, the likelihood that unique investigators are funded over a 5-year window, has declined from 43% to 31%.

R01 grants are the most common funding mechanism and include investigator-initiated projects. The roughly 27,000 to 29,000 R01 applications had a funding success of 17-19% during 2012 though 2014. Similarly, the 13,000 to 14,000 R21 applications had a funding success of 13-14% during the same period. In FY 2016, the total number of grant applications received by the NIH was 54,220, with approximately 19% being awarded funding. Institutes have varying funding rates. The National Cancer Institute awarded funding to 12% of applicants, while the National Institute for General Medical Science awarded funding to 30% of applicants.

===Funding criteria===
The NIH employs five broad decision criteria in its funding policy. First, ensure the highest quality of scientific research by employing an arduous peer review process. Second, seize opportunities that have the greatest potential to yield new knowledge and that will lead to better prevention and treatment of disease. Third, maintain a diverse research portfolio to capitalize on major discoveries in a variety of fields such as cell biology, genetics, physics, engineering, and computer science. Fourth, address public health needs according to the disease burden (e.g., prevalence and mortality). And fifth, construct and support the scientific infrastructure (e.g., well-equipped laboratories and safe research facilities) necessary to conduct research.

Advisory committee members advise the institute on policy and procedures affecting the external research programs and provide a second level of review for all grant and cooperative agreement applications considered by the Institute for funding.

====Gender and sex bias====
In 2014, it was announced that the NIH is directing scientists to perform their experiments with both female and male animals, or cells derived from females as well as males if they are studying cell cultures, and that the NIH would take the balance of each study design into consideration when awarding grants. The announcement also stated that this rule would probably not apply when studying sex-specific diseases (for example, ovarian or testicular cancer).

===Stakeholders===
====General public====
One of the goals of the NIH is to &quot;expand the base in medical and associated sciences in order to ensure a continued high return on the public investment in research.&quot; Taxpayer dollars funding the NIH are from the taxpayers, making them the primary beneficiaries of advances in research. Thus, the general public is a key stakeholder in the decisions resulting from the NIH funding policy. However, some in the general public do not feel their interests are being represented, and individuals have formed patient advocacy groups to represent their own interests.

====Extramural researchers and scientists====
Important stakeholders of the NIH funding policy include researchers and scientists. Extramural researchers differ from intramural researchers in that they are not employed by the NIH but may apply for funding. Throughout the history of the NIH, the amount of funding received has increased, but the proportion to each IC remains relatively constant. The individual ICs then decide who will receive the grant money and how much will be allotted.

Policy changes on who receives funding significantly affect researchers. For example, the NIH has recently attempted to approve more first-time NIH R01 applicants or the research grant applications of young scientists. To encourage the participation of young scientists, the application process has been shortened and made easier. In addition, first-time applicants are being offered more funding for their research grants than those who have received grants in the past.

==Commercial partnerships==
In 2011 and 2012, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General published a series of audit reports revealing that throughout the fiscal years 2000–2010, institutes under the aegis of the NIH did not comply with the time and amount requirements specified in appropriations statutes, in awarding federal contracts to commercial partners, committing the federal government to tens of millions of dollars of expenditure ahead of appropriation of funds from Congress.

==Institutes and centers==

The NIH is composed of 27 separate institutes and centers that conduct and coordinate biomedical research. These are:
* National Cancer Institute (NCI)
* National Eye Institute (NEI)
* National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)
* National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)
* National Institute on Aging (NIA)
* National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)
* National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)
* National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)
* National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB)
* National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)
* National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)
* National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)
* National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)
* National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)
* National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)
* National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)
* National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)
* National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD)
* National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)

* Fogarty International Center (FIC)
* National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)
* National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)
* NIH Clinical Center (NIH CC)
In addition, the National Center for Research Resources operated from April 13, 1962, to December 23, 2011.

==ARPA-H==

The Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) is an entity formerly within the Office of the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, which was created by Congress in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022. Modeled after DARPA, HSARPA, IARPA, and ARPA-E, it is intended to pursue unconventional research projects through methods not typically used by federal agencies or private sector companies. Secretary Xavier Becerra delegated ARPA-H to the NIH on May 24, 2022. It received $1 billion in appropriations in 2022, and $1.5 billion in 2023, and it is requesting $2.5 billion for 2024.

==Consensus Development Program==
The Consensus Development Program is an initiative focused on gathering expert opinions to establish standards and guidelines in various fields, especially in health and medicine. Developed as a collaborative effort by organizations such as the NIH, the program assembles panels of specialists who assess available evidence on critical topics and form recommendations to guide clinical practice and policy. This method helps ensure that healthcare decisions are informed by the latest scientific research and expert consensus.

<doc id="46177" wikidata="Q1290616" url="?curid=46177" title="Epidemic typhus">
<text>Epidemic typhus, also known as louse-borne typhus, is a form of typhus so named because the disease often causes epidemics following wars and natural disasters where civil life is disrupted. Epidemic typhus is spread to people through contact with infected body lice, in contrast to endemic typhus which is usually transmitted by fleas.

Though typhus has been responsible for millions of deaths throughout history, it is still considered a rare disease that occurs mainly in populations that suffer unhygienic extreme overcrowding. Typhus is most rare in industrialized countries. It occurs primarily in the colder, mountainous regions of central and east Africa, as well as Central and South America. The causative organism is &quot;Rickettsia prowazekii&quot;, transmitted by the human body louse (&quot;Pediculus humanus corporis&quot;). Untreated typhus cases have a fatality rate of approximately 40%.

Epidemic typhus should not be confused with murine typhus, which is more endemic to the United States, particularly Southern California and Texas. This form of typhus has similar symptoms but is caused by &quot;Rickettsia typhi&quot;, is less deadly, and has different vectors for transmission.

==Signs and symptoms==

Symptoms of this disease typically begin within 2 weeks of contact with the causative organism. Signs/Symptoms may include:
* Fever
* Chills
* Headache
* Confusion
* Cough
* Rapid Breathing
* Body/Muscle Aches
* Rash
* Nausea
* Vomiting

After 5–6 days, a macular skin eruption develops: first on the upper trunk and spreading to the rest of the body (rarely to the face, palms, or soles of the feet, however).

Brill–Zinsser disease, first described by Nathan Brill in 1913 at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, is a mild form of epidemic typhus that recurs in someone after a long period of latency (similar to the relationship between chickenpox and shingles). This recurrence often arises in times of relative immunosuppression, which is often in the context of a person suffering malnutrition or other illnesses. In combination with poor sanitation and hygiene in times of social chaos and upheaval, which enable a greater density of lice, this reactivation is why typhus generates epidemics in such conditions.

=== Complications ===
Complications are as follows
* Myocarditis
* Endocarditis
* Mycotic aneurysm
* Pneumonia
* Pancreatitis
* Kidney or bladder infections
* Acute renal failure
* Meningitis
* Encephalitis
* Myelitis
* Septic shock

==Transmission==

Feeding on a human who carries the bacterium infects the louse. &quot;R. prowazekii&quot; grows in the louse&#x27;s gut and is excreted in its feces. The louse transmits the disease by biting an uninfected human, who scratches the louse bite (which itches) and rubs the feces into the wound. The incubation period is one to two weeks. &quot;R. prowazekii&quot; can remain viable and virulent in the dried louse feces for many days. Typhus will eventually kill the louse, though the disease will remain viable for many weeks in the dead louse.

Epidemic typhus has historically occurred during times of war and deprivation. For example, typhus killed millions of prisoners in German Nazi concentration camps during World War II. The unhygenic conditions in camps such as Auschwitz, Theresienstadt, and Bergen-Belsen allowed diseases such as typhus to flourish. Situations in the twenty-first century with potential for a typhus epidemic would include refugee camps during a major famine or natural disaster. In the periods between outbreaks, when human to human transmission occurs less often, the flying squirrel serves as a zoonotic reservoir for the &quot;Rickettsia prowazekii&quot; bacterium.

In 1916, Henrique da Rocha Lima proved that the bacterium &quot;Rickettsia prowazekii&quot; was the agent responsible for typhus. He named it after his colleague Stanislaus von Prowazek, who had along with himself become infected with typhus while investigating an outbreak, subsequently dying, and H. T. Ricketts, another zoologist who had died from typhus while investigating it. Once these crucial facts were recognized, Rudolf Weigl in 1930 was able to fashion a practical and effective vaccine production method. He ground up the insides of infected lice that had been drinking blood. It was, however, very dangerous to produce, and carried a high likelihood of infection to those who were working on it.

A safer mass-production-ready method using egg yolks was developed by Herald R. Cox in 1938. This vaccine was widely available and used extensively by 1943.

==Diagnosis==
IFA, ELISA or PCR positive after 10 days.

==Treatment==
The infection is treated with antibiotics. Intravenous fluids and oxygen may be needed to stabilize the patient. There is a significant disparity between the untreated mortality and treated mortality rates: 10-60% untreated versus close to 0% treated with antibiotics within 8 days of initial infection. Tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and doxycycline are commonly used.

Some of the simplest methods of prevention and treatment focus on preventing infestation of body lice. Completely changing the clothing, washing the infested clothing in hot water, and in some cases also treating recently used bedsheets all help to prevent typhus by removing potentially infected lice. Clothes left unworn and unwashed for 7 days also result in the death of both lice and their eggs, as they have no access to a human host. Another form of lice prevention requires dusting infested clothing with a powder consisting of 10% DDT, 1% malathion, or 1% permethrin, which kill lice and their eggs.

Other preventive measures for individuals are to avoid unhygienic, extremely overcrowded areas where the causative organisms can jump from person to person. In addition, they are warned to keep a distance from larger rodents that carry lice, such as rats, squirrels, or opossums.

==History==

=== History of outbreaks ===

==== Before 19th century ====
During the second year of the Peloponnesian War (430 BC), the city-state of Athens in ancient Greece had an epidemic, known as the Plague of Athens, which killed, among others, Pericles and his two elder sons. The plague returned twice more, in 429 BC and in the winter of 427/6 BC. Epidemic typhus is proposed as a strong candidate for the cause of this disease outbreak, supported by both medical and scholarly opinions.
The first description of typhus was probably given in 1083 at La Cava abbey near Salerno, Italy. In 1546, Girolamo Fracastoro, a Florentine physician, described typhus in his famous treatise on viruses and contagion, &quot;De Contagione et Contagiosis Morbis&quot;.

Typhus was carried to mainland Europe by soldiers who had been fighting on Cyprus. The first reliable description of the disease appears during the siege of the Emirate of Granada by the Catholic Monarchs in 1489 during the Granada War. These accounts include descriptions of fever and red spots over arms, back and chest, progressing to delirium, gangrenous sores, and the stench of rotting flesh. During the siege, the Catholics lost 3,000 men to enemy action, but an additional 17,000 died of typhus.

Typhus was also common in prisons (and in crowded conditions where lice spread easily), where it was known as &quot;Gaol fever&quot; or &quot;Jail fever&quot;. Gaol fever often occurs when prisoners are frequently huddled together in dark, filthy rooms. Imprisonment until the next term of court was often equivalent to a death sentence. Typhus was so infectious that prisoners brought before the court sometimes infected the court itself. Following the Black Assize of Oxford 1577, over 510 died from epidemic typhus, including Speaker Robert Bell, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer. The outbreak that followed, between 1577 and 1579, killed about 10% of the English population. 

During the Lent assize held at Taunton (1730), typhus caused the death of the Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, the High Sheriff of Somerset, the sergeant, and hundreds of other persons. During a time when there were 241 capital offences, more prisoners died from &#x27;gaol fever&#x27; than were put to death by all the public executioners in the realm. In 1759 an English authority estimated that each year a quarter of the prisoners had died from gaol fever. In London, typhus frequently broke out among the ill-kept prisoners of Newgate Gaol and moved into the general city population.

==== 19th century ====
Epidemics occurred in the British Isles and throughout Europe, for instance, during the English Civil War, the Thirty Years&#x27; War, and the Napoleonic Wars. Many historians believe that the typhus outbreak among Napoleon&#x27;s troops is the real reason why he stalled his military campaign into Russia, rather than starvation or the cold. A major epidemic occurred in Ireland between 1816 and 1819, and again in the late 1830s. Another major typhus epidemic occurred during the Great Irish Famine between 1846 and 1849. The Irish typhus spread to England, where it was sometimes called &quot;Irish fever&quot; and was noted for its virulence. It killed people of all social classes since lice were endemic and inescapable, but it hit particularly hard in the lower or &quot;unwashed&quot; social strata. It was carried to North America by the many Irish refugees who fled the famine. In Canada, the 1847 North American typhus epidemic killed more than 20,000 people, mainly Irish immigrants in fever sheds and other forms of quarantine, who had contracted the disease aboard coffin ships. As many as 900,000 deaths have been attributed to the typhus fever during the Crimean War in 1853–1856, and 270,000 to the 1866 Finnish typhus epidemic.

In the United States, a typhus epidemic struck Philadelphia in 1837. The son of Franklin Pierce died in 1843 of a typhus epidemic in Concord, New Hampshire. Several epidemics occurred in Baltimore, Memphis, and Washington, D.C. between 1865 and 1873. Typhus fever was also a significant killer during the American Civil War, although typhoid fever was the more prevalent cause of US Civil War &quot;camp fever.&quot; Typhoid is a completely different disease from typhus. Typically more men died on both sides of disease than wounds.

Rudolph Carl Virchow, a physician, anthropologist, and historian attempted to control an outbreak of typhus in Upper Silesia and wrote a 190-page report about it. He concluded that the solution to the outbreak did not lie in individual treatment or by providing small changes in housing, food or clothing, but rather in widespread structural changes to directly address the issue of poverty. Virchow&#x27;s experience in Upper Silesia led to his observation that &quot;Medicine is a social science&quot;. His report led to changes in German public health policy.

==== 20th century ====
Typhus was endemic in Poland and several neighboring countries prior to World War I (1914–1918). During and shortly after the war, epidemic typhus caused up to three million deaths in Russia, and several million citizens also died in Poland and Romania. Since 1914, many troops, prisoners and even doctors were infected, and at least 150,000 died from typhus in Serbia, 50,000 of whom were prisoners. Delousing stations were established for troops on the Western Front, but the disease ravaged the armies of the Eastern Front. Fatalities were generally between 10 and 40 percent of those infected, and the disease was a major cause of death for those nursing the sick. During World War I and the Russian Civil War between the White and Red, the typhus epidemic caused 2–3 million deaths out of 20–30 million cases in Russia between 1918 and 1922.

Typhus caused hundreds of thousands of deaths during World War II. It struck the German Army during Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of Russia, in 1941. In 1942 and 1943 typhus hit French North Africa, Egypt and Iran particularly hard. Typhus epidemics killed inmates in the Nazi concentration camps and death camps such as Auschwitz, Dachau, Theresienstadt, and Bergen-Belsen. Footage shot at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp shows the mass graves for typhus victims. Anne Frank, at age 15, and her sister Margot both died of typhus in the camps. Even larger epidemics in the post-war chaos of Europe were averted only by the widespread use of the newly discovered DDT to kill lice on the millions of refugees and displaced persons.

Following the development of a vaccine during World War II, Western Europe and North America have been able to prevent epidemics. These have usually occurred in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Africa, particularly Ethiopia. Naval Medical Research Unit Five worked there with the government on research to attempt to eradicate the disease.

In one of its first major outbreaks since World War II, epidemic typhus reemerged in 1995 in a jail in N&#x27;Gozi, Burundi. This outbreak followed the start of the Burundian Civil War in 1993, which caused the displacement of 760,000 people. Refugee camps were crowded and unsanitary, and often far from towns and medical services.

==== 21st century ====
A 2005 study found seroprevalence of &quot;R. prowazekii&quot; antibodies in homeless populations in two shelters in Marseille, France. The study noted the &quot;hallmarks of epidemic typhus and relapsing fever&quot;.

=== History of vaccines ===

Major developments for typhus vaccines started during World War I, as typhus caused high mortality, and threatened the health and readiness for soldiers on the battlefield. Vaccines for typhus, like other vaccines of the time, were classified as either living or killed vaccines. Live vaccines were typically an injection of live agent, and killed vaccines are live cultures of an agent that are chemically inactivated prior to use.

Attempts to create a living vaccine of classical, louse-borne, typhus were attempted by French researchers but these proved unsuccessful. Researchers turned to murine typhus to develop a live vaccine. At the time, murine vaccine was viewed as a less severe alternative to classical typhus. Four versions of a live vaccine cultivated from murine typhus were tested, on a large scale, in 1934.

While the French were making advancements with live vaccines, other European countries were working to develop killed vaccines. During World War II, there were three kinds of potentially useful killed vaccines. All three killed vaccines relied on the cultivation of &quot;Rickettsia prowazekii&quot;, the organism responsible for typhus. The first attempt at a killed vaccine was developed by Germany, using the &quot;Rickettsia prowazekii&quot; found in louse feces. The vaccine was tested extensively in Poland between the two world wars and used by the Germans for their troops during their attacks on the Soviet Union.

A second method of growing &quot;Rickettsia prowazekii&quot; was discovered using the yolk sac of chick embryos. Germans tried several times to use this technique of growing &quot;Rickettsia prowazekii&quot; but no effort was pushed very far.

The last technique was an extended development of the previously known method of growing murine typhus in rodents. It was discovered that rabbits could be infected, by a similar process, and contract classical typhus instead of murine typhus. Again, while proven to produce suitable &quot;Rickettsia prowazekii&quot; for vaccine development, this method was not used to produce wartime vaccines.

During WWII, the two major vaccines available were the killed vaccine grown in lice and the live vaccine from France. Neither was used much during the war. The killed, louse-grown vaccine was difficult to manufacture in large enough quantities, and the French vaccine was not believed to be safe enough for use.

The Germans worked to develop their own live vaccine from the urine of typhus victims. While developing a live vaccine, Germany used live &quot;Rickettsia prowazekii&quot; to test multiple possible vaccines&#x27; capabilities. They gave live &quot;Rickettsia prowazekii&quot; to concentration camp prisoners, using them as a control group for the vaccine tests.

The use of DDT as an effective means of killing lice, the main carrier of typhus, was discovered in Naples.

==Society and culture==

===Biological weapon===
Typhus was one of more than a dozen agents that the United States researched as potential biological weapons before President Richard Nixon suspended all non-defensive aspects of the U.S. biological weapons program in 1969.

=== Poverty and displacement ===
The CDC lists the following areas as active foci of human epidemic typhus: Andean regions of South America, some parts of Africa; on the other hand, the CDC only recognizes an active enzootic cycle in the United States involving flying squirrels (CDC). Though epidemic typhus is commonly thought to be restricted to areas of the developing world, serological examination of homeless persons in Houston found evidence for exposure to the bacterial pathogens that cause epidemic typhus and murine typhus. A study involving 930 homeless people in Marseille, France, found high rates of seroprevalence to &quot;R. prowazekii&quot; and a high prevalence of louse-borne infections in the homeless.

Typhus has been increasingly discovered in homeless populations in developed nations. Typhus among homeless populations is especially prevalent as these populations tend to migrate across states and countries, spreading the risk of infection with their movement. The same risk applies to refugees, who travel across country lines, often living in close proximity and unable to maintain necessary hygienic standards to avoid being at risk for catching lice possibly infected with typhus.

Because the typhus-infected lice live in clothing, the prevalence of typhus is also affected by weather, humidity, poverty and lack of hygiene. Lice, and therefore typhus, are more prevalent during colder months, especially winter and early spring. In these seasons, people tend to wear multiple layers of clothing, giving lice more places to go unnoticed by their hosts. This is particularly a problem for poverty-stricken populations as they often do not have multiple sets of clothing, preventing them from practicing good hygiene habits that could prevent louse infestation.

Due to fear of an outbreak of epidemic typhus, the US Government put a typhus quarantine in place in 1917 across the entirety of the US-Mexican border. Sanitation plants were constructed that required immigrants to be thoroughly inspected and bathed before crossing the border. Those who routinely crossed back and forth across the border for work were required to go through the sanitation process weekly, updating their quarantine card with the date of the next week&#x27;s sanitation. These sanitation border stations remained active over the next two decades, regardless of the disappearance of the typhus threat. This fear of typhus and resulting quarantine and sanitation protocols dramatically hardened the border between the US and Mexico, fostering scientific and popular prejudices against Mexicans. This ultimately intensified racial tensions and fueled efforts to ban immigrants to the US from the Southern Hemisphere because the immigrants were associated with the disease.

<text>A SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) is a very sensitive magnetometer used to measure extremely weak magnetic fields, based on superconducting loops containing Josephson junctions.

SQUIDs are sensitive enough to measure fields as low as 5×10−18 T with a few days of averaged measurements. Their noise levels are as low as 3 fT·Hz−. For comparison, a typical refrigerator magnet produces 0.01 tesla (10−2 T), and some processes in animals produce very small magnetic fields between 10−9 T and 10−6 T. SERF atomic magnetometers, invented in the early 2000s are potentially more sensitive and do not require cryogenic refrigeration but are orders of magnitude larger in size (~1 cm3) and must be operated in a near-zero magnetic field.

== History and design ==

There are two main types of SQUID: direct current (DC) and radio frequency (RF). RF SQUIDs can work with only one Josephson junction (superconducting tunnel junction), which might make them cheaper to produce, but are less sensitive.

=== DC SQUID ===

The DC SQUID was invented in 1964 by Robert Jaklevic, John J. Lambe, James Mercereau, and Arnold Silver of Ford Research Labs after Brian Josephson postulated the Josephson effect in 1962, and the first Josephson junction was made by John Rowell and Philip Anderson at Bell Labs in 1963. It has two Josephson junctions in parallel in a superconducting loop. It is based on the DC Josephson effect. In the absence of any external magnetic field, the input current formula_1 splits into the two branches equally. If a small external magnetic field is applied to the superconducting loop, a screening current, formula_2, begins to circulate the loop that generates the magnetic field canceling the applied external flux, and creates an additional Josephson phase which is proportional to this external magnetic flux. The induced current is in the same direction as formula_1 in one of the branches of the superconducting loop, and is opposite to formula_1 in the other branch; the total current becomes formula_5 in one branch and formula_6 in the other. As soon as the current in either branch exceeds the critical current, formula_7, of the Josephson junction, a voltage appears across the junction.

Now suppose the external flux is further increased until it exceeds formula_8, half the magnetic flux quantum. Since the flux enclosed by the superconducting loop must be an integer number of flux quanta, instead of screening the flux the SQUID now energetically prefers to increase it to formula_9. The current now flows in the opposite direction, opposing the difference between the admitted flux formula_9 and the external field of just over formula_8. The current decreases as the external field is increased, is zero when the flux is exactly formula_9, and again reverses direction as the external field is further increased. Thus, the current changes direction periodically, every time the flux increases by additional half-integer multiple of formula_9, with a change at maximum amperage every half-plus-integer multiple of formula_9 and at zero amps every integer multiple.

If the input current is more than formula_7, then the SQUID always operates in the resistive mode. The voltage, in this case, is thus a function of the applied magnetic field and the period equal to formula_9. Since the current-voltage characteristic of the DC SQUID is hysteretic, a shunt resistance, formula_17 is connected across the junction to eliminate the hysteresis (in the case of copper oxide based high-temperature superconductors the junction&#x27;s own intrinsic resistance is usually sufficient). The screening current is the applied flux divided by the self-inductance of the ring. Thus formula_18 can be estimated as the function of formula_19 (flux to voltage converter) as follows:

:formula_20

:formula_21, where formula_22 is the self inductance of the superconducting ring

:formula_23

The discussion in this section assumed perfect flux quantization in the loop. However, this is only true for big loops with a large self-inductance. According to the relations, given above, this implies also small current and voltage variations. In practice the self-inductance formula_22 of the loop is not so large. The general case can be evaluated by introducing a parameter

:formula_25

where formula_26 is the critical current of the SQUID. Usually formula_27 is of order one.

=== RF SQUID ===
The RF SQUID was invented in 1967 by Robert Jaklevic, John J. Lambe, Arnold Silver, and James Edward Zimmerman at Ford. It is based on the AC Josephson effect and uses only one Josephson junction. It is less sensitive compared to DC SQUID but is cheaper and easier to manufacture in smaller quantities. Most fundamental measurements in biomagnetism, even of extremely small signals, have been made using RF SQUIDS.
The RF SQUID is inductively coupled to a resonant tank circuit. Depending on the external magnetic field, as the SQUID operates in the resistive mode, the effective inductance of the tank circuit changes, thus changing the resonant frequency of the tank circuit. These frequency measurements can be easily taken, and thus the losses which appear as the voltage across the load resistor in the circuit are a periodic function of the applied magnetic flux with a period of formula_9. For a precise mathematical description refer to the original paper by Erné et al.

=== Materials used ===
The traditional superconducting materials for SQUIDs are pure niobium or a lead alloy with 10% gold or indium, as pure lead is unstable when its temperature is repeatedly changed. To maintain superconductivity, the entire device needs to operate within a few degrees of absolute zero, cooled with liquid helium.

High-temperature SQUID sensors were developed in the late 1980s. They are made of high-temperature superconductors, particularly YBCO, and are cooled by liquid nitrogen which is cheaper and more easily handled than liquid helium. They are less sensitive than conventional low temperature SQUIDs but good enough for many applications.

In 2006, A proof of concept was shown for CNT-SQUID sensors built with an aluminium loop and a single walled carbon nanotube Josephson junction. The sensors are a few 100 nm in size and operate at 1K or below. Such sensors allow to count spins.

In 2022 a SQUID was constructed on magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG)

== Uses ==
The extreme sensitivity of SQUIDs makes them ideal for studies in biology. Magnetoencephalography (MEG), for example, uses measurements from an array of SQUIDs to make inferences about neural activity inside brains. Because SQUIDs can operate at acquisition rates much higher than the highest temporal frequency of interest in the signals emitted by the brain (kHz), MEG achieves good temporal resolution. Another area where SQUIDs are used is magnetogastrography, which is concerned with recording the weak magnetic fields of the stomach. A novel application of SQUIDs is the magnetic marker monitoring method, which is used to trace the path of orally applied drugs. In the clinical environment SQUIDs are used in cardiology for magnetic field imaging (MFI), which detects the magnetic field of the heart for diagnosis and risk stratification.

Probably the most common commercial use of SQUIDs is in magnetic property measurement systems (MPMS). These are turn-key systems, made by several manufacturers, that measure the magnetic properties of a material sample which typically has a temperature between 300 mK and 400 K. With the decreasing size of SQUID sensors since the last decade, such sensor can equip the tip of an AFM probe. Such device allows simultaneous measurement of roughness of the surface of a sample and the local magnetic flux.

For example, SQUIDs are being used as detectors to perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While high-field MRI uses precession fields of one to several teslas, SQUID-detected MRI uses measurement fields that lie in the microtesla range. In a conventional MRI system, the signal scales as the square of the measurement frequency (and hence precession field): one power of frequency comes from the thermal polarization of the spins at ambient temperature, while the second power of field comes from the fact that the induced voltage in the pickup coil is proportional to the frequency of the precessing magnetization. In the case of untuned SQUID detection of prepolarized spins, however, the NMR signal strength is independent of precession field, allowing MRI signal detection in extremely weak fields, on the order of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. SQUID-detected MRI has advantages over high-field MRI systems, such as the low cost required to build such a system, and its compactness. The principle has been demonstrated by imaging human extremities, and its future application may include tumor screening.

Another application is the scanning SQUID microscope, which uses a SQUID immersed in liquid helium as the probe. The use of SQUIDs in oil prospecting, mineral exploration, earthquake prediction and geothermal energy surveying is becoming more widespread as superconductor technology develops; they are also used as precision movement sensors in a variety of scientific applications, such as the detection of gravitational waves.
A SQUID is the sensor in each of the four gyroscopes employed on Gravity Probe B in order to test the limits of the theory of general relativity.

A modified RF SQUID was used to observe the dynamical Casimir effect for the first time.

SQUIDs constructed from super-cooled niobium wire loops are used as the basis for D-Wave Systems 2000Q quantum computer.

===Transition-edge sensors===
One of the largest uses of SQUIDs is to read out superconducting Transition-edge sensors. Hundreds of thousands of multiplexed SQUIDs coupled to transition-edge sensors are presently being deployed to study the Cosmic microwave background, for X-ray astronomy, to search for dark matter made up of Weakly interacting massive particles, and for spectroscopy at Synchrotron light sources.

===Cold dark matter===
Advanced SQUIDS called near quantum-limited SQUID amplifiers form the basis of the Axion Dark Matter Experiment (ADMX) at the University of Washington. Axions are a prime candidate for cold dark matter.

===Proposed uses===
A potential military application exists for use in anti-submarine warfare as a magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) fitted to maritime patrol aircraft.

SQUIDs are used in superparamagnetic relaxometry (SPMR), a technology that utilizes the high magnetic field sensitivity of SQUID sensors and the superparamagnetic properties of magnetite nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are paramagnetic; they have no magnetic moment until exposed to an external field where they become ferromagnetic. After removal of the magnetizing field, the nanoparticles decay from a ferromagnetic state to a paramagnetic state, with a time constant that depends upon the particle size and whether they are bound to an external surface. Measurement of the decaying magnetic field by SQUID sensors is used to detect and localize the nanoparticles. Applications for SPMR may include cancer detection.

<doc id="46182" wikidata="Q381287" url="?curid=46182" title="White noise">
<text>In signal processing, white noise is a random signal having equal intensity at different frequencies, giving it a constant power spectral density. The term is used with this or similar meanings in many scientific and technical disciplines, including physics, acoustical engineering, telecommunications, and statistical forecasting. White noise refers to a statistical model for signals and signal sources, not to any specific signal. White noise draws its name from white light, although light that appears white generally does not have a flat power spectral density over the visible band.
In discrete time, white noise is a discrete signal whose samples are regarded as a sequence of serially uncorrelated random variables with zero mean and finite variance; a single realization of white noise is a random shock. In some contexts, it is also required that the samples be independent and have identical probability distribution (in other words independent and identically distributed random variables are the simplest representation of white noise). In particular, if each sample has a normal distribution with zero mean, the signal is said to be additive white Gaussian noise.

The samples of a white noise signal may be sequential in time, or arranged along one or more spatial dimensions. In digital image processing, the pixels of a white noise image are typically arranged in a rectangular grid, and are assumed to be independent random variables with uniform probability distribution over some interval. The concept can be defined also for signals spread over more complicated domains, such as a sphere or a torus.
An  is a purely theoretical construction. The bandwidth of white noise is limited in practice by the mechanism of noise generation, by the transmission medium and by finite observation capabilities. Thus, random signals are considered white noise if they are observed to have a flat spectrum over the range of frequencies that are relevant to the context. For an audio signal, the relevant range is the band of audible sound frequencies (between 20 and 20,000 Hz). Such a signal is heard by the human ear as a hissing sound, resembling the /h/ sound in a sustained aspiration. On the other hand, the &quot;sh&quot; sound in &quot;ash&quot; is a colored noise because it has a formant structure. In music and acoustics, the term &quot;white noise&quot; may be used for any signal that has a similar hissing sound.

In the context of phylogenetically based statistical methods, the term &quot;white noise&quot; can refer to a lack of phylogenetic pattern in comparative data. In nontechnical contexts, it is sometimes used to mean &quot;random talk without meaningful contents&quot;.

==Statistical properties==
Any distribution of values is possible (although it must have zero DC component). Even a binary signal which can only take on the values 1 or -1 will be white if the sequence is statistically uncorrelated. Noise having a continuous distribution, such as a normal distribution, can of course be white.

It is often incorrectly assumed that Gaussian noise (i.e., noise with a Gaussian amplitude distributionsee normal distribution) necessarily refers to white noise, yet neither property implies the other. Gaussianity refers to the probability distribution with respect to the value, in this context the probability of the signal falling within any particular range of amplitudes, while the term &#x27;white&#x27; refers to the way the signal power is distributed (i.e., independently) over time or among frequencies.

One form of white noise is the generalized mean-square derivative of the Wiener process or Brownian motion.

A generalization to random elements on infinite dimensional spaces, such as random fields, is the white noise measure.

==Practical applications==
===Music===
White noise is commonly used in the production of electronic music, usually either directly or as an input for a filter to create other types of noise signal. It is used extensively in audio synthesis, typically to recreate percussive instruments such as cymbals or snare drums which have high noise content in their frequency domain. A simple example of white noise is a nonexistent radio station (static).

===Electronics engineering===
White noise is also used to obtain the impulse response of an electrical circuit, in particular of amplifiers and other audio equipment. It is not used for testing loudspeakers as its spectrum contains too great an amount of high-frequency content. Pink noise, which differs from white noise in that it has equal energy in each octave, is used for testing transducers such as loudspeakers and microphones.

===Computing===
White noise is used as the basis of some random number generators. For example, Random.org uses a system of atmospheric antennas to generate random digit patterns from sources that can be well-modeled by white noise.

===Tinnitus treatment===
White noise is a common synthetic noise source used for sound masking by a tinnitus masker. White noise machines and other white noise sources are sold as privacy enhancers and sleep aids (see music and sleep) and to mask tinnitus. The Marpac Sleep-Mate was the first domestic use white noise machine built in 1962 by traveling salesman Jim Buckwalter. Alternatively, the use of an AM radio tuned to unused frequencies (&quot;static&quot;) is a simpler and more cost-effective source of white noise. However, white noise generated from a common commercial radio receiver tuned to an unused frequency is extremely vulnerable to being contaminated with spurious signals, such as adjacent radio stations, harmonics from non-adjacent radio stations, electrical equipment in the vicinity of the receiving antenna causing interference, or even atmospheric events such as solar flares and especially lightning.

===Work environment===
The effects of white noise upon cognitive function are mixed. Recently, a small study found that white noise background stimulation improves cognitive functioning among secondary students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), while decreasing performance of non-ADHD students. Other work indicates it is effective in improving the mood and performance of workers by masking background office noise, but decreases cognitive performance in complex card sorting tasks.

Similarly, an experiment was carried out on sixty-six healthy participants to observe the benefits of using white noise in a learning environment. The experiment involved the participants identifying different images whilst having different sounds in the background. Overall the experiment showed that white noise does in fact have benefits in relation to learning. The experiments showed that white noise improved the participants&#x27; learning abilities and their recognition memory slightly.

==Mathematical definitions==

===White noise vector===
A random vector (that is, a random variable with values in &quot;Rn&quot;) is said to be a white noise vector or white random vector if its components each have a probability distribution with zero mean and finite variance, and are statistically independent: that is, their joint probability distribution must be the product of the distributions of the individual components.

A necessary (but, in general, not sufficient) condition for statistical independence of two variables is that they be statistically uncorrelated; that is, their covariance is zero. Therefore, the covariance matrix &quot;R&quot; of the components of a white noise vector &quot;w&quot; with &quot;n&quot; elements must be an &quot;n&quot; by &quot;n&quot; diagonal matrix, where each diagonal element &quot;Rii&quot; is the variance of component &quot;wi&quot;; and the correlation matrix must be the &quot;n&quot; by &quot;n&quot; identity matrix.

If, in addition to being independent, every variable in &quot;w&quot; also has a normal distribution with zero mean and the same variance formula_1, &quot;w&quot; is said to be a Gaussian white noise vector. In that case, the joint distribution of &quot;w&quot; is a multivariate normal distribution; the independence between the variables then implies that the distribution has spherical symmetry in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space. Therefore, any orthogonal transformation of the vector will result in a Gaussian white random vector. In particular, under most types of discrete Fourier transform, such as FFT and Hartley, the transform &quot;W&quot; of &quot;w&quot; will be a Gaussian white noise vector, too; that is, the &quot;n&quot; Fourier coefficients of &quot;w&quot; will be independent Gaussian variables with zero mean and the same variance formula_1.

The power spectrum &quot;P&quot; of a random vector &quot;w&quot; can be defined as the expected value of the squared modulus of each coefficient of its Fourier transform &quot;W&quot;, that is, &quot;Pi&quot; = E(|&quot;Wi&quot;|2). Under that definition, a Gaussian white noise vector will have a perfectly flat power spectrum, with &quot;Pi&quot; = &quot;σ&quot;2 for all &quot;i&quot;.

If &quot;w&quot; is a white random vector, but not a Gaussian one, its Fourier coefficients &quot;Wi&quot; will not be completely independent of each other; although for large &quot;n&quot; and common probability distributions the dependencies are very subtle, and their pairwise correlations can be assumed to be zero.

Often the weaker condition statistically uncorrelated is used in the definition of white noise, instead of statistically independent. However, some of the commonly expected properties of white noise (such as flat power spectrum) may not hold for this weaker version. Under this assumption, the stricter version can be referred to explicitly as independent white noise vector. Other authors use strongly white and weakly white instead.

An example of a random vector that is Gaussian white noise in the weak but not in the strong sense is formula_3 where formula_4 is a normal random variable with zero mean, and formula_5 is equal to formula_6 or to formula_7, with equal probability. These two variables are uncorrelated and individually normally distributed, but they are not jointly normally distributed and are not independent. If formula_8 is rotated by 45 degrees, its two components will still be uncorrelated, but their distribution will no longer be normal.

In some situations, one may relax the definition by allowing each component of a white random vector formula_9 to have non-zero expected value formula_10. In image processing especially, where samples are typically restricted to positive values, one often takes formula_10 to be one half of the maximum sample value. In that case, the Fourier coefficient formula_12 corresponding to the zero-frequency component (essentially, the average of the formula_13) will also have a non-zero expected value formula_14; and the power spectrum formula_15 will be flat only over the non-zero frequencies.

===Discrete-time white noise===
A discrete-time stochastic process formula_16 is a generalization of a random vector with a finite number of components to infinitely many components. A discrete-time stochastic process formula_16 is called white noise if its mean is equal to zero for all formula_18 , i.e. formula_19 and if the autocorrelation function formula_20 has a nonzero value only for formula_21, i.e. formula_22.

===Continuous-time white noise===
In order to define the notion of white noise in the theory of continuous-time signals, one must replace the concept of a random vector by a continuous-time random signal; that is, a random process that generates a function formula_9 of a real-valued parameter formula_24.

Such a process is said to be white noise in the strongest sense if the value formula_25 for any time formula_24 is a random variable that is statistically independent of its entire history before formula_24. A weaker definition requires independence only between the values formula_28 and formula_29 at every pair of distinct times formula_30 and formula_31. An even weaker definition requires only that such pairs formula_28 and formula_29 be uncorrelated. As in the discrete case, some authors adopt the weaker definition for white noise, and use the qualifier independent to refer to either of the stronger definitions. Others use weakly white and strongly white to distinguish between them.

However, a precise definition of these concepts is not trivial, because some quantities that are finite sums in the finite discrete case must be replaced by integrals that may not converge. Indeed, the set of all possible instances of a signal formula_9 is no longer a finite-dimensional space formula_35, but an infinite-dimensional function space. Moreover, by any definition a white noise signal formula_9 would have to be essentially discontinuous at every point; therefore even the simplest operations on formula_9, like integration over a finite interval, require advanced mathematical machinery.

Some authors require each value formula_25 to be a real-valued random variable with expectation formula_10 and some finite variance formula_1. Then the covariance formula_41 between the values at two times formula_30 and formula_31 is well-defined: it is zero if the times are distinct, and formula_1 if they are equal. However, by this definition, the integral
: formula_45
over any interval with positive width formula_46 would be simply the width times the expectation: formula_47. This property renders the concept inadequate as a model of white noise signals either in a physical or mathematical sense.

Therefore, most authors define the signal formula_9 indirectly by specifying random values for the integrals of formula_25 and formula_50 over each interval formula_51. In this approach, however, the value of formula_25 at an isolated time cannot be defined as a real-valued random variable. Also the covariance formula_41 becomes infinite when formula_54; and the autocorrelation function formula_55 must be defined as formula_56, where formula_57 is some real constant and formula_58 is the Dirac delta function.

In this approach, one usually specifies that the integral formula_59 of formula_25 over an interval formula_61 is a real random variable with normal distribution, zero mean, and variance formula_62; and also that the covariance formula_63 of the integrals formula_59, formula_65 is formula_66, where formula_46 is the width of the intersection formula_68 of the two intervals formula_69. This model is called a Gaussian white noise signal (or process).

In the mathematical field known as white noise analysis, a Gaussian white noise formula_9 is defined as a stochastic tempered distribution, i.e. a random variable with values in the space formula_71 of tempered distributions. Analogous to the case for finite-dimensional random vectors, a probability law on the infinite-dimensional space formula_71 can be defined via its characteristic function (existence and uniqueness are guaranteed by an extension of the Bochner–Minlos theorem, which goes under the name Bochner–Minlos–Sazanov theorem); analogously to the case of the multivariate normal distribution formula_73, which has characteristic function
: formula_74
the white noise formula_75 must satisfy
: formula_76
where formula_77 is the natural pairing of the tempered distribution formula_78 with the Schwartz function formula_79, taken scenariowise for formula_80, and formula_81.

==Mathematical applications==

===Time series analysis and regression===
In statistics and econometrics one often assumes that an observed series of data values is the sum of the values generated by a deterministic linear process, depending on certain independent (explanatory) variables, and on a series of random noise values. Then regression analysis is used to infer the parameters of the model process from the observed data, e.g. by ordinary least squares, and to test the null hypothesis that each of the parameters is zero against the alternative hypothesis that it is non-zero. Hypothesis testing typically assumes that the noise values are mutually uncorrelated with zero mean and have the same Gaussian probability distributionin other words, that the noise is Gaussian white (not just white). If there is non-zero correlation between the noise values underlying different observations then the estimated model parameters are still unbiased, but estimates of their uncertainties (such as confidence intervals) will be biased (not accurate on average). This is also true if the noise is heteroskedasticthat is, if it has different variances for different data points.

Alternatively, in the subset of regression analysis known as time series analysis there are often no explanatory variables other than the past values of the variable being modeled (the dependent variable). In this case the noise process is often modeled as a moving average process, in which the current value of the dependent variable depends on current and past values of a sequential white noise process.

===Random vector transformations===
These two ideas are crucial in applications such as channel estimation and channel equalization in communications and audio. These concepts are also used in data compression.
In particular, by a suitable linear transformation (a coloring transformation), a white random vector can be used to produce a non-white random vector (that is, a list of random variables) whose elements have a prescribed covariance matrix. Conversely, a random vector with known covariance matrix can be transformed into a white random vector by a suitable whitening transformation.

==Generation==
White noise may be generated digitally with a digital signal processor, microprocessor, or microcontroller. Generating white noise typically entails feeding an appropriate stream of random numbers to a digital-to-analog converter. The quality of the white noise will depend on the quality of the algorithm used.

==Informal use==
The term is sometimes used as a colloquialism to describe a backdrop of ambient sound, creating an indistinct or seamless commotion. Following are some examples:

*Chatter from multiple conversations within the acoustics of a confined space.
*The pleonastic jargon used by politicians to mask a point that they don&#x27;t want noticed.
*Music that is disagreeable, harsh, dissonant or discordant with no melody.

The term can also be used metaphorically, as in the novel &quot;White Noise&quot; (1985) by Don DeLillo which explores the symptoms of modern culture that came together so as to make it difficult for an individual to actualize their ideas and personality.

<text>Butter is a dairy product made from the fat and protein components of churned cream. It is a semi-solid emulsion at room temperature, consisting of approximately 80% butterfat. It is used at room temperature as a spread, melted as a condiment, and used as a fat in baking, sauce-making, pan frying, and other cooking procedures.

Most frequently made from cow&#x27;s milk, butter can also be manufactured from the milk of other mammals, including sheep, goats, buffalo, and yaks. It is made by churning milk or cream to separate the fat globules from the buttermilk. Salt has been added to butter since antiquity to help preserve it, particularly when being transported; salt may still play a preservation role but is less important today as the entire supply chain is usually refrigerated. In modern times, salt may be added for taste. Food coloring is sometimes added to butter. Rendering butter, removing the water and milk solids, produces clarified butter, or &quot;ghee&quot;, which is almost entirely butterfat.

Butter is a water-in-oil emulsion resulting from an inversion of the cream, where the milk proteins are the emulsifiers. Butter remains a firm solid when refrigerated but softens to a spreadable consistency at room temperature and melts to a thin liquid consistency at . The density of butter is . It generally has a pale yellow color but varies from deep yellow to nearly white. Its natural, unmodified color is dependent on the source animal&#x27;s feed and genetics, but the commercial manufacturing process sometimes alters this with food colorings like annatto or carotene.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;butter&quot; derives (via Germanic languages) from the Latin &quot;butyrum&quot;, which is the latinisation of the Greek βούτυρον (&quot;bouturon&quot;) and βούτυρος. This may be a compound of βοῦς (&quot;bous&quot;), &quot;ox, cow&quot; + τυρός (&quot;turos&quot;), &quot;cheese&quot;, that is &quot;cow-cheese&quot;. The word &quot;turos&quot; (&quot;cheese&quot;) is attested in Mycenaean Greek. The Latinized form is found in the name butyric acid, a compound found in rancid butter and other dairy products.

==Production==
Unhomogenized milk and cream contain butterfat in microscopic globules. These globules are surrounded by membranes made of phospholipids (fatty acid emulsifiers) and proteins, which prevent the fat in milk from pooling together into a single mass. Butter is produced by agitating cream, which damages these membranes and allows the milk fats to conjoin, separating from the other parts of the cream. Variations in the production method will create butters with different consistencies, mostly due to the butterfat composition in the finished product. Butter contains fat in three separate forms: free butterfat, butterfat crystals, and undamaged fat globules. In the finished product, different proportions of these forms result in different consistencies within the butter; butters with many crystals are harder than butters dominated by free fats.

Churning produces small butter grains floating in the water-based portion of the cream. This watery liquid is called buttermilk, although the buttermilk most commonly sold today is instead directly fermented skimmed milk. The buttermilk is drained off; sometimes more buttermilk is removed by rinsing the grains with water. Then the grains are &quot;worked&quot;: pressed and kneaded together. When prepared manually, this is done using wooden boards called scotch hands. This consolidates the butter into a solid mass and breaks up embedded pockets of buttermilk or water into tiny droplets.

Commercial butter is about 80% butterfat and 15% water; traditionally-made butter may have as little as 65% fat and 30% water. Butterfat is a mixture of triglyceride, a triester derived from glycerol, and three of any of several fatty acid groups. Annatto is sometimes added by U.S. butter manufacturers without declaring it on the label because the U.S. allows butter to have an undisclosed flavorless and natural coloring agent (whereas all other foods in the U.S. must label coloring agents). The preservative lactic acid is sometimes added instead of salt (and as a flavor enhancer), and sometimes additional diacetyl is added to boost the buttery flavor (in the U.S., both ingredients can be listed simply as &quot;natural flavors&quot;). When used together in the NIZO manufacturing method, these two flavorings produce the flavor of cultured butter without actually fully fermenting.

==Types==

Before modern factory butter making, cream was usually collected from several milkings and was therefore several days old and somewhat fermented by the time it was made into butter. Butter made in this traditional way (from a fermented cream) is known as cultured butter. During fermentation, the cream naturally sours as bacteria convert milk sugars into lactic acid. The fermentation process produces additional aroma compounds, including diacetyl, which makes for a fuller-flavored and more &quot;buttery&quot; tasting product.

Butter made from fresh cream is called sweet cream butter. Production of sweet cream butter first became common in the 19th century, when the development of refrigeration and the mechanical milk separator made sweet cream butter faster and cheaper to produce at scale (sweet cream butter can be made in 6 hours, whereas cultured butter can take up to 72 hours to make).

Cultured butter is preferred throughout continental Europe, while sweet cream butter dominates in the United States and the United Kingdom. Chef Jansen Chan, the director of pastry operations at the International Culinary Center in Manhattan, says, &quot;It&#x27;s no secret that dairy in France and most of Europe is higher quality than most of the U.S.&quot; The combination of butter culturing, the 82% butterfat minimum (as opposed to the 80% minimum in the U.S.), and the fact that French butter is grass-fed, accounts for why French pastry (and French food in general) has a reputation for being richer-tasting and flakier. Cultured butter is sometimes labeled &quot;European-style&quot; butter in the United States, although cultured butter is made and sold by some, especially Amish, dairies.

Milk that is to be made into butter is usually pasteurized during production to kill pathogenic bacteria and other microbes. Butter made from raw milk is very rare and can be dangerous because it is made from unpasteurized milk. Commercial raw milk products are not legal to sell through interstate commerce in the United States and are very rare in Europe. Raw cream butter is generally only found made at home by dairy farmers or by consumers who have purchased raw whole milk directly from them, skimmed the cream themselves, and made butter with it.

=== Clarified butter ===
Clarified butter has almost all of its water and milk solids removed, leaving almost-pure butterfat. Clarified butter is made by heating butter to its melting point and then allowing it to cool; after settling, the remaining components separate by density. At the top, whey proteins form a skin, which is removed. The resulting butterfat is then poured off from the mixture of water and casein proteins that settle to the bottom.

Ghee is clarified butter that has been heated to around 120 °C (250 °F) after the water evaporated, turning the milk solids brown. This process flavors the ghee, and also produces antioxidants that help protect it from rancidity. Because of this, ghee can be kept for six to eight months under normal conditions.

===Whey butter===
Cream may be separated (usually by a centrifuge or a sedimentation) from whey instead of milk, as a byproduct of cheese-making. Whey butter may be made from whey cream. Whey cream and butter have a lower fat content and taste more salty, tangy and &quot;cheesy&quot;. They are also cheaper to make than &quot;sweet&quot; cream and butter. The fat content of whey is low, so 1,000 pounds of whey will typically give only three pounds of butter.

===European butters===
There are several butters produced in Europe with protected geographical indications; these include:
* Beurre d&#x27;Ardenne, from Belgium
* Beurre d&#x27;Isigny, from France
* Beurre Charentes-Poitou (Which also includes: Beurre des Charentes and Beurre des Deux-Sèvres under the same classification), from France
* Beurre Rose, from Luxembourg
* Mantequilla de Soria, from Spain
* Mantega de l&#x27;Alt Urgell i la Cerdanya, from Spain
* Rucava white butter (&quot;Rucavas baltais sviests&quot;), from Latvia

==History==
Elaine Khosrova traces the invention of butter back to Neolithic-era Africa 8,000 BC in her book. A later Sumerian tablet, dating to approximately 2,500 B.C., describes the butter making process, from the milking of cattle, while contemporary Sumerian tablets identify butter as a ritual offering.

In the Mediterranean climate, unclarified butter spoils quickly, unlike cheese, so it is not a practical method of preserving the nutrients of milk. The ancient Greeks and Romans seemed to use the butter only as unguent and medicine and considered it as a food of the barbarians. 
A play by the Greek comic poet Anaxandrides refers to Thracians as &quot;boutyrophagoi&quot;, &quot;butter-eaters&quot;. In his &quot;Natural History&quot;, Pliny the Elder calls butter &quot;the most delicate of food among barbarous nations&quot; and goes on to describe its medicinal properties. Later, the physician Galen also described butter as a medicinal agent only.

===Middle Ages===

In the cooler climates of northern Europe, people could store butter longer before it spoiled. Scandinavia has the oldest tradition in Europe of butter export trade, dating at least to the 12th century. After the fall of Rome and through much of the Middle Ages, butter was a common food across most of Europe—but had a low reputation, and so was consumed principally by peasants. Butter slowly became more accepted by the upper class, notably when the Roman Catholic Church allowed its consumption during Lent from the early 16th century. Bread and butter became common fare among the middle class and the English, in particular, gained a reputation for their liberal use of melted butter as a sauce with meat and vegetables.

In antiquity, butter was used for fuel in lamps, as a substitute for oil. The &quot;Butter Tower&quot; of Rouen Cathedral was erected in the early 16th century when Archbishop Georges d&#x27;Amboise authorized the burning of butter during Lent, instead of oil, which was scarce at the time.

Across northern Europe, butter was sometimes packed into barrels () and buried in peat bogs, perhaps for years. Such &quot;bog butter&quot; would develop a strong flavor as it aged, but remain edible, in large part because of the cool, airless, antiseptic and acidic environment of a peat bog. Firkins of such buried butter are a common archaeological find in Ireland; the National Museum of Ireland – Archaeology has some containing &quot;a grayish cheese-like substance, partially hardened, not much like butter, and quite free from putrefaction.&quot; The practice was most common in Ireland in the 11th–14th centuries; it ended entirely before the 19th century.

===Industrialization===
Until the 19th century, the vast majority of butter was made by hand, on farms. Butter also provided extra income to farm families. They used wood presses with carved decoration to press butter into pucks or small bricks to sell at nearby markets or general stores. The decoration identified the farm that produced the butter. This practice continued until production was mechanized and butter was produced in less decorative stick form.

Like Ireland, France became well known for its butter, particularly in Normandy and Brittany. Butter consumption in London in the mid-1840s was estimated at 15,357 tons annually.

The first butter factories appeared in the United States in the early 1860s, after the successful introduction of cheese factories a decade earlier. In the late 1870s, the centrifugal cream separator was introduced, marketed most successfully by Swedish engineer Carl Gustaf Patrik de Laval.
In 1920, Otto Hunziker authored &quot;The Butter Industry, Prepared for Factory, School and Laboratory&quot;, a well-known text in the industry that enjoyed at least three editions (1920, 1927, 1940). As part of the efforts of the American Dairy Science Association, Hunziker and others published articles regarding: causes of tallowiness (an odor defect, distinct from rancidity, a taste defect); mottles (an aesthetic issue related to uneven color); introduced salts; the impact of creamery metals and liquids; and acidity measurement. These and other ADSA publications helped standardize practices internationally.

Butter consumption declined in most western nations during the 20th century, mainly because of the rising popularity of margarine, which is less expensive and, until recent years, was perceived as being healthier. In the United States, margarine consumption overtook butter during the 1950s, and it is still the case today that more margarine than butter is eaten in the U.S. and the EU.

==Worldwide production==
In 1997, India produced of butter, most of which was consumed domestically. Second in production was the United States (), followed by France (), Germany (), and New Zealand (). France ranks first in per capita butter consumption with 8 kg per capita per year. In terms of absolute consumption, Germany was second after India, using of butter in 1997, followed by France (), Russia (), and the United States (). New Zealand, Australia, Denmark and Ukraine are among the few nations that export a significant percentage of the butter they produce.

Different varieties are found around the world. &quot;Smen&quot; is a spiced Moroccan clarified butter, buried in the ground and aged for months or years. A similar product is &quot;maltash&quot; of the Hunza Valley, where cow and yak butter can be buried for decades, and is used at events such as weddings. Yak butter is a specialty in Tibet; &quot;tsampa&quot;, barley flour mixed with yak butter, is a staple food. Butter tea is consumed in the Himalayan regions of Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal and India. It consists of tea served with intensely flavored—or &quot;rancid&quot;—yak butter and salt. In African and Asian nations, butter is sometimes traditionally made from sour milk rather than cream. It can take several hours of churning to produce workable butter grains from fermented milk.

==Storage==

Normal butter softens to a spreadable consistency around 15 °C (60 °F), well above refrigerator temperatures. The &quot;butter compartment&quot; found in many refrigerators may be one of the warmer sections inside, but it still leaves butter quite hard. Until recently, many refrigerators sold in New Zealand featured a &quot;butter conditioner&quot;, a compartment kept warmer than the rest of the refrigerator—but still cooler than room temperature—with a small heater. Keeping butter tightly wrapped delays rancidity, which is hastened by exposure to light or air, and also helps prevent it from picking up other odors. Wrapped butter has a shelf life of several months at refrigerator temperatures. Butter can also be frozen to extend its storage life.

===Packaging===
====United States====
In the United States, butter has traditionally been made into small, rectangular blocks by means of a pair of wooden butter paddles. It is usually produced in sticks that are individually wrapped in waxed or foiled paper, and sold as a package of 4 sticks. This practice is believed to have originated in 1907, when Swift and Company began packaging butter in this manner for mass distribution.
Due to historical differences in butter printers (machines that cut and package butter), 4-ounce sticks are commonly produced in two different shapes:

* The dominant shape east of the Rocky Mountains is the Elgin, or Eastern-pack shape, named for a dairy in Elgin, Illinois. The sticks measure and are typically sold stacked two by two in elongated cube-shaped boxes.
* West of the Rocky Mountains, butter printers standardized on a different shape that is now referred to as the Western-pack shape. These butter sticks measure and are usually sold with four sticks packed side-by-side in a flat, rectangular box.

Most butter dishes are designed for Elgin-style butter sticks.

====Elsewhere====
Outside the United States, butter is measured for sale by mass (rather than by volume or unit/stick), and is often sold in and packages.

====Bulk packaging====

Since the 1940s, but more commonly the 1960s, butter pats have been individually wrapped and packed in cardboard boxes. Prior to use of cardboard, butter was bulk packed in wood. The earliest discoveries used firkins. From about 1882 wooden boxes were used, as the introduction of refrigeration on ships brought about longer transit times. Butter boxes were generally made with woods whose resin would not taint the butter, such as sycamore, kahikatea, hoop pine, maple, or spruce. They commonly weighed a firkin at .

==In cooking and gastronomy==

Butter has been considered indispensable in French cuisine since the 17th century. Chefs and cooks have extolled its importance: Fernand Point said &quot;Donnez-moi du beurre, encore du beurre, toujours du beurre!&quot; (&#x27;Give me butter, more butter, still more butter!&#x27;). Julia Child said, &quot;With enough butter, anything is good.&quot;

Melted butter plays an important role in the preparation of sauces, notably in French cuisine. &quot;Beurre noisette&quot; (hazelnut butter) and &quot;Beurre noir&quot; (black butter) are sauces of melted butter cooked until the milk solids and sugars have turned golden or dark brown; they are often finished with an addition of vinegar or lemon juice. Hollandaise and béarnaise sauces are emulsions of egg yolk and melted butter. Hollandaise and béarnaise sauces are stabilized with the powerful emulsifiers in the egg yolks, but butter itself contains enough emulsifiers—mostly remnants of the fat globule membranes—to form a stable emulsion on its own.

&quot;Beurre blanc&quot; (white butter) is made by whisking butter into reduced vinegar or wine, forming an emulsion with the texture of thick cream. &quot;Beurre monté&quot; (prepared butter) is melted but still emulsified butter; it lends its name to the practice of &quot;mounting&quot; a sauce with butter: whisking cold butter into any water-based sauce at the end of cooking, giving the sauce a thicker body and a glossy shine—as well as a buttery taste.

Butter is used for sautéing and frying, although its milk solids brown and burn above 150 °C (250 °F)—a rather low temperature for most applications. The smoke point of butterfat is around 200 °C (400 °F), so clarified butter or ghee is better suited to frying. 

Butter fills several roles in baking, including making possible a range of textures, making chemical leavenings work better, tenderizing proteins, and enhancing the tastes of other ingredients. It is used in a similar manner to other solid fats like lard, suet, or shortening, but has a flavor that may better complement sweet baked goods.

Compound butters are mixtures of butter and other ingredients used to flavor various dishes.

==Nutritional information==

Butter (salted during manufacturing) is 16% water, 81% fat, and 1% protein, with negligible carbohydrates (provided from table source as 100 g). Saturated fat is 51% of total fats in butter (table source).

In a reference amount of , butter supplies 717 calories and 76% of the Daily Value (DV) for vitamin A, 15% DV for vitamin E, and 28% DV for sodium, with no other micronutrients in significant content (table). In 100 grams, salted butter contains 215 mg of cholesterol (table source).

As butter is essentially just the milk fat, it contains only traces of lactose, so moderate consumption of butter is not a problem for lactose intolerant people. People with milk allergies may still need to avoid butter, which contains enough of the allergy-causing proteins to cause reactions.

==Health concerns==
A 2015 study concluded that &quot;hypercholesterolemic people should keep their consumption of butter to a minimum, whereas moderate butter intake may be considered part of the diet in the normocholesterolemic population.&quot;

A meta-analysis and systematic review published in 2016 found relatively small or insignificant overall associations of a dose of 14g/day of butter with mortality and cardiovascular disease, and consumption was insignificantly inversely associated with incidence of diabetes. The study states that &quot;findings do not support a need for major emphasis in dietary guidelines on either increasing or decreasing butter consumption.&quot;

<text>The Star Beast is a 1954 science fiction novel by Robert A. Heinlein about a high school senior who discovers that his extraterrestrial pet is more than it appears to be. The novel was originally serialised, somewhat abridged (as &quot;Star Lummox&quot;), in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; (May, June, July 1954) as &quot;Star Lummox&quot; and then published in hardcover as part of Scribner&#x27;s series of Heinlein juveniles.

==Plot summary==

In the future, Earth has had interstellar spaceflight for centuries and has made contact with numerous extraterrestrial intelligent species. John Thomas Stuart XI, the teenage protagonist, lives in a small Rocky Mountain town, Westville, caring for Lummox, an extraterrestrial beast his great-grandfather had brought home. Lummox has learned how to speak, and has gradually grown from the size of a collie pup to a ridable behemoth—especially after consuming a used car. The childlike Lummox is perceived to be a neighborhood nuisance and, upon leaving the Stuart property one day, causes substantial property damage across the city. John&#x27;s widowed mother wants him to get rid of it, and brings an action in the local court to have it destroyed.

Desperate to save his pet, John Thomas considers selling Lummox to a zoo. He rapidly changes his mind and runs away from home, riding into the nearby wilderness on Lummox&#x27;s back. His girlfriend Betty Sorenson joins him and suggests bringing the beast back into town and hiding it in a neighbor&#x27;s greenhouse. However, it is not easy to conceal such a large creature. Eventually, the court orders Lummox destroyed. City officials try several methods to kill Lummox but fail, as his alien physiology appears to be virtually invulnerable to ordinary weapons or poisons, and Lummox does not even realize they are attempting to execute him.

Meanwhile, at the Earth government Department of Spacial Affairs, Mr. Kiku, the Permanent Undersecretary and an expert diplomat, is dealing with the Hroshii, a previously unknown, advanced and powerful alien race. They demand the return of their lost child, or they will destroy Earth. A friendly alien diplomat of a third species intimates that the threat is not an empty one. Initially, no one associates Lummox with the newcomers, in part due to the size difference (Lummox grew very large from overfeeding). Lummox is finally identified as important Hroshii royalty, as well as approximately female (the Hroshii have six sexes). It turns out that the relationship between John Thomas and Lummox may be the only thing that saves Earth from destruction. From her viewpoint, during her centuries on Earth, the young but extremely long-lived Lummox has been pursuing a hobby: the raising of John Thomases. She makes it clear to the other Hroshii that she intends to continue doing so. This gives Mr. Kiku, the chief negotiator, the leverage he needs to pressure the aliens into establishing diplomatic relations. At the insistence of Lummox, the newly married John and Betty accompany her back to the Hroshii homeworld as part of the human diplomatic mission.

==Reception==
Damon Knight wrote:
Groff Conklin described the novel as &quot;one of Heinlein&#x27;s most enchanting tales.&quot; P. Schuyler Miller found &quot;The Star Beast&quot; to be &quot;one of the best of 1954.&quot;

==Editions==
The F&amp;SF serialization has a series of illustrations by Fred Kirberger (two covers plus black and white interior art). Although the secondary protagonist Mr. Kiku is clearly portrayed in the text as a black Kenyan, he is illustrated as a white man. None of Kirberger&#x27;s art depicts Lummox or the other Hroshii except as vague shapes or textures at the edges of some scenes. The original Scribner&#x27;s hardcover edition has cover art and a frontispiece by Clifford Geary that do depict Lummox.

Some paperback editions and the Science Fiction Book Club hard cover edition omit page 148 of Chapter VIII, &quot;The Sensible Thing to Do&quot;, which was in the Scribner&#x27;s edition and the magazine serialization. In this chapter, John Thomas rereads the entries in his great-grandfather&#x27;s diary of how Lummox was found. Of significance on the omitted page is that:

The diary skipped a couple of days; the &quot;Trail Blazer&quot; had made an emergency raise-ship and Assistant Powerman J. T. Stuart had been too busy to write. John Thomas knew why ... the negotiations opened so hopefully with the dominant race had failed ... no one knew why.

The rest of the page summarizes John Thomas&#x27; grandfather&#x27;s family history, discussing the first John Thomas Stuart, who had retired as a sea captain. The history, as reprinted in the paperback and Science Fiction Book Club editions, then resumes with John Thomas Stuart, Junior.

<text>A lobotomy () or leucotomy is a discredited form of neurosurgical treatment for psychiatric disorder or neurological disorder (e.g. epilepsy, depression) that involves severing connections in the brain&#x27;s prefrontal cortex. The surgery causes most of the connections to and from the prefrontal cortex, the anterior part of the frontal lobes of the brain, to be severed.

In the past, this treatment was used for handling psychiatric disorders as a mainstream procedure in some countries. The procedure was controversial from its initial use, in part due to a lack of recognition of the severity and chronicity of severe and enduring psychiatric illnesses, so it was said to be an inappropriate treatment.

The originator of the procedure, Portuguese neurologist António Egas Moniz, shared the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine of 1949 for the &quot;discovery of the therapeutic value of leucotomy in certain psychoses&quot;, although the awarding of the prize has been subject to controversy.

The use of the procedure increased dramatically from the early 1940s and into the 1950s; by 1951, almost 20,000 lobotomies had been performed in the United States and proportionally more in the United Kingdom. More lobotomies were performed on women than on men: a 1951 study found that nearly 60% of American lobotomy patients were women, and limited data shows that 74% of lobotomies in Ontario from 1948 to 1952 were performed on female patients. From the 1950s onward, lobotomy began to be abandoned, first in the Soviet Union and Europe. However, derivatives of it such as stereotactic tractotomy and bilateral cingulotomy are still used.
==Outline==
Historically, patients of frontal lobotomy were, immediately following surgery, often stuporous and incontinent. Some developed an enormous appetite and gained considerable weight. Seizures were another common complication of surgery. Emphasis was put on the training of patients in the weeks and months following surgery.

The purpose of the operation was to reduce the symptoms of mental disorders, and it was recognized that this was accomplished at the expense of a person&#x27;s personality and intellect. British psychiatrist Maurice Partridge, who conducted a follow-up study of 300 patients, said the treatment achieved its effects by &quot;reducing the complexity of psychic life&quot;. Following the operation, spontaneity, responsiveness, self-awareness, and self-control were reduced. The activity was replaced by inertia, and people were mostly left emotionally blunted and restricted in their intellectual range.

The consequences of the operation have been described as &quot;mixed&quot;. However, many lobotomy patients suffered devastating postoperative complications, including intracranial hemorrhage, epilepsy, alterations in affect and personality, brain abscess, dementia, and death. Ominous portrayals of lobotomized patients in novels, plays, and films further diminished public opinion, and the development of antipsychotic medications led to a rapid decline in lobotomy&#x27;s popularity and Freeman’s reputation. Others could leave the hospital or become more manageable within the hospital. 
A precarious number of people managed to return to responsible work, while at the other extreme, people were left with severe and disabling impairments. Most people fell into an intermediate group, left with some improvement of their symptoms but also with emotional and intellectual deficits to which they made a better or worse adjustment. On average, there was a mortality rate of approximately 5% during the 1940s. A survey of British lobotomy patients lobotomised between 1942 and 1954 found that 13% of patients were deemed to have made a full recovery and a further 28% were deemed to have made a significant recovery; for 25% lobotomy was deemed to have made no change and 4% died as a result of the surgery.

The frontal lobotomy procedure could have severe negative effects on a patient&#x27;s personality and ability to function independently. Lobotomy patients often show a marked reduction in initiative and inhibition. They may also exhibit difficulty imagining themselves in the position of others because of decreased cognition and detachment from society.

Walter Freeman coined the term &quot;surgically induced childhood&quot; and used it constantly to refer to the results of lobotomy. The operation left people with an &quot;infantile personality&quot;; a period of maturation would then, according to Freeman, lead to recovery. In an unpublished memoir, he described how the &quot;personality of the patient was changed in some way in the hope of rendering him more amenable to the social pressures under which he is supposed to exist.&quot; He described one 29-year-old woman as being, following lobotomy, a &quot;smiling, lazy and satisfactory patient with the personality of an oyster&quot; who could not remember Freeman&#x27;s name and endlessly poured coffee from an empty pot. When her parents had difficulty dealing with her behavior, Freeman advised a system of rewards (ice cream) and punishment (smacks).

==History==

In the early 20th century, the number of patients residing in mental hospitals increased significantly while little in the way of effective medical treatment was available. Lobotomy was one of a series of radical and invasive physical therapies developed in Europe at this time that signaled a break with the psychiatric culture of therapeutic nihilism which had prevailed since the mid-nineteenth-century. The new &quot;heroic&quot; physical therapies devised during this experimental era, including malarial therapy for general paresis of the insane (1917), deep sleep therapy (1920), insulin shock therapy (1933), cardiazol shock therapy (1934), and electroconvulsive therapy (1938), served to galvanize a profession which had been both therapeutically moribund and systemically demoralized. Unlike other medical disciplines (e.g., Cardiology, Dermatology, Orthopedics, etc.) which applied surgical and pharmacological treatments that were both apparent and measurable regarding their efficacy, psychiatry had often struggled with quantification. These novel remedial methodologies, however, meant that (at the time) modern psychiatric treatments were no longer relegated to the metaphysical or abstract, and this increased the popularity of the field among clinicians and prospective patients alike. Suddenly, conditions like insanity, psychosis, and others felt less like incurable afflictions, and more like surmountable diagnoses - emboldening psychiatrists to attempt new procedures. Additionally, the relative (and quantitative) success of the shock therapies, despite the considerable risks they posed to patients, also helped to inspire doctors in the field to pioneer ever more drastic forms of medical interventions up to, and including, lobotomies.

The clinician-historian Joel Braslow argues that from malarial therapy onward to lobotomy, physical psychiatric therapies &quot;spiral closer and closer to the interior of the brain&quot; with this organ increasingly taking &quot;center stage as a source of disease and site of cure&quot;. For Roy Porter, once the doyen of medical history, the often violent and invasive psychiatric interventions developed during the 1930s and 1940s are indicative of both the well-intentioned desire of psychiatrists to find some medical means of alleviating the suffering of the vast number of patients than in psychiatric hospitals and also the relative lack of social power of those same patients to resist the increasingly radical and even reckless interventions of asylum doctors. Many doctors, patients, and family members of the period believed that despite potentially catastrophic consequences, the results of lobotomy were seemingly positive in many instances or, were at least deemed as such when measured next to the apparent alternative of long-term institutionalisation. Lobotomy has always been controversial, but for a period of the medical mainstream, it was even feted and regarded as a legitimate last-resort remedy for categories of patients who were otherwise regarded as hopeless. Today, lobotomy has become a disparaged procedure, a byword for medical barbarism and an exemplary instance of the medical trampling of patients&#x27; rights.

===Early psychosurgery===
Before the 1930s, individual doctors had infrequently experimented with novel surgical operations on those deemed insane. Most notably in 1888, Swiss psychiatrist Gottlieb Burckhardt initiated what is commonly considered the first systematic attempt at modern human psychosurgery. He operated on six chronic patients under his care at the Swiss Préfargier Asylum, removing sections of their cerebral cortex. Burckhardt&#x27;s decision to operate was informed by three pervasive views on the nature of mental illness and its relationship to the brain. First, the belief that mental illness was organic in nature, and reflected an underlying brain pathology; next, that the nervous system was organized according to an associationist model comprising an input or afferent system (a sensory center), a connecting system where information processing took place (an association center), and an output or efferent system (a motor center); and, finally, a modular conception of the brain whereby discrete mental faculties were connected to specific regions of the brain. Burckhardt&#x27;s hypothesis was that by deliberately creating lesions in regions of the brain identified as association centers, a transformation in behaviour might ensue. According to his model, those mentally ill might experience &quot;excitations abnormal in quality, quantity and intensity&quot; in the sensory regions of the brain and this abnormal stimulation would then be transmitted to the motor regions giving rise to mental pathology. He reasoned, however, that removing material from either of the sensory or motor zones could give rise to &quot;grave functional disturbance&quot;. Instead, by targeting the association centers and creating a &quot;ditch&quot; around the motor region of the temporal lobe, he hoped to break their lines of communication and thus alleviate both mental symptoms and the experience of mental distress.

Intending to ameliorate symptoms in those with violent and intractable conditions rather than effect a cure, Burckhardt began operating on patients in December 1888, but both his surgical methods and instruments were crude and the results of the procedure were mixed at best. He operated on six patients in total and, according to his own assessment, two experienced no change, two patients became quieter, one patient experienced epileptic convulsions and died a few days after the operation, and one patient improved. Complications included motor weakness, epilepsy, sensory aphasia and &quot;word deafness&quot;. Claiming a success rate of 50 percent, he presented the results at the Berlin Medical Congress and published a report, but the response from his medical peers was hostile and he did no further operations.

In 1912, two physicians based in Saint Petersburg, the leading Russian neurologist Vladimir Bekhterev and his younger Estonian colleague, the neurosurgeon Ludvig Puusepp, published a paper reviewing a range of surgical interventions that had been performed on the mentally ill. While generally treating these endeavours favorably, in their consideration of psychosurgery they reserved unremitting scorn for Burckhardt&#x27;s surgical experiments of 1888 and opined that it was extraordinary that a trained medical doctor could undertake such an unsound procedure.
The authors neglected to mention, however, that in 1910 Puusepp himself had performed surgery on the brains of three mentally ill patients, sectioning the cortex between the frontal and parietal lobes. He had abandoned these attempts because of unsatisfactory results and this experience probably inspired the invective that was directed at Burckhardt in the 1912 article. By 1937, Puusepp, despite his earlier criticism of Burckhardt, was increasingly persuaded that psychosurgery could be a valid medical intervention for the mentally disturbed. In the late 1930s, he worked closely with the neurosurgical team of the Racconigi Hospital near Turin to establish it as an early and influential centre for the adoption of leucotomy in Italy.

===Development===

Leucotomy was first undertaken in 1935 under the direction of the Portuguese neurologist (and inventor of the term &quot;psychosurgery&quot;) António Egas Moniz. First developing an interest in psychiatric conditions and their somatic treatment in the early 1930s, Moniz conceived a new opportunity for recognition in the development of a surgical intervention on the brain as a treatment for mental illness.

====Frontal lobes====
The source of inspiration for Moniz&#x27;s decision to hazard psychosurgery has been clouded by contradictory statements made on the subject by Moniz and others both contemporaneously and retrospectively. The traditional narrative addresses the question of why Moniz targeted the frontal lobes by way of reference to the work of the Yale neuroscientist John Fulton and, most dramatically, to a presentation Fulton made with his junior colleague Carlyle Jacobsen at the Second International Congress of Neurology held in London in 1935. Fulton&#x27;s primary area of research was on the cortical function of primates and he had established America&#x27;s first primate neurophysiology laboratory at Yale in the early 1930s. At the 1935 Congress, with Moniz in attendance, Fulton and Jacobsen presented two chimpanzees, named Becky and Lucy who had had frontal lobectomies and subsequent changes in behaviour and intellectual function. According to Fulton&#x27;s account of the congress, they explained that before surgery, both animals, and especially Becky, the more emotional of the two, exhibited &quot;frustrational behaviour&quot;that is, have tantrums that could include rolling on the floor and defecatingif, because of their poor performance in a set of experimental tasks, they were not rewarded. Following the surgical removal of their frontal lobes, the behaviour of both primates changed markedly and Becky was pacified to such a degree that Jacobsen apparently stated it was as if she had joined a &quot;happiness cult&quot;. During the question and answer section of the paper, Moniz, it is alleged, &quot;startled&quot; Fulton by inquiring if this procedure might be extended to human subjects suffering from mental illness. Fulton stated that he replied that while possible in theory it was surely &quot;too formidable&quot; an intervention for use on humans.
Moniz began his experiments with leucotomy just three months after the congress had reinforced the apparent cause-and-effect relationship between the Fulton and Jacobsen presentation and the Portuguese neurologist&#x27;s resolve to operate on the frontal lobes. As the author of this account Fulton, who has sometimes been claimed as the father of lobotomy, was later able to record that the technique had its true origination in his laboratory. Endorsing this version of events, in 1949, the Harvard neurologist Stanley Cobb remarked during his presidential address to the American Neurological Association that &quot;seldom in the history of medicine has a laboratory observation been so quickly and dramatically translated into a therapeutic procedure&quot;. Fulton&#x27;s report, penned ten years after the events described, is, however, without corroboration in the historical record and bears little resemblance to an earlier unpublished account he wrote of the congress. In this previous narrative, he mentioned an incidental, private exchange with Moniz, but it is likely that the official version of their public conversation he promulgated is without foundation. In fact, Moniz stated that he had conceived of the operation sometime before his journey to London in 1935, having told in confidence his junior colleague, the young neurosurgeon Pedro Almeida Lima, as early as 1933 of his psychosurgical idea. The traditional account exaggerates the importance of Fulton and Jacobsen to Moniz&#x27;s decision to initiate frontal lobe surgery, and omits the fact that a detailed body of neurological research that emerged at this time suggested to Moniz and other neurologists and neurosurgeons that surgery on this part of the brain might yield significant personality changes in the mentally ill.

The frontal lobes have been the object of scientific inquiry and speculation since the late 19th century. Fulton&#x27;s contribution, while it may have functioned as a source of intellectual support, is in itself unnecessary and inadequate as an explanation of Moniz&#x27;s resolution to operate on this section of the brain. Under an evolutionary and hierarchical model of brain development it had been hypothesized that those regions associated with the more recent development, such as the mammalian brain and, most especially, the frontal lobes, were responsible for more complex cognitive functions. However, this theoretical formulation found little laboratory support, as 19th-century experimentation found no significant change in animal behaviour following surgical removal or electrical stimulation of the frontal lobes. This picture of the so-called &quot;silent lobe&quot; changed in the period after World War I with the production of clinical reports of ex-servicemen with brain trauma. The refinement of neurosurgical techniques also facilitated increasing attempts to remove brain tumours, and treat focal epilepsy in humans and led to more precise experimental neurosurgery in animal studies. Cases were reported where mental symptoms were alleviated following the surgical removal of diseased or damaged brain tissue. The accumulation of medical case studies on behavioural changes following damage to the frontal lobes led to the formulation of the concept of &quot;Witzelsucht&quot;, which designated a neurological condition characterised by a certain hilarity and childishness in those with the condition. The picture of frontal lobe function that emerged from these studies was complicated by the observation that neurological deficits attendant on damage to a single lobe might be compensated for if the opposite lobe remained intact. In 1922, the Italian neurologist Leonardo Bianchi published a detailed report on the results of bilateral lobectomies in animals that supported the contention that the frontal lobes were both integral to intellectual function and that their removal led to the disintegration of the subject&#x27;s personality. This work, while influential, was not without its critics due to deficiencies in experimental design.

The first bilateral lobectomy of a human subject was performed by the American neurosurgeon Walter Dandy in 1930. The neurologist Richard Brickner reported on this case in 1932, relating that the recipient, known as &quot;Patient A&quot;, while experiencing a blunting of affect, had no apparent decrease in intellectual function and seemed, at least to the casual observer, perfectly normal. Brickner concluded from this evidence that &quot;the frontal lobes are not &#x27;centers&#x27; for the intellect&quot;. These clinical results were replicated in a similar operation undertaken in 1934 by the neurosurgeon Roy Glenwood Spurling and reported on by the neuropsychiatrist Spafford Ackerly. By the mid-1930s, interest in the function of the frontal lobes reached a high-water mark. This was reflected in the 1935 neurological congress in London, which hosted as part of its deliberations, &quot;a remarkable symposium ... on the functions of the frontal lobes&quot;. The panel was chaired by Henri Claude, a French neuropsychiatrist, who commenced the session by reviewing the state of research on the frontal lobes, and concluded that &quot;altering the frontal lobes profoundly modifies the personality of subjects&quot;. This parallel symposium contained numerous papers by neurologists, neurosurgeons and psychologists; amongst these was one by Brickner, which impressed Moniz greatly, that again detailed the case of &quot;Patient A&quot;. Fulton and Jacobsen&#x27;s paper, presented in another session of the conference on experimental physiology, was notable in linking animal and human studies on the function of the frontal lobes. Thus, at the time of the 1935 Congress, Moniz had available to him an increasing body of research on the role of the frontal lobes that extended well beyond the observations of Fulton and Jacobsen.

Nor was Moniz the only medical practitioner in the 1930s to have contemplated procedures directly targeting the frontal lobes. Although ultimately discounting brain surgery as carrying too much risk, physicians and neurologists such as William Mayo, Thierry de Martel, Richard Brickner, and Leo Davidoff had, before 1935, entertained the proposition. Inspired by Julius Wagner-Jauregg&#x27;s development of malarial therapy for the treatment of general paresis of the insane, the French physician Maurice Ducosté reported in 1932 that he had injected 5 ml of malarial blood directly into the frontal lobes of over 100 paretic patients through holes drilled into the skull. He claimed that the injected paretics showed signs of &quot;uncontestable mental and physical amelioration&quot; and that the results for psychotic patients undergoing the procedure were also &quot;encouraging&quot;. The experimental injection of fever-inducing malarial blood into the frontal lobes was also replicated during the 1930s in the work of Ettore Mariotti and M. Sciutti in Italy and Ferdière Coulloudon in France. In Switzerland, almost simultaneously with the commencement of Moniz&#x27;s leucotomy programme, the neurosurgeon François Ody had removed the entire right frontal lobe of a catatonic schizophrenic patient. In Romania, Ody&#x27;s procedure was adopted by Dimitri Bagdasar and Constantinesco working out of the Central Hospital in Bucharest. Ody, who delayed publishing his own results for several years, later rebuked Moniz for claiming to have cured patients through leucotomy without waiting to determine if there had been a &quot;lasting remission&quot;.

====Neurological model====

The theoretical underpinnings of Moniz&#x27;s psychosurgery were largely commensurate with the nineteenth-century ones that had informed Burckhardt&#x27;s decision to excise matter from the brains of his patients. Although in his later writings, Moniz referenced both the neuron theory of Ramón y Cajal and the conditioned reflex of Ivan Pavlov, in essence he simply interpreted this new neurological research in terms of the old psychological theory of associationism. He differed significantly from Burckhardt, however in that he did not think there was any organic pathology in the brains of the mentally ill, but rather that their neural pathways were caught in fixed and destructive circuits leading to &quot;predominant, obsessive ideas&quot;. As Moniz wrote in 1936:
[The] mental troubles must have ... a relation with the formation of cellulo-connective groupings, which become more or less fixed. The cellular bodies may remain altogether normal, their cylinders will not have any anatomical alterations; but their multiple liaisons, very variable in normal people, may have arrangements more or less fixed, which will have a relation with persistent ideas and deliria in certain morbid psychic states.

For Moniz, &quot;to cure these patients&quot;, it was necessary to &quot;destroy the more or less fixed arrangements of cellular connections that exist in the brain, and particularly those which are related to the frontal lobes&quot;, thus removing their fixed pathological brain circuits. Moniz believed the brain would functionally adapt to such injury. Unlike the position adopted by Burckhardt, it was unfalsifiable according to the knowledge and technology of the time as the absence of a known correlation between physical brain pathology and mental illness could not disprove his thesis.

====First leucotomies====

On 12 November 1935 at the Hospital de Santa Marta in Lisbon, Moniz initiated the first of a series of operations on the brains of people with mental illnesses. The initial patients selected for the operation were provided by the medical director of Lisbon&#x27;s Miguel Bombarda Mental Hospital, José de Matos Sobral Cid. As Moniz lacked training in neurosurgery and his hands were impaired by gout, the procedure was performed under general anaesthetic by Pedro Almeida Lima, who had previously assisted Moniz with his research on cerebral angiography. The intention was to remove some of the long fibres that connected the frontal lobes to other major brain centres. To this end, it was decided that Lima would trephine into the side of the skull and then inject ethanol into the &quot;subcortical white matter of the prefrontal area&quot; so as to destroy the connecting fibres, or association tracts, and create what Moniz termed a &quot;frontal barrier&quot;. After the first operation was complete, Moniz considered it a success and, observing that the patient&#x27;s depression had been relieved, he declared her &quot;cured&quot; although she was never, in fact, discharged from the mental hospital. Moniz and Lima persisted with this method of injecting alcohol into the frontal lobes for the next seven patients but, after having to inject some patients on numerous occasions to elicit what they considered a favourable result, they modified the means by which they would section the frontal lobes. For the ninth patient they introduced a surgical instrument called a leucotome; this was a cannula that was in length and in diameter. It had a retractable wire loop at one end that, when rotated, produced a diameter circular lesion in the white matter of the frontal lobe. Typically, six lesions were cut into each lobe, but, if they were dissatisfied by the results, Lima might perform several procedures, each producing multiple lesions in the left and right frontal lobes.

By the conclusion of this first run of leucotomies in February 1936, Moniz and Lima had operated on twenty patients with an average period of one week between each procedure; Moniz published his findings with great haste in March of the same year. The patients were aged between 27 and 62 years of age; twelve were female and eight were male. Nine of the patients were diagnosed with depression, six with schizophrenia, two with panic disorder, and one each with mania, catatonia and manic-depression. Their most prominent symptoms were anxiety and agitation. The duration of their illness before the procedure varied from as little as four weeks to as much as 22 years, although all but four had been ill for at least one year. Patients were normally operated on the day they arrived at Moniz&#x27;s clinic and returned within ten days to the Miguel Bombarda Mental Hospital. A perfunctory post-operative follow-up assessment took place anywhere from one to ten weeks following surgery. Complications were observed in each of the leucotomy patients and included: &quot;increased temperature, vomiting, bladder and bowel incontinence, diarrhea, and ocular affections such as ptosis and nystagmus, as well as psychological effects such as apathy, akinesia, lethargy, timing, and local disorientation, kleptomania, and abnormal sensations of hunger&quot;. Moniz asserted that these effects were transitory and, according to his published assessment, the outcome for these first twenty patients was that 35%, or seven cases, improved significantly, another 35% were somewhat improved and the remaining 30% (six cases) were unchanged. There were no deaths and he did not consider that any patients had deteriorated following leucotomy.

==Reception==

Moniz rapidly disseminated his results through articles in the medical press and a monograph in 1936. Initially, however, the medical community appeared hostile to the new procedure. On 26 July 1936, one of his assistants, Diogo Furtado, gave a presentation at the Parisian meeting of the Société Médico-Psychologique on the results of the second cohort of patients leucotomised by Lima. Sobral Cid, who had supplied Moniz with the first set of patients for leucotomy from his own hospital in Lisbon, attended the meeting and denounced the technique, declaring that the patients who had been returned to his care post-operatively were &quot;diminished&quot; and had experienced a &quot;degradation of personality&quot;. He also claimed that the changes Moniz observed in patients were more properly attributed to shock and brain trauma, and he derided the theoretical architecture that Moniz had constructed to support the new procedure as &quot;cerebral mythology.&quot; At the same meeting the Parisian psychiatrist, Paul Courbon, stated he could not endorse a surgical technique that was solely supported by theoretical considerations rather than clinical observations. He also opined that the mutilation of an organ could not improve its function and that such cerebral wounds as were occasioned by leucotomy risked the later development of meningitis, epilepsy and brain abscesses. Nonetheless, Moniz&#x27;s reported successful surgical treatment of 14 out of 20 patients led to the rapid adoption of the procedure on an experimental basis by individual clinicians in countries such as Brazil, Cuba, Italy, Romania and the United States during the 1930s.

=== Italian leucotomy ===

Throughout the remainder of the 1930s, the number of leucotomies performed in most countries where the technique was adopted remained quite low. In Britain, which was later a major centre for leucotomy, only six operations had been undertaken before 1942. Generally, medical practitioners who attempted the procedure adopted a cautious approach and few patients were leucotomised before the 1940s. Italian neuropsychiatrists, who were typically early and enthusiastic adopters of leucotomy, were exceptional in eschewing such a gradualist course.

Leucotomy was first reported in the Italian medical press in 1936 and Moniz published an article in Italian on the technique in the following year. In 1937, he was invited to Italy to demonstrate the procedure and for two weeks in June of that year, he visited medical centres in Trieste, Ferrara, and one close to Turinthe Racconigi Hospitalwhere he instructed his Italian neuropsychiatric colleagues on leucotomy and also oversaw several operations. Leucotomy was featured at two Italian psychiatric conferences in 1937 and over the next two years a score of medical articles on Moniz&#x27;s psychosurgery was published by Italian clinicians based in medical institutions located in Racconigi, Trieste, Naples, Genoa, Milan, Pisa, Catania and Rovigo. The major centre for leucotomy in Italy was the Racconigi Hospital, where the experienced neurosurgeon Ludvig Puusepp provided a guiding hand. Under the medical directorship of Emilio Rizzatti, the medical personnel at this hospital had completed at least 200 leucotomies by 1939. Reports from clinicians based at other Italian institutions detailed significantly fewer leucotomy operations.

Experimental modifications of Moniz&#x27;s operation were introduced with little delay by Italian medical practitioners. Most notably, in 1937 Amarro Fiamberti, the medical director of a psychiatric institution in Varese, first devised the transorbital procedure whereby the frontal lobes were accessed through the eye sockets. Fiamberti&#x27;s method was to puncture the thin layer of orbital bone at the top of the socket and then inject alcohol or formalin into the white matter of the frontal lobes through this aperture. Using this method, while sometimes substituting a leucotome for a hypodermic needle, it is estimated that he leucotomised about 100 patients in the period up to the outbreak of World War II. Fiamberti&#x27;s innovation of Moniz&#x27;s method would later prove inspirational for Walter Freeman&#x27;s development of transorbital lobotomy.

===American leucotomy===

The first prefrontal leucotomy in the United States was performed at the George Washington University Hospital, on 14 September 1936, by the neurologist Walter Freeman, and his friend and colleague, the neurosurgeon James W. Watts. Freeman had first encountered Moniz at the London-hosted Second International Congress of Neurology in 1935, where he had presented a poster exhibit of the Portuguese neurologist&#x27;s work on cerebral angiography. Fortuitously occupying a booth next to Moniz, Freeman, delighted by their chance meeting, formed a highly favourable impression of Moniz, later remarking upon his &quot;sheer genius&quot;. According to Freeman, if they had not met in person, it is highly unlikely that he would have ventured into the domain of frontal lobe psychosurgery. Freeman&#x27;s interest in psychiatry was the natural outgrowth of his appointment in 1924 as the medical director of the Research Laboratories of the Government Hospital for the Insane in Washington, known colloquially as St Elizabeth&#x27;s. Freeman, who favoured an organic model of mental illness causation, spent the next several years exhaustively, yet ultimately fruitlessly, investigating a neuropathological basis for insanity. Chancing upon a preliminary communication by Moniz on leucotomy in the spring of 1936, Freeman initiated a correspondence in May of that year. Writing that he had been considering psychiatric brain surgery previously, he informed Moniz that, &quot;having your authority I expect to go ahead&quot;. Moniz, in return, promised to send him a copy of his forthcoming monograph on leucotomy and urged him to purchase a leucotome from a French supplier.

Upon receipt of Moniz&#x27;s monograph, Freeman reviewed it anonymously for the &quot;Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry&quot;. Praising the text as one whose &quot;importance can scarcely be overestimated&quot;, he summarised Moniz&#x27;s rationale for the procedure as based on the fact that while no physical abnormality of cerebral cell bodies was observable in the mentally ill, their cellular interconnections may harbour a &quot;fixation of certain patterns of relationship among various groups of cells&quot; and that this resulted in obsessions, delusions and mental morbidity. While recognising that Moniz&#x27;s thesis was inadequate, for Freeman it had the advantage of circumventing the search for diseased brain tissue in the mentally ill by instead suggesting that the problem was a functional one of the brain&#x27;s internal wiring where relief might be obtained by severing problematic mental circuits.

In 1937 Freeman and Watts adapted Lima and Moniz&#x27;s surgical procedure, and created the &quot;Freeman-Watts technique&quot;, also known as the &quot;Freeman-Watts standard prefrontal lobotomy,&quot; which they styled the &quot;precision method&quot;.

===Transorbital lobotomy===
The Freeman–Watts prefrontal lobotomy still required drilling holes in the skull, so surgery had to be performed in an operating room by trained neurosurgeons. Walter Freeman believed this surgery would be unavailable to those he saw as needing it most: patients in state mental hospitals that had no operating rooms, surgeons, or anesthesia and limited budgets. Freeman wanted to simplify the procedure so that it could be carried out by psychiatrists in psychiatric hospitals.

Inspired by the work of Italian psychiatrist Amarro Fiamberti, Freeman at some point conceived of approaching the frontal lobes through the eye sockets instead of through drilled holes in the skull. In 1945 he took an icepick from his own kitchen and began testing the idea on grapefruit and cadavers. 

The use of lobotomy in the United States was resisted and criticized heavily by American neurosurgeons. However, because Freeman managed to promote the success of the surgery through the media, lobotomy became touted as a miracle procedure, capturing the attention of the public and leading to an overwhelming demand for the operation. In 1945 Freeman streamlined the procedure, replacing it with transorbital lobotomy, in which a picklike instrument was forced through the back of the eye sockets to pierce the thin bone that separates the eye sockets from the frontal lobes. The pick’s point was then inserted into the frontal lobe and used to sever connections in the brain (presumably between the prefrontal cortex and thalamus). In 1946 Freeman performed this procedure for the first time on a patient, who was subdued prior to the operation with electroshock treatment.

The transorbital lobotomy procedure, which Freeman performed very quickly, sometimes in less than 10 minutes, was used on many patients with relatively minor mental disorders that Freeman believed did not warrant traditional lobotomy surgery, in which the skull itself was opened. A large proportion of such lobotomized patients exhibited reduced tension or agitation, but many also showed other effects, such as apathy, passivity, lack of initiative, poor ability to concentrate, and a generally decreased depth and intensity of their emotional response to life. Some died as a result of the procedure. However, those effects were not widely reported in the 1940s, and at that time the long-term effects were largely unknown. Because the procedure met with seemingly widespread success, Moniz was awarded the 1949 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine (along with Swiss physiologist Walter Rudolf Hess).

Lobotomies were performed on a wide scale during the 1940s; Freeman himself performed or supervised more than 3,500 lobotomies by the late 1960s. Freeman performed his first transorbital lobotomy on Ellen Ionesco, a woman who suffered from bouts of manic depression and suicidal ideation. Freeman utilized media coverage and penned editorials for numerous interviews promoting the procedure and achieving accolades for his work in psychiatric care.

Watts did not favor the transorbital method, and this difference of opinion contributed to the end of their partnership. Watts resisted the technique itself, Freeman&#x27;s lack of sterile technique when performing it, and the idea of performing the procedure in an outpatient setting. Watts recalled that the hospital reprimanded Freeman, stating that he was “not a surgeon and if he wants to operate he’ll have to apply for surgical privileges.” 

Freeman performed the first transorbital lobotomy on a live patient in 1946. Its simplicity suggested the possibility of carrying it out in mental hospitals lacking the surgical facilities required for the earlier, more complex procedure. (Freeman suggested that, where conventional anesthesia was unavailable, electroconvulsive therapy be used to render the patient unconscious.) In 1947, the Freeman and Watts partnership ended, as the latter was disgusted by Freeman&#x27;s barbarism and neglectful modifications of the lobotomy from a surgical operation into a simple &quot;office&quot; procedure. Between 1940 and 1944, 684 lobotomies were performed in the United States. However, because of the fervent promotion of the technique by Freeman and Watts, those numbers increased sharply toward the end of the decade. In 1949, the peak year for lobotomies in the US, 5,074 procedures were undertaken, and by 1951 over 18,608 individuals had been lobotomized in the US.

== Prevalence ==
In the United States, approximately 40,000 people were lobotomized and in England, 17,000 lobotomies were performed. According to one estimate, in the three Nordic countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, a combined figure of approximately 9,300 lobotomies were performed. Scandinavian hospitals lobotomized 2.5 times as many people per capita as hospitals in the US. According to another estimate, Sweden lobotomized at least 4,500 people between 1944 and 1966, mainly women. This figure includes young children. And in Norway, there were 2,005 known lobotomies. In Denmark, there were 4,500 known lobotomies. In Japan, the majority of lobotomies were performed on children with behaviour problems. The Soviet Union banned the practice in 1950 on moral grounds. In Germany, it was performed only a few times. By the late 1970s, the practice of lobotomy had generally ceased, although it continued as late as the 1980s in France.

==Criticism==
As early as 1944, an author in the &quot;Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease&quot; remarked: &quot;The history of prefrontal lobotomy has been brief and stormy. Its course has been dotted with both violent opposition and with slavish, unquestioning acceptance.&quot; Beginning in 1947 Swedish psychiatrist Snorre Wohlfahrt evaluated early trials, reporting that it is &quot;distinctly hazardous to leucotomize schizophrenics&quot; and that lobotomy was &quot;still too imperfect to enable us, with its aid, to venture on a general offensive against chronic cases of mental disorder&quot;, stating further that &quot;Psychosurgery has as yet failed to discover its precise indications and contraindications and the methods must unfortunately still be regarded as rather crude and hazardous in many respects.&quot; In 1948 Norbert Wiener, the author of &quot;&quot;, said: &quot;Prefrontal lobotomy... has recently been having a certain vogue, probably not unconnected with the fact that it makes the custodial care of many patients easier. Let me remark in passing that killing them makes their custodial care still easier.&quot;

Concerns about lobotomy steadily grew. Soviet psychiatrist Vasily Gilyarovsky criticized lobotomy and the mechanistic brain localization assumption used to carry out lobotomy:

The Soviet Union officially banned the procedure in 1950 on the initiative of Gilyarovsky. Doctors in the Soviet Union concluded that the procedure was &quot;contrary to the principles of humanity&quot; and through lobotomy&#x27; an insane person is changed into an idiot&quot;. By the 1970s, numerous countries had banned the procedure, as had several US states.

In 1977, the US Congress, during the presidency of Jimmy Carter, created the National Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research to investigate allegations that psychosurgeryincluding lobotomy techniqueswas used to control minorities and restrain individual rights. The committee concluded that some extremely limited and properly performed psychosurgery could have positive effects.

Torsten Wiesel has called the award of the Nobel Prize to Moniz an &quot;astounding [error] of judgment... a terrible mistake&quot;, and there have been calls for the Nobel Foundation to rescind the award; the Foundation has not done so, and its website still hosts an article defending lobotomy.

==Notable cases==

* Rosemary Kennedy, sister of US president John F. Kennedy, underwent a lobotomy in 1941 that left her incapacitated and institutionalized for the rest of her life.
* Howard Dully wrote a memoir of his late-life discovery that he had been lobotomized in 1960 at age 12.
* Josef Hassid, a Polish violinist and composer, was diagnosed with schizophrenia and died at the age of 26 following a lobotomy performed on him in England.
* Swedish modernist painter Sigrid Hjertén died following a lobotomy in 1948.
* American playwright Tennessee Williams&#x27; older sister Rose received a lobotomy that left her incapacitated for life; the episode is said to have inspired characters and motifs in some of his works.
* It is often said that when an iron rod was accidentally driven through the head of Phineas Gage in 1848, this constituted an &quot;accidental lobotomy&quot;, or that this event somehow inspired the development of surgical lobotomy a century later. According to the only book-length study of Gage, careful inquiry turns up no such link.
* In 2011, Daniel Nijensohn, an Argentine-born neurosurgeon at Yale, examined X-rays of Eva Perón and concluded that she underwent a lobotomy for the treatment of pain and anxiety in the last months of her life.

==Literary and cinematic portrayals==

Lobotomies have been featured in several literary and cinematic presentations that both reflected society&#x27;s attitude toward the procedure and, at times, changed it. Writers and filmmakers have played a pivotal role in turning public sentiment against the procedure.
* Robert Penn Warren&#x27;s 1946 novel &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; describes a lobotomy as making &quot;a Comanche brave look like a tyro with a scalping knife&quot;, and portrays the surgeon as a repressed man who cannot change others with love, so he instead resorts to &quot;high-grade carpentry work&quot;.

* Tennessee Williams criticized lobotomy in his play &quot;Suddenly, Last Summer&quot; (1958) because it was sometimes inflicted on homosexualsto render them &quot;morally sane&quot;. In the play, a wealthy matriarch offers the local mental hospital a substantial donation if the hospital will give her niece a lobotomy, which she hopes will stop the niece&#x27;s shocking revelations about her son. Warned that a lobotomy might not stop her niece&#x27;s &quot;babbling&quot;, she responds, &quot;That may be, maybe not, but after the operation, who would &quot;believe&quot; her, Doctor?&quot;.

* In Ken Kesey&#x27;s 1962 novel &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; and its 1975 film adaptation, lobotomy is described as &quot;frontal-lobe castration&quot;, a form of punishment and control after which &quot;There&#x27;s nothin&#x27; in the face. Just like one of those store dummies.&quot; In one patient, &quot;You can see by his eyes how they burned him out over there; his eyes are all smoked up and gray and deserted inside.&quot;

* In Sylvia Plath&#x27;s 1963 novel &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;, the protagonist reacts with horror to the &quot;perpetual marble calm&quot; of a lobotomized young woman.

* Elliott Baker&#x27;s 1964 novel and 1966 film version, &quot;A Fine Madness&quot;, portrays the dehumanizing lobotomy of a womanizing, quarrelsome poet who, afterward, is just as aggressive as ever. The surgeon is depicted as an inhumane crackpot.

* The 1982 biopic film &quot;Frances&quot; depicts actress Frances Farmer (the subject of the film) undergoing transorbital lobotomy (though the idea that a lobotomy was performed on Farmer, and that Freeman performed it, has been criticized as having little or no factual foundation).

* The 2018 film &quot;The Mountain&quot; centers on lobotomy, attitudes about mental health in general, in 1950s America. The protagonist, a young man whose mother had been lobotomized, takes a job as a medical photographer for a doctor whose character is loosely based on Freeman.

<text>Tillage is the agricultural preparation of soil by mechanical of various types, such as digging, stirring, and overturning. Examples of human-powered tilling methods using hand tools include shoveling, picking, mattock work, hoeing, and raking. Examples of draft-animal-powered or mechanized work include ploughing (overturning with moldboards or chiseling with chisel shanks), rototilling, rolling with cultipackers or other rollers, harrowing, and cultivating with cultivator shanks (teeth).

Tillage that is deeper and more thorough is classified as primary, and tillage that is shallower and sometimes more selective of location is secondary. Primary tillage such as ploughing tends to produce a rough surface finish, whereas secondary tillage tends to produce a smoother surface finish, such as that required to make a good seedbed for many crops. Harrowing and rototilling often combine primary and secondary tillage into one operation.

&quot;Tillage&quot; can also mean the land that is tilled. The word &quot;cultivation&quot; has several senses that overlap substantially with those of &quot;tillage&quot;. In a general context, both can refer to agriculture. Within agriculture, both can refer to any kind of soil agitation. Additionally, &quot;cultivation&quot; or &quot;cultivating&quot; may refer to an even narrower sense of shallow, selective secondary tillage of row crop fields that kills weeds while sparing the crop plants.

==Definitions==
&quot;Primary tillage&quot; loosens the soil and mixes in fertilizer or plant material, resulting in soil with a rough texture.

&quot;Secondary tillage&quot; produces finer soil and sometimes shapes the rows, preparing the seed bed. It also provides weed control throughout the growing season during the maturation of the crop plants, unless such weed control is instead achieved with low-till or no-till methods involving herbicides.
* The seedbed preparation can be done with harrows (of which there are many types and subtypes), dibbles, hoes, shovels, rotary tillers, subsoilers, ridge- or bed-forming tillers, rollers, or cultivators.
* The weed control, to the extent that it is done via tillage, is usually achieved with cultivators or hoes, which disturb the top few centimeters of soil around the crop plants but with minimal disturbance of the crop plants themselves. The tillage kills the weeds via two mechanisms: uprooting them, burying their leaves (cutting off their photosynthesis), or a combination of both. Weed control both prevents the crop plants from being outcompeted by the weeds (for water and sunlight) and prevents the weeds from reaching their seed stage, thus reducing future weed population aggressiveness.

==History==

Tilling was first performed via human labor, sometimes involving slaves. Hoofed animals could also be used to till soil by trampling, in addition to pigs, whose natural instincts are to root the ground regularly if allowed to. The wooden plow was then invented. (&quot;It is difficult to pinpoint the exact date of its invention&quot;. &quot;However, the earliest evidence of plow usage dates back to around 4000 BCE in Mesopotamia&quot; (&quot;modern-day Iraq&quot;) . It could be pulled with human labor, or by mule, ox, elephant, water buffalo, or a similar sturdy animal. Horses are generally unsuitable, though breeds such as the Clydesdale were bred as draft animals.

Tilling could at times be very labor-intensive. This aspect is discussed in the 16th-century French agronomic text written by Charles Estienne:

The popularity of tillage as an agricultural technique in early modern times had to do with theories about plant biology proposed by European thinkers. In 1731, English writer Jethro Tull published the book &quot;Horse-Hoeing Husbandry: An Essay on the Principles of Vegetation and Tillage,&quot; which argued that soil needed to be pulverized into fine powder for plants to make use of it. Tull believed that, since water, air, and heat were clearly not the primary substance of a plant, plants were made of earth, and thus had to consume very small pieces of earth as food. Tull wrote that each subsequent tillage of the soil would increase its fertility, and that it was impossible to till the soil too much. However, scientific observation has shown that the opposite is true; tillage causes soil to lose structural qualities that allow plant roots, water, and nutrients to penetrate it, accelerates soil loss by erosion, and results in soil compaction.

The steel plow allowed farming in the American Midwest, where tough prairie grasses and rocks caused trouble. Soon after 1900, the farm tractor was introduced, which made modern large-scale agriculture possible. However, the destruction of the prairie grasses and tillage of the fertile topsoil of the American Midwest caused the Dust Bowl, in which the soil was blown away and stirred up into dust storms that blackened the sky. This prompted re-consideration of tillage techniques, but in the United States as of 2019, 3 trillion pounds of soil were estimated to be lost due to erosion while adoption of improved techniques for controlling erosion are still not widespread. In the mid-1930s Frank and Herbert Petty of Doncaster, Victoria, Australia developed the Petty Plough. This steerable plough could be pulled by either two horses or a tractor and the disc wheels could be steered in unison, or separately allowing the operator to plough the center of rows as well as between and around orchard trees.

==Types==
===Primary and secondary tillage ===
Primary tillage is usually conducted after the last harvest, when the soil is wet enough to allow plowing but also allows good traction. Some soil types can be plowed dry. The objective of primary tillage is to attain a reasonable depth of soft soil, incorporate crop residues, kill weeds, and to aerate the soil. Secondary tillage is any subsequent tillage, to incorporate fertilizers, reduce the soil to a finer tilth, level the surface, or control weeds.

===Reduced tillage===

Reduced tillage leaves between 15 and 30% crop residue cover on the soil or 500 to 1000 pounds per acre (560 to 1100 kg/ha) of small grain residue during the critical erosion period. This may involve the use of a chisel plow, field cultivators, or other implements. See the general comments below to see how they can affect the amount of residue.

===Intensive tillage===
Intensive tillage leaves less than 15% crop residue cover or less than 500 pounds per acre (560 kg/ha) of small grain residue. This type of tillage is often referred to as conventional tillage, but as conservational tillage is now more widely used than intensive tillage (in the United States), it is often not appropriate to refer to this type of tillage as conventional. Intensive tillage often involves multiple operations with implements such as a mold board, disk, or chisel plow. After this, a finisher with a harrow, rolling basket, and cutter can be used to prepare the seed bed. There are many variations.

===Conservation tillage===
Conservation tillage leaves at least 30% of crop residue on the soil surface, or at least 1,000 lb/ac (1,100 kg/ha) of small grain residue on the surface during the critical soil erosion period. This slows water movement, which reduces the amount of soil erosion. Additionally, conservation tillage has been found to benefit predatory arthropods that can enhance pest control. Conservation tillage also benefits farmers by reducing fuel consumption and soil compaction. By reducing the number of times the farmer travels over the field, significant savings in fuel and labor are made.

Conservation tillage is used on over 370 million acres, mostly in South America, Oceania and North America. In most years since 1997, conservation tillage was used in US cropland more than intensive or reduced tillage.

However, conservation tillage delays warming of the soil due to the reduction of dark earth exposure to the warmth of the spring sun, thus delaying the planting of the next year&#x27;s spring crop of corn.

* No-till – plows, disks, et cetera are not used. Aims for 100% ground cover.
* Strip-till – Narrow strips are tilled where seeds will be planted, leaving the soil in between the rows untilled.
* Mulch-till - Soil is covered with mulch to conserve heat and moisture. 100% soil disturbance.
* Rotational tillage – Tilling the soil every two years or less often (every other year, or every third year, etc.).
* Ridge-till

===Zone tillage===
Zone tillage is a form of modified deep tillage in which only narrow strips are tilled, leaving soil in between the rows untilled. This type of tillage agitates the soil to help reduce soil compaction problems and to improve internal soil drainage. It is designed to only disrupt the soil in a narrow strip directly below the crop row. In comparison to no-till, which relies on the previous year&#x27;s plant residue to protect the soil and aids in postponement of the warming of the soil and crop growth in Northern climates, zone tillage produces a strip approximately five inches wide that simultaneously breaks up plow pans, assists in warming the soil and helps to prepare a seedbed. When combined with cover crops, zone tillage helps replace lost organic matter, slows the deterioration of the soil, improves soil drainage, increases soil water and nutrient holding capacity, and allows necessary soil organisms to survive.

It has been successfully used on farms in the Midwest and West of the US for over 40 years, and is currently used on more than 36% of the U.S. farmland. Some specific states where zone tillage is currently in practice are Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Minnesota, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Illinois.

Its use in the USA&#x27;s Northern Corn Belt states lacks consistent yield results; however, there is still interest in deep tillage within agriculture. In areas that are not well-drained, deep tillage may be used as an alternative to installing more expensive tile drainage.

==Effects==
=== Positive ===
Plowing:
* Loosens and aerates the top layer of soil or horizon A, which facilitates planting the crop.
* Helps mix harvest residue, organic matter (humus), and nutrients evenly into the soil.
* Mechanically destroys weeds.
* Dries the soil before seeding (in wetter climates, tillage aids in keeping the soil drier).
* When done in autumn, helps exposed soil crumble over winter through frosting and defrosting, which helps prepare a smooth surface for spring planting.
* Can reduce infestations of slugs, cut worms, army worms, and harmful insects as they are attracted by leftover residues from former crops.
* Reduces the risk of crop diseases which can be harbored in surface residues.

===Negative===

* Dries the soil before seeding.
* Soil loses nutrients, like nitrogen and fertilizer, and its ability to store water.
* Decreases the water infiltration rate of soil. (Results in more runoff and erosion as the soil absorbs water more slowly than before)
* Tilling the soil results in dislodging the cohesiveness of the soil particles, thereby inducing erosion.
* Chemical runoff.
* Reduces organic matter in the soil.
* Reduces microbes, earthworms, ants, etc.
* Destroys soil aggregates.
* Compaction of the soil, also known as a tillage pan.
* Eutrophication (nutrient runoff into a body of water).

===Archaeology===
Tilling can damage ancient structures such as long barrows. In the UK, half of the long barrows in Gloucestershire and almost all the burial mounds in Essex have been damaged. According to English Heritage in 2003, ploughing with modern powerful tractors had done as much damage in the last six decades as traditional farming did in the previous six centuries.

==General comments==
* The type of implement makes the most difference, although other factors can have an effect.
* Tilling in absolute darkness (night tillage) might reduce the number of weeds that sprout following the tilling operation by half. Light is necessary to break the dormancy of some weed species&#x27; seed, so if fewer seeds are exposed to light during the tilling process, fewer will sprout. This may help reduce the amount of herbicides needed for weed control.
* Greater speeds, when using certain tillage implements (disks and chisel plows), lead to more intensive tillage (i.e., less residue is on the soil surface).
* Increasing the angle of disks causes residues to be buried more deeply. Increasing their concavity makes them more aggressive.
* Chisel plows can have spikes or sweeps. Spikes are more aggressive.
* Percentage residue is used to compare tillage systems because the amount of crop residue affects the soil loss due to erosion.

==Alternatives==
Modern agricultural science has greatly reduced the use of tillage. Crops can be grown for several years without any tillage through the use of herbicides to control weeds, crop varieties that tolerate packed soil, and equipment that can plant seeds or fumigate the soil without really digging it up. This practice, called no-till farming, reduces costs and environmental change by reducing soil erosion and diesel fuel usage.

==Site preparation of forest land==

Site preparation is any of the various treatments applied to a site to ready it for seeding or planting. The purpose is to facilitate the regeneration of that site by the chosen method. Site preparation may be designed to achieve, singly or in any combination, improved access by reducing or rearranging slash and ameliorating adverse forest floor, soil, vegetation, or other biotic factors. Site preparation is undertaken to ameliorate one or more constraints that would otherwise be likely to thwart management objectives. A valuable bibliography on the effects of soil temperature and site preparation on subalpine and boreal tree species has been prepared by McKinnon et al. (2002).

Site preparation is the work that is done before a forest area is regenerated. Some types of site preparation are burning.

===Burning===
Broadcast burning is commonly used to prepare clearcut sites for planting, e.g., in central British Columbia, and in the temperate region of North America generally.

Prescribed burning is carried out primarily for slash hazard reduction and to improve site conditions for regeneration; all or some of the following benefits may accrue:

:a) Reduction of logging slash, plant competition, and humus prior to direct seeding, planting, scarifying or in anticipation of natural seeding in partially cut stands or in connection with seed-tree systems.

:b) Reduction or elimination of unwanted forest cover prior to planting or seeding, or prior to preliminary scarification thereto.

:c) Reduction of humus on cold, moist sites to favour regeneration.

:d) Reduction or elimination of slash, grass, or brush fuels from strategic areas around forested land to reduce the chances of damage by wildfire.

Prescribed burning for preparing sites for direct seeding was tried on a few occasions in Ontario, but none of the burns was hot enough to produce a seedbed that was adequate without supplementary mechanical site preparation.

Changes in soil chemical properties associated with burning include significantly increased pH, which Macadam (1987) in the Sub-boreal Spruce Zone of central British Columbia found persisting more than a year after the burn. Average fuel consumption was 20 to 24 t/ha and the forest floor depth was reduced by 28% to 36%. The increases correlated well with the amounts of slash (both total and ≥7 cm diameter) consumed. The change in pH depends on the severity of the burn and the amount consumed; the increase can be as much as 2 units, a 100-fold change. Deficiencies of copper and iron in the foliage of white spruce on burned clearcuts in central British Columbia might be attributable to elevated pH levels.

Even a broadcast slash fire in a clearcut does not give a uniform burn over the whole area. Tarrant (1954), for instance, found only 4% of a 140-ha slash burn had burned severely, 47% had burned lightly, and 49% was unburned. Burning after windrowing obviously accentuates the subsequent heterogeneity.

Marked increases in exchangeable calcium also correlated with the amount of slash at least 7 cm in diameter consumed. Phosphorus availability also increased, both in the forest floor and in the 0 cm to 15 cm mineral soil layer, and the increase was still evident, albeit somewhat diminished, 21 months after burning. However, in another study in the same Sub-boreal Spruce Zone found that although it increased immediately after the burn, phosphorus availability had dropped to below pre-burn levels within 9 months.

Nitrogen will be lost from the site by burning, though concentrations in remaining forest floor were found by Macadam (1987) to have increased in two out of six plots, the others showing decreases. Nutrient losses may be outweighed, at least in the short term, by improved soil microclimate through the reduced thickness of forest floor where low soil temperatures are a limiting factor.

The &quot;Picea/Abies&quot; forests of the Alberta foothills are often characterized by deep accumulations of organic matter on the soil surface and cold soil temperatures, both of which make reforestation difficult and result in a general deterioration in site productivity; Endean and Johnstone (1974) describe experiments to test prescribed burning as a means of seedbed preparation and site amelioration on representative clear-felled &quot;Picea/Abies&quot; areas. Results showed that, in general, prescribed burning did not reduce organic layers satisfactorily, nor did it increase soil temperature, on the sites tested. Increases in seedling establishment, survival, and growth on the burned sites were probably the result of slight reductions in the depth of the organic layer, minor increases in soil temperature, and marked improvements in the efficiency of the planting crews. Results also suggested that the process of site deterioration has not been reversed by the burning treatments applied.

===Ameliorative intervention===
Slash weight (the oven-dry weight of the entire crown and that portion of the stem less than four inches in diameter) and size distribution are major factors influencing the forest fire hazard on harvested sites. Forest managers interested in the application of prescribed burning for hazard reduction and silviculture, were shown a method for quantifying the slash load by Kiil (1968). In west-central Alberta, he felled, measured, and weighed 60 white spruce, graphed (a) slash weight per merchantable unit volume against diameter at breast height (dbh), and (b) weight of fine slash (&lt;1.27 cm) also against dbh, and produced a table of slash weight and size distribution on one acre of a hypothetical stand of white spruce. When the diameter distribution of a stand is unknown, an estimate of slash weight and size distribution can be obtained from average stand diameter, number of trees per unit area, and merchantable cubic foot volume. The sample trees in Kiil&#x27;s study had full symmetrical crowns. Densely growing trees with short and often irregular crowns would probably be overestimated; open-grown trees with long crowns would probably be underestimated.

The need to provide shade for young outplants of Engelmann spruce in the high Rocky Mountains is emphasized by the U.S. Forest Service. Acceptable planting spots are defined as microsites on the north and east sides of down logs, stumps, or slash, and lying in the shadow cast by such material. Where the objectives of management specify more uniform spacing, or higher densities, than obtainable from an existing distribution of shade-providing material, redistribution or importing of such material has been undertaken.

===Access===
Site preparation on some sites might be done simply to facilitate access by planters, or to improve access and increase the number or distribution of microsites suitable for planting or seeding.

Wang et al. (2000) determined field performance of white and black spruces 8 and 9 years after outplanting on boreal mixedwood sites following site preparation (Donaren disc trenching versus no trenching) in 2 plantation types (open versus sheltered) in southeastern Manitoba. Donaren trenching slightly reduced the mortality of black spruce but significantly increased the mortality of white spruce. Significant difference in height was found between open and sheltered plantations for black spruce but not for white spruce, and root collar diameter in sheltered plantations was significantly larger than in open plantations for black spruce but not for white spruce. Black spruce open plantation had significantly smaller volume (97 cm3) compared with black spruce sheltered (210 cm3), as well as white spruce open (175 cm3) and sheltered (229 cm3) plantations. White spruce open plantations also had smaller volume than white spruce sheltered plantations. For transplant stock, strip plantations had a significantly higher volume (329 cm3) than open plantations (204 cm3). Wang et al. (2000) recommended that sheltered plantation site preparation should be used.

===Mechanical===
Up to 1970, no &quot;sophisticated&quot; site preparation equipment had become operational in Ontario, but the need for more efficacious and versatile equipment was increasingly recognized. By this time, improvements were being made to equipment originally developed by field staff, and field testing of equipment from other sources was increasing.

According to J. Hall (1970), in Ontario at least, the most widely used site preparation technique was post-harvest mechanical scarification by equipment front-mounted on a bulldozer (blade, rake, V-plow, or teeth), or dragged behind a tractor (Imsett or S.F.I. scarifier, or rolling chopper). Drag type units designed and constructed by Ontario&#x27;s Department of Lands and Forests used anchor chain or tractor pads separately or in combination, or were finned steel drums or barrels of various sizes and used in sets alone or combined with tractor pad or anchor chain units.

J. Hall&#x27;s (1970) report on the state of site preparation in Ontario noted that blades and rakes were found to be well suited to post-cut scarification in tolerant hardwood stands for natural regeneration of yellow birch. Plows were most effective for treating dense brush prior to planting, often in conjunction with a planting machine. Scarifying teeth, e.g., Young&#x27;s teeth, were sometimes used to prepare sites for planting, but their most effective use was found to be preparing sites for seeding, particularly in backlog areas carrying light brush and dense herbaceous growth. Rolling choppers found application in treating heavy brush but could be used only on stone-free soils. Finned drums were commonly used on jack pine–spruce cutovers on fresh brushy sites with a deep duff layer and heavy slash, and they needed to be teamed with a tractor pad unit to secure good distribution of the slash. The S.F.I. scarifier, after strengthening, had been &quot;quite successful&quot; for 2 years, promising trials were under way with the cone scarifier and barrel ring scarifier, and development had begun on a new flail scarifier for use on sites with shallow, rocky soils. Recognition of the need to become more effective and efficient in site preparation led the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests to adopt the policy of seeking and obtaining for field testing new equipment from Scandinavia and elsewhere that seemed to hold promise for Ontario conditions, primarily in the north. Thus, testing was begun of the Brackekultivator from Sweden and the Vako-Visko rotary furrower from Finland.

Site preparation treatments that create raised planting spots have commonly improved outplant performance on sites subject to low soil temperature and excess soil moisture. Mounding can certainly have a big influence on soil temperature. Draper et al. (1985), for instance, documented this as well as the effect it had on root growth of outplants (Table 30).

The mounds warmed up quickest, and at soil depths of 0.5 cm and 10 cm averaged 10 and 7 °C higher, respectively, than in the control. On sunny days, daytime surface temperature maxima on the mound and organic mat reached 25 °C to 60 °C, depending on soil wetness and shading. Mounds reached mean soil temperatures of 10 °C at 10 cm depth 5 days after planting, but the control did not reach that temperature until 58 days after planting. During the first growing season, mounds had 3 times as many days with a mean soil temperature greater than 10 °C than did the control microsites.

Draper et al.&#x27;s (1985) mounds received 5 times the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) summed over all sampled microsites throughout the first growing season; the control treatment consistently received about 14% of daily background PAR, while mounds received over 70%. By November, fall frosts had reduced shading, eliminating the differential. Quite apart from its effect on temperature, incident radiation is also important photosynthetically. The average control microsite was exposed to levels of light above the compensation point for only 3 hours, i.e., one-quarter of the daily light period, whereas mounds received light above the compensation point for 11 hours, i.e., 86% of the same daily period. Assuming that incident light in the 100–600 μE/m2/s intensity range is the most important for photosynthesis, the mounds received over 4 times the total daily light energy that reached the control microsites.

===Orientation of linear site preparation===
With linear site preparation, orientation is sometimes dictated by topography or other considerations, but the orientation can often be chosen. It can make a difference. A disk-trenching experiment in the Sub-boreal Spruce Zone in interior British Columbia investigated the effect on growth of young outplants (lodgepole pine) in 13 microsite planting positions: berm, hinge, and trench in each of north, south, east, and west aspects, as well as in untreated locations between the furrows. Tenth-year stem volumes of trees on south-, east-, and west-facing microsites were significantly greater than those of trees on north-facing and untreated microsites. However, planting spot selection was seen to be more important overall than trench orientation.

In a Minnesota study, the N–S strips accumulated more snow but snow melted faster than on E–W strips in the first year after felling. Snow-melt was faster on strips near the centre of the strip-felled area than on border strips adjoining the intact stand. The strips, 50 feet (15.24 m) wide, alternating with uncut strips 16 feet (4.88 m) wide, were felled in a &quot;Pinus resinosa&quot; stand, aged 90 to 100 years.

<text>A threshing machine or a thresher is a piece of farm equipment that separates grain seed from the stalks and husks. It does so by beating the plant to make the seeds fall out. Before such machines were developed, threshing was done by hand with flails: such hand threshing was very laborious and time-consuming, taking about one-quarter of agricultural labour by the 18th century. Mechanization of this process removed a substantial amount of drudgery from farm labour. The first threshing machine was invented circa 1786 by the Scottish engineer Andrew Meikle, and the subsequent adoption of such machines was one of the earlier examples of the mechanization of agriculture. During the 19th century, threshers and mechanical reapers and reaper-binders gradually became widespread and made grain production much less laborious.

Separate reaper-binders and threshers have largely been replaced by machines that combine all of their functions, that is combine harvesters or combines. However, the simpler machines remain important as appropriate technology in low-capital farming contexts, both in developing countries and in developed countries on small farms that strive for especially high levels of self-sufficiency. For example, pedal-powered threshers are a low-cost option, and some Amish sects use horse-drawn binders and old-style threshers.

As the verb &quot;&quot; is cognate with the verb &quot;&quot; (and synonymous in the grain-beating sense), the names thrashing machine and thrasher are (less common) alternate forms.

== Early social impacts ==

The Swing Riots in the UK were partly a result of the threshing machine. Following years of war, high taxes and low wages, farm labourers finally revolted in 1830. They had faced unemployment for years, due to the widespread introduction of the threshing machine and the policy of enclosing fields. No longer were thousands of men needed to tend the crops; a few would suffice. With fewer jobs, lower wages and no prospects, the threshing machine was the final straw; it would place them on the brink of starvation. The Swing Rioters smashed threshing machines and threatened farmers who had them. The riots were dealt with very harshly. Nine of the rioters were hanged and a further 450 were transported to Australia.

== Later adoption ==
Early threshing machines were hand-fed and horse-powered. Some were housed in a specially constructed building, a gin gang, which would be attached to a threshing barn. They were small by today&#x27;s standards and were about the size of an upright piano. Later machines were steam-powered, driven by a portable engine or traction engine. Isaiah Jennings, a skilled inventor, created a small thresher that does not harm the straw in the process. In 1834, John Avery and Hiram Abial Pitts devised significant improvements to a machine that automatically threshes and separates grain from the chaff, freeing farmers from a slow and laborious process. Avery and Pitts were granted United States patent #542 on December 29, 1837.

John Ridley, an Australian inventor, also developed a threshing machine in South Australia in 1843.

The 1881 &quot;Household Cyclopedia&quot; said of Meikle&#x27;s machine:

:&quot;Since the invention of this machine, Mr. Meikle and others have progressively introduced a variety of improvements, all tending to simplify the labour, and to augment the quantity of the work performed. When first erected, though the grain was equally well separated from the straw, yet as the whole of the straw, chaff, and grain, was indiscriminately thrown into a confused heap, the work could only with propriety be considered as half executed. By the addition of rakes, or shakers, and two pairs of fanners, all driven by the same machinery, the different processes of thrashing, shaking, and winnowing are now all at once performed, and the grain immediately prepared for the public market. When it is added, that the quantity of grain gained from the superior powers of the machine is fully equal to a twentieth part of the crop, and that, in some cases, the expense of thrashing and cleaning the grain is considerably less than what was formerly paid for cleaning it alone, the immense saving arising from the invention will at once be seen.&quot;

:&quot;The expense of horse labour, from the increased value of the animal and the charge of his keeping, being an object of great importance, it is recommended that, upon all sizable farms, that is to say, where two hundred acres [800,000 m²], or upwards, of grain are sown, the machine should be worked by wind, unless where local circumstances afford the conveniency of water. Where coals are plenty and cheap, steam may be advantageously used for working the machine.&quot;

Steam-powered machines used belts connected to a traction engine; often both engine and thresher belonged to a contractor who toured the farms of a district. Steam remained a viable commercial option until the early post-WWII years.
== Modern developments ==

===In Europe and Americas===

Modern-day combines harvesters (or simply combines) operate on the same principles and use the same components as the original threshing machines built in the 19th century. Combines also perform the reaping operation at the same time. The name &quot;combine&quot; is derived from the fact that the two steps are combined in a single machine. Also, most modern combines are self-powered (usually by a diesel engine) and self-propelled, although tractor-powered, pull-type combines models were offered by John Deere and Case International into the 1990s.

Today, as in the 19th century, threshing begins with a cylinder and concave. The cylinder has sharp serrated bars, and rotates at high speed (about 500 RPM) so that the bars beat against the entire plant as it is mechanically fed from the reaping equipment at the front of the combine to the gap between the concave and the rotating beater/cylinder. The concave is curved to match the curve of the cylinder, and the grain, now separated from the plant stalks falls immediately through grated openings in the concave as it is beaten. The motion of the rotating cylinder thrusts the remaining straw and chaff toward the rear of the machine.

Whilst the majority of the grain falls through the concave, the straw is carried by a set of &quot;walkers&quot; to the rear of the machine, allowing any grain and chaff still in the straw to fall below. Below the straw walkers, a fan blows a stream of air across the grain, removing dust and small bits of crushed plant material out of the back of the combine. The residues fall to the ground and occasionally are collected for other purposes, such as fodder.

The grain, either coming through the concave or the walkers, meets a set of sieves mounted on an assembly called a shoe, which is shaken mechanically. The top sieve has larger openings and serves to remove large pieces of chaff from the grain. The lower sieve separates clean grain, which falls through, from incompletely threshed pieces. The incompletely threshed grain is returned to the cylinder by means of a system of conveyors, where the process repeats.

Some threshing machines were equipped with a bagger, which invariably held two bags, one being filled, and the other being replaced with an empty. A worker called a &quot;sewer&quot; removed and replaced the bags, and sewed full bags shut with a needle and thread. Other threshing machines would discharge grain from a conveyor, for bagging by hand. Combines are equipped with a grain tank, which accumulates grain for deposit in a truck or wagon.

A large amount of chaff and straw would accumulate around a threshing machine, and several innovations, such as the air chaffer, were developed to deal with this. Combines generally chop and disperse straw as they move through the field, though the chopping is disabled when the straw is to be baled, and chaff collectors are sometimes used to prevent the dispersal of weed seed throughout a field.

The corn sheller was almost identical in design, with slight modifications to deal with the larger kernel size and presence of cobs. Modern-day combines can be adjusted to work with any grain crop and many unusual seed crops.

Both the older and modern machines require a good deal of effort to operate. The concave clearance, cylinder speed, fan velocity, sieve sizes, and feeding rate must be adjusted for crop conditions.

===Another development in Asia===

From the early 20th century, petrol or diesel-powered threshing machines, designed especially to thresh rice, the most important crop in Asia, have been developed along different lines to the modern combine.

Even after the combine was invented and became popular, a new compact-size thresher called a &quot;harvester&quot;, with wheels, still remains in use and at present it is available from a Japanese agricultural manufacturer. The compact-size machine is very convenient to handle in small terrace fields in mountain areas where a large machine, such as a combine, is not usable.

People there use this harvester with a modern compact binder.

==Preservation==
A number of older threshing machines have survived into preservation. They are often to be seen in operation at live steam festivals and traction engine rallies such as the Great Dorset Steam Fair in England, and the Western Minnesota Steam Threshers Reunion in northwest Minnesota.

===Musical references===
Irish songwriter John Duggan immortalised the threshing machine in the song &quot;The Old Thrashing Mill&quot;. The song has been recorded by Foster and Allen and Brendan Shine.

On the Alan Lomax collection &quot;Songs of Seduction&quot; (Rounder Select, 2000), there is a bawdy Irish folk song called &quot;The Thrashing Machine&quot; sung by tinker Annie O&#x27;Neil, as recorded in the early 20th century.

In his film score for &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; (1939) and consequently in his collection &quot;Music for the Movies&quot; (1942), American composer Aaron Copland titled a section of the score &quot;Threshing Machines,&quot; to suit a scene in the Lewis Milestone film where Curley is threatening Slim over giving May a puppy, when many of the itinerant worker men are standing around or working on threshers.

In the song &quot;Thrasher&quot; from the album &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot;, Neil Young compares the modern threshing machine&#x27;s technique of separating wheat from wheat stalks to the natural forces of time that separate close friends from one another.

Threshing machines appear in Twenty One Pilots&#x27; music video for the song &quot;House of Gold&quot;.

The song The Thrashing Machine By Chad Morgan Depicts Chadwick trying to impress a girl by showing her his threshing machine.

<text>Moss is a coastal town and a municipality in Østfold county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Moss. The city of Moss was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt) and City in 1720. The rural municipality of Jeløy was merged with the city on 1 July 1943. The former municipality of Rygge was merged into it on 1 January 2020.

Its administrative district covers areas east of the town, such as the island of Dillingøy in the lake Vansjø. Parts of the town are located on the peninsula of Jeløy. The city of Moss has 30,723 inhabitants (2012).

==Name==
The Old Norse form of the name was . It may be derived from an old root &quot;mer-&quot; which means to &quot;divide&quot; or &quot;split&quot;.

The adjacent topography shares similar etymology:
* , Mosse-&quot;marsh-river-border&quot;+ (see , , Old Norse for river). The name is thought to be very old and the meaning of it is not clear.
* , Mosse-&quot;marsh-river-border&quot;+ (Moss channel).
* , Mosse-&quot;marsh-river-border&quot;+ -&quot;court&quot; akin to &quot;hort&quot;(&quot;us,en&quot;), &quot;garden,&quot; from PIE *ghr-ti-, from base *gher- &quot;to grasp, enclose&quot; (see yard) Actually &quot;Moss county&quot;.

==History==
Archeological finds suggest that there were settlements in the area more than 7,000 years ago and continuously through the Iron Age, Viking Age, through to modern times. During the Viking era, the place was known as &quot;Varna&quot; (from the Old Norse , or protection) and was the site of a cooperative for battleships held by local warlords on behalf of the king.

The first literary reference to the name &quot;Mo(u)ſs(ß)&quot; is from Bishop Eystein Aslaksson&#x27;s Red book (NRA AM fol. 328) from 1396, and by then the town had become a commercial center with craftsmen and mills. By the 16th century, the town&#x27;s port was significant enough to warrant its own customs official. Liquor distilleries became one of the dominant industries, and it was not until 1607, after the Reformation, that the town got its own church.

By 1700, Moss had become a hub for both ship and land traffic between Copenhagen and Christiania, and in 1704 Moss Jernverk (Moss Ironworks) was established just north of the city center. By 1720 it received its charter as a merchant town, with its own official. This may have had background in an important battle in 1716 that was fought in the town square in Moss in which Norwegian troops commanded by Vincent Budde prevailed over invading Swedish forces, sent by Charles XII to capture Akershus Fortress. In 1767 a local resident built a &quot;pleasure pavilion&quot; near the town, which survives as the Hotel Refsnes Gods.

In 1814, Moss became the site for the signing of the Convention of Moss, which effectively put an end to the Dano-Norwegian kingdom. This set the stage for economic development that has persisted to this day.

On the morning of 14 July 2006, a bolide exploded above the nearby town of Rygge - moments later, several stony meteorites fell over Moss. A number of meteorites were recovered by local residents and visiting meteorite hunters, which after analysis and classification, were found to be a rare type of carbonaceous chondrite.

===Seal and coat-of-arms===
Moss became a separate city in 1786 and received its first seal the same year. The seal showed a church under some clouds, placed within a circle. Above the circle were fasces, the late 19th century symbol of freedom. A later seal, dating from around 1829, shows the same composition, but with six birds flying around the church.

In the 1930s the city wanted to adopt a coat-of-arms and the birds were chosen as a possible symbol. The original birds were likely doves, a symbol of peace. In 1934, the idea of the crow was launched. The residents of Moss have long been referred to as crows. An old tale tells of a number of birds, thought to have been crows, swarming around the church spire due to a fire that started when lightning struck a birds&#x27; nest in the spire. The fire was quickly put out; birds became a motif in the city seal (and later coat-of-arms) for that reason.

The coat-of-arms was granted on 2 April 1954 and shows a yellow crow on a red background. It was designed by Christian Stenersen.

===Norwegian lady statues===
Moss and Virginia Beach, Virginia in the United States are sister cities. On Good Friday, 27 March 1891, the Norwegian bark &quot;Dictator&quot;, whose home port was Moss, was lost in the treacherous waters of the Graveyard of the Atlantic. The ship had been en route to England from Pensacola, Florida with a cargo of Georgia Pine lumber. After being caught and disabled in a storm, she was headed for port at Hampton Roads, Virginia to make repairs when she encountered another storm just off Virginia Beach.

Working in the high winds and seas, lifesaving crews from shore were able to save some of the 17 persons aboard. However, Captain J. M. Jorgensen&#x27;s pregnant wife, Johanne, and their 4-year-old son Carl were among the 7 persons who drowned.

The ship&#x27;s wooden female figurehead had washed ashore. It was placed in a vertical position facing the ocean near the boardwalk as a memorial to those who died in the shipwreck. It was a landmark there for more than 60 years, but gradually became weathered and eroded.

In 1962, Norwegian sculptor Ørnulf Bast was commissioned to create two nine-foot bronze replicas of the original figurehead by the City of Moss. The Norwegian Lady Statues were unveiled on 22 September 1962. One was presented as a gift to Virginia Beach, and an exact duplicate was erected in Moss to unite the two sister cities. Each statue gives the appearance of facing the other across the Atlantic Ocean.

On 13 October 1995, Queen Sonja of Norway visited the Norwegian Lady statue in Virginia Beach, and placed memorial flowers.

<text>Marl is an earthy material rich in carbonate minerals, clays, and silt. When hardened into rock, this becomes marlstone. It is formed in marine or freshwater environments, often through the activities of algae.

Marl makes up the lower part of the cliffs of Dover, and the Channel Tunnel follows these marl layers between France and the United Kingdom. Marl is also a common sediment in post-glacial lakes, such as the marl ponds of the northeastern United States.

Marl has been used as a soil conditioner and neutralizing agent for acid soil and in the manufacture of cement.

==Description==

Marl or marlstone is a carbonate-rich mud or mudstone which contains variable amounts of clays and silt. The term was originally loosely applied to a variety of materials, most of which occur as loose, earthy deposits consisting chiefly of an intimate mixture of clay and calcium carbonate, formed under freshwater conditions. These typically contain 35–65% clay and 65–35% carbonate. The term is today often used to describe indurated marine deposits and lacustrine (lake) sediments which more accurately should be named &#x27;marlstone&#x27;.

Marlstone is an indurated (resists crumbling or powdering) rock of about the same composition as marl. This is more correctly described as an earthy or impure argillaceous limestone. It has a blocky subconchoidal fracture, and is less fissile than shale. The dominant carbonate mineral in most marls is calcite, but other carbonate minerals such as aragonite or dolomite may be present.

&quot;Glauconitic marl&quot; is marl containing pellets of glauconite, a clay mineral that gives the marl a green color. Glauconite is characteristic of sediments deposited in marine conditions.

==Occurrences==
The lower stratigraphic units of the chalk cliffs of Dover consist of a sequence of glauconitic marls followed by rhythmically banded limestone and marl layers. Such alternating cycles of chalk and marl are common in Cretaceous beds of northwestern Europe. The Channel Tunnel follows these marl layers between France and the United Kingdom. Upper Cretaceous cyclic sequences in Germany and marl–opal-rich Tortonian-Messinian strata in the Sorbas Basin related to multiple sea drawdown have been correlated with Milankovitch orbital forcing.

Marl as lacustrine sediment is common in post-glacial lake-bed sediments. &quot;Chara&quot;, a macroalga also known as stonewort, thrives in shallow lakes with high pH and alkalinity, where its stems and fruiting bodies become calcified. After the alga dies, the calcified stems and fruiting bodies break down into fine carbonate particles that mingle with silt and clay to produce marl. Marl ponds of the northeastern United States are often kettle ponds in areas of limestone bedrock that become poor in nutrients (oligotrophic) due to precipitation of essential phosphate. Normal pond life is unable to survive, and skeletons of freshwater molluscs such as &quot;Sphaerium&quot; and &quot;Planorbis&quot; accumulate as part of the bottom marl.

In Hungary, Buda Marl is found that was formed in the Upper Eocene era. It lies between layers of rock and soil and may be defined it as both &quot;weak rock and strong soil.&quot;

Marl is the dominant rock type in the Vaca Muerta Formation in Argentina.

==Economic geology==
Marl has been used as a soil conditioner and neutralizing agent for acid soil and in the manufacture of Portland cement. Because some marls have a very low permeability, they have been exploited for construction of the Channel Tunnel between England and France and are being investigated for the storage of nuclear waste.

===Historical use in agriculture===
Marl is one of the oldest soil amendments used in agriculture. In addition to increasing available calcium, marl is valuable for improving soil structure and decreasing soil acidity and thereby making other nutrients more available. It was used sporadically in Britain beginning in prehistoric times and its use was mentioned by Pliny the Elder in the 1st century. Its more widespread use from the 16th century on contributed to the early modern agricultural revolution. However, the lack of a high-energy economy hindered its large-scale use until the Industrial Revolution.

Marl was used extensively in Britain, particularly in Lancashire, during the 18th century. The marl was normally extracted close to its point of use, so that almost every field had a marl pit, but some marl was transported greater distances by railroad. However, marl was gradually replaced by lime and imported mineral fertilizers early in the 19th century. A similar historical pattern was seen in Scotland.

Marl was one of a few soil amendments available in limited quantities in the southern United States, where soils were generally poor in nutrients, prior to about 1840. By the late 19th century, marl was being mined on an industrial scale in New Jersey and was increasingly being used on a more scientific basis, with marl being classified by grade and the state geological survey publishing detailed chemical analyses.

===Modern agricultural and aquacultural uses===
Marl continues to be used for agriculture into the 21st century, though less frequently. The rate of application must be adjusted for the reduced content of calcium carbonate versus straight lime, expressed as the calcium carbonate equivalent. Because the carbonate in marl is predominantly calcium carbonate, magnesium deficiency may be seen in crops treated with marl if they are not also supplemented with magnesium.

Marl has been used in Pamlico Sound to provide a suitable artificial substrate for oysters in a reef-like environment.

===Portland cement===
Marl has been used in the manufacture of Portland cement. It is abundant and yields better physical and mechanical properties than metakaolin as a supplementary cementitious material and can be calcined at a considerably lower temperature.

===Civil engineering===
The Channel Tunnel was constructed in the West Melbury Marly Chalk, a geological formation containing marl beds. This formation was chosen because of its very low permeability, absence of chert, and lack of fissures found in overlying formations. The underlying Glauconitic Marl is easily recognizable in core samples and helped establish the right level for excavating the tunnel.

Marl soil has poor engineering properties, particularly when alternately wetted and dried. The soils can be stabilized by adding pozzolan (volcanic ash) to the soil.

===Nuclear waste storage===
Some marl beds have a very low permeability and are under consideration for use in the storage of nuclear waste. One such proposed storage site is the Wellenberg in central Switzerland.

==Marl lakes==
A marl lake is a lake whose bottom sediments include large deposits of marl. They are most often found in areas of recent glaciation and are characterized by alkaline water, rich in dissolved calcium carbonate, from which carbonate minerals are deposited.

Marl lakes have frequently been dredged or mined for marl, often used for manufacturing Portland cement. However, they are regarded as ecologically important, and are vulnerable to damage by silting, nutrient pollution, drainage, and invasive species. In Britain, only the marl lakes of the more remote parts of northern Scotland are likely to remain pristine into the near future.

<doc id="46202" wikidata="Q974572" url="?curid=46202" title="Pink noise">
<text>Pink noise, noise, fractional noise or fractal noise is a signal or process with a frequency spectrum such that the power spectral density (power per frequency interval) is inversely proportional to the frequency of the signal. In pink noise, each octave interval (halving or doubling in frequency) carries an equal amount of noise energy.

Pink noise sounds like a waterfall. It is often used to tune loudspeaker systems in professional audio. Pink noise is one of the most commonly observed signals in biological systems.

The name arises from the pink appearance of visible light with this power spectrum. This is in contrast with white noise which has equal intensity per frequency interval.

==Definition==

Within the scientific literature, the term &quot;1/f noise&quot; is sometimes used loosely to refer to any noise with a power spectral density of the form

formula_1

where is frequency, and , with exponent usually close to 1. One-dimensional signals with are usually called pink noise.

The following function describes a length one-dimensional pink noise signal (i.e. a Gaussian white noise signal with zero mean and standard deviation , which has been suitably filtered), as a sum of sine waves with different frequencies, whose amplitudes fall off inversely with the square root of frequency (so that power, which is the square of amplitude, falls off inversely with frequency), and phases are random:

formula_2

 are independently and identically () chi-distributed variables, and are uniform random.

In a two-dimensional pink noise signal, the amplitude at any orientation falls off inversely with frequency. A pink noise square of length can be written as:
formula_3

General -like noises occur widely in nature and are a source of considerable interest in many fields. Noises with near 1 generally come from condensed-matter systems in quasi-equilibrium, as discussed below. Noises with a broad range of generally correspond to a wide range of non-equilibrium driven dynamical systems.

Pink noise sources include &quot;flicker noise&quot; in electronic devices. In their study of fractional Brownian motion, Mandelbrot and Van Ness proposed the name &quot;fractional noise&quot; (sometimes since called &quot;fractal noise&quot;) to describe noises for which the exponent is not an even integer, or that are fractional derivatives of Brownian () noise.

== Description ==

In pink noise, there is equal energy per octave of frequency. The energy of pink noise at each frequency level, however, falls off at roughly 3 dB per octave. This is in contrast to white noise which has equal energy at all frequency levels.

The human auditory system, which processes frequencies in a roughly logarithmic fashion approximated by the Bark scale, does not perceive different frequencies with equal sensitivity; signals around 1–4 kHz sound loudest for a given intensity. However, humans still differentiate between white noise and pink noise with ease.

Graphic equalizers also divide signals into bands logarithmically and report power by octaves; audio engineers put pink noise through a system to test whether it has a flat frequency response in the spectrum of interest. Systems that do not have a flat response can be equalized by creating an inverse filter using a graphic equalizer. Because pink noise tends to occur in natural physical systems, it is often useful in audio production. Pink noise can be processed, filtered, and/or effects can be added to produce desired sounds. Pink-noise generators are commercially available.

One parameter of noise, the peak versus average energy contents, or crest factor, is important for testing purposes, such as for audio power amplifier and loudspeaker capabilities because the signal power is a direct function of the crest factor. Various crest factors of pink noise can be used in simulations of various levels of dynamic range compression in music signals. On some digital pink-noise generators the crest factor can be specified.

== Generation ==

Pink noise can be computer-generated by first generating a white noise signal, Fourier-transforming it, then dividing the amplitudes of the different frequency components by the square root of the frequency (in one dimension), or by the frequency (in two dimensions) etc. This is equivalent to spatially filtering (convolving) the white noise signal with a white-to-pink-filter. For a length formula_4 signal in one dimension, the filter has the following form:

formula_5

Matlab programs are available to generate pink and other power-law coloured noise in one or any number of dimensions.

== Properties ==
=== Power-law spectra ===
The power spectrum of pink noise is formula_6 only for one-dimensional signals. For two-dimensional signals (e.g., images) the average power spectrum at any orientation falls as formula_7, and in formula_8 dimensions, it falls as formula_9. In every case, each octave carries an equal amount of noise power. 

The average amplitude formula_10 and power formula_11 of a pink noise signal at any orientation formula_12, and the total power across all orientations, fall off as some power of the frequency. The following table lists these power-law frequency-dependencies for pink noise signal in different dimensions, and also for general power-law colored noise with power formula_13 (e.g.: Brown noise has formula_14): 

=== Distribution of point values ===
Consider pink noise of any dimension that is produced by generating a Gaussian white noise signal with mean formula_15 and sd formula_16, then multiplying its spectrum with a filter (equivalent to spatially filtering it with a filter formula_17). Then the point values of the pink noise signal will also be normally distributed, with mean formula_15 and sd formula_19.

=== Autocorrelation ===
Unlike white noise, which has no correlations across the signal, a pink noise signal is correlated with itself, as follows.

==== 1D signal ====
The Pearson&#x27;s correlation coefficient of a one-dimensional pink noise signal (comprising discrete frequencies formula_20) with itself across a distance formula_8 in the configuration (space or time) domain is:
formula_22
If instead of discrete frequencies, the pink noise comprises a superposition of continuous frequencies from formula_23 to formula_24, the autocorrelation coefficient is:
formula_25
where formula_26 is the cosine integral function.

==== 2D signal ====
The Pearson&#x27;s autocorrelation coefficient of a two-dimensional pink noise signal comprising discrete frequencies is theoretically approximated as:
formula_27
where formula_28 is the Bessel function of the first kind.

== Occurrence ==
Pink noise has been discovered in the statistical fluctuations of an extraordinarily diverse number of physical and biological systems (Press, 1978; see articles in Handel &amp; Chung, 1993, and references therein). Examples of its occurrence include fluctuations in tide and river heights, quasar light emissions, heart beat, firings of single neurons, resistivity in solid-state electronics and single-molecule conductance signals resulting in flicker noise. Pink noise describes the statistical structure of many natural images. 

General 1/&quot;f&quot; α noises occur in many physical, biological and economic systems, and some researchers describe them as being ubiquitous. In physical systems, they are present in some meteorological data series, the electromagnetic radiation output of some astronomical bodies. In biological systems, they are present in, for example, heart beat rhythms, neural activity, and the statistics of DNA sequences, as a generalized pattern.

An accessible introduction to the significance of pink noise is one given by Martin Gardner (1978) in his &quot;Scientific American&quot; column &quot;Mathematical Games&quot;. In this column, Gardner asked for the sense in which music imitates nature. Sounds in nature are not musical in that they tend to be either too repetitive (bird song, insect noises) or too chaotic (ocean surf, wind in trees, and so forth). The answer to this question was given in a statistical sense by Voss and Clarke (1975, 1978), who showed that pitch and loudness fluctuations in speech and music are pink noises. So music is like tides not in terms of how tides sound, but in how tide heights vary.

=== Precision timekeeping ===

The ubiquitous 1/f noise poses a &quot;noise floor&quot; to precision timekeeping. The derivation is based on.

Suppose that we have a timekeeping device (it could be anything from quartz oscillators, atomic clocks, and hourglasses). Let its readout be a real number formula_29 that changes with the actual time formula_30. For concreteness, let us consider a quartz oscillator. In a quartz oscillator, formula_29 is the number of oscillations, and formula_32 is the rate of oscillation. The rate of oscillation has a constant component formula_33and a fluctuating component formula_34, so formula_35. By selecting the right units for formula_36, we can have formula_37, meaning that on average, one second of clock-time passes for every second of real-time.

The stability of the clock is measured by how many &quot;ticks&quot; it makes over a fixed interval. The more stable the number of ticks, the better the stability of the clock. So, define the average clock frequency over the interval formula_38 asformula_39Note that formula_40 is unitless: it is the numerical ratio between ticks of the physical clock and ticks of an ideal clock.

The Allan variance of the clock frequency is half the mean square of change in average clock frequency:formula_41where formula_42 is an integer large enough for the averaging to converge to a definite value.
For example, a 2013 atomic clock achieved formula_43, meaning that if the clock is used to repeatedly measure intervals of 7 hours, the standard deviation of the actually measured time would be around 40 femtoseconds.

Now we haveformula_44where formula_45 is one packet of a square wave with height formula_46 and wavelength formula_47. Let formula_48 be a packet of a square wave with height 1 and wavelength 2, then formula_49, and its Fourier transform satisfies formula_50.

The Allan variance is then formula_51, and the discrete averaging can be approximated by a continuous averaging: formula_52, which is the total power of the signal formula_53, or the integral of its power spectrum:

formula_54In words, the Allan variance is approximately the power of the fluctuation after bandpass filtering at formula_55 with bandwidth formula_56.
For formula_57 fluctuation, we have formula_58 for some constant formula_59, so formula_60. In particular, when the fluctuating component formula_34 is a 1/f noise, then formula_62 is independent of the averaging time formula_63, meaning that the clock frequency does not become more stable by simply averaging for longer. This contrasts with a white noise fluctuation, in which case formula_64, meaning that doubling the averaging time would improve the stability of frequency by formula_65.

The cause of the noise floor is often traced to particular electronic components (such as transistors, resistors, and capacitors) within the oscillator feedback.

=== Humans ===
In brains, pink noise has been widely observed across many temporal and physical scales from ion channel gating to EEG and MEG and LFP recordings in humans. In clinical EEG, deviations from this 1/f pink noise can be used to identify epilepsy, even in the absence of a seizure, or during the interictal state. Classic models of EEG generators suggested that dendritic inputs in gray matter were principally responsible for generating the 1/f power spectrum observed in EEG/MEG signals. However, recent computational models using cable theory have shown that action potential transduction along white matter tracts in the brain also generates a 1/f spectral density. Therefore, white matter signal transduction may also contribute to pink noise measured in scalp EEG recordings, 
particularly if the effects of ephaptic coupling are taken into consideration. 

It has also been successfully applied to the modeling of mental states in psychology, and used to explain stylistic variations in music from different cultures and historic periods. Richard F. Voss and J. Clarke claim that almost all musical melodies, when each successive note is plotted on a scale of pitches, will tend towards a pink noise spectrum. Similarly, a generally pink distribution pattern has been observed in film shot length by researcher James E. Cutting of Cornell University, in the study of 150 popular movies released from 1935 to 2005.

Pink noise has also been found to be endemic in human response. Gilden et al. (1995) found extremely pure examples of this noise in the time series formed upon iterated production of temporal and spatial intervals. Later, Gilden (1997) and Gilden (2001) found that time series formed from reaction time measurement and from iterated two-alternative forced choice also produced pink noises.

===Electronic devices===
The principal sources of pink noise in electronic devices are almost invariably the slow fluctuations of properties of the condensed-matter materials of the devices. In many cases the specific sources of the fluctuations are known. These include fluctuating configurations of defects in metals, fluctuating occupancies of traps in semiconductors, and fluctuating domain structures in magnetic materials. The explanation for the approximately pink spectral form turns out to be relatively trivial, usually coming from a distribution of kinetic activation energies of the fluctuating processes. Since the frequency range of the typical noise experiment (e.g., 1 Hz – 1 kHz) is low compared with typical microscopic &quot;attempt frequencies&quot; (e.g., 1014 Hz), the exponential factors in the Arrhenius equation for the rates are large. Relatively small spreads in the activation energies appearing in these exponents then result in large spreads of characteristic rates. In the simplest toy case, a flat distribution of activation energies gives exactly a pink spectrum, because formula_66

There is no known lower bound to background pink noise in electronics. Measurements made down to 10−6 Hz (taking several weeks) have not shown a ceasing of pink-noise behaviour. (Kleinpenning, de Kuijper, 1988) measured the resistance in a noisy carbon-sheet resistor, and found 1/f noise behavior over the range of formula_67, a range of 9.5 decades.

A pioneering researcher in this field was Aldert van der Ziel.

Flicker noise is commonly used for the reliability characterization of electronic devices. It is also used for gas detection in chemoresistive sensors by dedicated measurement setups.

===In gravitational wave astronomy===
1/&quot;f&quot; α noises with α near 1 are a factor in gravitational-wave astronomy. The noise curve at very low frequencies affects pulsar timing arrays, the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) and the future International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA); at low frequencies are space-borne detectors, the formerly proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and the currently proposed evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (eLISA), and at high frequencies are ground-based detectors, the initial Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and its advanced configuration (aLIGO). The characteristic strain of potential astrophysical sources are also shown. To be detectable the characteristic strain of a signal must be above the noise curve.

===Climate dynamics===
Pink noise on timescales of decades has been found in climate proxy data, which may indicate amplification and coupling of processes in the climate system.

=== Diffusion processes ===
Many time-dependent stochastic processes are known to exhibit 1/&quot;f&quot; α noises with α between 0 and 2. In particular Brownian motion has a power spectral density that equals 4&quot;D&quot;/&quot;f&quot; 2, where &quot;D&quot; is the diffusion coefficient. This type of spectrum is sometimes referred to as Brownian noise. The analysis of individual Brownian motion trajectories also show 1/&quot;f&quot; 2 spectrum, albeit with random amplitudes. Fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent &quot;H&quot; also show 1/&quot;f&quot; α power spectral density with α=2&quot;H&quot;+1 for subdiffusive processes (&quot;H&quot;&lt;0.5) and α=2 for superdiffusive processes (0.5&lt;&quot;H&quot;&lt;1).

== Origin ==

There are many theories about the origin of pink noise. Some theories attempt to be universal, while others apply to only a certain type of material, such as semiconductors. Universal theories of pink noise remain a matter of current research interest.

A hypothesis (referred to as the Tweedie hypothesis) has been proposed to explain the genesis of pink noise on the basis of a mathematical convergence theorem related to the central limit theorem of statistics. The Tweedie convergence theorem describes the convergence of certain statistical processes towards a family of statistical models known as the Tweedie distributions. These distributions are characterized by a variance to mean power law, that have been variously identified in the ecological literature as Taylor&#x27;s law and in the physics literature as &quot;fluctuation scaling&quot;. When this variance to mean power law is demonstrated by the method of expanding enumerative bins this implies the presence of pink noise, and vice versa. Both of these effects can be shown to be the consequence of mathematical convergence such as how certain kinds of data will converge towards the normal distribution under the central limit theorem. This hypothesis also provides for an alternative paradigm to explain power law manifestations that have been attributed to self-organized criticality.

There are various mathematical models to create pink noise. The superposition of exponentially decaying pulses is able to generate a signal with the formula_68-spectrum at moderate frequencies, transitioning to a constant at low frequencies and formula_69 at high frequencies. In contrast, the sandpile model of self-organized criticality, which exhibits quasi-cycles of gradual stress accumulation between fast rare stress-releases, reproduces the flicker noise that corresponds to the intra-cycle dynamics. The statistical signature of self-organization is justified in It can be generated on computer, for example, by filtering white noise, inverse Fourier transform, or by multirate variants on standard white noise generation.

In supersymmetric theory of stochastics, an approximation-free theory of stochastic differential equations, 1/&quot;f&quot; noise is one of the manifestations of the spontaneous breakdown of topological supersymmetry. This supersymmetry is an intrinsic property of all stochastic differential equations and its meaning is the preservation of the continuity of the phase space by continuous time dynamics. Spontaneous breakdown of this supersymmetry is the stochastic generalization of the concept of deterministic chaos, whereas the associated emergence of the long-term dynamical memory or order, i.e., 1/&quot;f&quot; and crackling noises, the Butterfly effect etc., is the consequence of the Goldstone theorem in the application to the spontaneously broken topological supersymmetry.

==Audio testing==
Pink noise is commonly used to test the loudspeakers in sound reinforcement systems, with the resulting sound measured with a test microphone in the listening space connected to a spectrum analyzer or a computer running a real-time fast Fourier transform (FFT) analyzer program such as Smaart. The sound system plays pink noise while the audio engineer makes adjustments on an audio equalizer to obtain the desired results. Pink noise is predictable and repeatable, but it is annoying for a concert audience to hear. Since the late 1990s, FFT-based analysis enabled the engineer to make adjustments using pre-recorded music as the test signal, or even the music coming from the performers in real time. Pink noise is still used by audio system contractors and by computerized sound systems which incorporate an automatic equalization feature.

In manufacturing, pink noise is often used as a burn-in signal for audio amplifiers and other components, to determine whether the component will maintain performance integrity during sustained use. The process of end-users burning in their headphones with pink noise to attain higher fidelity has been called an audiophile &quot;myth&quot;.

<doc id="46203" wikidata="Q226528" url="?curid=46203" title="35 mm movie film">
<text>35 mm film is a film gauge used in filmmaking, and the film standard. In motion pictures that record on film, 35 mm is the most commonly used gauge. The name of the gauge is not a direct measurement, and refers to the nominal width of the 35 mm format photographic film, which consists of strips wide. The standard image exposure length on 35 mm for movies (&quot;single-frame&quot; format) is four perforations per frame along both edges, which results in 16 frames per foot of film.

A variety of largely proprietary gauges were devised for the numerous camera and projection systems being developed independently in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, along with various film feeding systems. This resulted in cameras, projectors, and other equipment having to be calibrated to each gauge. The 35 mm width, originally specified as inches, was introduced around 1890 by William Kennedy Dickson and Thomas Edison, using 120 film stock supplied by George Eastman. Film 35 mm wide with four perforations per frame became accepted as the international standard gauge in 1909, and remained by far the dominant film gauge for image origination and projection until the advent of digital photography and cinematography.

The gauge has been versatile in application. It has been modified to include sound, redesigned to create a safer film base, formulated to capture color, has accommodated a bevy of widescreen formats, and has incorporated digital sound data into nearly all of its non-frame areas. Eastman Kodak, Fujifilm and Agfa-Gevaert are some companies that offered 35 mm films. As of 2015, Kodak is the last remaining manufacturer of motion picture film.

The ubiquity of 35 mm movie projectors in commercial movie theaters made 35 mm the only motion picture format that could be played in almost any cinema in the world, until digital projection largely superseded it.

==History and development==
===Early history===
In 1880, George Eastman began to manufacture gelatin dry photographic plates in Rochester, New York. Along with W. H. Walker, Eastman invented a holder for a roll of picture-carrying gelatin layer-coated paper. Hannibal Goodwin then invented a nitrocellulose film base in 1887, the first transparent, flexible film. Eastman also produced these components, and his was the first major company to mass-produce such film when, in 1889, Eastman realized that the dry-gelatino-bromide emulsion could be coated onto this clear base, eliminating the paper.

With the advent of flexible film, Thomas Edison quickly set out on his invention, the Kinetoscope, which was first shown at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. The Kinetoscope was a film loop system intended for one-person viewing. Edison, along with assistant William Kennedy Dickson, followed that up with the Kinetophone, which combined the Kinetoscope with Edison&#x27;s cylinder phonograph. Beginning in March 1892, Eastman and then, from April 1893 into 1896, New York&#x27;s Blair Camera Co. supplied Edison with film stock. Dickson is credited as the inventor of 35 mm movie film in 1889,652 when the Edison company was using Eastman film.653–654 The company still received film from Blair after this; at first Blair would supply only film stock that would be trimmed and perforated at the Edison lab to create gauge filmstrips, then at some point in 1894 or 1895, Blair began sending stock to Edison that was cut exactly to specification. Edison&#x27;s aperture defined a single frame of film at four perforations high.
Around 1896, a 35mm projector known as a &quot;photo-rotoscope&quot; was made by W. C. Hughes in London, which advanced the film by means of a &quot;dog&quot; motion.

For a time, it had been generally assumed that Dickson was following cinematography formats established by Eastman in producing the film, but Eastman had produced film in sheets that were then cut to order.652–653 Dickson used the film supplied for Eastman Kodak cameras in 1889, a transparent 70 mm celluloid film, in his development of a more suitable film stock, and &quot;simply slit this film in half&quot;;653–654 it was initially developed for the Kinetoscope, a one-person viewer, not to be projected.658 The image was still of high quality, even when magnified, and was more economical than 70 mm film (and more economical than any other gauge, as cutting the 70 mm to size would have created waste).654 35 mm was immediately accepted as standard by the Lumière brothers, and became the main film used in the UK because it was the stock sold to these filmmakers by the Blair company.653

Edison claimed exclusive patent rights to the design of 35 mm motion picture film, with four sprocket holes (perforations) per frame, forcing his only major filmmaking competitor, American Mutoscope &amp; Biograph, to use a 68 mm film that used friction feed, not sprocket holes, to move the film through the camera. A court judgment in March 1902 invalidated Edison&#x27;s claim, allowing any producer or distributor to use the Edison 35 mm film design without license. Filmmakers were already doing so in Britain and Europe, where Edison did not file patents. At the time, film stock was usually supplied unperforated and punched by the filmmaker to their standards with perforation equipment. A variation developed by the Lumière brothers used a single circular perforation on each side of the frame towards the middle of the horizontal axis.

==== Becoming the standard ====

When films began to be projected, several projection devices were unsuccessful and fell into obscurity because of technical failure, lack of business acumen on the part of their promoters, or both. The Vitascope, the first projection device to use 35 mm, was technologically superior and compatible with the many motion pictures produced on 35 mm film. Edison bought the device in 1895–96; the Lumiere&#x27;s 35 mm projection Cinematograph also premiered in 1895, and they established 35 mm as the standard for exhibition.658

Standardization in recording came from monopolization of the business by Eastman and Edison, and because of Edison&#x27;s typical business model involving the patent system: Eastman and Edison managed their film patents well656 – Edison filed the 35 mm patent in 1896, the year after Dickson left his employ657 – and so controlled the use and development of film.656 Dickson left the Edison company in 1895, going on to help competitors produce cameras and other film gauges that would not infringe on Edison&#x27;s patents. However, by 1900, filmmakers found it too expensive to develop and use other gauges, and went back to using the cheap and widely-available 35 mm.657

Dickson said in 1933:
Until 1953, the 35 mm film was seen as &quot;basic technology&quot; in the film industry, rather than optional, despite other gauges being available.652
In 1908, Edison formed &quot;a cartel of production companies&quot;, a trust called the Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC), pooling patents for collective use in the industry and positioning Edison&#x27;s own technology as the standard to be licensed out.656 35 mm became the &quot;official&quot; standard of the newly formed MPPC, which agreed in 1909 to what would become the standard: 35 mm gauge, with Edison perforations and a 1.3:1 (4:3) aspect ratio (also developed by Dickson).652 Scholar Paul C. Spehr describes the importance of these developments:

When the MPPC adopted the 35 mm format, Bell &amp; Howell produced cameras, projectors, and perforators for the medium of an &quot;exceptionally high quality&quot;, further cementing it as the standard.659 Edison and Eastman&#x27;s form of business manipulation was ruled unlawful in 1914, but by this time the technology had become the established standard.657 In 1917, the new Society of Motion Picture Engineers (SMPE) &quot;acknowledged the de facto status of 35mm as the industry&#x27;s dominant film gauge, adopting it as an engineering standard&quot;.659

===Innovations in sound===

When film editing was done by physically cutting the film, editing the picture could only have been done on the frame line. However, the sound was stored for the whole frame between each of the four sprocket holes, and so the sound editors could cut on any arbitrary set of holes, and thus get -frame edit resolution. With this technique, an audio edit could be accurate to within 10.41 ms.&quot;1–2 A limitation of analog optical recording was the audio frequency would cut off, in a well-maintained theater, at around 12kHz.4 Studios would often record audio on the transparent film strips, but with magnetic tape on one edge; recording audio on full 35 mm magnetic tape was more expensive.5

Three different digital soundtrack systems for 35 mm cinema release prints were introduced during the 1990s. They are: Dolby Digital, which is stored between the perforations on the sound side; SDDS, stored in two redundant strips along the outside edges (beyond the perforations); and DTS, in which sound data is stored on separate compact discs synchronized by a timecode track on the film just to the right of the analog soundtrack and left of the frame. Because these soundtrack systems appear on different parts of the film, one movie can contain all of them, allowing broad distribution without regard for the sound system installed at individual theatres.

The analogue optical track technology has also changed: in the early years of the 21st century, distributors changed to using cyan dye optical soundtracks instead of applicated tracks, which use environmentally unfriendly chemicals to retain a silver (black-and-white) soundtrack. Because traditional incandescent exciter lamps produce copious amounts of infrared light, and cyan tracks do not absorb infrared light, this change has required theaters to replace the incandescent exciter lamp with a complementary colored red LED or laser. These LED or laser exciters are backwards-compatible with older tracks. The film &quot;Anything Else&quot; (2003) was the first to be released with only cyan tracks.

To facilitate this changeover, intermediate prints known as &quot;high magenta&quot; prints were distributed. These prints used a silver plus dye soundtrack that were printed into the magenta dye layer. The advantage gained was an optical soundtrack, with low levels of sibilant (cross-modulation) distortion, on both types of sound heads.

===Modern 3D systems===

The success of digitally projected 3D movies in the first two decades of the 21st century led to a demand from some theater owners to be able to show these movies in 3D without incurring the high capital cost of installing digital projection equipment. To satisfy that demand, a number of systems had been proposed for 3D systems based on 35 mm film by Technicolor, Panavision and others. These systems are improved versions of the &quot;over-under&quot; stereo 3D prints first introduced in the 1960s.

To be attractive to exhibitors, these schemes offered 3D films that can be projected by a standard 35 mm cinema projector with minimal modification, and so they are based on the use of &quot;over-under&quot; film prints. In these prints a left-right pair of 2.39:1 non-anamorphic images are substituted for the one 2.39:1 anamorphic image of a 2D &quot;scope&quot; print. The frame dimensions are based on those of the Techniscope 2-perf camera format used in the 1960s and 1970s. However, when used for 3D the left and right frames are pulled down together, thus the standard 4-perf pulldown is retained, minimising the need for modifications to the projector or to long-play systems. The linear speed of film through the projector and sound playback both remain exactly the same as in normal 2D operation.

The Technicolor system uses the polarisation of light to separate the left and right eye images and for this they rent to exhibitors a combination splitter-polarizer-lens assembly which can be fitted to a lens turret in the same manner as an anamorphic lens. In contrast, the Panavision system uses a spectral comb filter system, but their combination splitter-filter-lens is physically similar to the Technicolor assembly and can be used in the same way. No other modifications are required to the projector for either system, though for the Technicolor system a silver screen is necessary, as it would be with polarised-light digital 3D. Thus a programme can readily include both 2D and 3D segments with only the lens needing to be changed between them.

In June 2012, Panavision 3D systems for both 35 mm film and digital projection were withdrawn from the market by DVPO theatrical (who marketed these system on behalf of Panavision) citing &quot;challenging global economic and 3D market conditions&quot;.

===Decline===
In the transition period centered around 2010–2015, the rapid conversion of the cinema exhibition industry to digital projection saw 35 mm film projectors removed from most of the projection rooms as they were replaced by digital projectors. By the mid-2010s, most of the theaters across the world had been converted to digital projection, while others continued running 35 mm projectors. In spite of the uptake in digital projectors installed in global cinemas, 35 mm film remains in a niche market of enthusiasts and format lovers.

==Attributes==
===Color===

Originally, film was a strip of cellulose nitrate coated with black-and-white photographic emulsion. Early film pioneers, like D. W. Griffith, color tinted or toned portions of their movies for dramatic impact, and by 1920, 80 to 90 percent of all films were tinted. The first successful natural color process was Britain&#x27;s Kinemacolor (1909–1915), a two-color additive process that used a rotating disk with red and green filters in front of the camera lens and the projector lens. But any process that photographed and projected the colors sequentially was subject to color &quot;fringing&quot; around moving objects, and a general color flickering.

In 1916, William Van Doren Kelley began developing Prizma, the first commercially viable American color process using 35 mm film. Initially, like Kinemacolor, it photographed the color elements one after the other and projected the results by additive synthesis. Ultimately, Prizma was refined to bipack photography, with two strips of film, one treated to be sensitive to red and the other not, running through the camera face to face. Each negative was printed on one surface of the same duplitized print stock and each resulting series of black-and-white images was chemically toned to transform the silver into a monochrome color, either orange-red or blue-green, resulting in a two-sided, two-colored print that could be shown with any ordinary projector. This system of two-color bipack photography and two-sided prints was the basis for many later color processes, such as Multicolor, Brewster Color and Cinecolor.

Although it had been available previously, color in Hollywood feature films first became truly practical from the studios&#x27; commercial perspective with the advent of Technicolor, whose main advantage was quality prints in less time than its competitors. In its earliest incarnations, Technicolor was another two-color system that could reproduce a range of reds, muted bluish greens, pinks, browns, tans and grays, but not real blues or yellows. &quot;The Toll of the Sea&quot;, released in 1922, was the first film printed in their subtractive color system. Technicolor&#x27;s camera photographed each pair of color-filtered frames simultaneously on one strip of black-and-white film by means of a beam splitter prism behind the camera lens. Two prints on half-thickness stock were made from the negative, one from only the red-filtered frames, the other from the green-filtered frames. After development, the silver images on the prints were chemically toned to convert them into images of the approximately complementary colors. The two strips were then cemented together back to back, forming a single strip similar to duplitized film.

In 1928, Technicolor started making their prints by the imbibition process, which was mechanical rather than photographic and allowed the color components to be combined on the same side of the film. Using two matrix films bearing hardened gelatin relief images, thicker where the image was darker, aniline color dyes were transferred into the gelatin coating on a third, blank strip of film.

Technicolor re-emerged as a three-color process for cartoons in 1932 and live action in 1934. Using a different arrangement of a beam-splitter cube and color filters behind the lens, the camera simultaneously exposed three individual strips of black-and-white film, each one recording one-third of the spectrum, which allowed virtually the entire spectrum of colors to be reproduced. A printing matrix with a hardened gelatin relief image was made from each negative, and the three matrices transferred color dyes into a blank film to create the print.

Two-color processes, however, were far from extinct. In 1934, William T. Crispinel and Alan M. Gundelfinger revived the Multicolor process under the company name Cinecolor. Cinecolor saw considerable use in animation and low-budget pictures, mainly because it cost much less than three-color Technicolor. If color design was carefully managed, the lack of colors such as true green could pass unnoticed. Although Cinecolor used the same duplitized stock as Prizma and Multicolor, it had the advantage that its printing and processing methods yielded larger quantities of finished film in less time.

In 1950, Kodak announced the first Eastman color 35 mm negative film (along with a complementary positive film) that could record all three primary colors on the same strip of film. An improved version in 1952 was quickly adopted by Hollywood, making the use of three-strip Technicolor cameras and bipack cameras (used in two-color systems such as Cinecolor) obsolete in color cinematography. This &quot;monopack&quot; structure is made up of three separate emulsion layers, one sensitive to red light, one to green and one to blue.

===Safety film===

Although Eastman Kodak had first introduced acetate-based film, it was far too brittle and prone to shrinkage, so the dangerously flammable nitrate-based cellulose films were generally used for motion picture camera and print films. In 1949 Kodak began replacing all nitrocellulose (nitrate-based) films with the safer, more robust cellulose triacetate-based &quot;Safety&quot; films. In 1950 the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded Kodak with a Scientific and Technical Academy Award (Oscar) for the safer triacetate stock. By 1952, all camera and projector films were triacetate-based. Most if not all film prints today are made from synthetic polyester safety base (which started replacing Triacetate film for prints in the early 1990s). The downside of polyester film is that it is extremely strong, and, in case of a fault, will stretch and not break–potentially causing damage to the projector and ruining a fairly large stretch of film: 2–3 ft or approximately 2 seconds. Also, polyester film will melt if exposed to the projector lamp for too long. Original camera negative is still made on a triacetate base, and some intermediate films (certainly including internegatives or &quot;dupe&quot; negatives, but not necessarily including interpositives or &quot;master&quot; positives) are also made on a triacetate base as such films must be spliced during the &quot;negative assembly&quot; process, and the extant negative assembly process is solvent-based. Polyester films are not compatible with solvent-based assembly processes.

===Other types===
Besides black &amp; white and color negative films, there are black &amp; white and color reversal films, which when developed create a positive (&quot;natural&quot;) image that is projectable. There are also films sensitive to non-visible wavelengths of light, such as infrared.

==Common formats==
===Academy format===
In the conventional motion picture format, frames are four perforations tall, with an aspect ratio of 1.375:1, . This is a derivation of the aspect ratio and frame size designated by Thomas Edison () at the dawn of motion pictures, which was an aspect ratio of 1.33:1. The first sound features were released in 1926–27, and while Warner Bros. was using synchronized phonograph discs (sound-on-disc), Fox placed the soundtrack in an optical record directly on the film (sound-on-film) on a strip between the sprocket holes and the image frame. &quot;Sound-on-film&quot; was soon adopted by the other Hollywood studios, resulting in an almost square image ratio of 0.860 in by 0.820 in.

By 1929, most movie studios had revamped this format using their own house aperture plate size to try to recreate the older screen ratio of 1.33:1. Furthermore, every theater chain had their own house aperture plate size in which the picture was projected. These sizes often did not match up even between theaters and studios owned by the same company, and therefore, uneven projection practices occurred.

In November 1929, the Society of Motion Picture Engineers set a standard aperture ratio of 0.800 in by 0.600 in. Known as the &quot;1930 standard&quot;, studios which followed the suggested practice of marking their camera viewfinders for this ratio were: Paramount-Famous-Lasky, Metro-Goldwyn Mayer, United Artists, Pathe, Universal, RKO, Tiffany-Stahl, Mack Sennett, Darmour, and Educational. The Fox Studio markings were the same width but allowed .04 in more height.

In 1932, in refining this ratio, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences expanded upon this 1930 standard. The camera aperture became , and the projected image would use an aperture plate size of , yielding an aspect ratio of 1.375:1. This became known as the &quot;Academy&quot; ratio. Since the 1950s the aspect ratio of some theatrically released motion picture films has been 1.85:1 (1.66:1 in Europe) or 2.35:1 (2.40:1 after 1970). The image area for &quot;TV transmission&quot; is slightly smaller than the full &quot;Academy&quot; ratio at , an aspect ratio of 1.33:1. Hence when the &quot;Academy&quot; ratio is referred to as having an aspect ratio of 1.33:1, it is done so mistakenly.

===Widescreen===
The commonly used anamorphic format uses a similar four-perf frame, but an anamorphic lens is used on the camera and projector to produce a wider image, today with an aspect ratio of about 2.39:1 (more commonly referred to as 2.40:1). The ratio was formerly 2.35:1—and is still often mistakenly referred to as such—until an SMPTE revision of projection standards in 1970. The image, as recorded on the negative and print, is horizontally compressed (squeezed) by a factor of 2.

The unexpected success of the Cinerama widescreen process in 1952 led to a boom in film format innovations to compete with the growing audiences of television and the dwindling audiences in movie theaters. These processes could give theatergoers an experience that television could not at that time—color, stereophonic sound and panoramic vision. Before the end of the year, 20th Century Fox had narrowly &quot;won&quot; a race to obtain an anamorphic optical system invented by Henri Chrétien, and soon began promoting the Cinemascope technology as early as the production phase.
Looking for a similar alternative, other major studios hit upon a simpler, less expensive solution by April 1953: the camera and projector used conventional spherical lenses (rather than much more expensive anamorphic lenses), but by using a removable aperture plate in the film projector gate, the top and bottom of the frame could be cropped to create a wider aspect ratio. Paramount Pictures began this trend with their aspect ratio of 1.66:1, first used in &quot;Shane&quot;, which was originally shot for Academy ratio. It was Universal Studios, however, with their May release of &quot;Thunder Bay&quot; that introduced the now standard 1.85:1 format to American audiences and brought attention to the industry the capability and low cost of equipping theaters for this transition.

Other studios followed suit with aspect ratios of 1.75:1 up to 2:1. For a time, these various ratios were used by different studios in different productions, but by 1956, the aspect ratio of 1.85:1 became the &quot;standard&quot; US format. These &quot;flat&quot; films are photographed with the full Academy frame, but are matted (most often with a mask in the theater projector, not in the camera) to obtain the &quot;wide&quot; aspect ratio. The standard, in some European countries, became 1.66:1 instead of 1.85:1, although some productions with pre-determined American distributors composed for the latter to appeal to US markets.

In September 1953, 20th Century Fox debuted CinemaScope with their production of &quot;The Robe&quot; to great success. CinemaScope became the first marketable usage of an anamorphic widescreen process and became the basis for a host of &quot;formats&quot;, usually suffixed with &quot;-scope,&quot; that were otherwise identical in specification, although sometimes inferior in optical quality. (Some developments, such as SuperScope and Techniscope, however, were truly entirely different formats.) By the early 1960s, however, Panavision would eventually solve many of the CinemaScope lenses&#x27; technical limitations with their own lenses, and by 1967, CinemaScope was replaced by Panavision and other third-party manufacturers.

The 1950s and 1960s saw many other novel processes using 35 mm, such as VistaVision, SuperScope, and Technirama, most of which ultimately became obsolete. VistaVision, however, would be revived decades later by Lucasfilm and other studios for special effects work, while a SuperScope variant became the predecessor to the modern Super 35 format that is popular today.

===Super 35===
The concept behind Super 35 originated with the Tushinsky Brothers&#x27; SuperScope format, particularly the SuperScope 235 specification from 1956. In 1982, Joe Dunton revived the format for &quot;Dance Craze&quot;, and Technicolor soon marketed it under the name &quot;Super Techniscope&quot; before the industry settled on the name Super 35. The central driving idea behind the process is to return to shooting in the original silent &quot;Edison&quot; 1.33:1 full 4-perf negative area (), and then crop the frame either from the bottom or the center (like 1.85:1) to create a 2.40:1 aspect ratio (matching that of anamorphic lenses) with an area of . Although this cropping may seem extreme, by expanding the negative area out perf-to-perf, Super 35 creates a 2.40:1 aspect ratio with an overall negative area of , only less than the 1.85:1 crop of the Academy frame (). The cropped frame is then converted at the intermediate stage to a 4-perf anamorphically squeezed print compatible with the anamorphic projection standard. This allows an &quot;anamorphic&quot; frame to be captured with non-anamorphic lenses, which are much more common. Up to 2000, once the film was photographed in Super 35, an optical printer was used to anamorphose (squeeze) the image. This optical step reduced the overall quality of the image and made Super 35 a controversial subject among cinematographers, many who preferred the higher image quality and frame negative area of anamorphic photography (especially with regard to granularity). With the advent of digital intermediates (DI) at the beginning of the 21st century, however, Super 35 photography has become even more popular, since everything could be done digitally, scanning the original 4-perf 1.33:1 (or 3-perf 1.78:1) picture and cropping it to the 2.39:1 frame already in-computer, without anamorphosing stages, and also without creating an additional optical generation with increased grain. This process of creating the aspect ratio in the computer allows the studios to perform all post-production and editing of the movie in its original aspect (1.33:1 or 1.78:1) and to then release the cropped version, while still having the original when necessary (for Pan &amp; Scan, HDTV transmission, etc.).

===3-perf===
The non-anamorphic widescreen ratios (most commonly 1.85:1) used in modern feature films makes inefficient use of the available image area on 35 mm film using the standard 4-perf pulldown; the height of a 1.85:1 frame occupying only 65% of the distance between the frames. It is clear, therefore, that a change to a 3-perf pulldown would allow for a 25% reduction in film consumption whilst still accommodating the full 1.85:1 frame. Ever since the introduction of these widescreen formats in the 1950s various film directors and cinematographers have argued in favour of the industry making such a change. The Canadian cinematographer Miklos Lente invented and patented a three-perforation pull down system which he called &quot;Trilent 35&quot; in 1975 though he was unable to persuade the industry to adopt it.

The idea was later taken up by the Swedish film-maker Rune Ericson who was a strong advocate for the 3-perf system. Ericson shot his 51st feature &quot;Pirates of the Lake&quot; in 1986 using two Panaflex cameras modified to 3-perf pulldown and suggested that the industry could change over completely over the course of ten-years. However, the movie industry did not make the change mainly because it would have required the modification of the thousands of existing 35 mm projectors in movie theaters all over the world. Whilst it would have been possible to shoot in 3-perf and then convert to standard 4-perf for release prints the extra complications this would cause and the additional optical printing stage required made this an unattractive option at the time for most film makers.

However, in television production, where compatibility with an installed base of 35 mm film projectors is unnecessary, the 3-perf format is sometimes used, giving—if used with Super 35—the 16:9 ratio used by HDTV and reducing film usage by 25 percent. Because of 3-perf&#x27;s incompatibility with standard 4-perf equipment, it can utilize the whole negative area between the perforations (Super 35) without worrying about compatibility with existing equipment; the Super 35 image area includes what would be the soundtrack area in a standard print. All 3-perf negatives require optical or digital conversion to standard 4-perf if a film print is desired, though 3-perf can easily be transferred to video with little to no difficulty by modern telecine or film scanners. With digital intermediate now a standard process for feature film post-production, 3-perf is becoming increasingly popular for feature film productions which would otherwise be averse to an optical conversion stage.

===VistaVision===
The VistaVision motion picture format was created in 1954 by Paramount Pictures to create a finer-grained negative and print for flat widescreen films. Similar to still photography, the format uses a camera running 35 mm film horizontally instead of vertically through the camera, with frames that are eight perforations long, resulting in a wider aspect ratio of 1.5:1 and greater detail, as more of the negative area is used per frame. This format is unprojectable in standard theaters and requires an optical step to reduce the image into the standard 4-perf vertical 35 mm frame.

While the format was dormant by the early 1960s, the camera system was revived for visual effects by John Dykstra at Industrial Light and Magic, starting with &quot;Star Wars&quot;, as a way of reducing granularity in the optical printer by having increased original camera negative area at the point of image origination. Its usage has again declined since the dominance of computer-based visual effects, although it still sees limited utilization.

==Perforations==

===BH perforations=== 
Film perforations were originally round holes cut into the side of the film, but as these perforations were subject to wear and deformation, the shape was changed to what is now called the Bell &amp; Howell (BH) perforation, which has straight top and bottom edges and outward curving sides. The BH perforation&#x27;s dimensions are from the middle of the side curve to opposite top corner by in height. The BH1866 perforation, or BH perforation with a pitch of , is the modern standard for negative and internegative films.

===KS perforations===
Because BH has sharp corners, the repeated use of the film through intermittent movement projectors creates strain that can easily tear the perforations. Furthermore, they tended to shrink as the print slowly decayed. Therefore, larger perforations with a rectangular base and rounded corners were introduced by Kodak in 1924 to improve steadiness, registration, durability, and longevity. Known as &quot;Kodak Standard&quot; (KS), they are high by wide. Their durability makes KS perfs the ideal choice for some (but not all) intermediate and all release prints, and original camera negatives which require special use, such as high-speed filming, but not for bluescreen, front projection, rear projection, or matte work as these specific applications demand the more accurate registration which is only possible with BH or DH perforations. The increased height also means that the image registration was considerably less accurate than BH perfs, which remains the standard for negatives. The KS1870 perforation, or KS perforation with a pitch of , is the modern standard for release prints.

These two perforations have remained by far the most commonly used ones. BH perforations are also known as &quot;N&quot; (negative) and KS as &quot;P&quot; (positive). The Bell &amp; Howell perf remains the standard for camera negative films because of its perforation dimensions in comparison to most printers, thus it can keep a steady image compared to other perforations.

===DH perforations===
The Dubray–Howell (DH) perforation was first proposed in 1932 to replace the two perfs with a single hybrid. The proposed standard was, like KS, rectangular with rounded corners and a width of , and, like BH, was tall. This gave it longer projection life but also improved registration. One of its primary applications was usage in Technicolor&#x27;s dye imbibition printing (dye transfer). The DH perf never had broad uptake, and Kodak&#x27;s introduction of monopack Eastmancolor film in the 1950s reduced the demand for dye transfer, although the DH perforation persists in special application intermediate films.

===CS perforations===
In 1953, the introduction of CinemaScope by Fox Studios required the creation of a different shape of perforation which was nearly square and smaller to provide space for four magnetic sound stripes for stereophonic and surround sound. These perforations are commonly referred to as CinemaScope (CS) or &quot;Fox hole&quot; perfs. Their dimensions are in width by in height. Due to the size difference, CS perfed film cannot be run through a projector with standard KS sprocket teeth, but KS prints &quot;can&quot; be run on sprockets with CS teeth. Shrunken film with KS prints that would normally be damaged in a projector with KS sprockets may sometimes be run far more gently through a projector with CS sprockets because of the smaller size of the teeth. Magnetic striped 35 mm film became obsolete in the 1980s after the advent of Dolby Stereo, as a result film with CS perfs is no longer manufactured.

During continuous contact printing, the raw stock and the negative are placed next to one another around the sprocket wheel of the printer. The negative, which is the closer of the two to the sprocket wheel (thus creating a slightly shorter path), must have a marginally shorter pitch between perforations (0.1866 in pitch); the raw stock has a long pitch (0.1870 in). While cellulose nitrate and cellulose diacetate stocks used to shrink during processing slightly enough to have this difference naturally occur, modern safety stocks do not shrink at the same rate, and therefore negative (and some intermediate) stocks are perforated at a pitch of 0.2% shorter than print stock.

<doc id="46204" wikidata="Q180729" url="?curid=46204" title="Prince of Wales">
<text>Prince of Wales (, ; ) is a title traditionally given to the male heir apparent to the English, and later British, throne. The title originated with the Welsh rulers of Gwynedd who, from the late 12th century, used it (albeit inconsistently) to assert their supremacy over the other Welsh rulers. However, to mark the finalisation of his conquest of Wales, in 1301, Edward I of England invested his son Edward of Caernarfon with the title, thereby beginning the tradition of giving the title to the heir apparent when he was the monarch&#x27;s son or grandson. The title was later claimed by the leader of a Welsh rebellion, Owain Glyndŵr, from 1400 until 1415.

King Charles III, created his son William Prince of Wales on 9 September 2022 the day after his accession to the throne, with formal letters patent issued on 13 February 2023. The title has become a point of controversy in Wales.

== Welsh princes of Wales ==

=== Origins to 1283 ===
The first known use of the title &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was in the 1160s by Owain Gwynedd, ruler of Kingdom of Gwynedd, in a letter to Louis VII of France. In the 12th century, Wales was a patchwork of Anglo-Norman Lordships and native Welsh principalities – notably Deheubarth, Powys and Gwynedd – competing among themselves for hegemony. Owain&#x27;s aim in using the title in his letter to Louis was probably to claim pre-eminence over the other native Welsh rulers. Following Owain&#x27;s death in 1170 no other ruler, with the exception of Rhys ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth, is known to have adopted the title until 1245. Rhys used several titles, sometimes concurrently, and in two charters from the 1180s he is referred to as &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; or &quot;Prince of the Welsh&quot;.

The title was revived in 1245 when Dafydd ap Llywelyn, ruler of Gwynedd, began using it in the final months of his reign. In the intervening years, Owen Gwynedd&#x27;s successors in Gwynedd, including Dafydd, had, instead, adopted the titles &quot;Prince of North Wales&quot; or &quot;Prince of Aberffraw and Lord of Snowdon&quot;.

However, it is in the reign of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Dafydd&#x27;s nephew and successor in Gwynedd, that the title is consistently used over an extended period. From 1262 to his death in 1282, Llywelyn used no other style except &#x27;Prince of Wales and Lord of Snowdon&#x27;. This was accompanied by Llywelyn making the Principality of Wales (encompassing Gwynedd, Deheubarth, Powys and parts of the Marches) a political reality. He had achieved this by significantly expanding his directly ruled territories into Mid- and South Wales and inducing all the other remaining native Welsh rulers to do him homage and acknowledge him as overlord by 1263. Additionally, Llywelyn developed governance structures which made his authority effective across the entire Principality of Wales, including in the territories of the Welsh rulers that owed him allegiance. The significance of these developments was marked by Henry III of England recognising Llywelyn&#x27;s title and authority in the Treaty of Montgomery of 1267. As J. Beverley Smith has noted, his title &quot;at once, acknowledged and proclaimed a status unique in Welsh political history&quot;.

Llywelyn&#x27;s principality was destroyed as a result of the conquest of Wales by Edward I between 1277 and 1283, during which Llewylyn was killed in 1282. After his death, his brother, Dafydd, adopted Llywelyn&#x27;s title and continued resistance for a few months. However, Dafydd was defeated and executed in 1283 and the principality was permanently annexed by Edward I.

=== Post-conquest claimants ===
In the fourteenth century, two pretenders to the title of &#x27;Prince of Wales&#x27; attempted to make good their claims: Owain Lawgoch, a descendant of the Princes of Gwynedd, and Owain Glyndŵr, whose ancestors included the former rulers of Powys and Deheubarth. Owain Lawgoch&#x27;s abortive attempt at invading Wales in 1372 was followed by Glyndŵr&#x27;s much more serious revolt beginning in 1400.

Glyndŵr&#x27;s rebellion commenced with his supporters proclaiming him Prince of Wales. However, it is unclear how important this was in his initial objectives, given that his immediate motivation appears to have been a personal grievance with a neighbouring English Lord. By 1401, he had effectively dropped his claim to the title. But, with the rebellion&#x27;s military successes of 14021403 and the growth in his support in Wales, he became more ambitious. In 1404, he had himself crowned as Prince of Wales, and he launched plans to create the state institutions of a new principality. This phase of the revolt was short-lived, however. By 1406, the rebellion began to fail militarily, and, from 1409, Glyndŵr had to exchange the trappings of a ruling prince for those of a hunted outlaw. He died in obscurity, probably around 1415.

== Heirs apparent to the English or British thrones ==
=== Titles and roles ===

The title is neither automatic nor heritable; it merges with the Crown when its holder eventually accedes to the throne, or reverts to the Crown if its holder predeceases the current monarch, leaving the sovereign free to grant it to the new heir apparent (such as the late prince&#x27;s son or brother).

The Prince of Wales usually has other titles and honours, if the eldest son of the monarch:

* Since 1301, the title &#x27;Earl of Chester&#x27; has generally been granted to each heir apparent to the English throne, and from the late 14th century it has been given only in conjunction with that of &#x27;Prince of Wales&#x27;. Both titles are bestowed to each individual by the sovereign and are not automatically acquired.
* Typically the prince is also Duke of Cornwall. Unlike the title Prince of Wales, this inherently includes lands and constitutional and operational responsibilities. The duchy of Cornwall was created in 1337 by Edward III for his son and heir, Edward of Woodstock (also known as &#x27;The Black Prince&#x27;). A charter was also created which ruled that the eldest son of the king would be the Duke of Cornwall.

No formal public role or responsibility has been legislated by Parliament or otherwise delegated to the prince of Wales by law or custom. In that role, Charles often assisted Elizabeth II in the performance of her duties. He represented her when welcoming dignitaries to London and during state visits. He also represented the Queen and the United Kingdom overseas at state and ceremonial occasions such as funerals. The Prince of Wales has also been granted the authority to issue royal warrants.

In 2011, along with the other Commonwealth realms, the United Kingdom committed to the Perth Agreement, which proposed changes to the laws governing succession, including altering the male-preference primogeniture to absolute primogeniture. The Succession to the Crown Act 2013 was introduced to the British parliament on 12 December 2012, published the next day, and received royal assent on 25 April 2013. It was brought into force on 26 March 2015, at the same time as the other realms implemented the Perth Agreement in their own laws.

=== Insignia ===

The Prince of Wales&#x27;s feathers are the badge of the Prince of Wales by virtue of being the heir apparent. The ostrich feathers are generally traced back to Edward of Woodstock (&#x27;The Black Prince&#x27;). He bore (as an alternative to his differenced royal arms) a shield of &quot;Sable, three ostrich feathers argent&quot;, described as his &quot;shield for peace&quot;, probably meaning the shield he used for jousting. These arms appear several times on his chest tomb in Canterbury Cathedral, alternating with his paternal royal arms (the royal arms of King Edward III differenced by &quot;a label of three points argent&quot;). The Black Prince also used heraldic badges of one or more ostrich feathers in various other contexts.

==Selected events and anomalies==
=== First English Prince of Wales ===
In order to finalise his conquest of Wales, Edward I began the custom of granting the title of Prince of Wales to the heir apparent to the English throne. Consequently, in 1301, Edward invested his Welsh-born eldest son, Edward of Caernarfon, as the first Plantagenet Prince of Wales.

Writing in &quot;Britannia&quot;, William Camden describes the killing of Llywelyn and Edward&#x27;s use of the title &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; for his son:
===Brothers===
In 1504, Henry Tudor (the future Henry VIII) was given the title after the death of his older brother Arthur (in 1502), who predeceased his father, King Henry VII.

The same occurred in 1616, when Henry Frederick Stuart predeceased (in 1612) his father James I; Henry&#x27;s brother Charles Stuart, later Charles I, was given the title.

===1911 investiture of Prince Edward===

Edward (then the heir apparent; later King Edward VIII) was invested as Prince of Wales at Caernarfon Castle in July 1911. This was the first such public investiture for centuries. He had been created Prince of Wales in June 1910.

On arrival, Edward addressed the crowd briefly, and somewhat poetically, in Welsh: &quot;Môr o gân yw Cymru i gyd.&quot; The king presented Edward with the insignia of his office. After the ceremony the royal party rejoined the royal yacht. It was said that the ceremonial was partly &quot;invented tradition&quot;.

=== 1969 investiture of Prince Charles ===

Although the investiture of Charles as Prince of Wales in 1969 took place during a period of social change and a growing Welsh nationalist movement, it was largely welcomed by people in Wales. The investiture was also attended, by invitation, by 3,500 people who lived and worked in Wales. In the UK, the press focused on the pomp and regalia, with newspaper headlines such as &quot;Welsh go wild for Their Royal Prince&quot; and &quot;Proud Wales takes Prince to her heart.&quot; It was also supported by the Secretary of State for Wales at the time, George Thomas, although he remained a controversial figure in Wales. Thomas later said to Prime Minister Harold Wilson that Charles&#x27;s speech had &quot;boosted Welsh nationalism.&quot;

The 1960s movement surrounding the investiture has historically been described as the &quot;anti-investiture movement&quot; and &quot;anti-investiture sentiment&quot;. The investiture occurred during a period of revival of the Welsh national consciousness, with an outspoken section considering him as an English Prince being imposed upon Wales. The investiture also led to significant protests in Wales. The group &quot;Cofia 1282&quot; (&quot;Remember 1282&quot;) also held protests against the investiture.

=== William as Prince of Wales ===

On 9 September 2022 (the day after his accession to the throne), during his first address as king, Charles III said of his son William, &quot;Today I am proud to create him Prince of Wales, Tywysog Cymru. The country whose title I&#x27;ve been so greatly privileged to bear during so much of my life of duty.&quot; Buckingham Palace stated that &quot;The Prince and Princess [of Wales] look forward to celebrating Wales&#x27;s proud history and traditions as well as a future that is full of promise&quot;. The First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, noted that &quot;William will be absolutely aware of the sensitivities that surround the title...&quot;

Though the title started to be used immediately afterward, it was only documented formally by letters patent on 13 February 2023.

== Contemporary debate ==

=== Title ===
Charles III proclaimed William as Prince of Wales on 9 September 2022, the day after the death of Elizabeth II, surprising Mark Drakeford, First Minister of Wales, who said he had not been given notice of the announcement. The creation of a new Prince of Wales was the catalyst for a renewed debate on the title, and already, on 8 September, a petition had been started calling for the title to be ended. The petition had garnered 25,000 signatures in its first few days.

Former Welsh Assembly presiding officer, Lord Elis-Thomas, had also questioned the need for the title to continue, and recalled previous discussion with the then Prince Charles, who expressed his desire never again to have an investiture in Caernarfon Castle. According to Elis-Thomas, Charles laughed and said, &quot;Do you think I want to put William through what I went through?&quot;.

The decision to grant William the title of Prince of Wales was criticised by the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru: Senedd member Cefin Campbell called the decision &quot;divisive&quot; and party leader Adam Price called for a public debate on the issue.

The question raised by critics was one of respect for Wales as a country in its own right, and the continued symbol of the historical invasion and oppression of Wales. William pledged that he would serve Wales with humility and great respect for its people, and spoke of the honour he felt to do so. He signalled a desire to reform the role.

The contemporary debate does not focus wholly on abolition, but explores how, if the title is to continue, it may be adapted to reflect the realities of the changing constitutional relationship with Wales. This includes the question of whether the Welsh Government should play a greater role in the appointment process, or whether there should be a Senedd ceremonial process to reflect the nation&#x27;s governance over its own affairs.

=== Opinion polls ===
A BBC Wales poll in 1999 showed that 73% of Welsh speakers believed the title should continue after Charles. A BBC poll in 2009, 40 years following the investiture, revealed 58% of Welsh people support the title &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;; 26% opposed the title. However, only 16% responded that Wales had benefited from having a prince.

In July 2018, an ITV poll found that 57% of Welsh people supported the title passing to William, with 22% for abolition or vacating the title. Support for another investiture was lower, with 31% supporting a ceremony similar to the 1969 one, 18% supporting a ceremony different to 1969, and 27% opposing an investiture.

In 2019, a BBC Wales poll showed that 50% supported the continuation of the title and 22% opposed. On the investiture, 41% supported a similar ceremony to 1969, 20% a different-style investiture ceremony, and 30% opposed any future investiture. A 2021 poll by Beaufort Research for Western Mail showed 61% of respondents in Wales supported another investiture, including 60% of Welsh-speakers polled.

In June 2022, an ITV/YouGov poll showed that 46% of adults in Wales wanted the Prince of Wales title to continue, and 31% said it should be abolished. In September 2022, a YouGov poll showed 66% support for Prince William to be given the title compared to 22% opposed, with 19% supporting a 1969-style investiture, 30% a different style of investiture and 34% opposing any investiture of Prince William as Prince of Wales.

== List of princes of Wales (English or British heirs apparent) ==

The current sovereign Charles III was the longest serving Prince of Wales for 64 years and 44 days between 1958 and 2022, and the oldest person to hold the position. He was also heir apparent for longer than any other in British history. Upon the death of his mother on 8 September 2022, Charles became king and the title merged with the Crown. The following day, King Charles III bestowed the title upon his elder son, Prince William, Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge. Prince William is the oldest person to be created Prince of Wales.

<doc id="46205" wikidata="Q633379" url="?curid=46205" title="Whitefish (fisheries term)">
<text>Whitefish or white fish is a fisheries term for several species of demersal fish with fins, particularly Atlantic cod (&quot;Gadus morhua&quot;), whiting (&quot;Merluccius bilinearis&quot;), haddock (&quot;Melanogrammus aeglefinus&quot;), hake (&quot;Urophycis&quot;), and pollock (&quot;Pollachius&quot;), among others. Whitefish (Coregonidae) is also the name of several species of Atlantic freshwater fish.

Whitefish live on or near the seafloor, and can be contrasted with the oily or pelagic fish, which live away from the seafloor. Whitefish do not have much oil in their tissue, and have flakier white or light-coloured flesh. Most of the oil found in their bodies is concentrated in the organs, e.g. cod liver oil.

Whitefish can be divided into benthopelagic fish (round fish that live &quot;near&quot; the sea bed, such as cod and coley) and benthic fish (which live &quot;on&quot; the sea bed, such as flatfish like plaice).

Whitefish is sometimes eaten straight but is often used reconstituted for fishsticks, gefilte fish, lutefisk, surimi (imitation crab meat), etc. Because of their lower oil and fat content, whitefish are particularly suitable for preservation by salting and drying. For centuries it was preserved by drying as stockfish and clipfish and traded as a world commodity. It is commonly used as the fish in the classic British dish of fish and chips.

==Growth==
The growth amidst whitefish species can be altered due to intraspecific competition. Fish populations such as Vendace and Roach share zooplankton for food which is crucial for young populations of whitefish. As this competition occurs, growth rate can be affected within multiple age groups or at an older age.

==Nutritional information==
One fillet of whitefish, mixed species (198g) contains the following nutritional information according to the United States Department of Agriculture:

<doc id="46206" wikidata="Q647070" url="?curid=46206" title="Clairvaux Abbey">
<text>Clairvaux Abbey (, ; ) was a Cistercian monastery in Ville-sous-la-Ferté, from Bar-sur-Aube. The abbey was founded in 1115 by Bernard of Clairvaux. As a primary abbey, it was one of the most significant monasteries in the order. Dissolved during the French Revolution, it was used from 1808 to 2023 as Clairvaux Prison, a high-security correctional facility. As of 2024, work is in process to make the space available and attractive to tourists.

Its layout was significantly altered by construction in the 18th and 19th centuries. Before it was a prison, Clairvaux Abbey served as an archetype for Cistercian monasteries; significant portions of the ancient abbey remain standing.

==History==

=== Founding to dissolution ===

According to legend, on 25 June 1115 the Cistercian monk Bernard was sent from Cîteaux Abbey with a group of twelve other monks to found a new monastery at Vallée d&#x27;Absinthe. Hughes I, Count of Troyes and a relative of Bernard, donated this valley to the Cistercians. Bernard was installed as first abbot by William of Champeaux, Bishop of Châlons-sur-Marne.

The abbey developed rapidly, eventually reaching its peak in numbers at 700 members belonging to Clairvaux alone, thus the largest Cistercian abbey in France. Many daughter monasteries followed. In 1118 Trois-Fontaines Abbey was founded from Clairvaux on land donated by Hugh de Vitry. Many nobles were buried there. Later, Clairvaux founded Foigny Abbey (1121), and Cherlieu Abbey was founded in 1131. During Bernard&#x27;s lifetime over sixty monasteries were founded from Clairvaux all over Europe and reaching into Scandinavia. Many (&quot;over a third of them&quot;) were pre-existing communities of monks, canons, or hermits who had decided to join the Cistercian movement.

Construction of the abbey in its roughly current form (named &quot;Clairvaux II&quot; by historians) began in 1135, and the abbey church was dedicated in 1174. However, the only building surviving from this time is a large 12th-century lay brother&#x27;s building, eventually converted into a barn. By the end of the 12th century, it had founded more than 250 daughter monasteries. As the mother of so many, Clairvaux occupied a central place in the Cistercian world.

Clairvaux continued to attract promising monks; one of them became a pope (Eugene III), twelve became cardinals, and over thirty were elevated to the episcopacy. The manuscripts copied and written at Clairvaux were of great importance. Research about the monks&#x27; literary and theological studies have led to a research project that seeks to reconstruct the abbey&#x27;s medieval library. In the 13th century, Clairvaux Abbot Stephen Lexington founded the Cistercian college at the University of Paris and it remained under the abbey&#x27;s responsibility for generations.

In the early modern period, Clairvaux was the origen of the movement toward stricter observance, particularly under Abbot Denis Largentier. Starting in 1708, comprehensive reconstruction of the abbey&#x27;s buildings in the classical style began, dubbed &quot;Clairvaux III&quot; by historians. The works were wide-ranging, and records indicate that construction was not complete upon the arrival of the revolution.

=== Revolution to present day ===

At the time of the French Revolution in 1789, Clairvaux had only 26 professed religious, counting the abbot, Louis-Marie Rocourt, ten lay brothers, and ten affiliated pensioners of the house; 19 of the religious and all the lay brothers were secularized.

Having become state property according to the decree of 2 November 1789, the abbey was purchased in 1792 and converted into a glassworks, which was repossessed by the state upon its bankruptcy in 1808 and turned into a prison. This fate was not uncommon for former monasteries following the penal reforms of Napoleon, it also befell others like Fontevraud and Mont-Saint-Michel. Because the abbey church was sold off as a quarry in 1812, a small new chapel was built inside the former refectory in 1828. During the 19th century, the abbey held 2,700 prisoners, including 500 women and 550 children. Deplorable conditions at the abbey inspired Victor Hugo to write his short story &quot;Claude Gueux&quot;, based on a real prisoner at Clairvaux, in 1834. Following a reform in 1875 that required individual cells for prisoners, &quot;chicken cages&quot;, cells measuring 1.5 x 2-meter (5 x 6.5 ft), were installed, they remained in use until 1971. The abbey was in 1926 as a historical monument by the French Ministry of Culture, but only one of the buildings, the one for the lay brothers, is medieval in origin yet erected after Bernard had died.

Starting in the 2000s, the prison was gradually dismantled. Comprehensive restorations began in 2013, and the prison was finally shut down in 2023. Renovation has been underway since.
