<text>Swami Vivekananda (12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta was an Indian Hindu monk, philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna. He was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world. He is credited with raising interfaith awareness and bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion in the late nineteenth century.

Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined from a young age towards religion and spirituality. At the age of 18 he met Ramakrishna, later becoming a devoted follower and &quot;sannyasin&quot; (renunciate). After the death of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda toured the Indian subcontinent as a wandering monk and acquired first-hand knowledge of the often terrible living conditions of Indian people in then British India. In 1893 he traveled to the United States where he participated in the Parliament of Religions in Chicago. Here he delivered a famous speech beginning with the words: &quot;Sisters and brothers of America ...&quot; introducing the ancient Hindu religious tradition to Americans and speaking forcefully about the essential unity of all spiritual paths, and the necessity of embracing tolerance and renouncing fanaticism. The speech made an extraordinary impression. One American newspaper described him as &quot;an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament&quot;.

After the great success of the Parliament, Vivekananda delivered hundreds of lectures across the United States, England, and Europe, disseminating the core tenets of Hindu philosophy. He founded the Vedanta Society of New York and the Vedanta Society of San Francisco (now Vedanta Society of Northern California), which became the foundations for Vedanta Societies in the West. In India, he founded the Ramakrishna Math, which provides spiritual training for monastics and householders, and the Ramakrishna Mission, which provides charity, social work and education.

Vivekananda is widely regarded as one of the greatest figures of modern India. He was one of the most influential philosophers and social reformers of his time, and the most successful missionary of Vedanta to the Western world. He was a major force in contemporary Hindu reform movements and in the development of nationalism in colonial India. He is considered to be a patriotic saint. His birthday is celebrated in India as National Youth Day.

==Early life (1863–1888)==

===Birth and childhood===

Vivekananda was born as Narendranath Datta (name shortened to Narendra or Naren) in a Bengali Kayastha family in his ancestral home at 3 Gourmohan Mukherjee Street in Calcutta, the capital of British India, on 12 January 1863 during the Makar Sankranti festival. He was one of nine siblings. His father, Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney at the Calcutta High Court. Durgacharan Datta, Narendra&#x27;s grandfather was a Sanskrit and Persian scholar who left his family and became a monk at age twenty-five. His mother, Bhubaneswari Devi, was a devout housewife. The progressive, rational attitude of Narendra&#x27;s father and the religious temperament of his mother helped shape his thinking and personality. Narendranath was interested in spirituality from a young age and used to meditate before the images of deities such as Shiva, Rama, Sita, and Mahavir Hanuman. He was fascinated by wandering ascetics and monks. Narendra was mischievous and restless as a child, and his parents often had difficulty controlling him. His mother said, &quot;I prayed to Shiva for a son and he has sent me one of his demons&quot;.

===Education ===
In 1871, at the age of eight, Narendranath enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar&#x27;s Metropolitan Institution, where he went to school until his family moved to Raipur in 1877. In 1879, after his family&#x27;s return to Calcutta, he was the only student to receive first-division marks in the Presidency College entrance examination. He was an avid reader in a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, religion, history, social science, art and literature. He was also interested in Hindu scriptures, including the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the Puranas. Narendra was trained in Indian classical music, and regularly participated in physical exercise, sports and organised activities. He studied Western logic, Western philosophy and European history at the General Assembly&#x27;s Institution (now known as the Scottish Church College). In 1881, he passed the Fine Arts examination, and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1884. Narendra studied the works of David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Baruch Spinoza, Georg W. F. Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer, Auguste Comte, John Stuart Mill and Charles Darwin. He became fascinated with the evolutionism of Herbert Spencer and corresponded with him. He translated Spencer&#x27;s book &quot;&quot; (1861) into Bengali. While studying Western philosophers, he also learned Sanskrit scriptures and Bengali literature.

William Hastie (the principal of Christian College, Calcutta, from where Narendra graduated) wrote of him: &quot;Narendra is really a genius. I have travelled far and wide but I have never come across a lad of his talents and possibilities, even in German universities, among philosophical students. He is bound to make his mark in life&quot;. He was known for his prodigious memory and speed reading ability, and a number of anecdotes attest to this. Some accounts have called Narendra a &quot;shrutidhara&quot; (a person with a prodigious memory).

===Initial spiritual forays===
In 1880, Narendra joined Keshab Chandra Sen&#x27;s &quot;Nava Vidhan&quot;, which was established by Sen after meeting Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and reconverting from Christianity to Hinduism. Narendra became a member of a Freemasonry lodge &quot;at some point before 1884&quot; and of the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in his twenties, a breakaway faction of the Brahmo Samaj led by Keshab Chandra Sen and Debendranath Tagore. From 1881 to 1884, he was also active in Sen&#x27;s Band of Hope, which tried to discourage youths from smoking and drinking.

It was in this cultic milieu that Narendra became acquainted with Western esotericism. His initial beliefs were shaped by Brahmo concepts, which denounced polytheism and caste restrictions, and proposed a &quot;streamlined, rationalized, monotheistic theology strongly coloured by a selective and modernistic reading of the &quot;Upanisads&quot; and of the Vedanta.&quot; Rammohan Roy, the founder of the Brahmo Samaj who was strongly influenced by unitarianism, strove towards a universalistic interpretation of Hinduism. His ideas were &quot;altered [...] considerably&quot; by Debendranath Tagore, who had a romantic approach to the development of these new doctrines, and questioned central Hindu beliefs like reincarnation and karma, and rejected the authority of the &quot;Vedas&quot;. Tagore, and later Sen, also brought this &quot;neo-Hinduism&quot; closer in line with western esotericism. Sen was influenced by transcendentalism, an American philosophical-religious movement strongly connected with unitarianism, which emphasised personal religious experience over mere reasoning and theology. Sen&#x27;s focus on creating &quot;an accessible, non-renunciatory, everyman type of spirituality&quot; that introduced &quot;lay systems of spiritual practice&quot; was an influence on the teachings Vivekananda later popularised in the west.

Not satisfied with his knowledge of philosophy, Narendra came to &quot;the question which marked the real beginning of his intellectual quest for God.&quot; He asked several prominent Calcutta residents if they had come &quot;face to face with God&quot;, but none of their answers satisfied him. At this time, Narendra met Debendranath Tagore (the leader of Brahmo Samaj) and asked if he had seen God. Instead of answering his question, Tagore said, &quot;My boy, you have the &quot;Yogi&quot;″s eyes.&quot; According to Banhatti, it was Ramakrishna who first truly answered Narendra&#x27;s question, by saying &quot;Yes, I see Him as I see you, only in an infinitely intenser sense.&quot; De Michelis, however, suggests that Vivekananda was more influenced by the Brahmo Samaj and its new ideas than by Ramakrishna. According to De Michelis, it was Sen&#x27;s influence that brought Vivekananda fully into contact with western esotericism, and it was via Sen that he met Ramakrishna. Swami Medhananda agrees that the Brahmo Samaj was a formative influence, but affirms that &quot;it was Narendra&#x27;s momentous encounter with Ramakrishna that changed the course of his life by turning him away from Brahmoism.&quot;

===Meeting Ramakrishna===

Narendra first met Ramakrishna in 1881. When Narendra&#x27;s father died in 1884, Ramakrishna became his primary spiritual focus.

Narendra&#x27;s introduction to Ramakrishna occurred in a literature class at General Assembly&#x27;s Institution, when Professor William Hastie was lecturing on William Wordsworth&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Excursion&quot;. While explaining the word &quot;trance&quot; in the poem, Hastie suggested that his students visit Ramakrishna of Dakshineswar to understand the true meaning of trance. This prompted Narendra, among others in the class, to visit Ramakrishna.

They probably first met personally in November 1881, though Narendra did not consider this their first meeting, and neither man mentioned this meeting later. At the time, Narendra was preparing for his upcoming F. A. examination. Ram Chandra Datta accompanied him to Surendra Nath Mitra&#x27;s house where Ramakrishna had been invited to deliver a lecture. According to Makarand Paranjape, at this meeting Ramakrishna asked Narendra to sing. Impressed by his talent, he asked Narendra to come to Dakshineshwar.

Narendra went to Dakshineswar in late 1881 or early 1882 and met Ramakrishna. This meeting proved to be a turning point in his life. Although he did not initially accept Ramakrishna as his teacher and rebelled against his ideas, he was attracted by his personality and frequently visited him. He initially saw Ramakrishna&#x27;s ecstasies and visions as &quot;mere figments of imagination&quot; and &quot;hallucinations&quot;. As a member of Brahmo Samaj, he opposed idol worship, polytheism, and Ramakrishna&#x27;s worship of Kali. He even rejected the Advaita Vedanta teaching of &quot;identity with the absolute&quot; as blasphemy and madness, and often ridiculed the idea. Ramakrishna was unperturbed and advised him: &quot;Try to see the truth from all angles&quot;.

Narendra&#x27;s father&#x27;s sudden death in 1884 left the family bankrupt; creditors began demanding the repayment of loans, and relatives threatened to evict the family from their ancestral home. Once the son of a well-to-do family, Narendra became one of the poorest students in his college. His attempts to find work were unsuccessful. He questioned God&#x27;s existence, but found solace in Ramakrishna, and his visits to Dakshineswar increased.

One day, Narendra asked Ramakrishna to pray to the goddess Kali for his family&#x27;s financial welfare. Ramakrishna instead suggested he go to the temple himself and pray. Narendra went to the temple three times, but did not pray for any kind of worldly necessities. He ultimately prayed for true knowledge and devotion from the goddess. He gradually became ready to renounce everything for the sake of realising God, and accepted Ramakrishna as his Guru.

In 1885, Ramakrishna developed throat cancer. He was transferred to Calcutta and then to a garden house in Cossipore. Narendra and Ramakrishna&#x27;s other disciples took care of him during his last days, and Narendra&#x27;s spiritual education continued. At Cossipore, he experienced &quot;Nirvikalpa samadhi&quot;. Narendra and several other disciples received ochre robes from Ramakrishna, forming his first monastic order. He was taught that service to men was the most effective worship of God. Ramakrishna asked him to take care of the other monastic disciples, and likewise asked them to see Narendra as their leader. Ramakrishna died in the early morning hours of 16 August 1886 in Cossipore.

===Founding of Ramakrishna Math===

After Ramakrishna&#x27;s death, support from devotees and admirers diminished. Unpaid rent accumulated, forcing Narendra and the other disciples to look for a new place to live. Many returned home, adopting a &quot;Grihastha&quot; (family-oriented) way of life. Narendra decided to convert a dilapidated house at Baranagar into a new &quot;math&quot; (monastery) for the remaining disciples. Rent for the Baranagar Math was low, and was raised by &quot;mādhukarī&quot; (holy begging). It became the first building of the Ramakrishna Math, the monastery of the monastic order of Ramakrishna. Narendra and other disciples used to spend many hours practicing meditation and religious austerities every day. Narendra recalled the early days of practice in the monastery:
In 1887, Narendra compiled a Bengali song anthology named &quot;Sangeet Kalpataru&quot; with Vaishnav Charan Basak. Narendra collected and arranged most of the songs in this compilation, but unfavourable circumstances prevented its completion.

===Monastic vows===
In December 1886, the mother of one of the monks, Baburam, invited Narendra and his brother monks to Antpur village. In Antpur, on the Christmas Eve of 1886, the 23 year old Narendra and eight other disciples took formal monastic vows at the Radha Gobinda Jiu temple. They decided to live their lives as their master lived.

==Travels in India (1888–1893)==

In 1888, Narendra left the monastery as a &quot;Parivrâjaka&quot; – a wandering monk, &quot;without fixed abode, without ties, independent and strangers wherever they go&quot;. His sole possessions were a kamandalu (water pot), staff and his two favourite books: the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; and &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot;. Narendra travelled extensively in India for five years, visiting centres of learning and acquainting himself with diverse religious traditions and social patterns. He developed sympathy for the suffering and poverty of the people, and resolved to uplift the nation. Living primarily on bhiksha (alms), he travelled on foot and by railway. During his travels he met and stayed with Indians from all religions and walks of life: scholars, &quot;dewans&quot;, rajas, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, &quot;paraiyars&quot; (low-caste workers) and government officials. On the suggestion of his patron, friend and disciple Raja Ajit Singh of Khetri, he adopted the name &quot;Vivekananda&quot;–a conglomerate of the Sanskrit words: &quot;viveka&quot; and &quot;ānanda&quot;, meaning &quot;the bliss of discerning wisdom&quot;. As Vivekananda he departed Bombay for Chicago, on 31 May 1893, intending to participate in the World&#x27;s Parliament of Religions.

==First visit to the West (1893–1897)==

Vivekananda visited several cities in Japan (including Nagasaki, Kobe, Yokohama, Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo), China and Canada en route to the United States, reaching Chicago on 30 July 1893. The &quot;Parliament of Religions&quot; took place in September 1893. An initiative of the Swedenborgian layman and Illinois Supreme Court judge Charles C. Bonney, the Congress sought to gather all the religions of the world, with the aim of showing &quot;the substantial unity of many religions in the good deeds of the religious life.&quot; The Brahmo Samaj and the Theosophical Society were invited as representative of Hinduism.

Vivekananda wished to participate, but learned that only individuals with credentials from a &quot;bona fide&quot; organisation would be accepted as delegates. Disappointed, he contacted Professor John Henry Wright of Harvard University, who had invited him to speak at Harvard. Vivekananda wrote of the professor: &quot;He urged upon me the necessity of going to the Parliament of Religions, which he thought would give an introduction to the nation&quot;. On hearing that Vivekananda lacked the credentials to speak at the Parliament, Wright said: &quot;To ask for your credentials is like asking the sun to state its right to shine in the heavens&quot;. Vivekananda submitted an application introducing himself as a monk &quot;of the oldest order of &quot;sannyāsis&quot; ... founded by Sankara&quot;. The application was supported by the Brahmo Samaj representative Protapchandra Mozoombar, who was also a member of the Parliament&#x27;s selection committee.

===Parliament of the World&#x27;s Religions===

The Parliament of the World&#x27;s Religions opened on 11 September 1893 at the Art Institute of Chicago, as part of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. On this day, Vivekananda gave a brief speech representing India and Hinduism. He bowed to Saraswati (the Hindu goddess of learning) and began his with &quot;Sisters and brothers of America!&quot;. At these words, Vivekananda received a two-minute standing ovation from the crowd of seven thousand. When silence was restored he began his address, greeting the youngest of the nations on behalf of &quot;the most ancient order of monks in the world, the Vedic order of sannyasins, a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance&quot;. Vivekananda quoted two illustrative passages from the &quot;Shiva mahimna stotram&quot;: &quot;As the different streams having their sources in different places all mingle their water in the sea, so, O Lord, the different paths which men take, through different tendencies, various though they appear, crooked or straight, all lead to Thee!&quot; and &quot;Whosoever comes to Me, through whatsoever form, I reach him; all men are struggling through paths that in the end lead to Me.&quot; According to Sailendra Nath Dhar, &quot;it was only a short speech, but it voiced the spirit of the Parliament.&quot;

Parliament President John Henry Barrows said, &quot;India, the Mother of religions was represented by Swami Vivekananda, the Orange-monk who exercised the most wonderful influence over his auditors&quot;. Vivekananda attracted widespread attention in the press, which called him the &quot;cyclonic monk from India&quot;. The &quot;New York Critique&quot; wrote, &quot;He is an orator by divine right, and his strong, intelligent face in its picturesque setting of yellow and orange was hardly less interesting than those earnest words, and the rich, rhythmical utterance he gave them&quot;. The &quot;New York Herald&quot; noted, &quot;Vivekananda is undoubtedly the greatest figure in the Parliament of Religions. After hearing him we feel how foolish it is to send missionaries to this learned nation&quot;. American newspapers reported Vivekananda as &quot;the greatest figure in the parliament of religions&quot; and &quot;the most popular and influential man in the parliament&quot;.
The &quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot; reported that Vivekananda was &quot;a great favourite at the parliament... if he merely crosses the platform, he is applauded&quot;. He spoke &quot;at receptions, the scientific section, and private homes&quot; on topics related to Hinduism, Buddhism and harmony among religions. Vivekananda&#x27;s speeches at the Parliament had the common theme of universality, emphasising religious tolerance. He soon became known as a &quot;handsome oriental&quot; and made a huge impression as an orator. Hearing Vivekananda speak, Harvard psychology professor William James said, &quot;that man is simply a wonder for oratorical power. He is an honor to humanity.&quot;

===Lecture tours in the UK and US===

After the Parliament of Religions, Vivekananda toured many parts of the US as a guest. His popularity gave him an unprecedented opportunity to communicate his views on life and religion to great numbers of people. During a question-answer session at Brooklyn Ethical Society, he remarked, &quot;I have a message to the West as Buddha had a message to the East.&quot; On another occasion he described his mission thus:I do not come to convert you to a new belief. I want you to keep your own belief; I want to make the Methodist a better Methodist; the Presbyterian a better Presbyterian; the Unitarian a better Unitarian. I want to teach you to live the truth, to reveal the light within your own soul.

Vivekananda spent nearly two years lecturing in the eastern and central United States, primarily in Chicago, Detroit, Boston, and New York. He founded the Vedanta Society of New York in 1894. His demanding schedule eventually began to affect his health, and in Spring 1895 he ended his lecture tours and began giving free, private classes in Vedanta and yoga. Beginning in June 1895, he gave private lectures to a dozen of his disciples at Thousand Island Park, New York for two months. Vivekananda was offered academic positions in two American universities (one the chair in Eastern Philosophy at Harvard University and a similar position at Columbia University); he declined both, since his duties would conflict with his commitment as a monk.

Vivekananda travelled to the United Kingdom in 1895 and again in 1896. In November 1895 he met an Irish woman, Margaret Elizabeth Noble, who would become one of his closest disciples, known as Sister Nivedita (a name given her by the Swami, meaning &quot;dedicated to God&quot;). On his second visit, in May 1896, Vivekananda met Max Müller, a noted Indologist from Oxford University who wrote Ramakrishna&#x27;s first biography in the West. From the UK, he visited other European countries. In Germany, he met Paul Deussen, another renowned Indologist.

Vivekananda&#x27;s success led to a change in mission, namely the establishment of Vedanta centres in the West. He adapted traditional Hindu ideas and religiosity to suit the needs and understandings of his western audiences, who were more familiar with western esoteric traditions and movements. An important element in his adaptation of Hindu religiosity was the introduction of his &quot;four yogas&quot; model, based in Raja yoga, which offered a practical means to realise the divine force within, a central goal of modern western esotericism. In 1896, his book &quot;Raja Yoga&quot;, an interpretation and adaptation of Patanjali&#x27;s Yoga sutras, was published, becoming an instant success; it became highly influential in the western understanding of yoga, in Elizabeth de Michelis&#x27;s view marking the beginning of modern yoga.

Vivekananda attracted followers and admirers in the US and Europe, including Josephine MacLeod, Betty Leggett, Lady Sandwich, William James, Josiah Royce, Robert G. Ingersoll, Lord Kelvin, Harriet Monroe, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, Sarah Bernhardt, Nikola Tesla, Emma Calvé and Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz. He initiated several followers, including Marie Louise (a French woman) who became Swami Abhayananda, and Leon Landsberg who became Swami Kripananda, so that they could serve the mission of the Vedanta Society. He also initiated Christina Greenstidel of Detroit, who became Sister Christine, with whom he developed a close father–daughter relationship.

While in America, Vivekananda was given land to establish a retreat for Vedanta students, in the mountains to the southeast of San Jose, California. He called it &quot;Peace retreat&quot;, or &quot;Shanti Asrama&quot;. There were twelve main centres established in America, the largest being the Vedanta Society of Southern California in Hollywood. There is also a Vedanta Press in Hollywood which publishes books about Vedanta and English translations of Hindu scriptures and texts.

From the West, Vivekananda revived his work in India. He regularly corresponded with his followers and brother monks, offering advice and financial support. His letters from this period reflect his campaign of social service, and were strongly worded. He wrote to Akhandananda, &quot;Go from door to door amongst the poor and lower classes of the town of Khetri and teach them religion. Also, let them have oral lessons on geography and such other subjects. No good will come of sitting idle and having princely dishes, and saying &quot;Ramakrishna, O Lord!&quot;—unless you can do some good to the poor&quot;. In 1895, Vivekananda founded the periodical &quot;Brahmavadin&quot;. His translation of the first six chapters of &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot; was published in &quot;Brahmavadin&quot; in 1899. Vivekananda left for India from England on 16 December 1896, accompanied by his disciples Captain and Mrs. Sevier and J.J. Goodwin. On the way, they visited France and Italy, and set sail for India from Naples on 30 December 1896. He was followed to India by Sister Nivedita, who devoted the rest of her life to the education of Indian women and the goal of India&#x27;s independence.

==Back in India (1897–1899)==
Vivekananda arrived in Colombo, British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) on 15 January 1897, and received a warm welcome. In Colombo, he gave his . He travelled from Colombo to Pamban, Rameswaram, Ramnad, Madurai, Kumbakonam and Madras, delivering lectures. Common people and rajas gave him an enthusiastic reception. During his train travels, people often sat on the rails to force the train to stop, so they could hear him. From Madras (now Chennai), he continued his journey to Calcutta and Almora. While in the West, Vivekananda spoke about India&#x27;s great spiritual heritage; in India, he repeatedly addressed social issues: uplifting the people, eliminating the caste system, promoting science and industrialisation, addressing widespread poverty, and ending colonial rule. The lectures, published as &quot;Lectures from Colombo to Almora&quot;, demonstrated his fervent nationalism and spiritual ideology.

On 1 May 1897 in Calcutta, Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Mission, an institution dedicated to social service, with ideals based on &quot;&quot;. Its governing body consists of the trustees of the Ramakrishna Math (which conducts religious work). Both Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission have their headquarters at Belur Math. Vivekananda founded two other monasteries: one in Mayavati in the Himalayas (near Almora), the &quot;Advaita Ashrama&quot; and another in Madras (now Chennai). Two journals were founded: &quot;Prabuddha Bharata&quot; in English and &quot;Udbhodan&quot; in Bengali. That year, famine-relief work was begun by Swami Akhandananda in the Murshidabad district.

Vivekananda earlier inspired Jamsetji Tata to set up a research and educational institution when they travelled together from Yokohama to Chicago on Vivekananda&#x27;s first visit to the West in 1893. Tata now asked him to head his Research Institute of Science; Vivekananda declined the offer, citing a conflict with his &quot;spiritual interests&quot;. He visited Punjab, attempting to mediate an ideological conflict between Arya Samaj (a reformist Hindu movement) and &quot;sanatan&quot; (orthodox Hindus). After brief visits to Lahore, Delhi and Khetri, Vivekananda returned to Calcutta in January 1898. He consolidated the work of the math and trained disciples for several months. Vivekananda composed &quot;Khandana Bhava–Bandhana&quot;, a prayer song dedicated to Ramakrishna, in 1898.

==Second visit to the West and final years (1899–1902)==
Despite declining health, Vivekananda left for the West for a second time in June 1899. On this occasion, he was accompanied by Sister Nivedita and Swami Turiyananda. After a brief stay in England, he went to the United States where he established Vedanta Societies in San Francisco and New York and founded a &quot;shanti ashrama&quot; (peace retreat) in California. He travelled to Paris for the Congress of Religions in 1900. His lectures at the Congress concerned the worship of the &quot;lingam&quot; and the authenticity of the Bhagavad Gita. Vivekananda then visited Brittany, Vienna, Istanbul, Athens and Egypt. The French philosopher Jules Bois was his host for most of this period. Vivekananda returned to Calcutta on 9 December 1900.

After a brief visit to the Advaita Ashrama in Mayavati, Vivekananda settled at Belur Math, where he continued co-ordinating the works of the Ramakrishna Mission, the math, and the initiatives in England and the US. He had many visitors, including royalty and politicians. Due to deteriorating health, Vivekananda was unable to attend the Congress of Religions in Japan in 1901, but he made pilgrimages to Bodhgaya and Varanasi. His health problems, including asthma, diabetes and chronic insomnia, restricted his activity.

==Death==
On 4 July 1902 (the day of his death), Vivekananda awoke early, went to the monastery at Belur Math and meditated for three hours. He taught &quot;Shukla-Yajur-Veda&quot;, Sanskrit grammar and the philosophy of yoga to pupils, later discussing with colleagues a planned Vedic college in the Ramakrishna Math. At 7:00 pm Vivekananda went to his room, asking not to be disturbed; he died at 9:20 p.m. while meditating. The rupture of a blood vessel in his brain was reported as a possible cause of death. According to his disciples, the rupture was due to his &quot;brahmarandhra&quot; (an opening in the crown of his head) being pierced when he attained &quot;mahasamādhi&quot;. Vivekananda fulfilled his prophecy that he would not live forty years. He was cremated on a sandalwood funeral pyre on the bank of the Ganga in Belur, opposite where Ramakrishna was cremated sixteen years earlier.

==Teachings and philosophy==

Vivekananda synthesised and popularised various strands of Hindu thought, most notably classical yoga and Advaita Vedanta. As a young man, he had been influenced by western ideas such as Universalism, via Unitarian missionaries who collaborated with the Brahmo Samaj. His initial beliefs were shaped by Brahmo concepts, which included belief in a formless God, the deprecation of idolatry, and, according to Michelis, a &quot;streamlined, rationalized, monotheistic theology strongly coloured by a selective and modernistic reading of the &quot;Upanisads&quot; and of the Vedanta&quot;.

Influenced by Ramakrishna, he came to see the Vedanta as providing the ontological basis for &quot;śivajñāne jīver sevā&quot; – the spiritual practice of serving human beings as actual manifestations of the divine. For Vivekananda, the practice of remembering the presence of the divine in all people, regardless of social status, promoted social harmony and helped develop the capacity for love.

===Vedanta and yoga===

Vivekananda thought that the essence of Hinduism was best expressed in Adi Shankara&#x27;s Advaita Vedanta philosophy. He adhered to Ramakrishna&#x27;s teaching that the Absolute is both immanent and transcendent. According to Anil Sooklal, Vivekananda&#x27;s neo-Vedanta &quot;reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism,&quot; viewing Brahman as &quot;one without a second&quot; yet both &quot;saguna&quot; (qualified) and &quot;nirguna&quot; (qualityless). According to Jackson, the Vedanta acquires a modern and Universalistic form in Vivekananda&#x27;s summary, showing also the influence of classical yoga:
Vivekananda&#x27;s emphasis on &quot;nirvikalpa samadhi&quot; was preceded by medieval yogic influences on Advaita Vedanta. In line with Advaita Vedanta texts like &quot;Dŗg-Dŗśya-Viveka&quot; (14th century) and &quot;Vedantasara (of Sadananda)&quot; (15th century), Vivekananda saw samadhi as a means to attain liberation.

An important element in his adaptation of Hindu religiosity was the introduction of his four yogas model, which includes Raja yoga, his interpretation of Patanjali&#x27;s &quot;Yoga sutras&quot;. This offered a practical means to realise the divine force within, a central idea in modern Western esotericism. His book &quot;Raja Yoga&quot; was highly influential in the Western understanding of yoga.

===Western esotericism===

Via his affiliations with Keshub Chandra Sen&#x27;s &quot;Nava Vidhan&quot;, the Freemasonry lodge, the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj, and Sen&#x27;s Band of Hope, Vivekananda became acquainted with Western esotericism. His knowledge of Western esotericism aided his success in Western esoteric circles, beginning with his speech in 1893 at the Parliament of Religions. He adapted traditional Hindu ideas and religiosity to suit the needs and understandings of his Western audiences, particularly those familiar with Western esoteric traditions and movements such as Transcendentalism and New thought.

Vivekananda&#x27;s notion of involution was probably influenced by western Theosophists, Darwin&#x27;s notion of evolution, and possibly also the Samkhya term &quot;sātkarya&quot;. According to Meera Nanda, &quot;Vivekananda uses the word involution exactly how it appears in Theosophy: the descent, or the involvement, of divine consciousness into matter.&quot; Theosophic ideas on involution have &quot;much in common&quot; with &quot;theories of the descent of God in Gnosticism, Kabbalah, and other esoteric schools&quot;. With spirit, Vivekananda refers to &quot;prana&quot; or &quot;purusha&quot;, derived from Samkhya and classical yoga as presented by Patanjali in the Yoga sutras.

===Moral and social philosophy===

Vivekananda linked morality with control of the mind, seeing truth, purity and unselfishness as traits which strengthened it. He advised his followers to be holy, unselfish and to have &quot;shraddhā&quot; (faith). Vivekananda supported &quot;brahmacharya&quot;, believing it the source of his physical and mental stamina and eloquence.

Nationalism was a prominent theme in Vivekananda&#x27;s thought. He believed that a country&#x27;s future depends on its people, and his teachings focused on human development. He wanted &quot;to set in motion a machinery which will bring noblest ideas to the doorstep of even the poorest and the meanest&quot;.

==Influence and legacy==

Swami Vivekananda was one of the most influential philosophers and social reformers in his contemporary India. He is considered to be the most successful and influential missionary of Vedanta to the Western world.

===Neo-Vedanta===
Vivekananda is considered to be a representative of Neo-Vedanta – a modern interpretation of certain aspects of Hinduism that are thought to be compatible with western esoteric traditions, such as Transcendentalism, New Thought and Theosophy. His reinterpretation created a new understanding and appreciation of Hinduism inside and outside India, and paved the way for the enthusiastic reception of other forms of Indian spiritual self-improvement in the West, such as yoga and Transcendental Meditation. According to Agehananda Bharati: &quot;...modern Hindus derive their knowledge of Hinduism from Vivekananda, directly or indirectly&quot;. Vivekananda espoused the idea that all sects within Hinduism (and all religions) are different paths to the same goal.

===Indian nationalism===
Vivekananda&#x27;s nationalism gave unprecedented substance to the emerging nationalist ideal of British-ruled India. According to social reformer Charles Freer Andrews, &quot;The Swami&#x27;s intrepid patriotism gave a new colour to the national movement throughout India. More than any other single individual of that period Vivekananda had made his contribution to the new awakening of India&quot;. Vivekananda drew attention to the extent of poverty in the country, and maintained that addressing such poverty was a prerequisite for national awakening. His nationalistic ideas influenced many Indian thinkers and leaders. Sri Aurobindo regarded Vivekananda as the one who awakened India spiritually. Mahatma Gandhi counted him among the few Hindu reformers &quot;who have maintained this Hindu religion in a state of splendor by cutting down the dead wood of tradition&quot;.

===Name-giving===
In September 2010, the then Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, who later became President of India, approved in principle the Swami Vivekananda Values Education Project at a cost of . The project&#x27;s objectives included publishing Vivekananda&#x27;s works in a number of languages, and involving youth with competitions, essays, discussions and study circles. In 2011, the West Bengal Police Training College was renamed the Swami Vivekananda State Police Academy, West Bengal. The state technical university in Chhattisgarh has been named the Chhattisgarh Swami Vivekanand Technical University. In 2012, the Raipur airport was renamed Swami Vivekananda Airport.

===Celebrations===
National Youth Day in India is observed on Vivekananda&#x27;s birthday (12 January). The day he delivered his speech at the Parliament of Religions (11 September) is observed as &quot;World Brotherhood Day&quot;. The 150th birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda was celebrated in India and abroad. The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports in India, officially observed 2013 as the occasion in a declaration.

===Movies===
Indian film director Utpal Sinha made a film, &quot;The Light: Swami Vivekananda&quot; as a tribute for his 150th birth anniversary. Other Indian films about his life include: &quot;Swamiji&quot; (1949) by Amar Mullick, &quot;Swami Vivekananda&quot; (1955) by Amar Mullick, &quot;Birieswar Vivekananda&quot; (1964) by Modhu Bose, &quot;Life and Message of Swami Vivekananda&quot; (1964) documentary film by Bimal Roy, &quot;Swami Vivekananda&quot; (1998) by G. V. Iyer, &quot;Swamiji&quot; (2012) laser light film by Manick Sorcar. &quot;Sound of Joy&quot;, an Indian 3D-animated short film directed by Sukankan Roy depicts the spiritual journey of Vivekananda. It won the National Film Award for Best Non-Feature Animation Film in 2014.

==Works==

Although Vivekananda was a powerful writer in English and Bengali, most of his published works were based on lectures given at various places around the world. Since most of these lectures were delivered spontaneously and with minimal preparation, his written style often retained the variability characteristic of his speech, and could be &quot;in turn discursive or expository, conversational or declamatory.&quot; His main work, &quot;Raja Yoga&quot;, consists of his own reworking of a series of talks delivered in New York.

&quot;Bartaman Bharat&quot;, meaning &quot;Present-day India&quot;, is a Bengali-language essay, first published in the March 1899 issue of &quot;Udbodhan&quot;, the Bengali-language magazine of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission. The essay was reprinted as a book in 1905 and later included in the fourth volume of &quot;The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda&quot;. In this essay, Vivekananda&#x27;s refrain to the readers is to honour every Indian as a brother, regardless of poverty, social status or caste.

<text>Abhay Charanaravinda Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (; ) (1 September 1896 – 14 November 1977) was a spiritual, philosophical, and religious teacher from India who spread the Hare Krishna mantra and the teachings of &quot;Krishna consciousness&quot; to the world. Born as Abhay Charan De and later legally named Abhay Charanaravinda Bhaktivedanta Swami, he is often referred to as &quot;Bhaktivedanta Swami&quot;, &quot;Srila Prabhupada&quot;, or simply &quot;Prabhupada&quot;.

To carry out an order received in his youth from his spiritual teacher to spread &quot;Krishna consciousness&quot; in English, in his old age, at 69, he journeyed in 1965 from Kolkata to New York City on a cargo ship, taking with him little more than a few trunks of books. He knew no one in America, but he chanted Hare Krishna in a park in New York City, gave classes, and in 1966, with the help of some early students, established the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), which now has centers throughout the world.

He taught a path in which one aims at realizing oneself to be an eternal spiritual being, distinct from one&#x27;s temporary material body, and seeks to revive one&#x27;s dormant relationship with the supreme living being, known by the Sanskrit name Krishna. One does this through various practices, especially through hearing about Krishna from standard texts, chanting mantras consisting of names of Krishna, and adopting a life of devotional service to Krishna. As part of these practices, Prabhupada required that his initiated students strictly refrain from non-vegetarian food (such as meat, fish, or eggs), gambling, intoxicants (including coffee, tea, or cigarettes), and extramarital sex. In contrast to earlier Indian teachers who promoted the idea of an impersonal ultimate truth in the West, he taught that the Absolute is ultimately personal.

He held the duty of a guru was to convey intact the message of Krishna as found in core spiritual texts such as the . To this end, he wrote and published a translation and commentary called &quot;Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is.&quot; He also wrote and published translations and commentaries for texts celebrated in India but hardly known elsewhere, such as the () and the , thereby making those texts accessible in English for the first time. In all, he wrote more than eighty books.

In the late 1970s and the 1980s, ISKCON came to be labeled a destructive cult by critics in America and some European countries. Although scholars and courts rejected claims of cultic brainwashing and recognized ISKCON as representing an authentic branch of Hinduism, the &quot;cult&quot; label and image have persisted in some places. Some of Prabhupada&#x27;s views or statements have been perceived as racist towards blacks, discriminatory against lower castes, or misogynistic. Decades after his death, Prabhupada&#x27;s teachings and the Society he established continue to be influential, with some scholars and Indian political leaders calling him one of the most successful propagators of Hinduism abroad.

== Early life (1896–1922) ==

Abhay Charan De was born in Calcutta (now Kolkata), India, on 1 September 1896, the day after Janmashtami (the birth anniversary of Krishna). His parents, Gour Mohan De and Rajani De, named him Abhay Charan, meaning &quot;one who is fearless, having taken shelter of Lord Krishna&#x27;s lotus feet&quot;. Following Indian tradition, Abhay&#x27;s father invited an astrologer, who predicted that at the age of seventy, Abhay would cross the ocean, become a famous religious teacher, and open 108 temples around the world.

Abhay was raised in a religious family belonging to the mercantile community. His parents were Gaudiya Vaishnavas, or followers of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who taught that Krishna is the Supreme Personality and that pure love for Krishna is the highest attainment.

Gour Mohan was a middle-income merchant and had his own fabric and clothing store. He was related to the rich and aristocratic Mullik mercantile family, who had been trading in gold and salt for centuries.

Opposite the De house was a temple of Radha-Krishna that for a century and a half had been supported by the Mullik family. Every day, young Abhay, accompanied by his parents or servants, attended temple services.

At the age of six, Abhay organized a likeness of the &quot;chariot festival&quot;, or Ratha-yatra, the huge &quot;Vaishnava&quot; festival held annually in the city of Puri in Odisha. For this purpose, Abhay persuaded his father to obtain for him a scaled-down copy of the massive chariot on which the form of Jagannatha (Krishna as &quot;Lord of the universe&quot;) rides in procession in Puri. Decades later, after going to America, Abhay would bring Ratha-yatra festivals to the West.

Though Abhay&#x27;s mother wanted him to go to London to study law, his father rejected the idea, fearing Abhay would be negatively influenced by Western society and acquire bad habits. In 1916 Abhay began his studies at the Scottish Church College, a prestigious school in Calcutta founded by Alexander Duff, a Christian missionary.

In 1918, while in college, Abhay, as arranged by his father, married Radharani Datta, also from an aristocratic family. They had five children over the course of their marriage. After graduation from college, Abhay began a career in pharmaceuticals and later opened his own pharmaceutical company in Allahabad.

Abhay grew up while India was under British rule, and like many other youth of his age he was attracted to Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s non-cooperation movement. In 1920, Abhay graduated from college with a specialization in English, philosophy, and economics. He successfully passed the final exams, but as a sign of opposition to British rule he refused to take part in the graduation ceremony and receive a diploma.

== Midlife (1922–1965) ==
In 1922, while still in college, Abhay was persuaded by a friend, Narendranath Mullik, to meet with Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati (1874–1937), a Vaishnava scholar and teacher and the founder of the Gaudiya Math, a spiritual institution for spreading the teachings of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. The word &quot;math&quot; denotes a monastic or missionary center. Bhaktisiddhanta was continuing the work of his father, Bhaktivinoda Thakur (1838–1914), who regarded Chaitanya&#x27;s teachings as the highest form of theism, intended not for any one religion or nation but for all of humanity.

When the meeting took place, Bhaktisiddhanta said to Abhay, &quot;You are an educated young man. Why don&#x27;t you take the message of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and spread it in English?&quot; However, Abhay, according to his own later account, argued that India first needed to become independent before anyone would take Chaitanya&#x27;s message seriously, an argument that Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati effectively countered. Convinced by Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, Abhay accepted the instruction to spread the message of Chaitanya in English, and it was in pursuing this order from Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati that he later traveled to New York. Many years later he recalled: &quot;I immediately accepted him as spiritual master. Not formally, but in my heart&quot;.

=== The Gaudiya Math and initiation (1933) ===
After meeting Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati in 1922, Abhay had little contact with the Gaudiya Math until 1928, when (renounced, itinerant preachers) from the Math came to open a center in Allahabad, where Abhay and his family were living. Abhay became a regular visitor, contributed funds, and brought important people to the lectures of the Math&#x27;s . In 1932, he visited Bhaktisiddhanta in the holy town of Vrindavan, and in 1933, when Bhaktisiddhanta came to Allahabad to lay the cornerstone for a new temple, Abhay received (spiritual initiation) from him and was given the name Abhay Charanaravinda.

Over the next three years, whenever Abhay was able to visit Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati in Calcutta or Vrindavan, Abhay would carefully listen to his spiritual master. In 1935, Abhay moved for business reasons to Bombay; then, in 1937, he moved back to Calcutta. In both places, he assisted other members of the Gaudiya Math by donating money, leading , lecturing, writing, and bringing others to the Math. At the end of 1936, he visited Vrindavan, where he again met Bhaktisiddhanta, who told him, &quot;If you ever get money, print books&quot;, an instruction that would inform his life&#x27;s work.

Two weeks before his death on 1 January 1937, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati wrote a letter to Abhay urging him to teach Gaudiya Vaishnavism in English. After Bhaktisiddhanta passed away, the unified mission of the Gaudiya Math broke down as a battle for power broke out between his senior disciples. Although Abhay continued to serve with other disciples of his spiritual master and wrote articles for their publications, he kept clear of the political struggles.

=== &quot;Bhaktivedanta&quot; title (1939) ===

In 1939, elders in the Gaudiya community honored Abhay Charanaravinda (A.C.) with the title &quot;Bhaktivedanta&quot;. In the title, means &quot;devotion&quot;, and means &quot;the culmination of Vedic knowledge&quot;. Thus the honorary title acknowledged his scholarship and devotion.

=== &quot;Back to Godhead&quot; magazine (1944) ===

In an effort to fulfill the order of his guru, in 1944, A.C. Bhaktivedanta began publishing &quot;Back to Godhead&quot;, an English fortnightly magazine presenting the teachings of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. He single-handedly wrote, edited, financed, published, and distributed the magazine, which is still published and distributed by his followers.

=== Accepting ===

In 1950, A.C. Bhaktivedanta accepted the (the traditional retired order of life), and went to live in Vrindavan, regarded as the site of Krishna&#x27;s &quot;Lila&quot; (divine pastimes), although he occasionally commuted to Delhi. In Mathura, adjoining Vrindavan, he wrote for and edited the magazine published by his godbrother Bhakti Prajnan Keshava.

=== Forming &quot;The League of Devotees&quot; (1952) ===

In 1952, A.C. Bhaktivedanta attempted to set up organized spiritual activities in the central Indian city of Jhansi, where he started &quot;The League of Devotees&quot;, only to see the organization collapse two years later.

=== Taking (1959) ===
On 17 September 1959, prompted by a dream of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati calling on him to accept (renounced order of life), A.C. Bhaktivedanta formally entered from Bhakti Prajnan Keshava at his Keshavaji Gaudiya Math in Mathura and was given the name Bhaktivedanta Swami. Wishing to preserve the initiatory name given him by Bhaktisiddhanta, as a sign of humility and connection to his spiritual master he kept the initials &quot;A.C.&quot; before his name, becoming A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.

=== Staying at the Radha Damodar temple (1962–1965) ===

From 1962 to 1965, Bhaktivedanta Swami stayed in Vrindavan at the Radha-Damodar temple. There he began the task of translating from Sanskrit into English and commenting on the 1800-verse (Bhagavata Purana), the foundational text of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. With great effort and struggle, he finally succeeded to translate, produce, raise funds for, and print the first of its twelve cantos, in three volumes.

=== Journey to the United States (1965) ===

After accepting &quot;sannyasa&quot;, Bhaktivedanta Swami began planning to travel to America to fulfill his spiritual master&#x27;s desire to spread Chaitanya&#x27;s teachings in the West.

To leave India, Bhaktivedanta Swami had many hurdles to overcome. He needed a sponsor in America, official approvals in India, and a ticket for his travel. After significant difficulties he managed to secure the needed sponsorship and approvals. He then approached one of his well-wishers, Sumati Morarjee, the head of the Scindia Steam Navigation Company, to ask for free passage to America on one of her cargo ships. Because of his age, she at first tried to dissuade him. Finally she relented and granted him a ticket on a freighter, the &quot;Jaladuta.&quot; Bhaktivedanta Swami began the 35-day journey to America on 13 August 1965, at the age of 69.

Bhaktivedanta took with him little more than a suitcase, an umbrella, some dry cereal, forty Indian rupees (about seven US dollars), and two hundred three-volume sets of his translation of the first canto of &quot;Srimad-Bhagavatam&quot;.

After surviving two heart attacks during his maritime journey, Bhaktivedanta Swami finally arrived at the Boston Harbor on 17 September 1965, and then continued on to New York City.

== Later years (1965-1977) ==

=== Beginnings in New York City ===

Bhaktivedanta Swami had no support or acquaintances in the United States except the Agarwals, an Indian-American family, who, although strangers to him, had agreed to sponsor his visa. Upon reaching New York, he took a bus to the town of Butler, Pennsylvania, where the Agarwals lived. In Butler he delivered lectures to different groups at venues such as the local YMCA.

After a month in Butler, he returned by bus to New York City. He stayed at various places — sometimes in a windowless room, sometimes a Bowery loft — until with the help of early followers he found a place to stay in the Lower East Side, where he converted a store-front curiosity shop at 26 Second Avenue with the serendipitous name “Matchless Gifts” into a small temple. There he offered classes on the &quot;Bhagavad-gita&quot; and other Vaishnava texts and held kirtan (group chanting) of the &quot;Hare Krishna mantra&quot;:

After he and his followers held Hare Krishna kirtan one Sunday under a tree in nearby Tompkins Square Park, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the event: “Swami’s Flock Chants in Park to Find Ecstasy; 50 Followers Clap and Sway to Hypnotic Music at East Side Ceremony”. He slowly gained a following, mainly from young people of the 1960s counterculture.

In contrast to the 1960s countercultural lifestyle, he required that in order to receive spiritual initiation his followers had to vow to follow four “regulative principles”: no illicit sex (that is, sex outside of marriage), no eating of meat, fish, or eggs, no intoxicants (including drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, and even coffee and tea), and no gambling. New initiates also vowed to daily chant sixteen meditative “rounds” of the Hare Krishna &#x27;mantra&#x27; (that is, to complete sixteen circuits of chanting the mantra on a 108-bead strand). During the first year in New York, he initiated nineteen people.

In July 1966, he incorporated the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON).

In December 1966, he made a recording of Krishna kirtan (along with a brief explanatory talk) that took the form of an album entitled &quot;Krishna Consciousness&quot;, released under the “Happening” record label. The record helped the early spread of what he called “the Hare Krishna movement”.

With his small band of followers in a little storefront, he was already sharing a vision of spreading “Krishna consciousness” around the world. He asked them to help, for example, by typing his manuscripts for the second canto of the &quot;Srimad-Bhagavatam&quot;. After he completed his &quot;Bhagavad-gita As It Is&quot; (by mid-January 1967), he asked a new disciple to find a publisher for it.

Bhaktivedanta Swami personally taught his first followers to spread Krishna’s message, prepare food to offer to Krishna, collect donations, and chant the Hare Krishna &quot;maha-mantra&quot; (“great mantra”) on the streets.

=== San Francisco ===

In 1967, Bhaktivedanta Swami established a second center, in San Francisco. The opening of the temple in the heart of the booming hippie community of Haight-Ashbury attracted many new adherents and was a turning point in his movement’s history, marking the beginning of rapid growth. To gain attention and raise funds, his disciples organized a two-hour concert with kirtan led by Bhaktivedanta Swami and rock performances by the Grateful Dead and other famous rock groups of the day. This “Mantra Rock Dance”, held at the popular Avalon Ballroom, attracted some three thousand people and brought attention to the local Hare Krishna temple. One commentator dubbed it the “ultimate high of that era”.
Later that year, Bhaktivedanta Swami’s followers organized San Francisco’s first Ratha Yatra, the festival he had celebrated as a child in imitation of the massive parade held annually in the Indian city of Puri. For this first San Francisco version, a flatbed truck with four pillars holding a canopy took the place of Puri’s three huge ornate wooden vehicles. He would later establish this annual festival in major cities around the world, with big vehicles —“chariots” — and thousands of people taking part.

At first, Bhaktivedanta Swami’s followers referred to him as “the Swami” or “Swamiji”. From mid-1968 onwards they called him “Prabhupada”, a respectful epithet that “enjoys currency with devotees and an increasing number of scholars”.

=== Great Britain and Europe ===

In 1968, Prabhupada asked three married couples among his disciples to open a temple in London, England. Following his instructions, the disciples, dressed in their robes and &quot;saris&quot;, began singing Hare Krishna regularly on London streets and at once attracted attention. Soon newspapers carried headlines like “Krishna Chant Startles London” and “Happiness is Hare Krishna”.

A further breakthrough came in December 1969 when the disciples managed to meet with members of the rock band the Beatles, who were at the peak of their global fame. Even before then, George Harrison and John Lennon had obtained a copy of the maha-mantra recording released by Prabhupada and his students in New York and had begun singing Hare Krishna.

In August 1969, Harrison produced a single of the Hare Krishna mantra, sung by the London disciples, and released it on Apple Records. For the recording, the disciples called themselves “The Radha Krishna Temple”. Harrison told a press conference convened by Apple that the Hare Krishna mantra was not a pop song but an ancient mantra that awakened spiritual bliss in the hearts of people listening to and repeating it. Seventy thousand copies of the record sold on the first day. It rose to number 11 on the British charts, and Prabhupada’s students performed live four times on the BBC’s popular TV show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. The record was also a success in Germany, Holland, France, Sweden, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia (as well as South Africa and Japan), and so the group was invited to perform in a number of European countries.The next year, 1970, Harrison produced with Prabhupada’s disciples another hit single, “Govinda”, and in May 1971 the album &quot;The Radha Krishna Temple&quot;. Also in 1970, Harrison sponsored the publishing of the first volume of Prabhupada’s book &quot;Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead&quot;, which related the activities of Krishna&#x27;s life as told in the tenth canto of the &quot;Srimad-Bhagavatam&quot;. In 1973 Harrison donated a seventeen-acre estate known as Piggots Manor, fifteen miles northwest of London. The Hare Krishna devotees converted this into a rural temple-ashram and renamed it Bhaktivedanta Manor in Prabhupada’s honor.

Once Prabhupada’s disciples had made a start in England, over the years Prabhupada visited England many times and from there traveled to Germany, France, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, leading kirtans, installing forms of Krishna in ISKCON temples, meeting religious and intellectual leaders and others keen to meet him, and guiding and encouraging his disciples.

=== Africa ===

In 1970, Prabhupada made the first of several visits to Kenya. Although the disciples he had sent there had settled into doing spiritual programs for the local Indian people, Prabhupada insisted on doing programs meant for Africans. On one notable occasion in Nairobi, when he was scheduled to do a program at an Indian Radha-Krishna temple in a mainly African area downtown, he ordered the doors opened to invite the local residents. Soon the hall was flooded with African people. Then he held &quot;kirtan&quot; and gave a talk. Prabhupada told his local leaders that they should spread Krishna consciousness among the local African people. Prabhupada also later visited Mauritius and South Africa and sent his disciples to Nigeria and Zambia.

=== The Soviet Union ===
Prabhupada’s visit to Moscow from 20 to 25 June 1971 marked the beginning of Krishna consciousness in the Soviet Union. During his five days in Moscow, Prabhupada managed to meet only two Soviet citizens: Grigory Kotovsky, a professor of Indian and South Asian studies, and Anatoly Pinyaev, a twenty-three-year-old Muscovite. Pinyaev, who went on to become the first Soviet Hare Krishna devotee, met Prabhupada through the son of an Indian diplomat stationed in Moscow. Prabhupada’s assistant gave Pinyaev a copy of Prabhupada’s &quot;Bhagavad-gita&quot;, which Pinyaev was able to translate into Russian, copy, and then distribute underground in the Soviet Union. Pinyaev showed a great interest in Gaudiya Vaishnavism, accepted initiation from Prabhupada, and did much to ignite interest in Krishna consciousness in the Soviet Union. Pinyaev was later imprisoned in Smolensk Special Psychiatric Hospital and forcibly treated with drugs for his practice of Krishna consciousness.

=== India ===

Having achieved some success in the West, in 1970 Prabhupada directed his attention especially to India, with the hope of turning India back toward its original spiritual sensibilities. He came back to India with a party of Western disciples — ten American &quot;sannyasis&quot; and twenty other devotees — and for the next seven years focused much of his effort on establishing temples in Bombay, Vrindavan, Hyderabad, and a planned international headquarters in Mayapur, West Bengal (the birthplace of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu).

By that time, Prabhupada saw that India had set a course towards Europeanization and sought to imitate the West. Therefore, the appearance on Indian soil of American and European Hare Krishna devotees who had rejected Western materialism and embraced Indian spiritual culture “caused nothing less than a sensation among the modernizing (i.e. Westernizing) Indians, planting seeds for an authentic religious revival there”.By the early 1970s, Prabhupada had established his movement’s American headquarters in Los Angeles and its world headquarters in Mayapur.

=== Around the world ===
In Latin America, Prabhupada visited Mexico and Venezuela. In Asia he visited Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. He also spent time in Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji. In the Middle East he visited Iran. Among the places he sent disciples to spread Krishna consciousness was China.

Early in the movement, Prabhupada had guided his students personally, but later, as the movement rapidly expanded, he relied more on letters and his secretaries. By giving his students instructions, advice, and encouragement, he ensured a “strong paternal presence” in their lives. He wrote more than six thousand letters, many now collected and kept in the Bhaktivedanta Archives. Besides receiving reports of accomplishments, he also had to deal through correspondence with almost daily setbacks, perplexities, quarrels, and failures. He tried to correct or resolve these as much as he could and kept on advancing his movement.

Wherever he was, he took an hour-long early-morning walk, which became a time for disciples to ask questions and receive personal guidance. On returning from his walk, he lectured daily on the &quot;Srimad-Bhagavatam&quot;, often reading from the portion of the manuscript he was working on. Every afternoon he met with disciples or with dignitaries and leaders from various parts of his mission.

Traveling constantly to lecture and tend to his disciples, Prabhupada circled the world fourteen times in ten years. He opened more than one hundred temples and dozens of farm communities and restaurants, as well as &quot;gurukulas&quot; (boarding schools) for ISKCON&#x27;s children. He initiated nearly five thousand disciples.

=== Death (1977) ===

On 14 November 1977, at the age of 81, after a long illness, Prabhupada passed away in his room at the Krishna Balaram Mandir, the temple he had established in Vrindavan, India. His burial site is located in the courtyard of the temple beneath a &quot;samadhi&quot; (memorial shrine) built by his followers.

=== Succession ===
In 1970, Prabhupada established a Governing Body Commission (GBC), then consisting of twelve leading disciples, to oversee ISKCON’s activities around the world and to serve as ISKCON’s ultimate managing authority. In 1977, four months before his death, he appointed eleven senior disciples to perform spiritual initiations on his behalf while he was ill.

Despite the measures Prabhupada took to organize the management of his movement, his death caused a crisis of authority in ISKCON that destabilized the organization and became a turning point in its development. The succession process was beset by conflicts, with disagreements persisting for decades. Nonetheless, by 2023 nearly one hundred disciples and grand-disciples in succession from Prabhupada were serving as initiating gurus in his branch of the Gaudiya Vaishnava lineage.

== Philosophy and teachings ==

Within Eastern systems, spiritual lineages are integral to each tradition, and a teacher is mandated to maintain theological fidelity by transmitting knowledge as given in the lineage. Prabhupada comes in the Brahma-Madhva-Gaudiya lineage, which traces back to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Madhvacharya, and further back, its teachings say, to the beginnings of creation. This lineage (&quot;sampradaya&quot;) follows such texts as &quot;Srimad-Bhagavatam&quot;, the &quot;Bhagavad-gita&quot;, and the writings of Chaitanya’s disciples and their followers. Prabhupada’s extensive commentaries on the sacred texts follow those of Bhaktisiddhanta, Bhaktivinoda, and other traditional teachers, such as Baladeva Vidyabhushana, Vishvanatha Chakravarti, Jiva Goswami, Madhvacharya, and Ramanujacharya.

=== The Absolute Truth ===
In accordance with the teachings of the &quot;Srimad-Bhagavatam&quot;, Prabhupada taught that the supreme truth, or Absolute Truth, is the one unlimited, undivided spiritual entity that is the source of all. That Absolute Truth, he taught, is realized in three phases: as &quot;Brahman&quot; (all-pervading impersonal oneness), as &quot;Paramatma&quot; (the aspect of God present within the heart of every living being), and as &quot;Bhagavan&quot;, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Though the Absolute Truth is one, he taught, that one Absolute is progressively realized in these three features according to one’s level of spiritual advancement. In the initial stage the Absolute is realized as Brahman, in a more advanced stage as Paramatma, and at the most advanced stage as &quot;Bhagavan&quot;.
=== Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead ===

In the &quot;Srimad-Bhagavatam&quot;, and so in Prabhupada’s teachings, Krishna is seen as the original and supreme manifestation of Bhagavan – in Sanskrit, &quot;svayam-bhagavan&quot;, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead himself. No one is equal to or greater than Krishna. Brahman and Paramatma are partial realizations of Krishna. The various Vishnu forms, such as Rama and Narasimha, are “nondifferent” from Krishna; they are the same Personality of Godhead, appearing in different roles. The form of Krishna is the original and the most complete form. In the Hindu pantheon, he taught the gods other than the Vishnu forms are demigods — that is, assistants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

=== The energies of the Absolute ===

If the Absolute Truth is one, this raises the question of how diversity can exist. If, as the &quot;Upanishads&quot; say, there is only the Absolute Truth and nothing else, we need some way to account for the existence of living beings, with all their differences, and the world, with all its many colors, forms, sounds, aromas, and so on. Prabhupada responds by referencing a statement from the &quot;Upanishads&quot; that the Absolute Truth has varied energies. As a fire located in one place gives off heat and light throughout a room, the Absolute Truth fills the world with every sort of variety.

=== Oneness and difference ===

Prabhupada taught Chaitanya’s doctrine of &quot;achintya bheda-abheda-tattva&quot;, in which everything is seen as simultaneously, inconceivably one with the Absolute — that is, with Krishna — and yet different. By way of analogy, Prabhupada gives the example that heat is in one sense identical with the fire from which it emerges and yet the two are different — when sitting in a fire’s warmth, we are not burning in the fire itself. This “oneness and difference” accounts for the oneness of an Absolute Truth that includes limitless varieties.

=== The inferior and superior energies ===

Among Krishna’s energies, Prabhupada taught, the ingredients of this world collectively belong to Krishna’s “inferior energy” — inferior in that, being inert matter, it lacks consciousness. But superior to inert matter are the conscious living beings (&quot;jivas&quot;) that belong to Krishna’s “superior energy”.

=== The predicament of the living being ===
Because the living beings belong to Krishna’s “superior energy”, Prabhupada taught, they share in Krishna’s divine qualities, including knowledge, bliss, and eternality (&quot;sat&quot;, &quot;cit&quot;, and &quot;ananda&quot;). But because of contact with the “inferior energy” since time immemorial, the divine nature of the living beings has been covered, and subjecting the living beings in this world to ignorance, suffering, and repeated birth and death. Living beings struggle against birth and death, disease, and old age in each life. While trying to control and enjoy the resources of nature, living beings increasingly suffer from entanglement in nature’s complexities.

As spiritual beings belonging to the “superior energy”, the living beings are different from their material bodies: the body may be male or female, young or old, white or black, American or Indian, but the living being within the body is beyond what he called these “material designations”. Prabhupada phrased this understanding in a maxim he often used: “I am not this body”.

He taught that when we falsely identify with these bodies, we are under the influence of Maya, or illusion. Only when this illusion is dispelled can the soul become liberated from material existence.

=== &quot;Bhakti&quot; ===
Prabhupada taught that living beings can be freed from illusion and from their entire material predicament by recognizing that they are tiny but eternal parts of Krishna and that their natural engagement lies in serving Krishna, just as a hand serves the body. Dormant within every living being, Prabhupada taught, is an eternal loving relationship with that Absolute, or Krishna, and when that loving relationship is revived, the living being resumes its natural eternal and joyful life. This eternal service in devotion to Krishna, rendered by one freed from all material designation, is called &quot;bhakti&quot;.One can begin practicing &quot;bhakti&quot;, Prabhupada taught, even while in the earliest stages of spiritual life. In this way, &quot;bhakti&quot; is both the end and how to achieve it. As a spiritual practice, &quot;bhakti&quot; is a powerful, transformative process that purifies the soul and enables it to see God directly.

=== Impersonalism ===

Prabhupada crusaded against what he called &quot;impersonalism&quot;—the idea that the Supreme has no form, qualities, activities, or personal attributes. In this way, he stood opposed to the teachings of Shankara (AD 788–820), who held that everything except Brahman is illusory, including the soul, the world, and God. Before Prabhupada, Shankara’s system of thought, known as &quot;Advaita Vedanta&quot;, had generally provided the framework for Western understandings of Hinduism, and the “steady procession of Hindu swamis” who came to America generally aligned themselves with Shankara’s monistic views and the idea of “the ultimate absorption of the self into an impersonal Reality or Brahman”.

But prominent Vaishnava philosophers from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, like Madhva and Ramanuja, had opposed Shankara’s views with personalistic understandings of Vedanta. Those teachers presented strong philosophical arguments criticizing Shankara’s “illusionism” (&quot;mayavada&quot;), his view that personal individuality, indeed all individuality, is illusory. Philosophers in the Gaudiya line such as, in the sixteenth century, Jiva Goswami had continued to argue formidably against impersonalism, which they regarded as &quot;the&quot; essential metaphysical misconception”. So Prabhupada strongly opposed impersonalistic views wherever he encountered them and asserted the eternal personal existence of the Absolute and of all living beings. Where Buddhism shares ground with Shankara’s views by teaching that ultimately personality disintegrates, leaving nothing but a void &quot;nirvana&quot;, Buddhism too came in for Prabhupada’s strong personalistic critique.

=== Societal organization ===
Prabhupada taught that society should ideally be organized in such a way that people have specific duties according to their occupation (&quot;varna&quot;) and stage of life (&quot;ashrama&quot;). The four &quot;varnas&quot; are intellectual work; administrative and military work; agriculture and business; and ordinary labor and assistance. The four &quot;ashramas&quot; are student life, married life, retired life, and renounced life. In accordance with the &quot;Bhagavad-gita&quot; and in opposition to the modern Hindu caste system, Prabhupada taught that one’s &quot;varna&quot;, or occupational standing, should be understood in terms of one’s qualities and the work one actually does, not by one’s birth.

Moreover, devotional qualifications always supersede material ones. Following Chaitanya, who challenged the caste system and undercut hierarchical power structures, Prabhupada taught that anyone could take to the practice of &quot;bhakti-yoga&quot; and become self-realized through the chanting of God’s holy names, as found in the &quot;Hare Krishna maha-mantra&quot;.

Prabhupada also emphasized the importance of self-sufficient farming communities as places where one could live simply and cultivate Krishna consciousness.
=== Spiritual practices ===

==== &quot;Kirtan&quot; ====
The primary spiritual practice Prabhupada taught was &quot;Krishna sankirtana&quot; (also called &quot;kirtan&quot; or &quot;kirtana&quot;), in which people musically chant together names of Krishna, especially in the form of the &quot;maha-mantra&quot;: &quot;Kirtan&quot; literally means “description” hence “praise”, and &quot;sankirtana&quot; indicates &quot;kirtan&quot; performed by people together.

On the authority of traditional Sanskrit texts, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu had taught that Krishna &quot;kirtan&quot; is the most effective method for spiritual realization in the present age (&quot;Kali-yuga&quot;) – more effective than silent meditation (&quot;dhyana&quot;), speculative study (&quot;jnana&quot;), worship in temples (&quot;puja&quot;), or performing the various physical or mental disciplines of &quot;yoga&quot;. &quot;Krishna kirtan&quot;, he had taught, can be done by anyone, anywhere, at any time, and without hard-and-fast rules. Because the names of Krishna are “transcendental sounds”, identical with Krishna himself, the chanting is spiritually uplifting.

When Prabhupada began his efforts to spread Krishna consciousness in the United States, he held &quot;kirtans&quot; in a Bowery loft, in his early storefront temples, in Tompkins Square Park in New York and Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, and wherever else he went. Following Prabhupada, his disciples soon began holding &quot;kirtans&quot; regularly in streets, parks, temples, and other venues in major cities in North America and Europe and then in Latin America, Australia, Africa, and Asia. Because of Hare Krishna &quot;kirtan&quot;, Prabhupada’s movement itself came to be referred to simply as “Hare Krishna” and its followers as “Hare Krishnas”.

Theologically speaking, the term &quot;sankirtana&quot; can extend from the public chanting of Hare Krishna to the distribution of books spoken by or about Krishna. &quot;Kirtan&quot; in the sense of public chanting is traditionally accompanied by &quot;kartals&quot; (hand cymbals) and mridangas (drums), and Prabhupada’s spiritual master and grand spiritual master had said that distribution of Krishna literature was the “great &quot;mridanga&quot;” because such distribution spreads Krishna consciousness still further. Prabhupada therefore gave great importance to such distribution.

==== Association with devotees ====

Prabhupada’s tradition constantly makes the point that “association with saints inspires saintliness, association with devotees inspires devotion. The association of genuine devotees can exert a powerful effect upon one&#x27;s consciousness”. And so when Prabhupada incorporated ISKCON, its founding document included as one the Society’s purposes “To bring the members of the Society together with each other and nearer to Krishna”.

==== Initiation vows ====

Prabhupada required of his followers, as a prerequisite for spiritual initiation, that they promise to follow four “regulative principles”: no illicit sex (that is, no sex outside of marriage), no eating of meat, fish, or eggs, no intoxicants (including drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, and even coffee and tea), and no gambling. New initiates also vowed to daily chant sixteen meditative “rounds” of the &quot;Hare Krishna mantra&quot; (that is, to complete sixteen circuits of chanting the mantra on a 108-bead strand).

==== Hearing of &quot;Srimad-Bhagavatam&quot; ====

For at least the last millennium, the &quot;Srimad-Bhagavatam&quot; has been “by far the most important work in the Krishna tradition” and “the scripture &quot;par excellence&quot; of the Krishnaite schools”. It is sometimes described as “the ripened fruit of the Vedic tree”. Accordingly, Prabhupada instituted daily classes on the &quot;Bhagavatam&quot; in all his centers, and he spoke on &quot;Bhagavatam&quot; daily, wherever he went.

==== Deity worship ====

In accordance with Vaishnava teachings, Prabhupada introduced the worship of Krishna in the form of a &quot;murti&quot;: figures cast in metal or carved in stone or wood to match descriptions of Krishna given in Vaishnava texts. Scholar of religion Kenneth Valpey writes: 
Prabhupada taught that because Krishna is personally present as the deity (the term Prabhupada used for such a form), worshiping the deity helps one develop loving exchanges with Krishna. Prabhupada installed deities in ISKCON temples worldwide.

Food prepared and offered to the deity of Krishna with devotion becomes sanctified as &quot;krishna-prasadam&quot; (&quot;mercy of Krishna&quot;). Prabhupada taught that eating only &quot;prasadam&quot; purifies one’s existence and helps one develop in &quot;bhakti&quot;. From the beginning of his mission, Prabhupada distributed &quot;prasadam&quot; to visitors and soon made it into the movement&#x27;s primary outreach vehicle. A weekly &quot;prasadam&quot; feast for the public has always been a program at all of ISKCON centers. Prabhupada wrote, “The Hare Krishna Movement is based on the principle: chant Hare Krishna mantra at every moment, both inside and outside of the temples, and, as far as possible, distribute prasadam&quot;.

==== Living in Vrindavan ====

Prabhupada’s predecessors such as Rupa Goswami had taught the value of living in Vrindavan (sometimes spelled “Vrindaban”), the sacred town between Agra and New Delhi that is held to be the site of Krishna’s rural “pastimes” on earth and therefore conducive to constant remembrance of Krishna. Prabhupada accordingly brought his disciples on pilgrimage to Vrindavan, and there, he established the Krishna-Balaram temple. Yet with a broader outlook, he wrote one disciple, “[W]herever you remain, if you are fully absorbed in your transcendental work in Krishna consciousness, that place is eternally Vrindaban. It is the consciousness that creates Vrindaban”.

== Principal writings ==

Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, who had specifically encouraged writing and publishing, at one meeting told Prabhupada: If you ever get money, print books. So regardless of how busy or sometimes unwell Prabhupada might have been, he remained focused on producing books. Prabhupada slept little, waking at 1:00 am every night to translate and comment on the &quot;Srimad-Bhagavatam&quot; and other texts. During the day he would give attention to guiding disciples and seeing to the affairs of his international society and its temples, and very early in the morning, while most people were asleep, he did most of his writing “because even with his age and uncertain health, he was unwilling to sacrifice his writing time for extra rest”.

By 1970, he had translated the &quot;Bhagavad-gita&quot;, two cantos of the &quot;Bhagavatam&quot;, a summary study of its tenth canto, and a summary volume drawn from the expansive Caitanya-caritamrta. Starting in 1970, his literary output slowed only slightly due to the demands of his expanding Hare Krishna movement. His task, as scholars have observed, was not merely to translate the text but to translate an entire tradition.

Historian of religion Thomas Hopkins relates that Prabhupada told him in a conversation in Philadelphia in 1975 that &quot;the &quot;Gita&quot; provided the basic education on Krishna devotion, the &quot;Srimad-Bhagavatam&quot; was like graduate study, and the &quot;Caitanya-caritamrita&quot; was like postgraduate education for the most advanced devotees”.

Hopkins says that by presenting in English such works as the &quot;Bhagavatam&quot; and &quot;Caitanya-caritamrta&quot;, Prabhupada made important texts accessible to the Western world that were simply not accessible before. Hopkins says, “[W]hat few English translations there were of the &quot;Bhagavata&quot; &quot;Purana&quot; and &quot;Caitanya-caritamrta&quot; were barely adequate and very hard to get hold of”. Prabhupada, Hopkins says, “made these and other texts available in a way that they never were before” and “made the tradition itself accessible to the West”.

=== &quot;Bhagavad-gita As It Is&quot; ===

In 1966-67, Prabhupada wrote a translation and commentary on the &quot;Bhagavad-gita&quot; he entitled &quot;Bhagavad-gita As It Is&quot;. It was first published by the Macmillan Company in 1968 in an abridged edition and later, in 1972, in full. For each verse he first gives the Sanskrit Devanagari script, then a roman transliteration and word-for-word gloss, followed by his translation and a commentary, or “purport”. Scholar of religion Richard H. Davis comments that this was “the first English translation of the &quot;Gita&quot; to supply an authentic interpretation from an Indian devotional tradition”. It is “by far the most widely distributed of all English Gita translations”. In 2015 Davis wrote, “The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust estimates that twenty-three million copies of Prabhupada’s translation have been sold, including the English original and secondary translations into fifty-six other languages”. For Prabhupada, Davis says, “the essential fact about the &quot;Bhagavad-gita&quot; is its speaker. The &quot;Gita&quot; contains the words of Krishna, and Krishna is the ‘Supreme Personality of Godhead.’” In Prabhupada’s view, other translations lack authority because the translators use them to express their own opinions rather than the message of Krishna. In contrast, Prabhupada saw his task in presenting what Krishna wanted to say, and so he claimed to present the &quot;Bhagavad-gita&quot; “as it is”.

=== &quot;Srimad-Bhagavatam&quot; ===
At once a sacred history, a theological treatise, and a philosophical text, the &quot;Srimad-Bhagavatam&quot; “stands out by reason of its literary excellence, the organization that it brings to its vast material, and the effect that it has had on later writers”. Praising the poetry of the &quot;Bhagavatam&quot;, scholar of religion Edwin Bryant says, “[S]cholars of the text have every right to say that ‘the &quot;Bhagavata&quot; can be ranked with the best of the literary works produced by mankind.’”
It was this great work that Prabhupada, after taking &quot;sannyasa&quot;, set out to present in English, with, once again, the original Sanskrit text, its word-for-word meanings, a translation, and an in-depth commentary. Also known as &quot;Srimad-Bhagavata&quot; &quot;Purana&quot;, &quot;Bhagavata&quot; &quot;Purana&quot;, or just the &quot;Bhagavata&quot; &quot;Srimad-Bhagavatam&quot; is a work of twelve books (“cantos” was the word Prabhupada used) comprising more than fourteen thousand verse couplets. “&quot;Srimad&quot;” means “beautiful” or “glorious”.

Prabhupada began his translation and commentary on the &quot;Bhagavatam&quot; after accepting &quot;sannyasa&quot; in 1959, and by 1965 he had completed and published the first canto. He worked on translating the &quot;Srimad-Bhagavatam&quot; into English for the rest of his life.

The cantos were published one by one, as he finished them. He completed nine cantos and thirteen chapters of the tenth. The rest of the &quot;Bhagavatam&quot; was completed by his disciples.

=== &quot;Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead&quot; ===

Considering his old age and the vast size of the &quot;Bhagavatam&quot;, Prabhupada knew he might not live to finish it. So in 1968 he undertook to present the &quot;Bhagavatam&quot;’s tenth canto — the essence of the work — in summary form as &quot;Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead&quot;.

This summary study is “Prabhupada’s own exposition of the story of Krishna as it is told in the Tenth Canto”. It “laid out the account of Krishna from the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; that provides the images and stories central to Krishna devotion”.

As Bryant says: Prabhupada himself inspired artists among his disciples to provide the text with profuse full-color illustrations. Such illustrations became a feature of nearly all his books.

A related work is &quot;Light of the Bhagavat&quot;, written by Prabhupada in Vrindavan in 1961, before he went to the West, but published only after his death. The book is a treatment of one chapter (chapter twenty) of the tenth canto. Prabhupada composed forty-eight commentaries for the chapter’s verses. The book is accordingly illustrated with forty-eight paintings.

=== &quot;Ishopanishad&quot; ===

In 1969 Prabhupada published, again in his full verse-by-verse format, his translation and commentary for the &quot;Ishopanishad&quot; — also known as the &quot;Īśa Upaniṣad&quot; or &quot;Īśāvāsya Upaniṣad&quot;, which in 1960 he had partially serialized in his &quot;Back to Godhead&quot; magazine. The &quot;Ishopanishad&quot;, consisting of only eighteen &quot;mantras&quot;, is considered one of the principal &quot;Upanishads&quot;. In all indigenous collections of the &quot;Upanishads&quot;, the &quot;Iśopaniṣad&quot; comes first. Its first verse, “highly regarded as a capsule of Vedic theology”, presents a god-centered view of the universe. The celebrated traditional commentator Shankara wrote, “One who is eager to rid himself of the suffering and delusion of saṁsāra, created by ignorance, and attain Supreme Bliss is entitled to read this &quot;Upaniṣad&quot;”.

=== &quot;The Nectar of Devotion&quot; ===

Begun in 1968, &quot;The Nectar of Devotion&quot; is a summary study of Rupa Goswami’s &quot;Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu&quot;, his “famous exposition of the principles of devotion”. Scholar-practitioner Shrivatsa Goswami has described &quot;Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu&quot; as “a textbook of devotional practice, an exposition on the philosophy of devotion, and a study of devotional psychology”. &quot;The Nectar of Devotion&quot; “gave access to Gaudiya Vaisnavism’s most important theological treatise on devotion”.

=== &quot;Caitanya-caritamrta&quot; ===

&quot;Caitanya-caritamrta&quot; is the seventeenth-century account of the life and teachings of Chaitanya, who founded the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition. Written in the Bengali language, it runs to more than 15,000 verses and “is regarded as the most authoritative work on Śrī Caitanya”, a work of “rare merit”, with “no parallel in the whole of Bengali literature”. Scholar of religion Hugh Urban calls it “one of the greatest works in all of Indian vernacular literature”.

Prabhupada completed his translation in 1974, within two years, and it was published in seventeen volumes, again with verse-by-verse text, transliteration, word meanings, translation and commentary. He based his commentary on the Bengali commentaries of his predecessors Bhaktivinoda Thakura and Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati.

Before Srila Prabhupada’s translation, the work in English was simply unavailable. After Prabhupada’s edition came out, scholar J. Bruce Long wrote, “The appearance of an English translation of Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī&#x27;s &quot;Śri Caitanya-caritāmṛta&quot; by A.C. Bhaktivedānta, Founder-Ācārya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, is a cause for celebration among both scholars in Indian Studies and lay-people seeking to enrich their knowledge of Indian spirituality”.

Several years earlier, in 1968, Prabhupada published &quot;Teachings of Lord Caitanya&quot;. The book offers a summary of selected portions of &quot;Caitanya-caritamrita&quot;.

=== &quot;The Nectar of Instruction&quot; ===

Prabhupada also wrote a verse-by-verse commentated translation of Rupa Goswami’s eleven-verse &quot;Upadeshamrita&quot;, one of Rupa Goswami’s shortest works, which provides concise directions on how to carry out devotional service.

=== Bhaktivedanta Book Trust ===

In 1972 Prabhupada founded the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust (BBT), which manages the international publishing and distribution of his writings. Apart from his major works, the BBT publishes various paperbacks derived from his lectures. The BBT also publishes &quot;Back to Godhead&quot;, the magazine Prabhupada founded, in multiple languages. Between 1973 and 1977, Prabhupada’s followers distributed several million books and other pieces of Krishna conscious literature every year in shopping malls, airports, and other public locations in the United States and worldwide. As of 2023, his books had been translated into eighty-seven languages. In 2022, the BBT printed more than two million pieces of literature.

== Critical assessments of Prabhupada’s writings ==

Shrivatsa Goswami has said, “Making these Vaiṣṇava texts available is one of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s greatest contributions. Apart from the masses, his books have also reached well into academic circles and have spurred academic interest in the Caitanya tradition”. Further, he says, “The significance of making these texts available is not merely academic or cultural; it is spiritual. &quot;Jñāna&quot;, knowledge, is spread, proper doctrines are made known, people come closer to reality”. Other academics, too, have applauded Prabhupada’s publications as his most significant legacy.

But his edition of &quot;Bhagavad-gita&quot;, in particular, has come in for criticism as well. Eric Sharpe, scholar of religion, considers Prabhupada’s reading of &quot;Bhagavad-gita&quot; single-minded and fundamentalist. Sanskrit scholar A.L. Herman concurs. Another scholar, K. P. Sinha, takes exception to Prabhupada’s “misinterpretations and unkind remarks” directed toward Advaita Vedanta, the philosophy of absolute monism.

The most detailed critical analysis by a Western, non-Hindu scholar comes from historian of religion Robert D. Baird. Baird takes upon himself the task of not merely seeing Prabhupada as “an authentic proponent of Vaishnavism” but of examining as an academic scholar the way Prabhupada reads the &quot;Bhagavad-gita&quot;.
Whereas many scholars, Baird writes, see “some degree of progression” in the &quot;Gita&quot;, with different themes emphasized in different parts of the book, Prabhupada “reads the complete teaching of the book, indeed of Vedic literature generally, into any passage”. It appears “that he considers it legitimate to interpret any verse in the light of the whole system found in the &quot;Gītā&quot; whether it is explicitly mentioned in that verse of the Gītā or not”. In this way, he reads “Krishna consciousness” even into portions of the text where Krishna is not explicitly mentioned. Prabhupada cites later passages in the &quot;Gita&quot; to explain earlier passages. Indeed, he even quotes from other texts in the canon (whether written before the &quot;Gita&quot; or after) to indicate the intention of the &quot;Gita&quot;, “as though they have the same authority as the &quot;Gita&quot; itself”. And so: “In all, a wide range of texts are used to serve as authorities for understanding the &quot;Gītā&quot;. Swami Bhaktivedanta not only treats specific texts in a way that would be unusual among Western scholars, but he sees specific texts in the light of the Vedas in general”.

Whereas other scholars, Baird writes, would give great attention to the overall structure of the &quot;Gita&quot;, Prabhupada gives the structure scant notice, preferring instead to make this point: “In every chapter of &quot;Bhagavad-gītā&quot;, Lord Kṛṣṇa stresses that devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life”.

Prabhupada uses the text of the &quot;Gita&quot; to present various aspects of Krishna theology. And “he also goes beyond specific texts and the &quot;Gītā&quot; itself when he makes it the occasion for the inculcation of a Vaishnava lifestyle,” typified by chanting the &quot;maha-mantra&quot;, regulating one’s sexual activity, offering food to Krishna, and following a vegetarian diet. And so: “Swami Bhaktivedanta is more interested in expounding the principles of Krishna consciousness than in merely explicating the text at hand”. In one instance cited, “the text recommends one thing [&quot;astanga-yoga&quot;] and Bhaktivedanta Swami cancels that and offers the &quot;mahāmantra&quot;”.

As for competing interpretations: “Bhaktivedanta often seeks to show the superiority of the Vaishnava position and the error of other positions”. “The position that is attacked with the most regularity and vigor is that of Advaita Vedanta,” “the system of thought that is commonly used to provide the structure for Western understandings of ‘Hinduism’”, whose advocates Prabhupada calls Mayavadins, impersonalists, or monists. For Advaita Vedanta he reserves his strongest condemnations.

Nor does Prabhupada only criticize “impersonalists”. Rather, “Scholars in particular come under Swami Bhaktivedanta’s condemnation because they are merely ‘mental speculators’”. In Prabhupada’s view, Baird says, “Since these scholars are not surrendered to Krishna, they are not Krishna conscious; they are merely offering their own ideas rather than the truth within the &quot;paramparā&quot; system [the lineage of masters and disciples]”. Prabhupada “seldom engages in the kind of argumentation that scholars are accustomed to when deciding between alternative positions”. Instead he takes a position as a spiritual master within the disciplic succession and “merely declares&quot; what is true. And so, Baird says, “The gulf between Swami Bhaktivedanta’s presentation and that of the scholarly exegete is simply unbridgeable, for their purposes operate on different levels”.

But what some scholars might see as faults, others see as virtues. Thomas Hopkins sees Prabhupada’s translations and purports as successfully conveying the meaning of the text precisely because Prabhupada draws upon the commentaries of his predecessors and brings to his work the understandings of his entire tradition. Moreover, Hopkins says, Prabhupada does this in such a way that the entire text becomes comprehensible to a modern reader, not only theoretically but practically. Translations of such texts as the &quot;Gita&quot;, Hopkins says, cannot be done mechanically. The translator has to understand the spirit and the experience that lie behind the text. Where Prabhupada’s translations expand the text, they do so “for the sake of making the meaning more clear, rather than obscuring it”. Hopkins says, “Writing a commentary is not a merely intellectual or academic exercise—it has a practical goal: to engage people with a living spiritual tradition”. Prabhupada, he says, brings the meaning of the text out of the past and into the present, giving it meaning in terms of people’s lives.

== Challenges and controversies ==

Prabhupada’s efforts to establish and expand Krishna consciousness included some difficulties internal to his new and growing movement. He had to train disciples unaccustomed to Vaishnava culture and philosophy and engage them in furthering his Hare Krishna movement; he had to set up and then guide his Governing Body Commission to see to ISKCON&#x27;s global management. He often had to intervene when clashes and controversies within ISKCON grew out of hand. He had to sort out difficulties faced by individual disciples, ensure a proper understanding of his teachings, and, more broadly, transplant an entire cultural movement. He also faced challenges from the outside world.

=== Cult image and “brainwashing” ===

Until the mid-1970s, the attitude of the Western public towards Prabhupada and his movement was cordial. News reports described Hare Krishna devotees, their beliefs, and their religious practices in a spirit of curiosity. By the mid-1970s, this changed. The rapidly expanding Hare Krishna movement — distinctive, foreign, highly visible, and vigorous (often over-vigorous) in spreading its message — became an early target for a nascent anti-cult movement. The Hare Krishna movement no longer represented an authentic spiritual tradition. Instead, it was now one of a myriad of &quot;destructive cults&quot; that won converts and took over their lives by “mind control” and “brainwashing”. When young adults, supposedly robbed of free will and “programmed” by mind control, became Hare Krishna devotees, some parents hired “deprogrammers” to kidnap them and “free them from the cult”. “Deprogrammings” typically involved days or weeks of isolation, browbeating, and intense verbal haranguing and harassment.

After one such deprogramming failed, the New York City District Attorney’s Office charged two local Hare Krishna leaders with illegally imprisoning two Hare Krishna followers by brainwashing them.

Prabhupada instructed his disciples to fight these charges, among other ways, by entering his books into evidence. Meanwhile, two hundred scholars signed a document defending ISKCON as an authentic Indian missionary movement.

In March of 1977, a New York State Supreme Court justice threw out the charges and recognized ISKCON as a bona fide religious tradition. Nonetheless, in America and Europe the “cult” label and image persisted for the rest of Prabhupada’s lifetime and beyond.

As scholar James Beckford notes, in the 1970s, Hare Krishna devotees became increasingly active in selling their literature and collecting donations from the public, so they were sharply criticized for what was seen as harassing people for money at airports and other public places. As Bryant and Ekstrand comment, “Questionable fund-raising tactics, confrontational attitudes to mainstream authorities, and an isolationist mentality, coupled with the excesses of neophyte proselytizing zeal, brought public disapproval” — something that Prabhupada had to deal with too.

=== Institutionalization ===

As ISKCON evolved towards being a worldwide organization, it suffered from the inevitable travails of institutionalization. Young disciples, mostly from an anti-establishment, anti-authoritarian background, became members of the GBC and found themselves running a worldwide institution. Preaching sometimes started giving way to revenue production; gender issues arose; leaders sometimes fell, and scandals broke out. Bureaucracy intruded on spontaneity, and many members left. As much as Prabhupada tried to leave management to the GBC, much of this he too had to deal with personally.

=== Child abuse ===

Prabhupada directed his disciples to train children in boarding schools called &quot;gurukulas&quot;, where they would receive education from spiritual teachers. However, as reported by sociologist of religion E. Burke Rochford, through mismanagement, these schools became like orphanages. After Prabhupada&#x27;s departure, it came to light that physical and sexual abuse occurred within these schools due to lack of oversight.

=== Obstacles in India ===

In India, Prabhupada faced a special set of challenges. He had much to accomplish there, but his American and European disciples were inexperienced in how to get things done in India and even how to live there.

When Prabhupada’s young American followers came to India in the early 1970s and began holding festivals, including public &quot;sankirtana&quot;, many Indians were surprised to see Westerners adopting Indian modes of worship and devotion. Some local people, including even some Indian officials, suspected that the American devotees must be undercover operatives of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

Outspoken and uncompromising as he was in the way he presented Krishna’s teachings in India, as elsewhere, Prabhupada found himself battling with opposing views of all sorts. Therefore, another challenge came from Prabhupada’s consistent rejection of the common Hindu notion of caste by birth. Since Prabhupada, like his predecessors, insisted that anyone, from any race or nation, could become spiritually purified and fit to perform the duties of priests, he faced opposition from Hindu brahmins who held that performing such duties was an exclusive birthright of their caste.

When Prabhupada resolved to build a temple on land in Juhu, Bombay (now Mumbai), the man who had sold ISKCON the land tried to swindle the devotees and take it back. The man had deep political connections in the Bombay municipality and employed lawyers and even thugs to drive the devotees off, but Prabhupada persisted and eventually won.

=== Deviations ===

While working to establish his movement, Prabhupada had to deal with problems caused even by leading disciples, who, monks or not, could still hold on to intellectual baggage, disdain for authority, and ambitions for power. In 1968 Prabhupada&#x27;s first &quot;sannyasi&quot; disciple openly disregarded Prabhupada’s instructions to him and twisted core tenets of Prabhupada’s teachings. This foreshadowed succession problems and issues of authority that Prabhupada’s movement would face both during Prabhupada’s presence and after.

Unlike Indian gurus who declared themselves &quot;avatars&quot;, divine appearances of God, Prabhupada, from the very beginning of his preaching, called himself only a servant or representative of God. But in 1970 four of Prabhupada’s early &quot;sannyasis&quot; announced at a large ISKCON gathering that Prabhupada’s followers had failed to recognize that Prabhupada was Krishna: God himself. Prabhupada expelled those &quot;sannyasis&quot; from his Society (he eventually readmitted them after they recanted their claim).

In 1972, without consulting Prabhupada, eight of the twelve members of the GBC held a meeting in New York aimed at centralizing control of ISKCON&#x27;s activities and finances. Their plans would have lessened Prabhupada&#x27;s own oversight and set aside his emphasis on the autonomy of each ISKCON center. This prompted Prabhupada to suspend the entire GBC &quot;until further notice&quot;, establish direct lines of communication with each temple&#x27;s leaders, and re-emphasize spiritual purity, the selfless and voluntary nature of devotional life, and the exemplary conduct befitting ISKCON leaders. He said he wanted this, not corporate bureaucracy and excessive centralization. (He later unsuspended the GBC).

In 1975, a clash broke out when a team of ten parties of itinerant &quot;sannyasis&quot;, assisted by two hundred &quot;brahmacharis&quot;, crisscrossed America, visiting ISKCON temples to extoll renunciation and a missionary spirit — and urge &quot;brahmacharis&quot; to abandon the temples and join the &quot;sannyasi&quot; parties. The temples, the team argued, were led by presidents who were &quot;grihasthas&quot; (married men), and grihasthas had a propensity for enjoyment that undermined what should be an austere temple atmosphere.

The conflict reached its peak in 1976 in Mayapur at ISKCON’s annual global gathering when a &quot;sannyasi&quot;-dominated GBC passed resolutions severely restricting the role of women and families in ISKCON. After hearing from both sides, Prabhupada came down against this type of discrimination, calling it “fanaticism”, and had the GBC undo the resolutions. Prabhupada said, &quot;I cannot discriminate — man, woman, child, rich, poor, educated, or foolish. Let them all come, and let them take Krishna consciousness&quot;.

=== Controversial views and statements ===

In the course of his preaching work in the West, Prabhupada made controversial statements that criticized various ideals of modern society or spoke offensively of certain groups.

&quot;In a traditional Hindu vein”, Prabhupada spoke favorably of the myth of Aryan bloodlines and compared darker races to &quot;shudras&quot; [people of low caste], thus implying them being inferior to the lighter-complexioned humans. In a recorded room conversation with disciples in 1977, he calls African Americans &quot;uncultured and drunkards&quot;, further stating that after being given freedom and equal rights, they caused a disturbance in the society.

Prabhupada called democracy &quot;the government of the asses&quot;, &quot;nonsense&quot;, and &quot;farce&quot;, at the same time praising the monarchial form of government and speaking favorably of dictatorship. While comparing Napoleon and Hitler to great demons of Hindu mythology Hiranyakashipu and Kamsa, he called their activities &quot;very great&quot;. On other occasions, he made &quot;generally approving remarks about Hitler&quot; and said that Hitler killed the Jews because they &quot;were financing against Germany&quot;. He also expressed some misogynistic views, asserting that &quot;women cannot properly utilize freedom and it is better for them to be dependent&quot;, stating that they are &quot;generally not very intelligent&quot;, and &quot;in general should not be trusted&quot;.

Scholars have commented, however, on the contrast between such controversial pronouncements and the full picture of what Prabhupada actually taught and did. Kim Knott, a religious studies scholar, extensively discusses Prabhupada’s statements about women. Describing her perspective about ISKCON as that of an “outsider” and a “western feminist”, she highlights Prabhupada&#x27;s firm belief that &quot;bhakti-yoga&quot;, the path of Krishna Consciousness, allows transcendence beyond gender distinctions. Knott emphasizes that, according to Prabhupada, women devotees, regardless of their gender, possess equal potential for spiritual advancement and service to Krishna. She further commends Prabhupada for opening up the Hare Krishna movement to women despite cultural norms and traditional prescriptions. In this way, she writes, Prabhupada took time, place, and circumstance into account and acted in the spirit of Krishna consciousness, “in the manner of Chaitanya”.

Commenting on the role and degree of responsibility that Prabhupada&#x27;s statements about women played in their abuse in ISKCON, E. Burke Rochford notes that Prabhupada’s personal example in dealings with his earliest women disciples was &quot;far more important&quot;. Their collective personal experiences, Rochford observes, portray Prabhupada’s &quot;respectful attitude and behavior toward his women disciples&quot; and his empowerment for the same rights and duties as his male disciples. Prabhupada encouraged and engaged women in conducting public scriptural discourses, &quot;kirtans&quot; and temple worship, writing for ISKCON magazines and publications, personally accompanying and assisting him, and assuming &quot;significant institutional positions in ISKCON&quot;.

Similarly, scholar of religion Akshay Gupta observes that Prabhupada did not regard his black disciples as lower or &quot;untouchables&quot;, displaying to some of them the same or even greater degree of affection than to his followers of other ethnicities. Another scholar of religion Mans Broo adds that when Prabhupada speaks about castes, he referred to an envisioned “ideal society” in which people would be divided into different occupational groups “based not on hereditary but on individual qualifications”.

Broo also notes that scholarly analyses attribute some of such statements to Prabhupada&#x27;s &quot;flair for drama and overstatement&quot; — particularly noting his penchant for making politically incorrect remarks to reporters and adding, “It is difficult to decide how seriously any single remark is meant to be taken from a transcript”. However, Broo concludes that this behavior does not clear Prabhupada from responsibility for his more radical, politically incorrect statements.
Another scholar of religion, Fred Smith, suggests that some of Prabhupada&#x27;s statements (such as those concerning Hitler) “must be understood in the context of the intellectual and political culture in which he matured” — specifically that of mid-twentieth-century Bengal, brewing with anti-colonialist nationalism championed by such figures as Subhash Chandra Bose, and therefore more favorably disposed to Nazi Germany than to Great Britain.

Broo notes that Prabhupada&#x27;s followers continue to grapple with his controversial statements — which paint &quot;a picture of a not very pleasant man, one far removed from the Gaudiya Vaishnava ideals described in the classical texts of the tradition&quot; — and respond to them in different ways: Some remain silent, while others invoke context or argue that Prabhupada is being unfairly quoted due to negative biases. Still, others are willing to differentiate between his statements they deem &quot;absolute&quot; and those they consider &quot;relative&quot;, acknowledging that some teachings may be contingent on the circumstances of Prabhupada&#x27;s life before coming to the US. However, some followers view this approach as &quot;exceedingly risky&quot;, questioning who has the authority to determine which teachings are relative and which are not. Therefore, Broo concludes, this issue is &quot;not likely to be resolved soon&quot;.

Commenting on the underlying causes for such controversies, scholar of religion Larry Shinn attributes the conflict between Prabhupada&#x27;s teachings and Western cultural values to &quot;[Prabhupada]&#x27;s insistence on the infallibility of the Krishna scriptures and (...) the authenticity of Prabhupada’s Krishna faith and practice&quot;.

== Influence ==

By explaining the teachings of bhakti yoga and Gaudiya Vaishnavism and arousing interest in them worldwide, Prabhupada made a lasting contribution. Through his writings and his movement, many Westerners have become aware of &quot;bhakti&quot; for the first time. He translated and commented on important spiritual texts, particularly the &quot;Bhagavad-gita&quot;, the &quot;Srimad-Bhagavatam&quot;, and the &quot;Caitanya-caritamrta&quot;, making these texts accessible to a global audience. His commentaries brought the traditional wisdom of these writings into a contemporary context, making possible a deeper comprehension of their spiritual meaning and its practical application in one’s life. Within Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Prabhupada&#x27;s preaching achievements are viewed as the fulfillment of a mission to introduce Caitanya Mahaprabhu&#x27;s teachings to the world.

Although the “steady procession of Hindu swamis” who had come to America before Prabhupada had generally aligned their views with the monistic Advaita Vedanta of Shankara (AD 788‒820) and the idea of “the ultimate absorption of the self into an impersonal Reality or Brahman”, Prabhupada rejected Advaita Vedanta and coherently argued that the Absolute is ultimately the Personality of Godhead.

Sardella has written that in the twelve years between Prabhupada’s arrival in America and his demise, Prabhupada “managed to build ISKCON into an institution comprising thousands of dedicated members, establish Caitanya Vaishnava temples in most of the world’s major cities, and publish numerous volumes of Caitanya Vaishnava texts (in twenty-eight languages), tens of millions of which were distributed throughout the world”. Prabhupada also spread the chanting of the &quot;Hare Krishna mantra&quot; worldwide.

In 2013, Rochford wrote, “[T]he fact that ISKCON has survived for nearly 50 years, despite significant change, is a testament to the devotees’ resilience and to the power of Prabhupada’s teachings and vision for ISKCON”.

In India, Prabhupada’s movement has become a well-respected institution, with recognition at all levels of Hindu society. ISKCON has large temple complexes active in cities like Mumbai, New Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, and Kolkata. ISKCON’s center in Mayapur has become an Eastern Indian place of pilgrimage for millions every year. Thousands of middle-class Hindus, both in India and elsewhere, have joined ISKCON. And Hindus both in India and in the Hindu diaspora have provided ISKCON vast support.

But Prabhupada&#x27;s legacy also faces scrutiny on various fronts. Criticisms have emerged regarding the movement&#x27;s organizational structure, controversies have arisen surrounding continuity of leadership after his passing, and misdeeds and even criminal acts have been committed by some ISKCON members, including once-respected former leaders. Concerns have been expressed about the movement&#x27;s adaptability to modern values, especially concerning gender roles and societal norms. And although ISKCON has benefited from the support and participation of a large and growing number of Indian families in its congregations outside India, the “Hinduization” of ISKCON has in many places tended to diminish the involvement of other audiences.

Nonetheless, Prabhupada&#x27;s influence endures through his writings and ISKCON&#x27;s ongoing activities. Despite significant setbacks, the movement he started continues to grow.

== Recognition ==
=== From scholars ===

Kim Knott writes that scholars describe Prabhupada as a charismatic spiritual leader and emphasize his “humanity” and “uniqueness”. Prabhupada’s missionary successes in such a short period, and at such an advanced age, she writes, are extolled by scholars using terms such as “stunning”, “remarkable”, and “extraordinary”. In the same vein, Klaus Klostermaier, scholar of Hinduism and Indian history, refers to Prabhupada as &quot;probably, the most successful propagator of Hinduism abroad&quot;.

Representing such thoughts, Harvey Cox, American theologian and Professor of Divinity Emeritus at Harvard University, said:

=== From officials ===

Prabhupada&#x27;s success in spreading Indian spirituality among non-Indians across the world brought him acclaim from Indian political leaders.

Indian Prime Ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Deve Gowda, Narendra Modi, and Indian Presidents Shankar Dayal Sharma, Pranab Mukherjee, and Pratibha Patil have praised Prabhupada, his work and mission.In 1998, speaking at the opening ceremony of an ISKCON temple in New Delhi, Prime Minister Vajpayee credited Prabhupada&#x27;s movement with publishing the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; &quot;in millions of copies in scores of Indian languages&quot; and distributing it &quot;in all nooks and corners of the world&quot;, calling Prabhupada&#x27;s journey to the West and the rapid global propagation of his movement &quot;one of the greatest spiritual events of the century&quot;.

Releasing a 125-rupee commemorative coin on the occasion of Prabhupada&#x27;s 125th birth anniversary, Prime Minister Modi also praised Prabhupada for his efforts “to give India’s most priceless treasure to the world”, describing Prabhupada&#x27;s accomplishments in spreading the thought and philosophy of India to the world as “nothing less than a miracle.”

On the fiftieth anniversary of Prabhupada’s voyage to the West, US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard praised the &quot;compassion that drove Srila Prabhupada to attempt something so brave and so daring to deliver the message of Lord Chaitanya and the Holy Name to all of mankind&quot;.

Prabhupada was conferred with the title &quot;Vishwa Guru&quot; by the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad during the 2025 Prayag Maha Kumbh Mela in Uttar Pradesh in recognition of his contributions to humanity and his efforts in spreading Indian culture, traditions and &quot;spiritual wisdom to every corner of the world&quot;.

== Commemoration ==

=== Shrines, memorials, museums ===

In keeping with &quot;Gaudiya-Vaisnava&quot; rites, after Prabhupada&#x27;s death at the Krishna-Balarama temple in Vrindavan (Uttar Pradesh, India), his disciples interred his body on the temple premises and erected a marble &quot;samadhi&quot;, or shrine, over his burial site. In Mayapur (West Bengal), they built a much larger &quot;pushpa-samadhi&quot; — a shrine sanctified with flowers from Prabhupada&#x27;s burial ceremony. Daily &quot;puja&quot; (traditional worship) is offered to larger-than-life statues of Prabhupada at both sites.

Another shrine is dedicated to Prabhupada in New Vrindaban (West Virginia, USA), where a residence built to host Prabhupada during his occasional visits evolved into the elaborate Prabhupada&#x27;s Palace of Gold. After opening to the public in 1979, two years after Prabhupada’s death, the memorial site is now a place of worship and an attraction for pilgrims and tourists, listed in America’s National Register of Historic Places. Other rooms ‌in which Prabhupada stayed while in Vrindavan, Mumbai, Los Angeles, London, Melbourne and several other places around the world have been preserved as museums.

Prabhupada’s birthplace, in the Tollygunge neighborhood of Kolkata, was inaugurated as a memorial site in 2001, on the 125th anniversary of Prabhupada’s birth, by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. In the Ultadanga neighborhood of Kolkata, the building, known as Bhaktivinode Asan where Prabhupada first met his guru, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, has also been restored as a heritage site.
On August 13, 2015, the fiftieth anniversary of Prabhupada’s departure from Kolkata to the United States, a two-meter-high bronze monument, created by Ukrainian sculptor Volodymyr Zhuravel, was unveiled in Kolkata by the Governor of West Bengal Keshari Nath Tripathi and Lieutenant Governor of Pondicherry Kiran Bedi. The monument was created in two parts — one depicting Prabhupada’s departure for America, the other his arrival. After the monument was unveiled, the “departure” part was installed at the ISKCON temple in Kolkata, the “arrival” part in front of the ISKCON temple in Boston.

In November 2024, Scottish Church College inaugurated the &quot;Abhay Charan Seminar Hall&quot;, honoring A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. The hall was constructed with support from the Bhaktivedanta Research Centre.

=== Biographies, memoirs, diaries ===

In 2008, Ketola wrote that there were more than thirty historical, biographical, and autobiographical works centering on Prabhupada. Since then they have increased.

Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami’s official six-volume biography &quot;Srila Prabhupada-lilamrta&quot; (“carefully researched”, Ketola reports) has more recently been joined by a shorter biography, &quot;Swami in a Strange Land&quot;, by Joshua Greene. Both authors are Prabhupada’s disciples. Among memoirs that focus on specific times or places, Ketola mentions several, including Hayagriva Dasa’s &quot;The Hare Krishna Explosion&quot;.)

Ketola also notes two published diaries kept by direct assistants of Prabhupada: Tamal Krishna Goswami’s &quot;TKG’s Diary&quot; and Hari Sauri Dasa’s multi-volume &quot;Transcendental Diary&quot;.

=== Film, and filmed memoir collections ===

In 1996 Gaurav Seth produced the fifty-five-minute biographical film &quot;Prabhupada: A Lifetime in Preparation&quot;. In 2017 John Griesser, a Prabhupada disciple, produced an uncritical 91-minute film: &quot;Hare Krishna! The Mantra, the Movement, and the Swami who started it All&quot;.

Disciples have also undertaken two video projects collecting memories of Srila Prabhupada, one entitled &quot;Remembering Srila Prabhupada&quot;, the other &quot;Following Srila Prabhupada&quot;.

The Bhaktivedanta Archives, in North Carolina, serves as a repository for Srila Prabhupada’s manuscripts and letters, for photographs of Srila Prabhupada, and for audio recordings.
=== Stamps, coin, and plaque ===

In 1996, the Government of India issued a commemorative stamp in Prabhupada’s honor and in 2021 a 125-rupee commemorative coin.

In 2001, the City of New York installed a plaque in Tompkins Square Park to mark the “Hare Krishna tree”, the elm under which Prabhupada and his early followers first began chanting the &quot;Hare Krishna mantra&quot; in 1966.
=== Schools ===

Various ISKCON-related schools and other institutions have been named after Srila Prabhupada, including the Bhaktivedanta Research Centre in Kolkata, which holds a full collection of the works of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati as well as publications from the first twenty years of the Gaudiya Math.

In 2023, Scottish Church College and the Bhaktivedanta Research Center jointly established the &quot;A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada Memorial Award&quot; to commemorate Prabhupada&#x27;s student years at the college, meant to recognize both the most meritorious student for outstanding academic achievements and a faculty member for exceptional community service.

=== Roads ===

In 1978, a prominent entrance road into Vrindavan was named Bhaktivedanta Swami Marg after Prabhupada.

<text>The Primary Chronicle, shortened from the common Russian Primary Chronicle (, commonly transcribed Povest&#x27; vremennykh let (PVL), ), is a chronicle of Kievan Rus&#x27; from about 850 to 1110. It is believed to have been originally compiled in or near Kiev in the 1110s. Tradition ascribed its compilation to the monk Nestor (Nestor&#x27;s Chronicle) beginning in the 12th century, but this is no longer believed to have been the case.

The title of the work, (&quot;Tale of Bygone Years&quot;) comes from the opening sentence of the &quot;Laurentian&quot; text: &quot;These are the narratives of bygone years regarding the origin of the land of Rus&#x27;, the first princes of Kiev, and from what source the land of Rus&#x27; had its beginning&quot;. The work is considered a fundamental source for the earliest history of the East Slavs.

The content of the chronicle is known today from the several surviving versions and codices, revised over the years, slightly varying from one another. Because of several identified chronological issues and numerous logical incongruities pointed out by historians over the years, its reliability as a historical source has been strictly scrutinized by experts in the field. (See .)

== Authorship and composition ==
=== Authorship ===
Tradition long regarded the first compilation as the work of a monk named Nestor ( 1056 – 1114), known to have written other works such as &quot;Life of the Venerable Theodosius&quot;. Writers of the time spoke of the &quot;Chronicle of Nestor&quot;, and of the author as Nestor &quot;the Chronicler&quot;. Based on the 1661 &quot;Paterik&quot; of the Kyiv Monastery of the Caves, late 17th-century writers began to assert that Nestor &quot;the Chronicler&quot; wrote many of the surviving Rus&#x27; chronicles, including the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, the &quot;Kievan Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Galician–Volhynian Chronicle&quot;, even though many of the events they described took place in the 12th and 13th century, long after Nestor&#x27;s death 1114. Another reason given for belief in Nestorian authorship was the word нестера in the opening lines of the &quot;Khlebnikov Codex&quot; (discovered in 1809), which some readers took to refer to Nestor &quot;the Chronicler&quot;. But as Ostrowski (1981) pointed out: &quot;The word нестера was added in the &quot;Khlebnikov Codex&quot;, and thus cannot be used as evidence for the name of the compiler of the PVL.&quot; The word is not found in any of the other five main versions of the PVL, and is thus an interpolation inserted into the text by an editor, perhaps guessing at the author&#x27;s name. From the 1830s to around 1900, there was fierce academic debate about Nestor&#x27;s authorship, but the question remained unresolved, and belief in Nestorian authorship persisted. The internal evidence of the PVL and the known works of Nestor often contradict one another, while the contents barely coincide in places where they seemingly should, so modern scholars have concluded that Nestor was not the author.

A more likely candidate as author is Sylvester of Kiev, hegumen (abbot) of the St. Michael&#x27;s Monastery in Vydubychi (a village near Kyiv), who may have compiled several sources in the year 1116. This attribution is based on the fact that the &quot;Laurentian&quot; text ends on page 286, lines 1 to 7, with the colophon &quot;I wrote down (&quot;napisakh&quot;) this chronicle&quot;, after which he requests the readers to remember him in their prayers. Alternately, the real author may have been some other unnamed monk from the Kyiv Monastery of the Caves mentioned in the title, and Sylvester completed his work, or was a very early editor or copyist of the PVL.

=== Editions ===
Wladyslaw Duczko (2004) argued that one of the central aims of the &quot;Chronicle&#x27;s&quot; narrative is to &#x27;give an explanation how the Rurikids came to power in the lands of the Slavs, why the dynasty was the only legitimate one and why all the princes should terminate their internal fights and rule in peace and brotherly love.&#x27; 

In the year 1116, Nestor&#x27;s text was extensively edited by the hegumen Sylvester who appended his name at the end of the chronicle. As Vladimir II Monomakh was the patron of the village of Vydubychi (now a neighborhood of Kyiv) where Sylvester&#x27;s monastery was situated, the new edition glorified Monomakh and made him the central figure of later narrative. This second version of Nestor&#x27;s work is preserved in the Laurentian Codex (see ).

A third edition followed two years later, centered on Monomakh&#x27;s son and heir, Mstislav the Great. The author of this revision could have been Greek, for he corrected and updated much data on Byzantine affairs. This revision of Nestor&#x27;s work is preserved in the Hypatian Codex (see ).

=== Composition ===
The organization, style, and narrative flow of the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; shows signs of compilation, different historical elements are brought together into a single cohesive historical account. Studies by Russian philologist Aleksey Shakhmatov and his followers have demonstrated that the &quot;PVL&quot; is not a single literary work but an amalgamation of a number of ancestors accounts and documents. In compiling the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, some of Nestor&#x27;s original sources definitely included but were not limited to:

* The chronological table in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; was derived from the &quot;Chronographikon Syntomon&quot; written by patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople (died 829)
* the Byzantine annals of John Malalas, a Greek chronicler, who in 563 produced an 18+book work of myth and truth intertwined.
* the Byzantine annals of the monk George Hamartolus (literally &quot;the Sinner&quot;, as he called himself; also known as &quot;George the Monk&quot;) who tried to adhere strictly to truth, and whose works are the only contemporary source for the period 813–842
*byliny, traditional East Slavic oral epic narrative poems
*Norse sagas
* several Greek religious texts
*Rus&#x27;–Byzantine treaties 
* oral tradition, but how much &quot;is very difficult to tell&quot;. 
There probably were no &quot;earlier local chronicles&quot;. The hypothesis that a local chronicle was written before the late 980s at the St Elias church in Kiev &quot;has to remain an unproven speculation&quot;.

Linguistically speaking, the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; is written in Old East Slavic, with strong Old Church Slavonic (early South Slavic) elements. Although these two languages were quite similar up to the early 12th century, with few phonological, morphological and lexical differences at that point, scholars have noted a general pattern of religious passages and moral teachings featuring strong Old Church Slavonic elements, whereas entries on events in specific years are dominated by Old East Slavic elements. Nevertheless, there are no clear linguistic boundaries between the two, as profane (secular) passages sometimes feature Old Church Slavonicisms, while devotional passages sometimes feature Old East Slavicisms. In the view of many modern linguistics, the authors (and editors) of the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; probably considered the language they wrote in to be one single language. However, this literary language likely differed significantly from the Old East Slavic spoken lingua franca in contemporary Kiev, which appears to have been an amalgamation of several Old East Slavic dialects, with relatively few Old Church Slavonic influences.

== Surviving manuscripts ==
Because the original of the chronicle as well as the earliest known copies are lost, it is difficult to establish the original content of the chronicle. The six main manuscripts preserving the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; which scholars study for the purpose of textual criticism are:
* &quot;Laurentian Codex&quot; (1377)
* &quot;Hypatian Codex&quot; ( 1425)
* &quot;Radziwiłł Chronicle&quot; ( 1500)
* &quot;Academic Chronicle&quot; ( 1500)
* &quot;Khlebnikov Codex&quot; ( 1575)
* &quot;Trinity Chronicle&quot; ( 1450; excluded by some scholars who count only &quot;five main witnesses&quot;)

=== Laurentian Codex ===
The &quot;Laurentian Codex&quot; was compiled in Nizhny Novgorod-Suzdal by the Nizhegorodian monk Laurentius for the Prince Dmitry Konstantinovich in 1377. The original text he used was a codex (since lost) compiled in 1305 for the Grand Prince of Vladimir, Mikhail of Tver. The account continues until 1305, but the years 898–922, 1263–83 and 1288–94 are missing for reasons unknown. The manuscript was acquired by the famous Count Musin-Pushkin in 1792 and subsequently presented to the National Library of Russia in Saint Petersburg.

=== Hypatian Codex ===
The Hypatian Codex dates to the 15th century. It incorporates much information from the lost 12th-century &quot;Kievan Chronicle&quot; and 13th-century &quot;Galician–Volhynian Chronicle&quot;. The language of this work is the East Slavic version of Church Slavonic language with many additional irregular east-slavisms (like other east-Slavic codices of the time). Whereas the Laurentian (Muscovite) text traces the Kievan legacy through to the Muscovite princes, the Hypatian text traces the Kievan legacy through the rulers of the Halych principality. The Hypatian codex was rediscovered in Kiev in the 1620s, and a copy was made for Prince Kostiantyn Ostrozhsky. A copy was found in Russia in the 18th century at the Ipatiev Monastery of Kostroma by the Russian historian Nikolai Karamzin.

Numerous monographs and published versions of the chronicle have been made, the earliest known being in 1767. Aleksey Shakhmatov published a pioneering textological analysis of the narrative in 1908. Dmitry Likhachev and other Soviet scholars partly revisited his findings. Their versions attempted to reconstruct the pre-Nestorian chronicle, compiled at the court of Yaroslav the Wise in the mid-11th century.

The early part of the &quot;PVL&quot; features many anecdotal stories, among them:

* The supposed biblical origins of the Slavs from a son of Noah mentioned in the Hebrew Bible;
* the early history of the Slavs, with the banks of the river Danube in the regions of Hungary, Illyria, and Bulgaria described as their place of original settlement; 
* the legendary founding of Kiev by Kyi, Shchek, Khoryv and Lybid&#x27;;
* the labors of Saints Cyril and Methodius among the Slavic peoples;
* the calling of the Varangians;
* the murder of Askold and Dir, by which Oleg the Wise conquered Kiev;
* the death of Oleg in 912, the &quot;cause&quot; of which was allegedly foreseen by him;
* the legendary vengeance taken by Olga, the wife of Igor, on the Drevlians, who had murdered her husband; (Her actions secured Kievan Rus&#x27; from the Drevlians, preventing her from having to marry a Drevlian prince, and allowing her to act as regent until her young son came of age.)
* the Siege of Kiev (968) by the Pechenegs;
* the legendary Conversion of Vladimir the Great;
* the Kievan succession crisis after Vladimir&#x27;s death, Yaroslav&#x27;s rise to power, and the Battle of Listven.

Women play a relatively minor role in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, usually only as the unnamed wife or daughter of a named man. There are very few women mentioned by their full personal (Christian) names in the PVL, including: Princess Olga of Kiev, abbess Ianka or Anna Vsevolodovna of Kiev, her sister Eupraxia Vsevolodovna of Kiev (alias Holy Roman Empress Adelheid), Predslava Volodimerovna, Predslava Sviatopolkovna of Kiev, and Catherine (Katerina) Vsevolodovna (died 1108).

=== Chronology ===
The chronology offered by the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; (&quot;PVL&quot;) is sometimes at odds with that of other documents such as the &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot; (&quot;NPL&quot;) and Byzantine literature. Sometimes the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; also contradicts itself, especially between narrative and chronological parts, which appear to have been written by two different authors. Several scholars including Aleksey Shakhmatov (1897), Mikhail Tikhomirov (1960), Ia. S. Lur’e (1970), and Constantin Zuckerman (1995) have concluded that the 9th- and 10th-century dates mentioned in the &quot;PVL&quot; were not added to the text until the 11th century, unless directly copied from the &quot;Chronicle&quot; of George the Monk.

==== Opening date error ====
The historical period covered in the &quot;Tale of Bygone Years&quot; begins with biblical times, in the introductory portion of the text, and concludes with the year 1117 in the chronicle&#x27;s third edition. Russian philologist Aleksey Shakhmatov was the first one to discover early on that the chronology of the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; opens with an error. The &quot;Laurentian&quot; text of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; says: &quot;In the year 6360 (852), the fifteenth of the indiction, at the accession of the Emperor Michael, the land of Rus&#x27; was first named&quot;. It is thus claimed that the reign of Byzantine emperor Michael III began in this year, but Byzantine sources (such as 11th-century Greek historian John Skylitzes&#x27; account ) point out that it began on 21 January 842. Shakhmatov (1897) demonstrated that an editor based himself on a miscalculation found in the &quot;Short History&quot; of Nikephoros I of Constantinople. Moreover, a few sentences later, the text states: &#x27;from the birth of Christ to Constantine, 318 years; and from Constantine to Michael, 542 years. Twenty-nine years passed between the first year of Michael&#x27;s reign and the accession of Oleg, Prince of Rus&#x27;.&#x27; However, Constantine the Great acceded in 313, not 318, and the resulting sum of 318+542 years leads to another erroneous accession of Michael III, this time in 860. This then leads to an internal contradiction, when &quot;Michael the Emperor&quot; is said to have mounted a campaign against the Bulgars in 853–858 (6361–6366), which could not have happened before he became Byzantine emperor in 860 according to the latter accession date.

==== Major events ====
Chronology of major events:
* 852 (6360): The principal date mentioned in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, when the land of Rus&#x27; was first named in the Greek chronicle of George Hamartolos; this is evidence that the compiler used it as one of the sources for the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;.
* 859: &#x27;The Varangians from beyond the sea imposed tribute upon the Chuds, the Slavs, the Merians, the Ves&#x27;, and the Krivichians. But the Khazars imposed it upon the Polyanians, the Severians, and the Vyatichians&#x27;.
* 862: The calling of the Varangians. The various tributaries of the Varangians attempted to rid themselves of the Varangian lordship, which led to quarrels among the tribes and culminated in them inviting a &quot;knyaz&quot; (&quot;prince&quot;) from the Varangians to rule over them. As a result, the three Varangian brothers Rurik, Sineus and Truvor and their kinsfolk crossed the sea and settled themselves in various localities, and it is claimed that it was after these Varangians that the land of Rus&#x27; would eventually be named. Around the same time, two other Varangians called Askold and Dir captured the town of Kiev.
* 866 (6374): The Siege of Constantinople (860) by Rus&#x27; forces. According to Byzantine sources, this happened in 860, not 866.
* 881/2 (6390): Rurik&#x27;s successor, Oleg, sent messengers to Askold and Dir, representing himself as a stranger on his way to Greece on an errand for Oleg and for Igor&#x27;, the prince&#x27;s son, requesting a meeting. He then ambushed Askold and Dir, saying: &quot;You are not princes nor even of princely stock, but I am of princely birth.&quot; Igor&#x27; was then brought forward, and Oleg announced that he was the son of Rurik. They killed Askold and Dir, and after carrying them to the hill, they buried them there, on the hill now known as Uhorska (Hungarian hill), where the castle of Ol&#x27;ma now stands.&#x27; Then &#x27;Oleg set himself up as prince in Kiev&#x27; () &#x27;and declared that it should be the mother of Rus&#x27; cities.&#x27; According to the text&#x27;s aforementioned chronology of Oleg&#x27;s accession 29 years after Michael III in 860, Oleg&#x27;s reign should have begun in 889 rather than 881/2.
* 883: Prince Oleg conquers the Derevlians.
* 884–885: Prince Oleg defeats the Radimichians and the Severians, bringing them under his rule.
* 907: Prince Oleg launched an incursion against the Greeks, resulting in a favorable treaty for Rus&#x27;. The Greek emperor Leo conceded to provide allowances for Oleg&#x27;s men, award them a right to stay and trade in Constantinople free of tax, and to enter unconditional peace. This event is not mentioned in Byzantine sources.
* 912: After Oleg&#x27;s prophetic death from a snakebite, prince Igor succeeded him as the ruler of Rus&#x27; and was neither “successful in his military campaigns nor popular with people.” According to the &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot;, Oleg died in 922; if Oleg (Helgi) is the same person as HLGW, &quot;king of the Rus&#x27;&quot;, in the &quot;Genizah Letter&quot;, he would still have been alive in the 940s.
* Ca. 945: Prince Igor was murdered in the act of uprising by the Derevlians. His wife Olga assumed the throne following her husband&#x27;s death and brought revenge upon Igor&#x27;s murderers. Some of the Derevlians were burned in their homes, others were buried alive, while the remaining were simply slaughtered. Olga later ruled as a regent for her young son Svyatoslav, who went on to have an extensive military career as an adult, venturing East against the Khazars and the Bulgars.
* 972: Svyatoslav was killed in a Pecheneg ambush while returning from one of his frequent campaigns against the Greeks.
* 973: The reign of Yaropolk began and was complicated by quarrels with his two brothers, Oleg and Vladimir.
* 978–980: Yaropolk proved himself victorious against his brother Oleg but died at the hands of men of his other brother Vladimir. After inheriting the throne, Vladimir initially upheld pagan practices and worshipped Perun.
* 986–988: The conversion of Volodimer: Vladimir was baptized into Orthodoxy, which later became referred to as the &quot;Baptism of Rus&#x27;&quot; because it was followed by a widespread Christianization of Kievan Rus&#x27;. The entire conversion story covers a large chunk of the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;: pages 84–121, or 37 out of a total of 286 pages (12.9%) of the entire text.
* 1015: Following Vladimir&#x27;s death, Svyatopolk inherited the title of the Prince of Kiev and became known as Svyatopolk the Accursed for his violent actions towards his siblings.
* 1019: Svyatopolk was overthrown by his brother Yaroslav the Wise, whose reign brought an end to the unified kingdom of Rus but laid the foundation for the development of the written tradition in the Kievan Rus&#x27;.
* 1054: After Yaroslav&#x27;s death, the kingdom was split into five princedoms with Izyaslav ruling in Kiev, Svyatoslav in Chernigov, Igor in Volodymyr, Vsevolod in Pereiaslav, and Rostislav in Tmutarakan’.
* 1076: Vsevolod held a victory over his four rivals and became the Grand Prince of Kiev.
* 1093: After Vsevolod’s death, Svyatopolk reigned over the Kievan Rus.
* 1113: Rise to power of Vladimir Monomakh, whose religious testament and prayers were appended at the end of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; by monk Sylvester, working from St. Michael’s monastery in 1116.

== Christian elements ==

The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; is vibrant with Christian themes and biblical allusions, which are often said to reflect the text’s monastic authorship. Aleksandr Koptev remarks that the &quot;Chronicle&quot; belongs to the genre of Christian literature. In the introduction, the chronicler explores the biblical origin of the Slavic people, and traces their heritage back to Noah. On numerous occasions throughout the text, the chronicler discusses the pagan Slavs in a condescending manner, saying “for they were but pagans, and therefore ignorant.” Later in the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, one of the most pivotal moments of the narrative is Vladimir the Great&#x27;s conversion to Orthodox Christianity, which ignited extensive Christianization of Kievan Rus&#x27;.

=== Biblical origin ===
The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; traces the history of the Slavic people all the way back to the times of Noah, whose three sons inherited the Earth:

* Shem inherited the eastern region: Persia, Bactria, Syria, Media, Babylon, Cordyna, Assyria, Mesopotamia, Arabia, Elymais, India, Coelesyria, Commagene, Phoenicia.
* Ham inherited the southern region: Egypt, Libya, Numidia, Massyris, Maurentania, Cilicia, Pamphylia, Mysia, Lycaonia, Phrygia, Camalia, Lycia. Caria, Lydia, Moesia, Troas, Aeolia, Bithynia, Sardinia, Crete, Cyprus.
* Japheth gained north-western territories: Armenia, Britain, Illyria, Dalmatia, Ionia, Macedonia, Media, Paphlagonia, Cappadocia, Scythia, and Thessaly.

The Varangians, the Swedes, the Normans, the Rus, and others were named as descendants of Japheth. In the very beginning, humanity was united into a single nation, but after the fall of the Tower of Babel, the Slavic race was derived from the line of Japheth, “since they are the Noricians, who are identified with the Slavs.”

=== Korsun legend ===

According to the so-called &quot;Korsun legend&quot;, presented in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; just preceding the conversion of Volodimer, the Prince took possession of the Greek city of Korsun (Chersonesus) in the Crimean Peninsula, in an attempt to gain certain benefits from Emperor Basil. Following Vladimir&#x27;s successful conquest of the city, he demanded that the Emperor&#x27;s &#x27;unwedded&#x27; sister be given up for marriage with him. Upon hearing the news from Korsun, emperor Basil responded that &quot;It is not meet for Christians to be given in marriage to pagans. If you are baptized, you shall have her to wife, inherit the kingdom of God, and be our companion in faith.&quot; The legend concludes with Vladimir&#x27;s embrace of Christianity at the church of St. Basil in Korsun and his marriage to the Emperor&#x27;s sister, Anna Porphyrogenita.

=== Archaeological findings ===
For centuries after the &quot;Chronicle’s&quot; creation, the legend&#x27;s factuality was subject to extensive debate. Many historians, antiquarians, and archaeologists had attempted to determine the actual location of Vladimir&#x27;s conversion by synthesizing textual evidence of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; with material evidence from Crimea. Their efforts became known in the realms of historical discipline as the “archaeology of the Korsun legend.” This search culminated under Archbishop Innokentii&#x27;s diocesan administration (1848–57), when in the ruins of Chersonesos, archaeologists unearthed the foundations of three churches and determined that the one containing the richest findings was allegedly used for the baptism of the Kievan Prince. The unearthed material evidence proved sufficient to pinpoint the real location of the legend&#x27;s events with reasonable accuracy. 

In the early 1860s, the Eastern Orthodox Church began construction of The Saint Vladimir Cathedral in Chersonesos, which has been destroyed on three separate occasions after first being erected and was renovated each time thereafter. The cathedral last faced destruction during the October Revolution and was not restored until the fall of the Soviet Union. It has been argued that by honoring Vladimir the Great and his contribution to the Eastern Orthodoxy, the cathedral serves the purpose of validating Russia&#x27;s historical ties with the Crimean Peninsula, the accounts of which are preserved by the &quot;Chronicle&quot;.

==Assessment and critique==

Unlike many other medieval chronicles written by European monks, the &quot;Tale of Bygone Years&quot; is unique as the only written testimony on the earliest history of East Slavic people. Its comprehensive account of the history of Rus&#x27; is unmatched in other sources, but important correctives are provided by the &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot;. It is also valuable as a prime example of the Old East Slavonic literature.

However, its reliability has been widely called into question and placed under careful examination by contemporary specialists in the field of the Old East Slavonic history. The first doubts about trustworthiness of the narratives were voiced by Nikolay Karamzin in his &quot;History of the Russian State&quot; (1816–26), which brought attention to Nestor&#x27;s questionable chronology and style of prose. Building upon Karamzin&#x27;s observations, further inquiries into the philology of the &quot;Rus Primary Chronicle&quot; shined more light on various weaknesses in the text&#x27;s composition. According to Dmitry Likhachov (1950), the chronicle exhibits the presence of plentiful &quot;fillers&quot; that were added &quot;post factum&quot; and, in effect, &quot;destroyed the narrative&#x27;s logical progression.&quot;

According to Aleksey Shakhmatov (1916), some of the incongruities are a direct result of the fact that &quot;the ruling Princes of Kiev had their own propagandists who rewrote the annals to make political claims that best suited their own purposes.&quot; Shakhmatov further described the &quot;Tale of Bygone Years&quot; as a literary creation that fell under heavy influence of the Church and the State. 
Dmitry Likhachov famously wrote in his 1950 critique of the &quot;Rus Primary Chronicle&quot;, &quot;No other country in the world is cloaked in such contradictory myths about its history as Russia, and no other nation in the world interprets its history as variously as do the Russian people.&quot; The need to interpret the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, mentioned by Likhachov as essential to making sense of its narrative, stems from the facts that the text was initially compiled and edited by multiple authors with different agendas and that it had to be translated from Old East Slavic language, which proved to be an arduous task.

Harvard linguist Horace G. Lunt (1988) found it important to &quot;admit freely that we are speculating&quot; when tales – such as Yaroslav the Wise being more than just &quot;a patron of Slavonic books&quot; – are reconstructed and the logical incongruities of the text are faced. 

Polish historian Wladyslaw Duczko (2004) concluded that the compiler of the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; &#x27;manipulated his sources in the usual way: information that was not compatible was left aside, while the elements that should be there but did not exist, were invented.&#x27; Russian historian and author Igor Danilevsky mentioned that the &quot;Rus Primary Chronicle&quot; was more concerned with exploring the religious significance of the events rather than conveying to the reader the information about how it actually happened. As a result, a sizable portion of the text was directly borrowed from earlier works that contained a religious undertone like some Byzantine sources, and most notably, the Bible. The protagonists are frequently identified with biblical personages and so are ascribed certain relevant qualities and deeds that did not necessarily match the reality.

Ukrainian historian Oleksiy Tolochko in 2015 upheld the conclusion reached by his many predecessors that the &quot;Chronicle’s&quot; contents are more or less fictional. Tolochko argued that some of the tales, like the story of the Rurikid clan&#x27;s entry into Kiev, were invented &quot;so as to produce a meaningful reconstruction of past events and include these well-known names&quot; in the author&#x27;s &quot;historical scenario.&quot; Tolochko called the &quot;Rus Primary Chronicle&quot; an outstanding work of literature with an untrustworthy story and concluded that &quot;there is absolutely no reason to continue basing our knowledge of the past on its content.&quot;

Paul Bushkovitch (2012) from Yale University writes “the author was serving his rulers, identifying princes and people and leaving historians with a muddle virtually impossible to sort out.” He also mentions that there are discrepancies when overlapping Scandinavian history with the narrative of the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;. For example, “archeological evidence does not fit the legends of the &quot;Primary Chronicle”&quot; such as: “in Scandinavia itself, there were no sagas of Viking triumphs and wars in Russia to match those recounting the conquest of Iceland and the British Isles”. The credibility of the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; should be taken with a grain of salt for its undertone of being a political tool to justify rule.

== Translations ==
August Ludwig von Schlözer produced a German translation with commentary of the &quot;Povest&#x27; vremennykh let&quot; through 980 in five volumes (&quot;Hecтopъ. Russische Annalen in ihrer Slavonischen Grund–Sprache&quot;. Göttingen, 1802–1809).

In 1930, Harvard professor Samuel Hazzard Cross published an English translation of the Laurentian Codex&#x27;s version of the PVL under the title &quot;The Russian Primary Chronicle. Laurentian Text.&quot;, which became very influential amongst American readers. Cross was working on a revised edition when he died; it was completed and published by Georgetown University professor Olgerd P. Sherbowitz-Wetzor in 1953. By the early 21st century, &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; had become the common shortened English name for the text shared by the surviving five main manuscripts of the PVL. Nevertheless, Cross&#x27; translation was often found inaccurate, with Waugh (1974) writing that Perfecky (1973) had produced a more reliable English translation of the &quot;Galician–Volhynian Chronicle&quot; than how Cross translated the PVL.

The 2001 German translation by Ludolf Müller has been called &#x27;without doubt the best available rendering of the PVL into a modern language&#x27;. The 2015 Dutch translation by Hans Thuis (begun with Victoria van Aalst since 2000) was based on the main six textual witnesses, scholarly publications by Müller, Likhachev and Ostrowski, and by comparison to the German translation of Trautmann (1931), the English translation of Cross &amp; Sherbowitz-Wetzor (1930, 1953), the Russian translation of Likhachev (1950), and the German translation of Müller (2001).

<doc id="45678" wikidata="Q211745" url="?curid=45678" title="Atonality">
<text>Atonality in its broadest sense is music that lacks a tonal center, or key. &quot;Atonality&quot;, in this sense, usually describes compositions written from about the early 20th-century to the present day, where a hierarchy of harmonies focusing on a single, central triad is not used, and the notes of the chromatic scale function independently of one another. More narrowly, the term &quot;atonality&quot; describes music that does not conform to the system of tonal hierarchies that characterized European classical music between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. &quot;The repertory of atonal music is characterized by the occurrence of pitches in novel combinations, as well as by the occurrence of familiar pitch combinations in unfamiliar environments&quot;.

The term is also occasionally used to describe music that is neither tonal nor serial, especially the pre-twelve-tone music of the Second Viennese School, principally Alban Berg, Arnold Schoenberg, and Anton Webern. However, &quot;as a categorical label, &#x27;atonal&#x27; generally means only that the piece is in the Western tradition and is not &#x27;tonal, although there are longer periods, e.g., medieval, renaissance, and modern modal music to which this definition does not apply. &quot;Serialism arose partly as a means of organizing more coherently the relations used in the pre-serial &#x27;free atonal&#x27; music. ... Thus, many useful and crucial insights about even strictly serial music depend only on such basic atonal theory&quot;.

Late 19th- and early 20th-century composers such as Alexander Scriabin, Claude Debussy, Paul Hindemith, Béla Bartók, Sergei Prokofiev, Igor Stravinsky, and Edgard Varèse, have written music that has been described, in full or in part, as atonal.

== History ==
While music without a tonal center had been previously written, for example Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Bagatelle sans tonalité&quot; of 1885, it is with the coming of the twentieth century that the term &quot;atonality&quot; began to be applied to pieces, particularly those written by Arnold Schoenberg and The Second Viennese School. The term &quot;atonality&quot; was coined in 1907 by Joseph Marx in a scholarly study of tonality, which was later expanded into his doctoral thesis.

Their music arose from what was described as the &quot;crisis of tonality&quot; between the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century in classical music. This situation had arisen over the course of the nineteenth century due to the increasing use of ambiguous chords, improbable harmonic inflections, and more unusual melodic and rhythmic inflections than what was possible within the styles of tonal music. The distinction between the exceptional and the normal became more and more blurred. As a result, there was a &quot;concomitant loosening&quot; of the synthetic bonds through which tones and harmonies had been related to one another. The connections between harmonies were uncertain even on the lowest chord-to-chord level. On higher levels, long-range harmonic relationships and implications became so tenuous, that they hardly functioned at all. At best, the felt probabilities of the style system had become obscure. At worst, they were approaching a uniformity, which provided few guides for either composition or listening. 
The first phase, known as &quot;free atonality&quot; or &quot;free chromaticism&quot;, involved a conscious attempt to avoid traditional diatonic harmony. Works of this period include the opera &quot;Wozzeck&quot; (1917–1922) by Alban Berg and &quot;Pierrot lunaire&quot; (1912) by Schoenberg.

The second phase, begun after World War I, was exemplified by attempts to create a systematic means of composing without tonality, most famously the method of composing with 12 tones or the twelve-tone technique. This period included Berg&#x27;s &quot;Lulu&quot; and &quot;Lyric Suite&quot;, Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Piano Concerto&quot;, his oratorio &quot;Die Jakobsleiter&quot; and numerous smaller pieces, as well as his last two string quartets. Schoenberg was the major innovator of the system. His student, Anton Webern, however, is anecdotally claimed to have begun linking dynamics and tone color to the primary row, making rows not only of pitches but of other aspects of music as well. However, actual analysis of Webern&#x27;s twelve-tone works has so far failed to demonstrate the truth of this assertion. One analyst concluded, following a minute examination of the Piano Variations, op. 27, that while the texture of this music may superficially resemble that of some serial music ... its structure does not. None of the patterns within separate nonpitch characteristics makes audible (or even numerical) sense &quot;in itself&quot;. The point is that these characteristics are still playing their traditional role of differentiation. Twelve-tone technique, combined with the parametrization (separate organization of four aspects of music: pitch, attack character, intensity, and duration) of Olivier Messiaen, would be taken as the inspiration for serialism.

Atonality emerged as a pejorative term to condemn music in which chords were organized seemingly with no apparent coherence. In Nazi Germany, atonal music was attacked as &quot;Bolshevik&quot; and labeled as degenerate (&quot;Entartete Musik&quot;) along with other music produced by enemies of the Nazi regime. Many composers had their works banned by the regime, not to be played until after its collapse at the end of World War II.

After Schoenberg&#x27;s death, Igor Stravinsky used the twelve-tone technique. Iannis Xenakis generated pitch sets from mathematical formulae, and also saw the expansion of tonal possibilities as part of a synthesis between the hierarchical principle and the theory of numbers, principles which have dominated music since at least the time of Parmenides.

===Free atonality===
The twelve-tone technique was preceded by Schoenberg&#x27;s freely atonal pieces of 1908 to 1923, which, though free, often have as an &quot;integrative element...a minute intervallic cell&quot; that in addition to expansion may be transformed as with a tone row, and in which individual notes may &quot;function as pivotal elements, to permit overlapping statements of a basic cell or the linking of two or more basic cells&quot;. The decay of the sense of tonality and the subsequent distribution into individual elements brought three concepts into play: 1. Musical elements that had since been secondary to tonal form groups now became autonomous. 2. The absence of tonal coherence prompted the search for a unity that could connect the disjointed musical language in an alternative way. 3. Due to the replacement of diatonic principles, new concepts of form arose.

The twelve-tone technique was also preceded by nondodecaphonic serial composition used independently in the works of Alexander Scriabin, Igor Stravinsky, Béla Bartók, Carl Ruggles, and others. &quot;Essentially, Schoenberg and Hauer systematized and defined for their own dodecaphonic purposes a pervasive technical feature of &#x27;modern&#x27; musical practice, the ostinato.&quot;

==Composing atonal music==
Setting out to compose atonal music may seem complicated because of both the vagueness and generality of the term. Additionally George Perle explains that, &quot;the &#x27;free&#x27; atonality that preceded dodecaphony precludes by definition the possibility of self-consistent, generally applicable compositional procedures&quot;. However, he provides one example as a way to compose atonal pieces, a pre-twelve-tone technique piece by Anton Webern, which rigorously avoids anything that suggests tonality, to choose pitches that do not imply tonality. In other words, reverse the rules of the common practice period so that what was not allowed is required and what was required is not allowed. This is what was done by Charles Seeger in his explanation of dissonant counterpoint, which is a way to write atonal counterpoint.

Kostka and Payne list four procedures as operational in the atonal music of Schoenberg, all of which may be taken as negative rules. Avoidance of melodic or harmonic octaves, avoidance of traditional pitch collections such as major or minor triads, avoidance of more than three successive pitches from the same diatonic scale, and use of disjunct melodies (avoidance of conjunct melodies).

Further, Perle agrees with Oster and Katz that, &quot;the abandonment of the concept of a root-generator of the individual chord is a radical development that renders futile any attempt at a systematic formulation of chord structure and progression in atonal music along the lines of traditional harmonic theory&quot;. Atonal compositional techniques and results &quot;are not reducible to a set of foundational assumptions in terms of which the compositions that are collectively designated by the expression &#x27;atonal music&#x27; can be said to represent &#x27;a system&#x27; of composition&quot;. Equal-interval chords are often of indeterminate root, mixed-interval chords are often best characterized by their interval content, while both lend themselves to atonal contexts.

Perle also points out that structural coherence is most often achieved through operations on intervallic cells. A cell &quot;may operate as a kind of microcosmic set of fixed intervallic content, statable either as a chord or as a melodic figure or as a combination of both. Its components may be fixed with regard to order, in which event it may be employed, like the twelve-tone set, in its literal transformations. … Individual tones may function as pivotal elements, to permit overlapping statements of a basic cell or the linking of two or more basic cells&quot;.

Regarding the post-tonal music of Perle, one theorist wrote: &quot;While ... montages of discrete-seeming elements tend to accumulate global rhythms other than those of tonal progressions and their rhythms, there is a similarity between the two sorts of accumulates spatial and temporal relationships: a similarity consisting of generalized arching tone-centers linked together by shared background referential materials&quot;.

Another approach of composition techniques for atonal music is given by Allen Forte who developed the theory behind atonal music. Forte describes two main operations: transposition and inversion. Transposition can be seen as a rotation of &quot;t&quot; either clockwise or anti-clockwise on a circle, where each note of the chord is rotated equally. For example, if &quot;t&quot; = 2 and the chord is [0 3 6], transposition (clockwise) will be [2 5 8]. Inversion can be seen as a symmetry with respect to the axis formed by 0 and 6. If we carry on with our example [0 3 6] becomes [0 9 6].

An important characteristic are the invariants, which are the notes which stay identical after a transformation. No difference is made between the octave in which the note is played so that, for example, all Cs are equivalent, no matter the octave in which they actually occur. This is why the 12-note scale is represented by a circle. This leads us to the definition of the similarity between two chords which considers the subsets and the interval content of each chord.

== Reception and legacy ==

=== Controversy over the term itself ===
The term &quot;atonality&quot; itself has been controversial. Arnold Schoenberg, whose music is generally used to define the term, was vehemently opposed to it, arguing that &quot;The word &#x27;atonal&#x27; could only signify something entirely inconsistent with the nature of tone... to call any relation of tones atonal is just as farfetched as it would be to designate a relation of colors aspectral or acomplementary. There is no such antithesis&quot;.

Composer and theorist Milton Babbitt also disparaged the term, saying &quot;The works that followed, many of them now familiar, include the &quot;Five Pieces for Orchestra&quot;, &quot;Erwartung&quot;, &quot;Pierrot Lunaire&quot;, and they and a few yet to follow soon were termed &#x27;atonal,&#x27; by I know not whom, and I prefer not to know, for in no sense does the term make sense. Not only does the music employ &#x27;tones,&#x27; but it employs precisely the same &#x27;tones,&#x27; the same physical materials, that music had employed for some two centuries. In all generosity, &#x27;atonal&#x27; may have been intended as a mildly analytically derived term to suggest &#x27;atonic&#x27; or to signify &#x27;a-triadic tonality&#x27;, but, even so there were infinitely many things the music was not&quot;.

&quot;Atonal&quot; developed a certain vagueness in meaning as a result of its use to describe a wide variety of compositional approaches that deviated from traditional chords and chord progressions. Attempts to solve these problems by using terms such as &quot;pan-tonal&quot;, &quot;non-tonal&quot;, &quot;multi-tonal&quot;, &quot;free-tonal&quot; and &quot;without tonal center&quot; instead of &quot;atonal&quot; have not gained broad acceptance.

=== Criticism of the concept of atonality ===
Composer Anton Webern held that &quot;new laws asserted themselves that made it impossible to designate a piece as being in one key or another&quot;. Composer Walter Piston, on the other hand, said that, out of long habit, whenever performers &quot;play any little phrase they will hear it in some key—it may not be the right one, but the point is they will play it with a tonal sense. ... [T]he more I feel I know Schoenberg&#x27;s music the more I believe he thought that way himself. ... And it isn&#x27;t only the players; it&#x27;s also the listeners. They will hear tonality in everything&quot;.

Donald Jay Grout similarly doubted whether atonality is really possible, because &quot;any combination of sounds can be referred to a fundamental root&quot;. He defined it as a fundamentally subjective category: &quot;atonal music is music in which the person who is using the word cannot hear tonal centers&quot;.

One difficulty is that even an otherwise &quot;atonal&quot; work, tonality &quot;by assertion&quot; is normally heard on the thematic or linear level. That is, centricity may be established through the repetition of a central pitch or from emphasis by means of instrumentation, register, rhythmic elongation, or metric accent.

=== Criticism of atonal music ===
Swiss conductor, composer, and musical philosopher Ernest Ansermet, a critic of atonal music, wrote extensively on this in the book &quot;Les fondements de la musique dans la conscience humaine&quot; (The Foundations of Music in Human Consciousness), where he argued that the classical musical language was a precondition for musical expression with its clear, harmonious structures. Ansermet argued that a tone system can only lead to a uniform perception of music if it is deduced from just a single interval. For Ansermet this interval is the fifth.

In France, on December 20, 2012, French pianist Jérôme Ducros gave a conference at the Collège de France entitled &quot;Atonalism. And after?&quot; as part of Karol Beffa&#x27;s chair of artistic creation. He compares the discursive properties of tonal language and non-tonal languages, largely giving the advantage to the former, and considers the return of tonality as inevitable. This conference sparked a heated controversy in the French musical world.

== Examples ==
An example of atonal music would be Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Pierrot Lunaire&quot;, which is a song cycle composed in 1912. The work uses a technique called &quot;Sprechstimme&quot; or spoken singing, and the music is atonal, meaning that there is no clear tonal center or key. Instead, the notes of the chromatic scale function independently of each other, and the harmonies do not follow the traditional tonal hierarchy found in classical music. The result is a dissonant and jarring sound that is quite different from the harmonies found in tonal music.

<doc id="45705" wikidata="Q1377019" url="?curid=45705" title="Inverse transform sampling">
<text>Inverse transform sampling (also known as inversion sampling, the inverse probability integral transform, the inverse transformation method, or the [[Nikolai Smirnov (mathematician)|Smirnov]] transform) is a basic method for pseudo-random number sampling, i.e., for generating sample numbers at random from any probability distribution given its cumulative distribution function.

Inverse transformation sampling takes uniform samples of a number formula_1 between 0 and 1, interpreted as a probability, and then returns the smallest number formula_2 such that formula_3 for the cumulative distribution function formula_4 of a random variable. For example, imagine that formula_4 is the standard normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation one. The table below shows samples taken from the uniform distribution and their representation on the standard normal distribution.

We are randomly choosing a proportion of the area under the curve and returning the number in the domain such that exactly this proportion of the area occurs to the left of that number. Intuitively, we are unlikely to choose a number in the far end of tails because there is very little area in them which would require choosing a number very close to zero or one.

Computationally, this method involves computing the quantile function of the distribution — in other words, computing the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the distribution (which maps a number in the domain to a probability between 0 and 1) and then inverting that function. This is the source of the term &quot;inverse&quot; or &quot;inversion&quot; in most of the names for this method. Note that for a discrete distribution, computing the CDF is not in general too difficult: we simply add up the individual probabilities for the various points of the distribution. For a continuous distribution, however, we need to integrate the probability density function (PDF) of the distribution, which is impossible to do analytically for most distributions (including the normal distribution). As a result, this method may be computationally inefficient for many distributions and other methods are preferred; however, it is a useful method for building more generally applicable samplers such as those based on rejection sampling.

For the normal distribution, the lack of an analytical expression for the corresponding quantile function means that other methods (e.g. the Box–Muller transform) may be preferred computationally. It is often the case that, even for simple distributions, the inverse transform sampling method can be improved on: see, for example, the ziggurat algorithm and rejection sampling. On the other hand, it is possible to approximate the quantile function of the normal distribution extremely accurately using moderate-degree polynomials, and in fact the method of doing this is fast enough that inversion sampling is now the default method for sampling from a normal distribution in the statistical package R.

==Formal statement==

For any random variable formula_6, the random variable formula_7 has the same distribution as formula_8, where formula_9 is the generalized inverse of the cumulative distribution function formula_10 of formula_8 and formula_12 is uniform on formula_13.

For continuous random variables, the inverse probability integral transform is indeed the inverse of the probability integral transform, which states that for a continuous random variable formula_8 with cumulative distribution function formula_10, the random variable formula_16 is uniform on formula_13.

== Intuition ==
From formula_18, we want to generate formula_8 with CDF formula_20 We assume formula_21 to be a continuous, strictly increasing function, which provides good intuition.

We want to see if we can find some strictly monotone transformation formula_22, such that formula_23. We will have

formula_24

where the last step used that formula_25 when formula_12 is uniform on formula_13.

So we got formula_10 to be the inverse function of formula_29, or, equivalently formula_30

Therefore, we can generate formula_31 from formula_32

==The method==
The problem that the inverse transform sampling method solves is as follows:

*Let formula_8 be a random variable whose distribution can be described by the cumulative distribution function formula_10.
*We want to generate values of formula_8 which are distributed according to this distribution.

The inverse transform sampling method works as follows:
#Generate a random number formula_1 from the standard uniform distribution in the interval formula_13, i.e. from formula_38
#Find the generalized inverse of the desired CDF, i.e. formula_39.
# Compute formula_40. The computed random variable formula_41 has distribution formula_10 and thereby the same law as formula_8.

Expressed differently, given a cumulative distribution function formula_10 and a uniform variable formula_45, the random variable formula_46 has the distribution formula_10.

In the continuous case, a treatment of such inverse functions as objects satisfying differential equations can be given. Some such differential equations admit explicit power series solutions, despite their non-linearity.

== Examples ==
* As an example, suppose we have a random variable formula_48 and a cumulative distribution function
: formula_49
: In order to perform an inversion we want to solve for formula_50
: formula_51
: From here we would perform steps one, two and three.

* As another example, we use the exponential distribution with formula_52 for x ≥ 0 (and 0 otherwise). By solving y=F(x) we obtain the inverse function
: formula_53
:It means that if we draw some formula_54from a formula_48 and compute formula_56 This formula_57 has exponential distribution.
: The idea is illustrated in the following graph:
: Note that the distribution does not change if we start with 1-y instead of y. For computational purposes, it therefore suffices to generate random numbers y in [0, 1] and then simply calculate
: formula_58

==Proof of correctness==
Let formula_4 be a cumulative distribution function, and let formula_60 be its generalized inverse function (using the infimum because CDFs are weakly monotonic and right-continuous):

:&lt;math&gt;F^{-1}(u) = \inf\;\{x \mid F(x)\geq u\} \qquad (0

&quot;Claim:&quot; If formula_12 is a uniform random variable on formula_13 then formula_63 has formula_4 as its CDF.

&quot;Proof:&quot;

:formula_65

== Truncated distribution ==

Inverse transform sampling can be simply extended to cases of truncated distributions on the interval formula_66 without the cost of rejection sampling: the same algorithm can be followed, but instead of generating a random number formula_1 uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, generate formula_1 uniformly distributed between formula_69 and formula_70, and then again take formula_71.

== Reduction of the number of inversions ==
In order to obtain a large number of samples, one needs to perform the same number of inversions of the distribution. 
One possible way to reduce the number of inversions while obtaining a large number of samples is the application of the so-called Stochastic Collocation Monte Carlo sampler (SCMC sampler) within a polynomial chaos expansion framework. This allows us to generate any number of Monte Carlo samples with only a few inversions of the original distribution with independent samples of a variable for which the inversions are analytically available, for example the standard normal variable.

== Software implementations ==
There are software implementations available for applying the inverse sampling method by using numerical approximations of the inverse in the case that it is not available in closed form. For example, an approximation of the inverse can be computed if the user provides some information about the distributions such as the PDF or the CDF.

* C library UNU.RAN 
* R library Runuran 
* Python subpackage sampling in scipy.stats

* Copula, defined by means of probability integral transform.

* Inverse distribution function for a precise mathematical definition for distributions with discrete components.
* Rejection sampling is another common technique to generate random variates that does not rely on inversion of the CDF.

<text>The  (; , Tiberian: &quot;Năḇīʾīm&quot; &#x27;Prophets&#x27;, ) is the second major division of the Hebrew Bible (the &quot;Tanakh&quot;), lying between the () and (). The Nevi&#x27;im are divided into two groups. The Former Prophets ( ) consists of the narrative books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings; while the Latter Prophets ( ) include the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Twelve Minor Prophets.

== Synopsis ==
The Jewish tradition counts eight books in &quot;Nevi&#x27;im&quot; out of twenty-four books in the Hebrew Bible. There are four books of the Former Prophets, including Joshua and Judges, and the collected &quot;Books of Samuel&quot; and &quot;Books of Kings&quot; are each counted as one book. Among the four books of the Latter Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel account for three books, followed by the &quot;Twelve&quot; (: Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi), which is counted as a single book.

The development of the Hebrew Bible canon placed the Book of Daniel as part of the &quot;Writings,&quot; or &quot;Ketuvim&quot;, rather than &quot;Nevi&#x27;im&quot;, in distinction to the later approach of the various Christian Bibles for Protestants, Roman Catholics, and Eastern Orthodox, in which Daniel is found among the Prophets, due to its prophetic nature according to common Christian theology.
In the Jewish liturgy, a series of selections from the Nevi&#x27;im is publicly read or sung aloud inside the synagogue as part of Jewish religious practice. The haftara follows the Torah reading on Shabbat and on Jewish holidays and fast days. The haftara readings do not contain the whole text of the Nevi‘im; they are selections.

===Former Prophets===

The Former Prophets are the books Joshua, Judges, 1st &amp; 2nd Samuel, and 1st &amp; 2nd Kings. They contain historical narratives that begin immediately after the death of Moses with the divine appointment of Joshua as his successor, who then leads the people of Israel into the Promised Land, and end with the release from imprisonment of the last king of Judah. Treating Samuel and Kings as single books, they cover:
# Joshua&#x27;s conquest of the land of Canaan (in the Book of Joshua), 
# the struggle of the people to possess the land (in the Book of Judges), 
# the people&#x27;s request to God to give them a king so that they can occupy the land in the face of their enemies (in the books of 1st and 2nd Samuel)
# the possession of the land under the divinely-appointed kings of the House of David, ending in conquest and foreign exile (1st and 2nd Kings)
The reference to the &quot;former prophets&quot; or &quot;earlier prophets&quot; in Zechariah 1:4 probably includes &quot;the whole body of prophets&quot; prior to the post-exilic period when Haggai and Zechariah were active.

====Joshua====
The Book of Joshua (&quot;Yehoshua&quot; יהושע) contains a history of the Israelites from the death of Moses to that of Joshua. After Moses&#x27; death, Joshua, by virtue of his previous appointment as Moses&#x27; successor, receives from God the command to cross the Jordan. In execution of this order Joshua issues the requisite instructions to the stewards of the people for the crossing of the Jordan; and he reminds the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half of Manasseh of their pledge given to Moses to help their brethren. He also performs miracles, or magic, such as stopping the sun and moon, and stopping the Jordan river.

The book essentially consists of three parts:
# The history of the conquest of the land (1–12).
# The allotment of the land to the different tribes, with the appointment of cities of refuge, the provision for the Levites (13–22), and the dismissal of the eastern tribes to their homes.
# The farewell addresses of Joshua, with an account of his death (23, 24).

====Judges====
The Book of Judges (&quot;Shoftim&quot; שופטים) consists of three distinct parts:
#The Introduction (1:1–3:10 and 3:12) giving a summary of the book of Joshua.
#The Main Text (3:11–16:31), discussing the five Great Judges, Abimelech, and providing glosses for a few minor Judges.
#The Appendices (17:1–21:25), giving two stories set in the time of the Judges, but not discussing the Judges themselves.

====Samuel====
The Books of Samuel (&quot;Shmu&#x27;el&quot; שמואל) consists of five parts:
* The period of God&#x27;s rejection of Eli, Samuel&#x27;s birth, and subsequent judgment (1 Samuel 1:1–7:17).
* The period of the life of Saul prior to meeting David (1 Samuel 8:1–15:35).
* The period of Saul&#x27;s interaction with David (1 Samuel 16:1 – 2 Samuel 1:27).
* The period of David&#x27;s reign and the rebellions he suffers (2 Samuel 2:1–20:22).
* An appendix of material concerning David in no particular order, and out of sequence with the rest of the text (2 Samuel 22:1–24:25).

A conclusion of sorts appears at 1 Kings 1–2, concerning Solomon enacting a final revenge on those who did what David perceived as wrongdoing, and having a similar narrative style. While the subject matter in the Book(s) of Samuel is also covered by the narrative in Chronicles, it is noticeable that the section (2 Sam. 11:2–12:29) containing an account of the matter of Bathsheba is omitted in the corresponding passage in 1 Chr. 20.

====Kings====
The Books of Kings (&quot;Melakhim&quot; ) contain accounts of the kings of the ancient Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah, and the annals of the Jewish commonwealth from the accession of Solomon until the subjugation of the kingdom by Nebuchadnezzar II and the Neo-Babylonian Empire.

===Latter Prophets===
The Latter Prophets are divided into two groups: the major prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel) and the Twelve Minor Prophets (Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi) collected into a single book. Again, although Daniel is considered a major prophet, his book is not in the category of the Nevi&#x27;im.

====Isaiah====
The 66 chapters of the Book of Isaiah consist primarily of prophecies of the judgments awaiting nations that are persecuting Judah. These nations include Babylon, Neo-Assyrian Empire, Philistia, Moab, Syria, The Northern Kingdom of Israel, Ethiopia, Egypt, Arabia, and Phoenicia. The prophecies concerning them can be summarized as saying that God is the God of the whole earth and that nations which think of themselves as secure in their power might well be conquered by other nations, at God&#x27;s command.

Chapter 6 describes Isaiah&#x27;s call to be a prophet of God. Chapters 36–39 provide historical material about King Hezekiah and his triumph of faith in God. Chapters 24–35, while too complex to characterize in brief, are primarily concerned with prophecies of a Messiah, a person anointed or given power by God, and of the Messiah&#x27;s kingdom, where justice and righteousness will reign. Jews see this section as describing an actual king, a descendant of their great king, David, who will make Judah a great kingdom and Jerusalem a genuinely holy city.

The prophecy continues with what some scholars have called &quot;The Book of Comfort&quot;, which begins in chapter 40 and completes the writing. In the first eight chapters of this book of comfort, Isaiah prophesies the deliverance of the Jews from the hands of the Babylonians and the restoration of Israel as a unified nation in the land God promised them. Isaiah reaffirms that the Jews are indeed the chosen people of God in chapter 44 and that Yahweh is the only God for the Jews, as he will show his power over the gods of Babylon in due time in chapter 46. In chapter 45:1, the Persian ruler Cyrus the Great is named as the Messiah who will overthrow the Neo-Babylonian Empire and allow the return of Israel to their original land. The remaining chapters of the book contain prophecies of the future glory of Zion under the rule of a righteous servant (52 and 54). Chapter 53 includes a very poetic prophecy about this servant, which is generally considered by Christians to refer to the crucifixion of Jesus. However, Jews typically interpret it as a reference to God&#x27;s people. Although there is still the mention of judgment of false worshippers and idolaters (65 and 66), the book ends with a message of hope of a righteous ruler who extends salvation to his righteous subjects living in the Lord&#x27;s kingdom on earth.

====Jeremiah====
The Book of Jeremiah can be divided into twenty-three chapters, which are organized into five sub-sections or books:
# The introduction, ch. 1.
# Scorn for the sins of Israel, consisting of seven sections, (1.) ch. 2; (2.) ch. 3–6; (3.) ch. 7–10; (4.) ch. 11–13; (5.) ch. 14–17:18; (6.) ch. 17:19–ch. 20; (7.) ch. 21–24.
# A general review of all nations, foreseeing their destruction, in two sections, (1.) ch. 46–49; (2.) ch. 25; with a historical appendix of three sections, (1.) ch. 26; (2.) ch. 27; (3.) ch. 28, 29.
# Two sections picturing the hopes of better times, (1.) ch. 30, 31; (2.) ch. 32,33; a historical appendix in three sections is added, (1.) ch. 34:1–7; (2.) ch. 34:8-22; (3.) ch. 35.
# The conclusion, in two sections, (1.) ch. 36; (2.) ch. 45.

In Egypt, after an interval, Jeremiah is supposed to have added three sections, viz., ch. 37–39; 40–43; and 44. The main Messianic prophecies are in 23:1–8; 31:31–40; and 33:14–26.

Jeremiah&#x27;s prophecies are noted for the frequent repetitions of the exact words, phrases, and imagery found in them. They cover about 30 years. They are not in chronological order. Modern scholars do not believe they have reliable theories about when, where, and how the text was edited into its present form.

====Ezekiel====
The Book of Ezekiel contains three distinct sections:
# Judgment on Israel – Ezekiel makes a series of denunciations against his fellow Judeans (3:22–24), warning them of the certain destruction of Jerusalem, in opposition to the words of the false prophets (4:1–3). The symbolic acts, by which the extremities to which Jerusalem would be reduced are described in Chapters 4 and 5, show his intimate acquaintance with the Levitical legislation. (See, for example, Exodus 22:30; Deuteronomy 14:21; Leviticus 5:2; 7:18,24; 17:15; 19:7; 22:8)
# Prophecies against various neighboring nations: against the Ammonites ( Ezek. 25:1–7), the Moabites ( 25:8–11), the Edomites (25:12–14), the Philistines (25:15–17), Tyre and Sidon (26–28), and against Egypt (29-32).
# Prophecies delivered after the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar II: the triumphs of Israel and of the kingdom of God on earth (Ezek. 33–39); Messianic times, and the establishment and prosperity of the kingdom of God (40–48).

====The Twelve====

The Twelve are:
# Hosea or &quot;Hoshea&quot; [הושע]
# Joel or &quot;Yo&#x27;el&quot; [יואל]
# Amos [עמוס]
# Obadiah or &quot;Ovadyah&quot; [עובדיה]
# Jonah or &quot;Yonah&quot; [יונה]
# Micah or &quot;Mikhah&quot; [מיכה]
# Nahum or &quot;Nachum&quot; [נחום]
# Habakkuk or &quot;Habaquq&quot; [חבקוק]
# Zephaniah or &quot;Tsefania&quot; [צפניה]
# Haggai or &quot;Haggai&quot; [חגי]
# Zechariah &quot;Zekharia&quot; [זכריה]
# Malachi or &quot;Malakhi&quot; [מלאכי]

==Liturgical use==

The Haftarah is a text selected from the books of &quot;Nevi&#x27;im&quot; that is read publicly in the synagogue after the reading of the Torah on each Shabbat, as well as on Jewish festivals and fast days.

===Cantillation===
There is a special cantillation melody for the haftarah, distinct from that of the Torah portion. In some earlier authorities there are references to a tune for the &quot;prophets&quot; generally, distinct from that for the haftarah: this may have been a simplified melody for learning purposes.

Certain cantillation marks and combinations appear in Nevi&#x27;im but not within any of the Haftarah selections, and most communities therefore do not have a musical tradition for those marks. J.L. Neeman suggested that &quot;those who recite Nevi&#x27;im privately with the cantillation melody may read the words accented by those rare notes by using a &quot;metaphor&quot; based on the melody of those notes in the five books of the Torah, while adhering to the musical scale of the melody for Nevi&#x27;im.&quot; Neeman includes a reconstruction of the musical scale for the lost melodies of the rare cantillation notes. In the Ashkenazi tradition, the resemblance between the Torah and Haftarah melodies is obvious and it is easy to transpose motifs between the two as suggested by Neeman. In the Sephardi traditions the haftarah melody is considerably more florid than the Torah melody, and usually in a different musical mode, and there are only isolated points of contact between the two.

===Extraliturgical public reading===

In some Near and Middle Eastern Jewish traditions, the whole of Nevi&#x27;im (as well as the rest of the Tanakh and the Mishnah) is read each year on a weekly rota, usually on Shabbat afternoons. These reading sessions often take place in the synagogue courtyard but are not considered to be synagogue services.

==Aramaic translation==
A &quot;targum&quot; is an Aramaic translation of the Hebrew Scriptures that was compiled or written in the Land of Israel or in Babylonia from the Second Temple period until the early Middle Ages (late first millennium). According to the Talmud, the targum on Nevi&#x27;im was composed by Jonathan ben Uzziel. Like Targum Onkelos on the Torah, Targum Jonathan is an eastern (Babylonian) targum with early origins in the west (Land of Israel).

Like the targum to the Torah, Targum Jonathan to Nevi&#x27;im served a formal liturgical purpose: it was read alternately, verse by verse, or in blocks of up to three verses, in the public reading of the Haftarah and in the study of Nevi&#x27;im. Yemenite Jews continue the above tradition to this day and have thus preserved a living tradition of the Babylonian vocalization for the Targum to Nevi&#x27;im.

<doc id="45708" wikidata="Q499548" url="?curid=45708" title="Coordinate covalent bond">
<text>In coordination chemistry, a coordinate covalent bond, also known as a dative bond, dipolar bond, or coordinate bond is a kind of two-center, two-electron covalent bond in which the two electrons derive from the same atom. The bonding of metal ions to ligands involves this kind of interaction. This type of interaction is central to Lewis acid–base theory.

Coordinate bonds are commonly found in coordination compounds.

== Examples ==

Coordinate covalent bonding is ubiquitous. In all metal aquo-complexes [M(H2O)&quot;n&quot;]&quot;m&quot;+, the bonding between water and the metal cation is described as a coordinate covalent bond. Metal-ligand interactions in most organometallic compounds and most coordination compounds are described similarly.

The term &quot;dipolar bond&quot; is used in organic chemistry for compounds such as amine oxides for which the electronic structure can be described in terms of the basic amine donating two electrons to an oxygen atom.

: → O

The arrow → indicates that both electrons in the bond originate from the amine moiety. In a standard covalent bond each atom contributes one electron. Therefore, an alternative description is that the amine gives away one electron to the oxygen atom, which is then used, with the remaining unpaired electron on the nitrogen atom, to form a standard covalent bond. The process of transferring the electron from nitrogen to oxygen creates formal charges, so the electronic structure may also be depicted as


This electronic structure has an electric dipole, hence the name polar bond. In reality, the atoms carry partial charges; the more electronegative atom of the two involved in the bond will usually carry a partial negative charge. One exception to this is carbon monoxide. In this case, the carbon atom carries the partial negative charge although it is less electronegative than oxygen.

An example of a dative covalent bond is provided by the interaction between a molecule of ammonia, a Lewis base with a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom, and boron trifluoride, a Lewis acid by virtue of the boron atom having an incomplete octet of electrons. In forming the adduct, the boron atom attains an octet configuration.

The electronic structure of a coordination complex can be described in terms of the set of ligands each donating a pair of electrons to a metal centre. For example, in hexamminecobalt(III) chloride, each ammonia ligand donates its lone pair of electrons to the cobalt(III) ion. In this case, the bonds formed are described as coordinate bonds. In the Covalent Bond Classification (CBC) method, ligands that form coordinate covalent bonds with a central atom are classed as L-type, while those that form normal covalent bonds are classed as X-type. 

== Comparison with other electron-sharing modes ==
In all cases, the bond, whether dative or &quot;normal&quot; electron-sharing, is a covalent bond. In common usage, the prefix dipolar, dative or coordinate merely serves to indicate the origin of the electrons used in creating the bond. For example, F3B ← O(C2H5)2 (&quot;boron trifluoride (diethyl) etherate&quot;) is prepared from BF3 and :O(C2H5)2, as opposed to the radical species [•BF3]– and [•O(C2H5)2]+. The dative bond is also a convenience in terms of notation, as formal charges are avoided: we can write D: + []A ⇌ D → A rather than D+–A– (here : and [] represent the lone-pair and empty orbital on the electron-pair donor D and acceptor A, respectively). The notation is sometimes used even when the Lewis acid-base reaction involved is only notional (e.g., the sulfoxide R2S → O is rarely if ever made by reacting the sulfide R2S with atomic oxygen O). Thus, most chemists &quot;do not&quot; make any claim with respect to the properties of the bond when choosing one notation over the other (formal charges vs. arrow bond).

It is generally true, however, that bonds depicted this way are polar covalent, sometimes strongly so, and some authors claim that there are genuine differences in the properties of a dative bond and electron-sharing bond and suggest that showing a dative bond is more appropriate in particular situations. As far back as 1989, Haaland characterized dative bonds as bonds that are (i) weak and long; (ii) with only a small degree of charge-transfer taking place during bond formation; and (iii) whose preferred mode of dissociation in the gas phase (or low ε inert solvent) is heterolytic rather than homolytic. The ammonia-borane adduct (H3N → BH3) is given as a classic example: the bond is weak, with a dissociation energy of 31 kcal/mol (cf. 90 kcal/mol for ethane), and long, at 166 pm (cf. 153 pm for ethane), and the molecule possesses a dipole moment of 5.2 D that implies a transfer of only 0.2 &quot;e&quot;– from nitrogen to boron. The heterolytic dissociation of H3N → BH3 is estimated to require 27 kcal/mol, confirming that heterolysis into ammonia and borane is more favorable than homolysis into radical cation and radical anion. However, aside from clear-cut examples, there is considerable dispute as to when a particular compound qualifies and, thus, the overall prevalence of dative bonding (with respect to an author&#x27;s preferred definition). Computational chemists have suggested quantitative criteria to distinguish between the two &quot;types&quot; of bonding.

Some non-obvious examples where dative bonding is claimed to be important include carbon suboxide (O≡C → C0 ← C≡O), tetraaminoallenes (described using dative bond language as &quot;carbodicarbenes&quot;; (R2N)2C → C0 ← C(NR2)2), the Ramirez carbodiphosphorane (Ph3P → C0 ← PPh3), and bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium cation (Ph3P → N+ ← PPh3), all of which exhibit considerably bent equilibrium geometries, though with a shallow barrier to bending. Simple application of the normal rules for drawing Lewis structures by maximizing bonding (using electron-sharing bonds) and minimizing formal charges would predict heterocumulene structures, and therefore linear geometries, for each of these compounds. Thus, these molecules are claimed to be better modeled as coordination complexes of :C: (carbon(0) or carbone) or :N:+ (mononitrogen cation) with CO, PPh3, or &quot;N-&quot;heterocycliccarbenes as ligands, the lone-pairs on the central atom accounting for the bent geometry. However, the usefulness of this view is disputed.

<text>Forensic science, also known as criminalistics, is the application of science principles and methods to support legal decision-making in matters of criminal and civil law.

During criminal investigation in particular, it is governed by the legal standards of admissible evidence and criminal procedure. It is a broad field utilizing numerous practices such as the analysis of DNA, fingerprints, bloodstain patterns, firearms, ballistics, toxicology, microscopy and fire debris analysis.

Forensic scientists collect, preserve, and analyze evidence during the course of an investigation. While some forensic scientists travel to the scene of the crime to collect the evidence themselves, others occupy a laboratory role, performing analysis on objects brought to them by other individuals. Others are involved in analysis of financial, banking, or other numerical data for use in financial crime investigation, and can be employed as consultants from private firms, academia, or as government employees.

In addition to their laboratory role, forensic scientists testify as expert witnesses in both criminal and civil cases and can work for either the prosecution or the defense. While any field could technically be &quot;forensic&quot;, certain sections have developed over time to encompass the majority of forensically related cases.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;forensic&quot; stems from the Latin word, &quot;forēnsis&quot; (3rd declension, adjective), meaning &quot;of a forum, place of assembly&quot;. The history of the term originates in Roman times, when a criminal charge meant presenting the case before a group of public individuals in the forum. Both the person accused of the crime and the accuser would give speeches based on their sides of the story. The case would be decided in favor of the individual with the best argument and delivery. This origin is the source of the two modern usages of the word &quot;forensic&quot;—as a form of legal evidence; and as a category of public presentation.

In modern use, the term &quot;forensics&quot; is often used in place of &quot;forensic science.&quot;

The word &quot;science&quot;, is derived from the Latin word for &#x27;knowledge&#x27; and is today closely tied to the scientific method, a systematic way of acquiring knowledge. Taken together, forensic science means the use of scientific methods and processes for crime solving.

==History==
===Origins of forensic science and early methods===

The ancient world lacked standardized forensic practices, which enabled criminals to escape punishment. Criminal investigations and trials relied heavily on forced confessions and witness testimony. However, ancient sources do contain several accounts of techniques that foreshadow concepts in forensic science developed centuries later.

The first written account of using medicine and entomology to solve criminal cases is attributed to the book of &quot;Xi Yuan Lu&quot; (translated as &quot;Washing Away of Wrongs&quot;), written in China in 1248 by Song Ci (, 1186–1249), a director of justice, jail and supervision, during the Song dynasty.

Song Ci introduced regulations concerning autopsy reports to court, how to protect the evidence in the examining process, and explained why forensic workers must demonstrate impartiality to the public. He devised methods for making antiseptic and for promoting the reappearance of hidden injuries to dead bodies and bones (using sunlight and vinegar under a red-oil umbrella); for calculating the time of death (allowing for weather and insect activity); described how to wash and examine the dead body to ascertain the reason for death. At that time the book had described methods for distinguishing between suicide and faked suicide. He wrote the book on forensics stating that all wounds or dead bodies should be examined, not avoided. The book became the first form of literature to help determine the cause of death.

In one of Song Ci&#x27;s accounts (&quot;Washing Away of Wrongs&quot;), the case of a person murdered with a sickle was solved by an investigator who instructed each suspect to bring his sickle to one location. (He realized it was a sickle by testing various blades on an animal carcass and comparing the wounds.) Flies, attracted by the smell of blood, eventually gathered on a single sickle. In light of this, the owner of that sickle confessed to the murder. The book also described how to distinguish between a drowning (water in the lungs) and strangulation (broken neck cartilage), and described evidence from examining corpses to determine if a death was caused by murder, suicide or accident.

Methods from around the world involved saliva and examination of the mouth and tongue to determine innocence or guilt, as a precursor to the Polygraph test. In ancient India, some suspects were made to fill their mouths with dried rice and spit it back out. Similarly, in ancient China, those accused of a crime would have rice powder placed in their mouths. In ancient middle-eastern cultures, the accused were made to lick hot metal rods briefly. It is thought that these tests had some validity since a guilty person would produce less saliva and thus have a drier mouth; the accused would be considered guilty if rice was sticking to their mouths in abundance or if their tongues were severely burned due to lack of shielding from saliva.

== Education and training ==
Initial glance, forensic intelligence may appear as a nascent facet of forensic science facilitated by advancements in information technologies such as computers, databases, and data-flow management software. However, a more profound examination reveals that forensic intelligence represents a genuine and emerging inclination among forensic practitioners to actively participate in investigative and policing strategies. In doing so, it elucidates existing practices within scientific literature, advocating for a paradigm shift from the prevailing conception of forensic science as a conglomerate of disciplines merely aiding the criminal justice system. Instead, it urges a perspective that views forensic science as a discipline studying the informative potential of traces—remnants of criminal activity. Embracing this transformative shift poses a significant challenge for education, necessitating a shift in learners&#x27; mindset to accept concepts and methodologies in forensic intelligence.

Recent calls advocating for the integration of forensic scientists into the criminal justice system, as well as policing and intelligence missions, underscore the necessity for the establishment of educational and training initiatives in the field of forensic intelligence. This article contends that a discernible gap exists between the perceived and actual comprehension of forensic intelligence among law enforcement and forensic science managers, positing that this asymmetry can be rectified only through educational interventions 

The primary challenge in forensic intelligence education and training is identified as the formulation of programs aimed at heightening awareness, particularly among managers, to mitigate the risk of making suboptimal decisions in information processing. The paper highlights two recent European courses as exemplars of educational endeavors, elucidating lessons learned and proposing future directions.

The overarching conclusion is that the heightened focus on forensic intelligence has the potential to rejuvenate a proactive approach to forensic science, enhance quantifiable efficiency, and foster greater involvement in investigative and managerial decision-making. A novel educational challenge is articulated for forensic science university programs worldwide: a shift in emphasis from a fragmented criminal trace analysis to a more comprehensive security problem-solving approach.

===Development of forensic science===
In 16th-century Europe, medical practitioners in army and university settings began to gather information on the cause and manner of death. Ambroise Paré, a French army surgeon, systematically studied the effects of violent death on internal organs. Two Italian surgeons, Fortunato Fidelis and Paolo Zacchia, laid the foundation of modern pathology by studying changes that occurred in the structure of the body as the result of disease. In the late 18th century, writings on these topics began to appear. These included &quot;A Treatise on Forensic Medicine and Public Health&quot; by the French physician François-Emmanuel Fodéré and &quot;The Complete System of Police Medicine&quot; by the German medical expert Johann Peter Frank.

As the rational values of the Enlightenment era increasingly permeated society in the 18th century, criminal investigation became a more evidence-based, rational procedure − the use of torture to force confessions was curtailed, and belief in witchcraft and other powers of the occult largely ceased to influence the court&#x27;s decisions. Two examples of English forensic science in individual legal proceedings demonstrate the increasing use of logic and procedure in criminal investigations at the time. In 1784, in Lancaster, John Toms was tried and convicted for murdering Edward Culshaw with a pistol. When the dead body of Culshaw was examined, a pistol wad (crushed paper used to secure powder and balls in the muzzle) found in his head wound matched perfectly with a torn newspaper found in Toms&#x27;s pocket, leading to the conviction.

In Warwick 1816, a farm laborer was tried and convicted of the murder of a young maidservant. She had been drowned in a shallow pool and bore the marks of violent assault. The police found footprints and an impression from corduroy cloth with a sewn patch in the damp earth near the pool. There were also scattered grains of wheat and chaff. The breeches of a farm labourer who had been threshing wheat nearby were examined and corresponded exactly to the impression in the earth near the pool.

An article appearing in Scientific American in 1885 describes the use of microscopy to distinguish between the blood of two persons in a criminal case in Chicago.

=== Chromatography ===
Chromatography is a common technique used in the field of Forensic Science. Chromatography is a method of separating the components of a mixture from a mobile phase. Chromatography is an essential tool used in forensic science, helping analysts identify and compare trace amounts of samples including ignitable liquids, drugs, and biological samples. Many laboratories utilize gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to examine these kinds of samples; this analysis provides rapid and reliant data to identify samples in question.

===Toxicology===
A method for detecting arsenious oxide, simple arsenic, in corpses was devised in 1773 by the Swedish chemist, Carl Wilhelm Scheele. His work was expanded upon, in 1806, by German chemist Valentin Ross, who learned to detect the poison in the walls of a victim&#x27;s stomach. Toxicology, a subfield of forensic chemistry, focuses on detecting and identifying drugs, poisons, and other toxic substances in biological samples. Forensic toxicologists work on cases involving drug overdoses, poisoning, and substance abuse. Their work is critical in determining whether harmful substances play a role in a person’s death or impairment. read more
James Marsh was the first to apply this new science to the art of forensics. He was called by the prosecution in a murder trial to give evidence as a chemist in 1832. The defendant, John Bodle, was accused of poisoning his grandfather with arsenic-laced coffee. Marsh performed the standard test by mixing a suspected sample with hydrogen sulfide and hydrochloric acid. While he was able to detect arsenic as yellow arsenic trisulfide, when it was shown to the jury it had deteriorated, allowing the suspect to be acquitted due to reasonable doubt.

Annoyed by that, Marsh developed a much better test. He combined a sample containing arsenic with sulfuric acid and arsenic-free zinc, resulting in arsine gas. The gas was ignited, and it decomposed to pure metallic arsenic, which, when passed to a cold surface, would appear as a silvery-black deposit. So sensitive was the test, known formally as the Marsh test, that it could detect as little as one-fiftieth of a milligram of arsenic. He first described this test in &quot;The Edinburgh Philosophical Journal&quot; in 1836.

=== Ballistics and firearms ===

Ballistics is &quot;the science of the motion of projectiles in flight&quot;. In forensic science, analysts examine the patterns left on bullets and cartridge casings after being ejected from a weapon. When fired, a bullet is left with indentations and markings that are unique to the barrel and firing pin of the firearm that ejected the bullet. This examination can help scientists identify possible makes and models of weapons connected to a crime.

Henry Goddard at Scotland Yard pioneered the use of bullet comparison in 1835. He noticed a flaw in the bullet that killed the victim and was able to trace this back to the mold that was used in the manufacturing process.

===Anthropometry===

The French police officer Alphonse Bertillon was the first to apply the anthropological technique of anthropometry to law enforcement, thereby creating an identification system based on physical measurements. Before that time, criminals could be identified only by name or photograph. Dissatisfied with the &quot;ad hoc&quot; methods used to identify captured criminals in France in the 1870s, he began his work on developing a reliable system of anthropometrics for human classification.

Bertillon created many other forensics techniques, including forensic document examination, the use of galvanoplastic compounds to preserve footprints, ballistics, and the dynamometer, used to determine the degree of force used in breaking and entering. Although his central methods were soon to be supplanted by fingerprinting, &quot;his other contributions like the mug shot and the systematization of crime-scene photography remain in place to this day.&quot;

===Fingerprints===
Sir William Herschel was one of the first to advocate the use of fingerprinting in the identification of criminal suspects. While working for the Indian Civil Service, he began to use thumbprints on documents as a security measure to prevent the then-rampant repudiation of signatures in 1858.
In 1877 at Hooghly (near Kolkata), Herschel instituted the use of fingerprints on contracts and deeds, and he registered government pensioners&#x27; fingerprints to prevent the collection of money by relatives after a pensioner&#x27;s death.

In 1880, Henry Faulds, a Scottish surgeon in a Tokyo hospital, published his first paper on the subject in the scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot;, discussing the usefulness of fingerprints for identification and proposing a method to record them with printing ink. He established their first classification and was also the first to identify fingerprints left on a vial. Returning to the UK in 1886, he offered the concept to the Metropolitan Police in London, but it was dismissed at that time.

Faulds wrote to Charles Darwin with a description of his method, but, too old and ill to work on it, Darwin gave the information to his cousin, Francis Galton, who was interested in anthropology. Having been thus inspired to study fingerprints for ten years, Galton published a detailed statistical model of fingerprint analysis and identification and encouraged its use in forensic science in his book &quot;Finger Prints&quot;. He had calculated that the chance of a &quot;false positive&quot; (two different individuals having the same fingerprints) was about 1 in 64 billion.
Juan Vucetich, an Argentine chief police officer, created the first method of recording the fingerprints of individuals on file. In 1892, after studying Galton&#x27;s pattern types, Vucetich set up the world&#x27;s first fingerprint bureau. In that same year, Francisca Rojas of Necochea was found in a house with neck injuries whilst her two sons were found dead with their throats cut. Rojas accused a neighbour, but despite brutal interrogation, this neighbour would not confess to the crimes. Inspector Alvarez, a colleague of Vucetich, went to the scene and found a bloody thumb mark on a door. When it was compared with Rojas&#x27; prints, it was found to be identical with her right thumb. She then confessed to the murder of her sons.

A Fingerprint Bureau was established in Calcutta (Kolkata), India, in 1897, after the Council of the Governor General approved a committee report that fingerprints should be used for the classification of criminal records. Working in the Calcutta Anthropometric Bureau, before it became the Fingerprint Bureau, were Azizul Haque and Hem Chandra Bose. Haque and Bose were Indian fingerprint experts who have been credited with the primary development of a fingerprint classification system eventually named after their supervisor, Sir Edward Richard Henry. The Henry Classification System, co-devised by Haque and Bose, was accepted in England and Wales when the first United Kingdom Fingerprint Bureau was founded in Scotland Yard, the Metropolitan Police headquarters, London, in 1901. Sir Edward Richard Henry subsequently achieved improvements in dactyloscopy.

In the United States, Henry P. DeForrest used fingerprinting in the New York Civil Service in 1902, and by December 1905, New York City Police Department Deputy Commissioner Joseph A. Faurot, an expert in the Bertillon system and a fingerprint advocate at Police Headquarters, introduced the fingerprinting of criminals to the United States.

===Uhlenhuth test===
The Uhlenhuth test, or the antigen–antibody precipitin test for species, was invented by Paul Uhlenhuth in 1901 and could distinguish human blood from animal blood, based on the discovery that the blood of different species had one or more characteristic proteins. The test represented a major breakthrough and came to have tremendous importance in forensic science. The test was further refined for forensic use by the Swiss chemist Maurice Müller in the year 1960s.

===DNA===
Forensic DNA analysis was first used in 1984. It was developed by Sir Alec Jeffreys, who realized that variation in the genetic sequence could be used to identify individuals and to tell individuals apart from one another. The first application of DNA profiles was used by Jeffreys in a double murder mystery in the small English town of Narborough, Leicestershire, in 1985. A 15-year-old school girl by the name of Lynda Mann was raped and murdered in Carlton Hayes psychiatric hospital. The police did not find a suspect but were able to obtain a semen sample.

In 1986, Dawn Ashworth, 15 years old, was also raped and strangled in the nearby village of Enderby. Forensic evidence showed that both killers had the same blood type. Richard Buckland became the suspect because he worked at Carlton Hayes psychiatric hospital, had been spotted near Dawn Ashworth&#x27;s murder scene and knew unreleased details about the body. He later confessed to Dawn&#x27;s murder but not Lynda&#x27;s. Jefferys was brought into the case to analyze the semen samples. He concluded that there was no match between the samples and Buckland, who became the first person to be exonerated using DNA. Jefferys confirmed that the DNA profiles were identical for the two murder semen samples. To find the perpetrator, DNA samples from the entire male population, more than 4,000 aged from 17 to 34, of the town were collected. They all were compared to semen samples from the crime. A friend of Colin Pitchfork was heard saying that he had given his sample to the police claiming to be Colin. Colin Pitchfork was arrested in 1987 and it was found that his DNA profile matched the semen samples from the murder.

Because of this case, DNA databases were developed. There is the national (FBI) and international databases as well as the European countries (ENFSI: European Network of Forensic Science Institutes). These searchable databases are used to match crime scene DNA profiles to those already in a database.

===Maturation===
By the turn of the 20th century, the science of forensics had become largely established in the sphere of criminal investigation. Scientific and surgical investigation was widely employed by the Metropolitan Police during their pursuit of the mysterious Jack the Ripper, who had killed a number of women in the 1880s. This case is a watershed in the application of forensic science. Large teams of policemen conducted house-to-house inquiries throughout Whitechapel. Forensic material was collected and examined. Suspects were identified, traced and either examined more closely or eliminated from the inquiry. Police work follows the same pattern today. Over 2000 people were interviewed, &quot;upwards of 300&quot; people were investigated, and 80 people were detained.

The investigation was initially conducted by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), headed by Detective Inspector Edmund Reid. Later, Detective Inspectors Frederick Abberline, Henry Moore, and Walter Andrews were sent from Central Office at Scotland Yard to assist. Initially, butchers, surgeons and physicians were suspected because of the manner of the mutilations. The alibis of local butchers and slaughterers were investigated, with the result that they were eliminated from the inquiry. Some contemporary figures thought the pattern of the murders indicated that the culprit was a butcher or cattle drover on one of the cattle boats that plied between London and mainland Europe. Whitechapel was close to the London Docks, and usually such boats docked on Thursday or Friday and departed on Saturday or Sunday. The cattle boats were examined, but the dates of the murders did not coincide with a single boat&#x27;s movements, and the transfer of a crewman between boats was also ruled out.

At the end of October, Robert Anderson asked police surgeon Thomas Bond to give his opinion on the extent of the murderer&#x27;s surgical skill and knowledge. The opinion offered by Bond on the character of the &quot;Whitechapel murderer&quot; is the earliest surviving offender profile. Bond&#x27;s assessment was based on his own examination of the most extensively mutilated victim and the post mortem notes from the four previous canonical murders. In his opinion the killer must have been a man of solitary habits, subject to &quot;periodical attacks of homicidal and erotic mania&quot;, with the character of the mutilations possibly indicating &quot;satyriasis&quot;. Bond also stated that &quot;the homicidal impulse may have developed from a revengeful or brooding condition of the mind, or that religious mania may have been the original disease but I do not think either hypothesis is likely&quot;.

&quot;Handbook for Coroners, police officials, military policemen&quot; was written by the Austrian criminal jurist Hans Gross in 1893, and is generally acknowledged as the birth of the field of criminalistics. The work combined in one system fields of knowledge that had not been previously integrated, such as psychology and physical science, and which could be successfully used against crime. Gross adapted some fields to the needs of criminal investigation, such as crime scene photography. He went on to found the Institute of Criminalistics in 1912, as part of the University of Graz&#x27; Law School. This Institute was followed by many similar institutes all over the world.

In 1909, Archibald Reiss founded the &quot;Institut de police scientifique&quot; of the University of Lausanne (UNIL), the first school of forensic science in the world. Dr. Edmond Locard, became known as the &quot;Sherlock Holmes of France&quot;. He formulated the basic principle of forensic science: &quot;Every contact leaves a trace&quot;, which became known as Locard&#x27;s exchange principle. In 1910, he founded what may have been the first criminal laboratory in the world, after persuading the Police Department of Lyon (France) to give him two attic rooms and two assistants.

Symbolic of the newfound prestige of forensics and the use of reasoning in detective work was the popularity of the fictional character Sherlock Holmes, written by Arthur Conan Doyle in the late 19th century. He remains a great inspiration for forensic science, especially for the way his acute study of a crime scene yielded small clues as to the precise sequence of events. He made great use of trace evidence such as shoe and tire impressions, as well as fingerprints, ballistics and handwriting analysis, now known as questioned document examination. Such evidence is used to test theories conceived by the police, for example, or by the investigator himself. All of the techniques advocated by Holmes later became reality, but were generally in their infancy at the time Conan Doyle was writing. In many of his reported cases, Holmes frequently complains of the way the crime scene has been contaminated by others, especially by the police, emphasising the critical importance of maintaining its integrity, a now well-known feature of crime scene examination. He used analytical chemistry for blood residue analysis as well as toxicology examination and determination for poisons. He used ballistics by measuring bullet calibres and matching them with a suspected murder weapon.

=== Late 19th – early 20th century figures ===
Hans Gross applied scientific methods to crime scenes and was responsible for the birth of criminalistics.

Edmond Locard expanded on Gross&#x27; work with Locard%27s exchange principle which stated &quot;whenever two objects come into contact with one another, materials are exchanged between them&quot;. This means that every contact by a criminal leaves a trace.

Alexandre Lacassagne, who taught Locard, produced autopsy standards on actual forensic cases.

Alphonse Bertillon was a French criminologist and founder of Anthropometry (scientific study of measurements and proportions of the human body). He used anthropometry for identification, stating that, since each individual is unique, by measuring aspects of physical difference there could be a personal identification system. He created the Bertillon System around 1879, a way of identifying criminals and citizens by measuring 20 parts of the body. In 1884, over 240 repeat offenders were caught using the Bertillon system, but the system was largely superseded by fingerprinting.

Joseph Thomas Walker, known for his work at Massachusetts State Police Chemical Laboratory, for developing many modern forensic techniques which he frequently published in academic journals, and for teaching at the Department of Legal Medicine, Harvard University. 

Frances Glessner Lee, known as &quot;the mother of forensic science&quot;, was instrumental in the development of forensic science in the US. She lobbied to have coroners replaced by medical professionals, endowed the Harvard Associates in Police Science, and conducted many seminars to educate homicide investigators. She also created the Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death, intricate crime scene dioramas used to train investigators, which are still in use today.

===20th century===
Later in the 20th century several British pathologists, Mikey Rochman, Francis Camps, Sydney Smith and Keith Simpson pioneered new forensic science methods. Alec Jeffreys pioneered the use of DNA profiling in forensic science in 1984. He realized the scope of DNA fingerprinting, which uses variations in the genetic code to identify individuals. The method has since become important in forensic science to assist police detective work, and it has also proved useful in resolving paternity and immigration disputes. DNA fingerprinting was first used as a police forensic test to identify the rapist and killer of two teenagers, Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, who were both murdered in Narborough, Leicestershire, in 1983 and 1986 respectively. Colin Pitchfork was identified and convicted of murder after samples taken from him matched semen samples taken from the two dead girls.

Forensic science has been fostered by a number of national and international forensic science learned bodies including the American Academy of Forensic Sciences (founded 1948), publishers of the &quot;Journal of Forensic Sciences&quot;; the Canadian Society of Forensic Science (founded 1953), publishers of the &quot;Journal of the Canadian Society of Forensic Science&quot;; the Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences, (founded 1959), then known as the Forensic Science Society, publisher of &quot;Science &amp; Justice&quot;; the British Academy of Forensic Sciences (founded 1960), publishers of &quot;Medicine, Science and the Law&quot;; the Australian Academy of Forensic Sciences (founded 1967), publishers of the &quot;Australian Journal of Forensic Sciences&quot;; and the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (founded 1995).

=== 21st century ===
In the past decade, documenting forensics scenes has become more efficient. Forensic scientists have started using laser scanners, drones and photogrammetry to obtain 3D point clouds of accidents or crime scenes. Reconstruction of an accident scene on a highway using drones involves data acquisition time of only 10–20 minutes and can be performed without shutting down traffic. The results are not just accurate, in centimeters, for measurement to be presented in court but also easy to digitally preserve in the long term.
Now, in the 21st century, much of forensic science&#x27;s future is up for discussion. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has several forensic science-related programs: CSAFE, a NIST Center of Excellence in Forensic Science, the National Commission on Forensic Science (now concluded), and administration of the Organization of Scientific Area Committees for Forensic Science (OSAC). One of the more recent additions by NIST is a document called NISTIR-7941, titled &quot;Forensic Science Laboratories: Handbook for Facility Planning, Design, Construction, and Relocation&quot;. The handbook provides a clear blueprint for approaching forensic science. The details even include what type of staff should be hired for certain positions.

== Subdivisions ==

* Art forensics concerns the art authentication cases to help research the work&#x27;s authenticity. Art authentication methods are used to detect and identify forgery, faking and copying of art works, e.g. paintings.
* Bloodstain pattern analysis is the scientific examination of blood spatter patterns found at a crime scene to reconstruct the events of the crime.
* Comparative forensics is the application of visual comparison techniques to verify similarity of physical evidence. This includes fingerprint analysis, toolmark analysis, and ballistic analysis.
* Computational forensics concerns the development of algorithms and software to assist forensic examination.
* Criminalistics is the application of various sciences to answer questions relating to examination and comparison of biological evidence, trace evidence, impression evidence (such as fingerprints, footwear impressions, and tire tracks), controlled substances, ballistics, firearm and toolmark examination, and other evidence in criminal investigations. In typical circumstances, evidence is processed in a crime lab.
* Digital forensics is the application of proven scientific methods and techniques in order to recover data from electronic / digital media. Digital Forensic specialists work in the field as well as in the lab.
* Ear print analysis is used as a means of forensic identification intended as an identification tool similar to fingerprinting. An earprint is a two-dimensional reproduction of the parts of the outer ear that have touched a specific surface (most commonly the helix, antihelix, tragus and antitragus).
* Election forensics is the use of statistics to determine if election results are normal or abnormal. It is also used to look into and detect the cases concerning gerrymandering.
* Forensic accounting is the study and interpretation of accounting evidence, financial statement namely: Balance sheet, Income statement, Cash flow statement.
* Forensic aerial photography is the study and interpretation of aerial photographic evidence.
* Forensic anthropology is the application of physical anthropology in a legal setting, usually for the recovery and identification of skeletonized human remains.

* Forensic dactyloscopy is the study of fingerprints.
* Forensic document examination or questioned document examination answers questions about a disputed document using a variety of scientific processes and methods. Many examinations involve a comparison of the questioned document, or components of the document, with a set of known standards. The most common type of examination involves handwriting, whereby the examiner tries to address concerns about potential authorship.
* Forensic DNA analysis takes advantage of the uniqueness of an individual&#x27;s DNA to answer forensic questions such as paternity/maternity testing and placing a suspect at a crime scene, e.g. in a rape investigation.
* Forensic engineering is the scientific examination and analysis of structures and products relating to their failure or cause of damage.
* Forensic entomology deals with the examination of insects in, on and around human remains to assist in determination of time or location of death. It is also possible to determine if the body was moved after death using entomology.
* Forensic geology deals with trace evidence in the form of soils, minerals and petroleum.
* Forensic geomorphology is the study of the ground surface to look for potential location(s) of buried object(s).
* Forensic geophysics is the application of geophysical techniques such as radar for detecting objects hidden underground or underwater.
* Forensic intelligence process starts with the collection of data and ends with the integration of results within into the analysis of crimes under investigation.
* Forensic interviews are conducted using the science of professionally using expertise to conduct a variety of investigative interviews with victims, witnesses, suspects or other sources to determine the facts regarding suspicions, allegations or specific incidents in either public or private sector settings.
* Forensic histopathology is the application of histological techniques and examination to forensic pathology practice.

* Wildlife forensic science applies a range of scientific disciplines to legal cases involving non-human biological evidence, to solve crimes such as poaching, animal abuse, and trade in endangered species.

== Questionable techniques ==
Some forensic techniques, believed to be scientifically sound at the time they were used, have turned out later to have much less scientific merit or none. Some such techniques include:
* Comparative bullet-lead analysis was used by the FBI for over four decades, starting with the John F. Kennedy assassination in 1963. The theory was that each batch of ammunition possessed a chemical makeup so distinct that a bullet could be traced back to a particular batch or even a specific box. Internal studies and an outside study by the National Academy of Sciences found that the technique was unreliable due to improper interpretation, and the FBI abandoned the test in 2005.
* Forensic dentistry has come under fire: in at least three cases bite-mark evidence has been used to convict people of murder who were later freed by DNA evidence. A 1999 study by a member of the American Board of Forensic Odontology found a 63 percent rate of false identifications and is commonly referenced within online news stories and conspiracy websites. The study was based on an informal workshop during an ABFO meeting, which many members did not consider a valid scientific setting. The theory is that each person has a unique and distinctive set of teeth, which leave a pattern after biting someone. They analyze the dental characteristics such as size, shape, and arch form.
* Police Access to Genetic Genealogy Databases: There are privacy concerns with the police being able to access personal genetic data that is on genealogy services. Individuals can become criminal informants to their own families or to themselves simply by participating in genetic genealogy databases. The Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) is a database that the FBI uses to hold genetic profiles of all known felons, misdemeanants, and arrestees. Some people argue that individuals who are using genealogy databases should have an expectation of privacy in their data that is or may be violated by genetic searches by law enforcement. These different services have warning signs about potential third parties using their information, but most individuals do not read the agreement thoroughly. According to a study by Christi Guerrini, Jill Robinson, Devan Petersen, and Amy McGuire, they found that the majority of the people who took the survey support police searches of genetic websites that identify genetic relatives. People who responded to the survey are more supportive of police activities using genetic genealogy when it is for the purpose of identifying offenders of violent crimes, suspects of crimes against children or missing people. The data from the surveys that were given show that individuals are not concerned about police searches using personal genetic data if it is justified. It was found in this study that offenders are disproportionally low-income and black and the average person of genetic testing is wealthy and white. The results from the study had different results. In 2016, there was a survey called the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) that was provided by the US Bureau of Justice Statistics. In that survey, it was found that 1.3% of people aged 12 or older were victims of violent crimes, and 8.85 of households were victims of property crimes. There were some issues with this survey though. The NCVS produces only the annual estimates of victimization. The survey that Christi Guerrini, Jill Robinson, Devan Petersen, and Amy McGuire produced asked the participants about the incidents of victimization over one&#x27;s lifetime. Their survey also did not restrict other family members to one household. Around 25% of people who responded to the survey said that they have had family members that have been employed by law enforcement which includes security guards and bailiffs. Throughout these surveys, it has been found that there is public support for law enforcement to access genetic genealogy databases.

== Litigation science ==
&quot;Litigation science&quot; describes analysis or data developed or produced &quot;expressly&quot; for use in a trial versus those produced in the course of independent research. This distinction was made by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals when evaluating the admissibility of experts.

This uses demonstrative evidence, which is evidence created in preparation of trial by attorneys or paralegals.

==Demographics==
In the United States there are over 17,200 forensic science technicians as of 2019.

==Media impact==
Real-life crime scene investigators and forensic scientists warn that popular television shows do not give a realistic picture of the work, often wildly distorting its nature, and exaggerating the ease, speed, effectiveness, drama, glamour, influence and comfort level of their jobs—which they describe as far more mundane, tedious and boring.

Some claim these modern TV shows have changed individuals&#x27; expectations of forensic science, sometimes unrealistically—an influence termed the &quot;CSI effect&quot;.

Further, research has suggested that public misperceptions about criminal forensics can create, in the mind of a juror, unrealistic expectations of forensic evidence—which they expect to see before convicting—implicitly biasing the juror towards the defendant. Citing the &quot;CSI effect,&quot; at least one researcher has suggested screening jurors for their level of influence from such TV programs.

==Controversies==
Questions about certain areas of forensic science, such as fingerprint evidence and the assumptions behind these disciplines have been brought to light in some publications including the &quot;New York Post&quot;. The article stated that &quot;No one has proved even the basic assumption: That everyone&#x27;s fingerprint is unique.&quot; The article also stated that &quot;Now such assumptions are being questioned—and with it may come a radical change in how forensic science is used by police departments and prosecutors.&quot; Law professor Jessica Gabel said on NOVA that forensic science &quot;lacks the rigors, the standards, the quality controls and procedures that we find, usually, in science&quot;.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology has reviewed the scientific foundations of bite-mark analysis used in forensic science. Bite mark analysis is a forensic science technique that analyzes the marks on the victim&#x27;s skin compared to the suspects teeth. NIST reviewed the findings of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2009 study. The National Academics of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conducted research to address the issues of reliability, accuracy, and reliability of bitemark analysis, where they concluded that there is a lack of sufficient scientific foundation to support the data. Yet the technique is still legal to use in court as evidence. NIST funded a 2019 meeting that consisted of dentists, lawyers, researchers and others to address the gaps in this field.

In the US, on 25 June 2009, the Supreme Court issued a 5-to-4 decision in &quot;Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts&quot; stating that crime laboratory reports may not be used against criminal defendants at trial unless the analysts responsible for creating them give testimony and subject themselves to cross-examination. The Supreme Court cited the National Academies of Sciences report &quot;Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States&quot; in their decision. Writing for the majority, Justice Antonin Scalia referred to the National Research Council report in his assertion that &quot;Forensic evidence is not uniquely immune from the risk of manipulation.&quot;

In the US, another area of forensic science that has come under question in recent years is the lack of laws requiring the accreditation of forensic labs. Some states require accreditation, but some states do not. Because of this, many labs have been caught performing very poor work resulting in false convictions or acquittals. For example, it was discovered after an audit of the Houston Police Department in 2002 that the lab had fabricated evidence which led George Rodriguez being convicted of raping a fourteen-year-old girl. The former director of the lab, when asked, said that the total number of cases that could have been contaminated by improper work could be in the range of 5,000 to 10,000.

The Innocence Project database of DNA exonerations shows that many wrongful convictions contained forensic science errors. According to the Innocence project and the US Department of Justice, forensic science has contributed to about 39 percent to 46 percent of wrongful convictions. As indicated by the National Academy of Sciences report &quot;Strengthening Forensic Sciences in the United States&quot;, part of the problem is that many traditional forensic sciences have never been empirically validated; and part of the problem is that all examiners are subject to forensic confirmation biases and should be shielded from contextual information not relevant to the judgment they make.

Many studies have discovered a difference in rape-related injuries reporting based on race, with white victims reporting a higher frequency of injuries than black victims. However, since current forensic examination techniques may not be sensitive to all injuries across a range of skin colors, more research needs to be conducted to understand if this trend is due to skin confounding healthcare providers when examining injuries or if darker skin extends a protective element. In clinical practice, for patients with darker skin, one study recommends that attention must be paid to the thighs, labia majora, posterior fourchette and fossa navicularis, so that no rape-related injuries are missed upon close examination.

== Forensic science and humanitarian work ==
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) uses forensic science for humanitarian purposes to clarify the fate of missing persons after armed conflict, disasters or migration, and is one of the services related to Restoring Family Links and Missing Persons. Knowing what has happened to a missing relative can often make it easier to proceed with the grieving process and move on with life for families of missing persons.

Forensic science is used by various other organizations to clarify the fate and whereabouts of persons who have gone missing. Examples include the NGO Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team, working to clarify the fate of people who disappeared during the period of the 1976–1983 military dictatorship. The International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) used forensic science to find missing persons, for example after the conflicts in the Balkans.

Recognising the role of forensic science for humanitarian purposes, as well as the importance of forensic investigations in fulfilling the state&#x27;s responsibilities to investigate human rights violations, a group of experts in the late-1980s devised a UN Manual on the Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, which became known as the Minnesota Protocol. This document was revised and re-published by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in 2016.

<text>Eggplant (US, CA, AU, NZ, PH), aubergine (UK, IE), brinjal (IN, SG, MY, ZA), or baigan (IN, GY) is a plant species in the nightshade family Solanaceae. Solanum melongena is grown worldwide for its edible fruit.

Most commonly purple, the spongy, absorbent fruit is used in several cuisines. Typically used as a vegetable in cooking, it is a berry by botanical definition. As a member of the genus &quot;Solanum&quot;, it is related to the tomato, chili pepper, and potato, although those are of the New World while the eggplant is of the Old World. Like the tomato, its skin and seeds can be eaten, but it is usually eaten cooked. Eggplant is nutritionally low in macronutrient and micronutrient content, but the capability of the fruit to absorb oils and flavors into its flesh through cooking expands its use in the culinary arts.

It was originally domesticated from the wild nightshade species &quot;thorn&quot; or &quot;bitter apple&quot;, &quot;S. incanum&quot;, probably with two independent domestications: one in South Asia, and one in East Asia. In 2021, world production of eggplants was 59 million tonnes, with China and India combined accounting for 86% of the total.

==Description==
The eggplant is a delicate, tropical perennial plant often cultivated as a tender or half-hardy annual in temperate climates. The stem is often spiny. The flowers are white to purple in color, with a five-lobed corolla and yellow stamens. Some common cultivars have fruit that is egg-shaped, glossy, and purple with white flesh and a spongy, &quot;meaty&quot; texture. Some other cultivars are white and longer in shape. The cut surface of the flesh rapidly turns brown when the fruit is cut open (oxidation).

Eggplant grows tall, with large, coarsely lobed leaves that are long and broad. Semiwild types can grow much larger, to , with large leaves over long and broad. On wild plants, the fruit is less than in diameter

Botanically classified as a berry, the fruit contains numerous small, soft, edible seeds that taste bitter because they contain or are covered in nicotinoid alkaloids, like the related tobacco.

The eggplant genome has 12 chromosomes.

== History ==

There is no consensus about the place of origin of eggplant; the plant species has been described as native to South Asia, where it continues to grow wild, or Africa. It has been cultivated in southern and eastern Asia since prehistory. The first known written record of the plant is found in &quot;Qimin Yaoshu&quot;, an ancient Chinese agricultural treatise completed in 544 CE.

Eggplant was introduced to Europe through the Iberian Peninsula, where it became a staple among Muslim and Jewish communities. The presence of numerous Arabic and North African names for the vegetable, coupled with the absence of ancient Greek and Roman names, suggests that it was cultivated in the Mediterranean area by Arabs during the early Middle Ages, arriving in Spain in the 8th century. A book on agriculture by Ibn Al-Awwam in 12th-century Muslim Spain described how to grow aubergines. Records exist from later medieval Catalan and Spanish, as well as from 14th-century Italy. Unlike its popularity in Spain and limited presence in southern Italy, the eggplant remained relatively obscure in other regions of Europe until the 17th century.

The aubergine is unrecorded in England until the 16th century. An English botany book in 1597 described the madde or raging Apple:

The Europeans brought it to the Americas.

Because of the plant&#x27;s relationship with various other nightshades, the fruit was at one time believed to be extremely poisonous. The flowers and leaves can be poisonous if consumed in large quantities due to the presence of solanine.

The eggplant has a special place in folklore. In 13th-century Italian traditional folklore, the eggplant can cause insanity. In 19th-century Egypt, insanity was said to be &quot;more common and more violent&quot; when the eggplant is in season in the summer.

==Etymology and regional names==
The plant and fruit have a profusion of English names.

===&quot;Eggplant&quot;-type names===

The name &quot;eggplant&quot; is usual in North American English and Australian English. First recorded in 1763, the word &quot;eggplant&quot; was originally applied to white cultivars, which look very much like hen&#x27;s eggs (see image). Similar names are widespread in other languages, such as the Icelandic term &quot;eggaldin&quot; or the Welsh &quot;planhigyn ŵy&quot;.

The white, egg-shaped varieties of the eggplant&#x27;s fruits are also known as &quot;garden eggs&quot;, a term first attested in 1811. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; records that between 1797 and 1888, the name &quot;vegetable egg&quot; was also used.

===&quot;Aubergine&quot;-type names===
Whereas &quot;eggplant&quot; was coined in English, most of the diverse other European names for the plant derive from the &quot;bāḏinjān&quot; . &quot;Bāḏinjān&quot; is itself a loan-word in Arabic, whose earliest traceable origins lie in the Dravidian languages. The &quot;Hobson-Jobson&quot; dictionary comments that &quot;probably there is no word of the kind which has undergone such extraordinary variety of modifications, whilst retaining the same meaning, as this&quot;.

In English usage, modern names deriving from Arabic &quot;bāḏinjān&quot; include:
* &quot;Aubergine&quot;, usual in British English (as well as German, French and Dutch).
* &quot;Brinjal&quot; or &quot;brinjaul&quot;, usual in South Asia and South African English.
* &quot;Solanum melongena&quot;, the Linnaean name.

====From Dravidian to Arabic====

All the &quot;aubergine&quot;-type names have the same origin, in the Dravidian languages. Modern descendants of this ancient Dravidian word include Malayalam &quot;vaṟutina&quot; and Tamil &quot;vaṟutuṇai&quot;.

The Dravidian word was borrowed into the Indo-Aryan languages, giving ancient forms such as Sanskrit and Pali &quot;vātiṅ-gaṇa&quot; (alongside Sanskrit &quot;vātigama&quot;) and Prakrit &quot;vāiṃaṇa&quot;. According to the entry &quot;brinjal&quot; in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the Sanskrit word &quot;vātin-gāna&quot; denoted &#x27;the class (that removes) the wind-disorder (windy humour)&#x27;: that is, &quot;vātin-gāna&quot; came to be the name for eggplants because they were thought to cure flatulence. The modern Hindustani words descending directly from the Sanskrit name are &quot;baingan&quot; and &quot;began&quot;.

The Indic word &quot;vātiṅ-gaṇa&quot; was then borrowed into Persian as &quot;bādingān&quot;. Persian &quot;bādingān&quot; was borrowed in turn into Arabic as &quot;bāḏinjān&quot; (or, with the definite article, &quot;al-bāḏinjān&quot;). From Arabic, the word was borrowed into European languages.

====From Arabic into Iberia and beyond====
In al-Andalus, the Arabic word &quot;(al-)bāḏinjān&quot; was borrowed into the Romance languages in forms beginning with &quot;b&quot;- or, with the definite article included, &quot;alb&quot;-:
* Portuguese , , .
* Spanish , .

The Spanish word was then borrowed into French, giving (along with French dialectal forms like , , , and ). The French name was then borrowed into British English, appearing there first in the late eighteenth century.

Through the colonial expansion of Portugal, the Portuguese form was borrowed into a variety of other languages:
* Indian, Malaysian, Singaporean and South African English &quot;brinjal&quot;, &quot;brinjaul&quot; (first attested in the seventeenth century).
* West Indian English &quot;brinjalle&quot; and (through folk-etymology) &quot;brown-jolly&quot;.
* French &quot;bringelle&quot; in La Réunion.

Thus although Indian English &quot;brinjal&quot; ultimately originates in languages of the Indian Subcontinent, it actually came into Indian English via Portuguese.

====From Arabic into Greek and beyond====

The Arabic word &quot;bāḏinjān&quot; was borrowed into Greek by the eleventh century CE. The Greek loans took a variety of forms, but crucially they began with &quot;m-&quot;, partly because Greek lacked the initial &quot;b-&quot; sound and partly through folk-etymological association with the Greek word &quot;μέλας&quot; (&quot;melas&quot;), &#x27;black&#x27;. Attested Greek forms include &quot;ματιζάνιον&quot; (&quot;matizanion&quot;, eleventh-century), &quot;μελιντζάνα&quot; (&quot;melintzana&quot;, fourteenth-century), and &quot;μελιντζάνιον&quot; (&quot;melintzanion&quot;, seventeenth-century).

From Greek, the word was borrowed into Italian and medieval Latin, and onwards into French. Early forms include:
* &quot;Melanzāna&quot;, recorded in Sicilian in the twelfth century.
* &quot;Melongena&quot;, recorded in Latin in the thirteenth century.
* &quot;Melongiana&quot;, recorded in Veronese in the fourteenth century.
* &quot;Melanjan&quot;, recorded in Old French.

From these forms came the botanical Latin &quot;melongēna&quot;. This was used by Tournefort as a genus name in 1700, then by Linnaeus as a species name in 1753. It remains in scientific use.

These forms also gave rise to the Caribbean English &quot;melongene&quot;.

The Italian &quot;melanzana&quot;, through folk-etymology, was adapted to &quot;mela insana&quot; (&#x27;mad apple&#x27;): already by the thirteenth century, this name had given rise to a tradition that eggplants could cause insanity. Translated into English as &#x27;mad-apple&#x27;, &#x27;rage-apple&#x27;, or &#x27;raging apple&#x27;, this name for eggplants is attested from 1578 and the form &#x27;mad-apple&#x27; may still be found in Southern American English.

===Other English names===

The plant is also known as &quot;guinea squash&quot; in Southern American English. The term &quot;guinea&quot; in the name originally denoted the fact that the fruits were associated with West Africa, specifically the region that is now the modern day country Guinea.

It has been known as &#x27;Jew&#x27;s apple&#x27;, apparently in relation to a belief that the fruit was first imported to the West Indies by Jewish people.

==Cultivars==


Different cultivars of the plant produce fruit of different size, shape, and color, though typically purple. The less common white varieties of eggplant are also known as Easter white eggplants, garden eggs, Casper or white eggplant. The most widely cultivated varieties—cultivars—in Europe and North America today are elongated ovoid, long and broad with a dark purple skin.

A much wider range of shapes, sizes, and colors is grown in India and elsewhere in Asia. Larger cultivars weighing up to a kilogram (2.2 pounds) grow in the region between the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers, while smaller ones are found elsewhere. Colors vary from white to yellow or green, as well as reddish-purple and dark purple. Some cultivars have a color gradient—white at the stem, to bright pink, deep purple or even black. Green or purple cultivars with white striping also exist. Chinese cultivars are commonly shaped like a narrower, slightly pendulous cucumber. Also, Asian cultivars of Japanese breeding are grown.
* Oval or elongated oval-shaped and black-skinned cultivars include &#x27;Harris Special Hibush&#x27;, &#x27;Burpee Hybrid&#x27;, &#x27;Bringal Bloom&#x27;, &#x27;Black Magic&#x27;, &#x27;Classic&#x27;, &#x27;Dusky&#x27;, and &#x27;Black Beauty&#x27;.
* Slim cultivars in purple-black skin include &#x27;Little Fingers&#x27;, &#x27;Ichiban&#x27;, &#x27;Pingtung Long&#x27;, and &#x27;Tycoon&#x27;
** In green skin, &#x27;Louisiana Long Green&#x27; and &#x27;Thai (Long) Green&#x27;
** In white skin, &#x27;Dourga&#x27;.
* Traditional, white-skinned, egg-shaped cultivars include &#x27;Casper&#x27; and &#x27;Easter Egg&#x27;.
* Bicolored cultivars with color gradient include &#x27;Rosa Bianca&#x27;, &#x27;Violetta di Firenze&#x27;, &#x27;Bianca Sfumata di Rosa&#x27; (heirloom), and &#x27;Prosperosa&#x27; (heirloom).
* Bicolored cultivars with striping include &#x27;Listada de Gandia&#x27; and &#x27;Udumalapet&#x27;.
* In some parts of India, miniature cultivars, most commonly called &quot;baigan,&quot; are popular.

=== Varieties ===
* &quot;S. m.&quot; var. &quot;esculentum&quot; – common aubergine, including white varieties, with many cultivars
* &quot;S. m.&quot; var. &quot;depressum&quot; – dwarf aubergine
* &quot;S. m.&quot; var. &quot;serpentium&quot; – snake aubergine

====Genetically engineered eggplant====
Bt brinjal is a transgenic eggplant that contains a gene from the soil bacterium &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot;. This variety was designed to give the plant resistance to lepidopteran insects such as the brinjal fruit and shoot borer (&quot;Leucinodes orbonalis&quot;) and fruit borer (&quot;Helicoverpa armigera&quot;).

On 9 February 2010, the Environment Ministry of India imposed a moratorium on the cultivation of Bt brinjal after protests against regulatory approval of cultivated Bt brinjal in 2009, stating the moratorium would last &quot;for as long as it is needed to establish public trust and confidence&quot;. This decision was deemed controversial, as it deviated from previous practices with other genetically modified crops in India. Bt brinjal was approved for commercial cultivation in Bangladesh in 2013.

==Uses==
===Culinary===
Raw eggplant can have a bitter taste, with an astringent quality, but it becomes tender when cooked and develops a rich, complex flavor. Rinsing, draining, and salting the sliced fruit before cooking may remove the bitterness. The fruit is capable of absorbing cooking fats and sauces, which may enhance the flavor of eggplant dishes.

Eggplant is used in the cuisines of many countries. Due to its texture and bulk, it is sometimes used as a meat substitute in vegan and vegetarian cuisines. Eggplant flesh is smooth. Its numerous seeds are small, soft and edible, along with the rest of the fruit, and do not have to be removed. Its thin skin is also edible, and so it does not have to be peeled. However, the green part at the top, the calyx, does have to be removed when preparing an eggplant for cooking.

Eggplant can be steamed, stir-fried, pan fried, deep fried, barbecued, roasted, stewed, curried, or pickled. Many eggplant dishes are sauces made by mashing the cooked fruit. It can be stuffed. It is frequently, but not always, cooked with oil or fat.

==== East Asia ====
Korean and Japanese eggplant varieties are typically thin-skinned.

In Chinese cuisine, eggplants are known as &quot;qiézi&quot; (). They are often deep fried and made into dishes such as &quot;yúxiāng-qiézi&quot; (&quot;fish fragrance eggplant&quot;) or &quot;di sān xiān&quot; (&quot;three earthen treasures&quot;). Elsewhere in China, such as in Yunnan cuisine (in particular the cuisine of the Dai people) they are barbecued or roasted, then split and either eaten directly with garlic, chilli, oil and coriander, or the flesh is removed and pounded to a mash (typically with a wooden pestle and mortar) before being eaten with rice or other dishes.

In Japanese cuisine, eggplants are known as &quot;nasu&quot; or &quot;nasubi&quot; and use the same characters as Chinese (). An example of it use is in the dish &quot;hasamiyaki&quot; () in which slices of eggplant are grilled and filled with a meat stuffing. Eggplants also feature in several Japanese expression and proverbs, such as (because their lack of seeds will reduce her fertility) and .

In Korean cuisine, eggplants are known as &quot;gaji&quot; (). They are steamed, stir-fried, or pan-fried and eaten as banchan (side dishes), such as &quot;namul&quot;, &quot;bokkeum&quot;, and &quot;jeon&quot;.

==== Southeast Asia ====
In the Philippines, eggplants are of the long and slender purple variety. They are known as &quot;talong&quot; and is widely used in many stew and soup dishes, like &quot;pinakbet&quot;. However the most popular eggplant dish is &quot;tortang talong&quot;, an omelette made from grilling an eggplant, dipping it into beaten eggs, and pan-frying the mixture. The dish is characteristically served with the stalk attached. The dish has several variants, including &quot;rellenong talong&quot; which is stuffed with meat and vegetables. Eggplant can also be grilled, skinned and eaten as a salad called &quot;ensaladang talong&quot;. Another popular dish is &quot;adobong talong&quot;, which is diced eggplant prepared with vinegar, soy sauce, and garlic as an &quot;adobo&quot;.

==== South Asia ====
Eggplant is widely used in its native India, for example in &quot;sambar&quot; (a tamarind lentil stew), &quot;dalma&quot; (a &quot;dal&quot; preparation with vegetables, native to Odisha), chutney, curry (vankai), and &quot;achaar&quot; (a pickled dish). Owing to its versatile nature and wide use in both everyday and festive Indian food, it is often described as the &quot;king of vegetables&quot;. Roasted, skinned, mashed, mixed with onions, tomatoes, and spices, and then slow cooked gives the South Asian dish &quot;baingan bharta&quot; or &quot;gojju&quot;, similar to &quot;salată de vinete&quot; in Romania. Another version of the dish, &quot;begun-pora&quot; (eggplant charred or burnt), is very popular in Bangladesh and the east Indian states of Odisha and West Bengal where the pulp of the vegetable is mixed with raw chopped shallot, green chilies, salt, fresh coriander, and mustard oil. Sometimes fried tomatoes and deep-fried potatoes are also added, creating a dish called &quot;begun bhorta&quot;. In a dish from Maharashtra called , small brinjals are stuffed with ground coconut, peanuts, onions, tamarind, jaggery and masala spices, and then cooked in oil. Maharashtra and the adjacent state of Karnataka also have an eggplant-based vegetarian pilaf called &#x27;vangi bhat&#x27;.

==== Middle East and the Mediterranean ====
Eggplant is often stewed, as in the French &quot;ratatouille&quot;, or deep-fried as in the Italian &quot;parmigiana di melanzane&quot;, the Turkish &quot;karnıyarık&quot;, or Turkish, Greek, and Levantine &quot;musakka/moussaka&quot;, and Middle Eastern and South Asian dishes. Eggplants can also be battered before deep-frying and served with a sauce made of tahini and tamarind. In Iranian cuisine, it is blended with whey as &quot;kashk e bademjan&quot;, tomatoes as &quot;mirza ghassemi&quot;, or made into stew as &quot;khoresht-e-bademjan&quot;. It can be sliced and deep-fried, then served with plain yogurt (optionally topped with a tomato and garlic sauce), such as in the Turkish dish &quot;patlıcan kızartması&quot; (meaning fried aubergines), or without yogurt, as in &quot;patlıcan şakşuka&quot;. Perhaps the best-known Turkish eggplant dishes are &quot;imam bayıldı&quot; (vegetarian) and &quot;karnıyarık&quot; (with minced meat). It may also be roasted in its skin until charred, so the pulp can be removed and blended with other ingredients, such as lemon, tahini, and garlic, as in the Levantine &quot;baba ghanoush,&quot; Greek &quot;melitzanosalata,&quot; Moroccan &quot;zaalouk&quot; and Romanian &quot;salată de vinete&quot;. A mix of roasted eggplant, roasted red peppers, chopped onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, carrots, celery, and spices is called &quot;zacuscă&quot; in Romania, and &quot;ajvar&quot; or &quot;pinjur&quot; in the Balkans.

A Spanish dish called &quot;escalivada&quot; in Catalonia calls for strips of roasted aubergine, sweet pepper, onion, and tomato. In Andalusia, eggplant is mostly cooked thinly sliced, deep-fried in olive oil and served hot with honey (&quot;berenjenas a la Cordobesa&quot;). In the La Mancha region of central Spain, a small eggplant is pickled in vinegar, paprika, olive oil, and red peppers. The result is berenjena of Almagro, Ciudad Real. A Levantine specialty is &quot;makdous&quot;, another pickling of eggplants, stuffed with red peppers and walnuts in olive oil. Eggplant can be hollowed out and stuffed with meat, rice, or other fillings, and then baked. In Georgia, for example, it is fried and stuffed with walnut paste to make &quot;nigvziani badrijani&quot;.

In medieval Spain, eggplant, along with ingredients such as Swiss chard and chickpeas, was closely associated with Jewish cuisine. The &quot;Kitāb al-Ṭabikh&quot;, a 13th-century Andalusian cookbook, features eggplant as the main ingredient in fifteen out of its nineteen vegetable dishes, indicating its significance in the local cuisine at the time. Jewish communities in Spain prepared eggplant in various ways, including in dishes like &quot;almodrote&quot;, a casserole of eggplant and cheese. This dish and others became identifiers for Jews during their expulsion from Spain and the Inquisition, and they were carried by the expelled Jews to their new homes in the Ottoman Empire. The classic Judaeo-Spanish song &quot;Siete modos de gizar la berendgena&quot; lists various methods of preparing eggplant that persisted among Jews in the Ottoman Empire. Today, eggplant remains a defining ingredient of Sephardic Jewish cuisine.

==== Iran ====
In Iranian cuisine, eggplant (called &quot;bādenjān&quot; or &quot;bādemjān&quot; in Persian) can be used in both appetizers and main courses. It can also be pickled in vinegar. The ideal eggplant in Iranian cuisine is long, straight, firm, and black. Based on how al-Razi uses the color of eggplant as a shorthand for purpleness in his &quot;Kitab al-hawi&quot;, it can be assumed that the dark purple kind of eggplant was the widely grown variety in Iran at his time (9th century). Its importance in Iran is alluded to in the &quot;Ain-i-Akbari&quot; of Abu&#x27;l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, which says &quot;this vegetable is on sale in the markets in Iran all the year round and in such abundance that it is sold for 1.5 &quot;dam&quot;s per seer&quot; (which was a cheap price at that time).

In Iran, unlike places like Greece, Turkey, and North Africa, eggplant is cooked peeled and usually seasoned with cinnamon or especially turmeric. Most eggplant dishes are classified as &quot;nankhoreshi&quot; (eaten with bread), and they are commonly served as snacks alongside alcoholic beverages.

The 14th-century poet Boshaq At&#x27;ema refers to an early eggplant dish called &quot;burani-e badenjan&quot;: chopped eggplant sautéed with onions and turmeric, then slowly cooked, and finally mixed with yogurt. The combination of eggplant and kashk (condensed whey) is popular in Iranian cuisine; it is found in dishes like &quot;kashk o badenjan&quot; as well as &quot;ash-e kashk o badenjan&quot; (involving layers of sautéed eggplant, grilled onions, and red beans topped by kashk seasoned with turmeric). Another eggplant dish is &quot;mast o badenjan&quot;, also known as &quot;nazkhatun&quot; in Tehran, which involves eggplant, yogurt, and dried mint. Eggplant can also be cooked in stews (&quot;khoresh&quot;es), either with lamb (&quot;khoresh-e badenjan&quot;) or with chicken and either unripe grapes or pomegranate juice (&quot;mosamma-ye badenjan&quot;). Variants of ab-gusht, eshkana, fesenjan, and kuku also make use of eggplant. Some regional dishes involving eggplant include &quot;badenjan-polow&quot;, a dish mainly from Fars and Kerman that combines white rice with a paste of chopped sautéed eggplant, chopped meat, and spices; as well as the northern Iranian &quot;badenjan-e qasemi&quot;, a casserole using grilled eggplant, garlic, tomatoes, and eggs.

Eggplants are traditionally among the foods that get preserved and stored for winter in Iran. They are selected in the last month of summer, when they are most readily available, then peeled, and finally preserved in one of two ways. In the first way, the peeled eggplants are cut, salted, and left to &quot;sweat&quot; (to make them less bilious); then they are sun-dried by hanging them on a line. The dried eggplants are then rehydrated 24 hours before being cooked. In the second way, the peeled eggplants are cooked in oil, put in a copper pot, and finally covered with plenty of hot oil, &quot;which congeals to seal them&quot;.

Medieval Iranian writers such as al-Razi and al-Biruni cautioned that eggplant contains harmful qualities, and it must be ripe and cooked before eating to neutralize them. They wrote that it could cause heat and dryness and an excess of black bile, contributing to a wide range of health problems. If the &quot;salt&quot; in it was removed, or it was cooked in oil or vinegar, then they wrote that eggplant gained healthy attributes. Present-day Iranian attitudes to the eggplant reflect this medical tradition&#x27;s influence: the eggplant is &quot;considered rather dangerous... a cook in Tehran will say that the poison must be taken out&quot;. People also use eggplant seeds as an expectorant to relieve asthma and catarrh.

==Nutrition==

Raw eggplant is 92% water, 6% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and has negligible fat (table). It provides low amounts of essential nutrients, with only manganese having a moderate percentage (10%) of the Daily Value. Minor changes in nutrient composition occur with season, environment of cultivation (open field or greenhouse), and genotype.

==Cultivation and pests==
In tropical and subtropical climates, eggplant can be sown in the garden. Eggplant grown in temperate climates fares better when transplanted into the garden after all danger of frost has passed. Eggplant prefers hot weather, and when grown in cold climates or in areas with low humidity, the plants languish or fail to set and produce mature fruit. Seeds are typically started eight to 10 weeks prior to the anticipated frost-free date. &quot;S. melongena&quot; is included on a list of low flammability plants, indicating that it is suitable for growing within a building protection zone.

Spacing should be between plants, depending on cultivar, and between rows, depending on the type of cultivation equipment being used. Mulching helps conserve moisture and prevent weeds and fungal diseases and the plants benefit from some shade during the hottest part of the day. Hand pollination by shaking the flowers improves the set of the first blossoms. Growers typically cut fruits from the vine just above the calyx owing to the somewhat woody stems. Flowers are complete, containing both female and male structures, and may be self- or cross-pollinated.

Many of the pests and diseases that afflict other solanaceous plants, such as tomato, capsicum, and potato, are also troublesome to eggplants. For this reason, it should generally not be planted in areas previously occupied by its close relatives. However, since eggplants can be particularly susceptible to pests such as whiteflies, they are sometimes grown with slightly less susceptible plants, such as chili pepper, as a sacrificial trap crop. Four years should separate successive crops of eggplants to reduce pest pressure.

Common North American pests include the potato beetles, flea beetles, aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites. Good sanitation and crop rotation practices are extremely important for controlling fungal disease, the most serious of which is &quot;Verticillium&quot;.

The potato tuber moth (&quot;Phthorimaea operculella&quot;) is an oligophagous insect that prefers to feed on plants of the family Solanaceae such as eggplants. Female &quot;P. operculella&quot; use the leaves to lay their eggs and the hatched larvae will eat away at the mesophyll of the leaf.

Several different &quot;Phytoplasmas&quot; cause little leaf of brinjal, which is agriculturally significant in South Asia. This is spread by the leafhopper &quot;Hishimonus phycitis&quot;.

==Production==

In 2022, world production was 59 million tonnes, led by China with 65% and India with 22% (table).

== Chemistry ==
The color of purple skin cultivars is due to the anthocyanin nasunin.

The browning of eggplant flesh results from the oxidation of polyphenols, such as the most abundant phenolic compound in the fruit, chlorogenic acid.

==Allergies==

Case reports of itchy skin or mouth, mild headache, and stomach upset after handling or eating eggplant have been reported anecdotally and published in medical journals (see also oral allergy syndrome). A 2021 review indicated that possibly four interacting mechanisms may elicit an allergic response from consuming eggplant: lipid transfer protein, profilin, polyphenol oxidase, and pollen reactions.

A 2008 study of a sample of 741 people in India, where eggplant is commonly consumed, found nearly 10% reported some allergic symptoms after consuming eggplant, with 1.4% showing symptoms within two hours. Contact dermatitis from eggplant leaves and allergy to eggplant flower pollen have also been reported.

Individuals who are atopic (genetically predisposed to developing certain allergic hypersensitivity reactions) are more likely to have a reaction to eggplant, which may be because eggplant is high in histamines. Cooking eggplant thoroughly seems to preclude reactions in some individuals, but some of the allergenic proteins may survive the cooking process.

==Taxonomy==
The eggplant is quite often featured in the older scientific literature under the junior synonyms &quot;S. ovigerum&quot; and &quot;S. trongum&quot;. Several other names that are now invalid have been uniquely applied to it:
* &quot;Melongena ovata&quot; 
* &quot;Solanum album&quot; 
* &quot;Solanum insanum&quot; 
* &quot;Solanum longum&quot; 
* &quot;Solanum melanocarpum&quot; 
* &quot;Solanum melongenum&quot; 
* &quot;Solanum oviferum&quot; 
* &quot;Prachi&quot; 

A number of subspecies and varieties have been named, mainly by Dikii, Dunal, and (invalidly) by Sweet. Names for various eggplant types, such as , are not considered to refer to anything more than cultivar groups at best. However, &quot;Solanum incanum&quot; and cockroach berry (&quot;S. capsicoides&quot;), other eggplant-like nightshades described by Linnaeus and Allioni, respectively, were occasionally considered eggplant varieties, but this is not correct.

The eggplant has a long history of taxonomic confusion with the scarlet and Ethiopian eggplants (&quot;Solanum aethiopicum)&quot;, known as &quot;gilo&quot; and &quot;nakati&quot;, respectively, and described by Linnaeus as &quot;S. aethiopicum&quot;. The eggplant was sometimes considered a variety &quot;violaceum&quot; of that species. &quot;S. violaceum&quot; of de Candolle applies to Linnaeus&#x27; &quot;S. aethiopicum&quot;. An actual &quot;S. violaceum&quot;, an unrelated plant described by Ortega, included Dunal&#x27;s &quot;S. amblymerum&quot; and was often confused with the same author&#x27;s &quot;S. brownii&quot;.

Like the potato and &quot;S. lichtensteinii&quot;, but unlike the tomato, which then was generally put in a different genus, the eggplant was also described as &quot;S. esculentum&quot;, in this case once more in the course of Dunal&#x27;s work. He also recognized the varieties &quot;aculeatum&quot;, &quot;inerme&quot;, and &quot;subinerme&quot; at that time. Similarly, H.C.F. Schuhmacher and Peter Thonning named the eggplant as &quot;S. edule&quot;, which is also a junior synonym of sticky nightshade (&quot;S. sisymbriifolium&quot;). Scopoli&#x27;s &quot;S. zeylanicum&quot; refers to the eggplant, and that of Blanco to &quot;S. lasiocarpum&quot;.

<text>Horseradish (&quot;Armoracia rusticana&quot;, syn. &quot;Cochlearia armoracia&quot;) is a perennial plant of the family Brassicaceae (which also includes mustard, wasabi, broccoli, cabbage, and radish). It is a root vegetable, cultivated and used worldwide as a spice and as a condiment. The species is probably native to Southeastern Europe and Western Asia.

== Description ==
Horseradish grows up to tall, with hairless bright green unlobed leaves up to long that may be mistaken for docks (&quot;Rumex&quot;). It is cultivated primarily for its large, white, tapered root. The white four-petalled flowers are scented and are borne in dense panicles. Established plants may form extensive patches and may become invasive unless carefully managed.

Intact horseradish root has little aroma. When cut or grated, enzymes from within the plant cells digest sinigrin (a glucosinolate) to produce allyl isothiocyanate (mustard oil), which irritates the mucous membranes of the sinuses and eyes. Once exposed to air or heat, horseradish loses its pungency, darkens in color, and develops a bitter flavor.

==History==

Horseradish has been cultivated since antiquity. Dioscorides listed horseradish equally as &quot;Persicon sinapi&quot; (&quot;Diosc.&quot; 2.186) or &quot;Sinapi persicum&quot; (&quot;Diosc.&quot; 2.168), which Pliny&#x27;s Natural History reported as &quot;Persicon napy&quot;; Cato discusses the plant in his treatises on agriculture. A mural in Ostia Antica shows the plant. Horseradish is probably the plant mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his &quot;Natural History&quot; under the name of &quot;Amoracia&quot;, and recommended by him for its medicinal qualities, and possibly the wild radish, or &quot;raphanos agrios&quot; of the Greeks. The early Renaissance herbalists Pietro Andrea Mattioli and John Gerard showed it under &quot;Raphanus&quot;. Its modern Linnaean genus &quot;Armoracia&quot; was first applied to it by Heinrich Bernhard Ruppius, in his &quot;Flora Jenensis&quot;, 1745, but Linnaeus himself called it &quot;Cochlearia armoracia&quot;.

Both roots and leaves were used as a traditional medicine during the Middle Ages. The root was used as a condiment on meats in Germany, Scandinavia, and Britain. It was introduced to North America during European colonization; both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson mention horseradish in garden accounts. Native Americans used it to stimulate the glands, stave off scurvy, and as a diaphoretic treatment for the common cold.

William Turner mentions horseradish as &quot;Red Cole&quot; in his &quot;Herbal&quot; (1551–1568), but not as a condiment. In &quot;The Herball, or Generall Historie of Plantes&quot; (1597), John Gerard describes it under the name of &quot;raphanus rusticanus&quot;, stating that it occurs wild in several parts of England. After referring to its medicinal uses, he says:
==Etymology and common names==
The word &quot;horseradish&quot; is attested in English from the 1590s. It combines the word &quot;horse&quot; (formerly used in a figurative sense to mean strong or coarse) and the word &quot;radish&quot;. Some sources say that the term originates from a mispronunciation of the German word &quot;meerrettich&quot; as &quot;mareradish&quot;. However, this hypothesis has been disputed, as there is no historical evidence of this term being used.

In Slavic languages, the word for mustard derives from a root meaning &quot;fire&quot; or &quot;burning&quot;, often used metaphorically to refer to spicy or bitter foods. The Czech word for mustard for example is &quot;hořčice&quot;. &quot;Hořký&quot; is the adjectival form in Czech, meaning hot (spicy) or bitter. Horseradish is a plant in the mustard family. The first syllable &quot;horse&quot; in English appears to be a cognate or borrowing from the Slavic root. This likely derivation In Central and Eastern Europe may frequently be neglected since the Slavic words for horseradish &quot;chren&quot;, &quot;hren&quot; and &quot;ren&quot; (in various spellings like &quot;kren&quot;) in many Slavic languages is distinct from that for mustard referenced above. In Austria, in parts of Germany (where the other German name &quot;Meerrettich&quot; is not used), in North-East Italy, and in Yiddish (&quot;כריין&quot; transliterated as &quot;khreyn&quot;). It is common in Ukraine (under the name of , &quot;khrin&quot;), in Belarus (under the name of , &quot;chren&quot;), in Poland (under the name of ), in Czechia (), in Slovakia (), in Russia (, &quot;khren&quot;), in Hungary (), in Romania (), in Lithuania (), and in Bulgaria (under the name of ).

==Cultivation==
Horseradish is perennial in hardiness zones 2–9 and can be grown as an annual in other zones, although not as successfully as in zones with both a long growing season and winter temperatures cold enough to ensure plant dormancy. After the first frost in autumn kills the leaves, the root is dug and divided. The main root is harvested and one or more large offshoots of the main root are replanted to produce next year&#x27;s crop. Horseradish left undisturbed in the garden spreads via underground shoots and can become invasive. Older roots left in the ground become woody, after which they are no longer culinarily useful, although older plants can be dug and re-divided to start new plants. The early season leaves can be distinctively different, asymmetric spiky before the mature typical flat broad leaves start to be developed.

===Pests and diseases===
Introduced by accident, &quot;cabbageworms&quot;, the larvae of &quot;Pieris rapae&quot;, are a common caterpillar pest in horseradish. Mature caterpillars chew large, ragged holes in the leaves leaving the large veins intact. Handpicking is an effective control strategy in home gardens. Another common pest of horseradish is the mustard leaf beetle (&quot;Phaedon cochleariae&quot;). These beetles are undeterred by the defense mechanisms produced by Brassicaceae plants like horseradish.

==Production==

In the United States, horseradish is grown in several areas, such as Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and Tule Lake, California. The most concentrated growth occurs in the Collinsville, Illinois, region.

Thirty thousand metric tonnes of horseradish are produced in Europe annually, of which Hungary produces 12,000, making it the biggest single producer.

==Culinary uses==

The distinctive pungent taste of horseradish is from the compound allyl isothiocyanate. Upon crushing the flesh of horseradish, the enzyme myrosinase is released and acts on the glucosinolates sinigrin and gluconasturtiin, which are precursors to the allyl isothiocyanate. The allyl isothiocyanate serves the plant as a natural defense against herbivores. Since allyl isothiocyanate hurts the plant, it is stored in the harmless form of glucosinolate, separate from the enzyme myrosinase. When an animal chews the plant, the allyl isothiocyanate is released, repelling the animal. Allyl isothiocyanate is an unstable compound, degrading over days at . Because of this instability, horseradish sauces lack the pungency of freshly crushed roots.

Cooks may use the terms &quot;horseradish&quot; or &quot;prepared horseradish&quot; to refer to the mashed (or grated) root of the horseradish plant mixed with vinegar. Prepared horseradish is white to creamy beige. It can be stored for up to 3 months under refrigeration, but eventually will darken, indicating less flavour. The leaves of the plant are edible, either cooked or raw when young, with a flavor similar but weaker than the roots.

On Passover, many Ashkenazi Jews use grated horseradish as a choice for Maror (bitter herbs) at the Passover Seder.

===Horseradish sauce===
Horseradish sauce made from grated horseradish root and vinegar is a common condiment in the United Kingdom, in Denmark (with sugar added) and in Poland. In the UK, it is usually served with roast beef, often as part of a traditional Sunday roast, but can be used in a number of other dishes, including sandwiches or salads. A variation of horseradish sauce, which in some cases may replace the vinegar with other products like lemon juice or citric acid, is known in Germany as &quot;Tafelmeerrettich&quot;. Also available in the UK is Tewkesbury mustard, a blend of mustard and grated horseradish originating in medieval times and mentioned by Shakespeare (Falstaff says: &quot;his wit&#x27;s as thick as Tewkesbury Mustard&quot; in Henry IV Part II). A similar mustard, called &quot;Krensenf&quot; or &quot;Meerrettichsenf&quot;, is common in Austria and parts of Germany. In France, &quot;sauce au raifort&quot; is used in Alsatian cuisine. In Russia, horseradish root is usually mixed with grated garlic and a small amount of tomatoes for color (Khrenovina sauce).

In the United States, the term &quot;horseradish sauce&quot; refers to grated horseradish combined with mayonnaise or salad dressing. In Denmark, it is mixed with whipping cream and as such used on top of traditional Danish open sandwiches with beef (boiled or steaked) slices. Prepared horseradish is a common ingredient in Bloody Mary cocktails and in cocktail sauce and is used as a sauce or sandwich spread. Horseradish cream is a mixture of horseradish and sour cream and is served au jus for a prime rib dinner.

===Vegetable===

In Europe, there are two varieties of chrain. &quot;Red&quot; chrain is mixed with red beetroot and &quot;white&quot; chrain contains no beetroot. Chrain is a part of Christian Easter and Jewish Passover tradition (as &quot;maror&quot;) in Eastern and Central Europe. In the Christian tradition, horseradish is eaten during Eastertide (Paschaltide) as &quot;is a reminder of the bitterness of Jesus&#x27; suffering&quot; on Good Friday.
* In parts of Southern Germany &quot;kren&quot; is a component of the traditional wedding dinner. It is served with cooked beef and a dip made from lingonberry to balance the slight hotness of the Kren.
* In Poland, a variety with red beetroot is called or simply ćwikła.
* In Russia, a very popular ingredient for pickles (cucumbers, tomatoes, mushrooms). 
* In Ashkenazi European Jewish cooking, beetroot horseradish is commonly served with gefilte fish.
* In Transylvania and other Romanian regions, red beetroot with horseradish is used as a salad served with lamb dishes at Easter called &quot;sfecla cu hrean&quot;.
* In Serbia, &quot;ren&quot; is an essential condiment with cooked meat and freshly roasted suckling pig.
* In Croatia, freshly grated horseradish (Croatian: Hren) is often eaten with boiled ham or beef.
* In Hungary, Slovenia, and in the adjacent Italian regions of Friuli-Venezia Giulia and the nearby Italian region of Veneto, horseradish (often grated and mixed with sour cream, vinegar, hard-boiled eggs, or apples) is also a traditional Easter dish.
* In the Italian regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, and Piedmont, it is called &quot;barbaforte&quot; (strong beard) and is a traditional accompaniment to &quot;bollito misto&quot;; while in northeastern regions like Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, it is still called &quot;kren&quot; or &quot;cren&quot;. In the southern region of Basilicata it is known as &quot;rafano&quot; and used for the preparation of &quot;rafanata&quot;, a main course made of horseradish, eggs, cheese and sausage.
* Horseradish is also used as a main ingredient for soups. In Poland, horseradish soup is a common Easter Day dish.

===Relation to wasabi===
Outside Japan, the Japanese condiment wasabi, although traditionally prepared from the true wasabi plant (&quot;Wasabia japonica&quot;), is now usually made with horseradish due to the scarcity of the wasabi plant. The Japanese botanical name for horseradish is , or &quot;Western wasabi&quot;. Both plants are members of the family Brassicaceae.

==Nutritional content==
In a 100-gram amount, prepared horseradish provides 48 calories and has a high content of vitamin C with moderate content of sodium, folate and dietary fiber, while other essential nutrients are negligible in content. In a typical serving of one tablespoon (15 grams), horseradish supplies no significant nutrient content.

Horseradish contains volatile oils, notably mustard oil.

==Biomedical uses==
The enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP), found in the plant, is used extensively in molecular biology and biochemistry primarily for its ability to amplify a weak signal and increase the detectability of a target molecule. HRP has been used in decades of research to visualize under microscopy and assess non-quantitatively the permeability of capillaries, particularly those of the brain.

<text>The Arecaceae () is a family of perennial, flowering plants in the monocot order Arecales. Their growth form can be climbers, shrubs, tree-like and stemless plants, all commonly known as palms. Those having a tree-like form are colloquially called palm trees. Currently, 181 genera with around 2,600 species are known, most of which are restricted to tropical and subtropical climates. Most palms are distinguished by their large, compound, evergreen leaves, known as fronds, arranged at the top of an unbranched stem, except for the Hyphaene genus, who has branched palms. However, palms exhibit an enormous diversity in physical characteristics and inhabit nearly every type of habitat within their range, from rainforests to deserts.

Palms are among the best known and most extensively cultivated plant families. They have been important to humans throughout much of history, especially in regions like the Middle East and North Africa. A wide range of common products and foods are derived from palms. In contemporary times, palms are also widely used in landscaping. In many historical cultures, because of their importance as food, palms were symbols for such ideas as victory, peace, and fertility.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Arecaceae&quot; is derived from the word &quot;areca&quot; with the suffix &quot;-aceae&quot;. &quot;Areca&quot; is derived from Portuguese, via Malayalam അടയ്ക്ക (&quot;aṭaykka&quot;), which is from Dravidian &quot;*aṭ-ay-kkāy&quot; (&quot;areca nut&quot;). The suffix &quot;-aceae&quot; is the feminine plural of the Latin &quot;-āceus&quot; (&quot;resembling&quot;).

&quot;Palm&quot; originates from Latin &quot;palma&quot; semantically overlapping with sense of &quot;hand front&quot; (due to similar splayed shape) ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;pl̥h₂meh₂&quot;, a direct descendant once existed in Old English.

==Morphology==
Whether as shrubs, tree-like, or vines, palms have two methods of growth: solitary or clustered. The common representation is that of a solitary shoot ending in a crown of leaves. This monopodial character may be exhibited by prostrate, trunkless, and trunk-forming members. Some common palms restricted to solitary growth include &quot;Washingtonia&quot; and &quot;Roystonea&quot;. Palms may instead grow in sparse though dense clusters. The trunk develops an axillary bud at a leaf node, usually near the base, from which a new shoot emerges. The new shoot, in turn, produces an axillary bud and a clustering habit results. Exclusively sympodial genera include many of the rattans, &quot;Guihaia&quot;, and &quot;Rhapis&quot;. Several palm genera have both solitary and clustering members. Palms which are usually solitary may grow in clusters and vice versa.

Palms have large, evergreen leaves that are either palmately (&#x27;fan-leaved&#x27;) or pinnately (&#x27;feather-leaved&#x27;) compound and spirally (-alternately) arranged at the top of the stem, with the sole exception of the King Raphia (Raphia vinifera &quot;variety&quot; nigerica) which has opposite pairs of fronds). The leaves have a tubular sheath at the base that usually splits open on one side at maturity. The inflorescence is a spadix or spike surrounded by one or more bracts or spathes that become woody at maturity. The flowers are generally small and white, radially symmetric, and can be either uni- or bisexual. The sepals and petals usually number three each and may be distinct or joined at the base. The stamens generally number six, with filaments that may be separate, attached to each other, or attached to the pistil at the base. The fruit is usually a single-seeded drupe (sometimes berry-like) but some genera (e.g., &quot;Salacca&quot;) may contain two or more seeds in each fruit.

Like all monocots, palms do not have the ability to increase the width of a stem (secondary growth) via the same kind of vascular cambium found in non-monocot woody plants. This explains the cylindrical shape of the trunk (almost constant diameter) that is often seen in palms, unlike in ring-forming trees. However, many palms, like some other monocots, do have secondary growth, although because it does not arise from a single vascular cambium producing xylem inwards and phloem outwards, it is often called &quot;anomalous secondary growth&quot;.

The Arecaceae are notable among monocots for their height and for the size of their seeds, leaves, and inflorescences. &quot;Ceroxylon quindiuense&quot;, Colombia&#x27;s national &quot;tree&quot;, is the tallest monocot in the world, reaching up to tall. The &quot;coco de mer&quot; (&quot;Lodoicea maldivica&quot;) has the largest seeds of any plant, in diameter and weighing each (coconuts are the second largest). Raffia palms (&quot;Raphia&quot; spp.) have the largest leaves of any plant, up to long and wide. The &quot;Corypha&quot; species have the largest inflorescence of any plant, up to tall and containing millions of small flowers. &quot;Calamus&quot; stems can reach in length.

==Range and habitat==

Most palms are native to tropical and subtropical climates. Palms thrive in moist and hot climates but can be found in a variety of different habitats. Their diversity is highest in wet, lowland forests. South America, the Caribbean, and areas of the South Pacific and southern Asia are regions of concentration. Colombia may have the highest number of palm species in one country. There are some palms that are also native to desert areas such as the Arabian Peninsula and parts of northwestern Mexico. Only about 130 palm species naturally grow entirely beyond the tropics, mostly in humid lowland subtropical climates, in highlands in southern Asia, and along the rim lands of the Mediterranean Sea. The northernmost native palm is &quot;Chamaerops humilis&quot;, which reaches 44°N latitude along the coast of Liguria, Italy. In the southern hemisphere, the southernmost palm is the &quot;Rhopalostylis sapida&quot;, which reaches 44°S on the Chatham Islands where an oceanic climate prevails. Cultivation of palms is possible north of subtropical climates, and some higher latitude locales such as Ireland, Scotland, England, and the Pacific Northwest feature a few palms in protected locations and microclimates. In the United States, there are at least 12 native palm species, mostly occurring in the states of the Deep South and Florida.

Palms inhabit a variety of ecosystems. More than two-thirds of palm species live in humid moist forests, where some species grow tall enough to form part of the canopy and shorter ones form part of the understory. Some species form pure stands in areas with poor drainage or regular flooding, including &quot;Raphia hookeri&quot; which is common in coastal freshwater swamps in West Africa. Other palms live in tropical mountain habitats above , such as those in the genus &quot;Ceroxylon&quot; native to the Andes. Palms may also live in grasslands and scrublands, usually associated with a water source, and in desert oases such as the date palm. A few palms are adapted to extremely basic lime soils, while others are similarly adapted to extreme potassium deficiency and toxicity of heavy metals in serpentine soils.

==Taxonomy==

Palms are a monophyletic group of plants, meaning the group consists of a common ancestor and all its descendants. Extensive taxonomic research on palms began with botanist H.E. Moore, who organized palms into 15 major groups based mostly on general morphological characteristics. The following classification, proposed by N.W. Uhl and J. Dransfield in 1987, is a revision of Moore&#x27;s classification that organizes palms into 6 subfamilies. A few general traits of each subfamily are listed below.
* Subfamily are the largest subfamily with 14 tribes and containing over 100 genera. All tribes have pinnate or bipinnate leaves and flowers arranged in groups of three, with a central pistillate and two staminate flowers.
* Subfamily includes the climbing palms, such as rattans. The leaves are usually pinnate; derived characters (synapomorphies) include spines on various organs, organs specialized for climbing, an extension of the main stem of the leaf-bearing reflexed spines, and overlapping scales covering the fruit and ovary.
* Subfamily has small to medium-sized flowers, spirally arranged, with a gynoecium of three joined carpels.
* Subfamily are the second-largest subfamily with 8 tribes. Most palms in this subfamily have palmately lobed leaves and solitary flowers with three, or sometimes four carpels. The fruit normally develops from only one carpel.
* Subfamily contains only one species, &quot;Nypa fruticans&quot;, which has large, pinnate leaves. The fruit is unusual in that it floats, and the stem is underground and dichotomously branched, also unusual in palms.

The is the sixth subfamily of Arecaceae in N.W. Uhl and J. Dransfield&#x27;s 1987 classification. Members of this group have distinct monopodial flower clusters. Other distinct features include a gynoecium with five to 10 joined carpels, and flowers with more than three parts per whorl. Fruits are multiple-seeded and have multiple parts. From the modern phylogenomic data, the Phytelephantoideae are tribe in the Ceroxyloideae subfamily.

Currently, few extensive phylogenetic studies of the Arecaceae exist. In 1997, Baker &quot;et al.&quot; explored subfamily and tribe relationships using chloroplast DNA from 60 genera from all subfamilies and tribes. The results strongly showed the Calamoideae are monophyletic, and Ceroxyloideae and Coryphoideae are paraphyletic. The relationships of Arecoideae are uncertain, but they are possibly related to the Ceroxyloideae and Phytelephantoideae. Studies have suggested the lack of a fully resolved hypothesis for the relationships within the family is due to a variety of factors, including difficulties in selecting appropriate outgroups, homoplasy in morphological character states, slow rates of molecular evolution important for the use of standard DNA markers, and character polarization. However, hybridization has been observed among &quot;Orbignya&quot; and &quot;Phoenix&quot; species, and using chloroplast DNA in cladistic studies may produce inaccurate results due to maternal inheritance of the chloroplast DNA. Chemical and molecular data from non-organelle DNA, for example, could be more effective for studying palm phylogeny.

Recently, nuclear genomes and transcriptomes have been used to reconstruct the phylogeny of palms. This has revealed, for example, that a whole-genome duplication event occurred early in the evolution of the Arecaceae lineage, that was not experienced by its sister clade, the Dasypogonaceae.

For a phylogenetic tree of the family, see the list of Arecaceae genera.

==Evolution==

The Arecaceae were the first modern family of monocots to appear in the fossil record around 80 million years ago (Mya), during the late Cretaceous period. The first modern species, such as &quot;Nypa fruticans&quot; and &quot;Acrocomia aculeata&quot;, appeared 69 Mya, as evidenced by fossil &quot;Nypa&quot; pollen. Palms appear to have undergone an early period of adaptive radiation. By 60 Mya, many of the modern, specialized genera of palms appeared and became widespread and common, much more widespread than their range today. Because palms separated from the monocots earlier than other families, they developed more intrafamilial specialization and diversity. By tracing back these diverse characteristics of palms to the basic structures of monocots, palms may be valuable in studying monocot evolution. Several species of palms have been identified from flowers preserved in amber, including &quot;Palaeoraphe dominicana&quot; and &quot;Roystonea palaea&quot;. Fossil evidence of them can also be found in samples of petrified palmwood.

The relationship between the subfamilies is shown in the following cladogram:
==Uses==
Evidence for cultivation of the date palm by Mesopotamians and other Middle Eastern peoples exists from more than 5,000 years ago, in the form of date wood, pits for storing dates, and other remains of the date palm in Mesopotamian sites. The date palm had a significant effect on the history of the Middle East and North Africa. In the text &quot;Date Palm Products&quot; (1993), W.H. Barreveld wrote:

An indication of the importance of palms in ancient times is that they are mentioned more than 30 times in the Bible, and at least 22 times in the Quran. The Torah also references the &quot;70 date palm trees&quot;, which symbolize the 70 aspects of Torah that are revealed to those who &quot;eat of its fruit.&quot;

Arecaceae have great economic importance, including coconut products, oils, dates, palm syrup, ivory nuts, carnauba wax, rattan cane, raffia, and palm wood. This family supplies a large amount of the human diet and several other human uses, both by absolute amount produced and by number of species domesticated. This is far higher than almost any other plant family, sixth out of domesticated crops in the human diet, and first in total economic value produced sharing the top spot with the Poaceae and Fabaceae. These human uses have also spread many Arecaceae species around the world.

Along with dates mentioned above, members of the palm family with human uses are numerous:
* The type member of Arecaceae is the areca palm (&quot;Areca catechu&quot;), the fruit of which, the areca nut, is chewed with the betel leaf for intoxicating effects.
* Carnauba wax is harvested from the leaves of South American palms of the genus &quot;Copernicia&quot;.
* Rattans, whose stems are used extensively in furniture and baskets, are in the genus &quot;Calamus&quot;.
* Palm oil is an edible vegetable oil produced by the oil palms in the genus &quot;Elaeis&quot;.
* Several species are harvested for heart of palm, a vegetable eaten in salads.
* Sap of the nipa palm, &quot;Nypa fruticans&quot;, is used to make vinegar.
* Palm sap is sometimes fermented to produce palm wine or toddy, an alcoholic beverage common in parts of Africa, India, and the Philippines. The sap may be drunk fresh, but fermentation is rapid, reaching up to 4% alcohol content within an hour, and turning vinegary in a day.
* Palmyra and date palm sap is harvested in Bengal, India, to process into &quot;gur&quot; and &quot;jaggery&quot;.
* Coconut is the partially edible seed of the fruit of the coconut palm (&quot;Cocos nucifera&quot;).
* Coir is a coarse, water-resistant fiber extracted from the outer shell of coconuts, used in doormats, brushes, mattresses, and ropes.
* Some indigenous groups living in palm-rich areas use palms to make many of their necessary items and food. Sago, for example, a starch made from the pith of the trunk of the sago palm &quot;Metroxylon sagu&quot;, is a major staple food for lowland peoples of New Guinea and the Moluccas.
* Palm wine is made from &quot;Jubaea&quot; also called Chilean wine palm, or coquito palm.
* Recently, the fruit of the açaí palm &quot;Euterpe&quot; has been used for its reputed health benefits.
* Saw palmetto (&quot;Serenoa repens&quot;) is being investigated as a drug for treating enlarged prostates.
* Palm leaves are also valuable to some peoples as a material for thatching, basketry, clothing, and in religious ceremonies (see &quot;Symbolism&quot; below).
* Ornamental uses: Today, palms are valuable as ornamental plants and are often grown along streets in tropical and subtropical cities. &quot;Chamaedorea elegans&quot; is a popular houseplant and is grown indoors for its low maintenance. Farther north, palms are a common feature in botanical gardens or as indoor plants. Few palms tolerate severe cold and the majority of the species are tropical or subtropical. The three most cold-tolerant species are &quot;Trachycarpus fortunei&quot;, native to eastern Asia, and &quot;Rhapidophyllum hystrix&quot; and &quot;Sabal minor&quot;, both native to the southeastern United States.
* The southeastern U.S. state of South Carolina is nicknamed the Palmetto State after the sabal palmetto (cabbage palmetto), logs from which were used to build the fort at Fort Moultrie. During the American Revolutionary War, they were invaluable to those defending the fort, because their spongy wood absorbed or deflected the British cannonballs.
* Singaporean politician Tan Cheng Bock uses a palm tree-like symbol similar to a &quot;Ravenala&quot; to represent him in the 2011 Singaporean presidential election. The symbol of a party he founded, Progress Singapore Party, was also based on a palm tree.
* On Ash Wednesday, Catholics receive a cross on their forehead made of palm ashes as a reminder of the Catholic belief that everyone and everything eventually returns to where it came from, commonly expressed by the saying &quot;ashes to ashes and dust to dust.&quot;
* Lately the Fujairah Research Centre reported the use of date palm leaves to help restore coral reefs as it merged ancient Emerati techniques with modern science.

==Endangered species==
Like many other plants, palms have been threatened by human intervention and exploitation. The greatest risk to palms is destruction of habitat, especially in the tropical forests, due to urbanization, wood-chipping, mining, and conversion to farmland. Palms rarely reproduce after such great changes in the habitat, and those with small habitat ranges are most vulnerable to them. The harvesting of heart of palm, a delicacy in salads, also poses a threat because it is derived from the palm&#x27;s apical meristem, a vital part of the palm that cannot be regrown (except in domesticated varieties, e.g. of peach palm). The use of rattan palms in furniture has caused a major population decrease in these species that has negatively affected local and international markets, as well as biodiversity in the area. The sale of seeds to nurseries and collectors is another threat, as the seeds of popular palms are sometimes harvested directly from the wild. In 2006, at least 100 palm species were considered endangered, and nine species have been reported as recently extinct.

However, several factors make palm conservation more difficult. Palms live in almost every type of warm habitat and have tremendous morphological diversity. Most palm seeds lose viability quickly, and they cannot be preserved in low temperatures because the cold kills the embryo. Using botanical gardens for conservation also presents problems, since they can rarely house more than a few plants of any species or truly imitate the natural setting. There is also the risk that cross-pollination can lead to hybrid species.

The Palm Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) began in 1984, and has performed a series of three studies to find basic information on the status of palms in the wild, use of wild palms, and palms under cultivation. Two projects on palm conservation and use supported by the World Wildlife Fund took place from 1985 to 1990 and 1986–1991, in the American tropics and southeast Asia, respectively. Both studies produced copious new data and publications on palms. Preparation of a global action plan for palm conservation began in 1991, supported by the IUCN, and was published in 1996.

The rarest palm known is &quot;Hyophorbe amaricaulis&quot;. The only living individual remains at the Botanic Gardens of Curepipe in Mauritius.

==Arthropod pests==
Some pests are specialists to particular taxa. Pests that attack a &quot;variety&quot; of species of palms include:
* &quot;Raoiella indica&quot;, the red palm mite
* &quot;Caryobruchus gleditsiae&quot;, the palm seed beetle or palm seed weevil
* &quot;Rhynchophorus ferrugineus&quot;, the red palm weevil, recently introduced to Europe
* &quot;Rhynchophorus palmarum&quot;, the South American palm weevil

==Symbolism==

The palm branch was a symbol of triumph and victory in classical antiquity. The Romans rewarded champions of the games and celebrated military successes with palm branches. Early Christians used the palm branch to symbolize the victory of the faithful over enemies of the soul, as in the Palm Sunday festival celebrating the triumphal entry of Jesus Christ into Jerusalem. In Judaism, the palm represents peace and plenty, and is one of the Four Species of Sukkot; the palm may also symbolize the Tree of Life in Kabbalah.

The canopies of the Rathayatra carts which carry the deities of Krishna and his family members in the cart festival of Jagganath Puri in India are marked with the emblem of a palm tree. Specifically it is the symbol of Krishna&#x27;s brother, Baladeva.

In 1840, the American geologist Edward Hitchcock (1793–1864) published the first tree-like paleontology chart in his &quot;Elementary Geology&quot;, with two separate trees of life for the plants and the animals. These are crowned (graphically) with the Palms and with Man.

Today, the palm, especially the coconut palm, remains a symbol of the tropical island paradise.
Palms appear on the flags and seals of several places where they are native, including those of Haiti, Guam, Saudi Arabia, Florida, and South Carolina.

<text>A transporter is a fictional teleportation machine used in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. Transporters allow for teleportation by converting a person or object into an energy pattern (a process called &quot;dematerialization&quot;), then sending (&quot;beaming&quot;) it to a target location or else returning it to the transporter, where it is reconverted into matter (&quot;rematerialization&quot;). The command often used to request activation of the transporter is &quot;Energize.&quot; 

Introduced in &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; in 1966, the transporter had predecessors in teleportation devices in other science fiction stories, such as the 1939 serial &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;. The name and similar concepts have made their way to later science fiction scenarios, in literature (such as the &quot;Thousand Cultures&quot; series), games (&quot;SimEarth&quot;), etc.

The transporter was originally conceived as a device to convey characters from a starship to the surface of a planet without the need for expensive and time-consuming special effects to depict the starship or another craft physically landing. Malfunctioning transporters are also often used as a plot device to set up a variety of science fiction premises. The transporter has become a hallmark of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise; the famous catchphrase &quot;Beam me up, Scotty&quot; (a misquote) refers to the use of the transporter on &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, operated by the character Montgomery Scott, presumably at the request of Captain Kirk. Transporter technology has been used in many subsequent &quot;Star Trek&quot; series.

==Design==
On &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, the transporter was portrayed as a platform on which characters stand before being engulfed by a beam of light and transported to their destination. The transporter&#x27;s special effect was originally created by turning a slow-motion camera upside down and photographing some backlit shiny grains of aluminium powder that were dropped between the camera and a black background; later series would eventually use computer animation for the effect. On &quot;The Original Series&quot;, the transporter operator would activate the device by moving three sliders on a console. In the sequel series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, the sliders were replaced with three touch-sensitive light-up bars, which according to the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual&quot; were designed as a homage to the original sliders.

==Narrative function==
Creator Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s original plan did not include transporters, instead calling for characters to land the starship itself. However, this would have required unfeasible and unaffordable (for the 1960s) sets and model filming, as well as episode running time spent while landing, taking off, etc. The shuttlecraft was the next idea, but when filming began, the full-sized shooting model was not ready. Transporters were devised as a less expensive alternative, achieved by a simple fade-out/fade-in of the subject. Transporters first appear in the original pilot episode &quot;The Cage&quot;.

===Transporter accidents===
Many episodes of &quot;Star Trek&quot; series feature transporter accidents as a plot device: a malfunctioning transporter fails to rematerialize a person or object properly in some bizarre way that creates a science-fictional problem or ethical dilemma that characters must resolve. In various episodes, transporter accidents have been used to send characters to a parallel universe, or back in time; to split a character into two distinct individuals, or merge two characters into a single individual; and to regress adult characters to children, among a variety of other effects.

==Portrayal==
===Fictional history===
According to dialogue in the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; (&quot;ENT&quot;) episode &quot;Daedalus&quot;, the transporter was invented in the early 22nd century by Dr. Emory Erickson, who also became the first human to be successfully transported. Although the &quot;Enterprise&quot; (NX-01) has a transporter, the crew does not routinely use it for moving biological organisms. Instead, they generally prefer using shuttlepods or other means of transportation unless no other means of transportation are possible or feasible. The capability is rare; in &quot;The Andorian Incident&quot;, the Andorians, technologically far superior to Starfleet in many regards, are explicitly stated not to possess the technology. In &quot;Chosen Realm&quot;, a group of alien religious extremists who hijack the ship is unaware of it to the point that when Archer insists on sacrificing a crew member and claims that the device disintegrates matter rather than teleporting it, he is unhesitatingly taken at his word. The crew aboard the 23rd century USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; frequently use the transporter. By the 24th century, transporter travel was reliable and &quot;the safest way to travel&quot; according to dialogue in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (&quot;TNG&quot;) episode &quot;Realm of Fear&quot;.

According to the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Homefront&quot;, Starfleet Academy cadets receive transporter rations, and the Sisko family once used a transporter to move furniture into a new home.

Despite its frequent use, characters such as Leonard McCoy and Katherine Pulaski are reluctant to use the transporter, as the characters express in the &quot;Next Generation&quot; episodes &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; and &quot;Unnatural Selection&quot;, respectively. Reginald Barclay expresses his outright fear of transporting in &quot;Realm of Fear&quot;.

===Capabilities and limitations===
The television series and films do not go into great detail about transporter technology. The &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual&quot; claims that the devices transport objects in real time, accurate to the quantum level. The episode &quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; specifies the length of a transport under unusual circumstances would last &quot;... four or five seconds; about twice the normal time&quot; (making the length of a typical transport between 2 and 2.5 seconds). Heisenberg compensators remove uncertainty from the subatomic measurements, making transporter travel feasible. Further technology involved in transportation include a computer pattern buffer to enable a degree of leeway in the process. When asked &quot;How does the Heisenberg compensator work?&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;Star Trek&quot; technical adviser Michael Okuda responded: &quot;It works very well, thank you.&quot;

According to &quot;The Original Series&quot; (&quot;TOS&quot;) writers&#x27; guide, the effective range of a transporter is 40,000 kilometers. The &quot;TOS&quot; episode &quot;Obsession&quot; however, appears to indicate that the transporters&#x27; maximum range, during that time period in &quot;Star Trek&quot; history, is actually around 30,000 kilometers. Transporter operations have been disrupted or prevented by dense metals (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;Contagion&quot;), solar flares (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;Symbiosis&quot;), and other forms of radiation, including electromagnetic (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;The Enemy&quot;; &quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;Power Play&quot;) and nucleonic (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;Schisms&quot;), and affected by ion storms (&quot;TOS&quot;: &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;). Transporting, in progress, has also been stopped by telekinetic powers (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;Skin of Evil&quot;) and by brute strength (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;The Hunted&quot;). The &quot;TNG&quot; episode &quot;Bloodlines&quot; features a dangerous and experimental &quot;subspace transporter&quot; capable of interstellar distances and the Dominion had the ability to transport over great distances (&quot;DS9&quot;: &quot;Covenant&quot;). The 40,000-kilometer limit is also referred to in &quot;ENT&quot;: &quot;Daedalus&quot;. It was established in &quot;TOS&quot; episode &quot;Arena&quot; that the transporter cannot be used when the ship&#x27;s deflector shields are up.

Starfleet transporters from the &quot;TNG&quot; era onward include a device that can detect and disable an active weapon (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;The Most Toys&quot;), and a bio-filter to remove contagious microbes or viruses from an individual in transport (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot;, &quot;TOS&quot;: &quot;The Naked Time&quot;). The transporter can also serve a tactical purpose, such as beaming a photon grenade or photon torpedo to detonate at remote locations (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;Legacy&quot;, &quot;&quot;: &quot;Dark Frontier&quot;), or to outright destroy objects (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;Captain&#x27;s Holiday&quot;). The &quot;TOS&quot; episode &quot;A Taste of Armageddon&quot; mentions Vendikar materializing fusion bombs over targets of enemy planet Eminiar VII in the course of theoretical computer warfare.

Klingon transporters, as seen in &quot;Star Trek III&quot;, have a harsh red light in contrast to Federation blue, and operate with complete silence (in the movie, no sound effects). Presumably this is to enhance the combat effectiveness of Klingon boarding parties. It is not made clear whether Klingon transporters are more risky for the boarders, but the warlike Klingons are likely not to be concerned about transport casualties in combat.

Whenever a person or object is transported, the machine creates a memory file of the pattern. This has been used at least once in every &quot;Star Trek&quot; series to revert people adversely affected by a transport to their original state.

Various episodes of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; (&quot;DS9&quot;) and &quot;Voyager&quot; (&quot;VOY&quot;) have introduced two anti-transporter devices: transport inhibitors and transporter scramblers. Inhibitors prevent a transporter beam from &quot;locking on&quot; to whatever the device is attached to. Scramblers distort the pattern that is in transit, literally scrambling the atoms upon rematerialization, resulting in the destruction of inanimate objects and killing living beings by rematerializing them as masses of random tissue; this was gruesomely demonstrated in the &quot;DS9&quot; episode &quot;The Darkness and the Light&quot;.

Transporter operations can also be curtailed when either the point of origin and/or the intended target site is moving at warp velocities. In the &quot;TNG&quot; episode &quot;The Schizoid Man&quot;, a &quot;long-range&quot; or &quot;near-warp&quot; transport was required as a transporter beam cannot penetrate a warp field. (In the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; film Kirk and Scotty beam aboard while the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is traveling at warp, however, the movie takes place in an alternate continuity, thus not affecting the Prime Continuity used in all previous media and the &quot;Star Trek&quot; Online computer game.) To deposit an away team on the planet Gravesworld while at the same time responding to a distress signal, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; would only drop out of warp drive just long enough to energize the transporter beam. Geordi La Forge personally performed the delicate operation, which involved compensating for the ship&#x27;s relativistic motion. After materializing, Deanna Troi commented that for a moment she thought she was trapped in a nearby wall, to which Worf replied, &quot;For a moment, you were&quot;. In later stories (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;The Emissary&quot; and &quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot;), it was confirmed that the transporter would work at warp only if the sending and receiving sites were moving at equal velocities.

In his book &quot;The Physics of Star Trek&quot;, after explaining the difference between transporting information and transporting the actual atoms, Krauss notes that &quot;The &quot;Star Trek&quot; writers seem never to have got it exactly clear what they want the transporter to do. Does the transporter send the atoms and the bits, or just the bits?&quot; He notes that according to the canon definition of the transporter the former seems to be the case, but that that definition is inconsistent with a number of applications, particularly incidents, involving the transporter, which appear to involve only a transport of information, for example the way in which it splits Kirk into two versions in the episode &quot;The Enemy Within&quot; or the way in which Riker is similarly split in the episode &quot;Second Chances&quot;. Krauss elaborates that: &quot;If the transporter carries both the matter stream and the information signal, this splitting phenomenon is impossible. The number of atoms you end up with has to be the same as the number you began with. There is no possible way to replicate people in this manner. On the other hand, if only the information were beamed up, one could imagine combining it with atoms that might be stored aboard a starship and making as many copies as wanted of an individual.&quot;

===Reliability===
Aside from external influences causing disruptions in the normal operations of transporters, the technology itself has been known to fail on occasion, causing serious injury or usually death to those being transported. This was demonstrated in Star Trek&#x27;s 1979 film debut, &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; when a malfunction in the transporter sensor circuits resulted in insufficient signal being present at the &quot;Enterprise&quot; end to successfully rematerialize the two subjects, and Starfleet was unable to pull them back to where they had dematerialized from. The transporter system attempted to rematerialize what little signal was available, and despite the efforts of Kirk and Scotty, the system failed and both subjects vanished from the transporter pad and back to Starfleet, where both subjects died from radiation and disfiguration. Kirk, visibly shaken by what he had witnessed asked, &quot;Starfleet, do you have them?&quot;, to which the response was made &quot;&quot;Enterprise&quot;, what we got back didn&#x27;t live long, fortunately&quot;.

By the time of &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, transporter technology has advanced considerably, meaning that accidents are now remote, if not near impossible. In the episode &quot;Realm of Fear&quot;, Geordi La Forge states that there have been no more than two or three transporter accidents in the preceding ten years. Reference is also made to the advancement of transporter technology in the same episode, where Chief O&#x27;Brien states that each individual transporter pad has four redundant scanners whereby in the event a scanner fails the other three will take over, and that he has never lost anyone having been a transporter operator for over 20 years.

In &quot;Rascals&quot;, four adult &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew members were beamed off a shuttle and rematerialized as children still in their adult-sized clothing. The incoming &quot;matter stream&quot; had a commensurate drop in mass; the operator had initially thought the reduction in mass meant &quot;we may have lost one&quot;.

In the &quot;Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Tuvix&quot;, a transporter accident combines both the physical and behavioral aspects of Lt. Tuvok and Neelix into a single being wearing a melange of each other&#x27;s clothing. Notably, Tuvix was of equal mass of both Tuvok and Neelix combined. When they were later separated, Neelix and Tuvok were both wearing Starfleet uniforms.

===Technological and scientific restrictions===
While several characters have asserted that transporters cannot transport through a ship&#x27;s shields or planetary defense shields, there are instances of this &quot;rule&quot; being broken through a technobabble solution (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;The Wounded&quot;, &quot;DS9&quot;: &quot;Trials and Tribble-ations&quot;) or disregarded by the show&#x27;s writers (&quot;Voyager&quot;: &quot;Caretaker&quot;). The non-canon &quot;TNG Technical Manual&quot; describes how a starship may create &quot;windows&quot; in the shield geometry through which a transporter beam may propagate at the expense of creating weak spots in the vessel&#x27;s defensive field.

In &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, Vice Admiral James T. Kirk and Lieutenant Saavik carry on a conversation during rematerialization. In &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;, Dr. Gillian Taylor jumps into Kirk&#x27;s transporter beam during dematerialization, and rematerializes without any apparent ill effects. This is probably due to the &quot;annular confinement beam&quot;, a component of the transporter mentioned in the various television episodes which serves to keep patterns separate from one another. In the same film, Mr. Spock is beamed onto a cloaked ship while walking.

According to the &quot;TNG Technical Manual&quot;, the transporter cannot move antimatter, but in the &quot;Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Dark Frontier&quot; &quot;Voyager&quot; transported a live photon torpedo equipped with antimatter onto a Borg ship. Also in &quot;TOS&quot; episode &quot;Obsession&quot; Kirk and a fellow crewman beam down to the surface of a planet with an antimatter bomb. The &quot;TAS&quot; episode &quot;One of Our Planets Is Missing&quot; has the &quot;Enterprise&quot; beaming a chunk of antimatter into a stasis box.

In the original series, beaming to and from the transporter chamber was a necessity. This is explained in the &quot;TOS&quot; episode &quot;Day of the Dove&quot;. Spock and Scotty had said that doing a site-to-site transport, as they are referred to on the show, on board the ship could be risky. They could beam into a deck or other inanimate object and get stuck there. However, there are apparently safeguards in place to prevent people from being beamed into hostile environments such as under water and into lava pits, although it is possible to override this safety feature; for example, in the &quot;TOS&quot; episode &quot;And the Children Shall Lead&quot;, two security guards are beamed into open space. In the following series, however, the transporter room seems to become mostly obsolete, the actual equipment notwithstanding. Characters are shown activating the transporter from ordinary consoles and beaming from place to place without apparent trouble. The main operator can likewise send those in transport anywhere with ease (for example, in the &quot;Voyager&quot; episode &quot;In the Flesh&quot;, a medical console is used to transport a body from the morgue to the surgical bay). A possible explanation for this is put forward in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual&quot;, where such site-to-site transports would probably use twice as much energy as would be required for transport to or from the transporter room itself, since the subject would have to be beamed to the transporter, stored, then shunted to their destination. In addition, the six circles on the platform are generally used as targets for the subjects to stand on, but they do not appear to represent any limitation of the hardware to six or fewer people. People have been transported carrying others, in a coffin style transport, as well as animals, hay, and various inanimate objects.

Dialogue in &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; indicates the existence of portable transporters, but these are never seen. The &quot;Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Timescape&quot; features emergency transporter armbands, although these may have served only to activate a remote transporter. To confuse things more, &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; featured the prototype &quot;emergency transport unit&quot;. Tom Paris uses a portable transporter in the &quot;Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Non Sequitur&quot;. 
For special effects reasons, in &quot;TOS&quot;, people generally appear immobilized during transport, with the exception of Kirk in the episode &quot;That Which Survives&quot;. However, by &quot;TNG&quot;, characters can move within the confines of the transporter beam while being transported, although this is rarely shown. Persons being transported are at least sometimes able to perceive the functioning of the transporter while they are in transit. In the &quot;TOS&quot; episode &quot;The Doomsday Machine&quot;, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; transporter malfunctions while transporting Scotty from the disabled USS &quot;Constellation&quot; to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; due to a power drain, and Scotty&#x27;s pattern is nearly lost in transit. As soon as he successfully materializes, Scotty asks the transporter operator with concern, &quot;What&#x27;s the matter with that thing?&quot; and orders the transporter to be taken offline for emergency repair.

Some species do not use transporter technology for a variety of reasons. In the first appearance of Trill in the &quot;TNG&quot; episode &quot;The Host&quot;, Trill were unable to be transported, once joined with a symbiont. It seems that was due to the symbiont being detected and removed by the transporter technology as an infestation in the host. Odan, the Trill host in this episode, is reluctant to say why he will not travel this way, and it only becomes apparent that he is carrying a symbiont when he is later injured. All the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; react as if they have had no contact with this species before. It later becomes apparent that joined Trill have been working in the Federation for some time.

In season three of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, set in the 32nd century, personal transporters are used.

==&quot;Beam me up, Scotty&quot;==
The famous catchphrase &quot;Beam me up, Scotty&quot; refers to the use of the transporter device to recall a crewmember to the ship; the device was often operated by chief engineer Montgomery Scott during &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;. However, it is a slight misquote that was never uttered verbatim on the show.

The closest actual phrase, &quot;Scotty, beam me up&quot;, was spoken by Admiral Kirk in &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; (1986). On the special edition DVD of &quot;Star Trek IV&quot;, the text commentary provided by Michael and Denise Okuda (co-authors of &quot;The Star Trek Encyclopedia&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Star Trek Chronology: The History of the Future&quot;) indicates that this was the closest anyone came to using that catchphrase in an official &quot;Star Trek&quot; production.

==Real-world feasibility==

In August 2008, physicist Michio Kaku predicted in &quot;Discovery Channel Magazine&quot; that a teleportation device similar to those in &quot;Star Trek&quot; would be invented within 100 years. Physics students at University of Leicester calculated that to &quot;beam up&quot; just the genetic information of a single human cell (not the positions of the atoms, just the gene sequences) together with a &quot;brain state&quot; would take 4,850 trillion years assuming a 30 gigahertz microwave bandwidth. A study by Eric Davis for the US Air Force Research Laboratory of speculative teleportation technologies showed that to dematerialize a human body by heating it up to a million times the temperature of the core of the sun so that the quarks lose their binding energy and become massless and can be beamed at the speed of light in the closest physics equivalent to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; teleportation scenario would require the equivalent of 330 megatons of energy. To meet the information storage and transmission requirements would require current computing capabilities to continue to improve by a factor of 10 to 100 times per decade for 200 to 300 years.

<text>Schleswig (, , ; ; South Jutlandic: &quot;Sljasvig&quot;; ) is a town in the northeastern part of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is the capital of the &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) Schleswig-Flensburg. It has a population of about 27,000, the main industries being leather and food processing. It takes its name from the Schlei (Slien), an inlet of the Baltic Sea at the end of which it sits, and &quot;vik&quot; or &quot;vig&quot; which means &quot;bay&quot; in Old Norse and Danish. Schleswig or Slesvig therefore means &quot;bay of the Schlei&quot;.

The Viking settlement of Hedeby, located south of the modern town, was first mentioned in 804. It was a powerful settlement in the Baltic region, dominating the area for more than 200 years. In 1050, following several destructions, the population was moved to the opposite shore of the Schlei, becoming the city of Schleswig. In 1066 Hedeby was finally destroyed, and Schleswig remained a part of the Danish kingdom.

In 1544, Gottorf Castle became the residence of the local rulers. The dukes of Gottorf were vassals of the Danish kings and ruled over much of present-day Schleswig-Holstein. In 1721, when the Great Northern War ended, the dukes of Gottorf lost their power and their land became Danish crown land. After the Second Schleswig War (1864), Schleswig was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia.

==Geography==

Schleswig lies at the western end of the Schlei Förde, which separates the two peninsulas of Angeln and Schwansen, and is on the western edge of the Schleswig-Holstein Uplands on the transition to the Geest country. The urban area ranges from 0 to above sea level. Brautsee (lake) is in the town.

The nearest major cities are Flensburg, Husum and Kiel. Autobahn 7 runs immediately west of the city. Highways 76 and 77 end in Schleswig and B 201 runs to the north of the town. Schleswig station is a stop for InterCity and Intercity-Express trains and is on the Hamburg–Neumünster–Flensburg and Husum–Kiel lines.

===Climate===
The climate is oceanic (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), humid and mild with a slight continental influence. The annual mean temperature is 8 °C and precipitation averages 925 mm.

<doc id="45728" wikidata="Q6663" url="?curid=45728" title="Hamburger">
<text>A hamburger, or simply a burger, is a dish consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. The patties are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis with condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish or a &quot;special sauce&quot;, often a variation of Thousand Island dressing, and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger. Under some definitions, and in some cultures, a burger is considered a sandwich.

Hamburgers are typically associated with fast-food restaurants and diners but are also sold at other restaurants, including high-end establishments. There are many international and regional variations of hamburgers. Some of the largest multinational fast-food chains feature burgers as one of their core products: McDonald&#x27;s Big Mac and Burger King&#x27;s Whopper have become global icons of American culture.

==Etymology and terminology==
The term &quot;hamburger&quot; originally derives from Hamburg, the second-largest city in Germany; however, there is no specific connection between the dish and the city.

By linguistic rebracketing, the term &quot;burger&quot; eventually became a self-standing word that is associated with many different types of sandwiches that are similar to a hamburger, but contain different meats such as buffalo in the buffalo burger, venison, kangaroo, chicken, turkey, elk, lamb or fish such as salmon in the salmon burger, and even with meatless sandwiches as is the case of the veggie burger.

The term &quot;burger&quot; can also be applied to a meat patty on its own. Since the term &quot;hamburger&quot; usually implies beef, for clarity &quot;burger&quot; may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in beef burger, turkey burger, bison burger, or portobello burger. In most English-speaking countries, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, a piece of chicken breast in a bun is a chicken burger. Americans would call this a &quot;chicken sandwich&quot; because the meat is not ground, whereas in other countries, anything with a bun is considered a &quot;burger&quot; and a &quot;sandwich&quot; has sliced bread.

==History==

Versions of the meal have been served for over a century, but its origins are still unclear. The 1758 edition of the book &quot;The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy&quot; by Hannah Glasse included a recipe called &quot;Hamburgh sausage&quot;, suggesting that it should be served &quot;roasted with toasted bread under it.&quot; A similar snack was also popular in Hamburg under the name of &quot;Rundstück warm&quot; (&quot;bread roll warm&quot;) in 1869 or earlier, and was supposedly eaten by emigrants on their way to America. However, this may have contained roasted beefsteak rather than Frikadelle. It has alternatively been suggested that Hamburg steak served between two pieces of bread and eaten by Jewish passengers travelling from Hamburg to New York on Hamburg America Line vessels (which began operations in 1847) became so well known that the shipping company gave its name to the dish. It is not known which of these stories actually marks the invention of the hamburger and explains the name.

There is a reference to a &quot;Hamburg steak&quot; as early as 1884 in &quot;The Boston Journal&quot;.[OED, under &quot;steak&quot;] On July 5, 1896, the &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; made a highly specific claim regarding a &quot;hamburger sandwich&quot; in an article about a &quot;Sandwich Car&quot;: &quot;A distinguished favorite, only five cents, is Hamburger steak sandwich, the meat for which is kept ready in small patties and &#x27;cooked while you wait&#x27; on the gasoline range.&quot;

=== Claims of invention ===
The hamburger&#x27;s origin is unclear, though &quot;hamburger steak sandwiches&quot; have been advertised in U.S. newspapers from New York to Hawaii since at least the 1890s. The invention of hamburgers is commonly attributed to various people, including Charlie Nagreen, Frank and Charles Menches, Oscar Weber Bilby, Fletcher Davis, or Louis Lassen. White Castle traces the origin of the hamburger to Hamburg, Germany, with its invention by Otto Krause. Some have pointed to a recipe for &quot;Hamburgh sausages&quot; on toasted bread, published in &quot;The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy&quot; by Hannah Glasse in 1758. Hamburgers gained national recognition in the U.S. at the 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair when the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; referred to the hamburger as &quot;the innovation of a food vendor on the pike.&quot; No conclusive argument has ended the dispute over invention. An article from ABC News sums up: &quot;One problem is that there is little written history. Another issue is that the burger spread happened largely at the World&#x27;s Fair, from tiny vendors that came and went instantly. And it is entirely possible that more than one person came up with the idea at the same time in different parts of the country.&quot;

====Louis Lassen====
Although debunked by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, a popular myth recorded by Connecticut Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro stated the first hamburger served in America was by Louis Lassen, a Danish immigrant, after he opened Louis&#x27; Lunch in New Haven in 1895. Louis&#x27; Lunch, a small lunch wagon in New Haven, Connecticut, is said to have sold the first hamburger and steak sandwich in the U.S. in 1900. &quot;New York Magazine&quot; states that &quot;The dish actually had no name until some rowdy sailors from Hamburg named the meat on a bun after themselves years later&quot;, also noting that this claim is subject to dispute. A customer ordered a quick hot meal and Louis was out of steaks. Taking ground beef trimmings, Louis made a patty and grilled it, putting it between two slices of toast. Some critics such as Josh Ozersky, a food editor for &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, claim that this sandwich was not a hamburger because the bread was toasted.

====Charlie Nagreen====
One of the earliest claims comes from Charlie Nagreen, who in 1885 sold a meatball between two slices of bread at the Seymour Fair now sometimes called the Outagamie County Fair. The Seymour Community Historical Society of Seymour, Wisconsin, credits Nagreen, now known as &quot;Hamburger Charlie&quot;, with the invention. Nagreen was 15 when he reportedly sold pork sandwiches at the 1885 Seymour Fair so customers could eat while walking. The Historical Society explains that Nagreen named the hamburger after the Hamburg steak with which local German immigrants were familiar.

====Otto Kuase====
According to White Castle, Otto Kuase was the inventor of the hamburger. In 1891, he created a beef patty cooked in butter and topped with a fried egg. German sailors later omitted the fried egg.

====Oscar Weber Bilby====
The family of Oscar Weber Bilby claims the first-known hamburger on a bun was served on July 4, 1891, on Grandpa Oscar&#x27;s farm. The bun was a yeast bun. In 1995, Governor Frank Keating proclaimed that the first true hamburger on a bun was created and consumed in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1891, calling Tulsa, &quot;The Real Birthplace of the Hamburger&quot;.

====Frank and Charles Menches====

Frank and Charles Menches claim to have sold a ground beef sandwich at the Erie County Fair in 1885 in Hamburg, New York. During the fair, they ran out of pork sausage for their sandwiches and substituted beef. The brothers exhausted their supply of sausage, so they purchased chopped-up beef from a butcher, Andrew Klein. Historian Joseph Streamer wrote that the meat was from Stein&#x27;s market, not Klein&#x27;s, despite Stein&#x27;s having sold the market in 1874. The story notes that the name of the hamburger comes from Hamburg, New York, not Hamburg, Germany. Frank Menches&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; states that these events took place at the 1892 Summit County Fair in Akron, Ohio.

====Fletcher Davis====
Fletcher Davis of Athens, Texas claimed to have invented the hamburger. According to oral histories, in the 1880s, he opened a lunch counter in Athens and served a &#x27;burger&#x27; of fried ground beef patties with mustard and Bermuda onion between two slices of bread, with a pickle on the side. The story is that in 1904, Davis and his wife Ciddy ran a sandwich stand at the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair. Historian Frank X. Tolbert noted that Athens resident Clint Murchison said his grandfather dated the hamburger to the 1880s with Fletcher &quot;Old Dave&quot; Davis. A photo of &quot;Old Dave&#x27;s Hamburger Stand&quot; from 1904 was sent to Tolbert as evidence of the claim.

====Other hamburger-steak claims====
Various non-specific claims of the invention relate to the term &quot;hamburger steak&quot; without mention of its being a sandwich. The first printed American menu listing hamburgers is an 1834 menu from Delmonico&#x27;s in New York. However, the printer of the original menu was not in business in 1834. In 1889, a menu from Walla Walla Union in Washington offered hamburger steak as a menu item.

Between 1871 and 1884, &quot;Hamburg Beefsteak&quot; was on the &quot;Breakfast and Supper Menu&quot; of the Clipper Restaurant at 311/313 Pacific Street in San Fernando, California. It cost 10 cents—the same price as mutton chops, pig&#x27;s feet in batter, and stewed veal. It was not, however, on the dinner menu. Only &quot;Pig&#x27;s Head&quot;, &quot;Calf Tongue&quot;, and &quot;Stewed Kidneys&quot; were listed. Another claim ties the hamburger to Summit County, New York, or Ohio. Summit County, Ohio, exists, but Summit County, New York, does not.

===Early major vendors===
* 1921: White Castle, Wichita, Kansas. Due to books by Upton Sinclair and Arthur Kallet discrediting the cleanliness and nutritional value of ground beef, hamburger meat was unpopular with families until the White Castle restaurant chain took it upon themselves to market the cleanliness and quality of their food through scientific studies and preparing the food in full view of customers with spotlessly clean buildings. They also reported in local newspapers how they carefully selected their meat, and opened the &quot;Food Experiment Department&quot; as a test kitchen and quality-control laboratory. They marketed and sold large numbers of small square hamburger sandwiches, known as sliders and created five holes in each patty, which helped them cook evenly and eliminated the need to flip the burger. In 1995, White Castle began selling frozen hamburgers in convenience stores and vending machines.
* 1923: Kewpee Hamburgers, or Kewpee Hotels, Flint, Michigan. Kewpee was the second hamburger chain and peaked at 400 locations before World War II. Many of these were licensed but not strictly franchised. Many closed during WWII. Between 1955 and 1967, another wave of restaurants closed or changed names. In 1967, the Kewpee licensor moved the company to a franchise system. Currently, only five locations exist.
* 1926: White Tower Hamburgers
* 1927: Little Tavern
* 1932: Krystal
* 1936: Big Boy. In 1937, Bob Wian created the double-deck hamburger at his stand in Glendale, California. Big Boy would become the name of the hamburger, mascot, and restaurant. Big Boy expanded nationally through regional franchising and subfranchising. Primarily operating as drive-in restaurants in the 1950s, interior dining gradually replaced curb service by the early 1970s. Many franchises have closed or operated independently, but the Big Boy double-deck hamburger remains the signature item at the remaining American restaurants.
* 1940: McDonald&#x27;s restaurant, San Bernardino, California, was opened by Richard and Maurice McDonald. Their introduction of the &quot;Speedee Service System&quot; in 1948 established the principles of the modern fast-food restaurant. The McDonald brothers began franchising in 1953. In 1961, Ray Kroc (the supplier of their multi-mixer milkshake machines) purchased the company from the brothers for $2.7 million and a 1.9% royalty.

==In the United States==
Hamburgers are often a feature of fast food restaurants. In the United States, the hamburger patties served by major fast food chains are usually mass-produced in factories and frozen for delivery to the site. These hamburgers are thin and of uniform thickness, differing from the traditional American hamburger prepared in homes and conventional restaurants, which is thicker and prepared by hand from ground beef. Most American hamburgers are round, but some fast-food chains, such as Wendy&#x27;s, sell square-cut hamburgers. Hamburgers in fast food restaurants are usually grilled on a flat top, but some firms, such as Burger King, use a gas flame grilling process. At conventional American restaurants, hamburgers may be ordered &quot;rare&quot; but normally are served medium-well or well-done for food safety reasons. Fast food restaurants do not usually offer this option.

The McDonald&#x27;s fast-food chain sells the Big Mac, one of the world&#x27;s top-selling hamburgers, with an estimated 550 million sold annually in the United States. Other major fast-food chains, including Burger King (also known as Hungry Jack&#x27;s in Australia), A&amp;W, Culver&#x27;s, Whataburger, Carl&#x27;s Jr./Hardee&#x27;s chain, Wendy&#x27;s (known for their square patties), Jack in the Box, Krystal, White Castle, Cook Out, Harvey&#x27;s, Hesburger, Supermac&#x27;s, Shake Shack, In-N-Out Burger, Five Guys, Fatburger, Vera&#x27;s, Burgerville, Back Yard Burgers, Lick&#x27;s Homeburger, Roy Rogers, Smashburger, and Sonic also rely heavily on hamburger sales. Fuddruckers and Red Robin are hamburger chains that specialize in the mid-tier &quot;restaurant-style&quot; variety of hamburgers.

Some restaurants offer elaborate hamburgers using expensive cuts of meat and various cheeses, toppings, and sauces. One example is the Bobby&#x27;s Burger Palace chain founded by well-known chef and Food Network star Bobby Flay.

Hamburgers are often served as a fast dinner, picnic, or party food and are often cooked outdoors on barbecue grills.

A high-quality hamburger patty is made entirely of ground (minced) beef and seasonings; these may be described as &quot;all-beef hamburger&quot; or &quot;all-beef patties&quot; to distinguish them from inexpensive hamburgers made with cost-savers like added flour, textured vegetable protein, ammonia treated defatted beef trimmings (which the company Beef Products Inc, calls &quot;lean finely textured beef&quot;), advanced meat recovery, or other fillers. In the 1930s, ground liver was sometimes added. Some cooks prepare their patties with binders like eggs or breadcrumbs. Seasonings may include salt and pepper and others like parsley, onions, soy sauce, Thousand Island dressing, onion soup mix, or Worcestershire sauce. Many name-brand seasoned salt products are also used.

=== Cost ===
According to Bloomberg News, the average price of a fast-food restaurant burger in the United States increased by 16% between 2019 and 2024, reaching $8.41 in the second quarter of 2024. Specifically, the iconic Big Mac at McDonald&#x27;s cost $5.29 during the same period, representing a 21% price increase over the same five-year span.

===Safety===
Raw hamburgers may contain harmful bacteria that can produce food-borne illnesses such as &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; O157:H7, due to the occasional initial improper preparation of the meat, so caution is needed during handling and cooking. Because of the potential for food-borne illness, the USDA, recommends hamburgers be cooked to an internal temperature of . If cooked to this temperature, they are considered well-done.

==Variations==
===Other meats===
Burgers can also be made with patties made from ingredients other than beef. For example, a &quot;turkey burger&quot; uses ground turkey meat, a &quot;chicken burger&quot; uses ground chicken meat. A &quot;buffalo burger&quot; uses ground meat from a bison, and an &quot;ostrich burger&quot; is made from ground seasoned ostrich meat. A deer burger uses ground venison from deer.

===Veggie burgers===
Vegetarian and vegan burgers can be formed from a meat analogue, a meat substitute such as tofu, TVP, seitan (wheat gluten), quorn, beans, grains or an assortment of vegetables, ground up and mashed into patties.

Vegetable patties have existed in various Eurasian cuisines for millennia and are a commonplace item in Indian cuisine.

In the 1900s, some companies began making soy-based burgers, including the Boca Burger and Lightlife. Other producers entered business with new burgers in the 2000s, including Gardein, Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat, and Meati. These products are primarily made of peas, soy, mushrooms, yeast, beans, and/or nuts.

=== Steak burgers ===

In the United States, a steak burger is a marketing term for a hamburger claimed to be of superior quality. Elsewhere, it is a burger containing a steak.

Use of the term &quot;steakburger&quot; dates to the 1920s in the United States. In the U.S. in 1934, A.H. &quot;Gus&quot; Belt, the founder of Steak &#x27;n Shake, devised a higher-quality hamburger and offered it as a &quot;steakburger&quot; to customers at the company&#x27;s first location in Normal, Illinois. This burger used a combination of ground meat from the strip portion of T-bone steak and sirloin steak in its preparation. Steakburgers are a primary menu item at Steak &#x27;n Shake restaurants, and the company&#x27;s registered trademarks included &quot;original steakburger&quot; and &quot;famous for steakburgers&quot;. Steak &#x27;n Shake&#x27;s &quot;Prime Steakburgers&quot; are now made of choice grade brisket and chuck.

Beef is typical, although other meats such as lamb and pork may also be used. The meat is ground or chopped.

In other places - including Australia and New Zealand - a steak burger contains a whole steak, not ground meat.

Steak burgers may be cooked to various degrees of doneness.

Steakburgers may be served with standard hamburger toppings such as lettuce, onion, and tomato. Some may have various additional toppings such as cheese, bacon, fried egg, mushrooms, additional meats, and others.
Various fast food outlets and restaurants such as Burger King, Carl&#x27;s Jr., Hardee&#x27;s, IHOP, Steak &#x27;n Shake, Mr. Steak, and Freddy&#x27;s market steak burgers. Some restaurants offer high-end burgers prepared from aged beef. Additionally, many restaurants have used the term &quot;steakburger&quot; at various times.

Some baseball parks concessions in the United States call their hamburgers steak burgers, such as Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, Nebraska.

Burger King introduced the Sirloin Steak sandwich in 1979 as part of a menu expansion that, in turn, was part of a corporate restructuring effort for the company. It was a single oblong patty made of chopped steak served on a sub-style sesame seed roll. Additional steak burgers that Burger King has offered are the Angus Bacon Cheddar Ranch Steak Burger, the Angus Bacon &amp; Cheese Steak Burger, and a limited edition Stuffed Steakhouse Burger.

In 2004, Steak &#x27;n Shake sued Burger King over the latter&#x27;s use of the term &quot;Steak Burger&quot; in conjunction with one of its menu items, claiming that such use infringed on trademark rights.
(According to the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;, Burger King&#x27;s attorneys &quot;grilled&quot; Steak &#x27;n Shake&#x27;s CEO in court about the precise content of Steak &#x27;n Shake&#x27;s steakburger offering.) The case was settled out of court.

===United States and Canada===

The hamburger is considered a national dish of the United States. In the United States and Canada, burgers may be classified as two main types: fast food hamburgers and individually prepared burgers made in homes and restaurants. The latter are often prepared with a variety of toppings, including lettuce, tomato, onion, and often sliced pickles (or pickle relish). French fries (or commonly Poutine in Canada) often accompany the burger. Cheese (usually processed cheese slices but often Cheddar, Swiss, pepper jack, or blue), either melted directly on the meat patty or crumbled on top, is generally an option.

Condiments might be added to a hamburger or may be offered separately on the side, including ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, salad dressings and barbecue sauce. Other toppings can include bacon, avocado or guacamole, sliced sautéed mushrooms, cheese sauce, chili (usually without beans), fried egg, scrambled egg, feta cheese, blue cheese, salsa, pineapple, jalapeños and other kinds of chili peppers, anchovies, slices of ham or bologna, pastrami or teriyaki-seasoned beef, tartar sauce, french fries, onion rings or potato chips.
* Standard hamburger toppings may depend on location, particularly at restaurants that are not national or regional franchises.
* Restaurants may offer hamburgers with multiple meat patties. The most common variants are double and triple hamburgers, but California-based burger chain In-N-Out once sold a sandwich with one hundred patties, called a &quot;100x100&quot;.
* Pastrami burgers may be served in Salt Lake City, Utah.
* A patty melt consists of a patty, sautéed onions and cheese between two slices of rye bread. The sandwich is then buttered and fried.
* A slider is a tiny square hamburger patty served on an equally small bun and usually sprinkled with diced onions. According to the earliest citations, the name originated aboard U.S. Navy ships due to how greasy burgers slid across the galley grill as the ship pitched and rolled. Other versions claim the term &quot;slider&quot; originated from the hamburgers served by flight line galleys at military airfields, which were so greasy they slid right through one, or because their small size allowed them to &quot;slide&quot; right down the throat in one or two bites.
* In Alberta, Canada, a &quot;kubie burger&quot; is a hamburger made with a pressed Ukrainian sausage (kubasa).
* A butter burger, found commonly throughout Wisconsin and the upper midwest, is a normal burger with a pad of butter as a topping or a heavily buttered bun. It is the signature menu item of the restaurant chain Culver&#x27;s.
* The Fat Boy is an iconic hamburger with chili meat sauce originating in the Greek burger restaurants of Winnipeg, Manitoba
* In Minnesota, a &quot;Juicy Lucy&quot; (also spelled &quot;Jucy Lucy&quot;), is a hamburger having cheese inside the meat patty rather than on top. A piece of cheese is surrounded by raw meat and cooked until it melts, resulting in a molten core within the patty. This scalding hot cheese tends to gush out at the first bite, so servers frequently instruct customers to let the sandwich cool for a few minutes before consumption.
* A low-carb burger is a hamburger served without a bun and replaced with large slices of lettuce, with mayonnaise or mustard being the sauces primarily used.
* A ramen burger, invented by Keizo Shimamoto, is a hamburger patty sandwiched between two discs of compressed ramen noodles in lieu of a traditional bun.
* Luther Burger is a bacon cheeseburger with two glazed doughnuts instead of buns.
* Steamed cheeseburger is a cheeseburger in which the burger is steamed instead of grilled. It was invented in Connecticut.

=== France ===
In 2012, according to a study by the NDP cabinet, the French consume 14 hamburgers in restaurants per year per person, placing them fourth in the world and second in Europe, just behind the British.

According to a study by Gira Conseil on the consumption of hamburgers in France in 2013, 75% of traditional French restaurants offer at least one hamburger on their menu, and for a third of these restaurants, it has become the leader in the range of dishes, ahead of rib steaks, grills or fish.

===Mexico===
In Mexico, burgers (called &quot;hamburguesas&quot;) are served with ham and slices of American cheese fried on top of the meat patty. The toppings include avocado, jalapeño slices, shredded lettuce, onion, and tomato. The bun has mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard. Bacon may also be added, which can be fried or grilled along with the meat patty. A slice of pineapple may be added to a hamburger for a &quot;Hawaiian hamburger&quot;.

Some restaurants&#x27; burgers also have barbecue sauce, and others replace the ground patty with sirloin, Al pastor meat, barbacoa, or fried chicken breast. Many burger chains from the United States can be found all over Mexico, including Carl&#x27;s Jr., Sonic, McDonald&#x27;s, and Burger King.

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
Hamburgers in the UK and Ireland are very similar to those in the US, and the same big two chains dominate the High Street as in the U.S. — McDonald&#x27;s and Burger King. The menus offered to both countries are virtually identical, although portion sizes tend to be smaller in the UK. In Ireland, the food outlet Supermacs is widespread throughout the country, serving burgers as part of its menu. In Ireland, Abrakebabra (started out selling kebabs) and Eddie Rocket&#x27;s are also major chains.

An original and indigenous rival to the big two U.S. giants was the quintessentially British fast-food chain Wimpy, originally known as Wimpy Bar (opened 1954 at the Lyon&#x27;s Corner House in Coventry Street London), which served its hamburgers on a plate with British-style chips, accompanied by cutlery and delivered to the customer&#x27;s table. In the late 1970s, to compete with McDonald&#x27;s, Wimpy began to open American-style counter-service restaurants, and the brand disappeared from many UK high streets when those restaurants were re-branded as Burger Kings between 1989 and 1990 by the then-owner of both brands, Grand Metropolitan. A management buyout in 1990 split the brands again, and now Wimpy table-service restaurants can still be found in many town centres, whilst new counter-service Wimpys are now often found at motorway service stations.

Hamburgers are also available from mobile kiosks, commonly known as &quot;burger vans&quot;, particularly at outdoor events such as football matches. Burgers from this type of outlet are usually served without any form of salad — only fried onions and a choice of tomato ketchup, mustard, or brown sauce.

Chip shops, particularly in the West Midlands and North-East of England, Scotland, and Ireland, serve battered hamburgers called batter burgers. This is where the burger patty is deep-fat-fried in batter and is usually served with chips.

Hamburgers and veggie burgers served with chips, and salad is standard pub grub menu items. Many pubs specialize in &quot;gourmet&quot; burgers. These are usually high-quality minced steak patties topped with things such as blue cheese, brie, avocado, anchovy mayonnaise, et cetera. Some British pubs serve burger patties made from more exotic meats, including venison burgers (sometimes nicknamed Bambi Burgers), bison burgers, ostrich burgers, and in some Australian-themed pubs even kangaroo burgers can be purchased. These burgers are served similarly to the traditional hamburger but are sometimes served with a different sauce, including redcurrant sauce, mint sauce, and plum sauce.

In the early 21st century, &quot;premium&quot; hamburger chains and independent restaurants have arisen, selling burgers produced from meat stated to be of high quality and often organic, usually served to eat on the premises rather than to take away. Chains include Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Ultimate Burger, Hamburger Union and Byron Hamburgers in London. Independent restaurants such as Meatmarket and Dirty Burger developed a style of rich, juicy burger in 2012 which is known as a &quot;dirty burger&quot; or &quot;third-wave burger&quot;.

In recent years Rustlers has sold pre-cooked hamburgers reheatable in a microwave oven in the United Kingdom.

In the UK, as in North America and Japan, the term &quot;burger&quot; can refer simply to the patty, be it beef, some other kind of meat, or vegetarian.

===Australia and New Zealand===

Fast food franchises sell American-style fast-food hamburgers in Australia and New Zealand. The traditional Australasian hamburgers are usually bought from fish and chip shops or milk bars rather than from chain restaurants. These traditional hamburgers are becoming less common as older-style fast food outlets decrease in number. The hamburger meat is almost always ground beef, or &quot;mince&quot;, as it is more commonly referred to in Australia and New Zealand. They commonly include tomato, lettuce, grilled onion, and meat as minimum—in this form, known in Australia as a &quot;plain hamburger&quot;, which often also includes a slice of beetroot—and, optionally, can include cheese, beetroot, pineapple, a fried egg, and bacon. If all these optional ingredients are included, it is known in Australia as a &quot;burger with the lot&quot;.

In Australia and New Zealand, as in the United Kingdom, the word &quot;sandwich&quot; is generally reserved for two &quot;slices&quot; of bread (from a loaf) with fillings in between them – unlike in American English where a &quot;sandwich&quot; is fillings between two pieces of any kind of bread, not only slices of bread – as such &quot;burgers&quot; are not generally considered to be &quot;sandwiches&quot;. The term &quot;burger&quot; is applied to any cut bun with a hot filling, even when the filling does not contain beef, such as a chicken burger (generally with chicken breast rather than chicken mince), salmon burger, pulled pork burger, veggie burger, etc.

The only variance between the two countries&#x27; hamburgers is that New Zealand&#x27;s equivalent to &quot;The Lot&quot; often contains a steak (beef). The condiments regularly used are barbecue sauce and tomato sauce. The traditional Australasian hamburger never includes mayonnaise. The McDonald&#x27;s &quot;McOz&quot; Burger is partway between American and Australian style burgers, having beetroot and tomato in an otherwise typical American burger; however, it is no longer a part of the menu. Likewise, McDonald&#x27;s in New Zealand created a Kiwiburger, similar to a Quarter Pounder, but features salad, beetroot, and a fried egg. The Hungry Jack&#x27;s (Burger King) &quot;Aussie Burger&quot; has tomato, lettuce, onion, cheese, bacon, beetroot, egg, ketchup, and a meat patty, while adding pineapple is an upcharge. It is essentially a &quot;Burger with the lot&quot; but uses the standard HJ circular breakfast Egg rather than the fully fried egg used by local fish shops.

===China===

In China, due to the branding of their sandwiches by McDonald&#x27;s and KFC restaurants in China, the word &quot;burger&quot; () refers to all sandwiches that consist of two pieces of bun and a meat patty in between. This has led to confusion when Chinese nationals try to order sandwiches with meat fillings other than beef in fast-food restaurants in North America.

A popular Chinese street food, known as (), consists of meat (most commonly pork) sandwiched between two buns. has been called the &quot;Chinese hamburger&quot;. Since the sandwich dates back to the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) and fits the aforementioned Chinese word for burger, Chinese media have claimed that the hamburger was invented in China.

===Japan===

In Japan, hamburgers can be served in a bun, called , or just the patties served without a bun, known as or &quot;hamburg&quot;, short for &quot;hamburg steak&quot;.

&quot;Hamburg steaks&quot; (served without buns) are similar to what are known as Salisbury steaks in the US. They are made from minced beef, pork, or a blend of the two mixed with minced onions, eggs, breadcrumbs, and spices. They are served with brown sauce (or demi-glace in restaurants) with vegetable or salad sides, or occasionally in Japanese curries. Hamburgers may be served in casual, western-style suburban restaurant chains known in Japan as &quot;family restaurants&quot;.

On the other hand, Hamburgers in buns are predominantly the domain of fast food chains. Japan has homegrown hamburger chain restaurants such as MOS Burger, First Kitchen, and Freshness Burger. Local varieties of burgers served in Japan include teriyaki burgers, burgers (containing ) and burgers containing shrimp . Some of the more unusual examples include the rice burger, where the bun is made of rice, and the luxury 1,000-yen (US$10) &quot;Takumi Burger&quot; (meaning &quot;artisan taste&quot;), featuring avocados, freshly grated wasabi, and other rare seasonal ingredients. In terms of the actual patty, there are burgers made with Kobe beef, butchered from cows that are fed with beer and massaged daily. McDonald&#x27;s Japan also recently launched a McPork burger made with US pork. McDonald&#x27;s has been gradually losing market share in Japan to these local hamburger chains due partly to the preference of Japanese diners for fresh ingredients and more refined, &quot;upscale&quot; hamburger offerings. Burger King once retreated from Japan, but re-entered the market in summer 2007 in cooperation with the Korean-owned Japanese fast-food chain Lotteria.

=== Denmark ===

In Denmark, the hamburger was introduced in 1949, though it was called the bøfsandwich. There are many variations. While the original bøfsandwich was simply a generic meat patty containing a mix of beef and horse meat, with slightly different garnish (mustard, ketchup, and soft onions), it has continued to evolve. Today, a bøfsandwich usually contains a beef patty, pickled cucumber, raw, pickled, fried or soft onions, pickled red beets, mustard, ketchup, remoulade, and perhaps most strikingly, is often overflowing with brown gravy, which is sometimes even poured on top of the assembled bøfsandwich. The original bøfsandwich is still on the menu at the same restaurant from which it originated in 1949, now run by the original owner&#x27;s grandson.

Following the popularity of the bøfsandwich, many variations sprung up, using different types of meat instead of the beef patty. One variation, the flæskestegssandwich, grew especially popular. This variation replaces the minced beef patty with slices of pork loin or belly and typically uses sweet-and-sour pickled red cabbage, mayonnaise, mustard, and pork rinds as garnish.

Today, the bøfsandwich, flæskestegssandwich, and their many variations co-exist with the more typical hamburger, with the opening of the first Burger King restaurant in 1977 popularizing the original dish in Denmark. Many local, high-end burger restaurants dot the major cities, including Popl, an offshoot of Noma.

===East Asia===
Rice burgers mentioned above are also available in several East Asian countries such as Taiwan and South Korea. Lotteria is a big hamburger franchise in Japan owned by the South Korean Lotte group, with outlets also in China, South Korea, Vietnam, and Taiwan. In addition to selling beef hamburgers, they have hamburgers made from squid, pork, tofu, and shrimp. Variations available in South Korea include Bulgogi burgers and Kimchi burgers.
In the Philippines, a wide range of major U.S. fast-food franchises are well represented, together with local imitators, often amended to the local palate. The chain McDonald&#x27;s (locally nicknamed &quot;McDo&quot;) has a range of burger and chicken dishes often accompanied by plain steamed rice or French fries. The Philippines boasts its own burger chain called Jollibee, which offers burger meals and chicken, including a signature burger called &quot;Champ&quot;. Jollibee now has several outlets in the United States, the Middle East, and East Asia.

===India===

In India, burgers are usually made from chicken or vegetable patties due to cultural beliefs against eating beef (which stem from Hindu religious practice) and pork (which stems from Islamic religious practice). Because of this, most fast food chains and restaurants in India do not serve beef. McDonald&#x27;s in India, for instance, does not serve beef, offering the &quot;Maharaja Mac&quot; instead of the Big Mac, substituting the beef patties with chicken. Another version of the Indian vegetarian burger is the wada pav, consisting of a deep-fried potato patty dipped in gram flour batter. It is usually served with mint chutney and fried green chili. Another alternative is the &quot;Buff Burger&quot;, made with buffalo meat.

===Pakistan===

In Pakistan, apart from American fast food chains, burgers can be found in stalls near shopping areas, the best known being the &quot;shami burger&quot;. This is made from &quot;shami kebab&quot;, made by mixing lentils and minced lamb. Onions, scrambled eggs, and ketchup are the most popular toppings.

===Malaysia===

In Malaysia, there are 300 McDonald&#x27;s restaurants. The menu in Malaysia also includes eggs and fried chicken on top of regular burgers. Burgers are also easily found at nearby mobile kiosks, especially Ramly Burger.

===Mongolia===

In Mongolia, a recent fast food craze due to the sudden influx of foreign influence has led to the prominence of the hamburger. Specialized fast food restaurants serving to Mongolian tastes have sprung up and seen great success.
===Turkey===

In Turkey, in addition to the internationally familiar offerings, numerous localized variants of the hamburger may be found, such as the Islak Burger (lit. &quot;Wet-Burger&quot;), which is a beef slider doused in seasoned tomato sauce and steamed inside a special glass chamber, and has its origins in the Turkish fast food retailer Kizilkayalar. Other variations include lamb burgers and offal-burgers, which are offered by local fast food businesses and global chains alike, such as McDonald&#x27;s and Burger King. Most burger shops have also adopted a pizzeria-like approach to home delivery, and almost all major fast food chains deliver.

===Yugoslavia and Serbia===

In the former Yugoslavia, and originally in Serbia, there is a local version of the hamburger known as the &quot;pljeskavica&quot;. It is often served as a patty but may also have a bun.

===Belgium and Netherlands===

Throughout Belgium and in some eateries in the Netherlands, a Bicky Burger is sold that combines pork, chicken, and horse meat. The hamburger, usually fried, is served between a bun, sprinkled with sesame seeds. It often comes with a specific &quot;Bickysaus&quot; (Bicky dressing) made with mayonnaise, mustard, cabbage, and onion.

==Unusual hamburgers==
* In May 2012, Serendipity 3 was recognized as the Guinness World Records holder for serving the world&#x27;s most expensive hamburger, the $295 Le Burger Extravagant.
* At $499, the world&#x27;s largest hamburger commercially available weighs and is sold at Mallie&#x27;s Sports Grill &amp; Bar in Southgate, Michigan. Called the &quot;Absolutely Ridiculous Burger&quot;, it takes about 12 hours to prepare. It was cooked and adjudicated on May 30, 2009.
* A $777 Kobe beef and Maine lobster burger, topped with caramelized onion, Brie cheese, and prosciutto, was reported available at Le Burger Brasserie, inside the Paris Las Vegas casino.
* On August 5, 2013, the first hamburger from a meat lab grown from cow stem cells was served. The hamburger was the result of research in the Netherlands led by Mark Post at Maastricht University and sponsored by Google&#x27;s co-founder Sergey Brin.

==Slang==
* &quot;$100 hamburger&quot; (&quot;hundred-dollar hamburger&quot;) is aviation slang for a general aviation pilot needing an excuse to fly. A $100 hamburger trip typically involves flying a short distance (less than two hours), eating at an airport restaurant, and flying home.

<text>Panthera is a genus within the family Felidae, and one of two extant genera in the subfamily Pantherinae. It contains the largest living members of the cat family. There are five living species: the jaguar, leopard, lion, snow leopard and tiger. Numerous extinct species are also named, including the cave lion and American lion.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;panther&quot; derives from classical Latin &quot;panthēra&quot;, itself from the ancient Greek &quot;pánthēr&quot; ().

==Characteristics==
In &quot;Panthera&quot; species, the dorsal profile of the skull is flattish or evenly convex. The frontal interorbital area is not noticeably elevated, and the area behind the elevation is less steeply sloped. The basic cranial axis is nearly horizontal. The inner chamber of the bullae is large, the outer small. The partition between them is close to the external auditory meatus. The convexly rounded chin is sloping.
All &quot;Panthera&quot; species have an incompletely ossified hyoid bone and a specially adapted larynx with large vocal folds covered in a fibro-elastic pad; these characteristics enable them to roar. Only the snow leopard cannot roar, as it has shorter vocal folds of that provide a lower resistance to airflow; it was therefore proposed to be retained in the genus &quot;Uncia&quot;.
&quot;Panthera&quot; species can prusten, which is a short, soft, snorting sound; it is used during contact between friendly individuals. The roar is an especially loud call with a distinctive pattern that depends on the species.

==Evolution==
The geographic origin of the genus &quot;Panthera&quot; is uncertain, though the earliest known definitive species &quot;Panthera principialis&quot; is from Tanzania. &quot;P. blytheae&quot; from northern Central Asia, originally described as the oldest known &quot;Panthera&quot; species, is suggested to be similar in skull features to the snow leopard, but subsequent studies have since agreed that it is not a member of or a related species of the snow leopard lineage and that it belongs to a different genus &quot;Palaeopanthera&quot;. The tiger, snow leopard, and clouded leopard genetic lineages likely dispersed in Southeast Asia during the Late Miocene.
Genetic studies indicate that the pantherine cats diverged from the subfamily Felinae between six and ten million years ago.
The genus &quot;Neofelis&quot; is sister to &quot;Panthera&quot;.
The clouded leopard appears to have diverged about . &quot;Panthera&quot; diverged from other cat species about and then evolved into the species tiger about , snow leopard about and leopard about . Mitochondrial sequence data from fossils suggest that the American lion (&quot;P. atrox&quot;) is a sister lineage to &quot;Panthera spelaea&quot; (the Eurasian cave or steppe lion) that diverged about , and that both &quot;P. atrox&quot; and &quot;P. spelaea&quot; are most closely related to lions among living &quot;Panthera&quot; species. The snow leopard is nested within &quot;Panthera&quot; and is the sister species of the tiger.

Results of a 2016 study based on analysis of biparental nuclear genomes suggest the following relationships of living &quot;Panthera&quot; species:

The extinct species &quot;Panthera gombaszoegensis&quot;, was probably closely related to the modern jaguar. The first fossil remains were excavated in Olivola, in Italy, and date to .
Fossil remains found in South Africa that appear to belong within the &quot;Panthera&quot; lineage date to about .

==Classification==
&quot;Panthera&quot; was named and described by Lorenz Oken in 1816 who placed all the spotted cats in this group. During the 19th and 20th centuries, various explorers and staff of natural history museums suggested numerous subspecies, or at times called &quot;races&quot;, for all &quot;Panthera&quot; species. The taxonomist Reginald Innes Pocock reviewed skins and skulls in the zoological collection of the Natural History Museum, London, and grouped subspecies described, thus shortening the lists considerably. Reginald Innes Pocock revised the classification of this genus in 1916 as comprising the tiger (&quot;P. tigris&quot;), lion (&quot;P. leo&quot;), jaguar (&quot;P. onca&quot;), and leopard (&quot;P. pardus&quot;) on the basis of common features of their skulls. Since the mid-1980s, several &quot;Panthera&quot; species became subjects of genetic research, mostly using blood samples of captive individuals. Study results indicate that many of the lion and leopard subspecies are questionable because of insufficient genetic distinction between them. Subsequently, it was proposed to group all African leopard populations to &quot;P. p. pardus&quot; and retain eight subspecific names for Asian leopard populations. Results of genetic analysis indicate that the snow leopard (formerly &quot;Uncia uncia&quot;) also belongs to the genus &quot;Panthera&quot; (&quot;P. uncia&quot;), a classification that was accepted by IUCN Red List assessors in 2008.

Based on genetic research, it was suggested to group all living sub-Saharan lion populations into &quot;P. l. leo&quot;.
Results of phylogeographic studies indicate that the Western and Central African lion populations are more closely related to those in India and form a different clade than lion populations in Southern and East Africa; southeastern Ethiopia is an admixture region between North African and East African lion populations.

Black panthers do not form a distinct species, but are melanistic specimens of the genus, most often encountered in the leopard and jaguar.

===Contemporary species===
The following list of the genus &quot;Panthera&quot; is based on the taxonomic assessment in &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; and reflects the taxonomy revised in 2017 by the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group:
===Extinct species and subspecies===

Other, now invalid, species have also been described, such as &quot;Panthera crassidens&quot; from South Africa, which was later found to be based on a mixture of leopard and cheetah fossils.

===Phylogeny===
In 2018, results of a phylogenetic study on living and fossil cats were published. This study was based on the morphological diversity of the mandibles of saber-toothed cats, their speciation and extinction rates.

<text>Hieronymus Bosch (; ; born Jheronimus van Aken ;  – 9 August 1516) was a Dutch painter from Brabant. He is one of the most notable representatives of the Early Netherlandish painting school. His work, generally oil on oak wood, mainly contains fantastic illustrations of religious concepts and narratives. Within his lifetime, his work was collected in the Netherlands, Austria, and Spain, and widely copied, especially his macabre and nightmarish depictions of hell.

Little is known of Bosch&#x27;s life, though there are some records. He spent most of it in the town of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, where he was born in his grandfather&#x27;s house. The roots of his forefathers are in Nijmegen and Aachen (which is visible in his surname: Van Aken). His pessimistic fantastical style cast a wide influence on northern art of the 16th century, with Pieter Bruegel the Elder being his best-known follower. Today, Bosch is seen as a highly individualistic painter with deep insight into humanity&#x27;s desires and deepest fears. Attribution has been especially difficult; today only about 25 paintings are confidently given to his hand along with eight drawings. About another half-dozen paintings are confidently attributed to his workshop. His most acclaimed works consist of three triptych altarpieces, including &quot;The Garden of Earthly Delights&quot;.

== Life ==
Hieronymus Bosch&#x27;s first name was originally Jheronimus (or Joen, respectively the Latin and Middle Dutch form of the name &quot;Jerome&quot;), and he signed a number of his paintings as &quot;Jheronimus Bosch&quot;.

His surname Bosch derives from his birthplace, (&#x27;Duke&#x27;s forest&#x27;), which is commonly called &quot;Den Bosch&quot; (&#x27;the forest&#x27;).

Little is known of Bosch&#x27;s life or training. He left behind no letters or diaries, and what has been identified has been taken from brief references to him in the municipal records of , and in the account books of the local order of the Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady. Nothing is known of his personality or his thoughts on the meaning of his art. Bosch&#x27;s date of birth has not been determined with certainty. It is estimated at on the basis of a hand-drawn portrait (which may be a self-portrait) made shortly before his death in 1516. The drawing shows the artist at an advanced age, probably in his late sixties.

Bosch lived all his life in and near , in the Duchy of Brabant. His grandfather Jan van Aken (died 1454) was a painter and is first mentioned in the records in 1430. Jan had five sons, four of whom were also painters. Bosch&#x27;s father, Anthonius van Aken (died 1478), acted as artistic adviser to the Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady. It is generally assumed that either Bosch&#x27;s father or one of his uncles taught the artist to paint, but none of their works survive. Bosch first appears in the municipal record on 5 April 1474, when he is named along with two brothers and a sister.

&#x27;s-Hertogenbosch was a flourishing city in 15th-century Brabant, in the south of the present-day Netherlands, at the time part of the Burgundian Netherlands, and during its lifetime passing through marriage to the Habsburgs. In 1463, four thousand houses in the town were destroyed by a catastrophic fire, which the then (approximately) thirteen-year-old Bosch presumably witnessed. He became a popular painter in his lifetime and often received commissions from abroad. In 1486/7 he joined the highly respected Brotherhood of Our Lady, a devotional confraternity of some forty influential citizens of , and seven thousand &#x27;outer-members&#x27; from around Europe.

Sometime between 1479 and 1481, Bosch married Aleid Goyaerts van den Meervenne, who was a few years his senior. The couple moved to the nearby town of Oirschot, where Aleid Goyaerts van den Meervenne had inherited a house and land from her wealthy family. An entry in the accounts of the Brotherhood of Our Lady records Bosch&#x27;s death in 1516. A funeral mass served in his memory was held in the church of Saint John on 9 August of that year.

== Works ==
Bosch produced at least sixteen triptychs: of them, eight survive fully intact with another five surviving in fragments. Bosch&#x27;s works are generally organised into three periods of his life dealing with the early works (), the middle period (), and the late period ( until his death). According to Stefan Fischer, thirteen of Bosch&#x27;s surviving paintings were completed in the late period, with seven attributed to his middle period. Bosch&#x27;s early period is studied in terms of his workshop activity and possibly some of his drawings. Indeed, he taught pupils in the workshop, who were influenced by him. The recent dendrochronological investigation of the oak panels by the scientists at the Bosch Research and Conservation Project led to a more precise dating of the majority of Bosch&#x27;s paintings.

Bosch sometimes painted in a comparatively sketchy manner, contrasting with the traditional Early Netherlandish style of painting in which the smooth surface—achieved by the application of multiple transparent glazes—conceals the brushwork.His paintings with their rough surfaces, so-called &quot;impasto&quot; painting, differed from the tradition of the great Netherlandish painters of the end of the 15th and the beginning of the 16th centuries, who wished to hide the work done and thus suggest their paintings as more nearly divine creations.

Bosch did not date his paintings, but—unusually for the time—seems to have signed several of them, although some signatures purporting to be his are certainly not. About twenty-five paintings remain today that can be attributed to him. In the late 16th century, Philip II of Spain acquired many of Bosch&#x27;s paintings. As a result, the Prado Museum in Madrid now owns the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot;, &quot;The Garden of Earthly Delights&quot;, the tabletop painting of &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things&quot; and &quot;The Haywain Triptych&quot;.

=== Painting materials ===
Bosch painted his works mostly on oak panels using oil as a medium. Bosch&#x27;s palette was rather limited and contained the usual pigments of his time. He mostly used azurite for blue skies and distant landscapes, green copper-based glazes and paints consisting of malachite or verdigris for foliage and foreground landscapes, and lead-tin-yellow, ochres and red lake (carmine or madder lake) for his figures.

=== &quot;The Garden of Earthly Delights&quot; ===
One of his most famous triptychs is &quot;The Garden of Earthly Delights&quot; () whose outer panels are intended to bracket the main central panel between the Garden of Eden depicted on the left panel and the Last Judgment depicted on the right panel. It is attributed by Fischer as a transition painting rendered by Bosch from between his middle period and his late period. In the left hand panel God presents Eve to Adam; innovatively God is given a youthful appearance. The figures are set in a landscape populated by exotic animals and unusual semi-organic hut-shaped forms. The central panel is a broad panorama teeming with nude figures engaged in innocent, self-absorbed joy, as well as fantastical compound animals, oversized fruit, and hybrid stone formations.

The right panel presents a hellscape; a world in which humankind has succumbed to the temptations of evil and is reaping eternal damnation. Set at night, the panel features cold colours, tortured figures and frozen waterways. The nakedness of the human figures has lost any eroticism suggested in the central panel, as large explosions in the background throw light through the city gate and spill onto the water in the panel&#x27;s midground.

=== &quot;Triptych of the Temptation of St. Anthony&quot; ===
Triptych of the Temptation of St. Anthony is one of the most famous Bosch&#x27;s works along with &quot;The Garden of Earthly Delights&quot;. It shows Saint Anthony being tempted or assailed in the desert by demons, whose temptations he resisted; the &quot;Temptation of St Anthony&quot; (or &quot;Trial...&quot;) is the more common name of the subject. But strictly there are at least two different episodes deriving from Athanasius&#x27;s &quot;Life of St. Anthony&quot; and later versions of the life that may be represented, though all usually have this name.

The most common is the temptation, by seductive women and other demonic forms, but the Martin Schongauer composition (copied by Michelangelo) probably shows a later episode where St Anthony, normally flown about the desert supported by angels, was ambushed and attacked in mid-air by devils. Anasthasius describes another episode where the saint was attacked on the ground.

== Interpretation ==

In the 20th century, when changing artistic tastes made artists like Bosch more palatable to the European imagination, it was sometimes argued that Bosch&#x27;s art was inspired by heretical points of view (e.g., the ideas of the Cathars and/or putative Adamites or Brethren of the Free Spirit) as well as by obscure hermetic practices. Again, since Erasmus had been educated at one of the houses of the Brethren of the Common Life in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, and the town was religiously progressive, some writers have found it unsurprising that strong parallels exist between the caustic writing of Erasmus and the often bold painting of Bosch.

Others, following a strain of Bosch-interpretation datable already to the 16th century, continued to think his work was created merely to titillate and amuse, much like the &quot;grotteschi&quot; of the Italian Renaissance. While the art of the older masters was based in the physical world of everyday experience, Bosch confronts his viewer with, in the words of the art historian Walter Gibson, &quot;a world of dreams [and] nightmares in which forms seem to flicker and change before our eyes&quot;. In one of the first known accounts of Bosch&#x27;s paintings, in 1560 the Spaniard Felipe de Guevara wrote that Bosch was regarded merely as &quot;the inventor of monsters and chimeras&quot;. In the early 17th century, the artist-biographer Karel van Mander described Bosch&#x27;s work as comprising &quot;wondrous and strange fantasies&quot;; however, he concluded that the paintings are &quot;often less pleasant than gruesome to look at&quot;.

In recent decades, scholars have come to view Bosch&#x27;s vision as less fantastic, and accepted that his art reflects the orthodox religious belief systems of his age. His depictions of sinful humanity and his conceptions of Heaven and Hell are now seen as consistent with those of late medieval didactic literature and sermons. Most writers attach a more profound significance to his paintings than had previously been supposed, and attempt to interpret them in terms of a late medieval morality. It is generally accepted that Bosch&#x27;s art was created to teach specific moral and spiritual truths in the manner of other Northern Renaissance figures, such as the poet Robert Henryson, and that the images rendered have precise and premeditated significance. According to Dirk Bax, Bosch&#x27;s paintings often represent visual translations of verbal metaphors and puns drawn from both biblical and folkloric sources.

Latterly art historians have added a further dimension to the subject of ambiguity in Bosch&#x27;s work, emphasising ironic tendencies, for example in &quot;The Garden of Earthly Delights&quot;, both in the central panel (delights), and the right panel (hell). They theorise that the irony offers the option of detachment, both from the real world and from the painted fantasy world, thus appealing to both conservative and progressive viewers. According to Joseph Koerner, some of the cryptic qualities of the artist&#x27;s work are due to his special focus on social, political, and spiritual enemies, whose symbolism is, by nature, disguised because it is intended to conceal the artist from criticism and harm.

A 2012 study on Bosch&#x27;s paintings alleges that they actually conceal a strong nationalist consciousness, censuring the foreign imperial government of the Burgundian Netherlands, especially Maximilian Habsburg. By systematically superimposing images and concepts, the study asserts that Bosch also made his expiatory self-punishment, for he was accepting well-paid commissions from the Habsburgs and their deputies, and therefore betraying the memory of Charles the Bold.

== Debates on attribution ==

The exact number of Bosch&#x27;s surviving works has been a subject of considerable debate. His signature can be seen on only seven of his surviving paintings, and there is uncertainty whether all the paintings once ascribed to him were actually from his hand. It is known that from the early 16th century onward, numerous copies and variations of his paintings began to circulate. In addition, his style was highly influential, and was widely imitated by his numerous followers.

Over the years, scholars have attributed to him fewer and fewer of the works once thought to be his. This is partly a result of technological advances such as infrared reflectography, which enable researchers to examine a painting&#x27;s underdrawing. Art historians of the early and mid-20th century, such as Tolnay and Baldass, identified between thirty and fifty paintings that they believed to be by Bosch&#x27;s hand. A later monograph by Gerd Unverfehrt (1980) attributed twenty-five paintings and 14 drawings to him.

In early 2016, &quot;The Temptation of St. Anthony&quot;, a small panel in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri, long attributed to the workshop of Hieronymus Bosch, was credited to the painter himself after intensive forensic study by the Bosch Research and Conservation Project. The BRCP has also questioned whether two well-known paintings traditionally accepted to be by Bosch, &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot; in the Prado and &quot;Christ Carrying the Cross&quot; in the Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent should instead be credited to the artist&#x27;s workshop rather than to the painter&#x27;s own hand.

<text>Visual DialogScript (VDS) is an interpreted programming language for Microsoft Windows, using dialog and graphic elements to create programs. VDS is similar to other programming languages such as Visual Basic, C++, or Delphi, as they use Windows API.

==Language==
The syntax of VDS is straightforward. Each command occupies one line and has a plain English name that clearly describes its purpose. Variables are typeless and can hold many kinds of information, such as numbers or text. Functions are clearly distinguishable with names that start with &#x27;@&#x27;, similar to a spreadsheet.

The DialogScript language has a syntax similar to the MS-DOS batch language. It is designed for ease of use and efficiency when being interpreted by the run-time engine. There are 10 system variables, %0 to %9, which initially have the script file name in %0 and command line parameters in %1 through %9, just as in a batch file. There are also a further 26 user variables, from %A to %Z. The contents of all variables (including system ones) can be changed once the script is running. There are now also 4032 global variables. These variables begin with %%, a letter, then alphanumerics plus underscores (e.g., %%my_variable_1.) There is no limit on the length of these user-defined variable names.

==History==
Julian Moss (1953 – October 24, 2014[1]) of JM-Tech/Tech-Pro Ltd. created Visual DialogScript. In 1998, after version 3.0, Emmanuel Daunizeau of S.A.D.E. Sarl took over the ownership and development of VDS. He modified and improved its syntax. The British company Commercial Research Ltd. currently markets VDS, though it is still the property of Emmanuel Daunizeau, who continues to develop it.

The developers have released several versions of VDS over time.
* Visual DialogScript 2.0
* Visual DialogScript 2.5
* Visual DialogScript 3.0
* Visual DialogScript 3.5
* Visual DialogScript 4
* Visual DialogScript 4.5
* Visual DialogScript 5
* Visual DialogScript 5.01
* Visual DialogScript 5.02
* Visual DialogScript 6

==Currently available versions==
There are several versions available for download:
# Personal Visual DialogScript (PVDS) 4: This freeware version is intended for students and home PC users. The package includes a tutorial and online help. The software is not licensable for commercial use. This version is incapable of producing compiled executable files; however, compiling files is not necessary, as a script file can be executed directly by opening it from Windows Explorer on any system that has PVDS installed on it.
# Visual DialogScript 2.5 (16-Bit Edition): This version marked the last release for Windows 3.1+ (16-bit).
# Visual DialogScript 5: This version is intended for power users, business users, and professional developers who use—or are developing scripts for—Windows 95/98/ME or Windows NT/2000/XP. This version can create compiled executable files, and includes a royalty-free run-time license (once registered). Additional features include an icon editor and support for many add-on extensions. As a 32-bit program, it supports long filenames, taskbar tray icons, unlimited length strings, and string lists, and the Windows Registry. This legacy version is now available for download for registered users and is not available for purchase.
# Visual DialogScript 6: The newest version of Visual DialogScript improves upon Visual DialogScript 5 and adds full support for Windows Vista. Additionally, the registered version can now create standalone compiled executable files that do not require an external runtime file.

<text>Mazara del Vallo (; [matˈtsaːɾa]) is a city and in the province of Trapani, southwestern Sicily, Italy. It lies mainly on the left bank at the mouth of the Mazaro river.

It is an agricultural and fishing centre and its port gives shelter to the largest fishing fleet in Italy. The city is also one of the most historically significant in Sicily.

== History ==
=== Etymology and origins ===

Mazara was founded by the Phoenicians in the 9th century BC with the name of &quot;Mazar&quot; who made it an important mercantile emporium. The discovery of Phoenician vases demonstrate the existence of a Phoenician port built between the 6th and 5th centuries BC. Other evidence is in the palace of the Knights of Malta, where finds show the existence of the ancient Punic trading post. Also, a stone slab engraved with a Phoenician inscription found in the channel of the river Màzaro is now preserved in the Museum of the Dancing Satyr.

It then passed under the control of Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Ostrogoths, Byzantines, before being occupied by the Arabs in the year 827 AD. During the Arab period, Sicily was divided into three different administrative regions, &quot;Val di Noto&quot;, &quot;Val Demone&quot; and &quot;Val di Mazara&quot;, making the city an important commercial harbour and centre of learning.

In 1072, Mazara was conquered by Normans, headed by Roger I. During that period, in 1093, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mazara del Vallo was instituted.

After the death of Emperor Frederick II, Sicily passed to the Angevins, then followed by the Catalans of the Aragon Crown. The Aragon period (1282–1409) is characterized by a political, economic and demographic decline of Mazara. The city passed under the control of the House of Savoy in 1713, a reign which lasted only five years, being replaced by the Habsburg Empire (for 16 years) followed by the Bourbons. In 1860 the city was finally conquered by Giuseppe Garibaldi and the Mille, thus joining the then newly formed Kingdom of Italy.

The city was known as &quot;Mazzara del Vallo&quot; until the World War II period, following which the spelling was changed to &quot;Mazara del Vallo&quot;.

=== Today ===
Today Mazara is widely considered to be one of the most important fishing centres of Italy; tussles about fishing rights, especially with the North-African countries, figure large in the town&#x27;s recent history, boat sequestrations being a common event. Currently the fishing business in the city seems to be less significant, mainly because of the increasing lack of younger people willing to work in the industry.

==Geography==
Mazara borders the municipalities of Campobello di Mazara, Castelvetrano, Marsala, Petrosino, and Salemi. It counts the hamlets (&quot;frazioni&quot;) of Borgata Costiera and Mazara Due.

==Main sights==
Mazara made national news in March 1998, when a bronze statue called the &quot;Dancing Satyr&quot; (&quot;Satiro Danzante&quot;) was found off the port, at a depth of in the Strait of Sicily by a local fishing boat. The statue is believed to have been sculpted by Greek artist Praxiteles and is now on display to the public in a dedicated museum in the city, after having been on show at the Chamber of Deputies of Rome, and in Aichi, Japan. After this event, the city quickly gained in terms of visiting tourists and a national advertising campaign was mounted with the slogan &quot;Mazara del Satiro&quot;.

Other attractions include the &quot;Norman Arc&quot;, that is the remains of the old Norman Castle built in 1073 and demolished in 1880, and a number of churches, including the Royal Saint Nicholas (&quot;San Nicolò Regale&quot;) Church, a rare example of Norman architecture built in 1124, the Seminary, built in 1710, which surrounds the main local piazza, &quot;Piazza della Repubblica&quot;, and St. Vitus on the Sea (&quot;San Vito a Mare&quot;) Church. In honour of St. Vitus, the official patronal saint as well as a native of Mazara del Vallo, the St. Vitus Feast (&quot;Lu Fistinu di Santu Vitu&quot;) is held every year.

== Transportation ==
Mazara del Vallo is connected to the rest of Sicily by a regional train service (run by Trenitalia), a private bus service (only to Palermo), and by car, via the A29 highway (also known as &quot;Palermo-Mazara del Vallo&quot;). It is reachable from Trapani-Birgi Airport by an infrequent bus service or by taxi (€20 per person) and from Palermo by car or taxi.

During the summer period, Mazara is also connected via ferry to the island of Pantelleria.

<text>Asti ( , ; ; ) is a &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) of 74,348 inhabitants (1–1–2021) located in the Italian region of Piedmont, about east of Turin, in the plain of the Tanaro River. It is the capital of the province of Asti and it is deemed to be the modern capital of Montferrat.
== History ==
=== Ancient times and early Middle Ages ===
People have lived in and around what is now Asti since the Neolithic period. Before their defeat in 174 BC by the Romans, tribes of Ligures, the Statielli, dominated the area and the toponym probably derives from &quot;Ast&quot; which means &quot;hill&quot; in the ancient Celtic language.

In 124 BC the Romans built a &quot;castrum&quot;, or fortified camp, which eventually evolved into a full city named Hasta. In 89 BC the city received the status of &quot;colonia&quot;, and in 49 BC that of &quot;municipium&quot;. Asti became an important city of the Augustan Regio IX, favoured by its strategic position on the Tanaro river and on the Via Fulvia, which linked Derthona (Tortona) to Augusta Taurinorum (Turin). Other roads connected the city to the main passes for what are today Switzerland and France.

The city was crucial during the early stages of the barbarian invasions which stormed Italy during the fall of the Western Roman Empire. In early 402 AD, the Visigoths had invaded northern Italy and were advancing on Mediolanum (modern Milan) which was the imperial capital at that time. Honorius, the young emperor and a resident in that city, unable to wait for promised reinforcements any longer, was compelled to flee from Milan for safety in the city of Arles in Gaul. However, just after his convoy had left Milan and crossed the River Po his escape route through the Alps was cut off by the Gothic cavalry. This forced him to take emergency refuge in the city of Hasta until more Roman troops could be assembled in Italy. The Goths placed Hasta under siege until March when General Stilicho, bringing reinforcements from the Rhine, fought and defeated them at the Battle of Pollentia. After this first victorious defence, thanks to a massive line of walls, Hasta suffered from the barbarian invasions which stormed Italy after the fall of the Western Empire, and declined economically.

In the second half of the 6th century, it was chosen as a seat for one of the 36 Duchies in which the Lombards divided Italy. The territory of Asti comprised a wide area, stretching out to Albenga and the Maritime Alps. This remained when northern Italy was conquered by the Franks in 774, with the title of County.

In the late Carolingian age, Asti was ruled directly by his bishops, who were the main landlords of the area. Most important are Audax (904-926) and Bruningus (937-966), who moved the episcopal seat to the Castel Vecchio (&quot;Old Castle&quot;), where it remained until 1409. The bishopric of Asti remained a powerful entity well into the 11th century when Pietro II received huge privileges by emperor Henry II. In the second half of the century, Bishop Otto tried to resist the aims of the powerful countess Adelaide of Susa, who damaged the city several times. During Otto&#x27;s reign, a commune and the consul magistrates are mentioned for the first time (1095).

=== Local power ===

Asti was one of the first free communes of Italy, and in 1140 received the right to mint coins of its own by Conrad II. As the commune, however, had begun to erode the lands of the bishop and other local feudatories, the latter sued for help to Frederick Barbarossa, who presented under the city walls with a huge army in February 1155. After a short siege, Asti was stormed and burnt. Subsequently, Asti adhered to the Lombard League (1169) against the German emperor, but was again defeated in 1174. Despite this, after the Peace of Constance (1183), the city gained further privileges.

The 13th century saw the peak of the Astigiani economic and cultural splendour, only momentarily hindered by wars against Alba, Alessandria, Savoy, Milan (which besieged the city in 1230) and the Marquesses of Montferrat and Saluzzo. In particular, the commune aimed to gain control over the lucrative trade routes leading northwards from the Ligurian ports. In this period, the rise of the Casane Astigiane resulted in contrasting political familial alliances of Guelph and Ghibelline supporters. During the wars led by Emperor Frederick II in northern Italy, the city chose his side: Asti was defeated by the Guelphs of Alessandria at Quattordio and Clamandrana, but thanks to Genoese help, it recovered easily. After Frederick&#x27;s death, the struggle against Thomas II of Savoy became fierce: the Astigiani defeated him on February 23, 1255, at the Battle of Montebruno, but Thomas (who had been taken prisoner) replied ordering all traders from Asti to be arrested in Savoy and France. This move showed worry on the part of Asti&#x27;s neighbouring states over the excessive power gained by the city, which had captured Alba and controlled both Chieri and Turin.

This state of affairs led to the intervention of Charles I of Anjou, then King of Naples and the most powerful man in Italy. After some guerrilla actions, Asti signed a pact of alliance with Pavia, Genoa and William VII of Montferrat. In 1274 the Astigiani troops were defeated at the Battle of Cassano, but, on December 12, 1275, were victorious over the Angevins at the Battle of Roccavione, ending Charles&#x27; attempt to expand in Piedmont. In the 1290s, after William VII had also been defeated, Asti was the most powerful city in Piedmont. However, internal struggles for the control of trading and banking enterprises soon divided the city into factions. The most prominent faction was the powerful bankers of the Solari family, who, in 1314, gave the city to king Robert of Naples.

In 1339 the Ghibelline exiles recaptured the city, expelling the Solari and their allies. In 1342 however, the menace of the Solari counteroffensive led the new rulers to submit to Luchino Visconti of Milan. Visconti built a citadel and a second ring of walls to protect the new burgs of the city. In 1345, at the Battle of Gamenario, the Ghibelline Astigiani and John II of Montferrat again defeated the Neapolitan troops. After the Battle of Gamenario, John expanded the territory of Montferrat going so far as to take control of Asti from Milan in 1356. John ruled over Asti until 1372, but seven years later the city council submitted to Galeazzo II Visconti&#x27;s authority. Later in 1389, when Galeazzo&#x27;s daughter Valentina Visconti marries Louis of Valois, Duke of Orléans, Asti will be included as part of her dowry.

=== French and Savoyard domination ===
With the exception of several brief periods under Visconti, Montferrat and Sforza rule, Asti remained under Valois control; it eventually became a direct subject of the French Crown. The situation changed in the early 16th century, during the wars between Charles V and Francis I of France. In 1526 it was besieged in vain by Charles&#x27; condottiero Fabrizio Maramaldo. Three years later, Asti was conveyed as a result of the Treaty of Cambrai to the Holy Roman Empire by which it was ruled until 1531 when Emperor Charles V gave the territory as a fiefdom to his cousin Beatrice of Portugal, Duchess of Savoy. Later at the time of Beatrice&#x27;s death in 1538, Asti was inherited by her son and included on the Savoys&#x27; heritage. 

Asti was one of the main Savoyard strongholds in later wars. In 1616, besieged by the Spanish governor of Milan, it was defended by Duke Charles Emmanuel I himself. In 1630–31, the city suffered a high mortality rate from an outbreak of the plague. Some years later Asti was conquered by the Spanish, although Savoy regained the city in 1643. Another unsuccessful Spanish siege occurred in 1650. In November 1703, during the War of Spanish Succession, Asti fell to France again; it was reconquered in 1705 by Victor Amadeus II. In 1745 French troops invaded the city once more, but it was liberated the following year.

In 1797 the Astigiani, enraged by the continuous military campaigns and by their resulting poor economic situation, revolted against the Savoyard government. On July 28 the Repubblica Astese was declared. However, it was suppressed only two days later. The revolutionary chiefs were arrested and executed. The following year the Savoyards were expelled from Piedmont by the French revolutionary army, and Asti was occupied by general Montrichard. After a short reversal, the French returned after the victory at Marengo (1800) near to Alessandra. Napoleon himself visited Asti on April 29, 1805, but was received rather coldly by the citizens. The city was demoted and incorporated with Alessandra under the department of Marengo. After the end of the French empire, Asti returned to Piedmont in 1814; the city followed Piedmontese history until the unification of Italy in 1861.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Asti has a continental climate which is moderated by the proximity of the Mediterranean sea: its winters are warmer, and its summers cooler than Turin. Rain falls mostly during the spring and autumn; during the hottest months, rain is less common, but stronger when it does occur, usually in thunderstorms. During November and December in particular, the town of Asti can be prone to fog, which is less common in the higher-altitude areas that surround it.


== Government ==
== Main sights ==
Sections of the ancient city walls remain on the north side of the city and in the late 20th century building work uncovered a section of Roman wall in the center of the city.

The area to the northwest of the city, between the centre and the cathedral, is rich in medieval palaces and merchants&#x27; houses, many with monumental towers. Asti was known as the city of 100 towers (although there were 120 in total) of which several still remain, among them, the &quot;Tower of the Comentini&quot; (13th century), the octagonal &quot;Torre de Regibus&quot; and &quot;Torre Troyana&quot; (13th century), as well as the ancient &quot;Torre Rossa&quot;, built during the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus.

Asti is the home to several old churches. These include:
*&quot;Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta&quot; (built in the 13th century over another Cathedral), one of the biggest in Piedmont, in Romanesque-Gothic style. The monument belfry is from 1266. the façade is characterized by three portals, each surmounted by a big rose window. The interior, with a nave and two aisles, houses a cycle of 18th-century frescoes, some altarpieces by Gandolfino d&#x27;Asti and precious silver artworks from the 15th-16th centuries. The presbytery has a noteworthy mosaic floor, from the pre-existing church. Next to the last pilasters of the nave are two 14th-century artworks, the funerary seal of bishop Baldracco Malabaila and the equestrian portrait of Arricino Moneta.
*&quot;Collegiata di San Secondo&quot; (13th century) in the old medieval centre next to the Palazzo Civico. It is dedicated to the city&#x27;s patron saint, Secundus of Asti. The crypt is from the 6th century. The façade has three notable Gothic portals, while the interior houses a polyptych by Gandolfino d&#x27;Asti and other works.
*&quot;Santa Maria Nuova&quot; (11th century).
*&quot;San Martino&quot;, First mentioned in 886, the old Gothic edifice was dismantled in 1696 and rebuilt along Baroque lines in 1736.
*&quot;Sant&#x27;Anastasio&quot; (8th-12th century), whose museum has some antique capitals and sculptures.
*&quot;Santa Caterina&quot; Baroque church
*&quot;Baptistery of San Pietro&quot;(12th century) building from the High Middle Ages in the city. It has an octagonal plan with a wide dome.
*&quot;San Pietro in Consavia&quot; (15th century), with elegant external decorations. It is the seat of the Archaeological Museum, with Roman and Egyptian works.

There is a synagogue and a museum depicting the history of Asti&#x27;s Jewish community, whose presence is documented since 812.

== Events ==

One of the most famous events held in Asti is the famous Palio di Asti, in which all the old town wards, called &quot;Rioni&quot; and &quot;Borghi&quot; plus nearby towns compete in a bare-back horse race. This event recalls a victory in battle versus the rival city Alba, during the Middle Ages after the victorious battle a race was held around Alba&#x27;s walls, and from then on every year in Asti. Asti&#x27;s Palio is the oldest recorded one in Italy, and in modern times is held in the triangular Piazza Alfieri preceded by a medieval pageant through the old town on the 3rd Sunday of September.

== Wine ==

The three neighbouring Provinces of Asti, Cuneo, and Alessandria incorporate the Langhe and Monferrato Hills region in the centre of Piedmont, limestone and sandstone deposits laid down by the retreating Adriatic some 5 million years ago, and are home to some of Italy&#x27;s most known red wines, plus some white ones.

Asti is the centre of production of the sparkling Asti (DOCG, often known as &quot;Asti Spumante&quot;). Asti is typically sweet and low in alcohol (often below 8%). It is made solely from the &quot;moscato bianco&quot; white muscat grape. Other wines include a premium version known as Moscato d&#x27;Asti (DOCG) and the red Barbera.

The first products from the province of Asti to become known internationally are Martini and Rossi, Gancia and Riccadonna, which made commercial wines like Asti Spumante; red wines such as Barbera d&#x27;Asti, Freisa d&#x27;Asti, Grignolino d&#x27;Asti, Bonarda, Grignolino and Ruché di Castagnole Monferrato are also becoming widespread worldwide. These wines and many others can be sampled during the week-long Douja d&#x27;Or wine exhibition which is held at the same time as the Palio and Sagre.

The first documentation on the variety Freisa d&#x27;Asti are from the beginning of the 16th century. 



== Food ==
Asti is also famous for its Asti&#x27;s Festival of Festivals, held in September a week before the Palio. During the festival most of the towns in Asti&#x27;s province meet in a great square called &quot;Campo del Palio&quot;, they offer typical food and wine for which they are known. On the Sunday of the Sagre, all the towns involved stage a parade with floats depicting traditional farming with everyone in costume along Asti&#x27;s roads to reach &quot;Campo del Palio&quot; square.

Asti province becomes a gourmand&#x27;s delight from October to December in the white truffle or &quot;tartufo bianco&quot; season. Although neighbouring Alba is better known for its October truffle fair, some of the best truffles are found around Asti&#x27;s hills, and every weekend there is a local truffle festival.

==Sport==
The main football club of the town was Asti Calcio F.C. (ex-A.C.D. Asti), which folded in 2017. Another football club, A.S.D. Colline Alfieri Don Bosco (ex-A.C. Celle, from Celle Enomondo), relocated to the city and was renamed to &quot;A.S.D. Alfieri Asti&quot; in 2017. Since 2019 it was known as A.S.D. Asti.

Former futsal league champion, A.S.D. Asti Calcio a 5 is also based in Asti.

<doc id="45745" wikidata="Q173082" url="?curid=45745" title="Dacia">
<text>Dacia (, ; ) was the land inhabited by the Dacians, its core in Transylvania, stretching to the Danube in the south, the Black Sea in the east, and the Tisza in the west. The Carpathian Mountains were located in the middle of Dacia. It thus roughly corresponds to present-day Romania, as well as parts of Moldova, Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, Slovakia, and Ukraine.

A Dacian kingdom that united the Dacians and the Getae was formed under the rule of Burebista in 82 BC and lasted until the Roman conquest in AD 106. As a result of the wars with the Roman Empire, after the conquest of Dacia, the population was dispersed, and the capital city, Sarmizegetusa Regia, was destroyed by the Romans. However, the Romans built a settlement bearing the same name, Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetuza 40 km away, to serve as the capital of the new Roman province of Dacia. A group of &quot;Free Dacians&quot; may have remained outside the Roman Empire in the territory of modern-day Northern Romania until the start of the Migration Period.

== Nomenclature ==
The Dacians are first mentioned in the writings of the Ancient Greeks, in Herodotus (&quot;Histories&quot; Book IV XCIII: &quot;[Getae] the noblest as well as the most just of all the Thracian tribes&quot;) and Thucydides (&quot;Peloponnesian Wars&quot;, Book II: &quot;[Getae] border on the Scythians and are armed in the same manner, being all mounted archers&quot;). Some historians argue that Daxia (mentioned in 3rd century BC) was the previous home of Indo-Iranian nomads who later came to form the Geto-Dacian people.

==Geographical history==


The extent and location of Dacia varied in its three distinct historical periods (see below):


=== 1st century BC ===
The Dacia of King Burebista (82–44 BC) stretched from the Black Sea to the river Tisza. During that period, the Getae and Dacians conquered a wider territory and Dacia extended from the Middle Danube to the Black Sea littoral (between Apollonia and Pontic Olbia) and from the Northern Carpathians to the Balkan Mountains. After the death of Burebista in 44 BCE, his Kingdom quickly unraveled, but the Dacians remained a significant enough force to frequently make incursions into Roman territory.
=== 1st century AD ===
Strabo, in his Geography written around AD 20, says:

″As for the southern part of Germany beyond the Albis, the portion which is just contiguous to that river is occupied by the Suevi; then immediately adjoining this is the land of the Getae, which, though narrow at first, stretching as it does along the Ister [Danube] on its southern side and on the opposite side along the mountain-side of the Hercynian Forest (for the land of the Getae also embraces a part of the mountains), afterwards broadens out towards the north as far as the Tyregetae; but I cannot tell the precise boundaries″

On this basis, Lengyel and Radan (1980), Hoddinott (1981) and Mountain (1998) consider that the Geto-Dacians inhabited both sides of the Tisza river prior to the rise of the Celtic Boii. The hold of the Dacians between the Danube and the Tisza was tenuous. However, the archaeologist Parducz argued for a Dacian presence west of the Tisa dating from the time of Burebista. According to Tacitus (AD 56–117) Dacians bordered Germania in the south-east, while Sarmatians bordered it in the east.

In the 1st century AD, the Iazyges settled West of Dacia, on the plain between the Danube and the Tisa rivers, according to the scholars&#x27; interpretation of Pliny&#x27;s text: &quot;The higher parts between the Danube and the Hercynian Forest as far as the winter quarters of Pannonia at Carnutum and the plains and level country of the German frontiers there are occupied by the Sarmatian Iazyges, while the Dacians whom they have driven out hold the mountains and forests as far as the river Theiss&quot;.

=== 2nd century AD ===
Starting with AD 85, Dacia was once again reunified under King Decebalus. Following an incursion into Roman Moesia, which resulted in the death of its governor, Gaius Oppius Sabinus, a series of conflicts between the Romans and Dacians ensued. Although the Romans gained a major strategic victory at Tapae in AD 88, Emperor Domitian offered the Dacians favourable terms, in exchange for which Roman suzerainty was recognised. However, Emperor Trajan restarted the conflicts in AD 101-102 and then again in AD 105–106, which ended with the annexation of most of Dacia and its reorganisation as a Roman Province, Dacia Felix.

Written a few decades after Emperor Trajan&#x27;s Roman conquest of parts of Dacia in AD 105–106, Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geographia&quot; included the boundaries of Dacia. According to the scholars&#x27; interpretation of Ptolemy (Hrushevskyi 1997, Bunbury 1879, Mocsy 1974, Bărbulescu 2005) Dacia was the region between the rivers Tisza, Danube, upper Dniester, and Siret. Mainstream historians accept this interpretation: Avery (1972) Berenger (1994) Fol (1996) Mountain (1998), Waldman Mason (2006).

Ptolemy also provided a couple of Dacian toponyms in south Poland in the Upper Vistula (Polish: Wisla) river basin: Susudava and Setidava (with a manuscript variant Getidava). This could have been an &quot;echo&quot; of Burebista&#x27;s expansion. It seems that this northern expansion of the Dacian language, as far as the Vistula river, lasted until AD 170–180 when the migration of the Vandal Hasdingi pushed out this northern Dacian group. This Dacian group, possibly the Costoboci/Lipița culture, is associated by Gudmund Schütte with towns having the specific Dacian language ending &quot;dava&quot; i.e. Setidava.

After the Marcomannic Wars (AD 166–180), Dacian groups from outside Roman Dacia had been set in motion. So too were the 12,000 Dacians &quot;from the neighbourhood of Roman Dacia sent away from their own country&quot;. Their native country could have been the Upper Tisa region, but other places cannot be excluded.

The later Roman province &quot;Dacia Aureliana&quot;, was organized inside former Moesia Superior after the retreat of the Roman army from Dacia, during the reign of emperor Aurelian during AD 271–275. It was reorganized as Dacia Ripensis (as a military province) and Dacia Mediterranea (as a civil province).

== Cities ==
Ptolemy gives a list of 43 names of towns in Dacia, out of which arguably 33 were of Dacian origin. Most of the latter included the added suffix &quot;dava&quot; (meaning settlement, village). But, other Dacian names from his list lack the suffix (e.g. Zarmisegethusa regia = Zermizirga). In addition, nine other names of Dacian origin seem to have been Latinised.

The cities of the Dacians were known as &quot;-dava&quot;, &quot;-deva&quot;, -δαυα (&quot;-dawa&quot; or &quot;-dava&quot;, Anc. Gk.), -δεβα (&quot;-deva&quot;, Byz. Gk.) or -δαβα (&quot;-dava&quot;, Byz. Gk.), etc. .

#In Dacia: &quot;Acidava&quot;, &quot;Argedava&quot;, &quot;Buridava&quot;, &quot;Dokidava&quot;, &quot;Carsidava&quot;, &quot;Clepidava&quot;, &quot;Cumidava&quot;, &quot;Marcodava&quot;, &quot;Netindava&quot;, &quot;Patridava&quot;, &quot;Pelendava&quot;, &quot;*Perburidava&quot;, &quot;Petrodaua&quot;, &quot;Piroboridaua&quot;, &quot;Rhamidaua&quot;, &quot;Rusidava&quot;, &quot;Sacidava&quot;, &quot;Sangidava&quot;, &quot;Setidava&quot;, &quot;Singidava&quot;, &quot;Tamasidava&quot;, &quot;Utidava&quot;, &quot;Zargidava&quot;, &quot;Ziridava&quot;, &quot;Sucidava&quot;26 names altogether.
# In Lower Moesia (the present Northern Bulgaria) and Scythia minor (Dobrudja): &quot;Aedeba&quot;, &quot;*Buteridava&quot;, &quot;*Giridava&quot;, &quot;Dausadava&quot;, &quot;Kapidaua&quot;, &quot;Murideba&quot;, &quot;Sacidava&quot;, &quot;Scaidava&quot; (&quot;Skedeba&quot;), &quot;Sagadava&quot;, &quot;Sukidaua&quot; (&quot;Sucidava&quot;)10 names in total.
#In Upper Moesia (the districts of Nish, Sofia, and partly Kjustendil): &quot;Aiadaba&quot;, &quot;Bregedaba&quot;, &quot;Danedebai&quot;, &quot;Desudaba&quot;, &quot;Itadeba&quot;, &quot;Kuimedaba&quot;, &quot;Zisnudeba&quot;seven names in total.

&quot;Gil-doba&quot;, a village in Thracia, of unknown location.

&quot;Thermi-daua&quot;, a town in Dalmatia. Probably a Grecized form of &quot;*Germidava&quot;.

&quot;Pulpu-deva&quot;, (Phillipopolis) today Plovdiv in Bulgaria.

== Political entities ==

=== Rubobostes ===
Geto-Dacians inhabited both sides of the Tisa river prior to the rise of the Celtic Boii and again after the latter were defeated by the Dacians under the king Burebista. It seems likely that the Dacian state arose as a tribal confederacy, which was united only by charismatic leadership in both military-political and ideological-religious domains. At the beginning of the 2nd century BC, under the rule of Rubobostes, a Dacian king in present-day Transylvania, the Dacians&#x27; power in the Carpathian basin increased after they defeated the Celts, who previously held power in the region.

=== Oroles ===
A kingdom of Dacia also existed as early as the first half of the 2nd century BC under King Oroles. Conflicts with the Bastarnae and the Romans (112–109 BC, 74 BC), against whom they had assisted the Scordisci and Dardani, greatly weakened the resources of the Dacians.

=== Burebista ===
Burebista (Boerebista), a contemporary of Julius Caesar, ruled Geto-Dacian tribes between 82 BC and 44 BC. He thoroughly reorganised the army and attempted to raise the moral standard and obedience of the people by persuading them to cut their vines and give up drinking wine. During his reign, the Dacian Kingdom expanded to its maximum extent. The Bastarnae and Boii were conquered, and even the Greek towns of Olbia and Apollonia on the Black Sea (&quot;Pontus Euxinus&quot;) recognized Burebista&#x27;s authority. In 53 BC, Caesar stated that the Dacian territory was on the eastern border of the Hercynian Forest.

Burebista suppressed the indigenous minting of coinages by four major tribal groups, adopting imported or copied Roman denarii as a monetary standard. During his reign, Burebista transferred Geto-Dacians capital from Argedava to Sarmizegetusa Regia. For at least one and a half centuries, Sarmizegetusa was the Dacians&#x27; capital and reached its peak under King Decebalus. The Dacians appeared so formidable that Caesar contemplated an expedition against them, which his death in 44 BC prevented. In the same year, Burebista was murdered, and the kingdom was divided into four (later five) parts under separate rulers.

=== Cotiso ===
One of these entities was Cotiso&#x27;s state, to whom Augustus betrothed his own five-year-old daughter Julia. He is well known from the line in Horace (&quot;Occidit Daci Cotisonis agmen&quot;, Odes, III. 8. 18).

The Dacians are often mentioned under Augustus, according to whom they were compelled to recognize Roman supremacy. However they were by no means subdued, and in later times to maintain their independence they seized every opportunity to cross the frozen Danube during the winter and ravaging the Roman cities in the province of Moesia, which was under Roman occupation.

Strabo testified: &quot;although the Getae and Daci once attained to very great power, so that they actually could send forth an expedition of two hundred thousand men, they now find themselves reduced to as few as forty thousand, and they have come close to the point of yielding obedience to the Romans, though as yet they are not absolutely submissive, because of the hopes which they base on the Germans, who are enemies to the Romans.&quot;

In fact, this occurred because Burebista&#x27;s empire split after his death into four and later five smaller states, as Strabo explains, &quot;only recently, when Augustus Caesar sent an expedition against them, the number of parts into which the empire had been divided was five, though at the time of the insurrection it had been four. Such divisions, to be sure, are only temporary and vary with the times&quot;.

=== Decebalus ===
Decebalus ruled the Dacians between AD 87 and 106. The frontiers of Decebal&#x27;s Dacia were marked by the Tisa River to the west, by the trans-Carpathians to the north and by the Dniester River to the east. His name translates into &quot;strong as ten men&quot;.

== Roman conquest ==

When Trajan turned his attention to Dacia, it had been on the Roman agenda since before the days of Julius Caesar when a Roman army had been beaten at the Battle of Histria.

From AD 85 to 89, the Dacians under Decebalus were engaged in two wars with the Romans.

In AD 85, the Dacians had swarmed over the Danube and pillaged Moesia. In AD 87, the Roman troops sent by the Emperor Domitian against them under Cornelius Fuscus, were defeated and Cornelius Fuscus was killed by the Dacians by authority of their ruler, Diurpaneus. After this victory, Diurpaneus took the name of &quot;Decebalus&quot;, but the Romans were victorious in the Battle of Tapae in AD 88 and a truce was drawn up. The next year, AD 88, new Roman troops under Tettius Julianus, gained a significant advantage, but were obligated to make peace following the defeat of Domitian by the Marcomanni, leaving the Dacians effectively independent. Decebalus was given the status of &quot;king client to Rome&quot;, receiving military instructors, craftsmen and money from Rome. To Rome, Domitian brought Italian peasants in Dacian clothing because he couldn&#x27;t take slaves in the war.

To increase the glory of his reign, restore the finances of Rome, and end a treaty perceived as humiliating, Trajan resolved on the conquest of Dacia, the capture of the famous Treasure of Decebalus, and control over the Dacian gold mines of Transylvania. The result of his first campaign (101–102) was the siege of the Dacian capital Sarmizegethusa and the occupation of part of the country. Emperor Trajan recommenced hostilities against Dacia and, following an uncertain number of battles, and with Trajan&#x27;s troops pressing towards the Dacian capital Sarmizegethusa, Decebalus once more sought terms.
Decebalus rebuilt his power over the following years and attacked Roman garrisons again in AD 105. In response Trajan again marched into Dacia, attacking the Dacian capital in the Siege of Sarmizegethusa, and razing it to the ground; the defeated Dacian king Decebalus committed suicide to avoid capture. With part of Dacia quelled as the Roman province Dacia Traiana. Trajan subsequently invaded the Parthian empire to the east. His conquests brought the Roman Empire to its greatest extent. Rome&#x27;s borders in the east were governed indirectly in this period, through a system of client states, which led to less direct campaigning than in the west.

Some of the history of the war is given by Cassius Dio. Trajan erected the Column of Trajan in Rome to commemorate his victory.

===Provincial history===
Although the Romans conquered and destroyed the ancient Kingdom of Dacia, a large remainder of the land remained outside of Roman Imperial authority. Additionally, the conquest changed the balance of power in the region and was the catalyst for a renewed alliance of Germanic and Celtic tribes and kingdoms against the Roman Empire. However, the material advantages of the Roman Imperial system was attractive to the surviving aristocracy. Afterwards, many of the Dacians became Romanised (see also Origin of Romanians). In AD 183, war broke out in Dacia: few details are available, but it appears two future contenders for the throne of emperor Commodus, Clodius Albinus and Pescennius Niger, both distinguished themselves in the campaign.

According to Lactantius, the Roman emperor Decius (AD 249–251) had to restore Roman Dacia from the Carpo-Dacians of Zosimus &quot;having undertaken an expedition against the Carpi, who had then possessed themselves of Dacia and Moesia&quot;.
Even so, the Germanic and Celtic kingdoms, particularly the Gothic tribes, slowly moved toward the Dacian borders, and within a generation were making assaults on the province. Ultimately, the Goths succeeded in dislodging the Romans and restoring the &quot;independence&quot; of Dacia following Emperor Aurelian&#x27;s withdrawal, in 275.

In AD 268–269, at Naissus, Claudius II (Gothicus Maximus) obtained a decisive victory over the Goths. Since at that time Romans were still occupying Roman Dacia it is assumed that the Goths didn&#x27;t cross the Danube from the Roman province. The Goths who survived their defeat didn&#x27;t even attempt to escape through Dacia, but through Thrace. At the boundaries of Roman Dacia, Carpi (Free Dacians) were still strong enough to sustain five battles in eight years against the Romans from AD 301–308. Roman Dacia was left in AD 275 by the Romans, to the Carpi again, and not to the Goths. There were still Dacians in AD 336, against whom Constantine the Great fought.

The province was abandoned by Roman troops, and, according to the &quot;Breviarium historiae Romanae&quot; by Eutropius, Roman citizens &quot;from the towns and lands of Dacia&quot; were resettled to the interior of Moesia. Under Diocletian, c. AD 296, in order to defend the Roman border, fortifications were erected by the Romans on both banks of the Danube.

=== Late Roman Age (&quot;c.&quot; 270–&quot;c.&quot; 700)===

==== Constantinian reconquest ====

In 328 the emperor Constantine the Great inaugurated the Constantine&#x27;s Bridge (Danube) at Sucidava, (today Corabia in Romania) in hopes of reconquering Dacia, a province that had been abandoned under Aurelian. In the late winter of 332, Constantine campaigned with the Sarmatians against the Goths. The weather and lack of food cost the Goths dearly: reportedly, nearly one hundred thousand died before they submitted to Rome. In celebration of this victory Constantine took the title &quot;Gothicus Maximus&quot; and claimed the subjugated territory as the new province of Gothia. In 334, after Sarmatian commoners had overthrown their leaders, Constantine led a campaign against the tribe. He won a victory in the war and extended his control over the region, as remains of camps and fortifications in the region indicate. Constantine resettled some Sarmatian exiles as farmers in Illyrian and Roman districts, and conscripted the rest into the army. The new frontier in Dacia was along the Brazda lui Novac line supported by Castra of Hinova, Rusidava and Castra of Pietroasele. The limes passed to the north of Castra of Tirighina-Bărboși and ended at Sasyk Lagoon near the Dniester River. Constantine took the title &quot;Dacicus maximus&quot; in 336. 

Before 300, the Romans erected small forts at Dierna and in other places on the northern bank of the Danube in modern-day Banat. In their wider region, Roman coins from the periodmostly of bronzehave been found. The Huns destroyed Drobeta and Sucidava in the 440s, but the forts were restored under Emperor Justinian I (527–565). Eastern Roman coins from the first half of the 6th century suggest a significant military presence in Olteniaa region also characterized by the predominance of pottery with shapes of Roman tradition.

==== Scythia Minor ====

The territory between the Lower Danube and the Black Sea (today Dobrogea in Romania) remained a fully integrated part of the Roman Empire, even after the abandonment of Trajan&#x27;s Dacia. It was transformed into a separate province under the name of Scythia Minor around 293. 

The existence of Christian communities in Scythia Minor became evident under Emperor Diocletian (284–305). He and his co-emperors ordered the persecution of Christians throughout the empire, causing the death of many between 303 and 313. Under Emperor Constantine the Great (306–337), a bridge across the Danube was constructed at Sucidava, a new fort (Constantiana Daphne) was built, and ancient roads were repaired in Oltenia. The Lower Danube again became the empire&#x27;s northern boundary in 369 at the latest, when Emperor Valens met Athanaricthe head of the Gothsin a boat in the middle of the river because the latter had taken an oath &quot;never to set foot on Roman soil&quot;.

Although Eastern Roman emperors made annual payments to the neighboring peoples in an attempt to keep the peace in the Balkans, the Avars regularly invaded Scythia Minor from the 580s. The Romans abandoned Sucidava in 596 or 597, but Tomis, which was the last town in Scythia Minor to resist the invaders, only fell in 704.

====North of the &quot;limes&quot; (c. 270 – c. 330) ====
Transylvania and northern Banat, which belonged to Dacia before Trajan conquest, had no direct contact with the Roman Empire from the 270s. There is no evidence that they were invaded in the following decades. Towns, including Apulum and Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa, and the surrounding areas continued to be inhabited but the urban areas diminished. The existence of local Christian communities can be assumed in Porolissum, Potaissa and other settlements. On the other hand, evidencemainly pottery with &quot;Chi-rho&quot; &quot;(Χ-Ρ)&quot; signs and other Christian symbolsis &quot;shadowy and poorly understood&quot;, according to archaeologists Haynes and Hanson.

Urns found in late 3rd-century cemeteries at Bezid, Mediaş, and in other Transylvanian settlements had clear analogies in sites east of the Carpathians, suggesting that the Carpians were the first new arrivals in the former province from the neighboring regions. Other Carpian groups, pressured by the Goths, also departed from their homeland and sought refuge in the Roman Empire around 300. Nevertheless, &quot;Carpo-Dacians&quot; were listed among the peoples &quot;mixed with the Huns&quot; as late as 379. The Sarmatians of the Banat were allies of the empire, demonstrated by a Roman invasion in 332 against the Goths, their enemies. Sarmatians were admitted into the empire in 379, but other Sarmatian groups remained in the Tisa plains up until the 460s.

== Dacia after the Romans ==
The Victohali, Taifals, and Thervingians are tribes mentioned for inhabiting Dacia in 350, after the Romans left. Archeological evidence suggests that Gepids were disputing Transylvania with Taifals and Tervingians. Taifals, once independent from Gothia, became federati of the Romans, from whom they obtained the right to settle in Oltenia.

In 376, the region was conquered by Huns, who kept it until the death of Attila in 453. The Gepid tribe, ruled by Ardaric, used it as their base, until in 566, when it was destroyed by the Lombards. Lombards abandoned the country and the Avars (second half of the 6th century) dominated the region for 230 years, until their kingdom was destroyed by Charlemagne in 791. At the same time, Slavic people arrived.

== The name&#x27;s usage in modern culture ==
S.C. Automobile Dacia S.A., also known as Dacia, is a Romanian car manufacturer that takes its name from the historical kingdom. It is Romania&#x27;s largest company by revenue, and sells its products mainly in Europe and North Africa.

<text>The Carpathian Mountains or Carpathians () are a range of mountains forming an arc across Central Europe and Southeast Europe. Roughly long, it is the third-longest European mountain range after the Urals at and the Scandinavian Mountains at . The range stretches from the eastern edge of the Czech Republic (3%) and Austria (1%) in the northwest through Slovakia (21%), Poland (10%), Ukraine (10%), Romania (50%) to Serbia (5%) in the south. The highest range within the Carpathians is the Tatra Mountains: the highest peaks in Slovakia exceed . The second-highest range is the Southern Carpathians in Romania, where the highest peaks range between and .

The divisions of the Carpathians usually involve three major sections:

* Western Carpathians: eastern Austria, eastern Czechia, southern Poland and Slovakia
* Eastern Carpathians: southeastern Poland, northeastern Slovakia, southwestern Ukraine, and Romania
* Southern Carpathians: Romania and eastern Serbia

The term Outer Carpathians is frequently used to describe the northern rim of the Western and Eastern Carpathians.

The Carpathians provide habitat for the largest European populations of brown bears, wolves, chamois, and lynxes, with the highest concentration in Romania, as well as over one-third of all European plant species. The mountains and their foothills also have many thermal and mineral waters, with Romania having one-third of the European total. Romania is likewise home to the second-largest area of virgin forests in Europe after Russia, totaling 250,000 hectares (65%), most of them in the Carpathians, with the Southern Carpathians constituting Europe&#x27;s largest unfragmented forest area. Deforestation rates due to illegal logging in the Carpathians are high.

==Name==
In modern times, the range is called in Czech, Polish and Slovak and in Ukrainian, / in Serbo-Croatian, in Romanian, in Rusyn, in German and in Hungarian. Although the toponym was recorded by Ptolemy in the second century AD, the modern form of the name is a neologism in most languages. For instance, &quot;Havasok&quot; (&quot;Snowy Mountains&quot;) was its medieval Hungarian name. Russian chronicles referred to it as &quot;Hungarian Mountains&quot;. Later sources, such as Dimitrie Cantemir and the Italian chronicler Giovanandrea Gromo, referred to the range as &quot;Transylvania&#x27;s Mountains&quot;, while the 17th-century historian Constantin Cantacuzino translated the name of the mountains in an Italian-Romanian glossary to &quot;Rumanian Mountains&quot;.

The name &quot;Carpates&quot; is highly associated with the old Dacian tribes called &quot;Carpes&quot; or &quot;Carpi&quot; who lived in an area to the east of the Carpathians, from the east, northeast of the Black Sea to the Transylvanian Plain in the present day Romania and Moldova. &quot;Karpates&quot; is considered a Paleo-Balkan name, with evidence provided by the Albanian &quot;kárpë / kárpa&quot;, pl. &quot;kárpa / kárpat&quot; (&#x27;rock, stiff&#x27;), and the Messapic &quot;karpa&quot; &#x27;tuff (rock), limestone&#x27; (preserved as &quot;càrpë&quot; &#x27;tuff&#x27; in Bitonto dialect and &quot;càrparu&quot; &#x27;limestone&#x27; in Salentino). This connection is further supported by the fact that also the oronym &quot;Beskydy&quot;, a series of mountain ranges in the Carpathians, has a meaning in Albanian: &quot;bjeshkë / bjeshkët&quot; &#x27;high mountains, mountain pastures&#x27; (cf. also the Albanian oronym &quot;Bjeshkët e Namuna&quot;, the Accursed Mountains / Albanian Alps).

The name &quot;Carpates&quot; may ultimately be from the Proto Indo-European root &quot;*sker-&quot;/&quot;*ker-&quot;, which meant mountain, rock, or rugged (cf. Albanian &quot;kárpë&quot;, Germanic root &quot;*skerp-&quot;, Old Norse &quot;harrow&quot;, Gothic &quot;skarpo&quot;, Middle Low German &quot;scharf&quot; &quot;potsherd&quot;, and Modern High German &quot;Scherbe&quot; &quot;shard&quot;, Lithuanian &quot;kar~pas&quot; &quot;cut, hack, notch&quot;, Latvian &quot;cìrpt&quot; &quot;to shear, clip&quot;). The archaic Polish word &quot;karpa&quot; meant &#x27;rugged irregularities, underwater obstacles/rocks, rugged roots, or trunks&#x27;. The more common word &quot;skarpa&quot; means a sharp cliff or other vertical terrain, cf..Old English and English &quot;sharp&quot;. The name may instead come from Indo-European * &#x27;to turn&#x27;, akin to Old English &#x27;to turn, change&#x27; (English &quot;warp&quot;) and Greek &#x27;wrist&#x27;, perhaps referring to the way the mountain range bends or veers in an L-shape.

In late Roman documents, the Eastern Carpathian Mountains were referred to as &quot;Montes Sarmatici&quot; (meaning Sarmatian Mountains). The Western Carpathians were called &quot;Carpates&quot;, a name that is first recorded in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geographia&quot; (second century AD).

In the Scandinavian &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;, which relates ancient Germanic legends about battles between Goths and Huns, the name &quot;Karpates&quot; appears in the predictable Germanic form as &quot;Harvaða fjöllum&quot; (see Grimm&#x27;s law).

&quot;Inter Alpes Huniae et Oceanum est Polonia&quot; (&quot;Between the Hunic Alps and the ocean lies Poland&quot;) by Gervase of Tilbury, was described in his &quot;Otia Imperialia&quot; (&quot;Recreation for an Emperor&quot;) in 1211. Thirteenth- to fifteenth-century Hungarian documents named the mountains &quot;Thorchal&quot;, &quot;Tarczal&quot;, or less frequently &quot;Montes Nivium&quot; (&quot;Snowy Mountains&quot;).

== Geography ==
The northwestern Carpathians begin in Slovakia and southern Poland. They surround Transcarpathia and Transylvania in a large semicircle, sweeping towards the southeast, and end on the Danube near Orșova in Romania. The total length of the Carpathians is over . The mountain chain&#x27;s width varies between . The highest altitudes of the Carpathians occur where they are widest. The system attains its greatest breadth in the Transylvanian plateau and in the southern Tatra Mountains group – the highest range, in which Gerlachovský štít in Slovakia is the highest peak, is above sea level. The Carpathians cover an area of . After the Alps, they form the next-most extensive mountain system in Europe.

Although commonly referred to as a mountain chain, the Carpathians do not form an uninterrupted chain of mountains. Rather, they consist of several orographically and geologically distinctive groups, presenting as great a structural variety as the Alps. The Carpathians, which attain an altitude over in only a few places, lack the bold peaks, extensive snowfields, large glaciers, high waterfalls, and numerous large lakes that are common in the Alps. It was believed that no area of the Carpathian range was covered in snow all year round and there were no glaciers, but recent research by Polish scientists discovered one permafrost and glacial area in the Tatra Mountains.

The Carpathians at their highest altitude are only as high as the middle region of the Alps, with which they share a common appearance, climate, and flora. The Carpathians are separated from the Alps by the Danube. The two ranges meet at only one point: the Leitha Mountains at Bratislava. The river also separates them from the Balkan Mountains at Orșova in Romania. The valley of the March and Oder separates the Carpathians from the Silesian and Moravian chains, which belong to the middle wing of the great Central Mountain System of Europe.

Unlike the other wings of the system, the Carpathians, which form the watershed between the northern seas and the Black Sea, are surrounded on all sides by plains. The Pannonian plain is to the southwest, the Lower Danubian Plain to the south, with the southern part being in Bulgaria, and the northern – in (Romania), and the Galician plain to the northeast.

===Mountain passes===
In the Romanian part of the main chain of the Carpathians, mountain passes include Prislop Pass, Tihuța Pass, Bicaz Canyon, Ghimeș Pass, Buzău Pass, Predeal Pass (crossed by the railway from Brașov to Bucharest), Turnu Roșu Pass (1,115 ft., running through the narrow gorge of the Olt River and crossed by the railway from Sibiu to Bucharest), Vulcan Pass, and the Iron Gate (both crossed by the railway from Timișoara to Craiova).

== Geology ==
The area now occupied by the Carpathians was once occupied by smaller ocean basins. The Carpathian mountains were formed during the Alpine orogeny in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic by moving the ALCAPA (Alpine-Carpathian-Pannonian), Tisza and Dacia plates over subducting oceanic crust. The mountains take the form of a fold and thrust belt with generally north vergence in the western segment, northeast to east vergence in the eastern portion and southeast vergence in the southern portion. Currently, the area is the most seismically active in Central Europe.

The external, generally northern, portion of the orogenic belt is a Tertiary accretionary wedge of a so-called Flysch belt (the Carpathian Flysch Belt) created by rocks scraped off the sea bottom and thrust over the North-European plate. The Carpathian accretionary wedge is made of several thin skinned nappes composed of Cretaceous to Paleogene turbidites. Thrusting of the Flysch nappes over the Carpathian foreland caused the formation of the Carpathian foreland basin. The boundary between the Flysch belt and internal zones of the orogenic belt in the western segment of the mountain range is marked by the Pieniny Klippen Belt, a narrow complicated zone of polyphase compressional deformation, later involved in a supposed strike-slip zone.

Internal zones in western and eastern segments contain older Variscan igneous massifs reworked in Mesozoic thick and thin-skinned nappes. During the Middle Miocene this zone was affected by intensive calc-alkaline arc volcanism that developed over the subduction zone of the flysch basins. At the same time, the internal zones of the orogenic belt were affected by large extensional structure of the back-arc Pannonian Basin. The last volcanic activity occurred at Ciomadul about 30,000 years ago.

The mountains started to gain their current shape from the latest Miocene onward. The slopes of the Carphartian contain at some locations solifluction deposits.

Iron, gold and silver were found in great quantities in the Western Carpathians. After the Roman emperor Trajan&#x27;s conquest of Dacia, he brought back to Rome over 165 tons of gold and 330 tons of silver.

==Ecology==
The ecology of the Carpathians varies with altitude, ranging from lowland forests to alpine meadows. Foothill forests are primarily of broadleaf deciduous trees, including oak, hornbeam, and linden. European beech is characteristic of the montane forest zone. Higher-elevation subalpine forests are characterized by Norway spruce (&quot;Picea abies&quot;). Krummholz and alpine meadows occur above the treeline.

Wildlife in the Carpathians includes brown bear (&quot;Ursus arctos&quot;), wolf (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;), Eurasian lynx (&quot;Lynx lynx&quot;), European wildcat (&quot;Felis silvestris&quot;), Tatra chamois (&quot;Rupicapra rupicapra tatrica&quot;), European bison (&quot;Bison bonasus&quot;), and golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;).

==Divisions of the Carpathians==

The range with the highest peaks is the Tatras in Slovakia and Poland. A major part of the western and northeastern Outer Eastern Carpathians in Poland, Ukraine, and Slovakia is traditionally called the Eastern Beskids. Romania comprises roughly 50% of the Carpathian chain where the rest of the highest peaks, above 2500m (in the Southern Carpathians) are found.

The geological border between the Western and Eastern Carpathians runs approximately along the line (south to north) between the towns of Michalovce, Bardejov, Nowy Sącz and Tarnów. In older systems the border runs more in the east, along the line (north to south) along the rivers San and Osława (Poland), the town of Snina (Slovakia) and river Tur&#x27;ia (Ukraine). Biologists shift the border even further to the east.

The border between the eastern and southern Carpathians is formed by the Predeal Pass, south of Brașov and the Prahova Valley.

In geopolitical terms, Carpathian Mountains are often grouped and labeled according to national or regional borders, but such division has turned out to be relative, since it was, and still is dependent on frequent historical, political and administrative changes of national or regional borders. According to modern geopolitical division, Carpathians can be grouped as: Serbian, Romanian, Ukrainian, Polish, Slovakian, Czech and Austrian. Within each nation, specific classifications of the Carpathians have been developing, often reflecting local traditions, and thus creating terminological diversity, that produces various challenges in the fields of comparative classification and international systematization.

The section of the Carpathians within the borders of Romania is commonly known as the Romanian Carpathians. In local use, Romanians sometimes denote as &quot;Eastern Carpathians&quot; only the Romanian part of the Eastern Carpathians, which lies on their territory (i.e., from the Ukrainian border or from the Prislop Pass to the south), which they subdivide into three simplified geographical groups (northern, central, southern), instead of Outer and Inner Eastern Carpathians. These groups are:

* Maramureș-Bukovinian Carpathians (Romanian: &quot;Carpații Maramureșului și ai Bucovinei&quot;)
* Moldavian-Transylvanian Carpathians (Romanian: &quot;Carpații Moldo-Transilvani&quot;)
* Curvature Carpathians (Romanian: &quot;Carpații Curburii, Carpații de Curbură&quot;)

The section of the Carpathians within the borders of Ukraine is commonly known as the Ukrainian Carpathians. Classification of eastern sections of the Carpathians is particularly complex, since it was influenced by several overlapping traditions. Terms like
Wooded Carpathians, Poloniny Mountains or Eastern Beskids are often used in varying scopes by authors belonging to different traditions.

<doc id="45747" wikidata="Q2518402" url="?curid=45747" title="Weapons in Star Trek">
<text>The &quot;Star Trek&quot; fictional universe contains a variety of weapons, ranging from missiles (photon torpedoes) to melee (primarily used by the Klingons, a race of aliens in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe). The &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise consists mainly of several multi-season television shows and thirteen movies, as well as various video games and merchandise. Many aspects of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe impact modern popular culture, especially its fictitious terminology and the concept of weaponry on spacecraft. The franchise has had a widespread influence on its audiences from the late 20th to early 21st century. Notably, &quot;Star Trek&quot;&#x27;s science fiction concepts have been studied by real scientists; NASA described it in relation to the real world as &quot;entertaining combination of real science, imaginary science gathered from lots of earlier stories, and stuff the writers make up week-by-week to give each new episode novelty.&quot; For example, NASA noted that the &quot;Star Trek&quot; &quot;phasers&quot; were a fictional extrapolation of real-life lasers, and compared them to real-life microwave based weapons that have a stunning effect.

==Energy weapons==
The franchise depicts various weapons which fit the motif of the raygun, the most prominent of these being the &quot;phaser&quot;. These directed-energy weapons emit energy rather than a projectile. A hand phaser can be set to &quot;stun&quot; or &quot;kill&quot;.

===Phaser===

Phasers are common and versatile phased array pulsed energy projectile weapons, first seen in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series and later in almost all subsequent films and television spin-offs. Phasers range in size from small arms to starship-mounted weaponry.

Phaser output can be adjusted in both area of effect and output: a typical hand phaser can be adjusted so that it will merely shock or stun a living organism, while the effects of higher settings range from burning, disintegration, or to true vaporization. This versatility means they can also be used as welding torches or cutting tools, and can create heat sources by firing at a large, solid object (like a rock). The stream can be adjusted to strike multiple targets at once, strike a single target with precision, or even destroy large amounts of material. Phasers can be set to overload, whereby they build up a force-chamber explosion by continuously generating energy without releasing it; the resulting blast can destroy most natural objects within a radius. The overload process is marked by a distinctive sound that increases in volume and frequency until it is deactivated or it detonates. Personal phasers can be made small enough to fit in the user&#x27;s palm and still be lethal. Larger and more powerful phaser rifles are issued to security personnel.

Ship-mounted phasers have a similar range of functions on a larger scale: The phasers on the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; can be used as an &quot;anti-missile&quot; defense to destroy incoming projectiles, stun entire city blocks full of people, destroy cities, and even destroy entire asteroids up to a given size. The ship&#x27;s phaser system is also said to be capable of destroying continents.

Although starships are frequently shown firing their phasers while at Warp speeds across the various Star Trek series, this was generally avoided during &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, and the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual&quot; states that it is impossible. The &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual&quot;, on the other hand, describes an &quot;ACB-jacketed beam device&quot; as the mechanism which allows phasers to function at Warp speeds.

According to later series, phasers release a beam of fictional subatomic particles called &quot;rapid nadion&quot;, which are then refracted (&quot;rectified&quot;) through superconducting crystals. The &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual&quot; indicates that the superconducting crystals used in phasers are called , which is Japanese for &quot;sea of mystery&quot;, and the phrase is written in the original glyphs. This was a homage to the 1990 anime series &quot;&quot;, known in North America as &quot;Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water&quot;.

The phasers in the 2009 reboot film &quot;Star Trek&quot; appear similar in shape to the classic phasers, but fire singular energy pulses instead of a sustained stream of them, in a fashion similar to semi-automatic weapons. This version of the phaser has two settings, stun and kill, which fire blue and red colored pulses respectively. The barrel of the weapon is two-sided, one being colored red and the other blue to indicate the current setting; the user must manually rotate to the other output to use the other setting. A similar change is seen in the starship-mounted phaser banks, which also fire single energy pulse instead of continuous streams. In &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot;, the barrel sides of the sidearm phasers are flat and both barrels shoot blue bolts that deal no physical damage, while the barrel tips are still colored blue and red.

The original phaser rifle prop from &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; sold at auction in 2013 for $231,000.

===Laser===
Lasers are a sidearm in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; pilot &quot;The Cage&quot;, and laser pistols appear in several &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; (&quot;TOS&quot;) episodes, although later episodes in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (&quot;TNG&quot;) indicate that the laser&#x27;s use as a weapon is outdated. In one instance, the ship-mounted lasers of two spacecraft were incapable of overcoming the navigational shields of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D, though on two other occasions it is threatened with destruction by a laser-armed spacecraft. The Borg cutter weapon is a laser, as mentioned in the &quot;TNG&quot; episode &quot;Q Who&quot; and is capable of quickly disintegrating the hull of a Federation starship, as seen in the pilot episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, &quot;Emissary&quot;. At lower power levels, it is capable of making &quot;surgical&quot; incisions into a ship&#x27;s hull.

According to &quot;The Making of Star Trek&quot;, Gene Roddenberry claimed that production staff realized using laser technology would cause problems in the future, as people came to understand what lasers could and could not do. This resulted in the move to phasers on-screen, while letting lasers be known as a more primitive weapon style.

===Plasma cannon===
Plasma cannons are a form of directed energy weaponry used by both Earth Starfleet and the early Romulan Star Empire. On Starfleet vessels, they are the precursors to phase cannons. Plasma cannons fire a plasma discharge in the form of a beam or a burst, similar to the plasma bullets fired by hand-held plasma weapons, but much bigger in size. The NX-class is initially armed with plasma cannons.

===Phase cannon===
Phase cannons are 22nd century weapons, several of which first appear mounted to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; in the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;Silent Enemy&quot;. Phase cannons have a variable yield, with the cannons on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; being rated for a maximum output of 500 gigajoules, equivalent to about 120 tons of TNT. Phase cannons are generally more powerful than spatial torpedoes. They are the 22nd century precursor to phaser technology, in addition to phase pistols (hand-carried phase cannons). Unlike 24th century phasers, they do not have the normal variable power settings or a variable beam width – only stun and kill.

===Disruptor===
Disruptors are employed by several alien species in this series, including Romulans, Klingons, Breen, Cardassians, Iridians and Orions in their personal and military small arms as well as being mounted as cannon, emitters, turrets, and banks. Only the first three species are known to have type-3 disruptors, the most advanced type developed by the 24th Century. Disruptors cause damage by exciting the molecular bonds of targets to such great extents that those bonds are weakened and/or broken by the energies emitted, which often manifest as an explosive force. According to Last Unicorn&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation Role-playing Game&quot;, disruptors are considered less &quot;elegant&quot; than phaser-based weapons; their effects there are described as thermal shock and blunt force, as opposed to the &quot;rapid nadion effect&quot;. As a result, disruptors inflict more damage to matter, but less damage to shields, than phasers. Klingons call their disruptors &quot;nISwI&quot;&#x27;.

===Phased polaron cannon===
Phased polaron cannons are the primary armament of the Dominion, the main antagonist faction in the later seasons of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. The cannon emits a beam of polaron particles, the fictional in-universe antimatter counterpart of the muon (not to be confused with the actual polaron or the actual antimuon). When first introduced, Dominion polaron cannons easily penetrate the shielding systems of most Alpha Quadrant races. The Alpha Quadrant races eventually learn to modify their shields to resist polaron weaponry (&quot;Call to Arms&quot;).

===Tetryon cannon===
Tetryon cannons are the primary armament of the Hirogen and are similar in application to phasers and disruptors. Tetryon cannons are unique in that they are designed primarily to damage energy and force fields, such as starship shields. Tetryon cannons damage matter, but not to the same extent as phasers or disruptors. This is in line with the Hirogen philosophy of the hunt, as depicted in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; (&quot;VOY&quot;). The Hirogen ship would therefore knock out its opponent&#x27;s shields and beam over hunters to engage in face-to-face ranged or melee combat. This allows the Hirogen hunters to collect items that they would consider to be hunting trophies.

===Varon-T disruptor===
Varon-T disruptors are featured in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (&quot;TNG&quot;) episode &quot;The Most Toys&quot;, and are mentioned to be a rare type of disruptor that are illegal in the Federation because of their slow, excruciating method of killing, with the weapons tearing the body apart from the inside. Kivas Fajo, a Zibalian trader in that episode, owns four of the five Varon-T disruptors ever manufactured (he sleeps with one under his pillow) and uses one on his own crew before his collection of rare items was confiscated after his capture and arrest for kidnapping and theft (among other crimes). The fifth Varon-T was kept by the criminal Kelsey who was killed when her scout ship exploded.

===Ferengi energy whip===
The Ferengi energy whip, as seen in the &quot;TNG&quot; episode &quot;The Last Outpost&quot;, looks and handles like a typical bullwhip and discharges a powerful phaser-like energy pulse.

==Projectile weapons==

===Spatial torpedo===
Also referred to as conventional torpedoes, spatial torpedoes are 22nd century weapons used by &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Spatial torpedoes are the ship&#x27;s most powerful and primary ship-to-ship weapon before the installation of phase cannons. Spatial torpedoes are themselves superseded by more powerful photonic torpedoes. Unlike photonic torpedoes or any of the warhead&#x27;s successors, spatial torpedoes are launched at sub-light velocity and can be used much in the manner of a missile, having the warhead on a fly-by-wire.

===Photon torpedo===
Photon torpedoes are a standard ship-based weapon armed with an antimatter warhead. They are present in every version of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series and are a standard weapon on almost every Federation ship, though in &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; (&quot;ENT&quot;), the titular ship uses less powerful spatial torpedoes (guided, rocket propelled missiles) until receiving the more powerful &quot;photonic&quot; variant. Photon torpedoes first appear on a Starfleet ship in the original series&#x27; episode &quot;Arena&quot; as part of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s armament. In the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;The Expanse&quot;, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; (NX-01) first receives photonic torpedoes. Smaller Starfleet craft such as shuttlecraft and runabouts can be armed with &quot;micro-torpedoes&quot;, a scaled-down version of photon torpedoes designed for use on craft too small to accommodate the full-sized weapon.

When fired, photon torpedoes usually appear as a spiky orb of energy of varying colours, such as red, orange, yellow, blue, or green, or in the case of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; (&quot;TOS&quot;), red bolts. According to the original notes to &quot;TOS&quot; and &quot;The Making of Star Trek&quot;, photon torpedoes are energy shielded to allow armor-penetration. Several episodes seem to suggest this (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;Suspicions&quot;). The energy output of a photon torpedo, according to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; Technical Manuals is a maximum theoretical yield of 25 isotons and a maximum rated yield of 18.5 isotons. According to &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual&quot;, photon torpedoes use of matter and the same amount of antimatter. In the &quot;TOS&quot; episode, &quot;Balance of Terror&quot;, photon torpedoes had replaced nuclear warheads as the primary wartime weapons on Federation starships.

Torpedoes are often depicted as being easy to modify to suit specific situations. Despite the stated maximum yield, torpedoes can be made far more destructive with relatively little effort. In &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, Tuvok and Kim modify a normal photon torpedo with a gravimetric charge, a piece of Borg technology, to increase its destructive yield to 54 isotons. Kim comments that 50 isotons would be sufficient to destroy a small planet. Janeway later instructs them to increase its yield to 80 isotons. In &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;, Spock and Dr. McCoy modify a photon torpedo to track the plasma emissions from a cloaked Klingon bird of prey as it attacks the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-A and the &quot;Excelsior&quot;, similar to the principal function of a heat-seeking missile.

Photon torpedo launchers aboard ships are shown to be able to fire probes, which, in-universe, are designed with this functionality in mind. In &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, a torpedo casing is used as a makeshift coffin for burial in space and as scientific probes as in the &quot;TNG&quot; episode &quot;In Theory&quot; and in &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;.

===Plasma torpedo===
Plasma torpedoes are used by the Romulans, Cardassians, and (according to &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot;, &quot;Klingon Academy&quot; and &quot;Starfleet Command&quot;) the Gorn. The damage of a plasma torpedo spreads out over several ship systems at once, but the torpedo loses its effectiveness after only a few minutes of travel. Romulan plasma torpedoes use trilithium isotopes in their warheads.

===Gravimetric torpedoes===
Gravimetric torpedoes are torpedoes used by the Borg. The weapon emits a complex phase variance of gravitons to create a gravimetric distortion capable of tearing starships apart.

===Quantum torpedo===
Quantum torpedoes first appear in the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Defiant&quot; as a weapon aboard the . In the &quot;DS9&quot; episode &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, the USS &quot;Lakota&quot; was also stated to be carrying quantum torpedoes, although they were never used. Additionally, the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E is equipped with quantum torpedoes in &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;. The Federation are the only known users of quantum torpedoes. The &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual&quot; states that quantum torpedoes derive their destructive power from vacuum energy. Various in-universe sources describe quantum torpedoes as roughly double the destructive power of standard photon torpedoes, putting their yield somewhere in excess of 100 megatons of TNT.

Four of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E&#x27;s quantum torpedoes destroyed an unshielded Borg sphere. The launcher appears on the 1701-E in &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot; but is never fired. In &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;, nine of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E&#x27;s quantum torpedoes disable the &quot;Scimitar&quot;″s cloaking function.

Quantum torpedoes are normally shown in a shade of blue. As of &quot;Nemesis&quot; the following ship classes have quantum torpedoes launcher; &quot;Defiant&quot;–, &quot;Intrepid&quot;–, &quot;Luna&quot;–, &quot;Sovereign&quot;–, &quot;Vesta&quot;– , &quot;Akira&quot;– and &quot;Achilles&quot;–class. In addition to the uncrewed Cardassian spacecraft &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, these are the only ships known to be equipped with quantum torpedoes. Though Dreadnought only has quantum torpedoes due to the maquis acquiring them illicitly, along with their other military grade weapons. B&#x27;elanna Torres installed the quantum torpedoes on Dreadnought to increase its armament from the original complement.

===Polaron torpedo===
Polaron torpedoes, like the Dominion weapon, are capable of penetrating normal shielding with ease. They appear in various &quot;Star Trek&quot; games. In &quot;Starfleet Command III&quot;, it is one of the Klingon&#x27;s three heavy weapon options, the others being the photon torpedo and the ion cannon. It also appears in &quot;Star Trek: Armada&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Armada II&quot;, as a researchable weapon for the Klingon Empire exclusive to the &quot;Vor&#x27;cha&quot;-class cruiser which takes out one of the targeted ship&#x27;s systems at random.

===Transphasic torpedo===
Transphasic torpedoes appear only once, in the &quot;Voyager&quot; series finale, &quot;Endgame&quot;. They are high-yield torpedoes that are designed specifically to fight the Borg. The future Admiral Janeway brought them back in time in a Federation shuttlecraft and had them installed onboard &quot;Voyager&quot; in 2378. They are among the most powerful weapons used in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe; just one is capable of obliterating an entire Borg cube. They work by delivering destructive subspace compression pulse explosion. Upon detonation the pulse is delivered in asymmetric superposition of multiple phase states. Since the shields can block only one subcomponent of the pulse the remaining majority is delivered to the target. On the top of it every torpedo has different transphasic configuration generated randomly by a dissonant feedback effect to prevent Borg or any other enemy to predict the configuration of the phase states. Although they do not appear in the film &quot;Nemesis&quot;, according to the non-canon &quot;Destiny&quot; book trilogy these are kept by Starfleet as the weapon of last resort to be deployed to starships only when all else had failed against the Borg. Eventually, the situation becomes dire enough that the specifications are released to Federation and Klingon ships; the Borg eventually learn to adapt to them.

===Isokinetic cannon===
The Isokinetic cannon was seen in only one episode of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, &quot;Retrospect&quot;. In the episode, representatives of USS &quot;Voyager&quot; meet with a weapons trader and designer known as Kovin. The demonstration of the weapon destroys a target buoy composed of 10 m thick solid monotanium with a chromoelectric forcefield in one shot, coring it cleanly through.

===TR-116 projectile rifle===
The TR-116 projectile rifle is a prototype weapon developed by the Federation for situations where conventional energy weapons might be rendered useless by damping fields or other countermeasures. It is introduced in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Field of Fire&quot;, where it is used in conjunction with a micro-transporter and a visual scanner headpiece to create an extremely potent sniper rifle. With the scanner, the shooter can precisely target people hundreds of meters away and through solid matter with no difficulty. Using the transporter attached to the barrel, the slug can then be transported during motion at full velocity, thus traveling through walls and materializing within point-blank range of the target.

===Phased plasma torpedo===
Phased plasma torpedoes can phase out of normal space-time to bypass shields, then phase back in to detonate on a ship&#x27;s hull, thus making shields worthless against them. They only appear in the PC game &quot;Star Trek: Bridge Commander&quot;. Shortly after the recovery of the Pegasus device, the phasing properties used in the design are seen as a delivery system for torpedoes. Reducing the size of the phasing coils used to accomplish an intangible state proves difficult. Further, the antimatter within the warhead has a destabilizing effect on the phasing coil. A new kind of explosive material is needed, and it is found using the principles behind the first observed Romulan plasma weapons. The installation of a high-energy plasma infuser allows a torpedo casing to be filled with a warhead charged with high-energy plasma from the ship&#x27;s warp nacelles. Warp plasma is highly unstable and can be easily detonated. Using a nanite-controlled trigger for reactant release allows vessels to deliver a high-energy plasma warhead payload within a Mark IV torpedo casing.

===Chroniton torpedo===
Chroniton torpedoes are a unique form of weapon employed by the Krenim. The weapons phase in and out of normal time, allowing them to pass through ordinary shields and directly damage a vessel&#x27;s hull. Though dangerous, their reliability is not absolute, as Seven of Nine and Tuvok (as well as Kes in the alternate timeline presented in &quot;Before and After&quot;) find an undetonated chroniton torpedo lodged in &quot;Voyager&quot;″s hull, which in turn allow the crew to adapt the shields to withstand further attacks.

===Positron torpedo===
The Kessok are a highly intelligent race that ally themselves with the Cardassians, albeit through deceit, in the video game &quot;Star Trek: Bridge Commander&quot;. They utilize positron torpedoes: powerful, slow-moving projectiles able to inflict nearly twice as much damage as quantum torpedoes.

==Biological, radioactive, and chemical weapons==

===Thalaron radiation===
Thalaron radiation was first used in the feature film &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; by the villain Shinzon to assassinate the entire Romulan senate. Later in the movie, Shinzon attempts to kill the crew of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E using a ship-mounted version. Thalaron radiation, even in small amounts, petrifies living tissue almost instantly. Its properties also allow its range and area of effect to be precisely controlled, from encompassing a single room to engulfing an entire planet. Its massive destructive potential leads the Federation to consider it an extremely illegal biogenic weapon. It later features prominently in the plot of &quot;Homecoming&quot;, the &quot;Star Trek: New Frontier&quot; short story in the 2008 Mirror Universe anthology &quot;Shards and Shadows&quot;, in which the rebels manage to steal a Romulan thalaron bomb intended for use by the Alliance, to strike a balance of power against them.

===Metreon cascade===
The metreon cascade was designed by Dr. Ma&#x27;Bor Jetrel of the Haakonian Order. Unstable metreon isotopes are used to create a devastating explosion, with radiation effects similar to those of the 20th-century atomic bomb. Those not killed or vaporized in the initial blast suffer radiation poisoning and death in the aftermath. It is used only once, on the Talaxian moon Rinax in 2355.

===Trilithium resin===

Trilithium resin is a byproduct of a starship&#x27;s warp engines that is lethal to humans, but harmless to Cardassians. A team of terrorists attempted to steal Trilithium resin from the warp core of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D when it was docked at Arkaria Station to receive a baryon sweep.

Captain Benjamin Sisko would later use a Trilithium resin torpedo to render a Maquis planet uninhabitable to all human life for fifty years by detonating it in the atmosphere.

===Cobalt diselenide===

Cobalt diselenide is a biogenic weapon that affects the nervous system. It is composed of selenium and rhodium nitrates. It is the counterpart to trilithium resin, being lethal to Cardassians but harmless to most other humanoids.

===Aceton assimilators===
Aceton assimilators are used to absorb energy from other sources and then redirect it back as hazardous radiation.

==Melee weapons==

===Federation===

====KaBar combat knife====
The KaBar combat knife is the Federation&#x27;s standard-issue combat and survival knife. It is 32.5 cm (12.8 in) and is standard equipment in survival gear and in emergency weapons caches aboard starships. Captain Kathryn Janeway uses one in the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Macrocosm&quot;.

In the real world, the KA-BAR is an official combat knife of the United States Marine Corps.

====Katana====
A katana is a Federation sword of Japanese origin. The only major difference is that the &quot;Star Trek&quot; version is foldable, thus occupying a minimum space when carried and stored. In the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; reboot, Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu produces a folding katana with which to cut the lines of his parachute.

===Jem&#x27;Hadar===

====Bayonet====
The Jem&#x27;Hadar often have bayonets attached to their plasma (also known as polaron-pulse) rifles. They employ these in close combat, or to execute prisoners. Often Jem&#x27;Hadar bayonets are chemically enhanced, releasing a lethal nerve-agent on contact.

====Kar&#x27;takin====
Kar&#x27;takin are straight-bladed polearms used by the Jem&#x27;Hadar in close combat. They are used by both Starfleet officers and Jem&#x27;Hadar in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;To the Death&quot;. The Kar&#x27;takin bear a resemblance to the Bardiche axe.

====Shock Blade====
In the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: The Fallen&quot; video game, this weapon delivers a taser-like jolt to whatever it strikes in combat. Holding the shock blade&#x27;s trigger discharges a beam of neuro-electrical energy, with an effective range of 15 feet.

===Klingon===

====Bat&#x27;leth (AKA betleH)====

The bat&#x27;leth is the Klingon double-sided scimitar/hook sword/lujiaodao hybrid–edge weapon, designed by martial arts enthusiast and &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; effects producer Dan Curry. The bat&#x27;leth is a curved blade with spiked protrusions and handholds along the middle of the blade&#x27;s back. In battle, the handholds are used to twirl and spin the blade rapidly.

Klingon oral history holds that the first bat&#x27;leth was forged around 625 A.D. by Kahless, who dropped a lock of his hair into the lava from the Kri&#x27;stak Volcano, then plunged the fiery lock into the lake of Lursor and twisted it to form a blade. After forging the weapon, he used it to defeat the tyrant Molor, and in doing so united the Klingon homeworld. This first bat&#x27;leth is known as the Sword of Kahless&#x27; and was stolen by the invading Hur&#x27;q; an episode of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; revolves around an effort to recover the Sword of Kahless. The name &quot;bat&#x27;leth&quot; itself is a slight corruption of , which means &quot;Sword of Honor&quot; in Klingon.

A &quot;Valdris&quot; blade was used in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in two 7-Eleven armed-robberies in 2009.

====Chon&#x27;naq (AKA chonnaQ)====
A smaller version of this &quot;belly–spear&quot; (the literal Klingon translation) is used in the children&#x27;s game of , which incorporates spinning hoops, and hones assorted skills needed for hunting. Once a male Klingon reaches the Age of Ascension, he is presented with an adult version of the chon&#x27;naq by his father - on the occasion of their first hunt together as men.

====D&#x27;k tahg (AKA Daqtagh)====
A d&#x27;k tahg is a Klingon dagger. The knife has three blades: a main blade with a cutout in the center, and two smaller blades on either side. In some models, these side blades are spring–loaded and can pop out into position and close up for storage. In other models, the blades are fixed. It also features a pommel studded with blunt spikes. The d&#x27;k tahg first appears in &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;, and appears occasionally throughout the following films and television series. The knife was designed by Gil Hibben. Although the d&#x27;k tahg appears in &quot;Star Trek III&quot;, it is not referred to by name until &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

====Haf&#x27;leth====
This polearm is similar to a halberd.

====Iw&#x27;taj (AKA &#x27;Iw taj)====
Directly descended from the weapon which inspired the Klingon emblem, this dagger (literal translation: &#x27;blood-knife&#x27;) is longer and heavier than the d’k tahg (which was derived from it). The Iw&#x27;taj is a dedicated dueling weapon.

The two side–blades, one pointing up and one pointing down, serve particular functions. The upward-pointing blade is designed to catch an opponent&#x27;s weapon and, with a twisting motion, disarm him. The downward-pointing blade is designed to inflict shallow cuts in passing, sapping the enemy&#x27;s strength; said design allows the weapon to advance smoothly, without this blade getting in the way. Duelists often hook their index and middle fingers over the crossbar; doing this allows the weapon to achieve impressive agility, despite weakening the grip. It may also be used with a reverse grip.

The Iw&#x27;taj is often carried by traditionalists, and by discerning martial artists. Usually, a warrior who carries both a mek’leth and an Iw&#x27;taj is from a Qvav’mar background, and/or is a personal combatant of high caliber.

====Jej&#x27;taj (AKA jejtaj)====
This throwing-dagger is more often used defensively, to ward off blade attacks. Typically, it is wielded as a combination knuckleduster/boomerang.

====Mek&#x27;leth (AKA meqleH)====
A mek&#x27;leth is the Klingon short sword that appears in several episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; and in the film &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;. Designed by Dan Curry, it consists of a short, thick, curved blade with a metal guard extending back parallel with the grip to protect the hand. Worf is the most commonly seen user of the mek&#x27;leth, owning one and using it several times, including in hand-to-hand combat against Borg drones in &quot;First Contact&quot;.

====Oy&#x27;naq (AKA &#x27;oy&#x27;naQ)====
This &quot;pain-stick&quot; (the literal translation), capable of killing a 2-ton Rectyne Monopod, is used as part of the Klingon Age of Ascension ritual.

====Kut&#x27;luch (AKA qutluch)====
Similar to the d&#x27;k tahg, the kut&#x27;luch is &quot;the ceremonial weapon of an assassin&quot;. A kut&#x27;luch is designed to do considerable damage to internal organs, by Klingon standards thus making it an extremely lethal weapon. The kut&#x27;luch is featured in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Sins of the Father&quot;, when Worf&#x27;s brother, Kurn, is stabbed; and in the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Real Life&quot;, where the Doctor&#x27;s simulated &quot;son&quot; prepares for the Kut&#x27;luch ceremony.

====Tik&#x27;leth (AKA tIqleH)====
This “longsword” (the literal translation of tIq &#x27;etlh) is one of the more Terran–like Klingon weapons. Like spears, tik&#x27;leths are traditional weapons of the rank-and-file. Many nobles prefer a tik&#x27;leth&#x27;s offensive functionality to that of a bat&#x27;leth, while many soldiers carry mass-produced bat’leths as a status symbol.

===Romulan===

====Teral&#x27;n====
A Romulan polearm, similar to a trident with retractable blades. It appears in the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; reboot and is used by the renegade miner Nero. In the &quot;Countdown&quot; comic, Nero&#x27;s weapon is revealed to be the &quot;Debrune teral&#x27;n&quot;, an ancient Romulan artifact that symbolized the empire&#x27;s power; it is traditionally held by the presiding Praetor.

A similar weapon, resembling an axe was also used by a member of Nero&#x27;s crew.

===Vulcan===

====Ahn&#x27;woon====
An ahn&#x27;woon is a Vulcan catch–strangle weapon, similar in principle to a cast net but more versatile. Depending on the skill of the user, it can be used several ways. It is wide enough to be a sling. In the James Blish written adaptation of the &quot;TOS&quot; script, Kirk employs it this way and hits Spock in the ribs with a stone. The multi-strapped weapon (approximately 1.1 meters long) uses weights on the ends of the straps, like bolas, to entangle, stun, or cut the target. The application of tying action and wrapping, as with a garrote, can restrict the breathing of the target, asphyxiating the victim. It is considered the oldest Vulcan weapon.

====Lirpa====
A lirpa is a large Vulcan weapon consisting of a wooden staff with a semicircular blade at one end and a metal bludgeon on the other. It is similar to the monk&#x27;s spade and the pugil stick. Captain James T. Kirk and Spock used when they fought for possession of T&#x27;Pring during Spock&#x27;s Pon farr ritual in &quot;Amok Time&quot;. Soldiers sent after Jonathan Archer and T&#x27;Pol fought with because Vulcan&#x27;s &quot;Forge&quot; region makes conventional energy weapons useless.

===Others===

====Glavin====
In the &quot;TNG&quot; episode &quot;Code of Honor&quot;, the Ligonians have deep traditions of fighting with a poison-tipped hand weapon called a glavin. It is a large glove with a recurved claw at the end, and covered with dozens of spines. In several episodes, Worf is seen displaying one in his quarters, most likely the same one used by Lt. Tasha Yar.

====Mortaes====
In the &quot;TOS&quot; episode &quot;The Cloud Minders&quot;, mortaes and thongs are mining tools used as martial weapons by the &quot;troglyte&quot; (a corruption of &quot;troglodyte&quot;) miners, and apparently the ruling class is also trained with these weapons, as Plasus challenges Kirk to hand-to-hand combat, asking, &quot;Are you as brave with a mortae as with a phaser?&quot; Kirk responds, &quot;Both will kill.&quot;

====Ushaan-tor====
In the &quot;Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;United&quot;, Andorian commander Thy&#x27;lek Shran and the NX-01&#x27;s captain Jonathan Archer, as a second for a Tellarite officer who kills Tallas, Shran&#x27;s chief tactical officer and lover, engage in an Andorian &quot;ushaan&quot; duel. The weapon used is the ushaan-tor, an Andorian ice-mining blade. The handheld blade of the &quot;ushaan-tor&quot; is about 20 cm from end to end, and resembles an Inupiat Ulu blade from Alaska, but in a one-piece all-metal design instead of having a separate wooden handle.

==Subspace weapons==
Subspace weapons are a class of directed energy weapons that directly affect subspace. The weapons can produce actual tears in subspace, and are extremely unpredictable. These weapons were banned under the second Khitomer Accord. The Son&#x27;a equipped their vessels with these types of weapons.

===Isolytic burst===
Son&#x27;a vessels carried and used isolytic burst weapons, a type of subspace weapon. They were seen using this weapon against the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E in &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot;. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; was only able to escape the weapon&#x27;s effect by ejecting its warp core and detonating it to seal a subspace rift.

===Tricobalt devices===
The tricobalt warhead is a subspace weapon whose high-yield detonations can tear holes in subspace. Tricobalt devices are not a standard armament of Federation vessels and yields are calculated in Tera-Cochranes, indicating that its mechanism is somewhat similar to the general reaction in a warp field.

In &quot;TOS&quot;: &quot;A Taste of Armageddon&quot;, the Eminian Union classified the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; as &#x27;destroyed&#x27; when it was hit by virtual tricobalt satellites. In &quot;DS9&quot;: &quot;Trials and Tribble-ations&quot;, Arne Darvin plants a tricobalt explosive in a dead Tribble in an attempt to kill Kirk. USS &quot;Voyager&quot; uses a pair of tricobalt devices to destroy the Caretaker array in the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; pilot episode, &quot;Caretaker&quot;, and such a device was used against &quot;Voyager&quot; in the episode &quot;Blink of an Eye&quot;. A tricobalt warhead was also used by the Tholians in the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot;. They detonated a tricobalt warhead inside the gravity well of a dead star. The explosion created an interphasic rift, which they used to lure the Federation starship USS &quot;Defiant&quot; from another universe.

The games &quot;Star Trek: Armada&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Armada II&quot; have ships armed with Tricobalt devices for artillery support. The Federation &quot;Steamrunner&quot;-class, the Klingon &quot;Chuq&#x27;Beh&quot;-class Bird of Prey, the Romulan &quot;Raptor&quot;-class Warbird, and the Borg Harbinger are all capable of using them. The workings of the weapon is unknown but theorised is the use of Cobalt-60.

It is far more likely that tricobalt refers to the third periodical table analog for cobalt; similar to dilithium being the second periodic table equivalent of regular lithium. &quot;trititanium&quot; and most other in trek universe usage where a numeric prefix is appended to a regular real world periodic table element refers to additional periodic tables whose elements are composed of nucleons that are not protons or neutrons and maybe not even regular electrons yet can form atoms molecules and chemical compounds similar to normal matter.

Neutron radiation such as produced by a Cobalt 60 weapon is not very useful for destroying outposts, starships or anything else that is not a living creature.

==Other weapons==

===Magnetometric guided charges===
Around Stardate 43995, the Borg used this weapon to drive the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, NCC-1701-D, from the Paulson Nebula. This shortly leads to the abduction of Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

===Multikinetic neutronic mines===
During Season 4, Episode 1 of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, Captain Janeway consults with Borg representative Seven of Nine on how to destroy Species 8472. Janeway calls Seven of Nine&#x27;s &quot;multikinetic neutronic mine&quot; a &quot;weapon of mass destruction,&quot; following up on a statement from Tuvok that it would affect an entire starsystem, destroying innocent worlds. The mine&#x27;s five-million isoton yield can disperse Borg nanoprobes across a five-light year range.

===Dreadnought===
Dreadnought was a Cardassian self-guided missile, containing one thousand kilograms of matter, and another thousand of antimatter. Tuvok describes this as enough to destroy a small moon. Although described as a self-guided missile, in practice Dreadnought functions much like an autonomous starship, and it even had life support capability on board. It possesses shields, phasers, a complement of quantum torpedoes, a Thoron shock emitter, a plasma wave weapon, engines capable of reaching at least Warp 9, and a sophisticated computer AI. It appears in the &quot;Voyager&quot; episode of the same name. It had been captured by the Maquis due to a failed detonator and reprogrammed to attack its original creator. It was dragged into the Delta Quadrant in much the same manner as &quot;Voyager&quot;, and when unable to resolve the unforeseen situation it locked on to a planet that was similar to the one it was programmed to target, but which was inhabited by innocents. Dreadnought was equipped with an exceptionally sophisticated artificial intelligence, capable of &quot;paranoia&quot; to a certain degree, as when reprogrammer B&#x27;Elanna Torres attempted to prevent it from destroying the innocent planet, it came to the conclusion that she had been captured by her Cardassian enemies and forced to make up a story to prevent the attack; it then &quot;pretended&quot; to follow her commands and shut down, only to re-activate and continue its mission once she was no longer aboard.

===Series 5 long range tactical armor unit===
Similar in purpose to the Cardassian Dreadnought, the Tactical Armor Units are self-guided missiles with sophisticated artificial intelligence. They are much smaller than Dreadnought, being only a few feet in length, and while nowhere near as powerful, they are nonetheless classified as weapons of mass destruction, capable of destroying everything in a 200-kilometer radius with a highly focused antimatter explosion. Their coordination and control is done through a &quot;Strategic Command Matrix&quot;, analogous to a nuclear control network of the type used by the United States. Each one possesses shielding, warp drive of indeterminate speed, and a sentient, genius-level artificial intelligence programmed to do whatever is necessary to reach their targets and detonate. They can detect and prevent tampering, are intelligent enough to find a way past almost any obstacle, and can win engagements even when outnumbered. They were created by a Delta Quadrant race called the Druoda, and the devices were greatly feared for their endurance and tenacity.

===Q firearms===
Q firearms were used in the Q Civil War by the &quot;Voyager&quot; crew to compensate against the infinite power of the Q in &quot;The Q and the Grey&quot;. They are depicted as muzzle-loading muskets, to fit with the American Civil War-theme used by the Q Continuum as a concession to the human characters&#x27; limited perceptions. Presumably, their actual form would be as incomprehensible to non-Q as the Continuum itself. The use of the weapons caused stars to go supernova as a side effect in normal reality. They are arguably the most powerful weapons ever wielded by any humanoid species, as indicated by their ability to injure the otherwise-invulnerable Q.

===Red matter===
In the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; reboot, red matter was developed on Vulcan before 2387. When even a droplet is ignited an unstable singularity is formed; accordingly, it must be stored in a protective chamber. The red matter was originally to be used to save the Romulan homeworld from a volatile supernova, but the design was finished too late to prevent Romulus&#x27; destruction. Upon capture in the &quot;past&quot; (2258) by the Romulan Nero, it was used as a planet-destroying doomsday weapon in conjunction with a plasma drill which bored a hole almost to the core of a planet. A small amount of red matter was then activated at the bottom of the drilling site, creating a black hole in the heart of the planet that would tear it apart from within. Red matter was thus used to destroy an alternate Vulcan (&quot;alternate&quot; due to temporal disruption, from Nero&#x27;s haphazard method of time travel), then ultimately destroyed Nero&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Narada&quot;, along with all remaining technology from his ship, and all of the remaining red matter.

===Psionic resonator===
A psionic resonator was a weapon that functioned by amplifying telepathic energy and focusing it into kinetic form. In 2369 one type of Vulcan psionic resonator, known as the Stone of Gol was discovered to still exist, though in pieces, long after it was thought destroyed. The mercenary Arctus Baran was hired to locate the pieces and deliver them to the Vulcan Isolationist Movement.

<text>A chariot is a type of vehicle similar to a cart, driven by a charioteer, usually using horses to provide rapid motive power. The oldest known chariots have been found in burials of the Sintashta culture in modern-day Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia, dated to c. 1950–1880 BC and are depicted on cylinder seals from Central Anatolia in Kültepe dated to c. 1900 BC. The critical invention that allowed the construction of light, horse-drawn chariots was the spoked wheel.

The chariot was a fast, light, open, two-wheeled conveyance drawn by two or more equids (usually horses) that were hitched side by side, and was little more than a floor with a waist-high guard at the front and sides. It was initially used for ancient warfare during the Bronze and Iron Ages, but after its military capabilities had been superseded by light and heavy cavalries, chariots continued to be used for travel and transport, in processions, for games, and in races.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;chariot&quot; comes from the Latin term &quot;carrus&quot; through French &quot;chariot&quot;, a loanword from Gaulish &quot;karros&quot;.

In ancient Rome a &quot;biga&quot; described a chariot requiring two horses, a &quot;triga&quot; three, and a &quot;quadriga&quot; four.

== Origins ==

The wheel may have been invented at several places, with early evidence found in Ukraine, Poland, Germany, and Slovenia. Evidence of wheeled vehicles appears from the mid 4th millennium BC near-simultaneously in the Northern Caucasus (Maykop culture), and in Central Europe. These earliest vehicles may have been ox carts. A necessary precursor to the invention of the chariot is the domestication of animals, and specifically domestication of horses – a major step in the development of civilization. Despite the large impact horse domestication has had in transport and communication, tracing its origins has been challenging. Evidence supports horses having been domesticated in the Eurasian Steppes, with studies suggesting the Botai culture in modern-day Kazakhstan were the first, about 3500 BC. Others say horses were domesticated earlier than 3500 BC in Eastern Europe (modern Ukraine and Western Kazakhstan), 6000 years ago.

The spread of spoke-wheeled chariots has been closely associated with early Indo-Iranian migrations. The earliest known chariots have been found in Sintashta culture burial sites, and the culture is considered a strong candidate for the origin of the technology, which spread throughout the Old World and played an important role in ancient warfare. It is also strongly associated with the ancestors of modern domestic horses, the DOM2 population. (DOM2 horses originated from the Western Eurasia steppes, especially the lower Volga-Don, but not in Anatolia, during the late fourth and early third millennia BC. Their genes may show selection for easier domestication and stronger backs.)

These Aryan people migrated southward into South Asia, ushering in the Vedic period around 1750 BC. Shortly after this, about 1700 BC, evidence of chariots appears in Asia-Minor.

The earliest fully developed spoke-wheeled horse chariots are from the chariot burials of the Andronovo (Timber-Grave) sites of the Sintashta-Petrovka Proto-Indo-Iranian culture in modern Russia and Kazakhstan from around 2000 BC. This culture is at least partially derived from the earlier Yamna culture. It built heavily fortified settlements, engaged in bronze metallurgy on an industrial scale, and practiced complex burial rituals reminiscent of Hindu rituals known from the &quot;Rigveda&quot; and the &quot;Avesta&quot;. Over the next few centuries, the Andronovo culture spread across the steppes from the Urals to the Tien Shan, likely corresponding to the time of early Indo-Iranian cultures.

Not everyone agrees that the Sintashta culture vehicle finds are true chariots.

In 1996, Mary Aiken Littauer and Joost Crouwel wrote:
Peter Raulwing and Stefan Burmeister consider the Sintashta and Krivoe Ozero finds from the steppe to be carts rather than chariots:

==Spread by Indo-Europeans==
Chariots figure prominently in Indo-Iranian and early European mythology. Chariots are also an important part of both Hindu and Persian mythology, with most of the gods in their pantheon portrayed as riding them. The Sanskrit word for a chariot is &quot;rátha-&quot; (m.), which is cognate with Avestan &quot;raθa-&quot; (also m.), and in origin a substantiation of the adjective Proto-Indo-European &#x27; meaning &quot;having wheels&quot;, with the characteristic accent shift found in Indo-Iranian substantivisations. This adjective is in turn derived from the collective noun &#x27; &quot;wheels&quot;, continued in Latin &quot;rota&quot;, which belongs to the noun &#x27; for &quot;wheel&quot; (from &#x27; &quot;to run&quot;) that is also found in Germanic, Celtic and Baltic (Old High German &quot;rad&quot; n., Old Irish &quot;roth&quot; m., Lithuanian &quot;rãtas&quot; m.). Nomadic tribes of the Pontic steppes, like Scythians such as Hamaxobii, would travel in wagons, carts, and chariots during their migrations.

===Hittites===
The oldest testimony of chariot warfare in the ancient Near East is the Old Hittite Anitta text (18th century BC), which mentions 40 teams of horses (in the original cuneiform spelling: 40 &quot;ṢÍ-IM-TI&quot; ANŠE.KUR.RAḪI.A) at the siege of Salatiwara. Since the text mentions &quot;teams&quot; rather than &quot;chariots&quot;, the existence of chariots in the 18th century BC is uncertain. The first certain attestation of chariots in the Hittite empire dates to the late 17th century BC (Hattusili I). A Hittite horse-training text is attributed to Kikkuli the Mitanni (15th century BC).

The Hittites were renowned charioteers. They developed a new chariot design that had lighter wheels, with four spokes rather than eight, and that held three rather than two warriors. It could hold three warriors because the wheel was placed in the middle of the chariot and not at the back as in Egyptian chariots. Typically one Hittite warrior steered the chariot while the second man was usually the main archer; the third warrior would either wield a spear or sword when charging at enemies or hold up a large shield to protect himself and the others from enemy arrows.

Hittite prosperity largely depended on their control of trade routes and natural resources, specifically metals. As the Hittites gained dominion over Mesopotamia, tensions flared among the neighboring Assyrians, Hurrians, and Egyptians. Under Suppiluliuma I, the Hittites conquered Kadesh and, eventually, the whole of Syria. The Battle of Kadesh in 1274 BC is likely to have been the largest chariot battle ever fought, involving over 5,000 chariots.

===Bronze Age Indian Subcontinent ===

Models of single axled, solid wheeled ox-drawn vehicles, have been found at several mature Indus Valley cites, such as Chanhudaro, Daimabad, Harappa, and Nausharo.

Spoked-wheeled, horse-drawn chariots, often carrying an armed passenger, are depicted in second millennium BC Chalcolithic period rock paintings, examples are known from Chibbar Nulla, Chhatur Bhoj Nath Nulla, and Kathotia. There are some depictions of chariots among the petroglyphs in the sandstone of the Vindhya range. Two depictions of chariots are found in Morhana Pahar, Mirzapur district. One depicts a biga and the head of the driver. The second depicts a quadriga, with six-spoked wheels, and a driver standing up in a large chariot box. This chariot is being attacked. One figure, who is armed with a shield and a mace, stands in the chariot&#x27;s path; another figure, who is armed with a bow and arrow, threatens the right flank. It has been suggested (speculated) that the drawings record a story, most probably dating to the early centuries BC, from some center in the area of the Ganges–Yamuna plain into the territory of still Neolithic hunting tribes. The very realistic chariots carved into the Sanchi stupas are dated to roughly the 1st century.
Bronze Age solid-disk wheel carts were found in 2018 at Sinauli, which were interpreted by some as horse-pulled &quot;chariots,&quot; predating the arrival of the horse-centered Indo-Aryans. They were ascribed by Sanjay Manjul, director of the excavations, to the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture (OCP)/Copper Hoard Culture, which was contemporaneous with the Late Harappan culture, and interpreted by him as horse-pulled chariots. Majul further noted that &quot;the rituals relating to the Sanauli burials showed close affinity with Vedic rituals, and stated that &quot;the dating of the Mahabharata is around 1750 BC.&quot; According to Asko Parpola these finds were ox-pulled carts, indicating that these burials are related to an early Aryan migration of Proto-Indo-Iranian speaking people into the Indian subcontinent, &quot;forming then the ruling elite of a major Late Harappan settlement.&quot;

Horse-drawn chariots, as well as their cult and associated rituals, were spread by the Indo-Iranians, and horses and horse-drawn chariots were introduced in India by the Indo-Aryans.

====In religion====

In &quot;Rigveda&quot;, Indra is described as strong willed, armed with a thunderbolt, riding a chariot:Among Rigvedic deities, notably the Vedic Sun God Surya rides on a one spoked chariot driven by his charioteer Aruṇa. Ushas (the dawn) rides in a chariot, as well as Agni in his function as a messenger between gods and men.

The Jain Bhagavi Sutra states that Indian troops used a chariot with a club or mace attached to it during the war against the Licchavis during the reign of Ajatashatru of Magadha.

===Persia===


The Persians succeeded Elam in the mid 1st millennium. They may have been the first to yoke four horses to their chariots. They also used scythed chariots. Cyrus the Younger employed these chariots in large numbers at the Battle of Cunaxa.

Herodotus mentions that the Ancient Libyan and the Ancient Indian (Sattagydia, Gandhara and Hindush) satrapies supplied cavalry and chariots to Xerxes the Great&#x27;s army. However, by this time, cavalry was far more effective and agile than the chariot, and the defeat of Darius III at the Battle of Gaugamela (331 BC), where the army of Alexander simply opened their lines and let the chariots pass and attacked them from behind, marked the end of the era of chariot warfare (barring the Seleucid and Pontic powers, India, China, and the Celtic peoples).

== Introduction in the Near East ==
Chariots were introduced in the Near East in the 17(18)th–16th centuries BC. Some scholars argue that the horse chariot was most likely a product of the ancient Near East early in the 2nd millennium BC. Archaeologist Joost Crouwel writes that &quot;Chariots were not sudden inventions, but developed out of earlier vehicles that were mounted on disk or cross-bar wheels. This development can best be traced in the Near East, where spoke-wheeled and horse-drawn chariots are first attested in the earlier part of the second millennium BC...&quot; and were illustrated on a Syrian cylinder seal dated to either the 18th or 17th century BC.

===Early wheeled vehicles in the Near East===
According to Christoph Baumer, the earliest discoveries of wheels in Mesopotamia come from the first half of the third millennium BC – more than half a millennium later than the first finds from the Kuban region. At the same time, in Mesopotamia, some intriguing early pictograms of a sled that rests on wooden rollers or wheels have been found. They date from about the same time as the early wheel discoveries in Europe and may indicate knowledge of the wheel.

The earliest depiction of vehicles in the context of warfare is on the Standard of Ur in southern Mesopotamia, . These are more properly called wagons which were double-axled and pulled by oxen or a hybrid of a donkey and a female onager, named Kunga in the city of Nagar which was famous for breeding them. The hybrids were used by the Eblaite, early Sumerian, Akkadian and Ur III armies. Although sometimes carrying a spearman with the charioteer (driver), such heavy wagons, borne on solid wooden wheels and covered with skins, may have been part of the baggage train (e.g., during royal funeral processions) rather than vehicles of battle in themselves.

The Sumerians had a lighter, two-wheeled type of cart, pulled by four asses, and with solid wheels. The spoked wheel did not appear in Mesopotamia until the mid second millennium BC.

===Egypt===

Chariot use made its way into Egypt around 1650 BC during the Hyksos invasion of Egypt and establishment of the Fourteenth Dynasty. In 1659 BC the Indo-European Hittites sacked Babylon, which demonstrated the superiority of chariots in antiquity.

The chariot and horse were used extensively in Egypt by the Hyksos invaders from the 16th century BC onwards, though discoveries announced in 2013 potentially place the earliest chariot use as early as Egypt&#x27;s Old Kingdom (–2181 BC). In the remains of Egyptian and Assyrian art, there are numerous representations of chariots, which display rich ornamentation. The chariots of the Egyptians and Assyrians, with whom the bow was the principal arm of attack, were richly mounted with quivers full of arrows. The Egyptians invented the yoke saddle for their chariot horses in . As a general rule, the Egyptians used chariots as mobile archery platforms; chariots always had two men, with the driver steering the chariot with his reins while the main archer aimed his bow and arrow at any targets within range. The best preserved examples of Egyptian chariots are the four specimens from the tomb of Tutankhamun. Chariots can be pulled by two or more horses.

===Ancient Canaan and Israel===
Chariots are frequently mentioned in the Hebrew Tanakh and the Greek Old Testament, respectively, particularly by the prophets, as instruments of war or as symbols of power or glory. First mentioned in the story of Joseph (Genesis 50:9), &quot;Iron chariots&quot; are mentioned also in Joshua (17:16, 18) and Judges (1:19,4:3, 13) as weapons of the Canaanites and Israelites. 1 Samuel 13:5 mentions chariots of the Philistines, who are sometimes identified with the Sea Peoples or early Greeks.

Examples from The Jewish Study Bible of the Tanakh (&quot;Jewish Bible&quot;) include:

*Isaiah 2:7 &quot;Their land is full of silver and gold, there is no limit to their treasures; their land is full of horses, there is no limit to their chariots.&quot;
*Jeremiah 4:13 &quot;Lo, he&quot; &quot;ascends like clouds, his chariots are like a whirlwind, his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us, we are ruined!&quot;
*Ezekiel 26:10 &quot;From the cloud raised by his horses dust shall cover you; from the clatter of horsemen and wheels and chariots, your walls shall shake−when he enters your gates as men enter a breached city.&quot;
*Psalms 20:8 &quot;They [call] on chariots, they [call] on horses, but we call on the name of the L our God.&quot;
*Song of Songs 1:9 &quot;I have likened you, my darling, to a mare in Pharaoh&#x27;s chariots&quot;

Examples from the King James Version of the Christian Bible include:
* &quot;And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.&quot;
* &quot;And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.&quot;
*Acts 8:37–38 &quot;Then Philip said, &quot;If you believe with all your heart, you may.&quot; And he answered and said, &quot;I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.&quot; So he commanded the chariot to stand still. And both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he baptized him.&quot;

Small domestic horses may have been present in the northern Negev before 3000 BC. Jezreel (city) has been identified as the chariot base of King Ahab. And a decorated bronze tablet thought to be the head of a lynchpin of a Canaanite chariot was found at a site that may be Sisera&#x27;s fortress Harosheth Haggoyim.

=== Urartu ===
In Urartu (860–590 BC), the chariot was used by both the nobility and the military. In Erebuni (Yerevan), King Argishti of Urartu is depicted riding on a chariot which is pulled by two horses. The chariot has two wheels and each wheel has about eight spokes. This type of chariot was used around 800 BC.

==Introduction in Bronze-Age Europe==

As David W. Anthony writes in his book &quot;The Horse, the Wheel, and Language&quot;, in Eastern Europe, the earliest well-dated depiction of a wheeled vehicle (a wagon with two axles and four wheels) is on the Bronocice pot (). It is a clay pot excavated in a Funnelbeaker settlement in Swietokrzyskie Voivodeship in Poland. The oldest securely dated real wheel-axle combination in Eastern Europe is the Ljubljana Marshes Wheel ().

=== Greece ===
The later Greeks of the first millennium BC had a (still not very effective) cavalry arm (indeed, it has been argued that these early horseback riding soldiers may have given rise to the development of the later, heavily armed foot-soldiers known as hoplites), and the rocky terrain of the Greek mainland was unsuited for wheeled vehicles. The chariot was heavily used by the Mycaenean Greeks, most probably adopted from the Hittites, around 1600 BC. Linear B tablets from Mycenaean palaces record large inventories of chariots, sometimes with specific details as to how many chariots were assembled or not (i.e. stored in modular form).On a gravestone from the royal Shaft-grave V in Mycenae dated LH II (about 1500 BC) there is one of the earliest depiction of the chariot in Achaean art. This sculpture shows a single man driving a two-wheeled small box chariot. Later the vehicles were used in games and processions, notably for races at the Olympic and Panathenaic Games and other public festivals in ancient Greece, in &quot;hippodromes&quot; and in contests called &quot;agons&quot;. They were also used in ceremonial functions, as when a &quot;paranymph&quot;, or friend of a bridegroom, went with him in a chariot to fetch the bride home.

Herodotus (&quot;Histories&quot;, 5. 9) Reports that chariots were widely used in the Pontic–Caspian steppe by the Sigynnae.

Greek chariots were made to be drawn by two horses attached to a central pole. If two additional horses were added, they were attached on each side of the main pair by a single bar or &quot;trace&quot; fastened to the front or &quot;prow&quot; of the chariot, as may be seen on two prize vases in the British Museum from the Panathenaic Games at Athens, Greece, in which the driver is seated with feet resting on a board hanging down in front close to the legs of the horses. The biga itself consists of a seat resting on the axle, with a rail at each side to protect the driver from the wheels. Greek chariots appear to have lacked any other attachment for the horses, which would have made turning difficult.

The body or &quot;basket&quot; of the chariot rested directly on the axle (called &quot;beam&quot;) connecting the two wheels. There was no suspension, making this an uncomfortable form of transport. At the front and sides of the basket was a semicircular guard about 3 ft (1 m) high, to give some protection from enemy attack. At the back the basket was open, making it easy to mount and dismount. There was no seat, and generally only enough room for the driver and one passenger.

The reins were mostly the same as those in use in the 19th century, and were made of leather and ornamented with studs of ivory or metal. The reins were passed through rings attached to the collar bands or yoke, and were long enough to be tied round the waist of the charioteer to allow for defense.

The wheels and basket of the chariot were usually of wood, strengthened in places with bronze or iron. The wheels had from four to eight spokes and tires of bronze or iron. Due to the widely spaced spokes, the rim of the chariot wheel was held in tension over comparatively large spans. Whilst this provided a small measure of shock absorption, it also necessitated the removal of the wheels when the chariot was not in use, to prevent warping from continued weight bearing. Most other nations of this time had chariots of similar design to the Greeks, the chief differences being the mountings.

According to Greek mythology, the chariot was invented by Erichthonius of Athens to conceal his feet, which were those of a dragon.

The most notable appearance of the chariot in Greek mythology occurs when Phaëton, the son of Helios, in an attempt to drive the chariot of the sun, managed to set the earth on fire. This story led to the archaic meaning of a &quot;phaeton&quot; as one who drives a chariot or coach, especially at a reckless or dangerous speed. Plato, in his &quot;Chariot Allegory&quot;, depicted a chariot drawn by two horses, one well behaved and the other troublesome, representing opposite impulses of human nature; the task of the charioteer, representing reason, was to stop the horses from going different ways and to guide them towards enlightenment.

The Greek word for chariot, ἅρμα, &quot;hárma&quot;, is also used nowadays to denote a tank, properly called άρμα μάχης, &quot;árma mákhēs&quot;, literally a &quot;combat chariot&quot;.

=== Central and Northern Europe ===
The Trundholm sun chariot is dated to c. 1500-1300 BC (see: Nordic Bronze Age). The horse drawing the solar disk runs on four wheels, and the Sun itself on two. All wheels have four spokes. The &quot;chariot&quot; comprises the solar disk, the axle, and the wheels, and it is unclear whether the sun is depicted as the chariot or as the passenger. Nevertheless, the presence of a model of a horse-drawn vehicle on two spoked wheels in Northern Europe at such an early time is astonishing.

In addition to the Trundholm chariot, there are numerous petroglyphs from the Nordic Bronze Age that depict chariots. One petroglyph, drawn on a stone slab in a double burial from c. 1000 BC, depicts a biga with two four-spoked wheels.

The use of the composite bow in chariot warfare is not attested in northern Europe.

=== Western Europe ===

The Celts were famous for their chariots and modern English words like &quot;car&quot;, &quot;carriage&quot; and &quot;carry&quot; are ultimately derived from the native Brythonic language (Modern Welsh: &quot;Cerbyd&quot;). The word &quot;chariot&quot; itself is derived from the Norman French &quot;charriote&quot; and shares a Celtic root (Gaulish: &quot;karros&quot;). Some 20 iron-aged chariot burials have been excavated in Britain, roughly dating from between 500 BC and 100 BC. Virtually all of them were found in East Yorkshire – the exception was a find in 2001 in Newbridge, 10 km west of Edinburgh.

The Celtic chariot, which may have been called in Gaulish (compare Latin &quot;carpentum&quot;), was a &quot;biga&quot; that measured approximately in width and in length.

British chariots were open in front. Julius Caesar provides the only significant eyewitness report of British chariot warfare:
Chariots play an important role in Irish mythology surrounding the hero Cú Chulainn.

Chariots could also be used for ceremonial purposes. According to Tacitus (&quot;Annals&quot; 14.35), Boudica, queen of the Iceni and a number of other tribes in a formidable uprising against the occupying Roman forces, addressed her troops from a chariot in 61:

: &quot;Boudicca curru filias prae se vehens, ut quamque nationem accesserat, solitum quidem Britannis feminarum ductu bellare testabatur&quot;

: &quot;Boudicca, with her daughters before her in a chariot, went up to tribe after tribe, protesting that it was indeed usual for Britons to fight under the leadership of women.&quot;

The last mention of chariot use in battle seems to be at the Battle of Mons Graupius, somewhere in modern Scotland, in 84 CE. From Tacitus (&quot;Agricola&quot; 1.35–36) &quot;The plain between resounded with the noise and with the rapid movements of chariots and cavalry.&quot; The chariots did not win even their initial engagement with the Roman auxiliaries: &quot;Meantime the enemy&#x27;s cavalry had fled, and the charioteers had mingled in the engagement of the infantry.&quot;

Later through the centuries, the chariot was replaced by the &quot;war wagon&quot;. The &quot;war wagon&quot; was a medieval development used to attack rebel or enemy forces on battle fields. The wagon was given slits for archers to shoot enemy targets, supported by infantry using pikes and flails and later for the invention of gunfire by hand-gunners; side walls were used for protection against archers, crossbowmen, the early use of gunpowder and cannon fire.

It was especially useful during the Hussite Wars, c. 1420, by Hussite forces rebelling in Bohemia. Groups of them could form defensive works, but they also were used as hardpoints for Hussite formations or as firepower in pincer movements. This early use of gunpowder and innovative tactics helped a largely peasant infantry stave off attacks by the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s larger forces of mounted knights.

=== Etruria ===

The only intact Etruscan chariot dates to c. 530 BC and was uncovered as part of a chariot burial at Monteleone di Spoleto. Currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it is decorated with bronze plates decorated with detailed low-relief scenes, commonly interpreted as depicting episodes from the life of Achilles.

=== Rome ===
In the Roman Empire, chariots were not used for warfare, but for chariot racing, especially in circuses, or for triumphal processions, when they could be pulled by as many as ten horses or even by dogs, tigers, or ostriches. There were four divisions, or &quot;factiones&quot;, of charioteers, distinguished by the colour of their costumes: the red, blue, green and white teams. The main centre of chariot racing was the Circus Maximus, situated in the valley between the Palatine and Aventine Hills in Rome. The track could hold 12 chariots, and the two sides of the track were separated by a raised median termed the &quot;spina&quot;. Chariot races continued to enjoy great popularity in Byzantine times, in the Hippodrome of Constantinople, even after the Olympic Games had been disbanded, until their decline after the Nika riots in the 6th century. The starting gates were known as the Carceres.

An ancient Roman car or chariot pulled by four horses abreast together with the horses pulling it was called a &quot;Quadriga&quot;, from the Latin &quot;quadriugi&quot; (of a team of four). The term sometimes meant instead the four horses without the chariot or the chariot alone. A three-horse chariot, or the three-horse team pulling it, was a &quot;triga&quot;, from &quot;triugi&quot; (of a team of three). A two-horse chariot, or the two-horse team pulling it, was a &quot;biga&quot;, from &quot;biugi&quot;.

A popular legend that has been around since at least 1937 traces the origin of the 4 ft  in standard railroad gauge to Roman times, suggesting that it was based on the distance between the ruts of rutted roads marked by chariot wheels dating from the Roman Empire. There is no evidence of the distance being used in the millennium and a half between the departure of the Romans from Britain and the adoption of the gauge on the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825.

== Introduction in Ancient China ==
The earliest archaeological evidence of chariots in China, a chariot burial site discovered in 1933 at Hougang, Anyang in Henan province, dates to the rule of King Wu Ding of the Late Shang (). Oracle bone inscriptions suggest that the western enemies of the Shang used limited numbers of chariots in battle, but the Shang themselves used them only as mobile command-vehicles and in royal hunts.

During the Shang dynasty, members of the royal family were buried with a complete household and servants, including a chariot, horses, and a charioteer. A Shang chariot was often drawn by two horses, but four-horse variants are occasionally found in burials.

Jacques Gernet claims that the Zhou dynasty, which conquered the Shang ca. 1046 BC, made more use of the chariot than did the Shang and &quot;invented a new kind of harness with four horses abreast&quot;. The crew consisted of an archer, a driver, and sometimes a third warrior who was armed with a spear or dagger-axe. From the 8th to 5th centuries BC the Chinese use of chariots reached its peak. Although chariots appeared in greater numbers, infantry often defeated charioteers in battle.

Massed-chariot warfare became all but obsolete after the Warring-States period (476–221 BC). The main reasons were increased use of the crossbow, use of long halberds up to long and pikes up to long, and the adoption of standard cavalry units, and the adaptation of mounted archery from nomadic cavalry, which were more effective. Chariots would continue to serve as command posts for officers during the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) and the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD), while armored chariots were also used during the Han dynasty against the Xiongnu Confederation in the Han–Xiongnu War (133 BC to 89 AD), specifically at the Battle of Mobei (119 BC).

Before the Han dynasty, the power of Chinese states and dynasties was often measured by the number of chariots they were known to have. A country of a thousand chariots ranked as a medium country, and a country of ten thousand chariots ranked as a huge and powerful country.
