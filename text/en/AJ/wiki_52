<text>Hans Holbein the Younger ( , ; ;  – between 7 October and 29 November 1543) was a German-Swiss painter and printmaker who worked in a Northern Renaissance style, and is considered one of the greatest portraitists of the 16th century. He also produced religious art, satire, and Reformation propaganda, and he made a significant contribution to the history of book design. He is called &quot;the Younger&quot; to distinguish him from his father Hans Holbein the Elder, an accomplished painter of the Late Gothic school.

Holbein was born in Augsburg but worked mainly in Basel as a young artist. At first, he painted murals and religious works, and designed stained glass windows and illustrations for books from the printer Johann Froben. He also painted an occasional portrait, making his international mark with portraits of humanist Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam. When the Reformation reached Basel, Holbein worked for reformist clients while continuing to serve traditional religious patrons. His Late Gothic style was enriched by artistic trends in Italy, France, and the Netherlands, as well as by Renaissance humanism. The result was a combined aesthetic uniquely his own.

Holbein travelled to England in 1526 in search of work with a recommendation from Erasmus. He was welcomed into the humanist circle of Thomas More, where he quickly built a high reputation. He returned to Basel for four years, then resumed his career in England in 1532 under the patronage of Anne Boleyn and Thomas Cromwell. By 1535, he was King&#x27;s Painter to Henry VIII. In this role, he produced portraits and festive decorations, as well as designs for jewellery, plate, and other precious objects. His portraits of the royal family and nobles are a record of the court in the years when Henry was asserting his supremacy over the Church of England.

Holbein&#x27;s art was prized from early in his career. French poet and reformer Nicholas Bourbon (the elder) dubbed him &quot;the Apelles of our time&quot;, a typical accolade at the time. Holbein has also been described as a great &quot;one-off&quot; in art history since he founded no school. Some of his work was lost after his death, but much was collected and he was recognized among the great portrait masters by the 19th century. Recent exhibitions have also highlighted his versatility. He created designs ranging from intricate jewellery to monumental frescoes.

Holbein&#x27;s art has sometimes been called realist, since he drew and painted with a rare precision. His portraits were renowned in their time for their likeness, and it is through his eyes that many famous figures of his day are pictured today, such as Erasmus and More. He was never content with outward appearance, however; he embedded layers of symbolism, allusion, and paradox in his art, to the lasting fascination of scholars. In the view of art historian Ellis Waterhouse, his portraiture &quot;remains unsurpassed for sureness and economy of statement, penetration into character, and a combined richness and purity of style.&quot;

== Biography ==

=== Early career ===

Holbein was born in the free imperial city of Augsburg during the winter of 1497–98. He was a son of the painter and draughtsman Hans Holbein the Elder, whose trade he and his older brother, Ambrosius, followed. Holbein the Elder ran a large and busy workshop in Augsburg, sometimes assisted by his brother Sigmund, also a painter.

By 1515, Hans and Ambrosius had moved as journeymen painters to the city of Basel, a centre of learning and the printing trade. There they were apprenticed to Hans Herbster, Basel&#x27;s leading painter. The brothers found work in Basel as designers of woodcuts and metalcuts for printers. In 1515, the preacher and theologian Oswald Myconius invited them to add pen drawings to the margin of a copy of &quot;The Praise of Folly&quot; by the humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam. The sketches provide early evidence of Holbein&#x27;s wit and humanistic leaning. His other early works, including the double portrait of Basel&#x27;s mayor Jakob Meyer zum Hasen and his wife Dorothea, follow his father&#x27;s style. With Meyer zum Hasen, Holbein maintained a close working relationship until the latter was sacked in 1521. 

The young Holbein, alongside his brother and his father, is pictured in the left-hand panel of Holbein the Elder&#x27;s 1504 altar piece triptych the &quot;Basilica of St. Paul&quot;, which is displayed at the Staatsgalerie in Augsburg.
In 1517, father and son began a project in Lucerne (Luzern), painting internal and external murals for the merchant Jakob von Hertenstein. While in Lucerne, Holbein also designed cartoons for stained glass. The city&#x27;s records show that on 10 December 1517, he was fined five livres for fighting in the street with a goldsmith called Caspar, who was fined the same amount. That winter, Holbein probably visited northern Italy, though no record of the trip survives. Many scholars believe he studied the work of Italian masters of fresco, such as Andrea Mantegna, before returning to Lucerne. He filled two series of panels at Hertenstein&#x27;s house with copies of works by Andrea Mantegna, including &quot;The Triumphs of Caesar&quot;.

In 1519, Holbein moved back to Basel. His brother fades from the record at about this time, and it is usually presumed that he died. Holbein re-established himself rapidly in the city, running a busy workshop. He joined the painters&#x27; guild and took out Basel citizenship. He married Elsbeth Binsenstock-Schmid 1519, a widow a few years older than he was, who had an infant son, Franz, and was running her late husband&#x27;s tanning business. She bore Holbein a son of his own, Philipp, in their first year of marriage a girl called Katharina in 1526 and two more children, Jacob and Küngold in later years. 

Holbein was prolific during this period in Basel, which coincided with the arrival of Lutheranism in the city. He undertook a number of major projects, such as external murals for &quot;The House of the Dance&quot; and internal murals for the Council Chamber of the Town Hall. The former are known from preparatory drawings. The Council Chamber murals survive in a few poorly preserved fragments. Holbein also produced a series of religious paintings and designed cartoons for stained glass windows.

In a period of a revolution in book design, he illustrated for the publisher Johann Froben. His woodcut designs included those for the &quot;Dance of Death&quot;, cut by the formschneider Hans Lützelburger the &quot;Icones&quot; (illustrations of the Old Testament), and the title page of Martin Luther&#x27;s bible. Additionally he designed twelve alphabets, of those a Greek and Latin for Froben. The letters were ornamented with depictions of Greek and Roman gods, heads of Caesars, poets and philosophers. Through the woodcut medium, Holbein refined his grasp of expressive and spatial effects. 

Holbein also painted the occasional portrait in Basel, among them the double portrait of Jakob and Dorothea Meyer, and, in 1519, that of the young academic Bonifacius Amerbach. According to art historian Paul Ganz, the portrait of Amerbach marks an advance in his style, notably in the use of unbroken colours. For Meyer, he painted an altarpiece of the Madonna which included portraits of the donor, his wife, and his daughter. In 1523, Holbein painted his first portraits of the great Renaissance scholar Erasmus, who required likenesses to send to his friends and admirers throughout Europe. These paintings made Holbein an international artist. Holbein visited France in 1524, probably to seek work at the court of Francis I. When Holbein decided to seek employment in England in 1526, Erasmus recommended him to his friend the statesman and scholar Thomas More. &quot;The arts are freezing in this part of the world,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and he is on the way to England to pick up some angels&quot;.

=== England, 1526–1528 ===

Holbein broke his journey towards Antwerp, where he delivered a recommendation from Erasmus to Pieter Gillis. In Antwerp, he also bought some oak panels and may have met the painter Quentin Matsys. Gillis then seemed to have sent Holbein to the Court of England, where Sir Thomas More welcomed him to and found him a series of commissions. &quot;Your painter, my dearest Erasmus,&quot; he wrote, &quot;is a wonderful artist&quot;. Holbein painted the famous &quot;Portrait of Sir Thomas More&quot; and another of More with his family. The group portrait, original in conception, is known only from a preparatory sketch and copies by other hands. According to art historian Andreas Beyer, it &quot;offered a prelude of a genre that would only truly gain acceptance in Dutch painting of the seventeenth century&quot;. Seven fine-related studies of More family members also survive.

During this first stay in England, Holbein worked largely for a humanist circle with ties to Erasmus. Among his commissions was the portrait of William Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, who owned a Holbein portrait of Erasmus. Holbein also painted the Bavarian astronomer and mathematician Nicholas Kratzer, a tutor of the More family whose notes appear on Holbein&#x27;s sketch for their group portrait. Although Holbein did not work for the king during this visit, he painted the portraits of courtiers such as Sir Henry Guildford and his wife Lady Mary, and of Anne Lovell, identified in 2003 or 2004 as the subject of &quot;Lady with a Squirrel and a Starling&quot;. In May 1527, &quot;Master Hans&quot; also painted a panorama of the siege of Thérouanne for the visit of French ambassadors. With Kratzer, he devised a ceiling covered in planetary signs, under which the visitors dined. The chronicler Edward Hall described the spectacle as showing &quot;the whole Earth, environed with the sea, like a very map or cart&quot;.

=== Basel, 1528–1532 ===
In August 1528, Holbein bought a house in Basel in St.Johanns-Vorstadt and became the neighbor of Hieronymus Froben. For this house he paid a third in advance. He presumably returned home to preserve his citizenship, since he had been granted only a two-year leave of absence. Enriched by his success in England, Holbein bought a second neighboring house in 1531 for which he initially advanced only a seventh of the price and was to pay a yearly rate during the following six years. 

During this period in Basel, he painted &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Family&quot;, showing Elsbeth with the couple&#x27;s two eldest children, Philipp and Katherina, evoking images of the Virgin and Child with St John the Baptist. Art historian John Rowlands sees this work as &quot;one of the most moving portraits in art, from an artist, too, who always characterized his sitters with a guarded restraint&quot;.
Basel had become a turbulent city in Holbein&#x27;s absence. Reformers, swayed by the ideas of Zwingli, carried out acts of iconoclasm and banned imagery in churches. In April 1529, the free-thinking Erasmus felt obliged to leave his former haven for Freiburg im Breisgau. The iconoclasts probably destroyed some of Holbein&#x27;s religious artwork, though the paintings on the organ doors of the Basel Minster were saved. Evidence for Holbein&#x27;s religious views is fragmentary and inconclusive. &quot;The religious side of his paintings had always been ambiguous,&quot; suggests art historian John North, &quot;and so it remained&quot;. According to a register compiled to ensure that all major citizens subscribed to the new doctrines: &quot;Master Hans Holbein, the painter, says that we must be better informed about the [holy] table before approaching it&quot;. In 1530, the authorities called Holbein to account for failing to attend the reformed communion. Shortly afterwards, however, he was listed among those &quot;who have no serious objections and wish to go along with other Christians&quot;.

Holbein evidently retained favour under the new order. The reformist council paid him a retaining fee of 50 florins and commissioned him to resume work on the Council Chamber frescoes. They now chose themes from the Old Testament instead of the previous stories from classical history and allegory. Holbein&#x27;s frescoes of Rehoboam and of the meeting between Saul and Samuel were more simply designed than their predecessors. Holbein worked for traditional clients at the same time. His old patron Jakob Meyer paid him to add figures and details to the family altarpiece he had painted in 1526. Holbein&#x27;s last commission in this period was the decoration of two clock faces on the city gate in 1531. The reduced levels of patronage in Basel may have prompted his decision to return to England early in 1532.

=== England, 1532–1540 ===

Holbein returned to England, where the political and religious environment was changing radically. In 1532, Henry VIII was preparing to repudiate Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, in defiance of the pope. Among those who opposed Henry&#x27;s actions was Holbein&#x27;s former host and patron Sir Thomas More, who resigned as Lord Chancellor in May 1532. Around this time, Holbein is supposed to have decorated the mortuary roll of John Islip, abbot of Westminster, one of the last mortuary rolls created. Holbein seems to have distanced himself from More&#x27;s humanist milieu on this visit, and &quot;he deceived those to whom he was recommended&quot;, according to Erasmus. The artist found favour instead within the radical new power circles of the Boleyn family and Thomas Cromwell. Cromwell became the king&#x27;s secretary in 1534, controlling all aspects of government, including artistic propaganda. More was executed in 1535 along with John Fisher, whose portrait Holbein had also drawn.

Holbein&#x27;s commissions in the early stages of his second English period included portraits of Lutheran merchants of the Hanseatic League. The merchants lived and plied their trade at the Steelyard, a complex of warehouses, offices, and dwellings on the north bank of the Thames. Holbein rented a house in Maiden Lane nearby, and he portrayed his clients in a range of styles. His portrait of Georg Giese of Gdańsk shows the merchant surrounded by exquisitely painted symbols of his trade. His portrait of Derich Berck of Cologne, on the other hand, is classically simple and possibly influenced by Titian. For the guildhall of the Steelyard, Holbein painted the monumental allegories &quot;The Triumph of Wealth&quot; and &quot;The Triumph of Poverty&quot;, both now lost. The merchants also commissioned a street tableau of Mount Parnassus for Anne Boleyn&#x27;s coronation eve procession of 31 May 1533.
Holbein also portrayed various courtiers, landowners, and visitors during this time, and his most famous painting of the period was &quot;The Ambassadors&quot;. This life-sized panel portrays Jean de Dinteville, an ambassador of Francis I of France in 1533, and Georges de Selve, Bishop of Lavaur who visited London the same year. The work incorporates symbols and paradoxes, including an anamorphic (distorted) skull. According to scholars, these are enigmatic references to learning, religion, mortality, and illusion in the tradition of the Northern Renaissance. Art historians Oskar Bätschmann and Pascal Griener suggest that in &quot;The Ambassadors&quot;, &quot;Sciences and arts, objects of luxury and glory, are measured against the grandeur of Death&quot;.

No certain painted portraits survive of Anne Boleyn by Holbein, perhaps because her memory was purged following her execution for treason, incest, and adultery in 1536, although there is a drawing, as made from life by Holbein preparatory to painting a portrait. It is clear, however, that Holbein worked directly for Anne and her circle. He designed a cup engraved with her device of a falcon standing on roses, as well as jewellery and books connected to her. He also sketched several women attached to her entourage, including her sister-in-law Jane Parker. At the same time, Holbein worked for Thomas Cromwell as he masterminded Henry VIII&#x27;s reformation. Cromwell commissioned Holbein to produce reformist and royalist images, including anti-clerical woodcuts and the title page to Myles Coverdale&#x27;s English translation of the Bible. Henry VIII had embarked on a grandiose programme of artistic patronage. His efforts to glorify his new status as Supreme Head of the Church culminated in the building of Nonsuch Palace, which started in 1538.
By 1536, Holbein was employed as the King&#x27;s Painter on an annual salary of 30 pounds—though he was never the highest-paid artist on the royal payroll. Royal &quot;pictor maker&quot; Lucas Horenbout earned more, and other continental artists also worked for the king. In 1537, Holbein painted his most famous image: Henry VIII standing in a heroic pose with his feet planted apart. The left section has survived of Holbein&#x27;s cartoon for a life-sized wall painting at Whitehall Palace showing the king in this pose with his father behind him. The mural also depicted Jane Seymour and Elizabeth of York. It was destroyed by fire in 1698, but is known from engravings and from a 1667 copy by Remigius van Leemput. An earlier half-length portrait shows Henry in a similar pose, but all the full-length portraits of him are copies based on the Whitehall pattern. The figure of Jane Seymour in the mural is related to Holbein&#x27;s sketch and painting of her.

Jane died in October 1537, shortly after bearing Henry&#x27;s only legitimate son Edward VI. Holbein painted a portrait of the infant prince about two years later, clutching a sceptre-like gold rattle. Holbein&#x27;s final portrait of Henry dates from 1543 and was perhaps completed by others, depicting the king with a group of barber surgeons.

Holbein&#x27;s portrait style altered after he entered Henry&#x27;s service. He focused more intensely on the sitter&#x27;s face and clothing, largely omitting props and three-dimensional settings. He applied this clean, craftsman-like technique to miniature portraits such as that of Jane Small, and to grand portraits such as that of Christina of Denmark. He travelled with Philip Hoby to Brussels in 1538 and sketched Christina for the king, who was appraising the young widow as a prospective bride. John Hutton, the English ambassador in Brussels, reported that another artist&#x27;s drawing of Christina was &quot;sloberid&quot; (slobbered) compared to Holbein&#x27;s. In Wilson&#x27;s view, Holbein&#x27;s subsequent oil portrait is &quot;the loveliest painting of a woman that he ever executed, which is to say that it is one of the finest female portraits ever painted&quot;. 

The same year, Holbein and Hoby went to France to paint Louise of Guise and Anna of Lorraine for Henry VIII. Neither portrait of these cousins has survived. Holbein found time to visit Basel, where he was fêted by the authorities and granted a pension. On the way back to England, he apprenticed his son Philipp to Basel-born goldsmith Jacob David in Paris.
Holbein painted Anne of Cleves at Burgau Castle, posing her square-on and in elaborate finery. This was the woman whom Henry married at Düren at the encouragement of Thomas Cromwell in the summer of 1539. English envoy Nicholas Wotton reported that &quot;Hans Holbein hath taken the effigies of my Lady Anne and the lady Amelia [Anne&#x27;s sister] and hath expressed their images very lively&quot;. Henry was disillusioned with Anne in the flesh, however, and he divorced her after a brief, unconsummated marriage. There is a tradition that Holbein&#x27;s portrait flattered Anne, derived from the testimony of Sir Anthony Browne.

Henry said that he was dismayed by her appearance at Rochester, having seen her pictures and heard advertisements of her beauty—so much that his face fell. No one other than Henry ever described Anne as repugnant; French Ambassador Charles de Marillac thought her quite attractive, pleasant, and dignified, though dressed in unflattering, heavy German clothing, as were her attendants. Some of the blame for the king&#x27;s disillusionment fell on Thomas Cromwell, who had been instrumental in arranging the marriage and had passed on some exaggerated claims of Anne&#x27;s beauty. This was one of the factors that led to Cromwell&#x27;s downfall.

=== Last years and death, 1540–1543 ===

Holbein had deftly survived the downfall of his first two great patrons, Thomas More and Anne Boleyn, but Cromwell&#x27;s sudden arrest and execution on trumped-up charges of heresy and treason in 1540 undoubtedly damaged his career. Though Holbein retained his position as King&#x27;s Painter, Cromwell&#x27;s death left a gap no other patron could fill. It was, ironically, Holbein&#x27;s portrait of Anne of Cleves which largely led to Cromwell&#x27;s downfall: furious at being saddled with a wife he found entirely unattractive, the King directed all his anger at Cromwell. Granted, Cromwell had exaggerated her beauty, but there is no evidence that Henry blamed Holbein for supposedly flattering Anne&#x27;s looks.
Apart from routine official duties, Holbein now occupied himself with private commissions, turning again to portraits of Steelyard merchants. He also painted some of his finest miniatures, including those of Henry Brandon and Charles Brandon, sons of Henry VIII&#x27;s friend Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk and his fourth wife, Catherine Willoughby. Holbein managed to secure commissions among those courtiers who now jockeyed for power, in particular from Anthony Denny, one of the two chief gentlemen of the bedchamber. He became close enough to Denny to borrow money from him. He painted Denny&#x27;s portrait in 1541 and two years later designed a clock-salt for him. Denny was part of a circle that gained influence in 1542 after the failure of Henry&#x27;s marriage to Catherine Howard. The king&#x27;s marriage in July 1543 to the reformist Catherine Parr, whose brother Holbein had painted in 1541, established Denny&#x27;s party in power.

Holbein may have visited his wife and children in late 1540, when his leave of absence from Basel expired. None of his work dates from this period, and the Basel authorities paid him six months&#x27; salary in advance. The state of Holbein&#x27;s marriage has intrigued scholars, who base their speculations on fragmentary evidence. Apart from one brief visit, Holbein had lived apart from Elsbeth since 1532. His will reveals that he had two infant children in England, of whom nothing is known except that they were in the care of a nurse. 

Holbein&#x27;s unfaithfulness to Elsbeth may not have been new. Some scholars believe that Magdalena Offenburg, the model for the &quot;Darmstadt Madonna&quot; and for two portraits painted in Basel, was for a time Holbein&#x27;s mistress. Others dismiss the idea. One of the portraits was of Lais of Corinth, mistress of Apelles, the famous artist of Greek antiquity after whom Holbein was named in humanist circles. Whatever the case, it is likely that Holbein always supported his wife and children. When Elsbeth died in 1549, she was well off and still owned many of Holbein&#x27;s fine clothes; on the other hand, she had sold his portrait of her before his death.

Hans Holbein died between 7 October and 29 November 1543 at the age of 45. Karel van Mander stated in the early 17th century that he died of the plague. Wilson regards the story with caution since Holbein&#x27;s friends attended his bedside; and Peter Claussen suggests that he died of an infection. Describing himself as &quot;servant to the king&#x27;s majesty&quot;, Holbein made his will on 7 October at his home in Aldgate. The goldsmith John of Antwerp and a few German neighbours signed as witnesses. 

Holbein may have been in a hurry, because the will was not witnessed by a lawyer. On 29 November, John of Antwerp, the subject of several of Holbein&#x27;s portraits, legally undertook the administration of the artist&#x27;s last wishes. He presumably settled Holbein&#x27;s debts, arranged for the care of his two children, and sold and dispersed his effects, including many designs and preliminary drawings that have survived. The site of Holbein&#x27;s grave is unknown and may never have been marked. The churches of St Katherine Cree or St Andrew Undershaft in London are possible locations, being located near his house.

=== Influences ===
The first influence on Holbein was his father, Hans Holbein the Elder, an accomplished religious artist and portraitist who passed on his techniques as a religious artist and his gifts as a portraitist to his son. The young Holbein learned his craft in his father&#x27;s workshop in Augsburg, a city with a thriving book trade, where woodcut and engraving flourished. Augsburg also acted as one of the chief &quot;ports of entry&quot; into Germany for the ideas of the Italian Renaissance. By the time Holbein began his apprenticeship under Hans Herbster in Basel, he was already steeped in the late Gothic style, with its unsparing realism and emphasis on line, which influenced him throughout his life. In Basel, he was favoured by humanist patrons, whose ideas helped form his vision as a mature artist.

During his Swiss years, when he may have visited Italy, Holbein added an Italian element to his stylistic vocabulary. Scholars note the influence of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;sfumato&quot; (smoky) technique on his work, for example in his &quot;Lais of Corinth&quot;. From the Italians, Holbein learned the art of single-point perspective and the use of antique motifs and architectural forms. In this, he may have been influenced by Andrea Mantegna. The decorative detail recedes in his late portraits, though the calculated precision remains. Despite assimilating Italian techniques and Reformation theology, Holbein&#x27;s art in many ways extended the Gothic tradition.

His portrait style, for example, remained distinct from the more sensuous technique of Titian, and from the Mannerism of William Scrots, Holbein&#x27;s successor as King&#x27;s Painter. Holbein&#x27;s portraiture, particularly his drawings, had more in common with that of Jean Clouet, which he may have seen during his visit to France in 1524. He adopted Clouet&#x27;s method of drawing with coloured chalks on a plain ground, as well as his care over preliminary portraits for their own sake. During his second stay in England, Holbein learned the technique of limning, as practised by Lucas Horenbout. In his last years, he raised the art of the portrait miniature to its first peak of brilliance.

=== Religious works ===
Holbein followed in the footsteps of Augsburg artists like his father and Hans Burgkmair, who largely made their living from religious commissions. Despite calls for reform, the church in the late 15th century was medieval in tradition. It maintained an allegiance to Rome and a faith in pieties such as pilgrimages, veneration of relics, and prayer for dead souls. Holbein&#x27;s early work reflects this culture. The growing reform movement, led by humanists such as Erasmus and Thomas More, began, however, to change religious attitudes. Basel, where Martin Luther&#x27;s major works were first published, became the main centre for the transmission of Reformation ideas.

The gradual shift from traditional to reformed religion can be charted in Holbein&#x27;s work. His &quot;Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb&quot; of 1522 expresses a humanist view of Christ in tune with the reformist climate in Basel at the time. The &quot;Dance of Death&quot; (1523–26) refashions the late-medieval allegory of the &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; as a reformist satire. Holbein&#x27;s series of woodcuts shows the figure of &quot;Death&quot; in many disguises, confronting individuals from all walks of life. None escape Death&#x27;s skeleton clutches, even the pious.

In addition to the &quot;Dance of Death&quot; Holbein completed &quot;Icones&quot; or &quot;Series of the Old Gospel&quot; (It contains two works: &quot;The images of the stories of the Old Gospel&quot; and &quot;Portraits or printing boards of the story of the Old Gospel&quot;). These works were arranged by Holbein with Melchior &amp; Gaspar Trechsel in about 1526, later printed and edited in Latin by Jean &amp; Francois Frellon with 92 woodcuts. These two works also share the first four figures with the &quot;Dance of Death&quot;.

It appears that the Trechsel brothers initially intended to hire Holbein for illustrating Bibles. In fact, some of Holbein&#x27;s &quot;Icones&quot; woodcuts appear in the recently discovered &quot;Biblia cum Glossis&quot; by Michel De Villeneuve (Michael Servetus). Holbein woodcuts appear in several other works by Servetus: his Spanish translation of &quot;The images of the stories of the Old Gospel&quot;, printed by Juan Stelsio in Antwerp in 1540 (92 woodcuts), and also of his Spanish versification of the associated work &quot;Portraits or printing boards of the story of the Old Gospel&quot;, printed by Francois and Jean Frellon in 1542 (same 92 woodcuts plus 2 more), as it was demonstrated in the International Society for the History of Medicine, by the expert researcher in Servetus, González Echeverría, who also proved the existence of the other work of Holbein &amp; De Villeneuve, &quot;Biblia cum Glossis&quot; or &quot; Lost Bible&quot;.
Holbein painted many large religious works between 1520 and 1526, including the &quot;Oberried Altarpiece&quot;, the &quot;Solothurn Madonna&quot;, and the &quot;Passion&quot;. Only when Basel&#x27;s reformers turned to iconoclasm in the later 1520s did his freedom and income as a religious artist suffer.

Holbein continued to produce religious art, but on a much smaller scale. He designed satirical religious woodcuts in England. His small painting for private devotion, &quot;Noli Me Tangere&quot;, has been taken as an expression of his personal religion. Depicting the moment when the risen Christ tells Mary Magdalene not to touch him, Holbein adheres to the details of the bible story. The 17th-century diarist John Evelyn wrote that he &quot;never saw so much reverence and kind of heavenly astonishment expressed in a picture&quot;.

Holbein has been described as &quot;the supreme representative of German Reformation art&quot;. The Reformation was a varied movement, however, and his position was often ambiguous. Despite his ties with Erasmus and More, he signed up to the revolution begun by Martin Luther, which called for a return to the Bible and the overthrow of the papacy. In his woodcuts &quot;Christ as the Light of the World&quot; and &quot;The Selling of Indulgences&quot;, Holbein illustrated attacks by Luther against Rome. At the same time, he continued to work for Erasmians and known traditionalists. After his return from England to a reformed Basel in 1528, he resumed work both on Jakob Meyer&#x27;s Madonna and on the murals for the Council Chamber of the Town Hall. The Madonna was an icon of traditional piety, while the Old Testament murals illustrated a reformist agenda.

Holbein returned to England in 1532 as Thomas Cromwell was about to transform religious institutions there. He was soon at work for Cromwell&#x27;s propaganda machine, creating images in support of the royal supremacy and (in the case of &quot;An Allegory of the Old and New Testaments&quot;) Lutheranism. During the period of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, he produced a series of small woodcuts in which biblical villains were dressed as monks. His reformist painting &quot;The Old and the New Law&quot; identified the Old Testament with the &quot;Old Religion&quot;. Scholars have detected subtler religious references in his portraits. In &quot;The Ambassadors&quot;, for example, details such as the Lutheran hymn book and the crucifix behind the curtain allude to the context of the French mission. Holbein painted few religious images in the later part of his career. He focused on secular designs for decorative objects, and on portraits stripped of inessentials.

=== Portraits ===

For Holbein, &quot;everything began with a drawing&quot;. A gifted draughtsman, he was heir to a German tradition of line drawing and precise preparatory design. Holbein&#x27;s chalk and ink portraits demonstrate his mastery of outline. He always made preparatory portraits of his sitters, though many drawings survive for which no painted version is known, suggesting that some were drawn for their own sake. Holbein produced relatively few portraits during his years in Basel. Among these were his 1516 studies of Jakob and Dorothea Meyer, sketched, like many of his father&#x27;s portrait drawings, in silverpoint and chalk.

Holbein painted most of his portraits during his two periods in England. In the first, between 1526 and 1528, he used the technique of Jean Clouet for his preliminary studies, combining black and coloured chalks on unprimed paper. In the second, from 1532 to his death, he drew on smaller sheets of pink-primed paper, adding pen and brushwork in ink to the chalk. Judging by the three-hour sitting given to him by Christina of Denmark, Holbein could produce such portrait studies quickly. Some scholars believe that he used a mechanical device to help him trace the contours of his subjects&#x27; faces. Holbein paid less attention to facial tones in his later drawings, making fewer and more emphatic strokes, but they are never formulaic. His grasp of spatial relationships ensures that each portrait, however sparely drawn, conveys the sitter&#x27;s presence.

Holbein&#x27;s painted portraits were closely founded on drawing. Holbein transferred each drawn portrait study to the panel with the aid of geometrical instruments. He then built up the painted surface in tempera and oil, recording the tiniest detail, down to each stitch or fastening of costume. In the view of art historian Paul Ganz, &quot;The deep glaze and the enamel-like lustre of the colouring were achieved by means of the metallic, highly polished crayon groundwork, which admitted of few corrections and, like the preliminary sketch, remained visible through the thin layer of colour&quot;.

The result is a brilliant portrait style in which the sitters appear, in Foister&#x27;s words, as &quot;recognisably individual and even contemporary-seeming&quot; people, dressed in minutely rendered clothing that provides an unsurpassed source for the history of Tudor costume. Holbein&#x27;s humanist clients valued individuality highly. According to Strong, his portrait subjects underwent &quot;a new experience, one which was a profound visual expression of humanist ideals&quot;.

Commentators differ in their response to Holbein&#x27;s precision and objectivity as a portraitist. What some see as an expression of spiritual depth in his sitters, others have called mournful, aloof, or even vacant. &quot;Perhaps an underlying coolness suffuses their countenances,&quot; wrote Holbein&#x27;s 19th-century biographer Alfred Woltmann, &quot;but behind this outward placidness lies hidden a breadth and depth of inner life&quot;. Some critics see the iconic and pared-down style of Holbein&#x27;s later portraits as a regression. Kenyon Cox, for example, believes that his methods grew more primitive, reducing painting &quot;almost to the condition of medieval illumination&quot;. Erna Auerbach relates the &quot;decorative formal flatness&quot; of Holbein&#x27;s late art to the style of illuminated documents, citing the group portrait of Henry VIII and the Barber Surgeons&#x27; Company. Other analysts detect no loss of powers in Holbein&#x27;s last phase.

Until the later 1530s, Holbein often placed his sitters in a three-dimensional setting. At times, he included classical and biblical references and inscriptions, as well as drapery, architecture, and symbolic props. Such portraits allowed Holbein to demonstrate his virtuosity and powers of allusion and metaphor, as well as to hint at the private world of his subjects. His 1532 portrait of Sir Brian Tuke, for example, alludes to the sitter&#x27;s poor health, comparing his sufferings to those of Job. The depiction of the Five wounds of Christ and the inscription &quot;INRI&quot; on Tuke&#x27;s crucifix are, according to scholars Bätschmann and Griener, &quot;intended to protect its owner against ill-health&quot;. Holbein portrays the merchant Georg Gisze among elaborate symbols of science and wealth that evoke the sitter&#x27;s personal iconography. However, some of Holbein&#x27;s other portraits of Steelyard merchants, for example that of Derich Born, concentrate on the naturalness of the face. They prefigure the simpler style that Holbein favoured in the later part of his career.

Study of Holbein&#x27;s later portraits has been complicated by the number of copies and derivative works attributed to him. Scholars now seek to distinguish the true Holbeins by the refinement and quality of the work. The hallmark of Holbein&#x27;s art is a searching and perfectionist approach discernible in his alterations to his portraits. In the words of art historian John Rowlands:

This striving for perfection is very evident in his portrait drawings, where he searches with his brush for just the right line for the sitter&#x27;s profile. The critical faculty in making this choice and his perception of its potency in communicating decisively the sitter&#x27;s character is a true measure of Holbein&#x27;s supreme greatness as a portrait painter. Nobody has ever surpassed the revealing profile and stance in his portraits: through their telling use, Holbein still conveys across the centuries the character and likeness of his sitters with unrivalled mastery.

=== Miniatures ===

During his last decade, Holbein painted a number of miniatures, which are small portraits worn as a kind of jewel. His miniature technique derived from the medieval art of manuscript illumination. His small panel portrait of Henry VIII shows an interpenetration between his panel and miniature painting. Holbein&#x27;s large pictures had always contained a miniature-like precision. He now adapted this skill to the smaller form, somehow retaining a monumental effect. The twelve or so certain miniatures by Holbein that survive reveal his mastery of &quot;limning&quot;, as the technique was called. 

His miniature portrait of Jane Small, with its rich blue background, crisp outlines, and absence of shading, is considered a masterpiece of the genre. According to art historian Graham Reynolds, Holbein &quot;portrays a young woman whose plainness is scarcely relieved by her simple costume of black-and-white materials, and yet there can be no doubt that this is one of the great portraits of the world. With remarkable objectivity Holbein has not added anything of himself or subtracted from his sitter&#x27;s image; he has seen her as she appeared in a solemn mood in the cold light of his painting-room&quot;.

=== Designs ===
Throughout his life, Holbein designed both large-scale decorative works such as murals and smaller objects, including plate and jewellery. In many cases, his designs, or copies of them, are the sole evidence for such works. For example, his murals for the Hertenstein House in Lucerne and for the House of the Dance in Basel are known only through his designs. As his career progressed, he added Italian Renaissance motifs to his Gothic vocabulary.

Many of the intricate designs etched into suits of Greenwich armour, including King Henry&#x27;s own personal tournament harnesses, were based on designs by Holbein. His style continued to influence the unique form of English armour for nearly half a century after his death.

Holbein&#x27;s cartoon for part of the dynastic Tudor wall painting at Whitehall reveals how he prepared for a large mural. It was made of 25 pieces of paper, each figure cut out and pasted onto the background. Many of Holbein&#x27;s designs for glass painting, metalwork, jewellery, and weapons also survive. All demonstrate the precision and fluidity of his draughtsmanship. In the view of art historian Susan Foister, &quot;These qualities so animate his decorative designs, whether individual motifs, such as his favoured serpentine mermen and women, or the larger shapes of cups, frames, and fountains, that they scintillate on paper even before their transformation into precious metal and stone&quot;.

Holbein&#x27;s way of designing objects was to sketch preliminary ideas and then draw successive versions with increasing precision. His final draft was a presentation version. He often used traditional patterns for ornamental details such as foliage and branches. When designing precious objects, Holbein worked closely with craftsmen such as goldsmiths including Cornelis Hayes. His design work, suggests art historian John North, &quot;gave him an unparalleled feel for the textures of materials of all kinds, and it also gave him the habit of relating physical accessories to face and personality in his portraiture&quot;. Although little is known of Holbein&#x27;s workshop, scholars assume that his drawings were partly intended as sources for his assistants.
== Legacy and reputation ==

Holbein&#x27;s fame owes something to that of his sitters. Several of his portraits have become cultural icons. He created the standard image of Henry VIII. In painting Henry as an iconic hero, however, he also subtly conveyed the tyranny of his character. Holbein&#x27;s portraits of other historical figures, such as Erasmus, Thomas More, and Thomas Cromwell, have fixed their images for posterity. The same is true for the array of English lords and ladies whose appearance is often known only through his art. For this reason, John North calls Holbein &quot;the cameraman of Tudor history&quot;. In Germany, on the other hand, Holbein is regarded as an artist of the Reformation, and in Europe of humanism.

In Basel, Holbein&#x27;s legacy was secured by his friend Amerbach and by Amerbach&#x27;s son Basilius, who collected his work. The Amerbach-Kabinett later formed the core of the Holbein collection at the Kunstmuseum Basel. Although Holbein&#x27;s art was also valued in England, few 16th-century English documents mention him. Archbishop Matthew Parker (1504–75) observed that his portraits were &quot;delineated and expressed to the resemblance of life&quot;. At the end of the 16th century, the miniature portraitist Nicholas Hilliard spoke in his treatise &quot;Arte of Limning&quot; of his debt to Holbein: &quot;Holbein&#x27;s manner have I ever imitated, and hold it for the best&quot;. No account of Holbein&#x27;s life was written until Karel van Mander&#x27;s often inaccurate &quot;Schilder-Boeck&quot; (Painter-Book) of 1604.
Holbein&#x27;s followers produced copies and versions of his work, but he does not seem to have founded a school. Biographer Derek Wilson calls him one of the great &quot;one-offs&quot; of art history. The only artist who appears to have adopted his techniques was John Bettes the Elder, whose &quot;Man in a Black Cap&quot; (1545) is close in style to Holbein. Scholars differ about Holbein&#x27;s influence on English art. In Foister&#x27;s view: &quot;Holbein had no real successors and few imitators in England. The disparity between his subtle, interrogatory portraits of men and women whose gazes follow us, and the stylised portraits of Elizabeth I and her courtiers can seem extreme, the more so as it is difficult to trace a proper stylistic succession to Holbein&#x27;s work to bridge the middle of the century&quot;. 

Nevertheless, &quot;modern&quot; painting in England may be said to have begun with Holbein. That later artists were aware of his work is evident in their own, sometimes explicitly. Hans Eworth, for example, painted two full-length copies in the 1560s of Holbein&#x27;s Henry VIII derived from the Whitehall pattern and included a Holbein in the background of his &quot;Mary Neville, Lady Dacre&quot;. The influence of Holbein&#x27;s &quot;monumentality and attention to texture&quot; has been detected in Eworths&#x27; work. According to art historian Erna Auerbach: &quot;Holbein&#x27;s influence on the style of English portraiture was undoubtedly immense. Thanks to his genius, a portrait type was created which both served the requirements of the sitter and raised portraiture in England to a European level. It became the prototype of the English Court portrait of the Renaissance period&quot;.
A fashion for Old Masters in England after the 1620s created demand for Holbein, led by the connoisseur Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel. Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford, offered to buy Holbein portraits from a friend and supply faithful copies as substitutes. The Flemish artists Anthony van Dyck and Peter Paul Rubens discovered Holbein through Arundel. Arundel commissioned engravings of his Holbeins from the Czech Wenceslaus Hollar, some of works now lost. From this time, Holbein&#x27;s art was also prized in the Netherlands, where the picture dealer Michel Le Blon became a Holbein connoisseur. The first &quot;catalogue raisonné&quot; of Holbein&#x27;s work was produced by the Frenchman Charles Patin and the Swiss Sebastian Faesch in 1656. They published it with Erasmus&#x27;s &quot;Encomium moriæ&quot; (&quot;The Praise of Folly&quot;) and an inaccurate biography that portrayed Holbein as dissolute.

In the 18th century, Holbein found favour in Europe with those who saw his precise art as an antidote to the Baroque. In England, the connoisseur and antiquarian Horace Walpole (1717–97) praised him as a master of the Gothic. Walpole hung his neo-Gothic house at Strawberry Hill with copies of Holbeins and kept a Holbein room. From around 1780, a re-evaluation of Holbein set in, and he was enshrined among the canonical masters. A new cult of the sacral art masterpiece arose, endorsed by the German Romantics. This view suffered a setback during the famous controversy known as the &quot;Holbein-Streit&quot; (Holbein dispute) in the 1870s. It emerged that the revered Meyer &quot;Madonna&quot; at Dresden was a copy, and that the little-known version at Darmstadt was the Holbein original. Since then, scholars have gradually removed the attribution to Holbein from many copies and derivative works. The current scholarly view of Holbein&#x27;s art stresses his versatility, not only as a painter but as a draughtsman, printmaker, and designer. Art historian Erika Michael believes that &quot;the breadth of his artistic legacy has been a significant factor in the sustained reception of his oeuvre&quot;.

<text>Albrecht Giese (10 February 1524 – 1 August 1580) was a councilman and diplomat of the city of Danzig (Gdańsk). He was a member of the Hanseatic League, and part of an important merchant family who had offices in London and Danzig.

==Biography==
Giese was born in Danzig, in the Kingdom of Poland, to the influential and wealthy merchant Patrician family Giese (or Gisze). The Giese family had emigrated from Unna, near Giesen, Cologne in 1430. They were part of the Hanseatic League, that had come to dominate European trade in the 14th and 15th-centuries. The Giese family maintained offices in London, at the &quot;Steelyard&quot;, where Hanseatic and foreign merchants congregated and his sons appear to have managed the London branch.

Albrecht studied at the Universities of Greifswald, Wittenberg and Heidelberg. As was the custom of the time for Hanseatic merchants, he toured Europe for several years to learn different languages after his formal studies, as was necessary for a long-distance trader. In 1564, on his return to Danzig, he married Elisabeth Langenbeck, whose uncle, Johann Ferber, had been the Mayor of Danzig. The following year, Giese became a councilman. Over the next six years, he was Danzig&#x27;s delegate at several Hanse meetings in Lübeck.

Open conflict between the Polish king and the city council broke out when the city council was arrested for opposing the loss of certain privileges according to the terms of the declared Union of Lublin, which the city had not agreed to. Negotiations between the city and the king took place in 1568/69, initially at Piotrków Trybunalski. Giese was a member of a delegation, led by the mayor of the city, Johann Brandes in negotiations. Despite being subjected to severe pressure and incarceration for a year at Kraków, the delegation refused to submit to the king&#x27;s terms, thereby upholding independence, Giese and Councilor Georg Kleefeld were eventually released in 1570 against a ransom of 100,000 guilders.

Giese ultimately became Mayor of Danzig. In 1579, Giese was named royal burgrave of Danzig by the Polish king, a position that entailed the supervision of the judiciary system of the city.

Albrect and Elisabeth Giese had at least seven children. Two of his sons enjoyed prominent careers. One of his older sons, Tiedemann Giese, became the Bishop of Chełm (Culm) and later, Prince-Bishop of Warmia (Ermland), while one of the younger sons, Georg Giese became a merchant and who is noted for having his portrait painted by Hans Holbein the younger.

Albrecht Giese died in 1580 in Danzig.

<doc id="48329" wikidata="Q12119" url="?curid=48329" title="Celestial pole">
<text>The north and south celestial poles are the two points in the sky where Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation, indefinitely extended, intersects the celestial sphere. The north and south celestial poles appear permanently directly overhead to observers at Earth&#x27;s North Pole and South Pole, respectively. As Earth spins on its axis, the two celestial poles remain fixed in the sky, and all other celestial points appear to rotate around them, completing one circuit per day (strictly, per sidereal day).

The celestial poles are also the poles of the celestial equatorial coordinate system, meaning they have declinations of +90 degrees and −90 degrees (for the north and south celestial poles, respectively). Despite their apparently fixed positions, the celestial poles in the long term do not actually remain permanently fixed against the background of the stars. Because of a phenomenon known as the precession of the equinoxes, the poles trace out circles on the celestial sphere, with a period of about 25,700 years. The Earth&#x27;s axis is also subject to other complex motions which cause the celestial poles to shift slightly over cycles of varying lengths (see nutation, polar motion and axial tilt). Finally, over very long periods the positions of the stars themselves change, because of the stars&#x27; proper motions. To take into account such movement, celestial pole definitions come with an epoch to specify the date of the rotation axis; J2000.0 is the current standard.

An analogous concept applies to other planets: a planet&#x27;s celestial poles are the points in the sky where the projection of the planet&#x27;s axis of rotation intersects the celestial sphere. These points vary because different planets&#x27; axes are oriented differently (the apparent positions of the stars also change slightly because of parallax effects).

==Finding the north celestial pole==


The north celestial pole currently is within one degree of the bright star Polaris (named from the Latin &quot;stella polaris&quot;, meaning &quot;pole star&quot;). This makes Polaris, colloquially known as the &quot;North Star&quot;, useful for navigation in the Northern Hemisphere: not only is it always above the north point of the horizon, but its altitude angle is always (nearly) equal to the observer&#x27;s geographic latitude (though it can, of course, only be seen from locations in the Northern Hemisphere).

Polaris is near the north celestial pole for only a small fraction of the 25,700-year precession cycle. It will remain a good approximation for about 1,000 years, by which time the pole will have moved closer to Alrai (Gamma Cephei). In about 5,500 years, the pole will have moved near the position of the star Alderamin (Alpha Cephei), and in 12,000 years, Vega (Alpha Lyrae) will become the &quot;North Star&quot;, though it will be about six degrees from the true north celestial pole.

To find Polaris, from a point in the Northern Hemisphere, face north and locate the Big Dipper (Plough) and Little Dipper asterisms. Looking at the &quot;cup&quot; part of the Big Dipper, imagine that the two stars at the outside edge of the cup form a line pointing upward out of the cup. This line points directly at the star at the tip of the Little Dipper&#x27;s handle. That star is Polaris, the North Star.

==Finding the south celestial pole==


The south celestial pole is visible only from the Southern Hemisphere. It lies in the dim constellation Octans, the Octant. Sigma Octantis is identified as the south pole star, more than one degree away from the pole, but with a magnitude of 5.5 it is barely visible on a clear night.

===Method one: The Southern Cross===

The south celestial pole can be located from the Southern Cross (Crux) and its two &quot;pointer&quot; stars α Centauri and β Centauri. Draw an imaginary line from γ Crucis to α Crucis—the two stars at the extreme ends of the long axis of the cross—and follow this line through the sky. Either go four-and-a-half times the distance of the long axis in the direction the narrow end of the cross points, or join the two pointer stars with a line, divide this line in half, then at right angles draw another imaginary line through the sky until it meets the line from the Southern Cross. This point is 5 or 6 degrees from the south celestial pole. Very few bright stars of importance lie between Crux and the pole itself, although the constellation Musca is fairly easily recognised immediately beneath Crux.

===Method two: Canopus and Achernar===

The second method uses Canopus (the second-brightest star in the sky) and Achernar. Make a large equilateral triangle using these stars for two of the corners. But where should the third corner go? It could be on either side of the line connecting Achernar and Canopus, and the wrong side will not lead to the pole. To find the correct side, imagine that Archernar and Canopus are both points on the circumference of a circle. The third corner of the equilateral triangle will also be on this circle. The corner should be placed clockwise from Achernar and anticlockwise from Canopus. The third imaginary corner will be the south celestial pole. If the opposite is done, the point will land in the middle of Eridanus, which isn&#x27;t at the pole. If Canopus has not yet risen, the second-magnitude Alpha Pavonis can also be used to form the triangle with Achernar and the pole. In this case, go anticlockwise from Achernar instead of clockwise, form the triangle with Canopus, and the third point, the pole, will reveal itself. The wrong way will lead to Aquarius, which is very far away from the celestial pole.

===Method three: The Magellanic Clouds===

The third method is best for moonless and clear nights, as it uses two faint &quot;clouds&quot; in the Southern Sky. These are marked in astronomy books as the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (the LMC and the SMC). These &quot;clouds&quot; are actually dwarf galaxies near the Milky Way. Make an equilateral triangle, the third point of which is the south celestial pole. Like before, the SMC, LMC, and the pole will all be points on an equilateral triangle on an imaginary circle. The pole should be placed clockwise from the SMC and anticlockwise from the LMC. Going in the wrong direction will land you in the constellation of Horologium instead.

===Method four: Sirius and Canopus===

A line from Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, through Canopus, the second-brightest, continued for the same distance lands within a couple of degrees of the pole. In other words, Canopus is halfway between Sirius and the pole.

<doc id="48331" wikidata="Q3916780" url="?curid=48331" title="Measure word">
<text>In linguistics, measure words are words (or morphemes) that are used in combination with a numeral to indicate an amount of something represented by some noun. Many languages use measure words, and East Asian languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean use them very extensively in the form of number classifiers.

==Description==
Measure words denote a unit of measurement and are used with mass nouns (uncountable nouns), and in some cases also with count nouns. For instance, in English, &quot;&quot; is a mass noun and thus one cannot say &quot;three muds&quot;, but one can say &quot;three drops of mud&quot;, &quot;three pails of mud&quot;, etc. In these examples, &quot;drops&quot; and &quot;pails&quot; function as measure words. One can also say &quot;three pails of shells&quot;; in this case the measure word &quot;pails&quot; accompanies a count noun (&quot;shells&quot;).

The term &quot;measure word&quot; is also sometimes used to refer to numeral classifiers, which are used with count nouns in some languages. For instance, in English no extra word is needed when saying &quot;three people&quot;, but in many East Asian languages a numeral classifier is added, just as a measure word is added for uncountable nouns in English. For example:



There are numerous Chinese measure words, and nouns differ in what measure words they can use. While many linguists maintain a distinction between measure words and numeral classifiers, the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. For instance, materials for teaching Chinese as a second language generally refer to Chinese classifiers as &quot;measure words&quot;. The corresponding Chinese term is (), which can be directly translated as &quot;quantity word&quot;.

Most measure words in English correspond to units of measurement or containers, and are themselves count nouns rather than grammatical particles:
*one &quot;quart&quot; of water
*three &quot;cups&quot; of coffee
*four &quot;kernels&quot; of corn, three &quot;ears&quot; of corn, two &quot;bushels&quot; of corn

Though similar in construction, fractions are not measure words. For example, in &quot;seven-eighths of an apple&quot; the fraction acts as a noun. Compare that to &quot;seven slices of apple&quot; where &quot;apple&quot; is a mass noun and does not require the article &quot;an&quot;. Combining the two, e.g. &quot;seven-eighths of a slice of apple&quot;, makes it clear the fraction must be a noun referring to a part of another countable noun.

In many languages, including the East Asian languages referred to above, the analogous constructions do not include any equivalent of the English &quot;of&quot;. In German, for example, &quot;ein Glas Bier&quot; means &quot;a glass [of] beer&quot;. This is interesting since both languages are West Germanic languages, making them closely related to each other. However, the equivalent of the English &quot;of&quot; is common in Romance languages such as &quot;a glass of beer&quot;:
: 

==Classifiers versus measure words==
Classifiers play a similar role to measure words, except that measure words denote a particular quantity of something (a drop, a cupful, a pint, etc.), rather than the inherent countable units associated with a count noun. Classifiers are used with count nouns; measure words can be used with mass nouns (e.g. &quot;two pints of mud&quot;), and can also be used when a count noun&#x27;s quantity is not described in terms of its inherent countable units (e.g. &quot;two pints of acorns&quot;).

However, the terminological distinction between classifiers and measure words is often blurred – classifiers are commonly referred to as measure words in some contexts, such as Chinese language teaching, and measure words are sometimes called &quot;mass-classifiers&quot; or similar.

<doc id="48334" wikidata="Q169342" url="?curid=48334" title="Retina">
<text>The retina (; or retinas) is the innermost, light-sensitive layer of tissue of the eye of most vertebrates and some molluscs. The optics of the eye create a focused two-dimensional image of the visual world on the retina, which then processes that image within the retina and sends nerve impulses along the optic nerve to the visual cortex to create visual perception. The retina serves a function which is in many ways analogous to that of the film or image sensor in a camera.

The neural retina consists of several layers of neurons interconnected by synapses and is supported by an outer layer of pigmented epithelial cells. The primary light-sensing cells in the retina are the photoreceptor cells, which are of two types: rods and cones. Rods function mainly in dim light and provide monochromatic vision. Cones function in well-lit conditions and are responsible for the perception of colour through the use of a range of opsins, as well as high-acuity vision used for tasks such as reading. A third type of light-sensing cell, the photosensitive ganglion cell, is important for entrainment of circadian rhythms and reflexive responses such as the pupillary light reflex.

Light striking the retina initiates a cascade of chemical and electrical events that ultimately trigger nerve impulses that are sent to various visual centres of the brain through the fibres of the optic nerve. Neural signals from the rods and cones undergo processing by other neurons, whose output takes the form of action potentials in retinal ganglion cells whose axons form the optic nerve.

In vertebrate embryonic development, the retina and the optic nerve originate as outgrowths of the developing brain, specifically the embryonic diencephalon; thus, the retina is considered part of the central nervous system (CNS) and is actually brain tissue. It is the only part of the CNS that can be visualized noninvasively. Like most of the brain, the retina is isolated from the vascular system by the blood–brain barrier. The retina is the part of the body with the greatest continuous energy demand.

== Structure ==

=== Inverted versus non-inverted retina ===
The vertebrate retina is &quot;inverted&quot; in the sense that the light-sensing cells are in the back of the retina, so that light has to pass through layers of neurons and capillaries before it reaches the photosensitive sections of the rods and cones. The ganglion cells, whose axons form the optic nerve, are at the front of the retina; therefore, the optic nerve must cross through the retina en route to the brain. No photoreceptors are in this region, giving rise to the blind spot. In contrast, in the cephalopod retina, the photoreceptors are in front, with processing neurons and capillaries behind them. Because of this, cephalopods do not have a blind spot.

Although the overlying neural tissue is partly transparent, and the accompanying glial cells have been shown to act as fibre-optic channels to transport photons directly to the photoreceptors, light scattering does occur. Some vertebrates, including humans, have an area of the central retina adapted for high-acuity vision. This area, termed the fovea centralis, is avascular (does not have blood vessels), and has minimal neural tissue in front of the photoreceptors, thereby minimizing light scattering.

The cephalopods have a non-inverted retina, which is comparable in resolving power to the eyes of many vertebrates. Squid eyes do not have an analog of the vertebrate retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Although their photoreceptors contain a protein, retinochrome, that recycles retinal and replicates one of the functions of the vertebrate RPE, cephalopod photoreceptors are likely not maintained as well as in vertebrates, and that as a result, the useful lifetime of photoreceptors in invertebrates is much shorter than in vertebrates. Having easily replaced stalk eyes (some lobsters) or retinae (some spiders, such as&quot; Deinopis&quot;) rarely occurs.

The cephalopod retina does not originate as an outgrowth of the brain, as the vertebrate one does. This difference suggests that vertebrate and cephalopod eyes are not homologous, but have evolved separately. From an evolutionary perspective, a more complex structure such as the inverted retina can generally come about as a consequence of two alternate processes - an advantageous &quot;good&quot; compromise between competing functional limitations, or as a historical maladaptive relic of the convoluted path of organ evolution and transformation. Vision is an important adaptation in higher vertebrates.

A third view of the &quot;inverted&quot; vertebrate eye is that it combines two benefits - the maintenance of the photoreceptors mentioned above, and the reduction in light intensity necessary to avoid blinding the photoreceptors, which are based on the extremely sensitive eyes of the ancestors of modern hagfish (fish that live in very deep, dark water).

A recent study on the evolutionary purpose for the inverted retina structure from the APS (American Physical Society) says that &quot;The directional of glial cells helps increase the clarity of human vision. But we also noticed something rather curious: the colours that best passed through the glial cells were green to red, which the eye needs most for daytime vision. The eye usually receives too much blue—and thus has fewer blue-sensitive cones.

Further computer simulations showed that green and red are concentrated five to ten times more by the glial cells, and into their respective cones, than blue light. Instead, excess blue light gets scattered to the surrounding rods. This optimization is such that color vision during the day is enhanced, while night-time vision suffers very little&quot;.

=== Retinal layers ===

The vertebrate retina has 10 distinct layers. From closest to farthest from the vitreous body:

# Inner limiting membrane – basement membrane elaborated by Müller cells
# Nerve fiber layer – axons of the ganglion cell bodies (a thin layer of Müller cell footplates exists between this layer and the inner limiting membrane)
# Ganglion cell layer – contains nuclei of ganglion cells, the axons of which become the optic nerve fibres, and some displaced amacrine cells
# Inner plexiform layer – contains the synapse between the bipolar cell axons and the dendrites of the ganglion and amacrine cells
# Inner nuclear layer – contains the nuclei and surrounding cell bodies (perikarya) of the amacrine cells, bipolar cells, and horizontal cells
# Outer plexiform layer – projections of rods and cones ending in the rod spherule and cone pedicle, respectively, these make synapses with dendrites of bipolar cells and horizontal cells. In the macular region, this is known as the f&quot;iber layer of Henle&quot;.
# Outer nuclear layer – cell bodies of rods and cones
# External limiting membrane – layer that separates the inner segment portions of the photoreceptors from their cell nuclei
# Inner segment / outer segment layer – inner segments and outer segments of rods and cones, the outer segments contain a highly specialized light-sensing apparatus. 
# Retinal pigment epithelium – single layer of cuboidal epithelial cells (with extrusions not shown in diagram). This layer is closest to the choroid, and provides nourishment and supportive functions to the neural retina, The black pigment melanin in the pigment layer prevents light reflection throughout the globe of the eyeball; this is extremely important for clear vision.

These layers can be grouped into four main processing stages—photoreception; transmission to bipolar cells; transmission to ganglion cells, which also contain photoreceptors, the photosensitive ganglion cells; and transmission along the optic nerve. At each synaptic stage, horizontal and amacrine cells also are laterally connected.

The optic nerve is a central tract of many axons of ganglion cells connecting primarily to the lateral geniculate body, a visual relay station in the diencephalon (the rear of the forebrain). It also projects to the superior colliculus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and the nucleus of the optic tract. It passes through the other layers, creating the optic disc in primates.

Additional structures, not directly associated with vision, are found as outgrowths of the retina in some vertebrate groups. In birds, the pecten is a vascular structure of complex shape that projects from the retina into the vitreous humour; it supplies oxygen and nutrients to the eye, and may also aid in vision. Reptiles have a similar, but much simpler, structure.

In adult humans, the entire retina is about 72% of a sphere about 22 mm in diameter. The entire retina contains about 7 million cones and 75 to 150 million rods. The optic disc, a part of the retina sometimes called &quot;the blind spot&quot; because it lacks photoreceptors, is located at the optic papilla, where the optic-nerve fibres leave the eye. It appears as an oval white area of 3 mm2. Temporal (in the direction of the temples) to this disc is the macula, at whose centre is the fovea, a pit that is responsible for sharp central vision, but is actually less sensitive to light because of its lack of rods. Human and non-human primates possess one fovea, as opposed to certain bird species, such as hawks, that are bifoviate, and dogs and cats, that possess no fovea, but a central band known as the visual streak. Around the fovea extends the central retina for about 6 mm and then the peripheral retina. The farthest edge of the retina is defined by the ora serrata. The distance from one ora to the other (or macula), the most sensitive area along the horizontal meridian, is about 32 mm.

In section, the retina is no more than 0.5 mm thick. It has three layers of nerve cells and two of synapses, including the unique ribbon synapse. The optic nerve carries the ganglion-cell axons to the brain, and the blood vessels that supply the retina. The ganglion cells lie innermost in the eye while the photoreceptive cells lie beyond. Because of this counter-intuitive arrangement, light must first pass through and around the ganglion cells and through the thickness of the retina, (including its capillary vessels, not shown) before reaching the rods and cones. Light is absorbed by the retinal pigment epithelium or the choroid (both of which are opaque).

The white blood cells in the capillaries in front of the photoreceptors can be perceived as tiny bright moving dots when looking into blue light. This is known as the blue field entoptic phenomenon (or Scheerer&#x27;s phenomenon).

Between the ganglion-cell layer and the rods and cones are two layers of neuropils, where synaptic contacts are made. The neuropil layers are the outer plexiform layer and the inner plexiform layer. In the outer neuropil layer, the rods and cones connect to the vertically running bipolar cells, and the horizontally oriented horizontal cells connect to ganglion cells.

The central retina predominantly contains cones, while the peripheral retina predominantly contains rods. In total, the retina has about seven million cones and a hundred million rods. At the centre of the macula is the foveal pit where the cones are narrow and long, and arranged in a hexagonal mosaic, the most dense, in contradistinction to the much fatter cones located more peripherally in the retina. At the foveal pit, the other retinal layers are displaced, before building up along the foveal slope until the rim of the fovea, or parafovea, is reached, which is the thickest portion of the retina. The macula has a yellow pigmentation, from screening pigments, and is known as the macula lutea. The area directly surrounding the fovea has the highest density of rods converging on single bipolar cells. Since its cones have a much lesser convergence of signals, the fovea allows for the sharpest vision the eye can attain.

Though the rod and cones are a mosaic of sorts, transmission from receptors, to bipolars, to ganglion cells is not direct. Since about 150 million receptors and only 1 million optic nerve fibres exist, convergence and thus mixing of signals must occur. Moreover, the horizontal action of the horizontal and amacrine cells can allow one area of the retina to control another (e.g. one stimulus inhibiting another). This inhibition is key to lessening the sum of messages sent to the higher regions of the brain. In some lower vertebrates (e.g. the pigeon), control of messages is &quot;centrifugal&quot; – that is, one layer can control another, or higher regions of the brain can drive the retinal nerve cells, but in primates, this does not occur.

==== Layers imagable with optical coherence tomography ====
Using optical coherence tomography (OCT), at least 13 layers can be identified in the retina. The layers and anatomical correlation are:


From innermost to outermost, the layers identifiable by OCT are as follows:

=== Development ===
Retinal development begins with the establishment of the eye fields mediated by the SHH and SIX3 proteins, with subsequent development of the optic vesicles regulated by the PAX6 and LHX2 proteins. The role of Pax6 in eye development was elegantly demonstrated by Walter Gehring and colleagues, who showed that ectopic expression of Pax6 can lead to eye formation on Drosophila antennae, wings, and legs. The optic vesicle gives rise to three structures: the neural retina, the retinal pigmented epithelium, and the optic stalk. The neural retina contains the retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) that give rise to the seven cell types of the retina. Differentiation begins with the retinal ganglion cells and concludes with production of the Muller glia. Although each cell type differentiates from the RPCs in a sequential order, there is considerable overlap in the timing of when individual cell types differentiate. The cues that determine a RPC daughter cell fate are coded by multiple transcription factor families including the bHLH and homeodomain factors.

In addition to guiding cell fate determination, cues exist in the retina to determine the dorsal-ventral (D-V) and nasal-temporal (N-T) axes. The D-V axis is established by a ventral to dorsal gradient of VAX2, whereas the N-T axis is coordinated by expression of the forkhead transcription factors FOXD1 and FOXG1. Additional gradients are formed within the retina. This spatial distribution may aid in proper targeting of RGC axons that function to establish the retinotopic map.

=== Blood supply ===


The retina is stratified into distinct layers, each containing specific cell types or cellular compartments that have metabolisms with different nutritional requirements. To satisfy these requirements, the ophthalmic artery bifurcates and supplies the retina via two distinct vascular networks: the choroidal network, which supplies the choroid and the outer retina, and the retinal network, which supplies the retina&#x27;s inner layer.

Although the inverted retina of vertebrates appears counter-intuitive, it is necessary for the proper functioning of the retina. The photoreceptor layer must be embedded in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which performs at least seven vital functions, one of the most obvious being to supply oxygen and other necessary nutrients needed for the photoreceptors to function.

====Energy requirements====
The energy requirements of the retina are even greater than that of the brain. This is due to the additional energy needed to continuously renew the photoreceptor outer segments, of which 10% are shed daily. Energy demands are greatest during dark adaptation when its sensitivity is most enhanced. The choroid supplies about 75% of these nutrients to the retina and the retinal vasculature only 25%.

When light strikes 11-cis-retinal (in the disks in the rods and cones), 11-cis-retinal changes to all-trans-retinal which then triggers changes in the opsins. Now, the outer segments do not regenerate the retinal back into the cis- form once it has been changed by light. Instead the retinal is pumped out to the surrounding RPE where it is regenerated and transported back into the outer segments of the photoreceptors. This recycling function of the RPE protects the photoreceptors against photo-oxidative damage and allows the photoreceptor cells to have decades-long useful lives.

==== In birds ====
The bird retina is devoid of blood vessels, perhaps to give unobscured passage of light for forming images, thus giving better resolution. It is, therefore, a considered view that the bird retina depends for nutrition and oxygen supply on a specialized organ, called the &quot;pecten&quot; or pecten oculi, located on the blind spot or optic disk. This organ is extremely rich in blood vessels and is thought to supply nutrition and oxygen to the bird retina by diffusion through the vitreous body. The pecten is highly rich in alkaline phosphatase activity and polarized cells in its bridge portion – both befitting its secretory role. Pecten cells are packed with dark melanin granules, which have been theorized to keep this organ warm with the absorption of stray light falling on the pecten. This is considered to enhance metabolic rate of the pecten, thereby exporting more nutritive molecules to meet the stringent energy requirements of the retina during long periods of exposure to light.

=== Biometric identification and diagnosis of disease ===
The bifurcations and other physical characteristics of the inner retinal vascular network are known to vary among individuals, and these individual variances have been used for biometric identification and for early detection of the onset of disease. The mapping of vascular bifurcations is one of the basic steps in biometric identification. Results of such analyses of retinal blood vessel structure can be evaluated against the ground truth data of vascular bifurcations of retinal fundus images that are obtained from the DRIVE dataset. In addition, the classes of vessels of the DRIVE dataset have also been identified, and an automated method for accurate extraction of these bifurcations is also available. Changes in retinal blood circulation are seen with aging and exposure to air pollution, and may indicate cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and atherosclerosis. Determining the equivalent width of arterioles and venules near the optic disc is also a widely used technique to identify cardiovascular risks.

== Function ==
The retina translates an optical image into neural impulses starting with the patterned excitation of the colour-sensitive pigments of its rods and cones, the retina&#x27;s photoreceptor cells. The excitation is processed by the neural system and various parts of the brain working in parallel to form a representation of the external environment in the brain.

The cones respond to bright light and mediate high-resolution colour vision during daylight illumination (also called photopic vision). The rod responses are saturated at daylight levels and do not contribute to pattern vision. However, rods do respond to dim light and mediate lower-resolution, monochromatic vision under very low levels of illumination (called scotopic vision). The illumination in most office settings falls between these two levels and is called mesopic vision. At mesopic light levels, both the rods and cones are actively contributing pattern information. What contribution the rod information makes to pattern vision under these circumstances is unclear.

The response of cones to various wavelengths of light is called their spectral sensitivity. In normal human vision, the spectral sensitivity of a cone falls into one of three subtypes, often called blue, green, and red, but more accurately known as short, medium, and long wavelength-sensitive cone subtypes. It is a lack of one or more of the cone subtypes that causes individuals to have deficiencies in colour vision or various kinds of colour blindness. These individuals are not blind to objects of a particular colour, but are unable to distinguish between colours that can be distinguished by people with normal vision. Humans have this trichromatic vision, while most other mammals lack cones with red sensitive pigment and therefore have poorer dichromatic colour vision. However, some animals have four spectral subtypes, e.g. the trout adds an ultraviolet subgroup to short, medium, and long subtypes that are similar to humans. Some fish are sensitive to the polarization of light as well.

In the photoreceptors, exposure to light hyperpolarizes the membrane in a series of graded shifts. The outer cell segment contains a photopigment. Inside the cell the normal levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) keep the Na+ channel open, and thus in the resting state the cell is depolarised. The photon causes the retinal bound to the receptor protein to isomerise to trans-retinal. This causes the receptor to activate multiple G-proteins. This in turn causes the Ga-subunit of the protein to activate a phosphodiesterase (PDE6), which degrades cGMP, resulting in the closing of Na+ cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNGs). Thus the cell is hyperpolarised. The amount of neurotransmitter released is reduced in bright light and increases as light levels fall. The actual photopigment is bleached away in bright light and only replaced as a chemical process, so in a transition from bright light to darkness the eye can take up to thirty minutes to reach full sensitivity.

When thus excited by light, the photoceptor sends a proportional response synaptically to bipolar cells which in turn signal the retinal ganglion cells. The photoreceptors are also cross-linked by horizontal cells and amacrine cells, which modify the synaptic signal before it reaches the ganglion cells, the neural signals being intermixed and combined. Of the retina&#x27;s nerve cells, only the retinal ganglion cells and few amacrine cells create action potentials.

In the retinal ganglion cells there are two types of response, depending on the receptive field of the cell. The receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells comprise a central, approximately circular area, where light has one effect on the firing of the cell, and an annular surround, where light has the opposite effect. In ON cells, an increment in light intensity in the centre of the receptive field causes the firing rate to increase. In OFF cells, it makes it decrease. In a linear model, this response profile is well described by a difference of Gaussians and is the basis for edge detection algorithms. Beyond this simple difference, ganglion cells are also differentiated by chromatic sensitivity and the type of spatial summation. Cells showing linear spatial summation are termed X cells (also called parvocellular, P, or midget ganglion cells), and those showing non-linear summation are Y cells (also called magnocellular, M, or parasol retinal ganglion cells), although the correspondence between X and Y cells (in the cat retina) and P and M cells (in the primate retina) is not as simple as it once seemed.

In the transfer of visual signals to the brain, the visual pathway, the retina is vertically divided in two, a temporal (nearer to the temple) half and a nasal (nearer to the nose) half. The axons from the nasal half cross the brain at the optic chiasma to join with axons from the temporal half of the other eye before passing into the lateral geniculate body.

Although there are more than 130 million retinal receptors, there are only approximately 1.2 million fibres (axons) in the optic nerve. So, a large amount of pre-processing is performed within the retina. The fovea produces the most accurate information. Despite occupying about 0.01% of the visual field (less than 2° of visual angle), about 10% of axons in the optic nerve are devoted to the fovea. The resolution limit of the fovea has been determined to be around 10,000 points. The information capacity is estimated at 500,000 bits per second (for more information on bits, see information theory) without colour or around 600,000 bits per second including colour.

=== Spatial encoding ===

When the retina sends neural impulses representing an image to the brain, it spatially encodes (compresses) those impulses to fit the limited capacity of the optic nerve. Compression is necessary because there are 100 times more photoreceptor cells than ganglion cells. This is done by &quot;decorrelation&quot;, which is carried out by the &quot;centre–surround structures&quot;, which are implemented by the bipolar and ganglion cells.

There are two types of centre–surround structures in the retina – on-centres and off-centres. On-centres have a positively weighted centre and a negatively weighted surround. Off-centres are just the opposite. Positive weighting is more commonly known as excitatory, and negative weighting as inhibitory.

These centre–surround structures are not physical apparent, in the sense that one cannot see them by staining samples of tissue and examining the retina&#x27;s anatomy. The centre–surround structures are logical (i.e., mathematically abstract) in the sense that they depend on the connection strengths between bipolar and ganglion cells. It is believed that the connection strength between cells is caused by the number and types of ion channels embedded in the synapses between the bipolar and ganglion cells.

The centre–surround structures are mathematically equivalent to the edge detection algorithms used by computer programmers to extract or enhance the edges in a digital photograph. Thus, the retina performs operations on the image-representing impulses to enhance the edges of objects within its visual field. For example, in a picture of a dog, a cat and a car, it is the edges of these objects that contain the most information. In order for higher functions in the brain (or in a computer for that matter) to extract and classify objects such as a dog and a cat, the retina is the first step to separating out the various objects within the scene.

As an example, the following matrix is at the heart of a computer algorithm that implements edge detection. This matrix is the computer equivalent to the centre–surround structure. In this example, each box (element) within this matrix would be connected to one photoreceptor. The photoreceptor in the centre is the current receptor being processed. The centre photoreceptor is multiplied by the +1 weight factor. The surrounding photoreceptors are the &quot;nearest neighbors&quot; to the centre and are multiplied by the −1/8 value. The sum of all nine of these elements is finally calculated. This summation is repeated for every photoreceptor in the image by shifting left to the end of a row and then down to the next line.

The total sum of this matrix is zero, if all the inputs from the nine photoreceptors are of the same value. The zero result indicates the image was uniform (non-changing) within this small patch. Negative or positive sums mean the image was varying (changing) within this small patch of nine photoreceptors.

The above matrix is only an approximation to what really happens inside the retina. The differences are:
* The above example is called &quot;balanced&quot;. The term balanced means that the sum of the negative weights is equal to the sum of the positive weights so that they cancel out perfectly. Retinal ganglion cells are almost never perfectly balanced.
* The table is square while the centre–surround structures in the retina are circular.
* Neurons operate on spike trains traveling down nerve cell axons. Computers operate on a single floating-point number that is essentially constant from each input pixel. (The computer pixel is basically the equivalent of a biological photoreceptor.)
* The retina performs all these calculations in parallel while the computer operates on each pixel one at a time. The retina performs no repeated summations and shifting as would a computer.
* Finally, the horizontal and amacrine cells play a significant role in this process, but that is not represented here.

Here is an example of an input image and how edge detection would modify it.

Once the image is spatially encoded by the centre–surround structures, the signal is sent out along the optic nerve (via the axons of the ganglion cells) through the optic chiasm to the LGN (lateral geniculate nucleus). The exact function of the LGN is unknown at this time. The output of the LGN is then sent to the back of the brain. Specifically, the output of the LGN &quot;radiates&quot; out to the V1 primary visual cortex.

Simplified signal flow: Photoreceptors → Bipolar → Ganglion → Chiasm → LGN → V1 cortex

== Clinical significance ==
There are many inherited and acquired diseases or disorders that may affect the retina. Some of them include:
* Retinitis pigmentosa is a group of genetic diseases that affect the retina and cause the loss of night vision and peripheral vision.
* Macular degeneration describes a group of diseases characterized by loss of central vision because of death or impairment of the cells in the macula.
* Cone-rod dystrophy (CORD) describes a number of diseases where vision loss is caused by deterioration of the cones and/or rods in the retina.
* In retinal separation, the retina detaches from the back of the eyeball. Ignipuncture is an outdated treatment method. The term retinal detachment is used to describe a separation of the neurosensory retina from the retinal pigment epithelium. There are several modern treatment methods for fixing a retinal detachment: pneumatic retinopexy, scleral buckle, cryotherapy, laser photocoagulation and pars plana vitrectomy.
* Both hypertension and diabetes mellitus can cause damage to the tiny blood vessels that supply the retina, leading to hypertensive retinopathy and diabetic retinopathy.
* Retinoblastoma is a cancer of the retina.
* Retinal diseases in dogs include retinal dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy, and sudden acquired retinal degeneration.
* &quot;Lipaemia retinalis&quot; is a white appearance of the retina, and can occur by lipid deposition in lipoprotein lipase deficiency.
* &quot;Retinal Detachment&quot;. The neural retina occasionally detaches from the pigment epithelium. In some instances, the cause of such detachment is injury to the eyeball that allows fluid or blood to collect between the neural retina and the pigment epithelium. Detachment is occasionally caused by contracture of fine collagenous fibrils in the vitreous humor, which pull areas of the retina toward the interior of the globe.
* &quot;Night blindness&quot;: Night blindness occurs in any person with severe vitamin A deficiency. The reason for this is that without vitamin A, the amounts of retinal and rhodopsin that can be formed are severely depressed. This condition is called night blindness because the amount of light available at night is too little to permit adequate vision in vitamin A–deficient persons.

In addition, the retina has been described as a &quot;window&quot; into the brain and body, given that abnormalities detected through an examination of the retina can discover both neurological and systemic diseases.

=== Diagnosis ===
A number of different instruments are available for the diagnosis of diseases and disorders affecting the retina. Ophthalmoscopy and fundus photography have long been used to examine the retina. Recently, adaptive optics has been used to image individual rods and cones in the living human retina, and a company based in Scotland has engineered technology that allows physicians to observe the complete retina without any discomfort to patients.

The electroretinogram is used to non-invasively measure the retina&#x27;s electrical activity, which is affected by certain diseases. A relatively new technology, now becoming widely available, is optical coherence tomography (OCT). This non-invasive technique allows one to obtain a 3D volumetric or high resolution cross-sectional tomogram of the fine structures of the retina, with histologic quality. Retinal vessel analysis is a non-invasive method to examine the small arteries and veins in the retina which allows to draw conclusions about the morphology and the function of small vessels elsewhere in the human body. It has been established as a predictor of cardiovascular disease and seems to have, according to a study published in 2019, potential in the early detection of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

=== Treatment ===
Treatment depends upon the nature of the disease or disorder.

==== Common treatment modalities ====
The following are commonly modalities of management for retinal disease:
* Intravitreal medication, such as anti-VEGF or corticosteroid agents
* Vitreoretinal surgery
* Use of nutritional supplements
* Modification of systemic risk factors for retinal disease

==== Uncommon treatment modalities ====
Retinal gene therapy
Gene therapy holds promise as a potential avenue to cure a wide range of retinal diseases. This involves using a non-infectious virus to shuttle a gene into a part of the retina. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors possess a number of features that render them ideally suited for retinal gene therapy, including a lack of pathogenicity, minimal immunogenicity, and the ability to transduce postmitotic cells in a stable and efficient manner. rAAV vectors are increasingly utilized for their ability to mediate efficient transduction of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), photoreceptor cells and retinal ganglion cells. Each cell type can be specifically targeted by choosing the appropriate combination of AAV serotype, promoter, and intraocular injection site.

Several clinical trials have already reported positive results using rAAV to treat Leber&#x27;s congenital amaurosis, showing that the therapy was both safe and effective. There were no serious adverse events, and patients in all three studies showed improvement in their visual function as measured by a number of methods. The methods used varied among the three trials, but included both functional methods such as visual acuity and functional mobility as well as objective measures that are less susceptible to bias, such as the pupil&#x27;s ability to respond to light and improvements on functional MRI. Improvements were sustained over the long-term, with patients continuing to do well after more than 1.5 years.

The unique architecture of the retina and its relatively immune-privileged environment help this process. Tight junctions that form the blood retinal barrier separate the subretinal space from the blood supply, thus protecting it from microbes and most immune-mediated damage, and enhancing its potential to respond to vector-mediated therapies. The highly compartmentalized anatomy of the eye facilitates accurate delivery of therapeutic vector suspensions to specific tissues under direct visualization using microsurgical techniques. In the sheltered environment of the retina, AAV vectors are able to maintain high levels of transgene expression in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), photoreceptors, or ganglion cells for long periods of time after a single treatment. In addition, the eye and the visual system can be routinely and easily monitored for visual function and retinal structural changes after injections with noninvasive advanced technology, such as visual acuities, contrast sensitivity, fundus auto-fluorescence (FAF), dark-adapted visual thresholds, vascular diameters, pupillometry, electroretinography (ERG), multifocal ERG and optical coherence tomography (OCT).

This strategy is effective against a number of retinal diseases that have been studied, including neovascular diseases that are features of age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity. Since the regulation of vascularization in the mature retina involves a balance between endogenous positive growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inhibitors of angiogenesis, such as pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), rAAV-mediated expression of PEDF, angiostatin, and the soluble VEGF receptor sFlt-1, which are all antiangiogenic proteins, have been shown to reduce aberrant vessel formation in animal models. Since specific gene therapies cannot readily be used to treat a significant fraction of patients with retinal dystrophy, there is a major interest in developing a more generally applicable survival factor therapy. Neurotrophic factors have the ability to modulate neuronal growth during development to maintain existing cells and to allow recovery of injured neuronal populations in the eye. AAV encoding neurotrophic factors such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family members and GDNF either protected photoreceptors from apoptosis or slowed down cell death.

Organ transplantation
Transplantation of retinas has been attempted, but without much success. At MIT, The University of Southern California, RWTH Aachen University, and the University of New South Wales, an &quot;artificial retina&quot; is under development: an implant which will bypass the photoreceptors of the retina and stimulate the attached nerve cells directly, with signals from a digital camera.

== History ==
Around 300 BCE, Herophilos identified the retina from dissections of cadaver eyes. He called it the &quot;arachnoid&quot; layer, from its resemblance to a spider web, and &quot;retiform&quot;, from its resemblance to a casting net. The term arachnoid came to refer to a layer around the brain; the term &quot;retiform&quot; came to refer to the &quot;retina&quot;.

Between 1011 and 1021 CE, Ibn Al-Haytham published numerous experiments demonstrating that sight occurs from light reflecting from objects into the eye. This is consistent with intromission theory and against emission theory, the theory that sight occurs from rays emitted by the eyes. However, Ibn Al-Haytham decided that the retina could not be responsible for the beginnings of vision because the image formed on it was inverted. Instead he decided it must begin at the surface of the lens.

In 1604, Johannes Kepler worked out the optics of the eye and decided that the retina must be where sight begins. He left it up to other scientists to reconcile the inverted retinal image with our perception of the world as upright.

In 1894, Santiago Ramón y Cajal published the first major characterization of retinal neurons in &quot;Retina der Wirbelthiere&quot; (&quot;The Retina of Vertebrates&quot;).

George Wald, Haldan Keffer Hartline, and Ragnar Granit won the 1967 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their scientific research on the retina.

A recent University of Pennsylvania study calculated that the approximate bandwidth of human retinas is 8.75 megabits per second, whereas a guinea pig&#x27;s retinal transfer rate is 875 kilobits per second.

MacLaren &amp; Pearson and colleagues at University College London and Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, in 2006, showed that photoreceptor cells could be transplanted successfully in the mouse retina if donor cells were at a critical developmental stage. Recently Ader and colleagues in Dublin showed, using the electron microscope, that transplanted photoreceptors formed synaptic connections.

In 2012, Sebastian Seung and his laboratory at MIT launched EyeWire, an online Citizen science game where players trace neurons in the retina. The goals of the EyeWire project are to identify specific cell types within the known broad classes of retinal cells, and to map the connections between neurons in the retina, which will help to determine how vision works.

<text>An electrolyte is a substance that conducts electricity through the movement of ions, but not through the movement of electrons. This includes most soluble salts, acids, and bases, dissolved in a polar solvent like water. Upon dissolving, the substance separates into cations and anions, which disperse uniformly throughout the solvent. Solid-state electrolytes also exist. In medicine and sometimes in chemistry, the term electrolyte refers to the substance that is dissolved.

Electrically, such a solution is neutral. If an electric potential is applied to such a solution, the cations of the solution are drawn to the electrode that has an abundance of electrons, while the anions are drawn to the electrode that has a deficit of electrons. The movement of anions and cations in opposite directions within the solution amounts to a current. Some gases, such as hydrogen chloride (HCL), under conditions of high temperature or low pressure can also function as electrolytes. Electrolyte solutions can also result from the dissolution of some biological (e.g., DNA, polypeptides) or synthetic polymers (e.g., polystyrene sulfonate), termed &quot;polyelectrolytes&quot;, which contain charged functional groups. A substance that dissociates into ions in solution or in the melt acquires the capacity to conduct electricity. Sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate in a liquid phase are examples of electrolytes.

In medicine, electrolyte replacement is needed when a person has prolonged vomiting or diarrhea, and as a response to sweating due to strenuous athletic activity. Commercial electrolyte solutions are available, particularly for sick children (such as oral rehydration solution, Suero Oral, or Pedialyte) and athletes (sports drinks). Electrolyte monitoring is important in the treatment of anorexia and bulimia.

In science, electrolytes are one of the main components of electrochemical cells.

In clinical medicine, mentions of electrolytes usually refer metonymically to the ions, and (especially) to their concentrations (in blood, serum, urine, or other fluids). Thus, mentions of electrolyte levels usually refer to the various ion concentrations, not to the fluid volumes.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;electrolyte&quot; derives from Ancient Greek ήλεκτρο- (&quot;ēlectro&quot;-), prefix originally meaning &quot;amber&quot; but in modern contexts related to electricity, and λυτός (&quot;lytos&quot;), meaning &quot;able to be untied or loosened&quot;.

== History ==

In his 1884 dissertation, Svante Arrhenius put forth his explanation of solid crystalline salts disassociating into paired charged particles when dissolved, for which he won the 1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Arrhenius&#x27;s explanation was that in forming a solution, the salt dissociates into charged particles, to which Michael Faraday (1791-1867) had given the name &quot;ions&quot; many years earlier. Faraday&#x27;s belief had been that ions were produced in the process of electrolysis. Arrhenius proposed that, even in the absence of an electric current, solutions of salts contained ions. He thus proposed that chemical reactions in solution were reactions between ions.

Shortly after Arrhenius&#x27;s hypothesis of ions, Franz Hofmeister and Siegmund Lewith found that different ion types displayed different effects on such things as the solubility of proteins. A consistent ordering of these different ions on the magnitude of their effect arises consistently in many other systems as well. This has since become known as the Hofmeister series.

While the origins of these effects are not abundantly clear and have been debated throughout the past century, it has been suggested that the charge density of these ions is important and might actually have explanations originating from the work of Charles-Augustin de Coulomb over 200 years ago.

== Formation ==
Electrolyte solutions are normally formed when salt is placed into a solvent such as water and the individual components dissociate due to the thermodynamic interactions between solvent and solute molecules, in a process called &quot;solvation&quot;. For example, when table salt (sodium chloride), NaCl, is placed in water, the salt (a solid) dissolves into its component ions, according to the dissociation reaction:

: NaCl(s) → Na+(aq) + Cl−(aq)

It is also possible for substances to react with water, producing ions. For example, carbon dioxide gas dissolves in water to produce a solution that contains hydronium, carbonate, and hydrogen carbonate ions.

Molten salts can also be electrolytes as, for example, when sodium chloride is molten, the liquid conducts electricity. In particular, ionic liquids, which are molten salts with melting points below 100 °C, are a type of highly conductive non-aqueous electrolytes and thus have found more and more applications in fuel cells and batteries.

An electrolyte in a solution may be described as &quot;concentrated&quot; if it has a high concentration of ions, or &quot;dilute&quot; if it has a low concentration. If a high proportion of the solute dissociates to form free ions, the electrolyte is strong; if most of the solute does not dissociate, the electrolyte is weak. The properties of electrolytes may be exploited using electrolysis to extract constituent elements and compounds contained within the solution.

Alkaline earth metals form hydroxides that are strong electrolytes with limited solubility in water, due to the strong attraction between their constituent ions. This limits their application to situations where high solubility is required.

In 2021, researchers have found that electrolyte can &quot;substantially facilitate electrochemical corrosion studies in less conductive media&quot;.

== Physiological importance ==
In physiology, the primary ions of electrolytes are sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), chloride (Cl−), hydrogen phosphate (HPO42−), and hydrogen carbonate (HCO3−). The electric charge symbols of plus (+) and minus (−) indicate that the substance is ionic in nature and has an imbalanced distribution of electrons, the result of chemical dissociation. Sodium is the main electrolyte found in extracellular fluid and potassium is the main intracellular electrolyte; both are involved in fluid balance and blood pressure control.

All known multicellular lifeforms require a subtle and complex electrolyte balance between the intracellular and extracellular environments. In particular, the maintenance of precise osmotic gradients of electrolytes is important. Such gradients affect and regulate the hydration of the body as well as blood pH, and are critical for nerve and muscle function. Various mechanisms exist in living species that keep the concentrations of different electrolytes under tight control.

Both muscle tissue and neurons are considered electric tissues of the body. Muscles and neurons are activated by electrolyte activity between the extracellular fluid or interstitial fluid, and intracellular fluid. Electrolytes may enter or leave the cell membrane through specialized protein structures embedded in the plasma membrane called &quot;ion channels&quot;. For example, muscle contraction is dependent upon the presence of calcium (Ca2+), sodium (Na+), and potassium (K+). Without sufficient levels of these key electrolytes, muscle weakness or severe muscle contractions may occur.

Electrolyte balance is maintained by oral, or in emergencies, intravenous (IV) intake of electrolyte-containing substances, and is regulated by hormones, in general with the kidneys flushing out excess levels. In humans, electrolyte homeostasis is regulated by hormones such as antidiuretic hormones, aldosterone and parathyroid hormones. Serious electrolyte disturbances, such as dehydration and overhydration, may lead to cardiac and neurological complications and, unless they are rapidly resolved, will result in a medical emergency.

=== Measurement ===
Measurement of electrolytes is a commonly performed diagnostic procedure, performed via blood testing with ion-selective electrodes or urinalysis by medical technologists. The interpretation of these values is somewhat meaningless without analysis of the clinical history and is often impossible without parallel measurements of renal function. The electrolytes measured most often are sodium and potassium. Chloride levels are rarely measured except for arterial blood gas interpretations since they are inherently linked to sodium levels. One important test conducted on urine is the specific gravity test to determine the occurrence of an electrolyte imbalance.

=== Rehydration ===
According to a study paid for by the Gatorade Sports Science Institute, electrolyte drinks containing sodium and potassium salts replenish the body&#x27;s water and electrolyte concentrations after dehydration caused by exercise, excessive alcohol consumption, diaphoresis (heavy sweating), diarrhea, vomiting, intoxication or starvation; the study says that athletes exercising in extreme conditions (for three or more hours continuously, e.g. a marathon or triathlon) who do not consume electrolytes risk dehydration (or hyponatremia).

A home-made electrolyte drink can be made by using water, sugar and salt in precise proportions. It is important to include glucose (sugar) to utilise the co-transport mechanism of sodium and glucose. Commercial preparations are also available for both human and veterinary use.

Electrolytes are commonly found in fruit juices, sports drinks, milk, nuts, and many fruits and vegetables (whole or in juice form) (e.g., potatoes, avocados).

== Electrochemistry ==

When electrodes are placed in an electrolyte and a voltage is applied, the electrolyte will conduct electricity. Lone electrons normally cannot pass through the electrolyte; instead, a chemical reaction occurs at the cathode, providing electrons to the electrolyte. Another reaction occurs at the anode, consuming electrons from the electrolyte. As a result, a negative charge cloud develops in the electrolyte around the cathode, and a positive charge develops around the anode. The ions in the electrolyte neutralize these charges, enabling the electrons to keep flowing and the reactions to continue.

For example, in a solution of ordinary table salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) in water, the cathode reaction will be

: 2 H2O + 2e− → 2 OH− + H2

and hydrogen gas will bubble up; the anode reaction is

: 2 NaCl → 2 Na+ + Cl2 + 2e−

and chlorine gas will be liberated into solution where it reacts with the sodium and hydroxyl ions to produce sodium hypochlorite - household bleach. The positively charged sodium ions Na+ will react toward the cathode, neutralizing the negative charge of OH− there, and the negatively charged hydroxide ions OH− will react toward the anode, neutralizing the positive charge of Na+ there. Without the ions from the electrolyte, the charges around the electrode would slow down continued electron flow; diffusion of H+ and OH− through water to the other electrode takes longer than movement of the much more prevalent salt ions.
Electrolytes dissociate in water because water molecules are dipoles and the dipoles orient in an energetically favorable manner to solvate the ions.

In other systems, the electrode reactions can involve the metals of the electrodes as well as the ions of the electrolyte.

Electrolytic conductors are used in electronic devices where the chemical reaction at a metal-electrolyte interface yields useful effects.
* In batteries, two materials with different electron affinities are used as electrodes; electrons flow from one electrode to the other outside of the battery, while inside the battery the circuit is closed by the electrolyte&#x27;s ions. Here, the electrode reactions convert chemical energy to electrical energy.
* In some fuel cells, a solid electrolyte or proton conductor connects the plates electrically while keeping the hydrogen and oxygen fuel gases separated.
* In electroplating tanks, the electrolyte simultaneously deposits metal onto the object to be plated, and electrically connects that object in the circuit.
* In operation-hours gauges, two thin columns of mercury are separated by a small electrolyte-filled gap, and, as charge is passed through the device, the metal dissolves on one side and plates out on the other, causing the visible gap to slowly move along.
* In electrolytic capacitors the chemical effect is used to produce an extremely thin dielectric or insulating coating, while the electrolyte layer behaves as one capacitor plate.
* In some hygrometers the humidity of air is sensed by measuring the conductivity of a nearly dry electrolyte.
* Hot, softened glass is an electrolytic conductor, and some glass manufacturers keep the glass molten by passing a large current through it.

== Solid electrolytes ==

Solid electrolytes can be mostly divided into four groups described below.

=== Gel electrolytes ===
Gel electrolytes – closely resemble liquid electrolytes. In essence, they are liquids in a flexible lattice framework. Various additives are often applied to increase the conductivity of such systems.

=== Ceramic electrolytes ===
Solid ceramic electrolytes – ions migrate through the ceramic phase by means of vacancies or interstitials within the lattice. There are also glassy-ceramic electrolytes.

=== Polymer electrolytes ===

Dry polymer electrolytes differ from liquid and gel electrolytes in that salt is dissolved directly into the solid medium. Usually it is a relatively high-dielectric constant polymer (PEO, PMMA, PAN, polyphosphazenes, siloxanes, etc.) and a salt with low lattice energy. In order to increase the mechanical strength and conductivity of such electrolytes, very often composites are made, and inert ceramic phase is introduced. There are two major classes of such electrolytes: polymer-in-ceramic, and ceramic-in-polymer.

=== Organic plastic electrolytes ===
Organic ionic plastic crystals – are a type organic salts exhibiting mesophases (i.e. a state of matter intermediate between liquid and solid), in which mobile ions are orientationally or rotationally disordered while their centers are located at the ordered sites in the crystal structure. They have various forms of disorder due to one or more solid–solid phase transitions below the melting point and have therefore plastic properties and good mechanical flexibility as well as an improved electrode-electrolyte interfacial contact. In particular, protic organic ionic plastic crystals (POIPCs), which are solid protic organic salts formed by proton transfer from a Brønsted acid to a Brønsted base and in essence are protic ionic liquids in the molten state, have found to be promising solid-state proton conductors for fuel cells. Examples include 1,2,4-triazolium perfluorobutanesulfonate and imidazolium methanesulfonate.

<text>Caterpillars ( ) are the larval stage of members of the order Lepidoptera (the insect order comprising butterflies and moths).

As with most common names, the application of the word is arbitrary, since the larvae of sawflies (suborder Symphyta) are commonly called caterpillars as well. Both lepidopteran and symphytan larvae have eruciform body shapes.

Caterpillars of most species eat plant material (often leaves), but not all; some (about 1%) eat insects, and some are even cannibalistic. Some feed on other animal products. For example, clothes moths feed on wool, and horn moths feed on the hooves and horns of dead ungulates.

Caterpillars are typically voracious feeders and many of them are among the most serious of agricultural pests. In fact, many moth species are best known in their caterpillar stages because of the damage they cause to fruits and other agricultural produce, whereas the moths are obscure and do no direct harm. Conversely, various species of caterpillar are valued as sources of silk, as human or animal food, or for biological control of pest plants.

== Etymology ==

The origins of the word &quot;caterpillar&quot; date from the early 16th century. They derive from Middle English &quot;catirpel&quot;, &quot;catirpeller&quot;, probably an alteration of Old North French &quot;catepelose&quot;: &quot;cate&quot;, cat (from Latin &quot;cattus&quot;) + &quot;pelose&quot;, hairy (from Latin &quot;pilōsus&quot;).

The inchworm, or looper caterpillars from the family Geometridae are so named because of the way they move, appearing to measure the earth (the word &quot;geometrid&quot; means &quot;earth-measurer&quot; in Greek); the primary reason for this unusual locomotion is the elimination of nearly all the prolegs except the clasper on the terminal segment.

== Description ==


Caterpillars have soft bodies that can grow rapidly between moults. Their size varies between species and instars (moults) from as small as up to . Some larvae of the order Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps) can appear like the caterpillars of the Lepidoptera. Such larvae are mainly seen in the sawfly suborder. However while these larvae superficially resemble caterpillars, they can be distinguished by the presence of prolegs on every abdominal segment, an absence of crochets or hooks on the prolegs (these are present on lepidopteran caterpillars), one pair of prominent ocelli on the head capsule, and an absence of the upside-down Y-shaped suture on the front of the head.

Lepidopteran caterpillars can be differentiated from sawfly larvae by:
* the numbers of pairs of pro-legs; sawfly larvae have 6 or more pairs while caterpillars have a maximum of 5 pairs.
* the number of stemmata (simple eyes); the sawfly larvae have only two, while caterpillars usually have twelve (six each side of the head).
* the presence of crochets on the prolegs; these are absent in the sawflies.
* sawfly larvae have an invariably smooth head capsule with no cleavage lines, while lepidopterous caterpillars bear an inverted &quot;Y&quot; or &quot;V&quot; (frontal suture).

=== Fossils ===
In 2019, a geometrid moth caterpillar dating back to the Eocene epoch, approximately 44 million years ago, was found preserved in Baltic amber. It was described under &quot;Eogeometer vadens&quot;. Previously, another fossil dating back approximately 125 million years was found in Lebanese amber.

== Defenses ==

Many animals feed on caterpillars as they are rich in protein. As a result, caterpillars have evolved various means of defense.

Caterpillars have evolved defenses against physical conditions such as cold, hot or dry environmental conditions. Some Arctic species like &quot;Gynaephora groenlandica&quot; have special basking and aggregation behaviours apart from physiological adaptations to remain in a dormant state.

=== Appearance ===

The appearance of a caterpillar can often repel a predator: its markings and certain body parts can make it seem poisonous, or bigger in size and thus threatening, or non-edible. Some types of caterpillars are indeed poisonous or distasteful and their bright coloring warns predators of this. Others may mimic dangerous caterpillars or other animals while not being dangerous themselves. Many caterpillars are cryptically colored and resemble the plants on which they feed. An example of caterpillars that use camouflage for defense is the species &quot;Nemoria arizonaria&quot;. If the caterpillars hatch in the spring and feed on oak catkins they appear green. If they hatch in the summer they appear dark colored, like oak twigs. The differential development is linked to the tannin content in the diet. Caterpillars may even have spines or growths that resemble plant parts such as thorns. Some look like objects in the environment such as bird droppings. Some Geometridae cover themselves in plant parts, while bagworms construct and live in a bag covered in sand, pebbles or plant material.

=== Chemical defenses ===

More aggressive self-defense measures have evolved in some caterpillars. These measures include having spiny bristles or long fine hair-like setae with detachable tips that will irritate by lodging in the skin or mucous membranes. However some birds (such as cuckoos) will swallow even the hairiest of caterpillars. Other caterpillars acquire toxins from their host plants that render them unpalatable to most of their predators. For instance, ornate moth caterpillars utilize pyrrolizidine alkaloids that they obtain from their food plants to deter predators. The most aggressive caterpillar defenses are bristles associated with venom glands. These bristles are called urticating hairs. A venom which is among the most potent defensive chemicals in any animal is produced by the South American silk moth genus &quot;Lonomia&quot;. Its venom is an anticoagulant powerful enough to cause a human to hemorrhage to death (See Lonomiasis). This chemical is being investigated for potential medical applications. Most urticating hairs range in effect from mild irritation to dermatitis. Example: brown-tail moth.

Plants contain toxins which protect them from herbivores, but some caterpillars have evolved countermeasures which enable them to eat the leaves of such toxic plants. In addition to being unaffected by the poison, the caterpillars it in their body, making them highly toxic to predators. The chemicals are also carried on into the adult stages. These toxic species, such as the cinnabar moth (&quot;Tyria jacobaeae&quot;) and monarch (&quot;Danaus plexippus&quot;) caterpillars, usually advertise themselves with the danger colors of red, yellow and black, often in bright stripes (see aposematism). Any predator that attempts to eat a caterpillar with an aggressive defense mechanism will learn and avoid future attempts.

Some caterpillars regurgitate acidic digestive juices at attacking enemies. Many papilionid larvae produce bad smells from extrudable glands called osmeteria.

=== Defensive behaviors ===

Many caterpillars display feeding behaviors which allow the caterpillar to remain hidden from potential predators. Many feed in protected environments, such as enclosed inside silk galleries, rolled leaves or by mining between the leaf surfaces.

Some caterpillars, like early instars of the tomato hornworm and tobacco hornworm, have long &quot;whip-like&quot; organs attached to the ends of their body. The caterpillar wiggles these organs to frighten away flies and predatory wasps. Some caterpillars can evade predators by using a silk line and dropping off from branches when disturbed. Many species thrash about violently when disturbed to scare away potential predators. One species (&quot;Amorpha juglandis&quot;) even makes high pitched whistles that can scare away birds.

=== Social behaviors and relationships with other insects ===

Some caterpillars obtain protection by associating themselves with ants. The Lycaenid butterflies are particularly well known for this. They communicate with their ant protectors by vibrations as well as chemical means and typically provide food rewards.

Some caterpillars are gregarious; large aggregations are believed to help in reducing the levels of parasitization and predation. Clusters amplify the signal of aposematic coloration, and individuals may participate in group regurgitation or displays. Pine processionary (&quot;Thaumetopoea pityocampa&quot;) caterpillars often link into a long train to move through trees and over the ground. The head of the lead caterpillar is visible, but the other heads can appear hidden. Forest tent caterpillars cluster during periods of cold weather.

=== Predators ===

Caterpillars are eaten by many animals. The European pied flycatcher is one species that preys upon caterpillars. The flycatcher typically finds caterpillars among oak foliage. Paper wasps, including those in the genus&quot; Polistes&quot; and &quot;Polybia&quot; catch caterpillars to feed their young and themselves.

== Behavior ==
Caterpillars have been called &quot;eating machines&quot;, and eat leaves voraciously. Most species shed their skin four or five times as their bodies grow, and they eventually enter a pupal stage before becoming adults. Caterpillars grow very quickly; for instance, a tobacco hornworm will increase its weight ten-thousandfold in less than twenty days. An adaptation that enables them to eat so much is a mechanism in a specialized midgut that quickly transports ions to the lumen (midgut cavity), to keep the potassium level higher in the midgut cavity than in the hemolymph.

Most caterpillars are solely herbivorous. Many are restricted to feeding on one species of plant, while others are polyphagous. Some, including the clothes moth, feed on detritus. Some are predatory, and may prey on other species of caterpillars (e.g. Hawaiian &quot;Eupithecia&quot;). Others feed on eggs of other insects, aphids, scale insects, or ant larvae. A few are parasitic on cicadas or leaf hoppers (Epipyropidae). Some Hawaiian caterpillars (&quot;Hyposmocoma molluscivora&quot;) use silk traps to capture snails.

Many caterpillars are nocturnal. For example, the &quot;cutworms&quot; (of the family Noctuidae) hide at the base of plants during the day and only feed at night. Others, such as spongy moth (&quot;Lymantria dispar&quot;) larvae, change their activity patterns depending on density and larval stage, with more diurnal feeding in early instars and high densities.

== Economic effects ==

Caterpillars cause much damage, mainly by eating leaves. The propensity for damage is enhanced by monocultural farming practices, especially where the caterpillar is specifically adapted to the host plant under cultivation. The cotton bollworm causes enormous losses. Other species eat food crops. Caterpillars have been the target of pest control through the use of pesticides, biological control and agronomic practices. Many species have become resistant to pesticides. Bacterial toxins such as those from &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; which are evolved to affect the gut of Lepidoptera have been used in sprays of bacterial spores, toxin extracts and also by incorporating genes to produce them within the host plants. These approaches are defeated over time by the evolution of resistance mechanisms in the insects.

Plants evolve mechanisms of resistance to being eaten by caterpillars, including the evolution of chemical toxins and physical barriers such as hairs. Incorporating host plant resistance (HPR) through plant breeding is another approach used in reducing the impact of caterpillars on crop plants.

Some caterpillars are used in industry. The silk industry is based on the silkworm caterpillar.

== Human health ==
Caterpillar hair can be a cause of human health problems. Caterpillar hairs sometimes have venoms in them and species from approximately 12 families of moths or butterflies worldwide can inflict serious human injuries ranging from urticarial dermatitis and atopic asthma to osteochondritis, consumption coagulopathy, kidney failure, and brain bleeding. Skin rashes are the most common, but there have been fatalities. &quot;Lonomia&quot; is a frequent cause of envenomation in Brazil, with 354 cases reported between 1989 and 2005. Lethality ranging up to 20% with death caused most often by intracranial hemorrhage.

Caterpillar hair has also been known to cause kerato-conjunctivitis. The sharp barbs on the end of caterpillar hairs can get lodged in soft tissues and mucous membranes such as the eyes. Once they enter such tissues, they can be difficult to extract, often exacerbating the problem as they migrate across the membrane.

This becomes a particular problem in an indoor setting. The hair easily enter buildings through ventilation systems and accumulate in indoor environments because of their small size, which makes it difficult for them to be vented out. This accumulation increases the risk of human contact in indoor environments.

Caterpillars are a food source in some cultures. For example, in South Africa mopane worms are eaten by the bushmen, and in China silkworms are considered a delicacy.

== In popular culture ==

In the Old Testament of the Bible caterpillars are feared as pests that devour crops. They are part of the &quot;pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust&quot; because of their association with the locust, thus they are one of the plagues of Egypt. Jeremiah names them as one of the inhabitants of Babylon. The English word caterpillar derives from the old French &quot;catepelose&quot; (hairy cat) but merged with the &quot;piller&quot; (pillager). Caterpillars became a symbol for social dependents. Shakespeare&#x27;s Bolingbroke described King Richard&#x27;s friends as &quot;The caterpillars of the commonwealth, Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away&quot;. In 1790 William Blake referenced this popular image in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell when he attacked priests: &quot;as the caterpillar chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest lay his curse on the fairest joys&quot;.

The role of caterpillars in the life stages of butterflies was badly understood. In 1679 Maria Sibylla Merian published the first volume of &quot;The Caterpillars&#x27; Marvelous Transformation and Strange Floral Food&quot;, which contained 50 illustrations and a description of insects, moths, butterflies and their larvae. An earlier popular publication on moths and butterflies, and their caterpillars, by Jan Goedart had not included eggs in the life stages of European moths and butterflies, because he had believed that caterpillars were generated from water. When Merian published her study of caterpillars it was still widely believed that insects were spontaneously generated. Merian&#x27;s illustrations supported the findings of Francesco Redi, Marcello Malpighi and Jan Swammerdam.

Butterflies were regarded as symbol for the human soul since ancient time, and also in the Christian tradition. Goedart thus located his empirical observations on the transformation of caterpillars into butterflies in the Christian tradition. As such he argued that the metamorphosis from caterpillar into butterfly was a symbol, and even proof, of Christ&#x27;s resurrection. He argued &quot;that from dead caterpillars emerge living animals; so it is equally true and miraculous, that our dead and rotten corpses will rise from the grave.&quot; Swammerdam, who in 1669 had demonstrated that inside a caterpillar the rudiments of the future butterfly&#x27;s limbs and wings could be discerned, attacked the mystical and religious notion that the caterpillar died and the butterfly subsequently resurrected. As a militant Cartesian, Swammerdam attacked Goedart as ridiculous, and when publishing his findings he proclaimed &quot;here we witness the digression of those who have tried to prove Resurrection of the Dead from these obviously natural and comprehensible changes within the creature itself.&quot;

Since then the metamorphoses of the caterpillar into a butterfly has in Western societies been associated with countless human transformations in folktales and literature. There is no process in the physical life of human beings that resembles this metamorphoses, and the symbol of the caterpillar tends to depict a psychic transformation of a human. As such the caterpillar has in the Christian tradition become a metaphor for being &quot;born again&quot;.

Famously, in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland a caterpillar asks Alice &quot;Who are you?&quot;. When Alice comments on the caterpillar&#x27;s inevitable transformation into a butterfly, the caterpillar champions the position that in spite of changes it is still possible to know something, and that Alice is the same Alice at the beginning and end of a considerable interval. When the Caterpillar asks Alice to clarify a point, the child replies &quot;I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t put it more clearly... for I can&#x27;t but understand it myself, to begin with, and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing&quot;. Here Carroll satirizes René Descartes, the founder of Cartesian philosophy, and his theory on innate ideas. Descartes argued that we are distracted by urgent bodily stimuli that swamp the human mind in childhood. Descartes also theorised that inherited preconceived opinions obstruct the human perception of the truth.

More recent symbolic references to caterpillars in popular media include the &quot;Mad Men&quot; season 3 episode &quot;The Fog&quot;, in which Betty Draper has a drug-induced dream, while in labor, that she captures a caterpillar and holds it firmly in her hand. In &quot;The Sopranos&quot; season 5 episode &quot;The Test Dream&quot;, Tony Soprano dreams that Ralph Cifaretto has a caterpillar on his bald head that changes into a butterfly.

<doc id="48338" wikidata="Q11946202" url="?curid=48338" title="Butterfly">
<text>Butterflies are winged insects from the lepidopteran superfamily Papilionoidea, characterized by large, often brightly coloured wings that often fold together when at rest, and a conspicuous, fluttering flight. The oldest butterfly fossils have been dated to the Paleocene, about 56 million years ago, though molecular evidence suggests that they likely originated in the Cretaceous.

Butterflies have a four-stage life cycle, and like other holometabolous insects they undergo complete metamorphosis. Winged adults lay eggs on the food plant on which their larvae, known as caterpillars, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, expands its wings to dry, and flies off.

Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their entire life cycle.

Butterflies are often polymorphic, and many species make use of camouflage, mimicry, and aposematism to evade their predators. Some, like the monarch and the painted lady, migrate over long distances. Many butterflies are attacked by parasites or parasitoids, including wasps, protozoans, flies, and other invertebrates, or are preyed upon by other organisms. Some species are pests because in their larval stages they can damage domestic crops or trees; other species are agents of pollination of some plants. Larvae of a few butterflies (e.g., harvesters) eat harmful insects, and a few are predators of ants, while others live as mutualists in association with ants. Culturally, butterflies are a popular motif in the visual and literary arts. The Smithsonian Institution says &quot;butterflies are certainly one of the most appealing creatures in nature&quot;.

==Etymology==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; derives the word straightforwardly from Old English &quot;butorflēoge&quot;, butter-fly; similar names in Old Dutch and Old High German show that the name is ancient, but modern Dutch and German use different words ( and ) and the common name often varies substantially between otherwise closely related languages. A possible source of the name is the bright yellow male of the brimstone (&quot;Gonepteryx rhamni&quot;); another is that butterflies were on the wing in meadows during the spring and summer butter season while the grass was growing.

==Paleontology==
The earliest Lepidoptera fossils date to the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, around 200million years ago. Butterflies evolved from moths, so while the butterflies are monophyletic (forming a single clade), the moths are not. The oldest known butterfly is &quot;Protocoeliades kristenseni&quot; from the Palaeocene aged Fur Formation of Denmark, approximately 55million years old, which belongs to the family Hesperiidae (skippers). Molecular clock estimates suggest that butterflies originated sometime in the Late Cretaceous, but only significantly diversified during the Cenozoic, with one study suggesting a North American origin for the group. The oldest American butterfly is the Late Eocene &quot;Prodryas persephone&quot; from the Florissant Fossil Beds, approximately 34million years old.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==

Butterflies are divided into seven families that contain a total of about 20,000 species.

Traditionally, butterflies have been divided into the superfamilies Papilionoidea and the moth-like Hedyloidea. Recent work has discovered that Hedylidae, the only family within Hedyloidea, is nested within the Papilionoidea, meaning that Papilionoidea would be synonymous with Rhopalocera. The relationships between the rest of the 6 families are extremely well resolved, which is summarized in the below cladogram.

==Biology==
===General description===


Butterfly adults are characterized by their four scale-covered wings, which give the Lepidoptera their name (Ancient Greek λεπίς lepís, scale + πτερόν pterón, wing). These scales give butterfly wings their colour: they are pigmented with melanins that give them blacks and browns, as well as uric acid derivatives and flavones that give them yellows, but many of the blues, greens, reds and iridescent colours are created by structural coloration produced by the micro-structures of the scales and hairs.

As in all insects, the body is divided into three sections: the head, thorax, and abdomen. The thorax is composed of three segments, each with a pair of legs. In most families of butterfly the antennae are clubbed, unlike those of moths which may be threadlike or feathery. The long proboscis can be coiled when not in use for sipping nectar from flowers.

Nearly all butterflies are diurnal, have relatively bright colours, and hold their wings vertically above their bodies when at rest, unlike the majority of moths which fly by night, are often cryptically coloured (well camouflaged), and either hold their wings flat (touching the surface on which the moth is standing) or fold them closely over their bodies. Some day-flying moths, such as the hummingbird hawk-moth, are exceptions to these rules.

Butterfly larvae, caterpillars, have a hard (sclerotised) head with strong mandibles used for cutting their food, most often leaves. They have cylindrical bodies, with ten segments to the abdomen, generally with short prolegs on segments 3–6 and 10; the three pairs of true legs on the thorax have five segments each. Many are well camouflaged; others are aposematic with bright colours and bristly projections containing toxic chemicals obtained from their food plants. The pupa or chrysalis, unlike that of moths, is not wrapped in a cocoon.
Many butterflies are sexually dimorphic. Most butterflies have the ZW sex-determination system where females are the heterogametic sex (ZW) and males homogametic (ZZ).

===Distribution and migration===

Butterflies are distributed worldwide except Antarctica, totalling some 18,500 species. Of these, 775 are Nearctic; 7,700 Neotropical; 1,575 Palearctic; 3,650 Afrotropical; and 4,800 are distributed across the combined Oriental and Australian/Oceania regions. The monarch butterfly is native to the Americas, but in the nineteenth century or before, spread across the world, and is now found in Australia, New Zealand, other parts of Oceania, and the Iberian Peninsula. It is not clear how it dispersed; adults may have been blown by the wind or larvae or pupae may have been accidentally transported by humans, but the presence of suitable host plants in their new environment was a necessity for their successful establishment.

Many butterflies, such as the painted lady, monarch, and several danaine migrate for long distances. These migrations take place over a number of generations and no single individual completes the whole trip. The eastern North American population of monarchs can travel thousands of miles south-west to overwintering sites in Mexico. There is a reverse migration in the spring. It has recently been shown that the British painted lady undertakes a 9,000-mile round trip in a series of steps by up to six successive generations, from tropical Africa to the Arctic Circle — almost double the length of the famous migrations undertaken by monarch. Spectacular large-scale migrations associated with the monsoon are seen in peninsular India. Migrations have been studied in more recent times using wing tags and also using stable hydrogen isotopes.

Butterflies navigate using a time-compensated sun compass. They can see polarized light and therefore orient even in cloudy conditions. The polarized light near the ultraviolet spectrum appears to be particularly important. Many migratory butterflies live in semi-arid areas where breeding seasons are short. The life histories of their host plants also influence butterfly behaviour.

===Life cycle===

Butterflies in their adult stage can live from a week to nearly a year depending on the species. Many species have long larval life stages while others can remain dormant in their pupal or egg stages and thereby survive winters. The Melissa Arctic (&quot;Oeneis melissa&quot;) overwinters twice as a caterpillar. Butterflies may have one or more broods per year. The number of generations per year varies from temperate to tropical regions with tropical regions showing a trend towards multivoltinism.


Courtship is often aerial and often involves pheromones. Butterflies then land on the ground or on a perch to mate. Copulation takes place tail-to-tail and may last from minutes to hours. Simple photoreceptor cells located at the genitals are important for this and other adult behaviours. The male passes a spermatophore to the female; to reduce sperm competition, he may cover her with his scent, or in some species such as the Apollos (&quot;Parnassius&quot;) plugs her genital opening to prevent her from mating again.

The vast majority of butterflies have a four-stage life cycle: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis) and imago (adult). In the genera &quot;Colias&quot;, &quot;Erebia&quot;, &quot;Euchloe&quot;, and &quot;Parnassius&quot;, a small number of species are known that reproduce semi-parthenogenetically; when the female dies, a partially developed larva emerges from her abdomen.

====Eggs====

Butterfly eggs are protected by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the &quot;chorion&quot;. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called &quot;micropyles&quot;; the purpose of these holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.

Butterfly eggs are fixed to a leaf with a special glue which hardens rapidly. As it hardens it contracts, deforming the shape of the egg. This glue is easily seen surrounding the base of every egg forming a meniscus. The nature of the glue has been little researched but in the case of &quot;Pieris brassicae&quot;, it begins as a pale yellow granular secretion containing acidophilic proteins. This is viscous and darkens when exposed to air, becoming a water-insoluble, rubbery material which soon sets solid. Butterflies in the genus &quot;Agathymus&quot; do not fix their eggs to a leaf; instead, the newly laid eggs fall to the base of the plant.

Eggs are almost invariably laid on plants. Each species of butterfly has its own host plant range and while some species of butterfly are restricted to just one species of plant, others use a range of plant species, often including members of a common family. In some species, such as the great spangled fritillary, the eggs are deposited close to but not on the food plant. This most likely happens when the egg overwinters before hatching and where the host plant loses its leaves in winter, as do violets in this example.

The egg stage lasts a few weeks in most butterflies, but eggs laid close to winter, especially in temperate regions, go through a diapause (resting) stage, and the hatching may take place only in spring. Some temperate region butterflies, such as the Camberwell beauty, lay their eggs in the spring and have them hatch in the summer.

====Caterpillar larva====
Butterfly larvae, or caterpillars, consume plant leaves and spend practically all of their time searching for and eating food. Although most caterpillars are herbivorous, a few species are predators: &quot;Spalgis epius&quot; eats scale insects, while lycaenids such as &quot;Liphyra brassolis&quot; are myrmecophilous, eating ant larvae.

Some larvae, especially those of the Lycaenidae, form mutual associations with ants. They communicate with the ants using vibrations that are transmitted through the substrate as well as using chemical signals. The ants provide some degree of protection to these larvae and they in turn gather honeydew secretions. Large blue (&quot;Phengaris arion&quot;) caterpillars trick &quot;Myrmica&quot; ants into taking them back to the ant colony where they feed on the ant eggs and larvae in a parasitic relationship.

Caterpillars mature through a series of developmental stages known as instars. Near the end of each stage, the larva undergoes a process called apolysis, mediated by the release of a series of neurohormones. During this phase, the cuticle, a tough outer layer made of a mixture of chitin and specialized proteins, is released from the softer epidermis beneath, and the epidermis begins to form a new cuticle. At the end of each instar, the larva moults, the old cuticle splits and the new cuticle expands, rapidly hardening and developing pigment. 

Caterpillars have short antennae and several simple eyes. The mouthparts are adapted for chewing with powerful mandibles and a pair of maxillae, each with a segmented palp. Adjoining these is the labium-hypopharynx which houses a tubular spinneret which is able to extrude silk. Caterpillars such as those in the genus &quot;Calpodes&quot; (family Hesperiidae) have a specialized tracheal system on the 8th segment that function as a primitive lung. Butterfly caterpillars have three pairs of true legs on the thoracic segments and up to six pairs of prolegs arising from the abdominal segments. These prolegs have rings of tiny hooks called crochets that are engaged hydrostatically and help the caterpillar grip the substrate. The epidermis bears tufts of setae, the position and number of which help in identifying the species. There is also decoration in the form of hairs, wart-like protuberances, horn-like protuberances and spines. Internally, most of the body cavity is taken up by the gut, but there may also be large silk glands, and special glands which secrete distasteful or toxic substances. The developing wings are present in later stage instars and the gonads start development in the egg stage.

====Pupa====
When the larva is fully grown, hormones such as prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) are produced. At this point the larva stops feeding, and begins &quot;wandering&quot; in the quest for a suitable pupation site, often the underside of a leaf or other concealed location. There it spins a button of silk which it uses to fasten its body to the surface and moults for a final time. While some caterpillars spin a cocoon to protect the pupa, most species do not. The naked pupa, often known as a chrysalis, usually hangs head down from the cremaster, a spiny pad at the posterior end, but in some species a silken girdle may be spun to keep the pupa in a head-up position. Most of the tissues and cells of the larva are broken down inside the pupa, as the constituent material is rebuilt into the imago. The structure of the transforming insect is visible from the exterior, with the wings folded flat on the ventral surface and the two halves of the proboscis, with the antennae and the legs between them.

The pupal transformation into a butterfly through metamorphosis has held great appeal to mankind. To transform from the miniature wings visible on the outside of the pupa into large structures usable for flight, the pupal wings undergo rapid mitosis and absorb a great deal of nutrients. If one wing is surgically removed early on, the other three will grow to a larger size. In the pupa, the wing forms a structure that becomes compressed from top to bottom and pleated from proximal to distal ends as it grows, so that it can rapidly be unfolded to its full adult size. Several boundaries seen in the adult colour pattern are marked by changes in the expression of particular transcription factors in the early pupa.

====Adult====
The reproductive stage of the insect is the winged adult or imago. The surface of both butterflies and moths is covered by scales, each of which is an outgrowth from a single epidermal cell. The head is small and dominated by the two large compound eyes. These are capable of distinguishing flower shapes or motion but cannot view distant objects clearly. Colour perception is good, especially in some species in the blue/violet range. The antennae are composed of many segments and have clubbed tips (unlike moths that have tapering or feathery antennae). The sensory receptors are concentrated in the tips and can detect odours. Taste receptors are located on the palps and on the feet. The mouthparts are adapted to sucking and the mandibles are usually reduced in size or absent. The first maxillae are elongated into a tubular proboscis which is curled up at rest and expanded when needed to feed. The first and second maxillae bear palps which function as sensory organs. Some species have a reduced proboscis or maxillary palps and do not feed as adults.

Many &quot;Heliconius&quot; butterflies also use their proboscis to feed on pollen; in these species only 20% of the amino acids used in reproduction come from larval feeding, which allow them to develop more quickly as caterpillars, and gives them a longer lifespan of several months as adults.

The thorax of the butterfly is devoted to locomotion. Each of the three thoracic segments has two legs (among nymphalids, the first pair is reduced and the insects walk on four legs). The second and third segments of the thorax bear the wings. The leading edges of the forewings have thick veins to strengthen them, and the hindwings are smaller and more rounded and have fewer stiffening veins. The forewings and hindwings are not hooked together (as they are in moths) but are coordinated by the friction of their overlapping parts. The front two segments have a pair of spiracles which are used in respiration.

The abdomen consists of ten segments and contains the gut and genital organs. The front eight segments have spiracles and the terminal segment is modified for reproduction. The male has a pair of clasping organs attached to a ring structure, and during copulation, a tubular structure is extruded and inserted into the female&#x27;s vagina. A spermatophore is deposited in the female, following which the sperm make their way to a seminal receptacle where they are stored for later use. In both sexes, the genitalia are adorned with various spines, teeth, scales and bristles, which act to prevent the butterfly from mating with an insect of another species. After it emerges from its pupal stage, a butterfly cannot fly until the wings are unfolded. A newly emerged butterfly needs to spend some time inflating its wings with hemolymph and letting them dry, during which time it is extremely vulnerable to predators.

==== Pattern formation ====
The colourful patterns on many butterfly wings tell potential predators that they are toxic. Hence, the genetic basis of wing pattern formation can illuminate both the evolution of butterflies as well as their developmental biology. The colour of butterfly wings is derived from tiny structures called scales, each of which have their own pigments. In &quot;Heliconius&quot; butterflies, there are three types of scales: yellow/white, black, and red/orange/brown scales. Some mechanism of wing pattern formation are now being solved using genetic techniques. For instance, a gene called &quot;cortex&quot; determines the colour of scales: deleting &quot;cortex&quot; turned black and red scales yellow. Mutations, e.g. transposon insertions of the non-coding DNA around the &quot;cortex&quot; gene can turn a black-winged butterfly into a butterfly with a yellow wing band.

===Mating===
When the butterfly &quot;Bicyclus anynana&quot; is subjected to repeated inbreeding in the laboratory, there is a dramatic decrease in egg hatching. This severe inbreeding depression is considered to be likely due to a relatively high mutation rate to recessive alleles with substantial damaging effects and infrequent episodes of inbreeding in nature that might otherwise purge such mutations. Although &quot;B. anynana&quot; experiences inbreeding depression when forcibly inbred in the laboratory it recovers within a few generation when allowed to breed freely. During mate selection, adult females do not innately avoid or learn to avoid siblings, implying that such detection may not be critical to reproductive fitness. Inbreeding may persist in &quot;B anynana&quot; because the probability of encountering close relatives is rare in nature; that is, movement ecology may mask the deleterious effect of inbreeding resulting in relaxation of selection for active inbreeding avoidance behaviors.

===Behaviour===
Butterflies feed primarily on nectar from flowers. Some also derive nourishment from pollen, tree sap, rotting fruit, dung, decaying flesh, and dissolved minerals in wet sand or dirt. Butterflies are important as pollinators for some species of plants. In general, they do not carry as much pollen load as bees, but they are capable of moving pollen over greater distances. Flower constancy has been observed for at least one species of butterfly.

Adult butterflies consume only liquids, ingested through the proboscis. They sip water from damp patches for hydration and feed on nectar from flowers, from which they obtain sugars for energy, and sodium and other minerals vital for reproduction. Several species of butterflies need more sodium than that provided by nectar and are attracted by sodium in salt; they sometimes land on people, attracted by the salt in human sweat. Some butterflies also visit dung and scavenge rotting fruit or carcasses to obtain minerals and nutrients. In many species, this mud-puddling behaviour is restricted to the males, and studies have suggested that the nutrients collected may be provided as a nuptial gift, along with the spermatophore, during mating.

In hilltopping, males of some species seek hilltops and ridge tops, which they patrol in search for females. Since it usually occurs in species with low population density, it is assumed these landscape points are used as meeting places to find mates.

Butterflies use their antennae to sense the air for wind and scents. The antennae come in various shapes and colours; the hesperiids have a pointed angle or hook to the antennae, while most other families show knobbed antennae. The antennae are richly covered with sensory organs known as sensillae. A butterfly&#x27;s sense of taste is coordinated by chemoreceptors on the tarsi, or feet, which work only on contact, and are used to determine whether an egg-laying insect&#x27;s offspring will be able to feed on a leaf before eggs are laid on it. Many butterflies use chemical signals, pheromones; some have specialized scent scales (androconia) or other structures (coremata or &quot;hair pencils&quot; in the Danaidae). Vision is well developed in butterflies and most species are sensitive to the ultraviolet spectrum. Many species show sexual dimorphism in the patterns of UV reflective patches. Colour vision may be widespread but has been demonstrated in only a few species. Some butterflies have organs of hearing and some species make stridulatory and clicking sounds.

Many species of butterfly maintain territories and actively chase other species or individuals that may stray into them. Some species will bask or perch on chosen perches. The flight styles of butterflies are often characteristic and some species have courtship flight displays. Butterflies can only fly when their temperature is above ; when it is cool, they can position themselves to expose the underside of the wings to the sunlight to heat themselves up. If their body temperature reaches , they can orientate themselves with the folded wings edgewise to the sun. Basking is an activity which is more common in the cooler hours of the morning. Some species have evolved dark wingbases to help in gathering more heat and this is especially evident in alpine forms.

As in many other insects, the lift generated by butterflies is more than can be accounted for by steady-state, non-transitory aerodynamics. Studies using &quot;Vanessa atalanta&quot; in a wind tunnel show that they use a wide variety of aerodynamic mechanisms to generate force. These include wake capture, vortices at the wing edge, rotational mechanisms and the Weis-Fogh &#x27;clap-and-fling&#x27; mechanism. Butterflies are able to change from one mode to another rapidly.

===Ecology===
====Parasitoids, predators, and pathogens====
Butterflies are threatened in their early stages by parasitoids and in all stages by predators, diseases and environmental factors. Braconid and other parasitic wasps lay their eggs in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the wasps&#x27; parasitoid larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their host species and some have been used as biological controls of pest butterflies like the large white butterfly. When the small cabbage white was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies. In order to control it, some pupae that had been parasitised by a chalcid wasp were imported, and natural control was thus regained. Some flies lay their eggs on the outside of caterpillars and the newly hatched fly larvae bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the parasitoid wasp larvae. Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.

Caterpillars are also affected by a range of bacterial, viral and fungal diseases, and only a small percentage of the butterfly eggs laid ever reach adulthood. The bacterium &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; has been used in sprays to reduce damage to crops by the caterpillars of the large white butterfly, and the entomopathogenic fungus &quot;Beauveria bassiana&quot; has proved effective for the same purpose.

====Endangered species====
Queen Alexandra&#x27;s birdwing, found in Papua New Guinea, is the largest butterfly in the world. The species is endangered, and is one of only three insects (the other two being butterflies as well) to be listed on Appendix I of CITES, making international trade illegal.

====Defences====
Butterflies protect themselves from predators by a variety of means.

Chemical defences are widespread and are mostly based on chemicals of plant origin. In many cases the plants themselves evolved these toxic substances as protection against herbivores. Butterflies have evolved mechanisms to sequester these plant toxins and use them instead in their own defence. These defence mechanisms are effective only if they are well advertised; this has led to the evolution of bright colours in unpalatable butterflies (aposematism). This signal is commonly mimicked by other butterflies, usually only females. A Batesian mimic imitates another species to enjoy the protection of that species&#x27; aposematism. The common Mormon of India has female morphs which imitate the unpalatable red-bodied swallowtails, the common rose and the crimson rose. Müllerian mimicry occurs when aposematic species evolve to resemble each other, presumably to reduce predator sampling rates; &quot;Heliconius&quot; butterflies from the Americas are a good example.

Camouflage is found in many butterflies. Some like the oakleaf butterfly and autumn leaf are remarkable imitations of leaves. As caterpillars, many defend themselves by freezing and appearing like sticks or branches. Others have deimatic behaviours, such as rearing up and waving their front ends which are marked with eyespots as if they were snakes. Some papilionid caterpillars such as the giant swallowtail (&quot;Papilio cresphontes&quot;) resemble bird droppings so as to be passed over by predators. Some caterpillars have hairs and bristly structures that provide protection while others are gregarious and form dense aggregations. Some species are myrmecophiles, forming mutualistic associations with ants and gaining their protection. Behavioural defences include perching and angling the wings to reduce shadow and avoid being conspicuous. Some female Nymphalid butterflies guard their eggs from parasitoidal wasps.

The Lycaenidae have a false head consisting of eyespots and small tails (false antennae) to deflect attack from the more vital head region. These may also cause ambush predators such as spiders to approach from the wrong end, enabling the butterflies to detect attacks promptly. Many butterflies have eyespots on the wings; these too may deflect attacks, or may serve to attract mates.

Auditory defences can also be used, which in the case of the grizzled skipper refers to vibrations generated by the butterfly upon expanding its wings in an attempt to communicate with ant predators.

Many tropical butterflies have seasonal forms for dry and wet seasons. These are switched by the hormone ecdysone. The dry-season forms are usually more cryptic, perhaps offering better camouflage when vegetation is scarce. Dark colours in wet-season forms may help to absorb solar radiation.

Butterflies without defences such as toxins or mimicry protect themselves through a flight that is more bumpy and unpredictable than in other species. It is assumed this behavior makes it more difficult for predators to catch them, and is caused by the turbulence created by the small whirlpools formed by the wings during flight.

==Declining numbers==

Declining butterfly populations have been noticed in many areas of the world, and this phenomenon is consistent with the rapidly decreasing insect populations around the world. At least in the Western United States, this collapse in the number of most species of butterflies has been determined to be driven by global climate change, specifically, by warmer autumns.

==In culture==
=== In art and literature ===

Butterflies have appeared in art from 3500 years ago in ancient Egypt. In hunting scenes, butterflies were sometimes included in a way that suggested life, freedom, and the strength to escape capture, creating a balance to scenes concerned with death and upholding ma&#x27;at. They also were suggestive of regeneration or rebirth and protection. Certain butterflies, such as the tiger butterfly, may have been associated with solar deities, particularly Ra. The tiger butterfly also would have a particular resemblance to the ankh, due to its black body and wingtips, that was likely noted by the Ancient Egyptians. Butterflies may also have been understood as one of the deceased&#x27;s guides in the afterlife.

In the ancient Mesoamerican city of Teotihuacan, the brilliantly coloured image of the butterfly was carved into many temples, buildings, jewellery, and emblazoned on incense burners. The butterfly was sometimes depicted with the maw of a jaguar, and some species were considered to be the reincarnations of the souls of dead warriors. The close association of butterflies with fire and warfare persisted into the Aztec civilisation; evidence of similar jaguar-butterfly images has been found among the Zapotec and Maya civilisations.

Butterflies are widely used in objects of art and jewellery: mounted in frames, embedded in resin, displayed in bottles, laminated in paper, and used in some mixed media artworks and furnishings. The Norwegian naturalist Kjell Sandved compiled a photographic &quot;Butterfly Alphabet&quot; containing all 26 letters and the numerals 0 to 9 from the wings of butterflies. The butterfly is a symbol of being transgender, because of the transformation from caterpillar to winged adult.

Sir John Tenniel drew a famous illustration of Alice meeting a caterpillar for Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, c. 1865. The caterpillar is seated on a toadstool and is smoking a hookah; the image can be read as showing either the forelegs of the larva, or as suggesting a face with protruding nose and chin. Eric Carle&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;The Very Hungry Caterpillar&quot; portrays the larva as an extraordinarily hungry animal, while also teaching children how to count (to five) and the days of the week. A butterfly appeared in one of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Just So Stories&quot;, &quot;The Butterfly that Stamped&quot;.

One of the most popular, and most often recorded, songs by Sweden&#x27;s eighteenth-century bard, Carl Michael Bellman, is &quot;Fjäriln vingad syns på Haga&quot; (The butterfly wingèd&#x27;s seen in Haga), one of his &quot;Fredman&#x27;s Songs&quot;. &quot;Madam Butterfly&quot; is a 1904 opera by Giacomo Puccini about a romantic young Japanese bride who is deserted by her American officer husband soon after they are married. It was based on an 1898 short story by John Luther Long.

===In mythology and folklore===
According to Lafcadio Hearn, a butterfly was seen in Japan as the personification of a person&#x27;s soul; whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if a butterfly enters your guest room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens. When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing his famous revolt, a vast a swarm of butterflies appeared in Kyoto. The people were frightened, thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.

Diderot&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; cites butterflies as a symbol for the soul. A Roman sculpture depicts a butterfly exiting the mouth of a dead man, representing the Roman belief that the soul leaves through the mouth. In line with this, the ancient Greek word for &quot;butterfly&quot; is ψυχή (&quot;psȳchē&quot;), which primarily means &quot;soul&quot; or &quot;mind&quot;. According to Mircea Eliade, some of the Nagas of Manipur claim ancestry from a butterfly. In some cultures, butterflies symbolise rebirth. In the English county of Devon, people once hurried to kill the first butterfly of the year, to avoid a year of bad luck. In the Philippines, a lingering black or dark butterfly or moth in the house is taken to mean an impending or recent death in the family. Several American states have chosen an official state butterfly.

===Collecting, recording, and rearing===

&quot;Collecting&quot; means preserving dead specimens, not keeping butterflies as pets. Collecting butterflies was once a popular hobby; it has now largely been replaced by photography, recording, and rearing butterflies for release into the wild. The zoological illustrator Frederick William Frohawk succeeded in rearing all the butterfly species found in Britain, at a rate of four per year, to enable him to draw every stage of each species. He published the results in the folio sized handbook &quot;The Natural History of British Butterflies&quot; in 1924.

Butterflies and moths can be reared for recreation or for release.

===In technology===
Study of the structural coloration of the wing scales of swallowtail butterflies has led to the development of more efficient light-emitting diodes, and is inspiring nanotechnology research to produce paints that do not use toxic pigments and the development of new display technologies.

<text>A parachute is a device used to slow the motion of an object through an atmosphere by creating drag or aerodynamic lift. A major application is to support people, for recreation or as a safety device for aviators, who can exit from an aircraft at height and descend safely to earth.

A parachute is usually made of a light, strong fabric. Early parachutes were made of silk. The most common fabric today is nylon. A parachute&#x27;s canopy is typically dome-shaped, but some are rectangles, inverted domes, and other shapes.

A variety of loads are attached to parachutes, including people, food, equipment, space capsules, and bombs.

== History ==
=== Middle Ages ===
In 852, in Córdoba, Spain, the Andalusian Armen Firman attempted unsuccessfully to fly by jumping from a tower while wearing a large cloak. It was recorded that &quot;there was enough air in the folds of his cloak to prevent great injury when he reached the ground.&quot;

=== Early Renaissance ===
The earliest evidence for the true parachute dates back to the Renaissance period. The oldest parachute design appears in a manuscript from the 1470s attributed to Francesco di Giorgio Martini (British Library, Add MS 34113, fol. 200v), showing a free-hanging man clutching a crossbar frame attached to a conical canopy. As a safety measure, four straps ran from the ends of the rods to a waist belt. Although the surface area of the parachute design appears to be too small to offer effective air resistance and the wooden base-frame is superfluous and potentially harmful, the basic concept of a working parachute is apparent.

The design is a marked improvement over another folio (189v), which depicts a man trying to break the force of his fall using two long cloth streamers fastened to two bars, which he grips with his hands.

Shortly after, a more sophisticated parachute was sketched by the polymath Leonardo da Vinci in his &quot;Codex Atlanticus&quot; (fol. 381v) dated to . Here, the scale of the parachute is in a more favorable proportion to the weight of the jumper. A square wooden frame, which alters the shape of the parachute from conical to pyramidal, held open Leonardo&#x27;s canopy. It is not known whether the Italian inventor was influenced by the earlier design, but he may have learned about the idea through the intensive oral communication among artist-engineers of the time. The feasibility of Leonardo&#x27;s pyramidal design was successfully tested in 2000 by Briton Adrian Nicholas and again in 2008 by the Swiss skydiver Olivier Vietti-Teppa. According to historian of technology Lynn White, these conical and pyramidal designs, much more elaborate than early artistic jumps with rigid parasols in Asia, mark the origin of &quot;the parachute as we know it.&quot;
The Croatian polymath and inventor Fausto Veranzio, or Faust Vrančić (1551–1617), examined da Vinci&#x27;s parachute sketch and kept the square frame but replaced the canopy with a bulging sail-like piece of cloth that he came to realize decelerates a fall more effectively. A now-famous depiction of a parachute that he dubbed &quot;Homo Volans&quot; (Flying Man), showing a man parachuting from a tower, presumably St Mark&#x27;s Campanile in Venice, appeared in his book on mechanics, &quot;Machinae Novae&quot; (&quot;New Machines&quot;, published in 1615 or 1616), alongside a number of other devices and technical concepts.

It was once widely believed that in 1617, Veranzio, then aged 65 and seriously ill, implemented his design and tested the parachute by jumping from St Mark&#x27;s Campanile, from a bridge nearby, or from St Martin&#x27;s Cathedral in Bratislava. Various publications incorrectly claimed the event was documented some thirty years later by John Wilkins, one of the founders of, and secretary of, the Royal Society in London, in his book &quot;Mathematical Magick or, the Wonders that may be Performed by Mechanical Geometry&quot;, published in London in 1648. However, Wilkins wrote about flying, not parachutes, and does not mention Veranzio, a parachute jump, or any event in 1617. Doubts about this test, which include a lack of written evidence, suggest it never occurred, and was instead a misreading of historical notes.

===18th and 19th centuries===


The modern parachute was invented in the late 18th century by Louis-Sébastien Lenormand in France, who made the first recorded public jump in 1783. Lenormand also sketched his device beforehand.

Two years later, in 1785, Lenormand coined the word &quot;parachute&quot; by hybridizing an Italian prefix &quot;para&quot;, an imperative form of &quot;parare&quot; = to avert, defend, resist, guard, shield or shroud, from &quot;paro&quot; = to parry, and &quot;chute&quot;, the French word for &quot;fall&quot;, to describe the aeronautical device&#x27;s real function.

Also in 1785, Jean-Pierre Blanchard demonstrated it as a means of safely disembarking from a hot-air balloon. While Blanchard&#x27;s first parachute demonstrations were conducted with a dog as the passenger, he later claimed to have had the opportunity to try it himself in 1793 when his hot air balloon ruptured, and he used a parachute to descend. (This event was not witnessed by others.)

On 12 October 1799, Jeanne Geneviève Garnerin ascended in a gondola attached to a balloon. At 900 meters she detached the gondola from the balloon and descended in the gondola by parachute. In doing so, she became the first woman to parachute. She went on to complete many ascents and parachute descents in towns across France and Europe.

Subsequent development of the parachute focused on it becoming more compact. While the early parachutes were made of linen stretched over a wooden frame, in the late 1790s, Blanchard began making parachutes from folded silk, taking advantage of silk&#x27;s strength and light weight. In 1797, André Garnerin made the first descent of a &quot;frameless&quot; parachute covered in silk. In 1804, Jérôme Lalande introduced a vent in the canopy to eliminate violent oscillations. In 1887, Park Van Tassel and Thomas Scott Baldwin invented a parachute in San Francisco, California, with Baldwin making the first successful parachute jump in the western United States.

===Eve of World War I===
In 1907 Charles Broadwick demonstrated two key advances in the parachute he used to jump from hot air balloons at fairs: he folded his parachute into a backpack, and the parachute was pulled from the pack by a static line attached to the balloon. When Broadwick jumped from the balloon, the static line became taut, pulled the parachute from the pack, and then snapped.

In 1911 a successful test took place with a dummy at the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The puppet&#x27;s weight was ; the parachute&#x27;s weight was . The cables between the puppet and the parachute were long. On February 4, 1912, Franz Reichelt jumped to his death from the tower during initial testing of his wearable parachute.

Also in 1911, Grant Morton made the first parachute jump from an airplane, a Wright Model B piloted by Phil Parmalee, at Venice Beach, California. Morton&#x27;s device was of the &quot;throw-out&quot; type where he held the parachute in his arms as he left the aircraft. In the same year (1911), Russian Gleb Kotelnikov invented the first knapsack parachute, although Hermann Lattemann and his wife Käthe Paulus had been jumping with bagged parachutes in the last decade of the 19th century.

In 1912, on a road near Tsarskoye Selo, years before it became part of St. Petersburg, Kotelnikov successfully demonstrated the braking effects of a parachute by accelerating a Russo-Balt automobile to its top speed and then opening a parachute attached to the back seat, thus also inventing the drogue parachute.

On 1 March 1912, U.S. Army Captain Albert Berry made the first (attached-type) parachute jump in the United States from a fixed-wing aircraft, a Benoist pusher, while flying above Jefferson Barracks, St. Louis, Missouri. The jump utilized a parachute stored or housed in a cone-shaped casing under the airplane and attached to a harness on the jumper&#x27;s body.

Štefan Banič patented an umbrella-like design in 1914, and sold (or donated) the patent to the United States military, which later modified his design, resulting in the first military parachute. Banič had been the first person to patent the parachute, and his design was the first to properly function in the 20th century.

On June 21, 1913, Georgia Broadwick became the first woman to parachute-jump from a moving aircraft, doing so over Los Angeles, California. In 1914, while doing demonstrations for the U.S. Army, Broadwick deployed her chute manually, thus becoming the first person to jump free-fall.

===World War I===

The first military use of the parachute was by artillery observers on tethered observation balloons in World War I. These were tempting targets for enemy fighter aircraft, though difficult to destroy, due to their heavy anti-aircraft defenses. Because it was difficult to escape from them, and dangerous when on fire due to their hydrogen inflation, observers would abandon them and descend by parachute as soon as enemy aircraft were seen. The ground crew would then attempt to retrieve and deflate the balloon as quickly as possible. The main part of the parachute was in a bag suspended from the balloon with the pilot wearing only a simple waist harness attached to the main parachute. When the balloon crew jumped the main part of the parachute was pulled from the bag by the crew&#x27;s waist harness, first the shroud lines, followed by the main canopy. This type of parachute was first adopted on a large scale for their observation balloon crews by the Germans, and then later by the British and French. While this type of unit worked well from balloons, it had mixed results when used on fixed-wing aircraft by the Germans, where the bag was stored in a compartment directly behind the pilot. In many instances where it did not work the shroud lines became entangled with the spinning aircraft. Although this type of parachute saved a number of famous German fighter pilots, including Hermann Göring, no parachutes were issued to the crews of Allied &quot;heavier-than-air&quot; aircraft. It has been claimed that the reason was to avoid pilots jumping from the plane when hit rather than trying to save the aircraft, but Air Vice Marshall Arthur Gould Lee, himself a pilot during the war, examined the British War Office files after the war and found no evidence of such claim.
Airplane cockpits at that time also were not large enough to accommodate a pilot and a parachute, since a seat that would fit a pilot wearing a parachute would be too large for a pilot not wearing one. This is why the German type was stowed in the fuselage, rather than being of the &quot;backpack&quot; type. Weight was – at the very beginning – also a consideration since planes had limited load capacity. Carrying a parachute impeded performance and reduced the useful offensive and fuel load.

In the UK, Everard Calthrop, a railway engineer and breeder of Arab horses, invented and marketed through his Aerial Patents Company a &quot;British Parachute&quot; and the &quot;Guardian Angel&quot; parachute. As part of an investigation into Calthrop&#x27;s design, on 13 January 1917, test pilot Clive Franklyn Collett successfully jumped from a Royal Aircraft Factory BE.2c flying over Orford Ness Experimental Station at . He repeated the experiment several days later.

Following on from Collett, balloon officer Thomas Orde-Lees, known as the &quot;Mad Major&quot;, successfully jumped from Tower Bridge in London, which led to the balloonists of the Royal Flying Corps using parachutes, though they were issued for use in aircraft.

In 1911, Solomon Lee Van Meter, Jr. of Lexington, Kentucky, submitted an application for, and in July 1916 received, a patent for a backpack style parachute – the Aviatory Life Buoy. His self-contained device featured a revolutionary quick-release mechanism – the ripcord – that allowed a falling aviator to expand the canopy only when safely away from the disabled aircraft.

Otto Heinecke, a German airship ground crewman, designed a parachute which the German air service introduced in 1918, becoming the world&#x27;s first air service to introduce a standard parachute. Schroeder company of Berlin manufactured Heinecke&#x27;s design. The first successful use of this parachute was by Leutnant Helmut Steinbrecher of Jagdstaffel 46, who bailed on 27 June 1918 from his stricken fighter airplane to become the first pilot in history to successfully do so. Although many pilots were saved by the Heinecke design, their efficacy was relatively poor. Out of the first 70 German airmen to bail out, around a third died, These fatalities were mostly due to the chute or ripcord becoming entangled in the airframe of their spinning aircraft or because of harness failure, a problem fixed in later versions.

The French, British, American and Italian air services later based their first parachute designs on the Heinecke parachute to varying extents.

In the UK, Sir Frank Mears, who was serving as a Major in the Royal Flying Corps in France (Kite Balloon section), registered a patent in July 1918 for a parachute with a quick release buckle, known as the &quot;Mears parachute&quot;, which was in common use from then onwards.

===Post-World War I===

The experience with parachutes during the war highlighted the need to develop a design that could be reliably used to exit a disabled airplane. For instance, tethered parachutes did not work well when the aircraft was spinning. After the war, Major Edward L. Hoffman of the United States Army led an effort to develop an improved parachute by bringing together the best elements of multiple parachute designs. Participants in the effort included Leslie Irvin and James Floyd Smith. The team eventually created the Airplane Parachute Type-A. This incorporated three key elements:
* storing the parachute in a soft pack worn on the back, as demonstrated by Charles Broadwick in 1906;
* a ripcord for manually deploying the parachute at a safe distance from the airplane, from a design by Albert Leo Stevens; and 
* a pilot chute that draws the main canopy from the pack.

In 1919, Irvin successfully tested the parachute by jumping from an airplane. The Type-A parachute was put into production and over time saved a number of lives. The effort was recognized by the awarding of the Robert J. Collier Trophy to Major Edward L. Hoffman in 1926.

Irvin became the first person to make a premeditated free-fall parachute jump from an airplane. An early brochure of the Irvin Air Chute Company credits William O&#x27;Connor as having become, on 24 August 1920, at McCook Field near Dayton, Ohio, the first person to be saved by an Irvin parachute. Test pilot Lt. Harold R. Harris made another life-saving jump at McCook Field on 20 October 1922. Shortly after Harris&#x27; jump, two Dayton newspaper reporters suggested the creation of the Caterpillar Club for successful parachute jumps from disabled aircraft.

Beginning with Italy in 1927, several countries experimented with using parachutes to drop soldiers behind enemy lines. The regular Soviet Airborne Troops were established as early as 1931 after a number of experimental military mass jumps starting from 2 August 1930. Earlier the same year, the first Soviet mass jumps led to the development of the parachuting sport in the Soviet Union. By the time of World War II, large airborne forces were trained and used in surprise attacks, as in the battles for Fort Eben-Emael and The Hague, the first large-scale, opposed landings of paratroopers in military history, by the Germans. This was followed later in the war by airborne assaults on a larger scale, such as the Battle of Crete and Operation Market Garden, the latter being the largest airborne military operation ever. Aircraft crew were routinely equipped with parachutes for emergencies as well.

In 1937, drag chutes were used in aviation for the first time, by Soviet airplanes in the Arctic that were providing support for the polar expeditions of the era, such as the first drifting ice station, North Pole-1. The drag chute allowed airplanes to land safely on smaller ice floes.

Most parachutes were made of silk until World War II cut off supplies from Japan. After Adeline Gray made the first jump using a nylon parachute in June 1942, the industry switched to nylon.

== Types ==

Today&#x27;s modern parachutes are classified into two categories – ascending and descending canopies. All ascending canopies refer to paragliders, built specifically to ascend and stay aloft as long as possible. Other parachutes, including ram-air non-elliptical, are classified as descending canopies by manufacturers.

Some modern parachutes are classified as semi-rigid wings, which are maneuverable and can make a controlled descent to collapse on impact with the ground.

=== Round ===
Round parachutes are purely a drag device (that is, unlike the ram-air types, they provide no lift) and are used in military, emergency and cargo applications (e.g. airdrops). Most have large dome-shaped canopies made from a single layer of triangular cloth gores. Some skydivers call them &quot;jellyfish &#x27;chutes&quot; because of the resemblance to the marine organisms. Modern sports parachutists rarely use this type.
The first round parachutes were simple, flat circulars. These early parachutes suffered from instability caused by oscillations. A hole in the apex helped to vent some air and reduce the oscillations. Many military applications adopted conical, i.e., cone-shaped, or parabolic (a flat circular canopy with an extended skirt) shapes, such as the United States Army T-10 static-line parachute. A round parachute with no holes in it is more prone to oscillate and is not considered to be steerable. Some parachutes have inverted dome-shaped canopies. These are primarily used for dropping non-human payloads due to their faster rate of descent.

Forward speed (5–13  km/h) and steering can be achieved by cuts in various sections (gores) across the back, or by cutting four lines in the back, thereby modifying the canopy shape to allow air to escape from the back of the canopy, providing limited forward speed. Other modifications sometimes used are cuts in various gores to cause some of the skirt to bow out. Turning is accomplished by forming the edges of the modifications, giving the parachute more speed from one side of the modification than the other. This gives the jumpers the ability to steer the parachute (such as the United States Army MC series parachutes), enabling them to avoid obstacles and to turn into the wind to minimize horizontal speed at landing.

=== Cruciform ===

The unique design characteristics of cruciform parachutes decrease oscillation (its user swinging back and forth) and violent turns during descent. This technology will be used by the United States Army as it replaces its older T-10 parachutes with T-11 parachutes under a program called Advanced Tactical Parachute System (ATPS). The ATPS canopy is a highly modified version of a cross/ cruciform platform and is square in appearance. The ATPS system will reduce the rate of descent by 30 percent from to . The T-11 is designed to have an average rate of descent 14% slower than the T-10D, thus resulting in lower landing injury rates for jumpers. The decline in the rate of descent will reduce the impact energy by almost 25% to lessen the potential for injury.

=== Pull-down apex ===

A variation on the round parachute is the pull-down apex parachute, invented by a Frenchman named Pierre-Marcel Lemoigne. The first widely used canopy of this type was called the &quot;Para-Commander&quot; (made by the Pioneer Parachute Co.), although there are many other canopies with a pull-down apex produced in the years thereafter - these had minor differences in attempts to make a higher performance rig, such as different venting configurations. They are all considered &#x27;round&#x27; parachutes, but with suspension lines to the canopy apex that apply load there and pull the apex closer to the load, distorting the round shape into a somewhat flattened or lenticular shape when viewed from the side. And while called &quot;rounds&quot;, they generally have an elliptical shape when viewed from above or below, with the sides bulging out more than the for&#x27;d-and-aft dimension, the chord (see the lower photo to the right and you likely can ascertain the difference).

Due to their lenticular shape and appropriate venting, they have a considerably faster forward speed than, say, a modified military canopy. And due to controllable rear-facing vents in the canopy&#x27;s sides, they also have much snappier turning capabilities, though they are decidedly low-performance compared to today&#x27;s ram-air rigs. From about the mid-1960s to the late-1970s, this was the most popular parachute design type for sport parachuting (prior to this period, modified military &#x27;rounds&#x27; were generally used and after, ram-air &#x27;squares&#x27; became common). Note that the use of the word &quot;elliptical&quot; for these &#x27;round&#x27; parachutes is somewhat dated and may cause slight confusion, since some &#x27;squares&#x27; (i.e. ram-airs) are elliptical nowadays, too.

=== Annular ===
Some designs with a pull-down apex have the fabric removed from the apex to open a hole through which air can exit (most, if not all, round canopies have at least a small hole to allow easier tie-down for packing - these aren&#x27;t considered annular), giving the canopy an annular geometry. This hole can be very pronounced in some designs, taking up more &#x27;space&#x27; than the parachute. They also have decreased horizontal drag due to their flatter shape and, when combined with rear-facing vents, can have considerable forward speed. Truly annular designs - with a hole large enough that the canopy can be classified as &quot;ring-shaped&quot; - are uncommon.

=== Rogallo wing ===
Sport parachuting has experimented with the Rogallo wing, among other shapes and forms. These were usually an attempt to increase the forward speed and reduce the landing speed offered by the other options at the time. The ram-air parachute&#x27;s development and the subsequent introduction of the sail slider to slow deployment reduced the level of experimentation in the sport parachuting community. The parachutes are also hard to build.

=== Ribbon and ring ===
Ribbon and ring parachutes have similarities to annular designs. They are frequently designed to deploy at supersonic speeds. A conventional parachute would instantly burst upon opening and be shredded at such speeds. Ribbon parachutes have a ring-shaped canopy, often with a large hole in the centre to release the pressure. Sometimes the ring is broken into ribbons connected by ropes to leak air even more. These large leaks lower the stress on the parachute so it does not burst or shred when it opens. Ribbon parachutes made of Kevlar are used on nuclear bombs, such as the B61 and B83.

=== Ram-air ===
The principle of the Ram-Air Multicell Airfoil was conceived in 1963 by Canadian Domina &quot;Dom&quot; C. Jalbert, but serious problems had to be solved before a ram-air canopy could be marketed to the sport parachuting community. Ram-air parafoils are steerable (as are most canopies used for sport parachuting), and have two layers of fabric—top and bottom—connected by airfoil-shaped fabric ribs to form &quot;cells&quot;. The cells fill with higher-pressure air from vents that face forward on the leading edge of the airfoil. The fabric is shaped and the parachute lines trimmed under load such that the ballooning fabric inflates into an airfoil shape. This airfoil is sometimes maintained by use of fabric one-way valves called &quot;airlocks&quot;. &quot;The first jump of this canopy (a Jalbert Parafoil) was made by International Skydiving Hall of Fame member Paul &#x27;Pop&#x27; Poppenhager.&quot;

==== Varieties ====
Personal ram-air parachutes are loosely divided into two varieties – rectangular or tapered – commonly called &quot;squares&quot; or &quot;ellipticals&quot;, respectively. Medium-performance canopies (reserve-, BASE-, canopy formation-, and accuracy-type) are usually rectangular. High-performance, ram-air parachutes have a slightly tapered shape to their leading and/or trailing edges when viewed in plan form, and are known as ellipticals. Sometimes all the taper is on the leading edge (front), and sometimes in the trailing edge (tail).

Ellipticals are usually used only by sport parachutists. They often have smaller, more numerous fabric cells and are shallower in profile. Their canopies can be anywhere from slightly elliptical to highly elliptical, indicating the amount of taper in the canopy design, which is often an indicator of the responsiveness of the canopy to control input for a given wing loading, and of the level of experience required to pilot the canopy safely.

The rectangular parachute designs tend to look like square, inflatable air mattresses with open front ends. They are generally safer to operate because they are less prone to dive rapidly with relatively small control inputs, they are usually flown with lower wing loadings per square foot of area, and they glide more slowly. They typically have a lower glide ratio.

Wing loading of parachutes is measured similarly to that of aircraft, comparing exit weight to area of parachute fabric. Typical wing loading for students, accuracy competitors, and BASE jumpers is less than 5  kg per square meter – often 0.3 kilograms per square meter or less. Most student skydivers fly with wing loading below 5  kg per square meter. Most sport jumpers fly with wing loading between 5 and 7  kg per square meter, but many interested in performance landings exceed this wing loading. Professional canopy pilots compete with wing loading of 10 to over 15 kilograms per square meter. While ram-air parachutes with wing loading higher than 20 kilograms per square meter have been landed, this is strictly the realm of professional test jumpers.

Smaller parachutes tend to fly faster for the same load, and ellipticals respond faster to control input. Therefore, small, elliptical designs are often chosen by experienced canopy pilots for the thrilling flying they provide. Flying a fast elliptical requires much more skill and experience. Fast ellipticals are also considerably more dangerous to land. With high-performance elliptical canopies, nuisance malfunctions can be much more serious than with a square design, and may quickly escalate into emergencies. Flying highly loaded, elliptical canopies is a major contributing factor in many skydiving accidents, although advanced training programs are helping to reduce this danger.

High-speed, cross-braced parachutes, such as the Velocity, VX, XAOS, and Sensei, have given birth to a new branch of sport parachuting called &quot;swooping.&quot; A race course is set up in the landing area for expert pilots to measure the distance they are able to fly past the tall entry gate. Current world records exceed .

Aspect ratio is another way to measure ram-air parachutes. Aspect ratios of parachutes are measured the same way as aircraft wings, by comparing span with chord. Low aspect ratio parachutes, i.e., span 1.8 times the chord, are now limited to precision landing competitions. Popular precision landing parachutes include Jalbert (now NAA) Para-Foils and John Eiff&#x27;s series of Challenger Classics. While low aspect ratio parachutes tend to be extremely stable, with gentle stall characteristics, they suffer from steep glide ratios and a small tolerance, or &quot;sweet spot&quot;, for timing the landing flare.

Because of their predictable opening characteristics, parachutes with a medium aspect ratio around 2.1 are widely used for reserves, BASE, and canopy formation competition. Most medium aspect ratio parachutes have seven cells.

High aspect ratio parachutes have the flattest glide and the largest tolerance for timing the landing flare, but the least predictable openings. An aspect ratio of 2.7 is about the upper limit for parachutes. High aspect ratio canopies typically have nine or more cells. All reserve ram-air parachutes are of the square variety, because of the greater reliability, and the less-demanding handling characteristics.

=== Paragliders ===

Paragliders - virtually all of which use ram-air canopies - are more akin to today&#x27;s sport parachutes than, say, parachutes of the mid-1970s and earlier. Technically, they are &quot;ascending parachutes&quot;, though that term is not used in the paragliding community, and they have the same basic airfoil design of today&#x27;s &#x27;square&#x27; or &#x27;elliptical&#x27; sports parachuting canopy, but generally have more sectioned cells, higher aspect ratio and a lower profile. Cell count varies widely, typically from the high 20s to the 70s, while aspect ratio can be 8 or more, though aspect ratio (projected) for such a canopy might be down at 6 or so - both outrageously higher than a representative skydiver&#x27;s parachute. The wing span is typically so great that it&#x27;s far closer to a very elongated rectangle or ellipse than a &quot;square&quot; and that term is rarely used by paraglider pilots. Similarly, span might be ~15 m with span (projected) at 12 m. Canopies are still attached to the harness by suspension lines and (four or six) risers, but they use lockable carabiners as the final connection to the harness. Modern high-performance paragliders often have the cell openings closer to the bottom of the leading edge and the end cells might appear to be closed, both for aerodynamic streamlining (these apparently closed end cells are vented and inflated from the adjacent cells, which have venting in the cell walls).

The main difference is in paragliders&#x27; usage, typically longer flights that can last all day and hundreds of kilometres in some cases. The harness is also quite different from a parachuting harness and can vary dramatically from ones for the beginner (which might be just a bench seat with nylon material and webbing to ensure the pilot is secure, no matter the position), to seatboardless ones for high altitude and cross-country flights (these are usually full-body cocoon- or hammock-like devices to include the outstretched legs - called &quot;speedbags&quot;, &quot;aerocones&quot;, etc. - to ensure aerodynamic efficiency and warmth). In many designs, there will be protection for the back and shoulder areas built-in, and support for a reserve canopy, water container, etc. Some even have windshields.

Because paragliders are made for foot- or ski-launch, they aren&#x27;t suitable for terminal velocity openings and there is no slider to slow down an opening (paraglider pilots typically start with an &quot;open&quot; but uninflated canopy). To launch a paraglider, one typically spreads out the canopy on the ground to closely approximate an open canopy with the suspension lines having little slack and less tangle - see more in Paragliding. Depending on the wind, the pilot has three basic options: 1) a running forward launch (typically in no wind or slight wind), 2) a standing launch (in &quot;ideal&quot; winds) and 3) a reverse launch (in higher winds). In ideal winds, the pilot pulls on the top risers to have the wind inflate the cells and simply eases the brakes down, much like an aircraft&#x27;s flaps, and takes off. Or if there is no wind, the pilot runs or skis to make it inflate, typically at the edge of a cliff or hill. Once the canopy is above one&#x27;s head, it&#x27;s a gentle pull down on both toggles in ideal winds, a tow (say, behind a vehicle) on flat ground, a continued run down the hill, etc. Ground handling in a variety of winds is important and there are even canopies made strictly for that practice, to save on wear and tear of more expensive canopies designed for say, XC, competition or just recreational flying.

==== General characteristics ====
Main parachutes used by skydivers today are designed to open softly. Overly rapid deployment was an early problem with ram-air designs. The primary innovation that slows the deployment of a ram-air canopy is the slider; a small rectangular piece of fabric with a grommet near each corner. Four collections of lines go through the grommets to the risers (risers are strips of webbing joining the harness and the rigging lines of a parachute). During deployment, the slider slides down from the canopy to just above the risers. The slider is slowed by air resistance as it descends and reduces the rate at which the lines can spread. This reduces the speed at which the canopy can open and inflate.

At the same time, the overall design of a parachute still has a significant influence on the deployment speed. Modern sport parachutes&#x27; deployment speeds vary considerably. Most modern parachutes open comfortably, but individual skydivers may prefer harsher deployment.

The deployment process is inherently chaotic. Rapid deployments can still occur even with well-behaved canopies. On rare occasions, deployment can even be so rapid that the jumper suffers bruising, injury, or death. Reducing the amount of fabric decreases the air resistance. This can be done by making the slider smaller, inserting a mesh panel, or cutting a hole in the slider.

== Deployment ==

Reserve parachutes usually have a ripcord deployment system, which was first designed by Theodore Moscicki, but most modern main parachutes used by sports parachutists use a form of hand-deployed pilot chute. A ripcord system pulls a closing pin (sometimes multiple pins), which releases a spring-loaded pilot chute, and opens the container; the pilot chute is then propelled into the air stream by its spring, then uses the force generated by passing air to extract a deployment bag containing the parachute canopy, to which it is attached via a bridle. A hand-deployed pilot chute, once thrown into the air stream, pulls a closing pin on the pilot chute bridle to open the container, then the same force extracts the deployment bag. There are variations on hand-deployed pilot chutes, but the system described is the more common throw-out system.

Only the hand-deployed pilot chute may be collapsed automatically after deployment—by a kill line reducing the in-flight drag of the pilot chute on the main canopy. Reserves, on the other hand, do not retain their pilot chutes after deployment. The reserve deployment bag and pilot chute are not connected to the canopy in a reserve system. This is known as a free-bag configuration, and the components are sometimes not recovered after a reserve deployment.

Occasionally, a pilot chute does not generate enough force either to pull the pin or to extract the bag. Causes may be that the pilot chute is caught in the turbulent wake of the jumper (the &quot;burble&quot;), the closing loop holding the pin is too tight, or the pilot chute is generating insufficient force. This effect is known as &quot;pilot chute hesitation,&quot; and, if it does not clear, it can lead to a total malfunction, requiring reserve deployment.

Paratroopers&#x27; main parachutes are usually deployed by static lines that release the parachute, yet retain the deployment bag that contains the parachute—without relying on a pilot chute for deployment. In this configuration, the deployment bag is known as a direct-bag system, in which the deployment is rapid, consistent, and reliable.

== Safety ==

A parachute is carefully folded, or &quot;packed&quot; to ensure that it will open reliably. If a parachute is not packed properly it can result in a malfunction where the main parachute fails to deploy correctly or fully. In the United States and many developed countries, emergency and reserve parachutes are packed by &quot;riggers&quot; who must be trained and certified according to legal standards. Sport skydivers are always trained to pack their own primary &quot;main&quot; parachutes.

Exact numbers are difficult to estimate because parachute design, maintenance, loading, packing technique and operator experience all have a significant impact on malfunction rates. Approximately one in a thousand sport main parachute openings malfunctions, requiring the use of the reserve parachute, although some skydivers have many thousands of jumps and never needed to use their reserve parachute.

Reserve parachutes are packed and deployed somewhat differently. They are also designed more conservatively, favouring reliability over responsiveness and are built and tested to more exacting standards, making them more reliable than main parachutes. Regulated inspection intervals, coupled with significantly less use contributes to reliability as wear on some components can adversely affect reliability. The safety advantage of a reserve parachute comes from the small probability of a main malfunction being multiplied by the even smaller probability of a reserve malfunction. This yields an even smaller probability of a double malfunction, although there is also a small possibility of a malfunctioning main parachute not being able to be released and thus interfering with the reserve parachute. In the United States, the 2017 average fatality rate is recorded to be 1 in 133,571 jumps.

Injuries and fatalities in sport skydiving are possible even under a fully functional main parachute, such as may occur if the skydiver makes an error in judgment while flying the canopy which results in a high-speed impact either with the ground or with a hazard on the ground, which might otherwise have been avoided, or results in collision with another skydiver under canopy.

== Malfunctions ==

Below are listed the malfunctions specific to round parachutes: 
* A &quot;Mae West&quot; or &quot;blown periphery&quot; is a type of round parachute malfunction that contorts the shape of the canopy into the outward appearance of a large brassiere, named after the generous proportions of the late actress Mae West. The column of nylon fabric, buffeted by the wind, rapidly heats from friction and opposite sides of the canopy can fuse together in a narrow region, removing any chance of it opening fully.
*A &quot;streamer&quot; is the main chute which becomes entangled in its lines and fails to deploy, taking the shape of a paper streamer. The parachutist cuts it away to provide space and clean air for deploying the reserve.
* An &quot;inversion&quot; occurs when one skirt of the canopy blows between the suspension lines on the opposite side of the parachute and then catches air. That portion then forms a secondary lobe with the canopy inverted. The secondary lobe grows until the canopy turns completely inside out.
* A &quot;barber&#x27;s pole&quot; describes having a tangle of lines behind the jumper&#x27;s head, who cuts away the main and opens his reserve.
*The &quot;horseshoe&quot; is an out-of-sequence deployment, when the parachute lines and bag are released before the bag drogue and bridle. This can cause the lines to become tangled or a situation where the parachute drogue is not released from the container.
*&quot;Jumper-In-Tow&quot; involves a static line that does not disconnect, resulting in a jumper being towed behind the aircraft.

== Records ==
On August 16, 1960, Joseph Kittinger, in the Excelsior III test jump, set the previous world record for the highest parachute jump. He jumped from a balloon at an altitude of (which was also a piloted balloon altitude record at the time). A small stabilizer chute deployed successfully, and Kittinger fell for 4 minutes and 36 seconds, also setting a still-standing world record for the longest parachute free-fall, if falling with a stabilizer chute is counted as free-fall. At an altitude of , Kittinger opened his main chute and landed safely in the New Mexico desert. The whole descent took 13 minutes and 45 seconds. During the descent, Kittinger experienced temperatures as low as . In the free-fall stage, he reached a top speed of 614 mph (988 km/h or 274 m/s), or Mach 0.8.

According to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, Yevgeni Andreyev, a colonel in the Soviet Air Force, held the official FAI record for the longest free-fall parachute jump (without drogue chute) after falling for 24,500 m (80,380 ft) from an altitude of 25,457 m (83,523 ft) near the city of Saratov, Russia on November 1, 1962, until broken by Felix Baumgartner in 2012.

Felix Baumgartner broke Joseph Kittinger&#x27;s record on October 14, 2012, with a jump from an altitude of 127,852 feet (38,969.3 m) and reaching speeds up to 833.9 mph (1,342.0 km/h or 372.8 m/s), or nearly Mach 1.1. Kittinger was an advisor for Baumgartner&#x27;s jump.

Alan Eustace made a jump from the stratosphere on October 24, 2014, from an altitude of 135,889.108 feet (41,419 m). However, because Eustace&#x27;s jump involved a drogue parachute while Baumgartner&#x27;s did not, their vertical speed and free fall distance records remain in different record categories.

== Uses ==
In addition to the use of a parachute to slow the descent of a person or object, a drogue parachute is used to aid horizontal deceleration of a land or air vehicle, including fixed-wing aircraft and drag racers, provide stability, as to assist certain types of light aircraft in distress, tandem free-fall; and as a pilot triggering deployment of a larger parachute.

Parachutes are also used as play equipment.

<text>Pesticides are substances that are used to control pests. They include herbicides, insecticides, nematicides, fungicides, and many others (see table). The most common of these are herbicides, which account for approximately 50% of all pesticide use globally. Most pesticides are used as plant protection products (also known as crop protection products), which in general protect plants from weeds, fungi, or insects. In general, a pesticide is a chemical or biological agent (such as a virus, bacterium, or fungus) that deters, incapacitates, kills, or otherwise discourages pests. Target pests can include insects, plant pathogens, weeds, molluscs, birds, mammals, fish, nematodes (roundworms), and microbes that destroy property, cause nuisance, or spread disease, or are disease vectors. Along with these benefits, pesticides also have drawbacks, such as potential toxicity to humans and other species.

==Definition==
The word pesticide derives from the Latin &quot;pestis&quot; (plague) and &quot;caedere&quot; (kill).

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has defined &quot;pesticide&quot; as:
: any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, or controlling any pest, including vectors of human or animal disease, unwanted species of plants or animals, causing harm during or otherwise interfering with the production, processing, storage, transport, or marketing of food, agricultural commodities, wood and wood products or animal feedstuffs, or substances that may be administered to animals for the control of insects, arachnids, or other pests in or on their bodies. The term includes substances intended for use as a plant growth regulator, defoliant, desiccant, or agent for thinning fruit or preventing the premature fall of fruit. Also used as substances applied to crops either before or after harvest to protect the commodity from deterioration during storage and transport.

=== Classifications ===
Pesticides can be classified by target organism (e.g., herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides, and pediculicides – see table),

Biopesticides according to the EPA include microbial pesticides, biochemical pesticides, and plant-incorporated protectants.

Pesticides can be classified into structural classes, with many structural classes developed for each of the target organisms listed in the table. A structural class is usually associated with a single mode of action, whereas a mode of action may encompass more than one structural class.

The pesticidal chemical (active ingredient) is mixed (formulated) with other components to form the product that is sold, and which is applied in various ways. Pesticides in gas form are fumigants.

Pesticides can be classified based upon their mode of action, which indicates the exact biological mechanism which the pesticide disrupts. The modes of action are important for resistance management, and are categorized and administered by the insecticide, herbicide, and fungicide resistance action committees.

Pesticides may be systemic or non-systemic. A systemic pesticide moves (translocates) inside the plant. Translocation may be upward in the xylem, or downward in the phloem or both. Non-systemic pesticides (contact pesticides) remain on the surface and act through direct contact with the target organism. Pesticides are more effective if they are systemic. Systemicity is a prerequisite for the pesticide to be used as a seed-treatment.

Pesticides can be classified as persistent (non-biodegradable) or non-persistent (biodegradable). A pesticide must be persistent enough to kill or control its target but must degrade fast enough not to accumulate in the environment or the food chain in order to be approved by the authorities. Persistent pesticides, including DDT, were banned many years ago, an exception being spraying in houses to combat malaria vectors.

== History ==
From ancient times until the 1950s the pesticides used were inorganic compounds and plant extracts. The inorganic compounds were derivatives of copper, arsenic, mercury, sulfur, among others, and the plant extracts contained pyrethrum, nicotine, and rotenone among others. The less toxic of these are still in use in organic farming. In the 1940s the insecticide DDT, and the herbicide 2,4-D, were introduced. These synthetic organic compounds were widely used and were very profitable. They were followed in the 1950s and 1960s by numerous other synthetic pesticides, which led to the growth of the pesticide industry. During this period, it became increasingly evident that DDT, which had been sprayed widely in the environment to combat the vector, had accumulated in the food chain. It had become a global pollutant, as summarized in the well-known book Silent Spring. Finally, DDT was banned in the 1970s in several countries, and subsequently all persistent pesticides were banned worldwide, an exception being spraying on interior walls for vector control.

Resistance to a pesticide was first seen in the 1920s with inorganic pesticides, and later it was found that development of resistance is to be expected, and measures to delay it are important. Integrated pest management (IPM) was introduced in the 1950s. By careful analysis and spraying only when an economical or biological threshold of crop damage is reached, pesticide application is reduced. This became in the 2020s the official policy of international organisations, industry, and many governments. With the introduction of high yielding varieties in the 1960s in the green revolution, more pesticides were used. Since the 1980s genetically modified crops were introduced, which resulted in lower amounts of insecticides used on them. Organic agriculture, which uses only non-synthetic pesticides, has grown and in 2020 represents about 1.5 per cent of the world&#x27;s total agricultural land.

Pesticides have become more effective. Application rates fell from 1,000 to 2,500 grams of active ingredient per hectare (g/ha) in the 1950s to 40–100 g/ha in the 2000s. Despite this, amounts used have increased. In high income countries over 20 years between the 1990s and 2010s amounts used increased 20%, while in the low income countries amounts increased 1623%.

== Development of new pesticides ==
The aim is to find new compounds or agents with improved properties such as a new mode of action or lower application rate. Another aim is to replace older pesticides which have been banned for reasons of toxicity or environmental harm or have become less effective due to development of resistance.

The process starts with testing (screening) against target organisms such as insects, fungi or plants. Inputs are typically random compounds, natural products, compounds designed to disrupt a biochemical target, compounds described in patents or literature, or biocontrol organisms.

Compounds that are active in the screening process, known as hits or leads, cannot be used as pesticides, except for biocontrol organisms and some potent natural products. These lead compounds need to be optimised by a series of cycles of synthesis and testing of analogs. For approval by regulatory authorities for use as pesticides, the optimized compounds must meet several requirements. In addition to being potent (low application rate), they must show low toxicity to non-target organisms, low environmental impact, and viable manufacturing cost. The cost of developing a pesticide in 2022 was estimated to be 350 million US dollars. It has become more difficult to find new pesticides. More than 100 new active ingredients were introduced in the 2000s and less than 40 in the 2010s. Biopesticides are cheaper to develop, since the authorities require less toxicological and environmental study. Since 2000 the rate of new biological product introduction has frequently exceeded that of conventional products.

More than 25% of existing chemical pesticides contain one or more chiral centres (stereogenic centres). Newer pesticides with lower application rates tend to have more complex structures, and thus more often contain chiral centres. In cases when most or all of the pesticidal activity in a new compound is found in one enantiomer (the eutomer), the registration and use of the compound as this single enantiomer is preferred. This reduces the total application rate and avoids the tedious environmental testing required when registering a racemate. However, if a viable enantioselective manufacturing route cannot be found, then the racemate is registered and used.

==Uses==

In addition to their main use in agriculture, pesticides have a number of other applications. Pesticides are used to control organisms that are considered to be harmful, or pernicious to their surroundings. For example, they are used to kill mosquitoes that can transmit potentially deadly diseases like West Nile virus, yellow fever, and malaria. They can also kill bees, wasps or ants that can cause allergic reactions. Insecticides can protect animals from illnesses that can be caused by parasites such as fleas. Pesticides can prevent sickness in humans that could be caused by moldy food or diseased produce. Herbicides can be used to clear roadside weeds, trees, and brush. They can also kill invasive weeds that may cause environmental damage. Herbicides are commonly applied in ponds and lakes to control algae and plants such as water grasses that can interfere with activities like swimming and fishing and cause the water to look or smell unpleasant. Uncontrolled pests such as termites and mold can damage structures such as houses. Pesticides are used in grocery stores and food storage facilities to manage rodents and insects that infest food such as grain. Pesticides are used on lawns and golf courses, partly for cosmetic reasons.

Integrated pest management, the use of multiple approaches to control pests, is becoming widespread and has been used with success in countries such as Indonesia, China, Bangladesh, the U.S., Australia, and Mexico. IPM attempts to recognize the more widespread impacts of an action on an ecosystem, so that natural balances are not upset.

Each use of a pesticide carries some associated risk. Proper pesticide use decreases these associated risks to a level deemed acceptable by pesticide regulatory agencies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) of Canada.

DDT, sprayed on the walls of houses, is an organochlorine that has been used to fight malaria vectors (mosquitos) since the 1940s. The World Health Organization recommend this approach. It and other organochlorine pesticides have been banned in most countries worldwide because of their persistence in the environment and human toxicity. DDT has become less effective, as resistance was identified in Africa as early as 1955, and by 1972 nineteen species of mosquito worldwide were resistant to DDT.

==Amount used==

Total pesticides use in agriculture in 2021 was 3.54 million tonnes of active ingredients (Mt), a 4 percent increase with respect to 2020, an 11 percent increase in a decade, and a doubling since 1990. Pesticides use per area of cropland in 2021 was 2.26 kg per hectare (kg/ha), an increase of 4 percent with respect to 2020; use per value of agricultural production was 0.86 kg per thousand international dollar (kg/1000 I$) (+2%); and use per person was 0.45 kg per capita (kg/cap) (+3%). Between 1990 and 2021, these indicators increased by 85 percent, 3 percent, and 33 percent, respectively. Brazil was the world&#x27;s largest user of pesticides in 2021, with 720 kt of pesticides applications for agricultural use, while the USA (457 kt) was the second-largest user.

Applications per cropland area in 2021 varied widely, from 10.9 kg/hectare in Brazil to 0.8 kg/ha in the Russian Federation. The level in Brazil was about twice as high as in Argentina (5.6 kg/ha) and Indonesia (5.3 kg/ha). Insecticide use in the US has declined by more than half since 1980 (0.6%/yr), mostly due to the near phase-out of organophosphates. In corn fields, the decline was even steeper, due to the switchover to transgenic Bt corn.

==Benefits==
Pesticides increase agricultural yields and lower costs. One study found that not using pesticides reduced crop yields by about 10%. Another study, conducted in 1999, found that a ban on pesticides in the United States may result in a rise of food prices, loss of jobs, and an increase in world hunger.

There are two levels of benefits for pesticide use, primary and secondary. Primary benefits are direct gains from the use of pesticides and secondary benefits are effects that are more long-term.

===Biological===
Controlling pests and plant disease vectors
*Improved crop yields
*Improved crop/livestock quality
*Invasive species controlled

Controlling human/livestock disease vectors and nuisance organisms
*Human lives saved and disease reduced. Diseases controlled include malaria, with millions of lives having been saved or enhanced with the use of DDT alone.
*Animal lives saved and disease reduced

Controlling organisms that harm other human activities and structures
*Drivers view unobstructed
*Tree/brush/leaf hazards prevented
*Wooden structures protected

===Economics===
In 2018 world pesticide sales were estimated to be $65 billion, of which 88% was used for agriculture. Generic accounted for 85% of sales in 2018. In one study, it was estimated that for every dollar ($1) that is spent on pesticides for crops results in up to four dollars ($4) in crops which would otherwise be lost to insects, fungi and weeds. In general, farmers benefit from having an increase in crop yield and from being able to grow a variety of crops throughout the year. Consumers of agricultural products also benefit from being able to afford the vast quantities of produce available year-round.

==Disadvantages==
On the cost side of pesticide use there can be costs to the environment and costs to human health. Pesticides safety education and pesticide applicator regulation are designed to protect the public from pesticide misuse, but do not eliminate all misuse. Reducing the use of pesticides and choosing less toxic pesticides may reduce risks placed on society and the environment from pesticide use.

===Health effects===


Pesticides may affect health negatively. mimicking hormones causing reproductive problems, and also causing cancer. A 2007 systematic review found that &quot;most studies on non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia showed positive associations with pesticide exposure&quot; and thus concluded that cosmetic use of pesticides should be decreased. There is substantial evidence of associations between organophosphate insecticide exposures and neurobehavioral alterations. Limited evidence also exists for other negative outcomes from pesticide exposure including neurological, birth defects, and fetal death.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limiting exposure of children to pesticides and using safer alternatives:

Pesticides are also found in majority of U.S. households with 88 million out of the 121.1 million households indicating that they use some form of pesticide in 2012. As of 2007, there were more than 1,055 active ingredients registered as pesticides, which yield over 20,000 pesticide products that are marketed in the United States.

Owing to inadequate regulation and safety precautions, 99% of pesticide-related deaths occur in developing countries that account for only 25% of pesticide usage.

One study found pesticide self-poisoning the method of choice in one third of suicides worldwide, and recommended, among other things, more restrictions on the types of pesticides that are most harmful to humans.

A 2014 epidemiological review found associations between autism and exposure to certain pesticides, but noted that the available evidence was insufficient to conclude that the relationship was causal.

==== Occupational exposure among agricultural workers ====
The World Health Organization and the UN Environment Programme estimate that 3 million agricultural workers in the developing world experience severe poisoning from pesticides each year, resulting in 18,000 deaths. According to one study, as many as 25 million workers in developing countries may suffer mild pesticide poisoning yearly. Other occupational exposures besides agricultural workers, including pet groomers, groundskeepers, and fumigators, may also put individuals at risk of health effects from pesticides.

Pesticide use is widespread in Latin America, as around US$3 billion are spent each year in the region. Records indicate an increase in the frequency of pesticide poisonings over the past two decades. The most common incidents of pesticide poisoning is thought to result from exposure to organophosphate and carbamate insecticides. At-home pesticide use, use of unregulated products, and the role of undocumented workers within the agricultural industry makes characterizing true pesticide exposure a challenge. It is estimated that 50–80% of pesticide poisoning cases are unreported.

Underreporting of pesticide poisoning is especially common in areas where agricultural workers are less likely to seek care from a healthcare facility that may be monitoring or tracking the incidence of acute poisoning. The extent of unintentional pesticide poisoning may be much greater than available data suggest, particularly among developing countries. Globally, agriculture and food production remain one of the largest industries. In East Africa, the agricultural industry represents one of the largest sectors of the economy, with nearly 80% of its population relying on agriculture for income. Farmers in these communities rely on pesticide products to maintain high crop yields.

Some East Africa governments are shifting to corporate farming, and opportunities for foreign conglomerates to operate commercial farms have led to more accessible research on pesticide use and exposure among workers. In other areas where large proportions of the population rely on subsistence, small-scale farming, estimating pesticide use and exposure is more difficult.

==== Pesticide poisoning ====

Pesticides may exhibit toxic effects on humans and other non-target species, the severity of which depends on the frequency and magnitude of exposure. Toxicity also depends on the rate of absorption, distribution within the body, metabolism, and elimination of compounds from the body. Commonly used pesticides like organophosphates and carbamates act by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase activity, which prevents the breakdown of acetylcholine at the neural synapse. Excess acetylcholine can lead to symptoms like muscle cramps or tremors, confusion, dizziness and nausea. Studies show that farm workers in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Zimbabwe have decreased concentrations of plasma acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme responsible for breaking down acetylcholine acting on synapses throughout the nervous system. Other studies in Ethiopia have observed reduced respiratory function among farm workers who spray crops with pesticides. Numerous exposure pathways for farm workers increase the risk of pesticide poisoning, including dermal absorption walking through fields and applying products, as well as inhalation exposure.

==== Measuring exposure to pesticides ====
There are multiple approaches to measuring a person&#x27;s exposure to pesticides, each of which provides an estimate of an individual&#x27;s internal dose. Two broad approaches include measuring biomarkers and markers of biological effect. The former involves taking direct measurement of the parent compound or its metabolites in various types of media: urine, blood, serum. Biomarkers may include a direct measurement of the compound in the body before it&#x27;s been biotransformed during metabolism. Other suitable biomarkers may include the metabolites of the parent compound after they&#x27;ve been biotransformed during metabolism. Toxicokinetic data can provide more detailed information on how quickly the compound is metabolized and eliminated from the body, and provide insights into the timing of exposure.

Markers of biological effect provide an estimation of exposure based on cellular activities related to the mechanism of action. For example, many studies investigating exposure to pesticides often involve the quantification of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme at the neural synapse to determine the magnitude of the inhibitory effect of organophosphate and carbamate pesticides.

Another method of quantifying exposure involves measuring, at the molecular level, the amount of pesticide interacting with the site of action. These methods are more commonly used for occupational exposures where the mechanism of action is better understood, as described by WHO guidelines published in &quot;Biological Monitoring of Chemical Exposure in the Workplace&quot;. Better understanding of how pesticides elicit their toxic effects is needed before this method of exposure assessment can be applied to occupational exposure of agricultural workers.

Alternative methods to assess exposure include questionnaires to discern from participants whether they are experiencing symptoms associated with pesticide poisoning. Self-reported symptoms may include headaches, dizziness, nausea, joint pain, or respiratory symptoms.

===== Challenges in assessing pesticide exposure =====
Multiple challenges exist in assessing exposure to pesticides in the general population, and many others that are specific to occupational exposures of agricultural workers. Beyond farm workers, estimating exposure to family members and children presents additional challenges, and may occur through &quot;take-home&quot; exposure from pesticide residues collected on clothing or equipment belonging to parent farm workers and inadvertently brought into the home. Children may also be exposed to pesticides prenatally from mothers who are exposed to pesticides during pregnancy. Characterizing children&#x27;s exposure resulting from drift of airborne and spray application of pesticides is similarly challenging, yet well documented in developing countries. Because of critical development periods of the fetus and newborn children, these non-working populations are more vulnerable to the effects of pesticides, and may be at increased risk of developing neurocognitive effects and impaired development.

While measuring biomarkers or markers of biological effects may provide more accurate estimates of exposure, collecting these data in the field is often impractical and many methods are not sensitive enough to detect low-level concentrations. Rapid cholinesterase test kits exist to collect blood samples in the field. Conducting large scale assessments of agricultural workers in remote regions of developing countries makes the implementation of these kits a challenge. The cholinesterase assay is a useful clinical tool to assess individual exposure and acute toxicity. Considerable variability in baseline enzyme activity among individuals makes it difficult to compare field measurements of cholinesterase activity to a reference dose to determine health risk associated with exposure. Another challenge in deriving a reference dose is identifying health endpoints that are relevant to exposure. More epidemiological research is needed to identify critical health endpoints, particularly among populations who are occupationally exposed.

==== Prevention ====
Minimizing harmful exposure to pesticides can be achieved by proper use of personal protective equipment, adequate reentry times into recently sprayed areas, and effective product labeling for hazardous substances as per FIFRA regulations. Training high-risk populations, including agricultural workers, on the proper use and storage of pesticides, can reduce the incidence of acute pesticide poisoning and potential chronic health effects associated with exposure. Continued research into the human toxic health effects of pesticides serves as a basis for relevant policies and enforceable standards that are health protective to all populations.

===Environmental effects===

Pesticide use raises a number of environmental concerns. Over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, including non-target species, air, water and soil. Pesticide drift occurs when pesticides suspended in the air as particles are carried by wind to other areas, potentially contaminating them. Pesticides are one of the causes of water pollution, and some pesticides were persistent organic pollutants (now banned), which contribute to soil and flower (pollen, nectar) contamination. Furthermore, pesticide use can adversely impact neighboring agricultural activity, as pests themselves drift to and harm nearby crops that have no pesticide used on them.

In addition, pesticide use reduces invertebrate biodiversity in streams, contributes to pollinator decline, destroys habitat (especially for birds), and threatens endangered species. Pests can develop a resistance to the pesticide (pesticide resistance), necessitating a new pesticide. Alternatively a greater dose of the pesticide can be used to counteract the resistance, although this will cause a worsening of the ambient pollution problem.

The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants banned all persistent pesticides, in particular DDT and other organochlorine pesticides, which were stable and lipophilic, and thus able to bioaccumulate in the body and the food chain. and which spread throughout the planet. Persistent pesticides are no longer used for agriculture, and will not be approved by the authorities. Because the half life in soil is long (for DDT 2–15 years) residues can still be detected in humans at levels 5 to 10 times lower than found in the 1970s.

Pesticides now have to be degradable in the environment. Such degradation of pesticides is due to both innate chemical properties of the compounds and environmental processes or conditions. For example, the presence of halogens within a chemical structure often slows down degradation in an aerobic environment. Adsorption to soil may retard pesticide movement, but also may reduce bioavailability to microbial degraders.

Pesticide contamination in the environment can be monitored through bioindicators such as bee pollinators.

===Economics===
In one study, the human health and environmental costs due to pesticides in the United States was estimated to be $9.6 billion: offset by about $40 billion in increased agricultural production.

Additional costs include the registration process and the cost of purchasing pesticides: which are typically borne by agrichemical companies and farmers respectively. The registration process can take several years to complete (there are 70 types of field tests) and can cost $50–70 million for a single pesticide. At the beginning of the 21st century, the United States spent approximately $10 billion on pesticides annually.

==Resistance==

The use of pesticides inherently entails the risk of resistance developing. Various techniques and procedures of pesticide application can slow the development of resistance, as can some natural features of the target population and surrounding environment.

==Alternatives==
Alternatives to pesticides are available and include methods of cultivation, use of biological pest controls (such as pheromones and microbial pesticides), genetic engineering (mostly of crops), and methods of interfering with insect breeding. Application of composted yard waste has also been used as a way of controlling pests.

These methods are becoming increasingly popular and often are safer than traditional chemical pesticides. In addition, EPA is registering reduced-risk pesticides in increasing numbers.

===Cultivation practices===
Cultivation practices include polyculture (growing multiple types of plants), crop rotation, planting crops in areas where the pests that damage them do not live, timing planting according to when pests will be least problematic, and use of trap crops that attract pests away from the real crop. Trap crops have successfully controlled pests in some commercial agricultural systems while reducing pesticide usage. In other systems, trap crops can fail to reduce pest densities at a commercial scale, even when the trap crop works in controlled experiments.

===Use of other organisms===
Release of other organisms that fight the pest is another example of an alternative to pesticide use. These organisms can include natural predators or parasites of the pests. Biological pesticides based on entomopathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses causing disease in the pest species can also be used.

===Biological control engineering===
Interfering with insects&#x27; reproduction can be accomplished by sterilizing males of the target species and releasing them, so that they mate with females but do not produce offspring. This technique was first used on the screwworm fly in 1958 and has since been used with the medfly, the tsetse fly, and the gypsy moth. This is a costly and slow approach that only works on some types of insects.

===Other alternatives===
Other alternatives include &quot;laserweeding&quot; – the use of novel agricultural robots for weed control using lasers.

===Push pull strategy===
Push-pull technique: intercropping with a &quot;push&quot; crop that repels the pest, and planting a &quot;pull&quot; crop on the boundary that attracts and traps it.

=== Effectiveness ===
Some evidence shows that alternatives to pesticides can be equally effective as the use of chemicals. A study of Maize fields in northern Florida found that the application of composted yard waste with high carbon to nitrogen ratio to agricultural fields was highly effective at reducing the population of plant-parasitic nematodes and increasing crop yield, with yield increases ranging from 10% to 212%; the observed effects were long-term, often not appearing until the third season of the study. Additional silicon nutrition protects some horticultural crops against fungal diseases almost completely, while insufficient silicon sometimes leads to severe infection even when fungicides are used.

Pesticide resistance is increasing and that may make alternatives more attractive.

==Types==
===Biopesticides===

Biopesticides are certain types of pesticides derived from such natural materials as animals, plants, bacteria, and certain minerals. For example, canola oil and baking soda have pesticidal applications and are considered biopesticides. Biopesticides fall into three major classes:

* Microbial pesticides which consist of bacteria, entomopathogenic fungi or viruses (and sometimes includes the metabolites that bacteria or fungi produce). Entomopathogenic nematodes are also often classed as microbial pesticides, even though they are multi-cellular.
* Biochemical pesticides or herbal pesticides are naturally occurring substances that control (or monitor in the case of pheromones) pests and microbial diseases.
* Plant-incorporated protectants (PIPs) have genetic material from other species incorporated into their genetic material (&quot;i.e.&quot; GM crops). Their use is controversial, especially in many European countries.

===By pest type===
Pesticides that are related to the type of pests are:
==Regulation==
===International===
In many countries, pesticides must be approved for sale and use by a government agency.

Worldwide, 85% of countries have pesticide legislation for the proper storage of pesticides and 51% include provisions to ensure proper disposal of all obsolete pesticides.

Though pesticide regulations differ from country to country, pesticides, and products on which they were used are traded across international borders. To deal with inconsistencies in regulations among countries, delegates to a conference of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization adopted an International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides in 1985 to create voluntary standards of pesticide regulation for many countries. The Code was updated in 1998 and 2002. The FAO claims that the code has raised awareness about pesticide hazards and decreased the number of countries without restrictions on pesticide use.

Three other efforts to improve regulation of international pesticide trade are the United Nations London Guidelines for the Exchange of Information on Chemicals in International Trade and the United Nations Codex Alimentarius Commission. The former seeks to implement procedures for ensuring that prior informed consent exists between countries buying and selling pesticides, while the latter seeks to create uniform standards for maximum levels of pesticide residues among participating countries.

===United States===

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for regulating pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA).

Studies must be conducted to establish the conditions in which the material is safe to use and the effectiveness against the intended pest(s). The EPA regulates pesticides to ensure that these products do not pose adverse effects to humans or the environment, with an emphasis on the health and safety of children. Pesticides produced before November 1984 continue to be reassessed in order to meet the current scientific and regulatory standards. All registered pesticides are reviewed every 15 years to ensure they meet the proper standards. During the registration process, a label is created. The label contains directions for proper use of the material in addition to safety restrictions. Based on acute toxicity, pesticides are assigned to a Toxicity Class. Pesticides are the most thoroughly tested chemicals after drugs in the United States; those used on food require more than 100 tests to determine a range of potential impacts.

Some pesticides are considered too hazardous for sale to the general public and are designated restricted use pesticides. Only certified applicators, who have passed an exam, may purchase or supervise the application of restricted use pesticides. Records of sales and use are required to be maintained and may be audited by government agencies charged with the enforcement of pesticide regulations. These records must be made available to employees and state or territorial environmental regulatory agencies.

In addition to the EPA, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set standards for the level of pesticide residue that is allowed on or in crops. The EPA looks at what the potential human health and environmental effects might be associated with the use of the pesticide.

In addition, the U.S. EPA uses the National Research Council&#x27;s four-step process for human health risk assessment: (1) Hazard Identification, (2) Dose-Response Assessment, (3) Exposure Assessment, and (4) Risk Characterization.

In 2013 Kaua&#x27;i County (Hawai&#x27;i) passed Bill No. 2491 to add an article to Chapter 22 of the county&#x27;s code relating to pesticides and GMOs. The bill strengthens protections of local communities in Kaua&#x27;i where many large pesticide companies test their products.

The first legislation providing federal authority for regulating pesticides was enacted in 1910.

===Canada===
===EU===

EU legislation has been approved banning the use of highly toxic pesticides including those that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction, those that are endocrine-disrupting, and those that are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) or very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB) and measures have been approved to improve the general safety of pesticides across all EU member states.

In 2023 The Environment Committee of European Parliament approved a decision aiming to reduce pesticide use by 50% (the most hazardous by 65%) by the year 2030 and ensure sustainable use of pesticides (for example use them only as a last resort). The decision also includes measures for providing farmers with alternatives.

==Residue==
Pesticide residue refers to the pesticides that may remain on or in food after they are applied to food crops. The maximum residue limits (MRL) of pesticides in food are carefully set by the regulatory authorities to ensure, to their best judgement, no health impacts. Regulations such as pre-harvest intervals also often prevent harvest of crop or livestock products if recently treated in order to allow residue concentrations to decrease over time to safe levels before harvest. Exposure of the general population to these residues most commonly occurs through consumption of treated food sources, or being in close contact to areas treated with pesticides such as farms or lawns.

Persistent pesticides are no longer used for agriculture, and will not be approved by the authorities. Because the half life in soil is long (for DDT 2–15 years) residues can still be detected in humans at levels 5 to 10 times lower than found in the 1970s.

Residues are monitored by the authorities. In 2016, over 99% of samples of US produce had no pesticide residue or had residue levels well below the EPA tolerance levels for each pesticide.

<text>The Tripartite Pact, also known as the Berlin Pact, was an agreement between Germany, Italy, and Japan signed in Berlin on 27 September 1940 by, respectively, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Galeazzo Ciano, and Saburō Kurusu (in that order) and in the presence of Adolf Hitler. It was a defensive military alliance that was eventually joined by Hungary (20 November 1940), Romania (23 November 1940), Slovakia (24 November 1940), Bulgaria (1 March 1941), and Yugoslavia (25 March 1941). Yugoslavia&#x27;s accession provoked a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in Belgrade two days later. Germany, Italy, and Hungary responded by invading Yugoslavia. The resulting Italo-German client state, known as the Independent State of Croatia, joined the pact on 15 June 1941.

The Tripartite Pact was, together with the Anti-Comintern Pact and the Pact of Steel, one of a number of agreements between Germany, Japan, Italy, and other countries of the Axis Powers governing their relationship.

The Tripartite Pact formally allied the Axis Powers with one another, and it was directed primarily at the United States. Because of the long distance between Japan and the two European Powers, the pact recognized two different regions that were to be under Axis rule. Japan recognized &quot;the leadership of Germany and Italy in the establishment of a new order in Europe&quot;. In return, Germany and Italy recognized Japan&#x27;s right to establish a new order &quot;in Greater East Asia&quot;. But the pact&#x27;s practical effects were limited since the Italo-German and Japanese operational theatres were on opposite sides of the world, and the high contracting powers had disparate strategic interests. As such, the Axis was only ever a loose alliance. Its defensive clauses were never invoked, and signing the agreement did not oblige its signatories to fight a common war &quot;per se&quot;.

==Text==

==Background==


Although Germany and Japan technically became allies with the signing of Anti-Comintern Pact of 1936, the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union came as a surprise to Japan. In November 1939, Germany and Japan signed the &quot;Agreement for Cultural Cooperation between Japan and Germany&quot;, which restored the &quot;reluctant alliance&quot; between them.

==Later signatories==
In a ceremonial speech following the signing of the pact on 27 September, Ribbentrop may have suggested that the signatories were open to accepting new signatories in the future. The &quot;Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; (DAZ) reported his words as follows:

The purpose of the Pact is, above all things, to help restore peace to the world as quickly as possible. Therefore any other State which wishes to accede to this bloc (&quot;der diesem Block beitreten will&quot;), with the intention of contributing to the restoration of peaceful conditions, will be sincerely and gratefully made welcome and will participate in the economic and political reorganisation.

The official &quot;&quot; (DNB), however, as well as most of the press, reported a slightly different version in which the words &quot;having good will towards the pact&quot; (&quot;der diesem Pakt wohlwollend gegenübertreten will&quot;) instead of &quot;accede to&quot; were used. It is likely that other nations were not envisioned to join the treaty and that Ribbentrop misspoke. The official record in the DNB, therefore, corrected his words to remove any reference to &quot;accession&quot; by other states but produced an awkward wording in the process.

The Italian foreign minister, Ciano, was resolutely opposed to the idea of adding smaller states to the pact as late as 20 November 1940; he argued in his diary that they weakened the pact and were useless bits of diplomacy.

===Hungary===
The Kingdom of Hungary was the fourth state to sign the pact and the first to join it after 27 September 1940. The Hungarian ambassador in Berlin, Döme Sztójay, telegraphed his foreign minister, István Csáky, immediately after news of the signing and of Ribbentrop&#x27;s speech had reached him. He urged Csáky to join the pact and even claimed that it was the expectation of Germany and Italy that he would do so. He considered it especially important for Hungary to sign the pact before Romania did. In response, Csáky asked Sztójay and the ambassador in Rome, Frigyes Villani, to make enquiries regarding Hungary&#x27;s accession and its potential obligations under the pact. On 28 September, the German secretary of state for foreign affairs, Ernst von Weizsäcker, informed Hungary that Ribbentrop had meant not a &quot;formal accession&quot; but merely &quot;an attitude in the spirit of the Pact&quot;. The Italian answer was similar. Nonetheless, within a week, the Hungarian government had sent out formal notice of its &quot;spiritual adherence&quot; to the pact.

In the week after Hungary&#x27;s &quot;spiritual adherence&quot;, the Balkan situation changed. Romania granted a German request to send troops to guard the Ploiești oil fields, and Hungary granted a German request to allow its troops to transit Hungary to get to Romania. On 7 October 1940, the first German troops arrived in Ploiești. It is probable that Romania&#x27;s accession to the pact had been delayed until the German troops were in place for fear of the Soviets taking pre-emptive action to secure the oil fields for themselves. In turn, Hungary&#x27;s accession had been delayed until Romania&#x27;s had been negotiated. On about 9 October, Weizsäcker delivered a message from Ribbentrop to Sztójay to inform him that Hitler now wanted &quot;friendly states&quot; to join the pact. In a telephone conversation with Ciano on 9 or 10 October, Ribbentrop claimed that Hungary had sent a second request to join the pact. Mussolini reluctantly consented. On 12 October, Ribbentrop informed Sztójay that both Italy and Japan had consented to Hungary&#x27;s accession. Since the Hungarian regent, Miklós Horthy, had specifically instructed Sztójay to ask for Hungary to be the first new state to accede to the pact, Ribbentrop granted the request.

===Romania===
The Kingdom of Romania had joined the Allied Powers in World War I and had received Transylvania from Austria-Hungary. After Germany and Italy awarded parts of Transylvania back to Hungary and Southern Dobruja back to Bulgaria and after the Soviet Union had taken Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, the Fascist Iron Guard party came to power and Romania joined the Tripartite Pact on November 23, 1940, because of the Romanian desire for protection against the Soviet Union.

In Marshal Ion Antonescu&#x27;s affidavit read out at the IG Farben Trial (1947–1948), he stated that the agreement on entering the pact had been concluded before his visit to Berlin on 22 November 1940.

===Slovakia===
On 14 March 1939, the Slovak Republic was declared in the midst of the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. Hitler invited Monsignor Jozef Tiso to be the new nation&#x27;s leader. Soon after it was formed, Slovakia was involved in a war with neighboring Hungary. Slovakia had signed a &quot;Protection Treaty&quot; with Germany, which, however, refused to intervene. The war resulted in territorial gains by Hungary at Slovakia&#x27;s expense. Even so, Slovakia supported the German invasion of Poland in 1939.

Shortly after the signing of the Tripartite Pact, Slovakia, following the Hungarian lead, sent messages of &quot;spiritual adherence&quot; to Germany and Italy.

On 24 November 1940, the day after Romania signed the pact, the Slovak prime minister and foreign minister, Vojtech Tuka, went to Berlin to meet Ribbentrop and signed Slovakia&#x27;s accession to the Tripartite Pact. His purpose was to increase Tuka&#x27;s standing in Slovakia relative to that of his rival, Tiso, although the Germans had no intention of permitting Tiso to be removed.

===Bulgaria===

The Tsardom of Bulgaria had been an ally of Germany and on the losing side in World War I. From the beginning, the Germans pressured Bulgaria to join the Tripartite Pact. On 17 November 1940, Tsar Boris III and Foreign Minister met with Hitler in Germany. According to Hermann Neubacher, Germany&#x27;s special envoy to the Balkans, Bulgaria&#x27;s relation to the Axis powers was completely settled at that meeting. On 23 November, however, the Bulgarian ambassador in Berlin, Peter Draganov, informed the Germans that while Bulgaria had agreed in principle to join the pact, it wished to delay its signing for the time being.

The meeting with Hitler precipitated a visit to Bulgaria by the Soviet diplomat Arkady Sobolev on 25 November. He encouraged the Bulgarians to sign a mutual assistance pact that had first been discussed in October 1939. He offered Soviet recognition of Bulgarian claims in Greece and Turkey. The Bulgarian government, however, was disturbed by the subversive actions of the Bulgarian Communist Party in response to the talks, apparently at the Soviets&#x27; urging.

On 26 December 1940, the far-right politician Alexander Tsankov introduced a motion in the National Assembly urging the government to accede to the Tripartite Pact immediately, but it was voted down.

Bulgaria&#x27;s hand was finally forced by Germany&#x27;s desire to intervene in the Italo-Greek War, which would require moving troops through Bulgaria. With no possibility of resisting Germany militarily, Prime Minister Bogdan Filov signed Bulgaria&#x27;s accession to the pact in Vienna on 1 March 1941. He announced that it was done partly in gratitude for Germany&#x27;s assistance to Bulgaria in obtaining the Treaty of Craiova with Romania and that it would not affect Bulgaria&#x27;s relations with Turkey or the Soviet Union. Later that day, Ribbentrop promised Filov that after the fall of Greece, Bulgaria would obtain an Aegean coastline between the Struma and Maritsa Rivers.

According to Article 17 of the Tarnovo Constitution, treaties had to be ratified by the National Assembly. In the case of the Tripartite Pact, the government sought to have the treaty ratified without debate or discussion. Seventeen opposition deputies submitted an interpellation and one, Ivan Petrov, asked why the National Assembly had not been consulted in advance and whether the pact involved Bulgaria in war. They were ignored. The pact was ratified by a vote of 140 to 20.

===Yugoslavia===

On 25 March 1941 in Vienna, Dragiša Cvetković, the prime minister of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, signed the Tripartite Pact. On 27 March, the regime was overthrown in a military &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; with British support. Seventeen-year-old King Peter II was declared to be of age. The new Yugoslav government under Prime Minister and General Dušan Simović, refused to ratify Yugoslavia&#x27;s signing of the Tripartite Pact and started negotiations with the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. The enraged Hitler issued Directive 25 as an answer to the coup and then attacked both Yugoslavia and Greece on 6 April. The German Air Force bombed Belgrade for three days and nights. German ground troops moved in, and Yugoslavia capitulated on 17 April.

===Independent State of Croatia===
The Independent State of Croatia (&quot;Nezavisna Država Hrvatska&quot;, or NDH), created from some former territories of the conquered Yugoslavia, signed the Tripartite Pact on 15 June 1941.

==Potential signatories==

===Soviet Union===

Just prior to the formation of the Tripartite Pact, the Soviet Union was informed of its existence and the potential of its joining. Vyacheslav Molotov was thus sent to Berlin to discuss the pact and the possibility of the Soviet Union joining. The Soviets considered joining the Tripartite Pact to be an update of existing agreements with Germany. During the visit to Berlin, Molotov agreed in principle to the Soviet Union joining the pact if some details, such as Soviet annexation of Finland, could be worked out. The Soviet government sent a revised version of the pact to Germany on 25 November. To demonstrate the benefits of partnership, the Soviet Union made large economic offerings to Germany.

However, the Germans had no intention of allowing the Soviets to join the pact; they were already making preparations for their invasion of the Soviet Union, and were committed to doing so regardless of any action taken by the Soviets:

When they received the Soviet proposal in November, they simply did not reply. They, however, accepted the new economic offerings and signed an agreement for them on 10 January 1941.

===Finland===

Military co-operation between Finland and Nazi Germany started in late 1940 after Finland had lost a significant amount of its territory to Soviet aggression during the Winter War. Finland joined Operation Barbarossa on 25 June 1941, which started the Continuation War. In November, Finland signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, an anticommunist agreement directed against the Soviet Union, with many other countries allied with Germany. Soon, Germany suggested for Finland to sign the Tripartite Pact, but the Finnish government refused since Finland saw its war as a &quot;separate war&quot; from the Second World War and saw its objectives as different from those of Nazi Germany. Finland also wanted to maintain diplomatic relations with the Allies, particularly the United States. During the Second World War, Germany asked Finland several times to sign the pact but the Finnish government declined all offers. Diplomatic relations between Finland and the United States were maintained until June 1944 although the US ambassador had already been recalled. The United Kingdom, however, declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941 in support of its ally, the Soviet Union.

At the request of the German command, the Finns established a winter warfare school in Kankaanpää. It began its first two-month course for German officers and NCOs in December 1941. In the summer of 1942, the German-speaking Finnish instructors taught a course on forest warfare. General Waldemar Erfurth, the German liaison to the Finnish general headquarters, considered the school an outstanding success. It was also attended by some Hungarian officers.

===Thailand===
Japan attacked Thailand at 02:00 local time on 8 December 1941. The Japanese ambassador, Teiji Tsubokami, told the Thai foreign minister, Direk Jayanama, that Japan wanted only permission for its troops to pass through Thailand to attack the British in Malaya and Burma. At 07:00, Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram (Phibun) held an emergency cabinet meeting in Bangkok, and soon, a ceasefire was ordered. Phibun then met with Tsubokami, who offered him four options: to conclude a defensive–offensive alliance with Japan, to join the Tripartite Pact, to co-operate in Japanese military operations, or to agree to the joint defence of Thailand. Military co-operation was chosen, and the Tripartite Pact was rejected.

According to the postwar memoirs of Direk Jayanama, Phibun planned to sign the pact later but was prevented by Direk&#x27;s opposition.

==Tripartite relations, 1940–1943==

The &quot;joint technical commissions&quot; required by the pact were established by an agreement of 20 December 1940. They were to consist of a general commission in each capital, consisting of the host&#x27;s foreign minister and the other two partners&#x27; ambassadors. Under the general commission were to be military and economic commissions. On 15 December 1941, the first meeting of all three commissions in one capital, Berlin, took place, labelled a &quot;Tripartite Pact Conference&quot;. It was decided there to form a &quot;Permanent Council of the Tripartite Pact Powers&quot;, but nothing happened for two months. Only the Italians, whom the Japanese mistrusted, pushed for greater collaboration.

On 18 January 1942, the German and Italian governments signed two secret operational agreements: one with the Imperial Japanese Army and another with the Imperial Japanese Navy. The agreements divided the world along longitude 70° east into two major operational zones, but it had almost no military significance. Chiefly, it committed the powers to co-operation in matters of commerce, intelligence and communication.

On 24 February 1942, the Permanent Council met under the chairmanship of Ribbentrop, who announced that &quot;the propaganda effect is one of the main reasons for our meetings&quot;. The representatives set up a propaganda commission and then adjourned indefinitely. The military commission in Berlin met only two or three times by 1943, and there were no trilateral naval talks at all. Germany and Japan conducted separate naval discussions, and Italy consulted the Japanese independently for its planned assault on Malta in 1942.

The economic relationship between the Tripartite powers was fraught with difficulty. Japan would not grant economic concessions to Germany in 1941 for fear of them ruining its negotiations with the United States. In January 1942, negotiations on economic co-operation began, but an agreement was not signed until 20 January 1943 in Berlin. Italy was invited to sign a similar agreement in Rome at the same time for propaganda purposes, but none of the supplementary Berlin protocols applied to Italo-Japanese relations.

==&quot;No separate peace&quot; agreement==
Japan first pressed Germany to join the war with the United States on 2 December 1941, only two days after notifying Berlin of its intention to go to war. Receiving no response, Japan approached Italy. At 04:00 on the morning of 5 December, Ribbentrop gave the Japanese ambassador a proposal, which had been approved by Italy, to join the war and to prosecute it jointly. On 11 December 1941, the same day as the German declaration of war against the United States and the Italian declaration, the three powers signed an agreement, already hammered out on 8 December, barring any separate peace with the United States or Britain. It was &quot;intended as a propaganda accompaniment to the declaration of war&quot;.
==Legacy==

As the defensive alliance under the pact was never invoked, and as the main signatories were widely separated between Europe and Asia limiting co-operation between the European and Asian signatories, the impact of the Pact was limited. The historian Paul W. Schroeder has described it as rapidly declining from a &quot;position of importance in late 1940 to one of merely nominal existence in late 1941&quot; and as &quot;virtually inoperative&quot; by December 1941.

Despite its limited practical impact, the Tripartite Pact had significant symbolic implications, particularly in influencing American perceptions. It persuaded the American public that Japan was acting in concert with Germany, which played into broader narratives of a coordinated Axis effort to dominate globally. On the other hand, the Pact persuaded the American people that Japan was acting in league with Germany. The charge that the Pact was part of an effort to co-ordinate aggression and achieve world domination also formed part of the case brought against the Nazi leaders at Nuremberg.

Similarly the Tokyo War Crimes Trials also focused on the establishing of mixed technical commissions between Germany, Japan, and Italy as evidence that the Pact began functioning shortly after it was signed, and showed mutual support in aggression under the pact, though these commissions never actually functioned.Moreover, the Pact&#x27;s ideological underpinnings, rooted in global fascism and the aggressive ambitions for a new world order by its signatories, underscored the broader Axis strategy against the Allies.

It contributed to the legal and moral frameworks within which the Axis powers&#x27; actions were judged post-war, highlighting the complex legacy of wartime alliances not just in terms of their immediate strategic impacts, but also in terms of their longer-term effects on international relations and legal precedents for addressing acts of aggression.

<doc id="48344" wikidata="Q164047" url="?curid=48344" title="Alexander Pope">
<text>Alexander Pope (21 May 1688 O.S. – 30 May 1744) was an English poet, translator, and satirist of the Enlightenment era who is considered one of the most prominent English poets of the early 18th century. An exponent of Augustan literature, Pope is best known for his satirical and discursive poetry including &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;, &quot;The Dunciad&quot;, and &quot;An Essay on Criticism,&quot; and for his translations of Homer.

Pope is often quoted in &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations&quot;, some of his verses having entered common parlance (e.g. &quot;damning with faint praise&quot; or &quot;to err is human; to forgive, divine&quot;).

==Life==
Alexander Pope was born in London on 21 May 1688 during the year of the Glorious Revolution. His father (Alexander Pope, 1646–1717) was a successful linen merchant in the Strand, London. His mother, Edith (née Turner, 1643–1733), was the daughter of William Turner, Esquire, of York. Both parents were Catholics. His uncle-in-law was the miniature painter Samuel Cooper, through his mother&#x27;s sister, Christiana. Pope&#x27;s education was affected by the recently enacted Test Acts, a series of English penal laws that upheld the status of the established Church of England, banning Catholics from teaching, attending a university, voting, and holding public office on penalty of perpetual imprisonment. Pope was taught to read by his aunt and attended Twyford School circa 1698. He also attended two Roman Catholic schools in London. Such schools, though still illegal, were tolerated in some areas.

In 1700 his family moved to a small estate at Popeswood, in Binfield, Berkshire, close to the royal Windsor Forest. This was due to strong anti-Catholic sentiment and a statute preventing &quot;Papists&quot; from living within of London or Westminster. Pope would later describe the countryside around the house in his poem &quot;Windsor Forest&quot;. Pope&#x27;s formal education ended at this time, and from then on, he mostly educated himself by reading the works of classical writers such as the satirists Horace and Juvenal, the epic poets Homer and Virgil, as well as English authors such as Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare and John Dryden. He studied many languages, reading works by French, Italian, Latin, and Greek poets. After five years of study, Pope came into contact with figures from London literary society such as William Congreve, Samuel Garth and William Trumbull.

At Binfield he made many important friends. One of them, John Caryll (the future dedicatee of &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;), was twenty years older than the poet and had made many acquaintances in the London literary world. He introduced the young Pope to the ageing playwright William Wycherley and to William Walsh, a minor poet, who helped Pope revise his first major work, &quot;The Pastorals&quot;. There, he met the Blount sisters, Teresa and Martha (Patty), in 1707. He remained close friends with Patty until his death, but his friendship with Teresa ended in 1722.

From the age of 12 he suffered numerous health problems, including Pott disease, a form of tuberculosis that affects the spine, which deformed his body and stunted his growth, leaving him with a severe hunchback. His tuberculosis infection caused other health problems including respiratory difficulties, high fevers, inflamed eyes and abdominal pain. He grew to a height of only . Pope was already removed from society as a Catholic, and his poor health alienated him further. Although he never married, he had many female friends to whom he wrote witty letters, including Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. It has been alleged that his lifelong friend Martha Blount was his lover. His friend William Cheselden said, according to Joseph Spence, &quot;I could give a more particular account of Mr. Pope&#x27;s health than perhaps any man. Cibber&#x27;s slander (of carnosity) is false. He had been gay [happy], but left that way of life upon his acquaintance with Mrs. B.&quot;

In May 1709, Pope&#x27;s &quot;Pastorals&quot; was published in the sixth part of bookseller Jacob Tonson&#x27;s &quot;Poetical Miscellanies&quot;. This earned Pope instant fame and was followed by &quot;An Essay on Criticism&quot;, published in May 1711, which was equally well received.

Around 1711, Pope made friends with Tory writers Jonathan Swift, Thomas Parnell and John Arbuthnot, who together formed the satirical Scriblerus Club. Its aim was to satirise ignorance and pedantry through the fictional scholar Martinus Scriblerus. He also made friends with Whig writers Joseph Addison and Richard Steele. In March 1713, &quot;Windsor Forest&quot; was published to great acclaim.

During Pope&#x27;s friendship with Joseph Addison, he contributed to Addison&#x27;s play &quot;Cato&quot;, as well as writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Spectator&quot;. Around this time, he began the work of translating the &quot;Iliad&quot;, which was a painstaking process – publication began in 1715 and did not end until 1720.

In 1714 the political situation worsened with the death of Queen Anne and the disputed succession between the Hanoverians and the Jacobites, leading to the Jacobite rising of 1715. Though Pope, as a Catholic, might have been expected to have supported the Jacobites because of his religious and political affiliations, according to Maynard Mack, &quot;where Pope himself stood on these matters can probably never be confidently known&quot;. These events led to an immediate downturn in the fortunes of the Tories, and Pope&#x27;s friend Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke, fled to France. This was added to by the Impeachment of the former Tory Chief Minister Lord Oxford. 

Pope lived in his parents&#x27; house in Mawson Row, Chiswick, between 1716 and 1719; the red-brick building is now the &quot;Mawson Arms&quot;, commemorating him with a blue plaque.

The money made from his translation of Homer allowed Pope to move in 1719 to a villa at Twickenham, where he created his now-famous grotto and gardens. The serendipitous discovery of a spring during the excavation of the subterranean retreat enabled it to be filled with the relaxing sound of trickling water, which would quietly echo around the chambers. Pope was said to have remarked, &quot;Were it to have nymphs as well – it would be complete in everything.&quot; Although the house and gardens have long since been demolished, much of the grotto survives beneath Radnor House Independent Co-educational School. The grotto has been restored and will open to the public for 30 weekends a year from 2023 under the auspices of Pope&#x27;s Grotto Preservation Trust.

==Poetry==
===&quot;Essay on Criticism&quot;===

&quot;An Essay on Criticism&quot; was first published anonymously on 15 May 1711. Pope began writing the poem early in his career and took about three years to finish it.

At the time the poem was published, its heroic couplet style was quite a new poetic form and Pope&#x27;s work an ambitious attempt to identify and refine his own positions as a poet and critic. It was said to be a response to an ongoing debate on the question of whether poetry should be natural, or written according to predetermined artificial rules inherited from the classical past.

The &quot;essay&quot; begins with a discussion of the standard rules that govern poetry, by which a critic passes judgement. Pope comments on the classical authors who dealt with such standards and the authority he believed should be accredited to them. He discusses the laws to which a critic should adhere while analysing poetry, pointing out the important function critics perform in aiding poets with their works, as opposed to simply attacking them. The final section of &quot;An Essay on Criticism&quot; discusses the moral qualities and virtues inherent in an ideal critic, whom Pope claims is also the ideal man.

===&quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;===
Pope&#x27;s most famous poem is &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;, first published in 1712, with a revised version in 1714. A mock-epic, it satirises a high-society quarrel between Arabella Fermor (the &quot;Belinda&quot; of the poem) and Lord Petre, who had snipped a lock of hair from her head without permission. The satirical style is tempered, however, by a genuine, almost voyeuristic interest in the &quot;beau-monde&quot; (fashionable world) of 18th-century society. The revised, extended version of the poem focuses more clearly on its true subject: the onset of acquisitive individualism and a society of conspicuous consumers. In the poem, purchased artefacts displace human agency and &quot;trivial things&quot; come to dominate.

===&quot;The Dunciad&quot; and &quot;Moral Essays&quot;===
Though &quot;The Dunciad&quot; first appeared anonymously in Dublin, its authorship was not in doubt. Pope pilloried a host of other &quot;hacks&quot;, &quot;scribblers&quot; and &quot;dunces&quot; in addition to Theobald, and Maynard Mack has accordingly called its publication &quot;in many ways the greatest act of folly in Pope&#x27;s life&quot;. Though a masterpiece due to having become &quot;one of the most challenging and distinctive works in the history of English poetry&quot;, writes Mack, &quot;it bore bitter fruit. It brought the poet in his own time the hostility of its victims and their sympathizers, who pursued him implacably from then on with a few damaging truths and a host of slanders and lies.&quot;

According to his half-sister Magdalen Rackett, some of Pope&#x27;s targets were so enraged by &quot;The Dunciad&quot; that they threatened him physically. &quot;My brother does not seem to know what fear is,&quot; she told Joseph Spence, explaining that Pope loved to walk alone, so went accompanied by his Great Dane Bounce, and for some time carried pistols in his pocket. This first &quot;Dunciad&quot;, along with John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; and Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, joined in a concerted propaganda assault against Robert Walpole&#x27;s Whig ministry and the financial revolution it stabilised. Although Pope was a keen participant in the stock and money markets, he never missed a chance to satirise the personal, social and political effects of the new scheme of things. From &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot; onwards, these satirical themes appear constantly in his work.

In 1731, Pope published his &quot;Epistle to Burlington&quot;, on the subject of architecture, the first of four poems later grouped as the &quot;Moral Essays&quot; (1731–1735). The epistle ridicules the bad taste of the aristocrat &quot;Timon&quot;. For example, the following are verses 99 and 100 of the Epistle:

Pope&#x27;s foes claimed he was attacking the Duke of Chandos and his estate, Cannons. Though the charge was untrue, it did much damage to Pope.

There has been some speculation on a feud between Pope and Thomas Hearne, due in part to the character of Wormius in &quot;The Dunciad&quot;, who is seemingly based on Hearne.

===&quot;An Essay on Man&quot;===

&quot;An Essay on Man&quot; is a philosophical poem in heroic couplets published between 1732 and 1734. Pope meant it as the centrepiece of a proposed system of ethics to be put forth in poetic form. It was a piece that he sought to make into a larger work, but he did not live to complete it. It
attempts to &quot;vindicate the ways of God to Man&quot;, a variation on Milton&#x27;s attempt in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; to &quot;justify the ways of God to Man&quot; (1.26). It challenges as prideful an anthropocentric worldview. The poem is not solely Christian, however. It assumes that man has fallen and must seek his own salvation.

Consisting of four epistles addressed to Lord Bolingbroke, it presents an idea of Pope&#x27;s view of the Universe: no matter how imperfect, complex, inscrutable and disturbing the Universe may be, it functions in a rational fashion according to natural laws, so that the Universe as a whole is a perfect work of God, though to humans it appears to be evil and imperfect in many ways. Pope ascribes this to our limited mindset and intellectual capacity. He argues that humans must accept their position in the &quot;Great Chain of Being&quot;, at a middle stage between the angels and the beasts of the world. Accomplish this and we potentially could lead happy and virtuous lives.

The poem is an affirmative statement of faith: life seems chaotic and confusing to man in the centre of it, but according to Pope it is truly divinely ordered. In Pope&#x27;s world, God exists and is what he centres the Universe around as an ordered structure. The limited intelligence of man can only take in tiny portions of this order and experience only partial truths, hence man must rely on hope, which then leads to faith. Man must be aware of his existence in the Universe and what he brings to it in terms of riches, power and fame. Pope proclaims that man&#x27;s duty is to strive to be good, regardless of other situations.

===Later life and works=== 

The &quot;Imitations of Horace&quot; that followed (1733–1738) were written in the popular Augustan form of an &quot;imitation&quot; of a classical poet, not so much a translation of his works as an updating with contemporary references. Pope used the model of Horace to satirise life under George II, especially what he saw as the widespread corruption tainting the country under Walpole&#x27;s influence and the poor quality of the court&#x27;s artistic taste. Pope added as an introduction to &quot;Imitations&quot; a wholly original poem that reviews his own literary career and includes famous portraits of Lord Hervey (&quot;Sporus&quot;), Thomas Hay, 9th Earl of Kinnoull (&quot;Balbus&quot;) and Addison (&quot;Atticus&quot;).

In 1738 came &quot;The Universal Prayer&quot;.

Among the younger poets whose work Pope admired was Joseph Thurston. After 1738, Pope himself wrote little. He toyed with the idea of composing a patriotic epic in blank verse called &quot;Brutus&quot;, but only the opening lines survive. His major work in those years was to revise and expand his masterpiece, &quot;The Dunciad&quot;. Book Four appeared in 1742 and a full revision of the whole poem the following year. Here Pope replaced the &quot;hero&quot; Lewis Theobald with the Poet Laureate, Colley Cibber as &quot;king of dunces&quot;. However, the real focus of the revised poem is Walpole and his works. By now Pope&#x27;s health, which had never been good, was failing. When told by his physician, on the morning of his death, that he was better, Pope replied: &quot;Here am I, dying of a hundred good symptoms.&quot; He died at his villa surrounded by friends on 30 May 1744, about eleven o&#x27;clock at night. On the previous day, 29 May 1744, Pope had called for a priest and received the Last Rites of the Catholic Church. He was buried in the nave of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Twickenham.

==Translations and editions==
===The &quot;Iliad&quot;===
Pope had been fascinated by Homer since childhood. In 1713, he announced plans to publish a translation of the &quot;Iliad&quot;. The work would be available by subscription, with one volume appearing every year over six years. Pope secured a revolutionary deal with the publisher Bernard Lintot, which earned him 200 guineas (£210) a volume, a vast sum at the time.

His &quot;Iliad&quot; translation appeared between 1715 and 1720. It was acclaimed by Samuel Johnson as &quot;a performance which no age or nation could hope to equal&quot;. Conversely, the classical scholar Richard Bentley wrote: &quot;It is a pretty poem, Mr. Pope, but you must not call it Homer.&quot;

===The &quot;Odyssey&quot;===
Encouraged by the success of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Bernard Lintot published Pope&#x27;s five-volume translation of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; in 1725–1726. For this Pope collaborated with William Broome and Elijah Fenton: Broome translated eight books (2, 6, 8, 11, 12, 16, 18, 23), Fenton four (1, 4, 19, 20) and Pope the remaining twelve. Broome provided the annotations. Pope tried to conceal the extent of the collaboration, but the secret leaked out. It did some damage to Pope&#x27;s reputation for a time, but not to his profits. Leslie Stephen considered Pope&#x27;s portion of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; inferior to his version of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, given that Pope had put more effort into the earlier work – to which, in any case, his style was better suited.

===Shakespeare&#x27;s works===
In this period, Pope was employed by the publisher Jacob Tonson to produce an opulent new edition of Shakespeare. When it appeared in 1725, it silently regularised Shakespeare&#x27;s metre and rewrote his verse in several places. Pope also removed about 1,560 lines of Shakespeare&#x27;s material, arguing that some appealed to him more than others. In 1726, the lawyer, poet and pantomime-deviser Lewis Theobald published a scathing pamphlet called &quot;Shakespeare Restored&quot;, which catalogued the errors in Pope&#x27;s work and suggested several revisions to the text. This enraged Pope, wherefore Theobald became the main target of Pope&#x27;s &quot;Dunciad&quot;.

The second edition of Pope&#x27;s &quot;Shakespeare&quot; appeared in 1728. Apart from some minor revisions to the preface, it seems that Pope had little to do with it. Most later 18th-century editors of Shakespeare dismissed Pope&#x27;s creatively motivated approach to textual criticism. Pope&#x27;s preface continued to be highly rated. It was suggested that Shakespeare&#x27;s texts were thoroughly contaminated by actors&#x27; interpolations and they would influence editors for most of the 18th century.

==Spirit, skill and satire==
Pope&#x27;s poetic career testifies to an indomitable spirit despite disadvantages of health and circumstance. The poet and his family were Catholics and so fell subject to the prohibitive Test Acts, which hampered their co-religionists after the abdication of James II. One of these banned them from living within ten miles of London, another from attending public school or university. So except for a few spurious Catholic schools, Pope was largely self-educated. He was taught to read by his aunt and became a book lover, reading in French, Italian, Latin and Greek and discovering Homer at the age of six. In 1700, when only twelve years of age, he wrote his poem &quot;Ode on Solitude&quot;. As a child Pope survived once being trampled by a cow, but when he was 12 he began struggling with tuberculosis of the spine (Pott disease), which restricted his growth, so that he was only tall as an adult. He also suffered from crippling headaches.

In the year 1709, Pope showcased his precocious metrical skill with the publication of &quot;Pastorals&quot;, his first major poems. They earned him instant fame. By the age of 23, he had written &quot;An Essay on Criticism&quot;, released in 1711. A kind of poetic manifesto in the vein of Horace&#x27;s &quot;Ars Poetica&quot;, it met with enthusiastic attention and won Pope a wider circle of prominent friends, notably Joseph Addison and Richard Steele, who had recently begun to collaborate on the influential &quot;The Spectator&quot;. The critic John Dennis, having found an ironic and veiled portrait of himself, was outraged by what he saw as the impudence of a younger author. Dennis hated Pope for the rest of his life, and save for a temporary reconciliation, dedicated his efforts to insulting him in print, to which Pope retaliated in kind, making Dennis the butt of much satire.

A folio containing a collection of his poems appeared in 1717, along with two new ones about the passion of love: &quot;Verses to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady&quot; and the famous proto-romantic poem &quot;Eloisa to Abelard&quot;. Though Pope never married, about this time he became strongly attached to Lady M. Montagu, whom he indirectly referenced in his popular &quot;Eloisa to Abelard&quot;, and to Martha Blount, with whom his friendship continued through his life.

As a satirist, Pope made his share of enemies as critics, politicians and certain other prominent figures felt the sting of his sharp-witted satires. Some were so virulent that Pope even carried pistols while walking his dog. In 1738 and thenceforth, Pope composed relatively little. He began having ideas for a patriotic epic in blank verse titled &quot;Brutus&quot;, but mainly revised and expanded his &quot;Dunciad&quot;. Book Four appeared in 1742; and a complete revision of the whole in the year that followed. At this time Lewis Theobald was replaced with the Poet Laureate Colley Cibber as &quot;king of dunces&quot;, but his real target remained the Whig politician Robert Walpole.

==Reception==
By the mid-18th century, new fashions in poetry emerged. A decade after Pope&#x27;s death, Joseph Warton claimed that Pope&#x27;s style was not the most excellent form of the art. The Romantic movement that rose to prominence in early 19th-century England was more ambivalent about his work. Though Lord Byron identified Pope as one of his chief influences – believing his own scathing satire of contemporary English literature &quot;English Bards and Scotch Reviewers&quot; to be a continuance of Pope&#x27;s tradition – William Wordsworth found Pope&#x27;s style too decadent to represent the human condition. George Gilfillan in an 1856 study called Pope&#x27;s talent &quot;a rose peering into the summer air, fine, rather than powerful&quot;.

Pope&#x27;s reputation revived in the 20th century. His work was full of references to the people and places of his time, which aided people&#x27;s understanding of the past. The post-war period stressed the power of Pope&#x27;s poetry, recognising that Pope&#x27;s immersion in Christian and Biblical culture lent depth to his poetry. For example, Maynard Mack, in the late 20th-century, argued that Pope&#x27;s moral vision demanded as much respect as his technical excellence. Between 1953 and 1967 the definitive Twickenham edition of Pope&#x27;s poems appeared in ten volumes, including an index volume.

<doc id="48351" wikidata="Q128746" url="?curid=48351" title="Irving Berlin">
<text>Irving Berlin (born Israel Isidore Beilin; ; May 11, 1888 – September 22, 1989) was an American composer and songwriter. His music forms a large part of the Great American Songbook. Berlin received numerous honors including an Academy Award, a Grammy Award, and a Tony Award. He also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Gerald R. Ford in 1977. Broadcast journalist Walter Cronkite stated he &quot;helped write the story of this country, capturing the best of who we are and the dreams that shape our lives&quot;.

Born in Imperial Russia, Berlin arrived in the United States at the age of five. He published his first song, &quot;Marie from Sunny Italy&quot;, in 1907, receiving 33 cents for the publishing rights, and became known as the composer of numerous international hits, starting with 1911&#x27;s &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;. He also was an owner of the Music Box Theatre on Broadway. For much of his career, Berlin could not read sheet music, and was such a limited piano player that he could only play in the key of F-sharp; he used his custom piano equipped with a transposing lever when he needed to play in keys other than F-sharp. He was known for writing music and lyrics in the American vernacular: uncomplicated, simple and direct, with his stated aim being to &quot;reach the heart of the average American,&quot; who he saw as the &quot;real soul of the country&quot;.

He wrote hundreds of songs, many becoming major hits, which made him famous before he turned thirty. During his 60-year career he wrote an estimated 1,500 songs, including the scores for 20 original Broadway shows and 15 original Hollywood films, with his songs nominated eight times for Academy Awards. Many songs became popular themes and anthems, including &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;, &quot;Blue Skies&quot;, &quot;Easter Parade&quot;, &quot;Puttin&#x27; on the Ritz&quot;, &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot;, &quot;White Christmas&quot;, &quot;Happy Holiday&quot;, &quot;Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)&quot;, and &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot;. 
His Broadway musical &quot;This Is the Army&quot; (1942) was adapted into the 1943 film of the same name.

Berlin&#x27;s songs have reached the top of the US charts 25 times and have been extensively re-recorded by numerous singers. Berlin died in 1989 at the age of 101. Composer Douglas Moore sets Berlin apart from all other contemporary songwriters, and includes him instead with Stephen Foster, Walt Whitman, and Carl Sandburg, as a &quot;great American minstrel&quot;—someone who has &quot;caught and immortalized in his songs what we say, what we think about, and what we believe.&quot; Composer George Gershwin called him &quot;the greatest songwriter that has ever lived&quot;, and composer Jerome Kern concluded that &quot;Irving Berlin has no &quot;place&quot; in American music—he &quot;is&quot; American music.&quot;

==Early life==

===Jewish immigrant===

====Life in Russia====
Berlin was born Israel Beilin on May 11, 1888, in the Russian Empire. Although his family came from the &quot;shtetl&quot; of Tolochin (; today Talachyn, , in Belarus), Berlin later learned that he was probably born in Tyumen, Siberia, where his father, an itinerant cantor, had taken his family. He was one of eight children of Moses (1848–1901) and Lena Lipkin Beilin (1850–1922).

From Tyumen, the family returned to Tolochin, and from there, they travelled to Antwerp and left the old continent aboard the SS &quot;Rhynland&quot; from the Red Star Line. On September 14, 1893, the family arrived at Ellis Island in New York City. When they arrived, Israel was put in a pen with his brother and five sisters until immigration officials declared them fit to be allowed into the city. After the family&#x27;s naturalization, the name &quot;Beilin&quot; was changed to &quot;Baline&quot;.

According to biographer Laurence Bergreen, as an adult Berlin admitted to no memories of his first five years in Russia except for one: &quot;he was lying on a blanket by the side of a road, watching his house burn to the ground. By daylight the house was in ashes.&quot; As an adult, Berlin said he was unaware of being raised in abject poverty since he had known no other life.

The Berlins were one of hundreds of thousands of Jewish families who emigrated to the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century, escaping discrimination, poverty and brutal pogroms. Other such families included those of George and Ira Gershwin, Al Jolson, Sophie Tucker, L. Wolfe Gilbert, Jack Yellen, Louis B. Mayer (of MGM), and the Warner brothers.

====Settling in New York City====

After their arrival in New York City, the Baline family lived briefly in a basement flat on Monroe Street, and then moved to a three-room tenement at 330 Cherry Street. His father, unable to find comparable work as a cantor in New York, took a job at a kosher meat market and gave Hebrew lessons on the side to support his family. He died a few years later when Irving was thirteen years old.

With only a few years of schooling, eight-year-old Irving began helping to support his family. He became a newspaper boy, hawking &quot;The Evening Journal.&quot; One day while delivering newspapers, according to Berlin&#x27;s biographer and friend, Alexander Woollcott, he stopped to look at a ship departing for China and became so entranced that he did not see a swinging crane, which knocked him into the river. When he was fished out after going down for the third time, he was still holding in his clenched fist the five pennies he earned that day.

His mother took a job as a midwife, and three of his sisters worked wrapping cigars, common for immigrant girls. His older brother worked in a sweatshop assembling shirts. Each evening, when the family came home from their day&#x27;s work, Bergreen writes, &quot;they would deposit the coins they had earned that day into Lena&#x27;s outspread apron.&quot; 

Music historian Philip Furia writes that when &quot;Izzy&quot; began to sell newspapers in the Bowery, he was exposed to the music and sounds coming from saloons and restaurants that lined the crowded streets. Young Berlin sang some of the songs he heard while selling papers, and people would toss him some coins. He confessed to his mother one evening that his newest ambition in life was to become a singing waiter in a saloon. From this he stepped up to work as a song plugger and singing waiter in cafes and restaurants in the downtown areas of New York City. His first lyric, written with a café pianist, earned him a royalty of thirty-seven cents.

However, before Berlin was fourteen his meager income was still adding less than his sisters&#x27; to the family&#x27;s budget, which made him feel worthless. He then decided to leave home and join the city&#x27;s ragged army of other young immigrants. He lived in the Bowery, taking up residence in one of the lodging houses that sheltered the thousands of other homeless boys in the Lower East Side. Bergreen describes them as being uncharitable living quarters, &quot;Dickensian in their meanness, filth, and insensitivity to ordinary human beings.&quot;

===Early jobs===

Having left school around the age of thirteen, Berlin had few survival skills and realized that formal employment was out of the question. His only ability was acquired from his father&#x27;s vocation as a singer, and he joined with several other youngsters who went to saloons on the Bowery and sang to customers. Itinerant young singers like them were common on the Lower East Side. Berlin would sing a few of the popular ballads he heard on the street, hoping people would pitch him a few pennies. From these seamy surroundings, he became streetwise, with real and lasting education. Music was his only source of income, and he picked up the language and culture of the ghetto lifestyle.

Berlin learned what kind of songs appealed to audiences, writes Bergreen: &quot;well-known tunes expressing simple sentiments were the most reliable.&quot; He soon began plugging songs at Tony Pastor&#x27;s Music Hall in Union Square and, in 1906, when he was 18, got a job as a singing waiter at the Pelham Cafe in Chinatown. Besides serving drinks, he sang made-up &quot;blue&quot; parodies of hit songs to the delight of customers.

Biographer Charles Hamm writes that in Berlin&#x27;s free time after hours, he taught himself to play the piano. Never having had lessons, after the bar closed for the night, young Berlin would sit at a piano in the back and begin improvising tunes. He published his first song, &quot;Marie from Sunny Italy&quot;, written in collaboration with the Pelham&#x27;s resident pianist Mike Nicholson, in 1907, receiving 33 cents for the publishing rights. The sheet music to the published song presented his name as &quot;I. Berlin&quot;.

Berlin continued writing and playing music at Pelham Cafe and developing an early style. He liked the words to other people&#x27;s songs but sometimes the rhythms were &quot;kind of boggy,&quot; and he might change them. One night he delivered some hits composed by his friend George M. Cohan, another kid who was getting known on Broadway with his own songs. When Berlin ended with Cohan&#x27;s &quot;Yankee Doodle Boy&quot;, notes Whitcomb, &quot;everybody in the joint applauded the feisty little fellow.&quot;

===Recognition as songwriter===
Max Winslow (c. 1883–1942), a staff member at music publisher Harry Von Tilzer Company, noticed Berlin&#x27;s singing on many occasions and became so taken with his talent that he tried to get him a job with his firm. Von Tilzer said that Max claimed to have &quot;discovered a great kid&quot;, and raved about him so much that Von Tilzer hired Berlin.

In 1908, when he was 20, Berlin took a new job at a saloon named Jimmy Kelly&#x27;s in the Union Square neighborhood. There, he was able to collaborate with other young songwriters, such as Edgar Leslie, Ted Snyder, Al Piantadosi, and George A. Whiting. In 1909, the year of the premiere of Israel Zangwill&#x27;s &quot;The Melting Pot&quot;, he got another big break as a staff lyricist with the Ted Snyder Company.

Installed as a staff lyricist with a leading Tin Pan Alley music publishing house, Berlin quickly established himself as one of that frantic industry&#x27;s top writers of words to other composer&#x27;s melodies. By 1910 he was already in demand and even appeared in a Shubert Broadway revue performing his own songs. It was purely by chance that Berlin started composing music to the words of his songs. A lyric he had submitted to a publisher was thought to be complete with music. Not wishing to lose the sale, Berlin quickly wrote a melody. It was accepted and published. The success of this first effort opened the door to his career as a composer of music as well as lyrics. In 1910, Berlin wrote a hit that solidly established him as one of Tin Pan Alley&#x27;s leading composers. &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; not only popularized the vogue for &quot;ragtime&quot;, but later inspired a major motion picture.

==Songwriting career==
===Before 1920===
====&quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; (1911)====
Berlin rose as a songwriter in Tin Pan Alley and on Broadway. In 1911, Emma Carus introduced his first world-famous hit, &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;, followed by a performance from Berlin himself at the Friars&#x27; Frolic of 1911 with Clifford Hess as his accompanist. He became an instant celebrity, and the featured performer later that year at Oscar Hammerstein&#x27;s vaudeville house, where he introduced dozens of other songs. The &quot;New York Telegraph&quot; described how two hundred of his street friends came to see &quot;their boy&quot; onstage: &quot;All the little writer could do was to finger the buttons on his coat while tears ran down his cheeks—in a vaudeville house!&quot;

Richard Corliss, in a &quot;Time&quot; profile of Berlin, described &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; as a march, not a rag, &quot;its savviest musicality comprised quotes from a bugle call and &quot;Swanee River&quot;. The tune revived the ragtime fervor that Scott Joplin had begun a decade earlier, and made Berlin a songwriting star. From its first and subsequent releases, the song was near the top of the charts as others sang it: Bessie Smith, in 1927, and Louis Armstrong, in 1937; No. 1 by Bing Crosby and Connee Boswell; Johnny Mercer in 1945; Al Jolson, in 1947 and Nellie Lutcher in 1948. Add Ray Charles&#x27;s big-band version in 1959, and &quot;Alexander&quot; had a dozen hit versions in just under a half century.

Initially the song was not recognized as a hit, however; Broadway producer Jesse Lasky was uncertain about using it, although he did include it in his &quot;Follies&quot; show. It was performed as an instrumental but did not impress audiences, and was soon dropped from the show&#x27;s score. Berlin regarded it as a failure. He then wrote lyrics to the score, played it again in another Broadway review, and this time &quot;Variety&quot; news weekly called it &quot;the musical sensation of the decade&quot;. Composer George Gershwin, foreseeing its influence, said it was &quot;the first real American musical work&quot;, adding, &quot;Berlin had shown us the way; it was now easier to attain our ideal.&quot;

====Sparking a national dance craze====

Berlin was &quot;flabbergasted&quot; by the sudden international popularity of the song, and wondered why it became a sudden hit. He decided it was partly because the lyrics, &quot;silly though it was, was fundamentally right ... [and] the melody ... started the heels and shoulders of all America and a good section of Europe to rocking.&quot; In 1913, Berlin was featured in the London revue Hello Ragtime, where he introduced &quot;That International Rag&quot;, a song he had written for the occasion.

;&quot;Watch Your Step&quot;
Furia writes that the international success of &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; gave ragtime &quot;new life and sparked a national dance craze&quot;. Two dancers who expressed that craze were Vernon and Irene Castle. In 1914, Berlin wrote a ragtime revue, &quot;Watch Your Step&quot;, which starred the couple and showcased their talents on stage. That musical revue became Berlin&#x27;s first complete score with songs that &quot;radiated musical and lyrical sophistication&quot;. Berlin&#x27;s songs signified modernism, and they signified the cultural struggle between Victorian gentility and the &quot;purveyors of liberation, indulgence, and leisure&quot;, says Furia. The song &quot;Play a Simple Melody&quot; became the first of his famous &quot;double&quot; songs in which two different melodies and lyrics are counterpointed against one another.

&quot;Variety&quot; called &quot;Watch Your Step&quot; the &quot;first syncopated musical&quot;, where the &quot;sets and the girls were gorgeous&quot;. Berlin was then 26, and the success of the show was riding on his name alone. &quot;Variety&quot; said the show was a &quot;terrific hit&quot; from its opening night. It compared Berlin&#x27;s newfound status as a composer with that of the Times building: &quot;That youthful marvel of syncopated melody is proving things in &quot;Watch Your Step&quot;, firstly that he is not alone a rag composer, and that he is one of the greatest lyric writers America has ever produced.&quot;

Whitcomb also points out the irony that Russia, the country Berlin&#x27;s family was forced to leave, flung itself into &quot;the ragtime beat with an abandon bordering on mania&quot;. For example, Prince Felix Yusupov, a recent Oxford undergraduate of Russian noble lineage and heir to the largest estate in Russia, was described by his dance partner as &quot;wriggling around the ballroom like a demented worm, screaming for &#x27;more ragtime and more champagne.

====Simple and romantic ballads====

Some of the songs Berlin created came out of his own sadness. For instance, in 1912 he married Dorothy Goetz, the sister of songwriter E. Ray Goetz. She died six months later of typhoid fever contracted during their honeymoon in Havana. The song he wrote to express his grief, &quot;When I Lost You&quot;, was his first ballad. It was an immediate popular hit and sold more than a million copies.

He began to realize that ragtime was not a good musical style for serious romantic expression, and over the next few years adapted his style by writing more love songs. In 1915 he wrote the hit &quot;I Love a Piano&quot;, a comical and erotic ragtime love song.

By 1918 he had written hundreds of songs, mostly topical, which enjoyed brief popularity. Many of the songs were for the new dances then appearing, such as the grizzly bear, chicken walk, or foxtrot. After a Hawaiian dance craze began, he wrote &quot;That Hula-Hula&quot;, and then did a string of Southern songs, such as &quot;When the Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabam&quot;. During this period, he was creating a few new songs every week, including songs aimed at the various immigrant cultures arriving from Europe. On one occasion, Berlin, whose face was still not known, was on a train trip and decided to entertain the fellow passengers with some music. They asked him how he knew so many hit songs, and Berlin modestly replied, &quot;I wrote them.&quot;

An important song that Berlin wrote during his transition from writing ragtime to lyrical ballads was &quot;A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody&quot;, which became one of Berlin&#x27;s &quot;first big guns&quot;, says historian Alec Wilder. The song was written for Ziegfeld&#x27;s &quot;Follies of 1919&quot; and became the musical&#x27;s lead song. Its popularity was so great that it later became the theme for all of Ziegfeld&#x27;s revues, and the theme song in the 1936 film &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot;. Wilder puts it on the same level as Jerome Kern&#x27;s &quot;pure melodies&quot;, and in comparison with Berlin&#x27;s earlier music, says it is &quot;extraordinary that such a development in style and sophistication should have taken place in a single year&quot;.

====World War I====
On April 1, 1917, after President Woodrow Wilson declared that America would enter World War I, Berlin felt that Tin Pan Alley should do its duty and support the war with inspirational songs. Berlin wrote the song &quot;For Your Country and My Country&quot;, stating that &quot;we must speak with the sword not the pen to show our appreciation to America for opening up her heart and welcoming every immigrant group.&quot; He also co-wrote a song aimed at ending ethnic conflict, &quot;Let&#x27;s All Be Americans Now&quot;.

=====&quot;Yip Yip Yaphank&quot;=====
In 1917, Berlin was drafted into the United States Army, and his induction became headline news, with one paper headline reading, &quot;Army Takes Berlin!&quot; But the Army wanted Berlin, now aged 30, to do what he knew best: write songs. While stationed with the 152nd Depot Brigade at Camp Upton, he then composed an all-soldier musical revue titled &quot;Yip Yip Yaphank&quot;, written as a patriotic tribute to the United States Army. The show was taken to Broadway where it also included a number of hits, including &quot;Mandy&quot; and &quot;Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning&quot;, which Berlin performed himself.

The shows earned $150,000 for a camp service center. One song he wrote for the show but decided not to use, he would introduce 20 years later: &quot;God Bless America&quot;.

===1920 to 1940===

Berlin returned to Tin Pan Alley after the war and in 1921 created a partnership with Sam Harris to build the Music Box Theater. He maintained an interest in the theater throughout his life, and even in his last years was known to call the Shubert Organization, his partner, to check on the receipts. In its early years, the theater was a showcase for revues by Berlin. As theater owner, producer and composer, he looked after every detail of his shows, from the costumes and sets to the casting and musical arrangements.

According to Berlin biographer David Leopold, the theater, located at 239 West 45th St., was the only Broadway house built to accommodate the works of a songwriter. It was the home of Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Music Box Revue&quot; from 1921 to 1925 and &quot;As Thousands Cheer&quot; in 1933 and today includes an exhibition devoted to Berlin in the lobby.

====Various hit songs by Berlin====
By 1926, Berlin had written the scores to two editions of the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; and four annual editions of his &quot;Music Box Revue&quot;. These shows spanned the years of 1921–1926, premiering songs such as &quot;Say It With Music&quot;, &quot;Everybody Step&quot;, and &quot;Pack Up Your Things and Go to the Devil&quot;. &quot;Life&quot; magazine called Berlin the &quot;Lullaby Kid&quot;, noting that &quot;couples at country-club dances grew misty-eyed when the band went into &#x27;Always&#x27;, because they were positive that Berlin had written it just for them. When they quarreled and parted in the bitter-sweetness of the 1920s, it was Berlin who gave eloquence to their heartbreak by way of &#x27;What&#x27;ll I Do&#x27; and &#x27;Remember&#x27; and &#x27;All Alone&#x27;&quot;.

;&quot;What&#x27;ll I Do?&quot; (1924)
This ballad of love and longing was a hit record for Paul Whiteman and had several other successful recordings in 1924. Twenty-four years later, the song went to no. 22 for Nat King Cole and no. 23 for Frank Sinatra.

;&quot;Always&quot; (1925)
Written when he fell in love with Ellin Mackay, who later became his wife. The song became a hit twice (for Vincent Lopez and George Olsen) in its first incarnation. There were four more hit versions in 1944–45. In 1959, Sammy Turner took the song to no. 2 on the R&amp;B chart. It became Patsy Cline&#x27;s postmortem anthem and hit no. 18 on the country chart in 1980, 17 years after her death, and a tribute musical called &quot;Always... Patsy Cline&quot;, played a two-year Nashville run that ended in 1995. Leonard Cohen included a cover of this song on his 1992 release &quot;The Future (Leonard Cohen album)&quot;.

;&quot;Blue Skies&quot; (1926)
Written after his first daughter&#x27;s birth, he distilled his feelings about being married and a father for the first time: &quot;Blue days, all of them gone; nothing but blue skies, from now on.&quot; The American public often associated Irving Berlin’s music with Jewish cultural sensibility, when Berlin composed “Blue Skies”, the question of how a piece that resonated strongly with Jewish culture, became a strong representation of American musical culture came into light. Studying the early performances and its sheet music can help us understand how Jewish culture helped influence the pieces’ composition and popular reaction. Later interpretations transformed the songs’ ethnic and cultural connections. The song was introduced by Belle Baker in &quot;Betsy&quot;, a Ziegfeld production. It became a hit recording for Ben Selvin and one of several Berlin hits in 1927. It was performed by Al Jolson in the first feature sound film, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, that same year. In 1946, it returned to the top 10 on the charts with Count Basie and Benny Goodman. In 1978, Willie Nelson made the song a no. 1 country hit, 52 years after it was written.

;&quot;Puttin&#x27; On the Ritz&quot; (1928)
An instant standard with one of Berlin&#x27;s most &quot;intricately syncopated choruses&quot;, this song is associated with Fred Astaire, who sang and danced to it in the 1946 film &quot;Blue Skies&quot;. The song was written in 1928 with a separate set of lyrics and was introduced by Harry Richman in a 1930 film of the same name. In 1939, Clark Gable sang it in the movie &quot;Idiot&#x27;s Delight&quot;. In 1974 it was featured in the movie &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; by Mel Brooks, and was a no. 4 hit for synth-pop artist Taco in 1982, when its composer was 94. In 2012 it was used for a flash mob wedding event in Moscow.

;&quot;Marie&quot; (1929)
This waltz-time song was a hit for Rudy Vallée in 1929, and in 1937, updated to a four-quarter-time swing arrangement, was a top hit for Tommy Dorsey. It was on the charts at no. 13 in 1953 for The Four Tunes and at no. 15 for the Bachelors in 1965, 36 years after its first appearance.

;&quot;Say It Isn&#x27;t So&quot; (1932)
Rudy Vallée performed it on his radio show, and the song was a hit for George Olsen, Connee Boswell (she was still known as Connie), and Ozzie Nelson&#x27;s band. Aretha Franklin produced a single of the song in 1963, 31 years later. Furia notes that when Vallée first introduced the song on his radio show, the &quot;song not only became an overnight hit, it saved Vallée&#x27;s marriage: The Vallées had planned to get a divorce, but after Vallée sang Berlin&#x27;s romantic lyrics on the air, &quot;both he and his wife dissolved in tears&quot; and decided to stay together.

;&quot;I&#x27;ve Got My Love to Keep Me Warm&quot; (1937)
Performed by Dick Powell in the 1937 film &quot;On the Avenue&quot;. Later it had four top-12 versions, including by Billie Holiday and Les Brown, who took it to no. 1.

====&quot;God Bless America&quot; (1938)====


The song was written by Berlin twenty years earlier, but he filed it away until 1938 when Kate Smith needed a patriotic song to mark the 20th anniversary of Armistice Day, celebrating the end of World War I. Its release near the end of the Depression, which had by then gone on for nine years, enshrined a &quot;strain of official patriotism intertwined with a religious faith that runs deep in the American psyche,&quot; stated &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Berlin&#x27;s daughter, Mary Ellin Barrett, states that the song was actually &quot;very personal&quot; for her father, and was intended as an expression of his deep gratitude to the nation for merely &quot;allowing&quot; him, an immigrant raised in poverty, to become a successful songwriter. &quot;To me,&quot; said Berlin, &quot;&#x27;God Bless America&#x27; was not just a song but an expression of my feeling toward the country to which I owe what I have and what I am.&quot; The &quot;Economist&quot; magazine writes that &quot;Berlin was producing a deep-felt paean to the country that had given him what he would have said was everything.&quot;
It quickly became a second national anthem after America entered World War II a few years later. Over the decades it has earned millions for the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, to whom Berlin assigned all royalties. In 1954, Berlin received a special Congressional Gold Medal from President Dwight D. Eisenhower for contributing the song.

The song was heard after September 11, 2001, as U.S. senators and congressmen stood on the Capitol steps and sang it after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. It is often played by sports teams such as major league baseball. The Philadelphia Flyers hockey team started playing it before crucial contests. When the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team pulled off the &quot;greatest upset in sports history&quot;, referred to as the &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot;, the players spontaneously sang it as Americans were overcome by patriotism.

====Other songs====
Though most of his works for the Broadway stage took the form of revues—collections of songs with no unifying plot—he did write a number of book shows. &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; (1929) was a light comedy with a cast featuring, among others, the Marx Brothers. &quot;Face the Music&quot; (1932) was a political satire with a book by Moss Hart, and &quot;Louisiana Purchase&quot; (1940) was a satire of a Southern politician obviously based on the exploits of Huey Long. &quot;As Thousands Cheer&quot; (1933) was a revue, also with book by Moss Hart, with a theme: each number was presented as an item in a newspaper, some of them touching on issues of the day. The show yielded a succession of hit songs, including &quot;Easter Parade&quot; sung by Marilyn Miller and Clifton Webb, &quot;Heat Wave&quot; (presented as the weather forecast), &quot;Harlem on My Mind&quot;, and &quot;Supper Time&quot;, a song about racial violence inspired by a newspaper headline about a lynching, sung by Ethel Waters. She once said about the song, &quot;If one song can tell the whole tragic history of a race, &#x27;Supper Time&#x27; was that song. In singing it I was telling my comfortable, well-fed, well-dressed listeners about my people...those who had been slaves and those who were now downtrodden and oppressed.&quot;

===1941 to 1962===

====World War II patriotism—&quot;This is the Army&quot; (1943)====

Berlin loved his country, and wrote many songs reflecting his patriotism. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau requested a song to inspire Americans to buy war bonds, for which he wrote &quot;Any Bonds Today?&quot; He assigned all royalties to the United States Treasury Department. He then wrote songs for various government agencies and likewise assigned all profits to them: &quot;Angels of Mercy&quot; for the American Red Cross; &quot;Arms for the Love of America&quot;, for the U.S. Army Ordnance Department; and &quot;I Paid My Income Tax Today&quot;, again to Treasury.

When the United States joined World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Berlin immediately began composing a number of patriotic songs. His most notable and valuable contribution to the war effort was a stage show he wrote called &quot;This Is The Army&quot;. It was taken to Broadway and then on to Washington, D.C. (where President Franklin D. Roosevelt attended). It was eventually shown at military bases throughout the world, including London, North Africa, Italy, Middle East, and Pacific countries, sometimes in close proximity to battle zones. Berlin wrote nearly three dozen songs for the show which contained a cast of 300 men. He supervised the production and traveled with it, always singing &quot;Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning&quot;. The show kept him away from his family for three and a half years, during which time he took neither salary nor expenses, and turned over all profits to the Army Emergency Relief Fund.

The play was adapted into a movie of the same name in 1943, directed by Michael Curtiz, co-starring Joan Leslie and Ronald Reagan, who was then an army lieutenant. Kate Smith also sang &quot;God Bless America&quot; in the film with a backdrop showing families anxious over the coming war. The show became a hit movie and a morale-boosting road show that toured the battlefronts of Europe. The shows and movie combined raised more than $10 million for the Army, and in recognition of his contributions to troop morale, Berlin was awarded the Medal for Merit by President Harry S. Truman. Berlin&#x27;s daughter, Mary Ellin Barrett, who was 15 when she was at the opening-night performance of &quot;This is the Army&quot; on Broadway, remembered that when her father, who normally shunned the spotlight, appeared in the second act in soldier&#x27;s garb to sing &quot;Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning&quot;, he was greeted with a standing ovation that lasted 10 minutes. She adds that he was in his mid-50s at the time, and later declared those years with the show were the &quot;most thrilling time of his life&quot;.

====&quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; (1946)====
The grueling tours Berlin did performing &quot;This Is The Army&quot; left him exhausted, but when his longtime close friend Jerome Kern, who was the composer for &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, died suddenly, producers Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II persuaded Berlin to take over composing the score.

Loosely based on the life of sharpshooter Annie Oakley, the music and lyrics were written by Berlin, with a book by Herbert Fields and his sister Dorothy Fields, and directed by Joshua Logan. At first Berlin refused to take on the job, claiming that he knew nothing about &quot;hillbilly music&quot;, but the show ran for 1,147 performances and became his most successful score and biggest box office success. It is said that the showstopper song &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot; was almost left out of the show altogether because Berlin mistakenly thought that Rodgers and Hammerstein didn&#x27;t like it. However, it became the &quot;ultimate uptempo show tune&quot;.

On the origin of another of the play&#x27;s leading songs, Logan described how he and Hammerstein privately discussed wanting another duet between Annie and Frank. Berlin overheard their conversation, and although the show was to go into rehearsal within days, he wrote the song &quot;Anything You Can Do&quot; a few hours later.

One reviewer commented about the play&#x27;s score, that &quot;its tough wisecracking lyrics are as tersely all-knowing as its melody, which is nailed down in brassy syncopated lines that have been copied—but never equaled in sheer melodic memorability—by hundreds of theater composers ever since.&quot; Singer and musicologist Susannah McCorkle writes that the score &quot;meant more to me than ever, now that I knew that he wrote it after a grueling world tour and years of separation from his wife and daughters.&quot; Historian and composer Alec Wilder says that the perfection of the score, when compared to his earlier works, was &quot;a profound shock&quot;.

Apparently the &quot;creative spurt&quot; in which Berlin turned out several songs for the score in a single weekend was an anomaly. According to his daughter, he usually &quot;sweated blood&quot; to write his songs. &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; is considered to be Berlin&#x27;s best musical theatre score not only because of the number of hits it contains, but because its songs successfully combine character and plot development. The song &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot; became &quot;Ethel Merman&#x27;s trademark&quot;.

====Final shows====
Berlin&#x27;s next show, &quot;Miss Liberty&quot; (1949), was disappointing, but &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; (1950), starring Ethel Merman as Sally Adams, a Washington, D.C., socialite, loosely based on the famous Washington hostess Perle Mesta, fared better, giving him his second-greatest success. Berlin made two attempts to write a musical about his friend, the colorful Addison Mizner, and Addison&#x27;s con-man brother Wilson. The first was the uncompleted &quot;The Last Resorts&quot; (1952); a manuscript of Act I is in the Library of Congress. &quot;Wise Guy&quot; (1956) was completed but never produced, although songs have been published and recorded on &quot;The Unsung Irving Berlin&quot; (1995). After a failed attempt at retirement, in 1962, at the age of 74, he returned to Broadway with &quot;Mr. President&quot;. Although it ran for eight months, (with the premiere attended by President John F. Kennedy), it was not one of his successful plays.

Afterwards, Berlin officially announced his retirement and spent his remaining years in New York. He did, however, write one new song, &quot;An Old-Fashioned Wedding&quot;, for the 1966 Broadway revival of &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; starring Ethel Merman. Though he lived 23 more years, this would be one of Berlin&#x27;s final published compositions.

Berlin maintained a low profile through the last decades of his life, almost never appearing in public after the late 1960s, even for events held in his honor. However, he continued to maintain control of his songs through his own music publishing company, which remained in operation for the rest of his life.

==Film scores==
===1920s–1950s===
In 1927, his song &quot;Blue Skies&quot; was featured in the first feature-length talkie, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, with Al Jolson. Later, movies such as &quot;Top Hat&quot; (1935) became the first of a series of distinctive film musicals by Berlin starring performers Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire, Judy Garland, Ginger Rogers, and Alice Faye. &quot;Top Hat&quot; featured a brand-new score, as did several more, including &quot;Follow the Fleet&quot; (1936), &quot;On the Avenue&quot; (1937), &quot;Carefree&quot; (1938), and &quot;Second Fiddle&quot; (1939). Starting with &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; (1938), he often blended new songs with existing ones from his catalog. He continued this process with the films &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; (1942), &quot;Blue Skies&quot; (1946) and &quot;Easter Parade&quot; (1948), with Judy Garland and Fred Astaire, and &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot; (1954).

====&quot;White Christmas&quot; (1942)====
The 1942 film &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; introduced &quot;White Christmas&quot;, one of the most recorded songs in history. First sung in the film by Bing Crosby (along with Marjorie Reynolds, whose voice was dubbed by Martha Mears), it stayed no. 1 on the pop and R&amp;B charts for 10 weeks, and went on to over 50 million records. Crosby&#x27;s version is the best-selling single of all time. Music critic Stephen Holden credits this partly to the fact that &quot;the song also evokes a primal nostalgia—a pure childlike longing for roots, home and childhood—that goes way beyond the greeting imagery.&quot;

Richard Corliss also notes that the song was even more significant having been released soon after America entered World War II: [it] &quot;connected with... GIs in their first winter away from home. To them it voiced the ache of separation and the wistfulness they felt for the girl back home, for the innocence of youth...&quot; Poet Carl Sandburg wrote, &quot;We have learned to be a little sad and a little lonesome without being sickly about it. This feeling is caught in the song of a thousand jukeboxes and tune whistled in streets and homes, &#x27;I&#x27;m Dreaming of a White Christmas&#x27;. When we sing that we don&#x27;t hate anybody. And there are things we love that we&#x27;re going to have sometimes if the breaks are not too bad against us. Way down under this latest hit of his, Irving Berlin catches us where we love peace.&quot;

&quot;White Christmas&quot; won Berlin the Academy Award for Best Music in an Original Song, one of seven Oscar nominations he received during his career. In subsequent years, it was re-recorded and became a top-10 seller for numerous artists: Frank Sinatra, Jo Stafford, Ernest Tubb, The Ravens and The Drifters. It would also be the last time a Berlin song went to no. 1 upon its release.

Berlin is the only Academy Award presenter and Academy Award winner to open the &quot;envelope&quot; and read his or her own name (for &quot;White Christmas&quot;). This result was so awkward for Berlin (since he had to present the Oscar to himself) that the academy changed the rules of protocol the following year to prevent this situation from arising again.

Talking about Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;White Christmas&quot;, composer–lyricist Garrison Hintz stated that although songwriting can be a complicated process, its final result should sound simple. Considering the fact that &quot;White Christmas&quot; has only eight sentences in the entire song, lyrically Mr. Berlin achieved all that was necessary to eventually sell over 100 million copies and capture the hearts of the American public at the same time.

==Songwriting methods==
According to Saul Bornstein (a.k.a. Sol Bourne, Saul Bourne), Berlin&#x27;s publishing company manager, &quot;It was a ritual for Berlin to write a complete song, words and music, every day.&quot; Berlin said that he &quot;did not believe in inspiration,&quot; and felt that although he might be gifted in certain areas, his most successful compositions were a &quot;result of work&quot;. He said that he did most of his work under pressure. He would typically begin writing after dinner and continue until 4 or 5 in the morning. &quot;Each day I would attend rehearsals&quot;, he said, &quot;and at night write another song and bring it down the next day.&quot;

Not always certain about his own writing abilities, he once asked a songwriter friend, Victor Herbert, whether he should study composition. &quot;You have a natural gift for words and music,&quot; Mr. Herbert told him. &quot;Learning theory might help you a little, but it could cramp your style.&quot; Berlin took his advice. Herbert later became a moving force behind the creation of ASCAP, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. In 1914, Berlin joined him as a charter member of the organization that has protected the royalties of composers and writers ever since. In 1920, Irving Berlin became a member of SACEM, the French Society of Authors, Composers, and Publishers.

In later years, Berlin emphasized his conviction, saying that &quot;it&#x27;s the lyrics that makes a song a hit, although the tune, of course, is what makes it last.&quot; He played almost entirely in the key of F-sharp so that he could stay on the black keys, and owned three transposing pianos so as to change keys by moving a lever. Though Berlin eventually learned how to produce written music, he never changed his method of dictating songs to a &quot;musical secretary&quot;.

As a result, Wilder says that many admirers of the music of Jerome Kern, Richard Rodgers and Cole Porter were unlikely to consider Berlin&#x27;s work in the same category because they forgot or never realized that Berlin wrote many popular tunes, such as &quot;Soft Lights and Sweet Music&quot;, &quot;Supper Time&quot;, and &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot;. Some are even more confused because he also wrote more romantic melodies, such as &quot;What&#x27;ll I Do?&quot; and &quot;Always&quot;. Wilder adds that &quot;in his lyrics as in his melodies, Berlin reveals a constant awareness of the world around him: the pulse of the times, the society in which his is functioning. There is nothing of the hothouse about his work, urban though it may be.&quot;

==Music styles==
Composer Jerome Kern recognized that the essence of Irving Berlin&#x27;s lyrics was his &quot;faith in the American vernacular&quot;, an influence so profound that his best-known songs &quot;seem indivisible from the country&#x27;s history and self-image&quot;. Kern, along with George Gershwin, Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein II and Cole Porter, brought together Afro-American, Latin American, rural pop, and European operetta.

Berlin, however, did not follow that method. Instead, says music critic Stephen Holden, Berlin&#x27;s songs were always simple, &quot;exquisitely crafted street songs whose diction feels so natural that one scarcely notices the craft...they seem to flow straight out of the rhythms and inflections of everyday speech.&quot; Berlin can be credited with helping develop Jazz music. Jeffrey Magee wrote how his song &quot;Everybody Step&quot; was credited by composers such as Gershwin as one of the most important songs for learning jazz music. Berlin achieved this by using varying rhythms, such as the conventional rag and blues rhythms, as well as bringing in references to African American music. It led composer George Gershwin to claim that he learned from Berlin that ragtime, which later became jazz, &quot;was the only musical idiom in existence that could aptly express America&quot;.

Among Berlin&#x27;s contemporaries was Cole Porter, whose music style was often considered more &quot;witty, sophisticated, [and] dirty,&quot; according to musicologist Susannah McCorkle. Of the five top songwriters, only Porter and Berlin wrote both their own words and music. However, she notes that Porter, unlike Berlin, was a Yale-educated and wealthy Midwesterner whose songs were not successful until he was in his thirties. She notes further that it was &quot;Berlin [who] got Porter the show that launched his career.&quot;

==Personal life==
===Marriages=== 

In February 1912, after a brief whirlwind courtship, he married 20-year-old Dorothy Goetz of Buffalo, New York, the sister of one of Berlin&#x27;s collaborators, E. Ray Goetz. During their honeymoon in Havana, she contracted typhoid fever, and doctors were unable to treat her illness when she returned to New York. She died July 17 of that year. Left with writer&#x27;s block for months after Goetz&#x27;s death, he eventually wrote his first ballad, &quot;When I Lost You&quot;, to express his grief.
Years later in the 1920s, he fell in love with young author and heiress Ellin Mackay. Because Berlin was Jewish and she was a Catholic of Irish descent, their life was followed in every possible detail by the press, which found the romance of an immigrant from the Lower East Side and a young heiress a good story. Mackay&#x27;s father, Clarence Mackay, the socially prominent head of the Postal Telegraph Cable Company, objected to their marriage.

They had met in 1924, and her father opposed the match from the start. He went so far as to send her off to Europe to find other suitors and forget Berlin. However, Berlin wooed her with letters and songs over the airwaves such as &quot;Remember&quot; and &quot;All Alone&quot;, and she wrote him daily. Biographer Philip Furia writes that newspapers rumored they were engaged before she returned from Europe, and some Broadway shows even performed skits of the &quot;lovelorn songwriter&quot;. After her return, she and Berlin were besieged by the press, which followed them everywhere. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that her father vowed that their marriage &quot;would only happen &#x27;over my dead body.&#x27;&quot; As a result, they decided to elope and were married in a simple civil ceremony at the Municipal Building away from media attention.

The wedding news made the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The marriage took her father by surprise, and he was stunned upon reading about it. The bride&#x27;s mother, however, who was at the time divorced from Mackay, wanted her daughter to follow the dictates of her own heart. Berlin had gone to her mother&#x27;s home before the wedding and had obtained her blessing.

There followed reports that the bride&#x27;s father disowned his daughter because of the marriage. In response, Berlin gave the rights to &quot;Always&quot;, a song still played at weddings, to her as a wedding present. Ellin was thereby guaranteed a steady income regardless of what might happen with the marriage. For nearly three years Mackay refused to speak to the Berlins, but they reconciled after the death of the Berlins&#x27; son, Irving Berlin Jr., on Christmas Day 1928, less than one month after he was born.

Their marriage remained a love affair and they were inseparable until she died in July 1988 at the age of 85. They had four children during their 63 years of marriage: Mary Ellin Barrett in 1926, Irving Berlin Jr., who died in infancy in 1928, Linda Louise Emmet in 1932, and Elizabeth Irving Peters in 1936.

===Lifestyle===
In 1916, in the earlier phase of Berlin&#x27;s career, producer and composer George M. Cohan, during a toast to the young Berlin at a Friar&#x27;s Club dinner in his honor, said, &quot;The thing I like about Irvie is that although he has moved up-town and made lots of money, it hasn&#x27;t turned his head. He hasn&#x27;t forgotten his friends, he doesn&#x27;t wear funny clothes, and you will find his watch and his handkerchief in his pockets, where they belong.&quot;
Furia says that throughout Berlin&#x27;s life he often returned on foot to his old neighborhoods in Union Square, Chinatown, and the Bowery. He never forgot those childhood years when he &quot;slept under tenement steps, ate scraps, and wore secondhand clothes,&quot; and described those years as hard but good. &quot;Every man should have a Lower East Side in his life,&quot; he said. He used to visit &quot;The Music Box Theater&quot;, which he founded and which still stands at 239 West 45th St. From 1947 to 1989, Berlin&#x27;s home in New York City was 17 Beekman Place.

George Frazier of &quot;Life&quot; magazine found Berlin to be &quot;intensely nervous&quot;, with a habit of tapping his listener with his index finger to emphasize a point, and continually pressing his hair down in back and &quot;picking up any stray crumbs left on a table after a meal&quot;. While listening, &quot;he leans forward tensely, with his hands clasped below his knees like a prizefighter waiting in his corner for the bell... For a man who has known so much glory&quot;, wrote Frazier, &quot;Berlin has somehow managed to retain the enthusiasm of a novice.&quot;

Berlin&#x27;s daughter wrote in her memoir that her father was a loving, if workaholic, family man who was &quot;basically an upbeat person, with down periods&quot;. In his final decades he retreated from public life. As such, he did not attend the televised Carnegie Hall celebration of his 100th birthday. Her parents liked to celebrate every single holiday with their children, and &quot;[t]hey seemed to understand the importance, particularly in childhood, of the special day, the same every year, the special stories, foods, and decorations and that special sense of well-being that accompanies a holiday.&quot; Although he did comment to his daughter about her mother&#x27;s lavish Christmas spending, he remarked, &quot;I gave up trying to get your mother to economize. It was easier just to make more money.&quot;

Berlin voted for both Democratic and Republican presidential candidates. He supported the presidential candidacy of General Dwight Eisenhower, and his song &quot;I Like Ike&quot; featured prominently in the Eisenhower campaign. In his later years he also became more conservative in his views on music. According to his daughter, &quot;He was consumed by patriotism.&quot; He often said, &quot;I owe all my success to my adopted country&quot; and once rejected his lawyers&#x27; advice of investing in tax shelters, insisting, &quot;I &quot;want&quot; to pay taxes. I love this country.&quot;

Berlin was a Freemason, and was a member of Munn Lodge no. 190, New York City, the Scottish Rite Valley of New York City, and Mecca Shrine Temple.

Berlin was a noted member of The Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks.

Berlin was a staunch advocate of civil rights. He was honored in 1944 by the National Conference of Christians and Jews for &quot;advancing the aims of the conference to eliminate religious and racial conflict&quot;. His 1943 production &quot;This Is The Army&quot; featured the first integrated division army unit in the United States. In 1949, the Young Men&#x27;s Hebrew Association (YMHA) honored him as one of the twelve &quot;most outstanding Americans of Jewish faith&quot;. While he was ethnically and culturally Jewish, he was religiously agnostic. Berlin&#x27;s Civil Rights Movement support also made him a target of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who continuously investigated him for years.

==Death==

Berlin died in his sleep at his 17 Beekman Place town house in Manhattan on September 22, 1989, at the age of 101, of a heart attack and other natural causes. He was interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York.

On the evening following the announcement of his death, the marquee lights of Broadway playhouses were dimmed before curtain time in his memory. President George H. W. Bush said Berlin was &quot;a legendary man whose words and music will help define the history of our nation&quot;. Just minutes before his statement was released, the President joined a crowd of thousands to sing Berlin&#x27;s &quot;God Bless America&quot; at a luncheon in Boston. Former President Ronald Reagan, who costarred in Berlin&#x27;s 1943 musical &quot;This Is the Army,&quot; said, &quot;Nancy and I are deeply saddened by the death of a wonderfully talented man whose musical genius delighted and stirred millions and will live on forever.&quot;

Morton Gould, the composer and conductor who was president of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), of which Berlin was a founder, said, &quot;What to me is fascinating about this unique genius is that he touched so many people in so many age groups over so many years. He sounded our deepest feelings—happiness, sadness, celebration, loneliness.&quot; Ginger Rogers, who danced to Berlin tunes with Fred Astaire, told The Associated Press upon hearing of Berlin&#x27;s death that working with him had been &quot;like heaven&quot;.

==Legacy and influence==
&quot;The New York Times&quot;, after his death in 1989, wrote, &quot;Irving Berlin set the tone and the tempo for the tunes America played and sang and danced to for much of the 20th century.&quot; His life as an immigrant from Russia became the &quot;classic rags-to-riches story that he never forgot could have happened only in America&quot;. A legend by the time he turned 30, he went on to write an estimated 1,500 songs during his career. He composed the scores for 20 original Broadway shows and 15 original Hollywood films, with his songs nominated for Academy Awards on eight occasions. Music historian Susannah McCorkle writes that &quot;in scope, quantity, and quality his work was amazing.&quot; Others, such as Broadway musician Anne Phillips, called him &quot;an American institution.&quot;

During his six-decade career, from 1907 to 1966, he produced sheet music, Broadway shows, recordings, and scores played on radio, in films and on television, and his tunes continue to evoke powerful emotions for millions around the world. He wrote songs like &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;, &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot;, &quot;Blue Skies&quot; and &quot;Puttin&#x27; On the Ritz&quot;. Some of his songs have become holiday anthems, such as &quot;Easter Parade&quot;, &quot;White Christmas&quot; and &quot;Happy Holiday&quot;. &quot;White Christmas&quot; alone sold over 50 million records, the top-selling song in recording history. It won an ASCAP and an Academy Award, and is one of the most frequently played songs ever written.

In 1938, &quot;God Bless America&quot; became the unofficial national anthem of the United States, and on September 11, 2001, members of the House of Representatives stood on the steps of the Capitol and solemnly sang &quot;God Bless America&quot; together. The song again became popular shortly after 9/11, when Celine Dion recorded it as the title track of a 9/11 benefit album. The following year, the Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp of Berlin. By then, the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of New York had received more than $10 million in royalties from &quot;God Bless America&quot; as a result of Berlin&#x27;s donation of royalties. According to music historian Gary Giddins, &quot;No other songwriter has written as many anthems... No one else has written as many pop songs, period... [H]is gift for economy, directness, and slang, presents Berlin as an obsessive, often despairing commentator on the passing scene.&quot;

In 1934, &quot;Time&quot; put him on its cover and inside hailed &quot;this itinerant son of a Russian cantor&quot; as &quot;an American institution&quot;. And again, in 1943, the same magazine described his songs as follows:

They possess a permanence not generally associated with Tin Pan Alley products and it is more than remotely possible that in days to come Berlin will be looked upon as the Stephen Foster of the 20th century.

At various times, his songs were also rallying cries for different causes: He produced musical editorials supporting Al Smith and Dwight Eisenhower as presidential candidates, he wrote songs opposing Prohibition, defending the gold standard, calming the wounds of the Great Depression, and helping the war against Hitler, and in 1950 he wrote an anthem for the state of Israel. Biographer David Leopold adds that &quot;We all know his songs... they are all part of who we are.&quot;

Berlin inadvertently influenced American law when his publishing group sued &quot;Mad Magazine&quot; for copyright infringement in 1961. The humor magazine had published a collection of parody lyrics which it said could be &quot;sung to the tune of&quot; many popular songs. Berlin objected, and &quot;Irving Berlin et al. v. E.C. Publications, Inc.&quot; would ultimately become a landmark case. &quot;Mad&quot; prevailed at every stage. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled largely in favor of &quot;Mad&quot; in 1963, but Judge Charles Metzner decided that two of the 25 disputed parodies - &quot;Always&quot; (sung to the tune of &quot;Always&quot;) and &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like No Business&quot; (sung to the tune of &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot;) - would require a trial because they relied on the same verbal hooks (&quot;always&quot; and &quot;business&quot;) as the originals.

The music publishers pressed on. The following year, the U.S. Court of Appeals not only upheld the pro-&quot;Mad&quot; decision in regard to the 23 songs, it adopted an approach that was broad enough to strip the publishers of their limited victory regarding the remaining two songs. Writing a unanimous opinion for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Circuit Judge Irving Kaufman observed, &quot;We doubt that even so eminent a composer as plaintiff Irving Berlin should be permitted to claim a property interest in iambic pentameter.&quot; The publishers again appealed, but the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal, allowing the decision to stand. The precedent-setting 1964 ruling established the rights of parodists and satirists to mimic the meter of popular songs.

At his 100th-birthday celebration in May 1988, violinist Isaac Stern said, &quot;The career of Irving Berlin and American music were intertwined forever—American music was born at his piano,&quot; while songwriter Sammy Cahn pointed out: &quot;If a man, in a lifetime of 50 years, can point to six songs that are immediately identifiable, he has achieved something. Irving Berlin can sing 60 that are immediately identifiable... [Y]ou couldn&#x27;t have a holiday without his permission.&quot; Composer Douglas Moore added:

It&#x27;s a rare gift which sets Irving Berlin apart from all other contemporary songwriters. It is a gift which qualifies him, along with Stephen Foster, Walt Whitman, Vachel Lindsay and Carl Sandburg, as a great American minstrel. He has caught and immortalized in his songs what we say, what we think about, and what we believe.

ASCAP&#x27;s records show that 25 of Berlin&#x27;s songs reached the top of the charts and were re-recorded by dozens of famous singers over the years, such as Eddie Fisher, Al Jolson, Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Linda Ronstadt, Rosemary Clooney, Doris Day, Diana Ross, Nat King Cole and Ella Fitzgerald. In 1924, when Berlin was 36, his biography, &quot;The Story of Irving Berlin&quot;, was being written by Alexander Woollcott. In a letter to Woollcott, Jerome Kern offered what one writer said &quot;may be the last word&quot; on the significance of Irving Berlin:

Irving Berlin has no &quot;place&quot; in American music—he &quot;is&quot; American music. Emotionally, he honestly absorbs the vibrations emanating from the people, manners and life of his time and, in turn, gives these impressions back to the world—simplified, clarified and glorified.

Composer George Gershwin (1898–1937) also tried to describe the importance of Berlin&#x27;s compositions:

I want to say at once that I frankly believe that Irving Berlin is the greatest songwriter that has ever lived... His songs are exquisite cameos of perfection, and each one of them is as beautiful as its neighbor. Irving Berlin remains, I think, America&#x27;s Schubert. But apart from his genuine talent for song-writing, Irving Berlin has had a greater influence upon American music than any other one man. It was Irving Berlin who was the very first to have created a real, inherent American music... Irving Berlin was the first to free the American song from the nauseating sentimentality which had previously characterized it, and by introducing and perfecting ragtime he had actually given us the first germ of an American musical idiom; he had sown the first seeds of an American music.

<text>Joseph Pujol (June 1, 1857 – August 8, 1945), better known by his stage name Le Pétomane (, ), was a French flatulist (professional fartist) and entertainer. He was famous for his remarkable control of the abdominal muscles, which enabled him to seemingly fart at will. His stage name combines the French verb &quot;péter&quot;, &quot;to fart&quot; with the -&quot;mane&quot;, &quot;-maniac&quot; suffix, which translates to &quot;fartomaniac&quot;. The profession is referred to as &quot;flatulist&quot;, &quot;farteur&quot;, or &quot;fartiste&quot;.

It was a common misconception that Pujol passed intestinal gas as part of his stage performance. Rather, he was allegedly able to &quot;inhale&quot; or move air into his rectum and then control the release of that air with his anal sphincter muscles. Evidence of his ability to control those muscles was seen in the early accounts of demonstrations of his abilities to fellow soldiers.

==Life and career==

Joseph Pujol was born in Marseille, one of five children of stonemason and sculptor François Pujol and his wife Rose, in a family of Catalan origin. Soon after he left school, he had a strange experience while swimming in the sea. He put his head under the water and held his breath, whereupon he felt an icy cold penetrating his rear. He ran ashore in fright and was amazed to sense water pouring from his anus.

While serving in the army, he told his fellow soldiers about his special ability, and repeated it for their amusement, sucking up water from a pan into his rectum and then projecting it up to several yards. He found that he could suck in air as well. A trained baker, Pujol would sometimes entertain his customers by imitating musical instruments and claiming to be playing them behind the counter. Pujol decided to try the stage, and debuted in Marseilles in 1887. When his act was well received, he moved to Paris, where he appeared at the Moulin Rouge in 1892.

Some of the highlights of his stage act involved sound effects of cannon fire and thunderstorms, as well as playing &quot;&#x27;O Sole Mio&quot; and &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; on an ocarina through a rubber tube in his anus. He could also blow out a candle from several yards away. His audience included Edward, Prince of Wales, King Leopold II of the Belgians, and Sigmund Freud.

In 1894, the managers of the Moulin Rouge sued Pujol for an impromptu exhibition he gave to aid a friend struggling with economic difficulties. Pujol was fined 3,000 francs (equivalent to Ff in 2022), and the Moulin Rouge lost their star attraction as the disagreement led him to set up his own travelling show called the Theatre Pompadour.

In the following decade Pujol tried to &#x27;refine&#x27; and make his acts &#x27;gentler&#x27;; one of his favourite numbers became a rhyme about a farm which he himself composed, and which he punctuated with anal renditions of the animals&#x27; sounds.

With the outbreak of World War I, Pujol retired from the stage and returned to his bakery in Marseilles. Later he opened a biscuit factory in Toulon. He died in 1945, aged 88, and was buried in the cemetery of La Valette-du-Var, where his grave can still be seen today.

==Legacy==

Le Pétomane left an enduring legacy and has inspired a number of artistic works. These include several musicals based on his life, such as &quot;The Fartiste&quot; (awarded Best Musical at the 2006 New York International Fringe Festival) and Seth Rozin&#x27;s &quot;A Passing Wind&quot; which was premiered at the Philadelphia International Festival of the Arts in 2011. In addition, Le Pétomane was added to David Lee&#x27;s 2007 reworked revival of the 1953 Broadway play &quot;Can-Can&quot;, which had originally been written by Abe Burroughs and Cole Porter. The updated play, staged at the Pasadena Playhouse, featured musical theatre actor Robert Yacko as the fartiste, with sound effects provided by the band&#x27;s trombone and piccolo players.

The character has been portrayed several times in film. In 1979 Ian MacNaughton made a short humorous film, written by Galton and Simpson called &quot;Le Pétomane&quot;, based on Joseph Pujol&#x27;s story and starring veteran comic actor Leonard Rossiter. The 1983 Italian movie &quot;Il Petomane&quot;, directed by Pasquale Festa Campanile and starring Ugo Tognazzi, gives a poetic rendition of the character, contrasting his deep longing for normality with the condition of &#x27;freak&#x27; to which his act relegated him. The 1998 documentary &quot;Le Pétomane&quot; by Igor Vamos examines Joseph Pujol&#x27;s place in history through archival films (none of which actually include him), historical documents, photographs, recreations and fake or tongue-in-cheek interviews.

Le Pétomane is also referenced in &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, a 1974 satirical Western comedy film directed by Mel Brooks. Brooks appears in multiple supporting roles, including the dim-witted Governor William J. Le Petomane, whose name suggests he is full of hot air.

&#x27;Le Petoman&#x27; (without the , because English-speaking audiences will pronounce differently from ) was adapted for the theatre in 2001 by Tony Stowers, from the book &#x27;Le Petomane 1857–1945&#x27; by J. Nohain &amp; F. Caradec. It was turned down by Hull Truck, Salisbury Playhouse and the National Theatre in the UK on the grounds that they felt their audiences would be &#x27;too sophisticated&#x27; for the subject matter. It was read in English in Newcastle upon Tyne in 2005, in Paris in 2010, and in Nantes (in French); in June 2023 he finally made it to the stage with amateur actors.

<text>Leonard Rossiter (21 October 1926 – 5 October 1984) was an English actor. He had a long career in the theatre but achieved his highest profile for his television comedy roles starring as Rupert Rigsby in the ITV series &quot;Rising Damp&quot; from 1974 to 1978, and Reginald Perrin in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot; from 1976 to 1979.

==Early life and stage work==
Rossiter was born on 21 October 1926 in Wavertree, Liverpool, the second son of John and Elizabeth (née Howell) Rossiter. The family lived over the barber&#x27;s shop owned by his father. He was educated at the Liverpool Collegiate School (1939–46). In September 1939, when the Second World War began, Rossiter was an evacuee, along with his schoolmates, and went to Bangor in north Wales, where he stayed for 18 months. While at school, his ambition was to go to university to read modern languages and become a teacher; however, his father, who served as a voluntary ambulanceman during the war, was killed in the May Blitz air raid in 1941. Rossiter then had to support his mother, therefore he could not take up the place he had been offered at the University of Liverpool. Instead, he completed his National Service as a sergeant, initially in the Intelligence Corps, then in the Army Education Corps, spending much of the time in Germany writing letters home for other soldiers. After being demobbed he worked for six years as an insurance clerk in the claims and accident departments of the Commercial Union Insurance Company.

Rossiter started acting after his actress girlfriend challenged him to try it, after he had scoffed at the performances of the amateur group she was in. He joined the Wavertree Community Centre Drama Group and made his first appearance with the Adastra Players in Terence Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;Flare Path&quot;. The local critic said that he &quot;was particularly outstanding, his one fault being a tendency to speak too fast on one or two occasions&quot;. He gave up his insurance job to enrol in Preston repertory theatre and became a professional actor at the age of 27. He made his professional stage debut in Joseph Colton&#x27;s &quot;The Gay Dog&quot; in Preston on 6 September 1954.

He later became assistant stage manager there, and then went on to Wolverhampton and Salisbury repertory companies. In his first 19 months in the business he played some 75 roles. He said later: &quot;There was no time to discuss the finer points of interpretation. You studied the part, you did it and then you studied the next part. I developed a frightening capacity for learning lines. The plays became like Elastoplast, which you just stuck on and then tore off. It was the perfect preparation for rehearsing situation comedy on television at the rate of one episode a week.&quot;

In 1957–58, he played in the musical &quot;Free as Air&quot; and then toured in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot;. He joined the Bristol Old Vic and was there for two years, from 1959 to 1961, a time he described as &quot;the bedrock of his career&quot;, followed by other stage work, in, among other plays, &quot;The Strange Case of Martin Richter&quot;, &quot;Disabled&quot;, &quot;The Heretic&quot;, &quot;The Caretaker&quot; and &quot;Semi-Detached&quot; (in New York). His performance in the premiere of Michael Blakemore&#x27;s stage production of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui&quot; in 1969 met with critical acclaim.

==Film and television career==
Rossiter soon established himself as a character actor in films and television, as well as on stage. He stated: &quot;I think I sensed fairly early on that I was not physically or facially built in the way that would ever fit even remotely into heroic or what used to be called juvenile parts. I always played character parts – right from the start.&quot; His first film role was in &quot;A Kind of Loving&quot; (1962). In &quot;Billy Liar&quot; (1963) he played the title character&#x27;s boss. His first major television role was as Detective-Inspector Bamber in the long-running police television series &quot;Z-Cars&quot;. He also had guest roles in series as diverse as &quot;The Avengers&quot; (&quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;, 1963) and &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; (&quot;The Lead Man Cometh&quot;, 1964; &quot;The Desperate Hours&quot;, 1972). Among his early film credits were four films directed by Bryan Forbes, namely &quot;King Rat&quot; (1965), &quot;The Wrong Box&quot; (1966), &quot;The Whisperers&quot; (1967), and &quot;Deadfall&quot; (1968).

In 1968, he played Mr Sowerberry in the film version of Lionel Bart&#x27;s musical &quot;Oliver!&quot; and took one of the few speaking supporting roles in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; as the Russian scientist Smyslov. He worked with Stanley Kubrick again in &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; (1975), in the role of Captain John Quin. He appeared opposite Peter Sellers in &quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot; (1976) as Superintendent Quinlan. In 1968, he appeared in Nigel Kneale&#x27;s television play &quot;The Year of the Sex Olympics&quot;, an episode of BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Theatre 625&quot;, one of his four appearances in the series.

In &quot;Rising Damp&quot;, on ITV, Rossiter played Rupert Rigsby, the lecherous landlord of a house converted into shabby bedsits, reprising the role from the successful stage version, &quot;The Banana Box&quot;. While he was in &quot;Rising Damp&quot; he also took the lead role in &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot;, adapted by David Nobbs from his own comic novels and broadcast on the BBC. Rossiter was given a surprise tribute on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1975. He appeared in &quot;I Tell You It&#x27;s Burt Reynolds&quot;, an episode of the 1977 Yorkshire Television series &quot;The Galton &amp; Simpson Playhouse&quot;, as well as the short films &quot;The Waterloo Bridge Handicap&quot; (1978), and the Galton and Simpson-scripted &quot;Le Pétomane&quot; (1979). After his portrayal of Reginald Perrin, Rossiter&#x27;s non-comedy roles on television became less frequent, although there were exceptions, such as a debt collector in the one-off HTV thriller &quot;Machinegunner&quot; (1976), and Frank Harris in &quot;Fearless Frank, or Tit-bits from the Life of an Adventurer&quot; (1978), a BBC &quot;Play of the Week&quot;.

From 1978 to 1983, Rossiter performed in ten commercials for Cinzano. The series of adverts was created by film director Alan Parker and, at Rossiter&#x27;s suggestion, used an old music hall joke where he spills a drink over his wife, played by Joan Collins. In the Channel 4 programme &quot;The 100 Greatest TV Ads&quot; (2000) Terry Lovelock, the director of two of the commercials, said that Rossiter used to refer jokingly to Collins as &quot;The Prop&quot;.

Rossiter reprised Rigsby for a film version of &quot;Rising Damp&quot; in 1980, thus achieving the distinction of playing the same role on stage, television, and film. He continued to make a steady stream of film appearances, including a role in Lindsay Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Britannia Hospital&quot; (1982). His last television role was as the supermarket manager in another ITV sitcom, &quot;Tripper&#x27;s Day&quot; (1984).

He performed comic monologues in &quot;The Green Tie on the Little Yellow Dog&quot;, which was recorded 1982, and broadcast by Channel 4 in 1983.

Rossiter also played the title role in the &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; production of &quot;The Life and Death of King John&quot; (1984). His last film appearance was in &quot;Water&quot; (1985).

==Radio and voice work==
In the animated adaptation of &quot;The Perishers&quot; (1979), Rossiter provided the voice for Boot the dog. He narrated an abridged version of the Charles Dickens book &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, which was released on cassette in 1979. He appeared on the BBC Radio 4 show &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in 1980. In 1981, he hosted an episode of the BBC Radio 4 show &quot;With Great Pleasure&quot; in which he recited some of his favorite poetry and prose alongside his wife, Gillian Raine, and his friend, the actor James Grout. Also in 1981, he narrated a seven-part series of satirical five-minute monologues, written by Barry Pilton for BBC Radio 3, titled &quot;In a Nutshell&quot;, followed in 1982 by a second series, also written by Barry Pilton, this time comprising 8 five-minute monologues. Rossiter narrated a three-part series of the children&#x27;s story &quot;Harlequin and Columbine&quot; for &quot;Story Teller&quot; magazine in 1984. He voiced the King of Hearts in two episodes of Anglia Television&#x27;s version of &quot;Alice In Wonderland&quot;, which was broadcast in April 1985, six months after Rossiter&#x27;s death.

==Writing==
Rossiter displayed his acid wit in two books: &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Bedside Book&quot; (1980), a collection of cynical dictionary definitions in the style of Ambrose Bierce&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, and &quot;The Lowest Form of Wit&quot;, (1981), a collection of biting bons mots, stinging retorts, insults and sarcasm illustrated with cartoons by Martin Honeysett. He also wrote the introduction to cook Keith Floyd&#x27;s 1981 book &quot;Floyd&#x27;s Food&quot;.

==Personal life==
Rossiter&#x27;s first marriage was to the actress Josephine Tewson, with whom he had worked many times in repertory theatre in the 1950s. They married in 1958. The marriage ended in divorce in 1961. His second wife was the actress Gillian Raine, with whom he had a daughter, Camilla, and to whom he was still married at the time of his death. Rossiter had met Raine when he played the lead role of Fred Midway in David Turner&#x27;s play &quot;Semi-Detached&quot;, in a production directed by Tony Richardson. The play opened on 8 June 1962 at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry and ran for a week. During the play&#x27;s second run at the Belgrade, in September 1963, the couple fell in love and moved in together, but they did not marry until 1972.

Rossiter was an Everton fan. He was also a wine connoisseur, and converted his attic into a sort of wine cellar.

After his death, it was revealed that during the early 1980s Rossiter had had a five-year relationship with the broadcaster Sue MacGregor. His wife had not been aware of the affair until she received a letter from MacGregor breaking the news that her memoirs, which were about to be published, would include an account of the affair.

==Death==
On 5 October 1984, Rossiter died from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy while waiting to go onstage at the Lyric Theatre, London, where he was performing in Joe Orton&#x27;s play &quot;Loot&quot;. His funeral took place at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, The Boltons, London. 

A memorial service was held on 15 November 1984 at St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden. Attendees included Rossiter&#x27;s &quot;Loot&quot; castmates, as well as Derek Nimmo, Fulton Mackay, and Ned Sherrin. &quot;Loot&quot; director, Jonathan Lynn, gave a eulogy in which he said of Rossiter: &quot;Now that Leonard is up there, things had better be properly managed: I hope that the Heavenly Gates opened on cue and that the Choir of Angels is singing in tune. They had better be professional in Paradise. Because, if not, they&#x27;ll certainly hear about it from Leonard.&quot;

==Legacy and tributes==
Rossiter was posthumously nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for &quot;Comedy Performance of the Year&quot;, for his role as Inspector Truscott in &quot;Loot&quot;.

In 1985, the book &quot;Leonard Rossiter&quot; by author Robert Tanitch was published. The book featured a collection of rare photos and reminiscences from friends and colleagues of Rossiter&#x27;s.

In 2000, the ITV biography series &quot;The Unforgettable&quot; broadcast an episode about Rossiter&#x27;s life. His wife and daughter were interviewed, as well as former colleagues, including Don Warrington, Joan Collins, and Sue Nicholls.

A biography of Rossiter, titled &quot;Leonard Rossiter: Character Driven&quot; was published in 2010 by author Guy Adams.

<doc id="48356" wikidata="Q626500" url="?curid=48356" title="Substitution cipher">
<text>In cryptography, a substitution cipher is a method of encrypting in which units of plaintext are replaced with the ciphertext, in a defined manner, with the help of a key; the &quot;units&quot; may be single letters (the most common), pairs of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the above, and so forth. The receiver deciphers the text by performing the inverse substitution process to extract the original message.

Substitution ciphers can be compared with transposition ciphers. In a transposition cipher, the units of the plaintext are rearranged in a different and usually quite complex order, but the units themselves are left unchanged. By contrast, in a substitution cipher, the units of the plaintext are retained in the same sequence in the ciphertext, but the units themselves are altered.

There are a number of different types of substitution cipher. If the cipher operates on single letters, it is termed a simple substitution cipher; a cipher that operates on larger groups of letters is termed polygraphic. A monoalphabetic cipher uses fixed substitution over the entire message, whereas a polyalphabetic cipher uses a number of substitutions at different positions in the message, where a unit from the plaintext is mapped to one of several possibilities in the ciphertext and vice versa.

The first ever published description of how to crack simple substitution ciphers was given by Al-Kindi in &quot;A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages&quot; written around 850 CE. The method he described is now known as frequency analysis.


==Types==
===Simple===
The simplest substitution ciphers are the Caesar cipher and Atbash cipher. Here single letters are substituted (referred to as simple substitution). It can be demonstrated by writing out the alphabet twice, once in regular order and again with the letters shifted by some number of steps or reversed to represent the &quot;ciphertext alphabet&quot; (or substitution alphabet).

The substitution alphabet could also be scrambled in a more complex fashion, in which case it is called a mixed alphabet or &quot;deranged alphabet&quot;. Traditionally, mixed alphabets may be created by first writing out a keyword, removing repeated letters in it, then writing all the remaining letters in the alphabet in the usual order.

Using this system, the keyword &quot; gives us the following alphabets:

A message 
 flee at once. we are discovered!

enciphers to

 SIAA ZQ LKBA. VA ZOA RFPBLUAOAR!

And the keyword &quot; gives us the following alphabets:
The same message 
 flee at once. we are discovered!

enciphers to

 MCDD GS JIAD. WD GPD NHQAJVDPDN!

Usually the ciphertext is written out in blocks of fixed length, omitting punctuation and spaces; this is done to disguise word boundaries from the plaintext and to help avoid transmission errors. These blocks are called &quot;groups&quot;, and sometimes a &quot;group count&quot; (i.e. the number of groups) is given as an additional check. Five-letter groups are often used, dating from when messages used to be transmitted by telegraph:

 SIAAZ QLKBA VAZOA RFPBL UAOAR

If the length of the message happens not to be divisible by five, it may be padded at the end with &quot;nulls&quot;. These can be any characters that decrypt to obvious nonsense, so that the receiver can easily spot them and discard them.

The ciphertext alphabet is sometimes different from the plaintext alphabet; for example, in the pigpen cipher, the ciphertext consists of a set of symbols derived from a grid. For example:

Such features make little difference to the security of a scheme, however – at the very least, any set of strange symbols can be transcribed back into an A-Z alphabet and dealt with as normal.

In lists and catalogues for salespeople, a very simple encryption is sometimes used to replace numeric digits by letters.

Examples: MAT would be used to represent 120, PAPR would be used for 5256, and OFTK would be used for 7803.

Although the traditional keyword method for creating a mixed substitution alphabet is simple, a serious disadvantage is that the last letters of the alphabet (which are mostly low frequency) tend to stay at the end. A stronger way of constructing a mixed alphabet is to generate the substitution alphabet completely randomly.

Although the number of possible substitution alphabets is very large (26! ≈ 288.4, or about 88 bits), this cipher is not very strong, and is easily broken. Provided the message is of reasonable length (see below), the cryptanalyst can deduce the probable meaning of the most common symbols by analyzing the frequency distribution of the ciphertext. This allows formation of partial words, which can be tentatively filled in, progressively expanding the (partial) solution (see frequency analysis for a demonstration of this). In some cases, underlying words can also be determined from the pattern of their letters; for example, the English words &quot;tater&quot;, &quot;ninth&quot;, and &quot;paper&quot; all have the pattern &quot;ABACD&quot;. Many people solve such ciphers for recreation, as with cryptogram puzzles in the newspaper.

According to the unicity distance of English, 27.6 letters of ciphertext are required to crack a mixed alphabet simple substitution. In practice, typically about 50 letters are needed, although some messages can be broken with fewer if unusual patterns are found. In other cases, the plaintext can be contrived to have a nearly flat frequency distribution, and much longer plaintexts will then be required by the cryptanalyst.

===Nomenclator===
One once-common variant of the substitution cipher is the nomenclator. Named after the public official who announced the titles of visiting dignitaries, this cipher uses a small code sheet containing letter, syllable and word substitution tables, sometimes homophonic, that typically converted symbols into numbers. Originally the code portion was restricted to the names of important people, hence the name of the cipher; in later years, it covered many common words and place names as well. The symbols for whole words (&quot;codewords&quot; in modern parlance) and letters (&quot;cipher&quot; in modern parlance) were not distinguished in the ciphertext. The Rossignols&#x27; Great Cipher used by Louis XIV of France was one.

Nomenclators were the standard fare of diplomatic correspondence, espionage, and advanced political conspiracy from the early fifteenth century to the late eighteenth century; most conspirators were and have remained less cryptographically sophisticated. Although government intelligence cryptanalysts were systematically breaking nomenclators by the mid-sixteenth century, and superior systems had been available since 1467, the usual response to cryptanalysis was simply to make the tables larger. By the late eighteenth century, when the system was beginning to die out, some nomenclators had 50,000 symbols.

Nevertheless, not all nomenclators were broken; today, cryptanalysis of archived ciphertexts remains a fruitful area of historical research.

=== Homophonic ===
An early attempt to increase the difficulty of frequency analysis attacks on substitution ciphers was to disguise plaintext letter frequencies by homophony. In these ciphers, plaintext letters map to more than one ciphertext symbol. Usually, the highest-frequency plaintext symbols are given more equivalents than lower frequency letters. In this way, the frequency distribution is flattened, making analysis more difficult.

Since more than 26 characters will be required in the ciphertext alphabet, various solutions are employed to invent larger alphabets. Perhaps the simplest is to use a numeric substitution &#x27;alphabet&#x27;. Another method consists of simple variations on the existing alphabet; uppercase, lowercase, upside down, etc. More artistically, though not necessarily more securely, some homophonic ciphers employed wholly invented alphabets of fanciful symbols.

The book cipher is a type of homophonic cipher, one example being the Beale ciphers. This is a story of buried treasure that was described in 1819–21 by use of a ciphered text that was keyed to the Declaration of Independence. Here each ciphertext character was represented by a number. The number was determined by taking the plaintext character and finding a word in the Declaration of Independence that started with that character and using the numerical position of that word in the Declaration of Independence as the encrypted form of that letter. Since many words in the Declaration of Independence start with the same letter, the encryption of that character could be any of the numbers associated with the words in the Declaration of Independence that start with that letter. Deciphering the encrypted text character &quot;X&quot; (which is a number) is as simple as looking up the Xth word of the Declaration of Independence and using the first letter of that word as the decrypted character.

Another homophonic cipher was described by Stahl and was one of the first attempts to provide for computer security of data systems in computers through encryption. Stahl constructed the cipher in such a way that the number of homophones for a given character was in proportion to the frequency of the character, thus making frequency analysis much more difficult.

Francesco I Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, used the earliest known example of a homophonic substitution cipher in 1401 for correspondence with one Simone de Crema.

Mary, Queen of Scots, while imprisoned by Elizabeth I, during the years from 1578 to 1584 used homophonic ciphers with additional encryption using a nomenclator for frequent prefixes, suffixes, and proper names while communicating with her allies including Michel de Castelnau.

=== Polyalphabetic ===
The work of Al-Qalqashandi (1355-1418), based on the earlier work of Ibn al-Durayhim (1312–1359), contained the first published discussion of the substitution and transposition of ciphers, as well as the first description of a polyalphabetic cipher, in which each plaintext letter is assigned more than one substitute. Polyalphabetic substitution ciphers were later described in 1467 by Leone Battista Alberti in the form of disks. Johannes Trithemius, in his book &quot;Steganographia&quot; (Ancient Greek for &quot;hidden writing&quot;) introduced the now more standard form of a &quot;tableau&quot; (see below; ca. 1500 but not published until much later). A more sophisticated version using mixed alphabets was described in 1563 by Giovanni Battista della Porta in his book, &quot;De Furtivis Literarum Notis&quot; (Latin for &quot;On concealed characters in writing&quot;).

In a polyalphabetic cipher, multiple cipher alphabets are used. To facilitate encryption, all the alphabets are usually written out in a large table, traditionally called a &quot;tableau&quot;. The tableau is usually 26×26, so that 26 full ciphertext alphabets are available. The method of filling the tableau, and of choosing which alphabet to use next, defines the particular polyalphabetic cipher. All such ciphers are easier to break than once believed, as substitution alphabets are repeated for sufficiently large plaintexts.

One of the most popular was that of Blaise de Vigenère. First published in 1585, it was considered unbreakable until 1863, and indeed was commonly called &quot;le chiffre indéchiffrable&quot; (French for &quot;indecipherable cipher&quot;).

In the Vigenère cipher, the first row of the tableau is filled out with a copy of the plaintext alphabet, and successive rows are simply shifted one place to the left. (Such a simple tableau is called a &quot;tabula recta&quot;, and mathematically corresponds to adding the plaintext and key letters, modulo 26.) A keyword is then used to choose which ciphertext alphabet to use. Each letter of the keyword is used in turn, and then they are repeated again from the beginning. So if the keyword is &#x27;CAT&#x27;, the first letter of plaintext is enciphered under alphabet &#x27;C&#x27;, the second under &#x27;A&#x27;, the third under &#x27;T&#x27;, the fourth under &#x27;C&#x27; again, and so on, or if the keyword is &#x27;RISE&#x27;, the first letter of plaintext is enciphered under alphabet &#x27;R&#x27;, the second under &#x27;I&#x27;, the third under &#x27;S&#x27;, the fourth under &#x27;E&#x27;, and so on. In practice, Vigenère keys were often phrases several words long.

In 1863, Friedrich Kasiski published a method (probably discovered secretly and independently before the Crimean War by Charles Babbage) which enabled the calculation of the length of the keyword in a Vigenère ciphered message. Once this was done, ciphertext letters that had been enciphered under the same alphabet could be picked out and attacked separately as a number of semi-independent simple substitutions - complicated by the fact that within one alphabet letters were separated and did not form complete words, but simplified by the fact that usually a &quot;tabula recta&quot; had been employed.

As such, even today a Vigenère type cipher should theoretically be difficult to break if mixed alphabets are used in the tableau, if the keyword is random, and if the total length of ciphertext is less than 27.67 times the length of the keyword. These requirements are rarely understood in practice, and so Vigenère enciphered message security is usually less than might have been.

Other notable polyalphabetics include:
* The Gronsfeld cipher. This is identical to the Vigenère except that only 10 alphabets are used, and so the &quot;keyword&quot; is numerical.
* The Beaufort cipher. This is practically the same as the Vigenère, except the &quot;tabula recta&quot; is replaced by a backwards one, mathematically equivalent to ciphertext = key - plaintext. This operation is &quot;self-inverse&quot;, whereby the same table is used for both encryption and decryption.
* The autokey cipher, which mixes plaintext with a key to avoid periodicity.
* The running key cipher, where the key is made very long by using a passage from a book or similar text.

Modern stream ciphers can also be seen, from a sufficiently abstract perspective, to be a form of polyalphabetic cipher in which all the effort has gone into making the keystream as long and unpredictable as possible.

=== Polygraphic ===
In a polygraphic substitution cipher, plaintext letters are substituted in larger groups, instead of substituting letters individually. The first advantage is that the frequency distribution is much flatter than that of individual letters (though not actually flat in real languages; for example, &#x27;OS&#x27; is much more common than &#x27;RÑ&#x27; in Spanish). Second, the larger number of symbols requires correspondingly more ciphertext to productively analyze letter frequencies.

To substitute &quot;pairs&quot; of letters would take a substitution alphabet 676 symbols long (formula_1). In the same &quot;De Furtivis Literarum Notis&quot; mentioned above, della Porta actually proposed such a system, with a 20 x 20 tableau (for the 20 letters of the Italian/Latin alphabet he was using) filled with 400 unique glyphs. However the system was impractical and probably never actually used.

The earliest practical digraphic cipher (pairwise substitution), was the so-called Playfair cipher, invented by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1854. In this cipher, a 5 x 5 grid is filled with the letters of a mixed alphabet (two letters, usually I and J, are combined). A digraphic substitution is then simulated by taking pairs of letters as two corners of a rectangle, and using the other two corners as the ciphertext (see the Playfair cipher main article for a diagram). Special rules handle double letters and pairs falling in the same row or column. Playfair was in military use from the Boer War through World War II.

Several other practical polygraphics were introduced in 1901 by Felix Delastelle, including the bifid and four-square ciphers (both digraphic) and the trifid cipher (probably the first practical trigraphic).

The Hill cipher, invented in 1929 by Lester S. Hill, is a polygraphic substitution which can combine much larger groups of letters simultaneously using linear algebra. Each letter is treated as a digit in base 26: A = 0, B =1, and so on. (In a variation, 3 extra symbols are added to make the basis prime.) A block of n letters is then considered as a vector of n dimensions, and multiplied by a n x n matrix, modulo 26. The components of the matrix are the key, and should be random provided that the matrix is invertible in formula_2 (to ensure decryption is possible). A mechanical version of the Hill cipher of dimension 6 was patented in 1929.

The Hill cipher is vulnerable to a known-plaintext attack because it is completely linear, so it must be combined with some non-linear step to defeat this attack. The combination of wider and wider weak, linear diffusive steps like a Hill cipher, with non-linear substitution steps, ultimately leads to a substitution–permutation network (e.g. a Feistel cipher), so it is possible – from this extreme perspective – to consider modern block ciphers as a type of polygraphic substitution.

===Mechanical===
Between around World War I and the widespread availability of computers (for some governments this was approximately the 1950s or 1960s; for other organizations it was a decade or more later; for individuals it was no earlier than 1975), mechanical implementations of polyalphabetic substitution ciphers were widely used. Several inventors had similar ideas about the same time, and rotor cipher machines were patented four times in 1919. The most important of the resulting machines was the Enigma, especially in the versions used by the German military from approximately 1930. The Allies also developed and used rotor machines (e.g., SIGABA and Typex).

All of these were similar in that the substituted letter was chosen electrically from amongst the huge number of possible combinations resulting from the rotation of several letter disks. Since one or more of the disks rotated mechanically with each plaintext letter enciphered, the number of alphabets used was astronomical. Early versions of these machine were, nevertheless, breakable. William F. Friedman of the US Army&#x27;s SIS early found vulnerabilities in Hebern&#x27;s rotor machine, and GC&amp;CS&#x27;s Dillwyn Knox solved versions of the Enigma machine (those without the &quot;plugboard&quot;) well before WWII began. Traffic protected by essentially all of the German military Enigmas was broken by Allied cryptanalysts, most notably those at Bletchley Park, beginning with the German Army variant used in the early 1930s. This version was broken by inspired mathematical insight by Marian Rejewski in Poland.

As far as is publicly known, no messages protected by the SIGABA and Typex machines were ever broken during or near the time when these systems were in service.

===One-time pad===

One type of substitution cipher, the one-time pad, is unique. It was invented near the end of World War I by Gilbert Vernam and Joseph Mauborgne in the US. It was mathematically proven unbreakable by Claude Shannon, probably during World War II; his work was first published in the late 1940s. In its most common implementation, the one-time pad can be called a substitution cipher only from an unusual perspective; typically, the plaintext letter is combined (not substituted) in some manner (e.g., XOR) with the key material character at that position.

The one-time pad is, in most cases, impractical as it requires that the key material be as long as the plaintext, &quot;actually&quot; random, used once and &quot;only&quot; once, and kept entirely secret from all except the sender and intended receiver. When these conditions are violated, even marginally, the one-time pad is no longer unbreakable. Soviet one-time pad messages sent from the US for a brief time during World War II used non-random key material. US cryptanalysts, beginning in the late 40s, were able to, entirely or partially, break a few thousand messages out of several hundred thousand. (See Venona project)

In a mechanical implementation, rather like the Rockex equipment, the one-time pad was used for messages sent on the Moscow-Washington &quot;hot line&quot; established after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

== In modern cryptography ==
Substitution ciphers as discussed above, especially the older pencil-and-paper hand ciphers, are no longer in serious use. However, the cryptographic concept of substitution carries on even today. From an abstract perspective, modern bit-oriented block ciphers (e.g., DES, or AES) can be viewed as substitution ciphers on a large binary alphabet. In addition, block ciphers often include smaller substitution tables called S-boxes. See also substitution–permutation network.

== In popular culture ==
*Sherlock Holmes breaks a substitution cipher in &quot;The Adventure of the Dancing Men&quot;. There, the cipher remained undeciphered for years if not decades; not due to its difficulty, but because no one suspected it to be a code, instead considering it childish scribblings.
* The Standard Galactic Alphabet, the writing system in the &quot;Commander Keen&quot; video games and in &quot;Minecraft&quot;.
*The Al Bhed language in &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; is actually a substitution cipher, although it is pronounced phonetically (i.e. &quot;you&quot; in English is translated to &quot;oui&quot; in Al Bhed, but is pronounced the same way that &quot;oui&quot; is pronounced in French).
*The Minbari&#x27;s alphabet from the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; series is a substitution cipher from English.
*The language in &quot;Starfox Adventures: Dinosaur Planet&quot; spoken by native Saurians and Krystal is also a substitution cipher of the English alphabet.
*The television program &quot;Futurama&quot; contained a substitution cipher in which all 26 letters were replaced by symbols and called &quot;Alien Language&quot; . This was deciphered rather quickly by the die hard viewers by showing a &quot;Slurm&quot; ad with the word &quot;Drink&quot; in both plain English and the Alien language thus giving the key. Later, the producers created a second alien language that used a combination of replacement and mathematical Ciphers. Once the English letter of the alien language is deciphered, then the numerical value of that letter (0 for &quot;A&quot; through 25 for &quot;Z&quot; respectively) is then added (modulo 26) to the value of the previous letter showing the actual intended letter. These messages can be seen throughout every episode of the series and the subsequent movies.
*At the end of every season 1 episode of the cartoon series &quot;Gravity Falls&quot;, during the credit roll, there is one of three simple substitution ciphers: A -3 Caesar cipher (hinted by &quot;3 letters back&quot; at the end of the opening sequence), an Atbash cipher, or a letter-to-number simple substitution cipher. The season 1 finale encodes a message with all three. In the second season, Vigenère ciphers are used in place of the various monoalphabetic ciphers, each using a key hidden within its episode.
*In the Artemis Fowl series by Eoin Colfer there are three substitution ciphers; Gnommish, Centaurean and Eternean, which run along the bottom of the pages or are somewhere else within the books.
*In &quot;Bitterblue&quot;, the third novel by Kristin Cashore, substitution ciphers serve as an important form of coded communication.
*In the 2013 video game &quot;BioShock Infinite&quot;, there are substitution ciphers hidden throughout the game in which the player must find code books to help decipher them and gain access to a surplus of supplies.
*In the anime adaptation of &quot;The Devil Is a Part-Timer!&quot;, the language of Ente Isla, called Entean, uses a substitution cipher with the ciphertext alphabet , leaving only A, E, I, O, U, L, N, and Q in their original positions.

<text>In cryptography, a transposition cipher (also known as a permutation cipher) is a method of encryption which scrambles the positions of characters (&quot;transposition&quot;) without changing the characters themselves. Transposition ciphers reorder units of plaintext (typically characters or groups of characters) according to a regular system to produce a ciphertext which is a permutation of the plaintext. They differ from substitution ciphers, which do not change the position of units of plaintext but instead change the units themselves. Despite the difference between transposition and substitution operations, they are often combined, as in historical ciphers like the ADFGVX cipher or complex high-quality encryption methods like the modern Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

== General principle ==
Plaintexts can be rearranged into a ciphertext using a key, scrambling the order of characters like the shuffled pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. The resulting message is hard to decipher without the key because there are many ways the characters can be arranged.

For example, the plaintext &quot;THIS IS WIKIPEDIA&quot; could be encrypted to &quot;TWDIP SIHII IKASE&quot;. To decipher the encrypted message without the key, an attacker could try to guess possible words and phrases like DIATHESIS, DISSIPATE, WIDTH, etc., but it would take them some time to reconstruct the plaintext because there are many combinations of letters and words. By contrast, someone with the key could reconstruct the message easily:
 C I P H E R Key
 1 4 5 3 2 6 Sequence (key letters in alphabetical order)
 T H I S I S Plaintext
 W I K I P E
 D I A * * *
 Ciphertext by column:
 #1 TWD, #2 IP, #3 SI, #4 HII, #5 IKA, #6 SE
 Ciphertext in groups of 5 for readability:
 TWDIP SIHII IKASE
In practice, a message this short and with a predictable keyword would be broken almost immediately with cryptanalysis techniques. Transposition ciphers have several vulnerabilities (see the section on &quot;Detection and cryptanalysis&quot; below), and small mistakes in the encipherment process can render the entire ciphertext meaningless.

However, given the right conditions - long messages (e.g., over 100–200 letters), unpredictable contents, unique keys per message, strong transposition methods, and so on - guessing the right words could be computationally impossible without further information. In their book on codebreaking historical ciphers, Elonka Dunin and Klaus Schmeh describe double columnar transposition (see below) as &quot;one of the best manual ciphers known&quot;.

== Rail Fence cipher ==

The Rail Fence cipher is a form of transposition cipher that gets its name from the way in which it is encoded. In the rail fence cipher, the plaintext is written downward and diagonally on successive &quot;rails&quot; of an imaginary fence, then moves up when it gets to the bottom. The message is then read off in rows. For example, using three &quot;rails&quot; and a message of &#x27;WE ARE DISCOVERED FLEE AT ONCE&#x27;, the encrypter writes out:
 W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E
 . E . R . D . S . O . E . E . F . E . A . O . C .
 . . A . . . I . . . V . . . D . . . E . . . N . .

Then reads off:

 WECRL TEERD SOEEF EAOCA IVDEN

(The cipher has broken this ciphertext up into blocks of five to help avoid errors. This is a common technique used to make the cipher more easily readable. The spacing is not related to spaces in the plaintext and so does not carry any information about the plaintext.)

== Scytale ==

The rail fence cipher follows a pattern similar to that of the scytale, (pronounced &quot;SKIT-uhl-ee&quot;) a mechanical system of producing a transposition cipher used by the ancient Greeks. The system consisted of a cylinder and a ribbon that was wrapped around the cylinder. The message to be encrypted was written on the coiled ribbon. The letters of the original message would be rearranged when the ribbon was uncoiled from the cylinder. However, the message was easily decrypted when the ribbon recoiled on a cylinder of the same diameter as the encrypting cylinder. Using the same example as before, if the cylinder has a radius such that only three letters can fit around its circumference, the cipherer writes out:

 W . . E . . A . . R . . E . . D . . I . . S . . C
 . O . . V . . E . . R . . E . . D . . F . . L . .
 . . E . . E . . A . . T . . O . . N . . C . . E .

In this example, the cylinder is running horizontally and the ribbon is wrapped around vertically. Hence, the cipherer then reads off:

 WOEEV EAEAR RTEEO DDNIF CSLEC

== Route cipher ==
In a route cipher, the plaintext is first written out in a grid of given dimensions, then read off in a pattern given in the key. For example, using the same plaintext that we used for rail fence:
 W R I O R F E O E 
 E E S V E L A N J 
 A D C E D E T C X 
The key might specify &quot;spiral inwards, clockwise, starting from the top right&quot;. That would give a cipher text of:

 EJXCTEDEC DAEWRIORF EONALEVSE

Route ciphers have many more keys than a rail fence. In fact, for messages of reasonable length, the number of possible keys is potentially too great to be enumerated even by modern machinery. However, not all keys are equally good. Badly chosen routes will leave excessive chunks of plaintext, or text simply reversed, and this will give cryptanalysts a clue as to the routes.

A variation of the route cipher was the Union Route Cipher, used by Union forces during the American Civil War. This worked much like an ordinary route cipher, but transposed whole words instead of individual letters. Because this would leave certain highly sensitive words exposed, such words would first be concealed by code. The cipher clerk may also add entire null words, which were often chosen to make the ciphertext humorous. 

== Columnar transposition ==

In the middle of the 17th century, Samuel Morland introduced an early form of columnar transposition. It was further developed much later, becoming very popular in the later 19th century and 20th century, with French military, Japanese diplomats and Soviet spies all using the principle.

In a columnar transposition, the message is written out in rows of a fixed length, and then read out again column by column, and the columns are chosen in some scrambled order. Both the width of the rows and the permutation of the columns are usually defined by a keyword. For example, the keyword is of length 6 (so the rows are of length 6), and the permutation is defined by the alphabetical order of the letters in the keyword. In this case, the order would be &quot;6 3 2 4 1 5&quot;.

In a regular columnar transposition cipher, any spare spaces are filled with nulls; in an irregular columnar transposition cipher, the spaces are left blank. Finally, the message is read off in columns, in the order specified by the keyword. For example, suppose we use the keyword and the message . In a regular columnar transposition, we write this into the grid as follows:
 6 3 2 4 1 5
 W E A R E D
 I S C O V E 
 R E D F L E 
 E A T O N C 
 E Q K J E U 
providing five nulls (), these letters can be randomly selected as they just fill out the incomplete columns and are not part of the message. The ciphertext is then read off as:
 EVLNE ACDTK ESEAQ ROFOJ DEECU WIREE

In the irregular case, the columns are not completed by nulls:
 6 3 2 4 1 5
 W E A R E D 
 I S C O V E 
 R E D F L E 
 E A T O N C 
 E 
This results in the following ciphertext:
 EVLNA CDTES EAROF ODEEC WIREE

To decipher it, the recipient has to work out the shape of the enciphering grid by dividing the message length by the key length to find the number of rows in the grid. The length of the grid&#x27;s last line is given by the remainder. The key is written above the grid, and the ciphertext is written down the columns of the grid in the order given by the letters of the key. The plaintext appears on the rows. A partial decipherment of the above ciphertext, after writing in the first column:

 6 3 2 4 1 5
 . . . . E .
 . . . . V .
 . . . . L .
 . . . . N .

In a variation, the message is blocked into segments that are the key length long and to each segment the same permutation (given by the key) is applied. This is equivalent to a columnar transposition where the read-out is by rows instead of columns.

Columnar transposition continued to be used for serious purposes as a component of more complex ciphers at least into the 1950s.

== Double transposition ==
A single columnar transposition could be attacked by guessing possible column lengths, writing the message out in its columns (but in the wrong order, as the key is not yet known), and then looking for possible anagrams. Thus to make it stronger, a double transposition was often used. This is simply a columnar transposition applied twice. The same key can be used for both transpositions, or two different keys can be used.

=== Visual demonstration of double transposition ===
In the following example, we use the keys JANEAUSTEN and AEROPLANES to encrypt the following plaintext: &quot;Transposition ciphers scramble letters like puzzle pieces to create an indecipherable arrangement.&quot;The colors show how the letters are scrambled in each transposition step. While a single step only causes a minor rearrangement, the second step leads to a significant scrambling effect if the last row of the grid is incomplete.

=== Another example ===
As an example, we can take the result of the irregular columnar transposition in the previous section, and perform a second encryption with a different keyword, , which gives the permutation &quot;564231&quot;:
 5 6 4 2 3 1 
 E V L N A C
 D T E S E A
 R O F O D E
 E C W I R E
 E

As before, this is read off columnwise to give the ciphertext:

 CAEEN SOIAE DRLEF WEDRE EVTOC

If multiple messages of exactly the same length are encrypted using the same keys, they can be anagrammed simultaneously. This can lead to both recovery of the messages, and to recovery of the keys (so that every other message sent with those keys can be read).

During World War I, the German military used a double columnar transposition cipher, changing the keys infrequently. The system was regularly solved by the French, naming it Übchi, who were typically able to quickly find the keys once they&#x27;d intercepted a number of messages of the same length, which generally took only a few days. However, the French success became widely known and, after a publication in &quot;Le Matin&quot;, the Germans changed to a new system on 18 November 1914.

During World War II, the double transposition cipher was used by Dutch Resistance groups, the French Maquis and the British Special Operations Executive (SOE), which was in charge of managing underground activities in Europe. It was also used by agents of the American Office of Strategic Services and as an emergency cipher for the German Army and Navy.

Until the invention of the VIC cipher, double transposition was generally regarded as the most complicated cipher that an agent could operate reliably under difficult field conditions.

=== Cryptanalysis ===

The double transposition cipher can be treated as a single transposition with a key as long as the product of the lengths of the two keys.

In late 2013, a double transposition challenge, regarded by its author as undecipherable, was solved by George Lasry using a divide-and-conquer approach where each transposition was attacked individually.

== Myszkowski transposition ==

A variant form of columnar transposition, proposed by Émile Victor Théodore Myszkowski in 1902, requires a keyword with recurrent letters. In usual practice, subsequent occurrences of a keyword letter are treated as if the next letter in alphabetical order, &quot;e.g.,&quot; the keyword TOMATO yields a numeric keystring of &quot;532164.&quot;

In Myszkowski transposition, recurrent keyword letters are numbered identically, TOMATO yielding a keystring of &quot;432143.&quot;

 4 3 2 1 4 3
 W E A R E D
 I S C O V E
 R E D F L E
 E A T O N C
 E

Plaintext columns with unique numbers are transcribed downward;
those with recurring numbers are transcribed left to right:

 ROFOA CDTED SEEEA CWEIV RLENE

== Disrupted transposition ==

A disrupted transposition cipher further complicates the transposition pattern with irregular filling of the rows of the matrix, i.e. with some spaces intentionally left blank (or blackened out like in the Rasterschlüssel 44), or filled later with either another part of the plaintext or random letters.

=== Comb approach ===

This method (attributed to Gen. Luigi Sacco) starts a new row once the plaintext reaches a column whose key number is equal to the current row number. This produces irregular row lengths. For example, 

 F O R E V E R J I G S A W &lt; Key
 4 8 9 2 12 3 10 7 6 5 11 1 13 Blanks after no.:
 C O M P L I C A T E S T * 1
 H E T R * * * * * * * * * 2
 A N S P O S * * * * * * * 3
 I * * * * * * * * * * * * 4
 T I O N P A T T E R * * * 5
 N L I K E A C O M * * * * 6
 B _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * * * * * 7

The columns are then taken off as per regular columnar transposition: TPRPN, KISAA, CHAIT, NBERT, EMATO, etc.

=== Numerical sequence approach ===

Another simple option would be to use a password that places blanks according to its number sequence. E.g. &quot;SECRET&quot; would be decoded to a sequence of &quot;5,2,1,4,3,6&quot; and cross out the 5th field of the matrix, then count again and cross out the second field, etc. The following example would be a matrix set up for columnar transposition with the columnar key &quot;CRYPTO&quot; and filled with crossed out fields according to the disruption key &quot;SECRET&quot; (marked with an asterisk), whereafter the message &quot;we are discovered, flee at once&quot; is placed in the leftover spaces. The resulting ciphertext (the columns read according to the transposition key) is &quot;WCEEO ERET RIVFC EODN SELE ADA&quot;.

 C R Y P T O
 1 4 6 3 5 2
 W E A R * E
 * * D I S *
 C O * V E R
 E D * F L E
 E * A * * T
 O N * C E *

== Grilles ==
Another form of transposition cipher uses &quot;grilles&quot;, or physical masks with cut-outs. This can produce a highly irregular transposition over the period specified by the size of the grille, but requires the correspondents to keep a physical key secret. Grilles were first proposed in 1550, and were still in military use for the first few months of World War One.

== Detection and cryptanalysis ==
Since transposition does not affect the frequency of individual symbols, simple transposition can be easily detected by the cryptanalyst by doing a frequency count. If the ciphertext exhibits a frequency distribution very similar to plaintext, it is most likely a transposition.

In general, transposition methods are vulnerable to anagramming—sliding pieces of ciphertext around, then looking for sections that look like anagrams of words in English or whatever language the plaintext was written in, and solving the anagrams. Once such anagrams have been found, they reveal information about the transposition pattern, and can consequently be extended. Simpler transpositions often suffer from the property that keys very close to the correct key will reveal long sections of legible plaintext interspersed by gibberish. Consequently, such ciphers may be vulnerable to optimum seeking algorithms such as genetic algorithms and hill-climbing algorithms.

There are several specific methods for attacking messages encoded using a transposition cipher. These include:

# Known-plaintext attack: Using known or guessed parts of the plaintext (e.g. names, places, dates, numbers, phrases) to assist in reverse-engineering the likely order of columns used to carry out the transposition and/or the likely topic of the plaintext.
# Brute-force attack: If keys are derived from dictionary words or phrases from books or other publicly available sources, it may be possible to brute-force the solution by attempting billions of possible words, word combinations, and phrases as keys.
# Depth attack: If two or more messages of the same length are encoded with the same keys, the messages can be aligned and anagrammed until the messages show meaningful text in the same places, without needing to know the transposition steps that have taken place.
# Statistical attack: Statistics about the frequency of 2-letter, 3-letter, etc. combinations in a language can be used to inform a scoring function in an algorithm that gradually reverses possible transpositions based on which changes would produce the most likely combinations. For example, the 2-letter pair QU is more common than QT in English text, so a cryptanalyst will attempt transpositions that place QU together.

The third method was developed in 1878 by mathematician Edward S. Holden and New-York Tribune journalists John R. G. Hassard and William M. Grosvenor who managed to deciphere telegrams between the Democratic Party and their operatives in the Southern states during the 1876 presidential election and thus prove facts of vote buying, influencing the 1878-1879 congressional elections.

A detailed description of the cryptanalysis of a German transposition cipher
can be found in chapter 7 of Herbert Yardley&#x27;s &quot;The American Black Chamber.&quot;

A cipher used by the Zodiac Killer, called &quot;Z-340&quot;, organized into triangular sections with substitution of 63 different symbols for the letters and diagonal &quot;knight move&quot; transposition, remained unsolved for over 51 years, until an international team of private citizens cracked it on December 5, 2020, using specialized software.

== Combinations ==
Transposition is often combined with other techniques such as evaluation methods. For example, a simple substitution cipher combined with a columnar transposition avoids the weakness of both. Replacing high frequency ciphertext symbols with high frequency plaintext letters does not reveal chunks of plaintext because of the transposition. Anagramming the transposition does not work because of the substitution. The technique is particularly powerful if combined with fractionation (see below). A disadvantage is that such ciphers are considerably more laborious and error prone than simpler ciphers.

== Fractionation ==
Transposition is particularly effective when employed with fractionation – that is, a preliminary stage that divides each plaintext symbol into two or more ciphertext symbols. For example, the plaintext alphabet could be written out in a grid, and every letter in the message replaced by its co-ordinates (see Polybius square and Straddling checkerboard).
Another method of fractionation is to simply convert the message to Morse code, with a symbol for spaces as well as dots and dashes.

When such a fractionated message is transposed, the components of individual letters become widely separated in the message, thus achieving Claude E. Shannon&#x27;s diffusion. Examples of ciphers that combine fractionation and transposition include the bifid cipher, the trifid cipher, the ADFGVX cipher and the VIC cipher.

Another choice would be to replace each letter with its binary representation, transpose that, and then convert the new binary string into the corresponding ASCII characters. Looping the scrambling process on the binary string multiple times before changing it into ASCII characters would likely make it harder to break. Many modern block ciphers use more complex forms of transposition related to this simple idea.

<text>A geographic coordinate system (GCS) is a spherical or geodetic coordinate system for measuring and communicating positions directly on Earth as latitude and longitude. It is the simplest, oldest and most widely used type of the various spatial reference systems that are in use, and forms the basis for most others. Although latitude and longitude form a coordinate tuple like a cartesian coordinate system, the geographic coordinate system is not cartesian because the measurements are angles and are not on a planar surface.

A full GCS specification, such as those listed in the EPSG and ISO 19111 standards, also includes a choice of geodetic datum (including an Earth ellipsoid), as different datums will yield different latitude and longitude values for the same location.

== History ==
The invention of a geographic coordinate system is generally credited to Eratosthenes of Cyrene, who composed his now-lost &quot;Geography&quot; at the Library of Alexandria in the 3rd century BC. A century later, Hipparchus of Nicaea improved on this system by determining latitude from stellar measurements rather than solar altitude and determining longitude by timings of lunar eclipses, rather than dead reckoning. In the 1st or 2nd century, Marinus of Tyre compiled an extensive gazetteer and mathematically plotted world map using coordinates measured east from a prime meridian at the westernmost known land, designated the Fortunate Isles, off the coast of western Africa around the Canary or Cape Verde Islands, and measured north or south of the island of Rhodes off Asia Minor. Ptolemy credited him with the full adoption of longitude and latitude, rather than measuring latitude in terms of the length of the midsummer day.

Ptolemy&#x27;s 2nd-century &quot;Geography&quot; used the same prime meridian but measured latitude from the Equator instead. After their work was translated into Arabic in the 9th century, Al-Khwārizmī&#x27;s &quot;Book of the Description of the Earth&quot; corrected Marinus&#x27; and Ptolemy&#x27;s errors regarding the length of the Mediterranean Sea, causing medieval Arabic cartography to use a prime meridian around 10° east of Ptolemy&#x27;s line. Mathematical cartography resumed in Europe following Maximus Planudes&#x27; recovery of Ptolemy&#x27;s text a little before 1300; the text was translated into Latin at Florence by Jacopo d&#x27;Angelo around 1407.

In 1884, the United States hosted the International Meridian Conference, attended by representatives from twenty-five nations. Twenty-two of them agreed to adopt the longitude of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England as the zero-reference line. The Dominican Republic voted against the motion, while France and Brazil abstained. France adopted Greenwich Mean Time in place of local determinations by the Paris Observatory in 1911.

==Latitude and longitude==

The &quot;latitude&quot;  of a point on Earth&#x27;s surface is the angle between the equatorial plane and the straight line that passes through that point and through (or close to) the center of the Earth. Lines joining points of the same latitude trace circles on the surface of Earth called parallels, as they are parallel to the Equator and to each other. The North Pole is 90° N; the South Pole is 90° S. The 0° parallel of latitude is designated the Equator, the fundamental plane of all geographic coordinate systems. The Equator divides the globe into Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

The &quot;longitude&quot;  of a point on Earth&#x27;s surface is the angle east or west of a reference meridian to another meridian that passes through that point. All meridians are halves of great ellipses (often called great circles), which converge at the North and South Poles. The meridian of the British Royal Observatory in Greenwich, in southeast London, England, is the international prime meridian, although some organizations—such as the French —continue to use other meridians for internal purposes. The prime meridian determines the proper Eastern and Western Hemispheres, although maps often divide these hemispheres further west in order to keep the Old World on a single side. The antipodal meridian of Greenwich is both 180°W and 180°E. This is not to be conflated with the International Date Line, which diverges from it in several places for political and convenience reasons, including between far eastern Russia and the far western Aleutian Islands.

The combination of these two components specifies the position of any location on the surface of Earth, without consideration of altitude or depth. The visual grid on a map formed by lines of latitude and longitude is known as a &quot;graticule&quot;. The origin/zero point of this system is located in the Gulf of Guinea about south of Tema, Ghana, a location often facetiously called Null Island.

== Geodetic datum ==

In order to use the theoretical definitions of latitude, longitude, and height to precisely measure actual locations on the physical earth, a &quot;geodetic datum&quot; must be used. A &quot;horizonal datum&quot; is used to precisely measure latitude and longitude, while a &quot;vertical datum&quot; is used to measure elevation or altitude. Both types of datum bind a mathematical model of the shape of the earth (usually a reference ellipsoid for a horizontal datum, and a more precise geoid for a vertical datum) to the earth. Traditionally, this binding was created by a network of control points, surveyed locations at which monuments are installed, and were only accurate for a region of the surface of the Earth. Newer datums are based on a global network for satellite measurements (GNSS, VLBI, SLR and DORIS).

This combination of mathematical model and physical binding mean that anyone using the same datum will obtain the same location measurement for the same physical location. However, two different datums will usually yield different location measurements for the same physical location, which may appear to differ by as much as several hundred meters; this not because the location has moved, but because the reference system used to measure it has shifted. Because any spatial reference system or map projection is ultimately calculated from latitude and longitude, it is crucial that they clearly state the datum on which they are based. For example, a UTM coordinate based on a WGS84 realisation will be different than a UTM coordinate based on NAD27 for the same location. Converting coordinates from one datum to another requires a datum transformation such as a Helmert transformation, although in certain situations a simple translation may be sufficient.

Datums may be global, meaning that they represent the whole Earth, or they may be regional, meaning that they represent an ellipsoid best-fit to only a portion of the Earth. Examples of global datums include the several realizations of WGS 84 (with the 2D datum ensemble EPSG:4326 with 2 meter accuracy as identifier) used for the Global Positioning System, and the several realizations of the International Terrestrial Reference System and Frame (such as ITRF2020 with subcentimeter accuracy), which takes into account continental drift and crustal deformation.

Datums with a regional fit of the ellipsoid that are chosen by a national cartographical organization include the North American Datums, the European ED50, and the British OSGB36. Given a location, the datum provides the latitude formula_1 and longitude formula_2. In the United Kingdom there are three common latitude, longitude, and height systems in use. WGS84 differs at Greenwich from the one used on published maps OSGB36 by approximately 112m. ED50 differs from about 120m to 180m.

Points on the Earth&#x27;s surface move relative to each other due to continental plate motion, subsidence, and diurnal Earth tidal movement caused by the Moon and the Sun. This daily movement can be as much as a meter. Continental movement can be up to a year, or in a century. A weather system high-pressure area can cause a sinking of . Scandinavia is rising by a year as a result of the melting of the ice sheets of the last ice age, but neighboring Scotland is rising by only . These changes are insignificant if a regional datum is used, but are statistically significant if a global datum is used.

==Length of a degree==

On the GRS80 or WGS84 spheroid at sea level at the Equator, one latitudinal second measures 30.715 m, one latitudinal minute is 1843 m and one latitudinal degree is 110.6 km. The circles of longitude, meridians, meet at the geographical poles, with the west–east width of a second naturally decreasing as latitude increases. On the Equator at sea level, one longitudinal second measures 30.92 m, a longitudinal minute is 1855 m and a longitudinal degree is 111.3 km. At 30° a longitudinal second is 26.76 m, at Greenwich (51°28′38″N) 19.22 m, and at 60° it is 15.42 m.

On the WGS84 spheroid, the length in meters of a degree of latitude at latitude (that is, the number of meters you would have to travel along a north–south line to move 1 degree in latitude, when at latitude ), is about

The returned measure of meters per degree latitude varies continuously with latitude.

Similarly, the length in meters of a degree of longitude can be calculated as

(Those coefficients can be improved, but as they stand the distance they give is correct within a centimeter.)

The formulae both return units of meters per degree.

An alternative method to estimate the length of a longitudinal degree at latitude formula_1 is to assume a spherical Earth (to get the width per minute and second, divide by 60 and 3600, respectively):

where Earth&#x27;s average meridional radius formula_4 is . Since the Earth is an oblate spheroid, not spherical, that result can be off by several tenths of a percent; a better approximation of a longitudinal degree at latitude formula_1 is

where Earth&#x27;s equatorial radius formula_6 equals 6,378,137 m and formula_7; for the GRS80 and WGS84 spheroids, formula_8. (formula_9 is known as the reduced (or parametric) latitude). Aside from rounding, this is the exact distance along a parallel of latitude; getting the distance along the shortest route will be more work, but those two distances are always within 0.6 m of each other if the two points are one degree of longitude apart.


==Alternative encodings==
Like any series of multiple-digit numbers, latitude-longitude pairs can be challenging to communicate and remember. Therefore, alternative schemes have been developed for encoding GCS coordinates into alphanumeric strings or words:
* the Maidenhead Locator System, popular with radio operators.
* the World Geographic Reference System (GEOREF), developed for global military operations, replaced by the current Global Area Reference System (GARS).
* Open Location Code or &quot;Plus Codes&quot;, developed by Google and released into the public domain.
* Geohash, a public domain system based on the Morton Z-order curve.
* Mapcode, an open-source system originally developed at TomTom.
* What3words, a proprietary system that encodes GCS coordinates as pseudorandom sets of words by dividing the coordinates into three numbers and looking up words in an indexed dictionary.

These are not distinct coordinate systems, only alternative methods for expressing latitude and longitude measurements.

<text>ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the Latin alphabet. 

ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher which was developed in ancient Rome, used by Julius Caesar in the 1st century BC. An early entry on the Timeline of cryptography. 

ROT13 can be referred by &quot;Rotate13&quot;, &quot;rotate by 13 places&quot;, hyphenated &quot;ROT-13&quot; or sometimes by its autonym &quot;EBG13&quot;.

==Description==
Applying ROT13 to a piece of text requires examining its alphabetic characters and replacing each one by the letter 13 places further along in the alphabet, wrapping back to the beginning if necessary.

To encode message: A becomes N, B becomes O, and so on up to M, which becomes Z, then the sequence continues at the beginning of the alphabet: N becomes A, O becomes B, and so on to Z, which becomes M. To decode a message, You apply the same substitution rules, but this time on the ROT13 encrypted text. (Any other character, for example numbers, symbols, punctuation or whitespace, are left unchanged.)

Because there are 26 letters in the Latin alphabet and 26 = 2 × 13, the ROT13 function is its own inverse:

:formula_1 for any basic Latin-alphabet text &quot;x&quot;.

In other words, two successive applications of ROT13 restore the original text (in mathematics, this is sometimes called an &quot;involution&quot;; in cryptography, a &quot;reciprocal cipher&quot;).

The transformation can be done using a lookup table, such as the following:
For example, in the following joke, the punchline has been obscured by ROT13:
: Why did the chicken cross the road?
:Gb trg gb gur bgure fvqr!

Transforming the entire text via ROT13 form, the answer to the joke is revealed:
: Jul qvq gur puvpxra pebff gur ebnq?
: To get to the other side!

A second application of ROT13 would restore the original.

==Usage==

ROT13 is not intended to be used in modern times. At the time of conception in an era of Ancient Roman technology, the encryption scheme was not represented by a mathematical structure. The key to decrypt a message requires no more knowledge than the fact that ROT13 is in use. Even if secrecy does not fail, any alien party or individual, capable of intercepting the message, could break the code by spending enough time on decoding the text through frequency analysis or finding other patterns.

In the early 80s, ROT13 was supposedly used on Usenet newsgroup servers This in an effort to hide potentially offensive jokes, or to obscure an answer to a puzzle or other spoiler, or to fool less sophisticated spam bots[&quot; – &quot;]. ROT13 has been the subject of many jokes.

The 1989 International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC) included an entry by Brian Westley. Westley&#x27;s computer program can be encoded in ROT13 or reversed and still compiles correctly. Its operation, when executed, is either to perform ROT13 encoding on, or to reverse its input.

In December 1999, it was found that Netscape Communicator used ROT13 as part of an insecure scheme to store email passwords. 

In 2001, Russian programmer Dimitry Sklyarov demonstrated that an eBook vendor, New Paradigm Research Group (NPRG), used ROT13 to encrypt their documents. It has been speculated that NPRG may have mistaken the ROT13 toy example—provided with the Adobe eBook software development kit—for a serious encryption scheme. Windows XP uses ROT13 on some of its registry keys. ROT13 is also used in the Unix fortune program to conceal potentially offensive dicta.

Johann Ernst Elias Bessler, an 18th-century clock maker and constructor of perpetual motion machines, pointed out that ROT13 encodes his surname as &quot;Orffyre&quot;. He used its latinised form, &quot;Orffyreus&quot;, as his pseudonym.

== Net culture ==
Because of its utter unsuitability for real secrecy, ROT13 has become a catchphrase to refer to any conspicuously weak encryption scheme; a critic might claim that &quot;56-bit DES is little better than ROT13 these days&quot;. In a play on real terms like &quot;double DES&quot; several terms cropped up with humorous intent:

* Double ROT13: applying ROT13 to an already ROT13-encrypted text restores the original plaintext.
* ROT26: equivalent to no encryption at all.
* 2ROT13 was included in a spoof academic paper entitled &quot;On the 2ROT13 Encryption Algorithm&quot;. 
* triple-ROT13: used jokingly in analogy with 3DES, it is equivalent to regular ROT13.
ROT13 jokes were popular on many newsgroup servers, like net.jokes as early as the 1980s.

The newsgroup alt.folklore.urban coined a word—&quot;furrfu&quot;—that was the ROT13 encoding of the frequently encoded utterance &quot;sheesh&quot;. &quot;Furrfu&quot; evolved in mid-1992 as a response to postings repeating urban myths on alt.folklore.urban, after some posters complained that &quot;Sheesh!&quot; as a response to newcomers was being overused.

Using a search engine on public social networks, yields results for ROT13 in jokes to this day.

==Letter games==
ROT13 provides an opportunity for letter games. Some words will, when transformed with ROT13, produce another word. Examples of 7-letter pairs in the English language are &quot;&quot; and &quot;nowhere&quot;, and &quot;Chechen&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Other examples of words like these are shown in the table. The pair &quot;gnat&quot; and &quot;tang&quot; is an example of words that are both ROT13 reciprocals and reversals.

==Variants and combinations==
ROT5 is a practice similar to ROT13 that applies to numeric digits (0 to 9). ROT13 and ROT5 can be used together in the same message, sometimes called ROT18 (18 = 13 + 5) or ROT13.5.

ROT47 is a derivative of ROT13 which, in addition to scrambling the basic letters, treats numbers and common symbols. Instead of using the sequence A–Z as the alphabet, ROT47 uses a larger set of characters from the common character encoding known as ASCII. Specifically, the 7-bit printable characters, excluding space, from decimal 33 &#x27;!&#x27; through 126 &#x27;~&#x27;, 94 in total, taken in the order of the numerical values of their ASCII codes, are rotated by 47 positions, without special consideration of case. For example, the character A is mapped to p, while a is mapped to 2.

The use of a larger alphabet produces a more thorough obfuscation than that of ROT13; for example, a telephone number such as +1-415-839-6885 is not obvious at first sight from the scrambled result Z&#x27;\c`d\gbh\eggd. On the other hand, because ROT47 introduces numbers and symbols into the mix without discrimination, it is more immediately obvious that the text has been encoded.

Example:
:The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.
enciphers to
:%96 &quot;F:4&lt; qC@H? u@I yF&gt;AD ~G6C %96 {2KJ s@8]

The GNU C library, a set of standard routines available for use in computer programming, contains a function—memfrob()—which has a similar purpose to ROT13, although it is intended for use with arbitrary binary data. The function operates by combining each byte with the binary pattern 00101010 (42) using the exclusive or (XOR) operation. This effects a simple XOR cipher. Like ROT13, XOR (and therefore memfrob()) is self-reciprocal, and provides a similar, virtually absent, level of security.

==Implementation==
=== tr ===
The ROT13 and ROT47 are fairly easy to implement using the Unix terminal application tr; to encrypt the string &quot;Pack My Box With Five Dozen Liquor Jugs&quot; in ROT13:

$ # Map upper case A-Z to N-ZA-M and lower case a-z to n-za-m
$ tr &#x27;A-Za-z&#x27; &#x27;N-ZA-Mn-za-m&#x27; «&lt; &quot;Pack My Box With Five Dozen Liquor Jugs&quot;
Cnpx Zl Obk Jvgu Svir Qbmra Yvdhbe Whtf
and the string &quot;The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog&quot; for ROT47:

$ echo &quot;The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog&quot; | tr &#x27;\!-~&#x27; &#x27;P-~\!-O&#x27;
%96 &quot;F:4&lt; qC@H? u@I yF&gt;AD ~G6C %96 {2KJ s@8
=== Emacs and Vim ===
In Emacs, one can ROT13 the buffer or a selection with the commands codice_1, codice_2, or codice_3.

In the Vim text editor, one can ROT13 a buffer with the command codice_4.

===Python===

The module provides text transform.
»&gt; import codecs
»&gt; print(codecs.encode(&quot;The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog&quot;, &quot;rot13&quot;))

Without importing any libraries, it can be done in a two-line list comprehension:

string = &quot;Quartz glyph job vext cwm porshrop finks?!&quot;

for abcd in [&quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot;, &quot;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&quot;]:
 string = &quot;&quot;.join([abcd[(abcd.index(char) + 13) % 26] if char in abcd else char for char in string])

print(string)

# Dhnegm tylcu wbo irkg pjz cbefuebc svaxf?!
For Python 3, you can use the method str.maketrans() 
text = &quot;this is an example without capital letters&quot;

my_rot13 = str.maketrans(
 &quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot;, &quot;nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm&quot;

print(text.translate(my_rot13))

<text>Software architecture is the set of structures needed to reason about a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems. Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations.

The &quot;architecture&quot; of a software system is a metaphor, analogous to the architecture of a building. It functions as the blueprints for the system and the development project, which project management can later use to extrapolate the tasks necessary to be executed by the teams and people involved.

Software architecture is about making fundamental structural choices that are costly to change once implemented. Software architecture choices include specific structural options from possibilities in the design of the software. There are two fundamental laws in software architecture:

# Everything is a trade-off
# &quot;Why is more important than how&quot;

&quot;Architectural Kata&quot; is a teamwork which can be used to produce an architectural solution that fits the needs. Each team extracts and prioritizes architectural characteristics (aka non functional requirements) then models the components accordingly. The team can use C4 Model which is a flexible method to model the architecture just enough. Note that synchronous communication between architectural components, entangles them and they must share the same architectural characteristics. 

Documenting software architecture facilitates communication between stakeholders, captures early decisions about the high-level design, and allows the reuse of design components between projects.

Software architecture design is commonly juxtaposed with software application design. Whilst application design focuses on the design of the processes and data supporting the required functionality (the services offered by the system), software architecture design focuses on designing the infrastructure within which application functionality can be realized and executed such that the functionality is provided in a way which meets the system&#x27;s non-functional requirements.

Software architectures can be categorized into two main types: monolith and distributed architecture, each has its own subcategories.

Software architecture tends to become more complex over time. Software architects should use &quot;fitness functions&quot; to continuously keep the architecture in check.

==Scope==
Opinions vary as to the scope of software architectures:
* Macroscopic system structure: this refers to architecture as a higher-level abstraction of a software system that consists of a collection of computational &quot;components&quot; together with &quot;connectors&quot; that describe the interaction between these components.
* The important stuff—whatever that is: this refers to the fact that software architects should concern themselves with those decisions that have high impact on the system and its stakeholders.
* That which is fundamental to understanding a system in its environment
* Things that people perceive as hard to change: since designing the architecture takes place at the beginning of a software system&#x27;s lifecycle, the architect should focus on decisions that &quot;have to&quot; be right the first time. Following this line of thought, architectural design issues may become non-architectural once their irreversibility can be overcome.
* A set of architectural design decisions: software architecture should not be considered merely a set of models or structures, but should include the decisions that lead to these particular structures, and the rationale behind them. This insight has led to substantial research into software architecture knowledge management.

There is no sharp distinction between software architecture versus design and requirements engineering (see Related fields below). They are all part of a &quot;chain of intentionality&quot; from high-level intentions to low-level details.

== Software architecture style vs. software architecture pattern ==
Software Architecture Pattern refers to a reusable, proven solution to a recurring problem at the system level, addressing concerns related to the overall structure, component interactions, and quality attributes of the system. Software architecture patterns operate at a higher level of abstraction than software design patterns, solving broader system-level challenges. While these patterns typically affect system-level concerns, the distinction between architectural patterns and architectural styles can sometimes be blurry. Examples include Circuit Breaker. 

Software Architecture Style refers to a high-level structural organization that defines the overall system organization, specifying how components are organized, how they interact, and the constraints on those interactions. Architecture styles typically include a vocabulary of component and connector types, as well as semantic models for interpreting the system&#x27;s properties. These styles represent the most coarse-grained level of system organization. Examples include Layered Architecture, Microservices, and Event-Driven Architecture. 

== Anti-patterns ==
The following architectural anti-patterns can arise when architects make decisions. These anti-patterns often follow a progressive sequence, where resolving one may lead to the emergence of another. 

* An architect may delay or avoid making architectural decisions due to the fear of choosing incorrectly. To address this, ongoing and close collaboration with the development team is often necessary, with architectural choices being adjusted based on their feedback. Additionally, decisions are typically made at the &quot;last responsible moment,&quot; ensuring there is enough information to justify and validate the decision, while avoiding unnecessary delays that could lead to analysis paralysis and hinder the team&#x27;s progress. 
* Another anti-pattern can arise when architectural decisions are forgotten, not documented, or not understood, leading to repeated discussions without resolution. This often occurs when email is used to communicate architectural decisions. To address these challenges, architects typically provide both technical and business justifications (often related to cost, user satisfaction, and time to market) in a single record of the architectural decision (usually an Architecture Decision Record). This record can be maintained in an accessible repository, such as a wiki. Communication via email focuses on the nature and context of the change and is directed only to relevant stakeholders, with a link to the centralized record. This ensures there is always a single updated source of truth. Additionally, if an architectural decision does not offer tangible business value, or if the business value is misaligned with business stakeholders, it may need to be reconsidered. 

== Characteristics ==
Software architecture exhibits the following:

Multitude of stakeholders: software systems have to cater to a variety of stakeholders such as business managers, owners, users, and operators. These stakeholders all have their own concerns with respect to the system. Balancing these concerns and demonstrating that they are addressed is part of designing the system. This implies that architecture involves dealing with a broad variety of concerns and stakeholders, and has a multidisciplinary nature.

Separation of concerns: the established way for architects to reduce complexity is to separate the concerns that drive the design. Architecture documentation shows that all stakeholder concerns are addressed by modeling and describing the architecture from separate points of view associated with the various stakeholder concerns. These separate descriptions are called architectural views (see for example the 4+1 architectural view model).

Quality-driven: classic software design approaches (e.g. Jackson Structured Programming) were driven by required functionality and the flow of data through the system, but the current insight is that the architecture of a software system is more closely related to its quality attributes such as fault-tolerance, backward compatibility, extensibility, reliability, maintainability, availability, security, usability, and other such –ilities. Stakeholder concerns often translate into requirements on these quality attributes, which are variously called non-functional requirements, extra-functional requirements, behavioral requirements, or quality attribute requirements.

Recurring styles: like building architecture, the software architecture discipline has developed standard ways to address recurring concerns. These &quot;standard ways&quot; are called by various names at various levels of abstraction. Common terms for recurring solutions are architectural style, tactic, reference architecture and architectural pattern.

Conceptual integrity: a term introduced by Fred Brooks in his 1975 book &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot; to denote the idea that the architecture of a software system represents an overall vision of what it should do and how it should do it. This vision should be separated from its implementation. The architect assumes the role of &quot;keeper of the vision&quot;, making sure that additions to the system are in line with the architecture, hence preserving conceptual integrity.

Cognitive constraints: An observation first made in a 1967 paper by computer programmer Melvin Conway that organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations. Fred Brooks introduced it to a wider audience when he cited the paper and the idea in &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;, calling it Conway&#x27;s Law.

== Motivation ==
Software architecture is an &quot;intellectually graspable&quot; abstraction of a complex system. This abstraction provides a number of benefits:
* &quot;It gives a basis for analysis of software systems&#x27; behavior before the system has been built.&quot; The ability to verify that a future software system fulfills its stakeholders&#x27; needs without actually having to build it represents substantial cost-saving and risk-mitigation. A number of techniques have been developed to perform such analyses, such as ATAM or by creating a visual representation of the software system.
* &quot;It provides a basis for re-use of elements and decisions.&quot; A complete software architecture or parts of it, like individual architectural strategies and decisions, can be re-used across multiple systems whose stakeholders require similar quality attributes or functionality, saving design costs and mitigating the risk of design mistakes.
* &quot;It supports early design decisions that impact a system&#x27;s development, deployment, and maintenance life.&quot; Getting the early, high-impact decisions right is important to prevent schedule and budget overruns.
* &quot;It facilitates communication with stakeholders, contributing to a system that better fulfills their needs.&quot; Communicating about complex systems from the point of view of stakeholders helps them understand the consequences of their stated requirements and the design decisions based on them. Architecture gives the ability to communicate about design decisions before the system is implemented, when they are still relatively easy to adapt.
* &quot;It helps in risk management.&quot; Software architecture helps to reduce risks and chance of failure.
* &quot;It enables cost reduction.&quot; Software architecture is a means to manage risk and costs in complex IT projects.

==History==
The comparison between software design and (civil) architecture was first drawn in the late 1960s, but the term &quot;software architecture&quot; did not see widespread usage until the 1990s. The field of computer science had encountered problems associated with complexity since its formation. Earlier problems of complexity were solved by developers by choosing the right data structures, developing algorithms, and by applying the concept of separation of concerns. Although the term &quot;software architecture&quot; is relatively new to the industry, the fundamental principles of the field have been applied sporadically by software engineering pioneers since the mid-1980s. Early attempts to capture and explain software architecture of a system were imprecise and disorganized, often characterized by a set of box-and-line diagrams.

Software architecture as a concept has its origins in the research of Edsger Dijkstra in 1968 and David Parnas in the early 1970s. These scientists emphasized that the structure of a software system matters and getting the structure right is critical. During the 1990s there was a concerted effort to define and codify fundamental aspects of the discipline, with research work concentrating on architectural styles (patterns), architecture description languages, architecture documentation, and formal methods.

Research institutions have played a prominent role in furthering software architecture as a discipline. Mary Shaw and David Garlan of Carnegie Mellon wrote a book titled &quot;Software Architecture: Perspectives on an Emerging Discipline&quot; in 1996, which promoted software architecture concepts such as components, connectors, and styles. The University of California, Irvine&#x27;s Institute for Software Research&#x27;s efforts in software architecture research is directed primarily in architectural styles, architecture description languages, and dynamic architectures.

IEEE 1471-2000, &quot;Recommended Practice for Architecture Description of Software-Intensive Systems&quot;, was the first formal standard in the area of software architecture. It was adopted in 2007 by ISO as ISO/IEC 42010:2007. In November 2011, IEEE 1471–2000 was superseded by ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011, &quot;Systems and software engineering – Architecture description&quot; (jointly published by IEEE and ISO).

While in IEEE 1471, software architecture was about the architecture of &quot;software-intensive systems&quot;, defined as &quot;any system where software contributes essential influences to the design, construction, deployment, and evolution of the system as a whole&quot;, the 2011 edition goes a step further by including the ISO/IEC 15288 and ISO/IEC 12207 definitions of a system, which embrace not only hardware and software, but also &quot;humans, processes, procedures, facilities, materials and naturally occurring entities&quot;. This reflects the relationship between software architecture, enterprise architecture and solution architecture.

==Architecture activities==

Making architectural decisions involves collecting sufficient relevant information, providing justification for the decision, documenting the decision and its rationale, and communicating it effectively to the appropriate stakeholders. 

It&#x27;s software architect&#x27;s responsibility to match architectural characteristics (aka non-functional requirements) with business requirements. For example: 

* Having a high customer satisfactions requires availability, fault tolerance, security, testability, recoverability, agility and performance in the system.
* Doing mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) requires extensibility, scalability, adaptability, and interoperability
* Constrained budget and time requires feasibility and simplicity
* Faster time-to-market requires maintainability, testability and deployability.

There are four core activities in software architecture design. These core architecture activities are performed iteratively and at different stages of the initial software development life-cycle, as well as over the evolution of a system.

Architectural analysis is the process of understanding the environment in which a proposed system will operate and determining the requirements for the system. The input or requirements to the analysis activity can come from any number of stakeholders and include items such as:

* what the system will do when operational (the functional requirements)
* how well the system will perform runtime non-functional requirements such as reliability, operability, performance efficiency, security, compatibility defined in ISO/IEC 25010:2011 standard 
* development-time of non-functional requirements such as maintainability and transferability defined in ISO 25010:2011 standard 
* business requirements and environmental contexts of a system that may change over time, such as legal, social, financial, competitive, and technology concerns

The outputs of the analysis activity are those requirements that have a measurable impact on a software system&#x27;s architecture, called architecturally significant requirements.

Architectural synthesis or design is the process of creating an architecture. Given the architecturally significant requirements determined by the analysis, the current state of the design and the results of any evaluation activities, the design is created and improved.

Architecture evaluation is the process of determining how well the current design or a portion of it satisfies the requirements derived during analysis. An evaluation can occur whenever an architect is considering a design decision, it can occur after some portion of the design has been completed, it can occur after the final design has been completed or it can occur after the system has been constructed. Some of the available software architecture evaluation techniques include Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) and TARA. Frameworks for comparing the techniques are discussed in frameworks such as &quot;SARA Report&quot; and &quot;Architecture Reviews: Practice and Experience&quot;.

Architecture evolution is the process of maintaining and adapting an existing software architecture to meet changes in requirements and environment. As software architecture provides a fundamental structure of a software system, its evolution and maintenance would necessarily impact its fundamental structure. As such, architecture evolution is concerned with adding new functionality as well as maintaining existing functionality and system behavior.

Architecture requires critical supporting activities. These supporting activities take place throughout the core software architecture process. They include knowledge management and communication, design reasoning and decision-making, and documentation.

=== Architecture supporting activities ===
Software architecture supporting activities are carried out during core software architecture activities. These supporting activities assist a software architect to carry out analysis, synthesis, evaluation, and evolution. For instance, an architect has to gather knowledge, make decisions, and document during the analysis phase.

* Knowledge management and communication is the act of exploring and managing knowledge that is essential to designing a software architecture. A software architect does not work in isolation. They get inputs, functional and non-functional requirements, and design contexts, from various stakeholders; and provide outputs to stakeholders. Software architecture knowledge is often tacit and is retained in the heads of stakeholders. Software architecture knowledge management activity is about finding, communicating, and retaining knowledge. As software architecture design issues are intricate and interdependent, a knowledge gap in design reasoning can lead to incorrect software architecture design. Examples of knowledge management and communication activities include searching for design patterns, prototyping, asking experienced developers and architects, evaluating the designs of similar systems, sharing knowledge with other designers and stakeholders, and documenting experience on a wiki page.
* Design reasoning and decision making is the activity of evaluating design decisions. This activity is fundamental to all three core software architecture activities. It entails gathering and associating decision contexts, formulating design decision problems, finding solution options and evaluating tradeoffs before making decisions. This process occurs at different levels of decision granularity while evaluating significant architectural requirements and software architecture decisions, and software architecture analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Examples of reasoning activities include understanding the impacts of a requirement or a design on quality attributes, questioning the issues that a design might cause, assessing possible solution options, and evaluating the tradeoffs between solutions.
* Documentation is the act of recording the design generated during the software architecture process. System design is described using several views that frequently include a static view showing the code structure of the system, a dynamic view showing the actions of the system during execution, and a deployment view showing how a system is placed on hardware for execution. Kruchten&#x27;s 4+1 view suggests a description of commonly used views for documenting software architecture; &quot;Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond&quot; has descriptions of the kinds of notations that could be used within the view description. Examples of documentation activities are writing a specification, recording a system design model, documenting a design rationale, developing a viewpoint, documenting views.

== Software Architecture Design Strategies ==
Software architecture inherently deals with uncertainties, and the size of architectural components can significantly influence a system&#x27;s outcomes, both positively and negatively. Neal Ford and Mark Richards propose an iterative approach to address the challenge of identifying and right-sizing components. This method emphasizes continuous refinement as teams develop a more nuanced understanding of system behavior and requirements. 

The approach typically involves a cycle with several stages: 

* A high-level partitioning strategy is established, often categorized as technical or domain-based. Guidelines for the smallest meaningful deployable unit, referred to as &quot;quanta,&quot; are defined. While these foundational decisions are made early, they may be revisited later in the cycle if necessary.
* Initial components are identified based on the established strategy.
* Requirements are assigned to the identified components.
* The roles and responsibilities of each component are analyzed to ensure clarity and minimize overlap.
* Architectural characteristics, such as scalability, fault tolerance, and maintainability, are evaluated.
* Components may be restructured based on feedback from development teams.

This cycle serves as a general framework and can be adapted to different domains.

== Software architecture topics ==

=== Software architecture and agile development ===
There are also concerns that software architecture leads to too much big design up front, especially among proponents of agile software development. A number of methods have been developed to balance the trade-offs of up-front design and agility, including the agile method DSDM which mandates a &quot;Foundations&quot; phase during which &quot;just enough&quot; architectural foundations are laid. &quot;IEEE Software&quot; devoted a special issue to the interaction between agility and architecture.

=== Software architecture erosion ===
Software architecture erosion refers to a gradual gap between the intended and implemented architecture of a software system over time. The phenomenon of software architecture erosion was initially brought to light in 1992 by Perry and Wolf alongside their definition of software architecture.

Software architecture erosion may occur in each stage of the software development life cycle and has varying impacts on the development speed and the cost of maintenance. Software architecture erosion occurs due to various reasons, such as &quot;architectural violations&quot;, &quot;the accumulation of technical debt&quot;, and &quot;knowledge vaporization&quot;. A famous case of architecture erosion is the failure of Mozilla Web browser. Mozilla is an application created by Netscape with a complex codebase that became harder to maintain due to continuous changes. Due to initial poor design and growing architecture erosion, Netscape spent two years redeveloping the Mozilla Web browser, demonstrating the importance of proactive architecture management to prevent costly repairs and project delays.

Architecture erosion can decrease software performance, substantially increase evolutionary costs, and degrade software quality. Various approaches and tools have been proposed to detect architecture erosion. These approaches are primarily classified into four categories: consistency-based, evolution-based, defect-based, and decision-based approaches. For instance, automated architecture conformance checks, static code analysis tools, and refactoring techniques help identify and mitigate erosion early.

Besides, the measures used to address architecture erosion contain two main types: preventative and remedial measures. Preventative measures include enforcing architectural rules, regular code reviews, and automated testing, while remedial measures involve refactoring, redesign, and documentation updates.

=== Software architecture recovery ===
Software architecture recovery (or reconstruction, or reverse engineering) includes the methods, techniques, and processes to uncover a software system&#x27;s architecture from available information, including its implementation and documentation. Architecture recovery is often necessary to make informed decisions in the face of obsolete or out-of-date documentation and 
architecture erosion: implementation and maintenance decisions diverging from the envisioned architecture. Practices exist to recover software architecture as static program analysis. This is a part of the subjects covered by the software intelligence practice.

==Related fields==

=== Design ===

Architecture is design but not all design is architectural. In practice, the architect is the one who draws the line between software architecture (architectural design) and detailed design (non-architectural design). There are no rules or guidelines that fit all cases, although there have been attempts to formalize the distinction. 
According to the &quot;Intension/Locality Hypothesis&quot;, the distinction between architectural and detailed design is defined by the &quot;Locality Criterion&quot;, according to which a statement about software design is non-local (architectural) if and only if a program that satisfies it can be expanded into a program that does not. For example, the client–server style is architectural (strategic) because a program that is built on this principle can be expanded into a program that is not client–server—for example, by adding peer-to-peer nodes.

=== Requirements engineering ===

Requirements engineering and software architecture can be seen as complementary approaches: while software architecture targets the &#x27;solution space&#x27; or the &#x27;how&#x27;, requirements engineering addresses the &#x27;problem space&#x27; or the &#x27;what&#x27;. Requirements engineering entails the elicitation, negotiation, specification, validation, documentation, and management of requirements. Both requirements engineering and software architecture revolve around stakeholder concerns, needs, and wishes.

There is considerable overlap between requirements engineering and software architecture, as evidenced for example by a study into five industrial software architecture methods that concludes that &quot;the inputs (goals, constraints, etc.) are usually ill-defined, and only get discovered or better understood as the architecture starts to emerge&quot; and that while &quot;most architectural concerns are expressed as requirements on the system, they can also include mandated design decisions&quot;. In short, required behavior impacts solution architecture, which in turn may introduce new requirements. Approaches such as the Twin Peaks model aim to exploit the synergistic relation between requirements and architecture.

=== Other types of &#x27;architecture&#x27; ===
;Computer architecture 
:Computer architecture targets the internal structure of a computer system, in terms of collaborating hardware components such as the CPU – or processor – the bus and the memory.

;Serverless architecture
:Serverless architecture is a cloud computing paradigm that is often misunderstood as being server-free. It essentially shifts server management responsibilities from developers to cloud service providers. This allows businesses to run their backend code on cloud infrastructure, eliminating the need for physical server management. The event-driven approach of serverless architecture relies on small, task-specific functions that are executed on-demand. These functions are known as Function as a Service (FaaS), and they offer cost-efficiency through a pay-as-you-go billing model and dynamic resource scaling based on application demand.

;Systems architecture
:The term systems architecture has originally been applied to the architecture of systems that consist of both hardware and software. The main concern addressed by the systems architecture is then the integration of software and hardware in a complete, correctly working device. In another common – much broader – meaning, the term applies to the architecture of any complex system which may be of a technical, sociotechnical or social nature.

;Enterprise architecture
:The goal of enterprise architecture is to &quot;translate business vision and strategy into effective enterprise&quot;. Enterprise architecture frameworks, such as TOGAF and the Zachman Framework, usually distinguish between different enterprise architecture layers. Although terminology differs from framework to framework, many include at least a distinction between a &quot;business layer&quot;, an &quot;application&quot; (or &quot;information&quot;) &quot;layer&quot;, and a &quot;technology layer&quot;. Enterprise architecture addresses among others the alignment between these layers, usually in a top-down approach.

<text>Polyurethane (; often abbreviated PUR and PU) refers to a class of polymers composed of organic units joined by carbamate (urethane) links. In contrast to other common polymers such as polyethylene and polystyrene, polyurethane term does not refer to the single type of polymer but a group of polymers. Unlike polyethylene and polystyrene polyurethanes can be produced from a wide range of starting materials resulting various polymers within the same group. This chemical variety produces polyurethanes with different chemical structures leading to many different applications. These include rigid and flexible foams, and coatings, adhesives, electrical potting compounds, and fibers such as spandex and polyurethane laminate (PUL). Foams are the largest application accounting for 67% of all polyurethane produced in 2016.

A polyurethane is typically produced by reacting a polymeric isocyanate with a polyol. Since a polyurethane contains two types of monomers, which polymerize one after the other, they are classed as alternating copolymers. Both the isocyanates and polyols used to make a polyurethane contain two or more functional groups per molecule.

Global production in 2019 was 25 million metric tonnes, accounting for about 6% of all polymers produced in that year.

==History==
Otto Bayer and his coworkers at IG Farben in Leverkusen, Germany, first made polyurethanes in 1937. The new polymers had some advantages over existing plastics that were made by polymerizing olefins or by polycondensation, and were not covered by patents obtained by Wallace Carothers on polyesters. Early work focused on the production of fibers and flexible foams and PUs were applied on a limited scale as aircraft coating during World War II. Polyisocyanates became commercially available in 1952, and production of flexible polyurethane foam began in 1954 by combining toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and polyester polyols. These materials were also used to produce rigid foams, gum rubber, and elastomers. Linear fibers were produced from hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and 1,4-Butanediol (BDO).

DuPont introduced polyethers, specifically poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol, in 1956. BASF and Dow Chemical introduced polyalkylene glycols in 1957. Polyether polyols were cheaper, easier to handle and more water-resistant than polyester polyols. Union Carbide and Mobay, a U.S. Monsanto/Bayer joint venture, also began making polyurethane chemicals. In 1960 more than 45,000 metric tons of flexible polyurethane foams were produced. The availability of chlorofluoroalkane blowing agents, inexpensive polyether polyols, and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) allowed polyurethane rigid foams to be used as high-performance insulation materials. In 1967, urethane-modified polyisocyanurate rigid foams were introduced, offering even better thermal stability and flammability resistance. During the 1960s, automotive interior safety components, such as instrument and door panels, were produced by back-filling thermoplastic skins with semi-rigid foam.

In 1969, Bayer exhibited an all-plastic car in Düsseldorf, Germany. Parts of this car, such as the fascia and body panels, were manufactured using a new process called reaction injection molding (RIM), in which the reactants were mixed and then injected into a mold. The addition of fillers, such as milled glass, mica, and processed mineral fibers, gave rise to reinforced RIM (RRIM), which provided improvements in flexural modulus (stiffness), reduction in coefficient of thermal expansion and better thermal stability. This technology was used to make the first plastic-body automobile in the United States, the Pontiac Fiero, in 1983. Further increases in stiffness were obtained by incorporating pre-placed glass mats into the RIM mold cavity, also known broadly as resin injection molding, or structural RIM.

Starting in the early 1980s, water-blown microcellular flexible foams were used to mold gaskets for automotive panels and air-filter seals, replacing PVC polymers. Polyurethane foams are used in many automotive applications including seating, head and arm rests, and headliners. 

Polyurethane foam (including foam rubber) is sometimes made using small amounts of blowing agents to give less dense foam, better cushioning/energy absorption or thermal insulation. In the early 1990s, because of their impact on ozone depletion, the Montreal Protocol restricted the use of many chlorine-containing blowing agents, such as trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11). By the late 1990s, blowing agents such as carbon dioxide, pentane, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a) and 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HFC-245fa) were widely used in North America and the EU, although chlorinated blowing agents remained in use in many developing countries. Later, HFC-134a was also banned due to high ODP and GWP readings, and HFC-141B was introduced in early 2000s as an alternate blowing agent in developing nations.

==Chemistry==
Polyurethanes are produced by reacting diisocyanates with polyols, often in the presence of a catalyst, or upon exposure to ultraviolet radiation. 
Common catalysts include tertiary amines, such as DABCO, DMDEE, or metallic soaps, such as dibutyltin dilaurate. The stoichiometry of the starting materials must be carefully controlled as excess isocyanate can trimerise, leading to the formation of rigid polyisocyanurates. The polymer usually has a highly crosslinked molecular structure, resulting in a thermosetting material which does not melt on heating; although some thermoplastic polyurethanes are also produced.

The most common application of polyurethane is as solid foams, which requires the presence of a gas, or blowing agent, during the polymerization step. This is commonly achieved by adding small amounts of water, which reacts with isocyanates to form CO2 gas and an amine, via an unstable carbamic acid group. The amine produced can also react with isocyanates to form urea groups, and as such the polymer will contain both these and urethane linkers. The urea is not very soluble in the reaction mixture and tends to form separate &quot;hard segment&quot; phases consisting mostly of polyurea. The concentration and organization of these polyurea phases can have a significant impact on the properties of the foam.

The type of foam produced can be controlled by regulating the amount of blowing agent and also by the addition of various surfactants which change the rheology of the polymerising mixture. Foams can be either &quot;closed-cell&quot;, where most of the original bubbles or cells remain intact, or &quot;open-cell&quot;, where the bubbles have broken but the edges of the bubbles are stiff enough to retain their shape, in extreme cases reticulated foams can be formed. Open-cell foams feel soft and allow air to flow through, so they are comfortable when used in seat cushions or mattresses. Closed-cell foams are used as rigid thermal insulation. High-density microcellular foams can be formed without the addition of blowing agents by mechanically frothing the polyol prior to use. These are tough elastomeric materials used in covering car steering wheels or shoe soles. 

The properties of a polyurethane are greatly influenced by the types of isocyanates and polyols used to make it. Long, flexible segments, contributed by the polyol, give soft, elastic polymer. High amounts of crosslinking give tough or rigid polymers. Long chains and low crosslinking give a polymer that is very stretchy, short chains with many crosslinks produce a hard polymer while long chains and intermediate crosslinking give a polymer useful for making foam. The choices available for the isocyanates and polyols, in addition to other additives and processing conditions allow polyurethanes to have the very wide range of properties that make them such widely used polymers.

==Raw materials==
The main ingredients to make a polyurethane are di- and tri-isocyanates and polyols. Other materials are added to aid processing the polymer or to modify the properties of the polymer. PU foam formulation sometimes have water added too. 

===Isocyanates===
Isocyanates used to make polyurethane have two or more isocyanate groups on each molecule. The most commonly used isocyanates are the aromatic diisocyanates, toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, (MDI). These aromatic isocyanates are more reactive than aliphatic isocyanates.

TDI and MDI are generally less expensive and more reactive than other isocyanates. Industrial grade TDI and MDI are mixtures of isomers and MDI often contains polymeric materials. They are used to make flexible foam (for example slabstock foam for mattresses or molded foams for car seats), rigid foam (for example insulating foam in refrigerators) elastomers (shoe soles, for example), and so on. The isocyanates may be modified by partially reacting them with polyols or introducing some other materials to reduce volatility (and hence toxicity) of the isocyanates, decrease their freezing points to make handling easier or to improve the properties of the final polymers.

Aliphatic and cycloaliphatic isocyanates are used in smaller quantities, most often in coatings and other applications where color and transparency are important since polyurethanes made with aromatic isocyanates tend to darken on exposure to light.{{page needed|date=August 2023}} The most important aliphatic and cycloaliphatic isocyanates are 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), 1-isocyanato-3-isocyanatomethyl-3,5,5-trimethyl-cyclohexane (isophorone diisocyanate, IPDI), and 4,4′-diisocyanato dicyclohexylmethane (H12MDI or hydrogenated MDI). Other more specialized isocyanates include Tetramethylxylylene diisocyanate (TMXDI).

===Polyols===
{{main|Polyol}}
Polyols are polymers in their own right and have on average two or more hydroxyl groups per molecule. They can be converted to polyether polyols by co-polymerizing ethylene oxide and propylene oxide with a suitable polyol precursor. Polyester polyols are made by the polycondensation of multifunctional carboxylic acids and polyhydroxyl compounds. They can be further classified according to their end use. Higher molecular weight polyols (molecular weights from 2,000 to 10,000) are used to make more flexible polyurethanes while lower molecular weight polyols make more rigid products.

Polyols for flexible applications use low functionality initiators such as dipropylene glycol (&quot;f&quot; = 2), glycerine (&quot;f&quot; = 3), or a sorbitol/water solution (&quot;f&quot; = 2.75). Polyols for rigid applications use higher functionality initiators such as sucrose (&quot;f&quot; = 8), sorbitol (&quot;f&quot; = 6), toluenediamine (&quot;f&quot; = 4), and Mannich bases (&quot;f&quot; = 4). Propylene oxide and/or ethylene oxide is added to the initiators until the desired molecular weight is achieved. The order of addition and the amounts of each oxide affect many polyol properties, such as compatibility, water-solubility, and reactivity. Polyols made with only propylene oxide are terminated with secondary hydroxyl groups and are less reactive than polyols capped with ethylene oxide, which contain primary hydroxyl groups. Incorporating carbon dioxide into the polyol structure is being researched by multiple companies. 

Graft polyols (also called filled polyols or polymer polyols) contain finely dispersed styrene–acrylonitrile, acrylonitrile, or polyurea (PHD) polymer solids chemically grafted to a high molecular weight polyether backbone. They are used to increase the load-bearing properties of low-density high-resiliency (HR) foam, as well as add toughness to microcellular foams and cast elastomers. Initiators such as ethylenediamine and triethanolamine are used to make low molecular weight rigid foam polyols that have built-in catalytic activity due to the presence of nitrogen atoms in the backbone. A special class of polyether polyols, poly(tetramethylene ether) glycols, which are made by polymerizing tetrahydrofuran, are used in high performance coating, wetting and elastomer applications.

Conventional polyester polyols are based on virgin raw materials and are manufactured by the direct polyesterification of high-purity diacids and glycols, such as adipic acid and 1,4-butanediol. Polyester polyols are usually more expensive and more viscous than polyether polyols, but they make polyurethanes with better solvent, abrasion, and cut resistance. Other polyester polyols are based on reclaimed raw materials. They are manufactured by transesterification (glycolysis) of recycled poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET) or dimethylterephthalate (DMT) distillation bottoms with glycols such as diethylene glycol. These low molecular weight, aromatic polyester polyols are used in rigid foam, and bring low cost and excellent flammability characteristics to polyisocyanurate (PIR) boardstock and polyurethane spray foam insulation.

Specialty polyols include polycarbonate polyols, polycaprolactone polyols, polybutadiene polyols, and polysulfide polyols. The materials are used in elastomer, sealant, and adhesive applications that require superior weatherability, and resistance to chemical and environmental attack. Natural oil polyols derived from castor oil and other vegetable oils are used to make elastomers, flexible bunstock, and flexible molded foam.

Co-polymerizing chlorotrifluoroethylene or tetrafluoroethylene with vinyl ethers containing hydroxyalkyl vinyl ether produces fluorinated (FEVE) polyols. Two-component fluorinated polyurethanes prepared by reacting FEVE fluorinated polyols with polyisocyanate have been used to make ambient cure paints and coatings. Since fluorinated polyurethanes contain a high percentage of fluorine–carbon bonds, which are the strongest bonds among all chemical bonds, fluorinated polyurethanes exhibit resistance to UV, acids, alkali, salts, chemicals, solvents, weathering, corrosion, fungi and microbial attack. These have been used for high performance coatings and paints.

Phosphorus-containing polyols are available that become chemically bonded to the polyurethane matrix for the use as flame retardants. This covalent linkage prevents migration and leaching of the organophosphorus compound.

===Bio-derived materials===
Interest in sustainable &quot;green&quot; products raised interest in polyols derived from vegetable oils. Various oils used in the preparation polyols for polyurethanes include soybean oil, cottonseed oil, neem seed oil, and castor oil. Vegetable oils are functionalized in various ways and modified to polyetheramides, polyethers, alkyds, etc. Renewable sources used to prepare polyols may be fatty acids or dimer fatty acids. Some biobased and isocyanate-free polyurethanes exploit the reaction between polyamines and cyclic carbonates to produce polyhydroxyurethanes.

===Chain extenders and cross linkers===
Chain extenders (&quot;f&quot; = 2) and cross linkers (&quot;f&quot; ≥ 3) are low molecular weight hydroxyl and amine terminated compounds that play an important role in the polymer morphology of polyurethane fibers, elastomers, adhesives, and certain integral skin and microcellular foams. The elastomeric properties of these materials are derived from the phase separation of the hard and soft copolymer segments of the polymer, such that the urethane hard segment domains serve as cross-links between the amorphous polyether (or polyester) soft segment domains. This phase separation occurs because the mainly nonpolar, low melting soft segments are incompatible with the polar, high melting hard segments. The soft segments, which are formed from high molecular weight polyols, are mobile and are normally present in coiled formation, while the hard segments, which are formed from the isocyanate and chain extenders, are stiff and immobile. As the hard segments are covalently coupled to the soft segments, they inhibit plastic flow of the polymer chains, thus creating elastomeric resiliency. Upon mechanical deformation, a portion of the soft segments are stressed by uncoiling, and the hard segments become aligned in the stress direction. This reorientation of the hard segments and consequent powerful hydrogen bonding contributes to high tensile strength, elongation, and tear resistance values.
The choice of chain extender also determines flexural, heat, and chemical resistance properties. The most important chain extenders are ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO or BDO), 1,6-hexanediol, cyclohexane dimethanol and hydroquinone bis(2-hydroxyethyl) ether (HQEE). All of these glycols form polyurethanes that phase separate well and form well defined hard segment domains, and are melt processable. They are all suitable for thermoplastic polyurethanes with the exception of ethylene glycol, since its derived bis-phenyl urethane undergoes unfavorable degradation at high hard segment levels. Diethanolamine and triethanolamine are used in flex molded foams to build firmness and add catalytic activity. Diethyltoluenediamine is used extensively in RIM, and in polyurethane and polyurea elastomer formulations.

===Catalysts===
{{main|catalyst}}
Polyurethane catalysts can be classified into two broad categories, basic and acidic amine. Tertiary amine catalysts function by enhancing the nucleophilicity of the diol component. Alkyl tin carboxylates, oxides and mercaptides oxides function as mild Lewis acids in accelerating the formation of polyurethane. As bases, traditional amine catalysts include triethylenediamine (TEDA, also called DABCO, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), dimethylcyclohexylamine (DMCHA), dimethylethanolamine (DMEA), Dimethylaminoethoxyethanol and bis-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)ether, a blowing catalyst also called A-99. A typical Lewis acidic catalyst is dibutyltin dilaurate. The process is highly sensitive to the nature of the catalyst and is also known to be autocatalytic.

Factors affecting catalyst selection include balancing three reactions: urethane (polyol+isocyanate, or gel) formation, the urea (water+isocyanate, or &quot;blow&quot;) formation, or the isocyanate trimerization reaction (e.g., using potassium acetate, to form isocyanurate rings). A variety of specialized catalysts have been developed.

===Surfactants===
{{main|surfactant}}
Surfactants are used to modify the characteristics of both foam and non-foam polyurethane polymers. They take the form of polydimethylsiloxane-polyoxyalkylene block copolymers, silicone oils, nonylphenol ethoxylates, and other organic compounds. In foams, they are used to emulsify the liquid components, regulate cell size, and stabilize the cell structure to prevent collapse and sub-surface voids. In non-foam applications they are used as air release and antifoaming agents, as wetting agents, and are used to eliminate surface defects such as pin holes, orange peel, and sink marks.

==Production==
Polyurethanes are produced by mixing two or more liquid streams. The polyol stream contains catalysts, surfactants, blowing agents (when making polyurethane foam insulation) and so on. The two components are referred to as a polyurethane system, or simply a system. The isocyanate is commonly referred to in North America as the &#x27;A-side&#x27; or just the &#x27;iso&#x27;. The blend of polyols and other additives is commonly referred to as the &#x27;B-side&#x27; or as the &#x27;poly&#x27;.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} This mixture might also be called a &#x27;resin&#x27; or &#x27;resin blend&#x27;. In Europe the meanings for &#x27;A-side&#x27; and &#x27;B-side&#x27; are reversed.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Resin blend additives may include chain extenders, cross linkers, surfactants, flame retardants, blowing agents, pigments, and fillers. Polyurethane can be made in a variety of densities and hardnesses by varying the isocyanate, polyol or additives.

==Health and safety==
Fully reacted polyurethane polymer is chemically . No exposure limits have been established in the U.S. by OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) or ACGIH (American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists). It is not regulated by OSHA for carcinogenicity.

Polyurethanes are combustible. Decomposition from fire can produce significant amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide, in addition to nitrogen oxides, isocyanates, and other toxic products. Due to the flammability of the material, it has to be treated with flame retardants (at least in case of furniture), almost all of which are considered harmful. California later issued Technical Bulletin 117 2013 which allowed most polyurethane foam to pass flammability tests without the use of flame retardants. Green Science Policy Institute states: &quot;Although the new standard can be met without flame retardants, it does NOT ban their 
use. Consumers who wish to reduce household exposure to flame retardants can look for a TB117-2013 tag on furniture, and verify with retailers that products do not contain flame retardants.&quot;

Liquid resin blends and isocyanates may contain hazardous or regulated components. Isocyanates are known skin and respiratory sensitizers. Additionally, amines, glycols, and phosphate present in spray polyurethane foams present risks.

Exposure to chemicals that may be emitted during or after application of polyurethane spray foam (such as isocyanates) are harmful to human health and therefore special precautions are required during and after this process.

In the United States, additional health and safety information can be found through organizations such as the Polyurethane Manufacturers Association (PMA) and the Center for the Polyurethanes Industry (CPI), as well as from polyurethane system and raw material manufacturers. Regulatory information can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 (Food and Drugs) and Title 40 (Protection of the Environment). In Europe, health and safety information is available from ISOPA, the European Diisocyanate and Polyol Producers Association.

==Manufacturing==
The methods of manufacturing polyurethane finished goods range from small, hand pour piece-part operations to large, high-volume bunstock and boardstock production lines. Regardless of the end-product, the manufacturing principle is the same: to meter the liquid isocyanate and resin blend at a specified stoichiometric ratio, mix them together until a homogeneous blend is obtained, dispense the reacting liquid into a mold or on to a surface, wait until it cures, then demold the finished part.

===Dispensing equipment===
Although the capital outlay can be high, it is desirable to use a meter-mix or dispense unit for even low-volume production operations that require a steady output of finished parts. Dispense equipment consists of material holding (day) tanks, metering pumps, a mix head, and a control unit. Often, a conditioning or heater–chiller unit is added to control material temperature in order to improve mix efficiency, cure rate, and to reduce process variability. Choice of dispense equipment components depends on shot size, throughput, material characteristics such as viscosity and filler content, and process control. Material day tanks may be single to hundreds of gallons in size and may be supplied directly from drums, IBCs (intermediate bulk containers, such as caged IBC totes), or bulk storage tanks. They may incorporate level sensors, conditioning jackets, and mixers. Pumps can be sized to meter in single grams per second up to hundreds of pounds per minute. They can be rotary, gear, or piston pumps, or can be specially hardened lance pumps to meter liquids containing highly abrasive fillers such as chopped or hammer-milled glass fiber and wollastonite.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

The pumps can drive low-pressure (10 to 30 bar, 1 to 3 MPa) or high-pressure (125 to 250 bar, 12.5 to 25.0 MPa) dispense systems. Mix heads can be simple static mix tubes, rotary-element mixers, low-pressure dynamic mixers, or high-pressure hydraulically actuated direct impingement mixers. Control units may have basic on/off and dispense/stop switches, and analogue pressure and temperature gauges, or may be computer-controlled with flow meters to electronically calibrate mix ratio, digital temperature and level sensors, and a full suite of statistical process control software. Add-ons to dispense equipment include nucleation or gas injection units, and third or fourth stream capability for adding pigments or metering in supplemental additive packages.

===Tooling===
Distinct from pour-in-place, bun and boardstock, and coating applications, the production of piece parts requires tooling to contain and form the reacting liquid.
The choice of mold-making material is dependent on the expected number of uses to end-of-life (EOL), molding pressure, flexibility, and heat transfer characteristics.

RTV silicone is used for tooling that has an EOL in the thousands of parts. It is typically used for molding rigid foam parts, where the ability to stretch and peel the mold around undercuts is needed.
The heat transfer characteristic of RTV silicone tooling is poor. High-performance, flexible polyurethane elastomers are also used in this way.

Epoxy, metal-filled epoxy, and metal-coated epoxy is used for tooling that has an EOL in the tens of thousands of parts. It is typically used for molding flexible foam cushions and seating, integral skin and microcellular foam padding, and shallow-draft RIM bezels and fascia. The heat transfer characteristic of epoxy tooling is fair; the heat transfer characteristic of metal-filled and metal-coated epoxy is good. Copper tubing can be incorporated into the body of the tool, allowing hot water to circulate and heat the mold surface.

Aluminum is used for tooling that has an EOL in the hundreds of thousands of parts. It is typically used for molding microcellular foam gasketing and cast elastomer parts, and is milled or extruded into shape.

Mirror-finish stainless steel is used for tooling that imparts a glossy appearance to the finished part. The heat transfer characteristic of metal tooling is excellent.

Finally, molded or milled polypropylene is used to create low-volume tooling for molded gasket applications. Instead of many expensive metal molds, low-cost plastic tooling can be formed from a single metal master, which also allows greater design flexibility. The heat transfer characteristic of polypropylene tooling is poor, which must be taken into consideration during the formulation process.

==Applications==
{{main|List of polyurethane applications|Varnish#Polyurethane|l2=Polyurethane varnish}}

In 2007, the global consumption of polyurethane raw materials was above 12 million metric tons, and the average annual growth rate was about 5%. Revenues generated with PUR on the global market are expected to rise to approximately US$75 billion by 2022. As they are such an important class of materials, research is constantly taking place and papers published.

==Degradation and environmental fate==
===Effects of visible light===
{{Wikinews|Polyurethane plastic substitute can biodegrade in seawater, say scientists}}
Polyurethanes, especially those made using aromatic isocyanates, contain chromophores that interact with light. This is of particular interest in the area of polyurethane coatings, where light stability is a critical factor and is the main reason that aliphatic isocyanates are used in making polyurethane coatings. When PU foam, which is made using aromatic isocyanates, is exposed to visible light, it discolors, turning from off-white to yellow to reddish brown. It has been generally accepted that apart from yellowing, visible light has little effect on foam properties. This is especially the case if the yellowing happens on the outer portions of a large foam, as the deterioration of properties in the outer portion has little effect on the overall bulk properties of the foam itself.

It has been reported that exposure to visible light can affect the variability of some physical property test results.

Higher-energy UV radiation promotes chemical reactions in foam, some of which are detrimental to the foam structure.

===Hydrolysis and biodegradation===
Polyurethanes may degrade due to hydrolysis. This is a common problem with shoes left in a closet, and reacting with moisture in the air.

Microbial degradation of polyurethane is believed to be due to the action of esterase, urethanase, hydrolase and protease enzymes. The process is slow as most microbes have difficulty moving beyond the surface of the polymer. Susceptibility to fungi is higher due to their release of extracellular enzymes, which are better able to permeate the polymer matrix. Two species of the Ecuadorian fungus &quot;Pestalotiopsis&quot; are capable of biodegrading polyurethane in aerobic and anaerobic conditions such as found at the bottom of landfills. Degradation of polyurethane items at museums has been reported. Polyester-type polyurethanes are more easily biodegraded by fungus than polyether-type.

<doc id="48367" wikidata="Q54066" url="?curid=48367" title="Westchester County, New York">
<text>Westchester County is a county located in the southeastern portion of the U.S. state of New York, bordering the Long Island Sound to its east and the Hudson River on its west. The county is the seventh most populous county in the State of New York and the most populous north of New York City. According to the 2020 United States census, the county had a population of 1,004,456, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 55,344 (5.8%) from the 949,113 counted in 2010. Westchester covers an area of , consisting of six cities, 19 towns, and 23 villages. Established in 1683, Westchester was named after the city of Chester, England. The county seat is the city of White Plains, while the most populous municipality in the county is the city of Yonkers, with 211,569 residents per the 2020 census. The county is part of the Hudson Valley region of the state.

The annual per capita income for Westchester was $67,813 in 2011. The 2011 median household income of $77,006 was the fifth-highest in New York (after Nassau, Putnam, Suffolk, and Rockland counties) and the 47th highest in the United States. By 2021, the county&#x27;s median household income had risen to $105,387. Westchester County ranks second in the state after New York County for median income per person, with a higher concentration of incomes in smaller households. Simultaneously, Westchester County had the highest property taxes of any county in the United States in 2013.

Westchester County is one of the centrally located counties within the New York metropolitan area. The county is positioned with New York City, plus Nassau and Suffolk counties (on Long Island, across the Long Island Sound), to its south; Putnam County to its north; Fairfield County, Connecticut, to its east; and Rockland County and Bergen County, New Jersey, across the Hudson River to its west. Westchester was the first suburban area of its scale in the world to develop, due mostly to the upper-middle-class development of entire communities in the late 19th century and the subsequent rapid population growth.

Westchester County has numerous road and mass transit connections to New York City, and the county is home to the headquarters of large multinational corporations including IBM, Mastercard, PepsiCo, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Westchester County high school students often feature prominently as winners of the International Science and Engineering Fair and similar STEM-based academic awards.

==History==
At the time of European contact in the 16th and 17th centuries, the Native American inhabitants of present-day Westchester County were part of the Algonquian peoples, whose name for themselves was Lenape, meaning &quot;the people&quot;. They called the region Lenapehoking, which consisted of the area around and between the Delaware and Hudson Rivers. Several different tribes occupied the area, including The Manhattans, and the Weckquaesgeek and Siwanoy bands of the Wappinger in the south, and Tankiteke, Sintsink and Kitchawank Wappinger in the north.

The first European explorers to visit the Westchester area were Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524 and Henry Hudson in 1609. Dutch settlers began arriving in the 1620s, followed by settlers from England in the 1640s. Westchester County was one of the original twelve counties of the Province of New York, created by an act of the New York General Assembly in 1683. At the time it included present-day Bronx County, and abutted then-Dutchess County to the north. By 1775, Westchester was the richest and most populous county in the colony of New York. Although the Revolutionary War devastated the county, recovery after the war was rapid. In 1788, five years after the end of the war, the county was divided into 20 towns. In 1798, the first federal census recorded a population of 24,000 for the county.

Two developments in the first half of the 19th century—the construction of the first Croton Dam and Aqueduct, and the coming of the railroad—had enormous impacts on the growth of Westchester. The Croton Dam and Aqueduct was begun in 1837 and completed in 1842; now a National Historic Landmark, the Croton Aqueduct is considered one of the great engineering achievements of the 19th century. In the 1840s, the first railroads were built in Westchester, and included the New York and Harlem Railroad, the Hudson River Railroad, and the New York and New Haven Railroad. The railroads often determined the growth of a town, and the population shifted from Northern to Southern Westchester. By 1860, the total county population was 99,000, with the most populated city being Yonkers.

The period following the American Civil War enabled entrepreneurs in the New York area to create fortunes, and many built large estates, such as Lyndhurst, in Westchester. During the latter half of the 19th century, Westchester&#x27;s transportation system and labor force attracted a manufacturing base, particularly along the Hudson River and Nepperhan Creek. In 1874, the western portion of the present Bronx County was transferred to New York County, and in 1895 the remainder of the present Bronx County was also transferred to New York County. These would later split from Manhattan to form a county.

During the 20th century, the rural character of Westchester would transform into the suburban county known today. The Bronx River Parkway, completed in 1925, was the first modern, multi-lane limited-access roadway in North America. The development of Westchester&#x27;s parks and parkway systems supported existing communities and encouraged the establishment of new ones, transforming the development pattern for Westchester. With the need for homes expanding after World War II, multistory apartment houses appeared in the urbanized areas of the county, while the market for single-family houses continued to expand. By 1950, the total county population was 625,816. Major interstate highways were constructed in Westchester during the 1950s and 1960s. The establishment of these roadways, along with the construction of the Tappan Zee Bridge, led to further growth in the county.

==Geography==
Westchester County is located in the New York metropolitan area and Downstate New York, north of New York City and south of Upstate New York. It shares its southern boundary with New York City and its northern border with Putnam County. It is bordered on the west side by the Hudson River and on the east side by the Long Island Sound and Fairfield County, Connecticut. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (14%) is water.

Where Pelham Manor meets Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx, the southern border of Westchester is just under from Columbus Circle in Manhattan. At over , Pelham Bay Park is the largest of New York City&#x27;s parks, forming a substantial buffer between suburban Westchester and the urban Bronx, while Van Cortlandt Park to the west acts as a similar buffer.

===Long Island Sound shore===
Westchester&#x27;s Long Island Sound shore is generally rocky, interspersed with tidal mud flats, marshes and wetlands, as well as several natural and artificially-maintained sand beaches. Municipal and county owned parks provide access to beaches, nature preserves and passive and active waterfront recreational facilities. Several large harbors lie along the shore including Milton Harbor in Rye, Mamaroneck Harbor, Larchmont Harbor, and Echo Bay, and the upper and lower harbors in southern New Rochelle.

A number of islands can be found off the Long Island Sound shore, most of which are located in New Rochelle. Davids Island, the former location of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Fort Slocum, is currently unoccupied but is slated for use as passive parkland; Glen Island, currently a Westchester Parks Department run beach and park, was one of the first amusement parks in the country serving as a summer resort at the turn of the twentieth century; Huckleberry Island is largely undeveloped, and has one of the largest rookeries in western Long Island Sound; Echo Island is owned and used by a private yacht club; Execution Rocks is the site of a 19th-century lighthouse listed on the National Register of Historic Places; Columbia, Pea, and Goose Islands are undeveloped; Clifford, Harrison and Tank Islands are part of the &quot;Five Islands Park&quot; and nature preserve; while Oak and Pine Islands are used as private residences.

===Hudson River===
The widest section of the Hudson River, at , is found between the Westchester and Rockland County shorelines immediately north of Croton Point. In Colonial times, this area was called the Tappan Zee or Sea. The Hudson River is tidal and brackish through Westchester and contains a small number of estuarine marshes. Two bridges span the Hudson in Westchester: the Bear Mountain Bridge crosses at Cortlandt and the Tappan Zee Bridge at Tarrytown. Municipal, county and state-owned parks provide access to waterfront landmarks and sites, including Croton Point in Croton, Kingsland Point in Sleepy Hollow and JFK Memorial Marina in Yonkers.

The Hudson River waterfront in Westchester is in a transitional period, converting from primarily industrial uses to mixed residential, commercial, retail, and recreational uses. This transformation is most notable in Yonkers, Hastings-on-Hudson, Dobbs Ferry, Irvington, Tarrytown, Sleepy Hollow, Ossining, and Peekskill, where redevelopment projects are in various stages of design and completion. In 2004, the county began a project to create Westchester RiverWalk, a walkway along the Hudson River of which will provide pedestrian access between New York City and Putnam County. 32.9 miles of the route are complete and accessible.

At , the highest elevation in the county is a U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey benchmark known as &quot;Bailey&quot; in Mountain Lakes Park near the Connecticut state line. The lowest elevation is sea level, along both the Hudson and Long Island Sound.

===Watersheds===
Westchester County is divided into six primary drainage basins or watersheds: the Upper and Lower Long Island Sound; and the Bronx, Upper Hudson, Lower Hudson, and Croton River basins. Within these primary drainage basins are approximately 60 smaller basins, or subwatersheds. The principal streams draining the southern part of the county include Beaver Swamp Brook, Blind Brook, Bronx River, Hutchinson River, Mamaroneck River, Saw Mill River, Sheldrake River, Stephenson Brook and Tibbetts Brook. The primary streams draining the central part of the county include Byram River, Kisco River, Mianus River, Mill River, Pocantico River and Silvermine River. The principal streams draining the northern part of the county include Dickey Brook, Furnace Brook, Hallocks Mill Brook, Hunter Brook, Muscoot River, Peekskill Hollow Brook, and Titicus River. The county contains several major reservoirs; The Croton system and the Kensico Reservoir are important components of the New York City water supply system. The system is a series of interconnected reservoirs and lakes in northern Westchester and Putnam Counties that provide 10% of New York City&#x27;s water under normal conditions and up to 30% in times of drought. The components of the system include the New Croton Reservoir, the Cross River Reservoir, the Titicus Reservoir, the Amawalk Reservoir, and the Muscoot Reservoir. Other major reservoirs are the Kensico and Byram Lake Reservoir, while there are a number of smaller reservoirs throughout the county.

The Westchester County Department of Planning divides the county into North, Central and South sub-regions.

===Geology===
The rock that underlies Manhattan and Westchester is chiefly gneiss and mica-schist, with layers of dolomitic marble and serpentine.

===Climate===
The climate of Westchester County is borderline humid subtropical and humid continental (Köppen: &quot;Cfa/Dfa&quot;). Winters are cold, wet, and occasionally snowy throughout the county, with more snow inland in higher elevations. Summers are hot inland but cooler towards the coast, with a relative dryness in the early summer. Precipitation is plentiful and in some elevated areas reaches over 50 inches. Snowfall is more common in Westchester than in New York City, with the exception of the southeast of the county where snowfall is often between 20 and 25 inches. In January, inland areas have a low of 21–26 °F and a high of 34–37 °F while coastal areas have a low of 27–30 °F and a high of 38–41 °F. In the summer, this effect is much milder. Coastal areas, including Mamaroneck, New Rochelle, Rye, and Port Chester have highs of 81–83 °F and lows of 68–73 °F, while inland highs will be 84–87 °F and lows will be 65–70 °F. Winds can be heavy, especially by the coast.

Part of New Rochelle is adjacent to the Bronx, where the majority of New York State&#x27;s COVID-19 positive cases were (as of May 8, 350,000 out of 20 million residents). As of April 22 there were a total of 25,276 cases, 838 deaths, and 9,371 recoveries. As of May 22, 2020, there were between 30 and 35,000 cases going both by COVID-19 testing and serological samples, constituting the highest number of highest per capita infections in the world: 3% out of 1 million residents. On May 26, 2020, the area started their first phase of reopening after being placed on lockdown for two months.

==Communities==

Westchester County has six cities, 19 towns, and 23 villages.

Cities in Westchester have many well established sub-areas within the municipal boundaries. Many of these are similar to hamlets and date back to as early as the late 1600s such as Cooper&#x27;s Corners in New Rochelle. These areas also include some of the first planned communities in the country such as New Rochelle&#x27;s Residence Park, Rochelle Park and Heights and Sutton Manor.

The six cities in the county are:
Any land area in the county that is not contained in one of the cities is in a town. A town may have from zero to multiple villages. The largest city in the county by population is Yonkers with over 211,000 residents. The city with the highest population density is Mount Vernon with a density of 15,564 individuals per square mile.

The towns of Harrison, Mount Kisco, and Scarsdale are coterminous with the villages of the same names. Two villages are split between two towns: Briarcliff Manor crosses the border between Ossining town and Mount Pleasant, and Mamaroneck village straddles the boundary between Mamaroneck town and Rye town.

With the exception of the towns of Rye, Pelham, Harrison, Mount Kisco, and Scarsdale, all the towns contain area and residents which do not belong to any village. These areas may contain communities referred to as hamlets, or &quot;unincorporated areas&quot;. Hamlets have no legal status and depend upon the town for all municipal government and services. There are also areas called census-designated places (CDPs), which are defined by the U.S. Census Bureau for statistical purposes only. A CDP may or may not correspond to a hamlet.

Because some municipalities have the same name, it is often necessary to indicate whether one is referring to the city, town, village, or hamlet. For example, the town of Rye is completely separate from the city of Rye. Pelham is the name of a town and also of a village in the town. The village of Mamaroneck is located partially in the town of Mamaroneck and partially in the town of Rye, but has nothing to do with the city of Rye.

ZIP Codes in Westchester often are not coterminous with the actual municipality borders, causing mailing addresses to sometimes differ from the actual municipal location in which a property resides. For instance, the ZIP Codes for Bronxville, Larchmont, Rye, and Scarsdale contain large areas that lie outside of those municipalities.

All of the towns have justice courts, and some of the villages do as well.

===High technology===

Tech Valley is a marketing name for the eastern part of New York State, including the Hudson Valley and the Capital District. The term originated in 1998 to promote the Greater Albany metropolitan area as a competitor to regions such as Silicon Valley and Boston. It has since grown to represent the counties in New York between IBM&#x27;s Westchester County plants in the south and the Canada–U.S. border to the north.

===Biotechnology===
Westchester County has also developed a burgeoning biotechnology sector in the 21st century, with over $1 billion in planned private investment as of 2016, spurring &quot;Westchester Magazine&quot; to nickname the county &quot;Biochester&quot;. In April 2017, county officials unveiled plans for an 80-acre, 3 million square-foot biotechnology hub to be built with US$1.2 billion in private investment on vacant land adjacent to Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla; the bioscience center, a public-private partnership, is anticipated to create 12,000 new jobs and include over 2.25 million square feet of biotechnology research space.

==Education==

===Politics===












|}

Westchester County generally leans toward the political left in recent decades. The Republican nominee for president last won a majority in 1988.

Historically, Westchester County was a classic &quot;Yankee Republican&quot; county. It supported Republican presidential candidates in all but two elections from 1896 to 1988. The only exceptions were 1912, when the GOP was divided between William Howard Taft and Theodore Roosevelt, and 1964, when Lyndon B. Johnson won a national landslide and swept every county in New York. As a measure of how Republican the county was for years, it was one of the few counties where Franklin D. Roosevelt of neighboring Dutchess County was completely shut out in all four of his campaigns for president.

However, it swung Democratic in the early 1990s—much like other New York City suburbs. In the most recent national elections, Westchester voters tended to be far more Democratic than the national average. In fact, Westchester, after New York City and Albany County, has produced the biggest margins for statewide Democrats in recent years. Democratic voters are mainly concentrated in the more populated southern and central parts of the county. More than 63 percent of Westchester County voters voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential race, the seventh-highest percentage of any New York county.

Currently, Westchester County is represented in the U.S. House by Republican and Democrat . Lawler&#x27;s district covers most of the county&#x27;s northern half. It also includes all of Rockland and Putnam Counties and a portion of Dutchess. Latimer&#x27;s district includes most of the southern half of the county, including Yonkers, Mount Vernon, White Plains, New Rochelle and Rye along with a sliver of the Bronx.

Additionally, Republicans remain competitive with Democrats in state and local elections. For instance, it voted for Republican George Pataki, by a margin of 23.07% against Democratic candidate, Carl McCall in the gubernatorial race of 2002, and by 26.22% in 1998. Pataki hails from Westchester; he previously served as mayor of Peekskill and represented part of the county in the state Assembly and state Senate prior to being elected governor.

In 1998, County Executive Andrew Spano became just the second Democrat to hold the post in at least a half-century. In 2006, county legislator Andrea Stewart-Cousins defeated 20-year incumbent Nicholas Spano for a seat in the New York State Senate in a rematch of the 2004 race, which she had lost by only 18 votes. His brother, Assembly Member Mike Spano, switched parties in July 2007 to become a Democrat. District attorney Janet DiFiore also switched parties from Republican to Democratic in August 2007. In 2009, Republican Rob Astorino ousted three-term county executive Andy Spano, who had the endorsement of the New York Conservative Party, winning in a landslide. Astorino became the first Republican county executive since Andrew O&#x27;Rourke left the post in 1997. In 2011, the GOP broke the Democratic two-thirds majority in the county legislature by picking up two seats. However, two of the Democrats formed a coalition with the Republicans to control the board, with a Republican becoming vice-chair. In 2017 Democrats gained three seats to take outright control of the board. In 2019 Democrats gained two seats and in 2020 the last remaining Republican switched parties to become a Democrat. As of the 2021 elections the current composition is fifteen Democrats, one Republican and one Conservative.

Westchester County was the home of U.S. Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, who occupied the Kykuit mansion near the hamlet of Pocantico Hills.

The county is also home to 42nd U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who live in Chappaqua. Former First Lady Barbara Bush grew up in Rye.

U.S. President Donald Trump owns a home in Bedford. The 230-acre Seven Springs estate was acquired by Trump in 1996.

==Law enforcement and emergency services==
There are currently 42 local police agencies located in Westchester County. These agencies frequently work with one another and with other agencies, including county, state, and federal law enforcement agencies responsible for protecting Westchester County.

Westchester County has a wide array of emergency services and is the home to 58 municipal fire departments, one federal fire department, 42 ambulance services, three Haz-Mat teams, a volunteer technical rescue team, a fire academy and a fire investigations unit. Each department has career, volunteer or a combination of personnel. Westchester County Department of Emergency Services operates the main dispatching system for EMS and fire departments, located in Valhalla. The department also provides numerous support services for the various agencies throughout the county.

The Career Chief&#x27;s Association, a cooperative of career fire departments, also operates the Special Operations Task Force. The force consists of six squad companies that can be rapidly assembled for a major hazardous materials incident, CBRNE event, collapse or confined space rescue, or other incident requiring a large number of HazMat or rescue technicians. Over 700 firefighters, police officers and EMS providers were trained to be part of this effort and serve over half the population of Westchester County including Yonkers, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, White Plains, Scarsdale, Eastchester, and the Fairview, Hartsdale, and Greenville Fire Departments in the Town of Greenburgh.

==Transportation==
The combination of the county&#x27;s numerous roadways and bridges, proximity to New York City, and the county&#x27;s large population all lead to substantial traffic enforcement and busy local courts.

Transportation routes have been responsible for the county&#x27;s development patterns, with city and town growth being most pronounced along these corridors. There are five mostly north–south corridors and three which traverse the county in the east–west direction. The north–south routes are (going from west to east): S. Route 9/Albany Post Rd/Broadway Corridor, the Saw Mill River Parkway Corridor, the Sprain Brook Parkway, the Hutchinson River Parkway, and the I-95/New England Thruway. The east–west corridors are, from south to north: the Cross County Parkway, the Cross Westchester Expressway/I-287, and the U.S. 202 corridor.

The Tappan Zee Bridge bridges the Hudson River between Tarrytown in Westchester and South Nyack in Rockland County; costing $4 billion, it was constructed during 2013–2017 to replace an earlier bridge at the same location and was renamed the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge upon its opening. About upstream, the Bear Mountain Bridge crosses the Hudson between Cortlandt and Orange County.

===Public transit===
Westchester County Airport serves the county, and is adjacent to White Plains. Bus service is provided by the Bee-Line Bus System (owned by the Westchester County Department of Public Works and Transportation) within Westchester and to/from the Bronx, Manhattan, and Putnam County. Additionally, the MTA Bus Company runs to and from Getty Square in Yonkers to Midtown Manhattan. The Hudson Link operates express bus routes from city centers and train stations in Tarrytown and White Plains to Nyack, Nanuet, Spring Valley in Rockland County on the opposite side of the Hudson River.

Additionally, NY Waterway operates a water ferry service between Ossining in Westchester and Haverstraw in Rockland County.

====Railroads====
Amtrak serves Croton-Harmon, New Rochelle, and Yonkers. Commuter rail service in Westchester is provided by Metro-North Railroad (operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority). Metro-North operates three lines in the county; west to east, they are the Hudson, the Harlem, and the New Haven lines. These are former operations of the New York Central and the New York, New Haven and Hartford railroads (and their successors, Penn Central and Conrail), each of which stops in the Bronx between Westchester and Manhattan.

== In popular culture ==

Westchester County has been the home of many novelists, including Washington Irving. His most famous work is &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot;, which is set at the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow among other locations in Sleepy Hollow, New York. The story has inspired a variety of works, including the 2013 television series &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, set in the modern village.

In the &quot;X-Men&quot; multimedia series, the X-Mansion is located on the Titicus Reservoir, on Graymalkin Lane, outside of Salem Center. At the mansion, Professor Charles Xavier runs the Xavier &quot;School for Gifted Youngsters&quot; to educate mutant children and keeps a headquarters for the X-Men.

One of the most successful films shot in the county was the 1988 film &quot;Big&quot;. While the majority of the film takes place in New York City, the amusement park scenes were filmed in Rye Playland in Westchester.

American singer and songwriter Loudon Wainwright III recorded a song titled &quot;Westchester County&quot; for his 1983 LP record &quot;Fame and Wealth&quot;. It recounts his postwar upbringing in Bedford, Westchester County, New York.

In print media, the area is a frequent setting of the Nero Wolfe detective stories by Rex Stout, which ran from 1934 to 1975. An early documented mention of Westchester County is in the Trixie Belden series (which ran from 1948 to 1986). The series was set in Sleepyside-on-Hudson, a fictional village in the Hudson Valley. The original author, Julie Campbell Tatham, modeled the fictional Crabapple Farm in Sleepyside after her own home at Wolf Hollow on Glendale Road in Ossining. She also mentioned it in her last work in the series: Cherry Ames, Country Doctor&#x27;s Nurse. Westchester is the primary setting and residence of the main characters in &quot;The Clique&quot; young adult novel series by Lisi Harrison. In Edward Lewis Wallant&#x27;s novel &quot;The Pawnbroker&quot;, the main character Sol Nazerman lives in Mount Vernon.

In television, an early broadcast media presentation of Westchester County was on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; (1961–1966), whose main characters live in New Rochelle. Much was made of their suburban setting and Rob&#x27;s separate world from New York City. The 1970s sitcom &quot;Maude&quot; was set in Tuckahoe. In the final season of the American sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;, the characters Monica and Chandler moved from New York City to live in Westchester. In the CBS sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, Future Ted and his family live in Westchester. In the AMC show &quot;Mad Men&quot;, Ossining is home to main characters Don Draper and his family. From season 4, Don lives in Manhattan and Betty lives with Henry Francis and the children in Rye. The animated show &quot;Big Mouth&quot; is also set in Westchester County, where creator Nick Kroll grew up.

E. L. Doctorow&#x27;s novel &quot;Ragtime&quot; and the subsequent musical adaptation &quot;Ragtime: The Musical&quot; are both partially set in New Rochelle. The town serves as a setting that represents the affluence of white suburbanites in the early stages of the 20th century.
