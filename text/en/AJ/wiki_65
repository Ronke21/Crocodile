<text>A supermodel is a highly paid fashion model who has a worldwide reputation and background in &quot;haute couture&quot; and commercial modeling. The term became popular in the 1990s.
Supermodels usually work for prominent fashion designers and clothing brands. They may have multimillion-dollar contracts, endorsements, and campaigns. Supermodels have branded themselves as household names and worldwide recognition is associated with their modeling careers. They have been on the covers of leading fashion magazines. Claudia Schiffer stated in 2007 that, &quot;In order to become a supermodel one must be on all the covers all over the world at the same time so that people can recognise the girls.&quot;

== History ==

===Origins===
An early use of the term &quot;supermodel&quot; appeared in 1891, in an interview with artist Henry Stacy Marks for &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;, in which Marks told journalist Harry How, &quot;A good many models are addicted to drink, and, after sitting a while, will suddenly go to sleep. Then I have had what I call the &#x27;super&#x27; model. You know the sort of man; he goes in for theatrical effect ...&quot; On 6 October 1942, a writer named Judith Cass had used the term &quot;super model&quot; for her article in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, which headlined &quot;Super Models Are Signed for Fashion Show&quot;. Later in 1943, an agent named Clyde Matthew Dessner used the term in a &quot;how-to&quot; book about modeling, entitled &quot;So You Want to Be a Model!&quot;, in which Dessner wrote, &quot;She will be a super-model, but the girl in her will be like the girl in you—quite ordinary, but ambitious and eager for personal development.&quot; According to &quot;Model: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women&quot; by Michael Gross, the term &quot;supermodel&quot; was first used by Dessner in the 1940s. In 1949, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine referred to Anita Colby, the highest paid model at the time, as a &quot;super model&quot;: &quot;She&#x27;s been super model, super movie saleswoman, and top brass at Selznick and Paramount.&quot; On 18 October 1959, Vancouver&#x27;s &quot;Chinatown News&quot; described Susan Chew as a &quot;super model&quot;.
The term &quot;supermodel&quot; had also been used several times in the media in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1965, the encyclopedic guide &quot;American Jurisprudence Trials&quot; used the term &quot;super model&quot; (&quot;...at issue was patient&#x27;s belief that her husband was having an affair with a super model&quot;). On 21 March 1967, &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to Twiggy as a supermodel; the February 1968 article of &quot;Glamour&quot; listed all 19 &quot;supermodels&quot;; &quot;The Chicago Daily Defender&quot; wrote &quot;New York Designer Turns Super Model&quot; in January 1970; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and the &quot;Mansfield News Journal&quot; used the term in 1971; and in 1974, both the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and &quot;The Advocate&quot; used the term &quot;supermodel&quot; in their articles. American &quot;Vogue&quot; used the term &quot;super-model&quot; to describe Jean Shrimpton in the 15 October 1965 edition, and &quot;supermodel&quot; on the cover page to describe Margaux Hemingway in the 1 September 1975 edition. Hemingway was again described as a &quot;supermodel&quot; in the 25 July 1977 edition of &quot;Time&quot;. &quot;Jet&quot; also described Beverly Johnson as a &quot;supermodel&quot; in the 22 December 1977 edition.

Model Janice Dickinson has incorrectly stated that she coined the term &quot;supermodel&quot; in 1979, as a compound of Superman and model. During an interview with &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, Dickinson stated that her agent, Monique Pilar of Elite Model Management, asked her, &quot;Janice, who do you think you are, Superman?&quot; She replied, &quot;No ... I&#x27;m a supermodel, honey, and you will refer to me as a supermodel and you will start a supermodel division.&quot; Dickinson also claims to have been the first supermodel.

Lisa Fonssagrives is widely considered to have been the world&#x27;s first supermodel, with a career that began in the 1930s. She was in most of the major fashion magazines and general interest magazines from the 1930s to the 1950s, including &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, the original &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot;. Evelyn Nesbit (with a career launched around 1900) and Dorian Leigh (her career launched in 1944) have also been called the world&#x27;s first supermodel, as well as Jean Shrimpton (early 1960s), and Gia Carangi (late 1970s).

Dutch-born model Wilhelmina Cooper holds the record for most covers on American &quot;Vogue&quot;, appearing 27 or 28 times throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Cooper would go on to found Wilhelmina Models modeling and talent agency in 1967.

===1960s–1970s===
In February 1968, an article in &quot;Glamour&quot; described 19 models as &quot;supermodels&quot;: Cheryl Tiegs, Veruschka, Lisa Palmer, Peggy Moffitt, Sue Murray, Twiggy, Sunny Harnett, Marisa Berenson, Gretchen Harris, Heide Wiedeck, Irish Bianchi, Hiroko Matsumoto, Anne de Zogheb, Kathy Carpenter, Jean Shrimpton, Jean Patchett, Benedetta Barzini, Claudia Duxbury and Agneta Frieberg.
In the 1970s is when many consider the origination of the supermodel, some models becoming more prominent as their names became more recognizable to the general public by commercial endorsements, magazine covers,posters, securing large sums of money for cosmetic contracts, TV appearances and movie roles. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; editor Jule Campbell abandoned then-current modeling trends for its fledgling &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Swimsuit Issue by photographing &quot;bigger and healthier&quot; California models, and captioning the photographs with their names, turning many of them into household names and establishing the swimsuit issue as a cornerstone of supermodel status.

In 1973, Lauren Hutton became the first model to receive a contract from a cosmetics company, when Revlon hired her to sell their Ultima line. She has also appeared on the cover of &quot;Vogue&quot; 26 times. Naomi Sims is considered to be the first black supermodel. Donyale Luna, Beverly Johnson and Iman have also been referred to as the first black supermodel. 

In 1975, Margaux Hemingway landed a then-unprecedented million-dollar contract as the face of Fabergé&#x27;s Babe perfume and the same year, appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, labelled as one of the &quot;New Beauties&quot;, giving further name recognition to fashion models.

Christie Brinkley has the distinction of having the longest running cosmetics contract of any model in history when she represented CoverGirl for twenty five years.

Anna Bayle, a Filipino-born model who rose to prominence in the 1970s, has been cited as one of the first Southeast Asian supermodels.

Donyale Luna was the first black model to appear in British &quot;Vogue&quot;, in March 1966. Naomi Sims, who is sometimes regarded as the first black supermodel, became the first African American to feature on the cover of &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, in 1968. The first African American model to be on the cover of American &quot;Vogue&quot; was Beverly Johnson in 1974. Pat Cleveland, another prominent African-American model, has also been described as one of the first black supermodels, in particular by former editor-at-large for American &quot;Vogue&quot; André Leon Talley, in an article for the June 1980 issue of &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine, and again in his 2003 memoir.

===1980s===
In October 1981, &quot;Life&quot; cited Shelley Hack, Lauren Hutton, and Iman for Revlon, Margaux Hemingway for Fabergé, Karen Graham for Estée Lauder, Cristina Ferrare for Max Factor, and Cheryl Tiegs for CoverGirl by proclaiming them the &quot;million dollar faces&quot; of the beauty industry. These supermodels negotiated previously unheard of lucrative and exclusive deals with the giant cosmetics companies, were instantly recognizable, and their names became well known to the general public.

In the early 1980s, Inès de La Fressange was the first model to sign an exclusive modeling contract with an haute couture fashion house, Chanel. During the early 1980s, fashion designers began advertising on television and billboards. Catwalk regulars like Gia Carangi, Tiegs, Christie Brinkley, Kim Alexis, Paulina Porizkova, Yasmin Le Bon, Kathy Ireland, Brooke Shields, and Elle Macpherson began to endorse products with their names, as well as their faces, through the marketing of brands, such as Diet Pepsi and Ford trucks. In 1980, 14-year-old Shields was the youngest fashion model ever to appear on the cover of &quot;Vogue&quot;. Later that same year, Shields appeared in controversial print and TV ads for Calvin Klein jeans. The TV ad included her saying the famous tagline, &quot;You want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing.&quot; Brooke Shields&#x27; ads would help catapult Klein&#x27;s career to super-designer status.

As the models began to embrace old-style glamour, they were starting to replace film stars as symbols of luxury and wealth. In this regard, supermodels were viewed not so much as individuals but as images.

===1990s===
By the 1990s, the supermodel became increasingly prominent in the media. The title became tantamount to superstar, to signify a supermodel&#x27;s fame having risen simply from &quot;personality&quot;. Supermodels did talk shows, were cited in gossip columns, partied at the trendiest nightspots, landed movie roles, inspired franchises, dated or married film stars, and earned themselves millions. Fame empowered them to take charge of their careers, to market themselves, and to command higher fees.

The new era began in 1990, with the era-defining British &quot;Vogue&quot; cover of Cindy Crawford, Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, and Tatjana Patitz, photographed by Peter Lindbergh, which created such an impression on the fashion world that they came to embody the term &quot;supermodel&quot;. Each model had gradually attained fame since the mid-1980s and was now among the industry&#x27;s top stars. Selected by Lindbergh for the January cover of &quot;Vogue&quot;, the cover inspired singer George Michael to cast the same five models in the music video for his song, &quot;Freedom! &#x27;90&quot;, directed by David Fincher. The other photograph that captured this new generation of fashion models is the black and white nude of Crawford, Patitz, Campbell and Stephanie Seymour taken by Herb Ritts that originally ran in the May 1989 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, until a variation of this image which included Turlington was released in the 1990s, only after a contract exclusively binding her to Calvin Klein expired - thereby publicly revealing the now iconic image &quot;Stephanie, Cindy, Christy, Tatjana, Naomi, Hollywood 1989.&quot; Lindbergh&#x27;s and Ritts&#x27; group images helped each model attain worldwide fame by sharing covers of all the international editions of &quot;Vogue&quot;, walking the catwalks for the world&#x27;s top designers, and becoming known by their first names alone.

Today, Campbell, Crawford, Evangelista, Patitz and Turlington are regarded as the &quot;Original Supermodels&quot;, but the term has been used to describe the pioneering supermodels before them that paved the way and started the path to prominence, both publicly and professionally, such as Lauren Hutton, Beverly Johnson, Cheryl Tiegs, Christie Brinkley, Pat Cleveland and others.

In 1991, Turlington signed a contract with Maybelline that paid her $800,000 for twelve days&#x27; work each year. Four years later, Claudia Schiffer reportedly earned $12 million for her various modeling assignments. Authorities, ranging from Karl Lagerfeld to &quot;Time&quot;, had declared the supermodels more glamorous than movie stars.

Campbell, Evangelista and Turlington became known as &quot;The Trinity&quot;, a term first used by photographer Steven Meisel and noted by journalist Michael Gross. Evangelista was known as the &quot;Chameleon&quot;, for her ability to transform her look and reinvent herself. Turlington was known as the &quot;insurance model&quot;, saying &quot;clients know that if they hire me, nothing will go wrong&quot;. Campbell was the first black model to appear on the front covers of &quot;Time&quot;, French &quot;Vogue&quot;, British &quot;Vogue&quot;, and the September issue of American &quot;Vogue&quot;, traditionally the biggest and most important issue of the year.

Campbell, Crawford, Evangelista, Patitz and Turlington were the original group to be regarded as &quot;The Big Five&quot; supermodels of the 1990s. The term &quot;The Big Five&quot; was later used to describe Campbell, Crawford, Evangelista, Turlington and Claudia Schiffer, and with the addition of Kate Moss, they became known as &quot;the Big Six&quot;. It was Linda Evangelista, Tatjana Patitz, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington, and Kate Moss who appeared together in the highest budgeted advertising campaign of all time, starring the original supermodels ($4.5 million USD in 1992, adjusted for inflation in 2021, $8.5 million USD)) and resulted in a now iconic television commercial for the Vauxhall Corsa automobile.

In the 2006 book &quot;In Vogue: The Illustrated History of the World&#x27;s Most Famous Fashion Magazine&quot; (Rizzoli), the editors cite the &quot;original supermodels&quot; and Schiffer when quoting &quot;Vogue&quot; Magazine Editor-In-Chief, Anna Wintour, who said, &quot;Those girls were so fabulous for fashion and totally reflected that time ... [They] were like movie stars.&quot; The editors name famous models from previous decades, but explain that, &quot;None of them attained the fame and worldwide renown bestowed on Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Tatjana Patitz, Stephanie Seymour, Claudia Schiffer, Yasmeen Ghauri, and Karen Mulder, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These models burst out beyond the pages of the magazines. Many became the faces of cosmetics brands and perfumes, had their own television programs and physical-fitness videos, and their own lines of lingerie ... Their lives, activities, influences, and images were the subjects of all types of sociological and historical analysis.&quot; Tyra Banks had begun her career as a model, booking a record-breaking 25 shows in 1991, during her breakout year. She achieved Supermodel status, and rivaled Naomi Campbell as the top Black model in the world.

In the mid-1990s, the initial era of the supermodel ended and a new era for the supermodel began driven by heroin chic. By the late 1990s, actresses, pop singers, and other entertainment celebrities began gradually replacing models on fashion magazine covers and ad campaigns. The pendulum of limelight left many models in anonymity. A popular &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; explaining the supermodel&#x27;s disappearance is that designers and fashion editors grew weary of the &quot;I won&#x27;t get out of bed for less than $10,000 a day&quot; attitude and made sure no small group of models would ever again have the power of the Big Six.

Charles Gandee, associate editor at &quot;Vogue&quot;, has said that high prices and poor attitudes contributed less to the decline of the supermodel. As clothes became less flashy, designers turned to models who were less glamorous, so they wouldn&#x27;t overpower the clothing. Whereas many supermodels of the previous era were American-born, their accents making for an easier transition to stardom, the majority of models began coming from non-English speaking countries and cultures, making the crossover to mainstream spokesperson and cover star difficult. However, the term continued to be applied to notable models such as Kristen McMenamy, Stella Tennant, Laetitia Casta, Eva Herzigová, Carla Bruni, Tatiana Sorokko, Yasmin Le Bon, Amber Valletta, Shalom Harlow, Nadja Auermann, Helena Christensen, Patricia Velásquez, Adriana Karembeu, Valeria Mazza and later, Milla Jovovich.

===2000s and present day===
Emerging in the late 1990s, Gisele Bündchen became the first in a wave of Brazilian models to gain popularity in the industry and with the public. With numerous covers of &quot;Vogue&quot; under her belt, including an issue that dubbed her the &quot;Return of the &quot;Sexy&quot; Model&quot;, Bündchen was credited with ending the &quot;heroin chic&quot; era of models. Following in her footsteps by signing contracts with Victoria&#x27;s Secret, fellow Brazilians Adriana Lima and Alessandra Ambrosio rose to prominence; however, they were unable to cross over into the world of TV, movies and talk shows as easily as their predecessors, due to their foreign accents. Not to mention other big stars of 00s era such as Carmen Kass, Karolína Kurková, Hana Soukupová, Isabeli Fontana, Natalia Vodianova and Natasha Poly, which also dominated the runways and ad campaigns along with Bündchen et al.

Several seasons later, they were followed by Eastern Europeans, barely into their teens, pale, and &quot;bordering on anorexic. They were too young to become movie stars or date celebrities; too skeletal to bag Victoria&#x27;s Secret contracts; and a lack of English didn&#x27;t bode well for a broad media career&quot;. The opportunities for superstardom were waning in the modeling world, and models like Heidi Klum and Tyra Banks took to television with reality shows like &quot;Project Runway&quot; and &quot;Germany&#x27;s Next Topmodel&quot;, and &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;, respectively, to not only remain relevant but establish themselves as media moguls.

Contrary to the fashion industry&#x27;s celebrity trend of the previous decade, lingerie retailer Victoria&#x27;s Secret continues to groom and launch young talents into supermodel status, awarding their high-profile &quot;Angels&quot; multi-year, multimillion-dollar contracts.

American &quot;Vogue&quot; dubbed ten models (Doutzen Kroes, Agyness Deyn, Hilary Rhoda, Raquel Zimmermann, Coco Rocha, Lily Donaldson, Chanel Iman, Sasha Pivovarova, Caroline Trentini and Jessica Stam) as the new crop of supermodels in their May 2007 cover story, while the likes of Christie Brinkley, Christy Turlington, and Linda Evangelista returned to reclaim prominent contracts from celebrities and younger models.

The rise of social media and so-called &quot;nepotism babies&quot; has seen a shift in the world of modelling from the late 2010s onwards. This means that many of today&#x27;s &#x27;supermodels&#x27; arguably took a rise to fame and were given the opportunities as they have due to their rich and famous families. Examples of these models are Kendall Jenner, Cara Delevingne, Bella Hadid, Gigi Hadid and Kaia Gerber. Despite the controversy surrounding these models and arguments that they only got their fame due to their families, they have proven to be some of the most successful models of today. In 2021, Kendall Jenner was named as the highest-paid supermodel, earning $40 million. The Hadid sisters weren&#x27;t far behind, with Bella and Gigi earning $19 million and $20 million respectively.

== Male supermodels ==

In addition to the models stated previously, a top-grossing part of the industry that tends to be overlooked is the male side of modeling. Even though women are predominantly known in the modeling industry, men also appear in advertisements for clothing, cologne, sports wear and other such accessories.

Modeling is one of the only industries that sees a gender gap leaning towards women. Women earn up to 75% more than men in the modeling industry. The highest paid models in the world in 2022, the American female model Kendall Jenner earned $40 million while the American male model Sean O’Pry earned $1.5 million, only 3% of what Jenner is making. Historically, the menswear sector has gotten less financial support than the womenswear industry. In addition to that, there is only 1 male designer for every 20 female designers. Overall, the demand for female models is much greater than that for male models. Some also attribute the pay difference to the lengthier career of male models compared to female models due to the fashion industry’s dismissive attitude towards older women.

Study has shown that there has been an annual 17.4% increase in men’s clothing online from 2010-2015. The men’s apparel segment amounts to US$568.9 billion in 2023 and the market is expected to grow annually by 2.9%. Compared to 2014, the men’s apparel market in 2023 has grown by 28%. According to Euromonitor, demand for men’s clothing has even been growing 0.2% faster than that of women’s. In recent years, there have also been separate men’s fashion weeks in Paris, Milan, New York, and London. Studies have shown that this can be attributed to more men being found to begin to care more about fashion and beauty and the social media savvy male models / celebrities, like Lucky Blue Smith, Jason Morgan, and David Gandy.

===Diversity and inclusion in the male modeling industry===

Sterling St. Jacques is considered the first black male supermodel. St. Jacques was featured in &quot;Vogue&quot; and photographed by Horst P. Horst in the 1970s. His modeling career took off after he was discovered by Hubert de Givenchy to dance down the runway at a fashion show in 1976. In 1976, St. Jacques told &quot;Sepia&quot; magazine: &quot;I think it’s a mistake that many black male models have felt the need to put forward a macho image like that because the fashion market is too limited to have much success using it. I&#x27;ve shown that black men can be macho-looking while at the same time have grace and smoothness. I&#x27;m proud to make black people see they can be doing this kind of work.&quot;

In 1994, Polo’s sports ad shot by Bruce Weber featured Tyson Beckford, a black masculine male model. Beckford later admitted during an interview in 2014 that, &quot;There&#x27;s a huge lack of strong African American images in fashion.&quot; Beckford also noted that, &quot;I am happy that Ralph Lauren have used guys who look similar like me after.&quot;

In the summer of 2011, the Vancouver model Godfrey Gao also became Louis Vuitton, the luxury brand’s first Asian model.

In 2016, IMG Models launched its Brawn division which aimed to elevate the careers of plus-size male models. The first model hired under the new division is Zach Miko. Three years in, IMG has 7 models under the Brawn division.

In October 2022, Steven Green, the Kansas City born fashion photographer, starred in Rihanna’s Savage X Fenty’s men underwear campaign as a plus-size model. Green reflected that, &quot;he was not confident being his size and shirtless on the internet, but the positive feedback he got was inspiring to him.&quot;

===Male model requirements===

Usually, the mass majority (not all) of agencies that sign on fashion/runway male models favor a height range consisting of to . The more strict agencies set a minimum height of .

===1990s===
In 1993, Italian model Fabio Lanzoni was the highest paid male model worldwide, receiving several million dollars a year doing advertisements for high-end brands like Versace.

Milind Soman quickly became a supermodel in India and was one of the most popular supermodels of the world in the 90s, successfully transitioning to films and television later in life.

Tyson Beckford is known for posing in a number of ads for Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Polo sport cologne line. Since 1990, he has been the face of Gucci and Tommy Hilfiger, won Model of the year on VH1 Fashion award, and he has also appeared in Calvin Klein&#x27;s campaign.

Tim Boyce was the first openly gay high fashion male supermodel of the 1990s and is credited for increasing the profile of gay celebrities, appearing on the cover of &quot;Out&quot; magazine as well as campaigns for Giorgio Armani and Gianfranco Ferre.

===2000s===
In 2000s, Bruno Santos, a Brazilian model, became notorious for being the only male model selected to carry out two campaigns simultaneously for two competing fashion houses: Versace and Giorgio Armani. This earned him the nickname &quot;Gisele Bündchen in pants&quot;.

Former professional soccer player David Beckham is noted as the Underwear Model of the Century. He has modeled for worldwide ads for H&amp;M, Adidas, Calvin Klein, Burger King, Sainsbury&#x27;s, and Breitling. British model David Gandy was described as achieving &quot;icon status&quot; by ABC News when they featured him on &quot;Nightline&quot;, stating, &quot;As the face of Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Lucky Jeans, Gandy is arguably one of the most successful male models ever, but he&#x27;s a bit modest about that &quot;supermodel&quot; title.&quot;

===2010s===
Vogue.com ranked the &quot;Top 10 Male Models of All Time&quot; in September 2014; the list included Tyson Beckford, David Gandy, Brad Kroenig, Sean O&#x27;Pry, Jon Kortajarena, Marcus Schenkenberg, Mathias Lauridsen, Mark Vanderloo, Noah Mills, and Evandro Soldati. In 2013, &quot;Forbes&quot; named O&#x27;Pry the highest-paid male model.

==Supermodels now==
Various magazines and websites, including various international versions of: Elle, Harper&#x27;s Bazaar, and Vogue, have attributed the &#x27;supermodel&#x27; title to a selection of models.

The male models, include: David Gandy, Jon Kortajarena, Mathias Lauridsen, Alton Mason, and Simon Nessman.

The female models, include: Vittoria Ceretti, Imaan Hammam, Cong He, Felice Noordhoff, Blanca Padilla, Anja Rubik, Mika Schneider, FeiFei Sun, Mona Tougaard, and Rianne Van Rompaey.

=== Plus-size ===

Since 2000, there has been an emergence of models known as female &quot;plus-size&quot; top models, including Robyn Lawley, Crystal Renn, Ashley Graham, Candice Huffine, Tara Lynn, Whitney Thompson, Katya Zharkova, Denise Bidot, Sophie Dahl, Jennie Runk and Natalie Laughlin. These models have been in Catwalks, magazines, and Billboards for brands known worldwide like &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot;, Levi&#x27;s, Forever 21, Cover Girl cosmetics, Saks Fifth Avenue, GQ Magazine, and Chanel. Graham had widespread amount of news coverage worldwide after &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot; had her as one of the three covers of the 2016 edition.

=== In-between size ===

Camille Kostek, an &quot;in-between size&quot; or &quot;middle model&quot;, landed a solo cover of the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Swimsuit Issue in 2019 despite not being on the extreme end of the spectrum as runway size (0–2) or plus-size (10 up). Recalling her difficulty breaking out she has stated, &quot;I was told that it was too bad that I wasn&#x27;t a size 10. That plus-size is a big market right now and it&#x27;s too bad I wasn&#x27;t measuring bigger. My size (4/6) is considered an &quot;in-between size,&quot; meaning I&#x27;m not a straight model nor plus model, I&#x27;m right in the middle.&quot; Regardless, she has walked the runways of New York Fashion Week and Miami Beach Swim Week.

==Perception==

Perception of the supermodel as an industry has been frequent inside and outside the fashion press, from complaints that women desiring this status become unhealthily thin to charges of racism of dominant racial groups of the home countries in the first decade of the twenty-first century, where the &quot;supermodel&quot; generally has to conform to the native majority&#x27;s standard of beauty, for example Northern European standards in United States or Indian standards in India. 

According to fashion writer Guy Trebay of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in 2007, the &quot;android&quot; look was popular, a vacant stare and thin body serving, according to some fashion industry conventions, to set off the couture. This had not always been the case. In the 1970s in North America, black, heavier and &quot;ethnic&quot; models dominated the runways but social changes in the 1980s to the early 2000s persuaded the power players in the fashion industry to shun suggestions of &quot;otherness&quot;. 

However, since the latter part of the first decade of the twenty-first century, an increasing level of racial diversity has been noted among supermodels in the American fashion scene, catering to the growing East Asian markets, including Japanese model Tao Okamoto and Chinese models Fei Fei Sun and Liu Wen. Due to the rising importance of social media and social movements such as third wave body positivity, the range of diversity within the industry expanded to diversity in sizes, genders and social media visibility.

<text>In male human anatomy, the glans penis or penile glans, commonly referred to as the glans, (; from Latin &quot;glans&quot; meaning &quot;acorn&quot;) is the bulbous structure at the distal end of the human penis that is the human male&#x27;s most sensitive erogenous zone and primary anatomical source of sexual pleasure. The glans penis is present in the male reproductive organs of humans and most other mammals where it may appear smooth, spiny, elongated or divided. It is externally lined with mucosal tissue, which creates a smooth texture and glossy appearance. In humans, the glans is located over the distal ends of the corpora cavernosa and is a continuation of the corpus spongiosum of the penis. At the summit appears the urinary meatus and at the base forms the corona glandis. An elastic band of tissue, known as the frenulum, runs on its ventral surface. In men who are not circumcised, it is completely or partially covered by a fold of skin called the foreskin. In adults, the foreskin can generally be retracted over and past the glans manually or sometimes automatically during an erection.

The glans penis develops as the terminal end of the genital tubercle during the embryonic development of the male fetus. The tubercle is present in the embryos of both sexes as an outgrowth in the caudal region that later develops into a primordial phallus. Exposure to male hormones (androgens) initiates the tubercle&#x27;s development into a penis making the glans penis anatomically homologous to the clitoral glans in females. 

The glans is more commonly known as the &quot;head&quot; or the &quot;tip&quot; of the penis, and colloquially referred to in British English and Irish English as the &quot;bellend&quot;.

==Structure==
The glans penis is a body of spongy erectile tissue that is moulded on the rounded ends of the two corpora cavernosa penis, extending farther on their upper than on their lower surfaces. It is the expanded cap of the corpus spongiosum, a sponge-like region that surrounds the male urethra within the penis maintaining it as a viable channel for ejaculation. The glans is covered by a stratified squamous epithelium and a dense layer of connective tissue equivalent to the dermis of typical skin. The papillary layer of the dermis blends into the dense connective tissue forming the tunica albuginea of the corpus spongiosum behind the glans. The external lining with mucosal tissue is responsible for its typical smooth texture and appearance.

The increase of arterial flow during erection fills the erectile tissue with blood causing the glans to grow in size and sensitivity. While the penis is rigid when erect, the glans itself remains slightly softer. The soft cushiony texture of the glans absorbs impact during rigorous instances of copulation. The proportional size of the glans penis can vary among males. While the shape of the glans is typically acorn-like, in some men it might be wider in circumference than the shaft, giving the penis a mushroom-like appearance, while in others it might be narrower and more akin to a probe in shape. Some researchers have suggested that the glans has evolved to become acorn-, mushroom- or cone-shaped so that during copulation it acts to remove any semen still there from previous sex partners, but this is not supported when looking at primate relatives who have different mating behaviors. 

At the summit of the glans is the slit-like vertical external urethral orifice, called the urinary meatus, through which urine, semen and pre-ejaculatory fluid exit the penis. The circumference of the base of the glans forms a rounded projecting border, the corona glandis, overhanging a deep retroglandular groove known as the &quot;coronal sulcus&quot;. Behind the corona is the neck of the penis, which separates the glans and the penile shaft. Ventrally, the two glans wings merge on the midline forming the septum glandis and a triangle or a V-shaped area under it. The frenulum is the highly vascularized elastic band of tissue located on the underside of the glans that connects the foreskin to the head of the penis. The frenulum is supple enough to allow the retraction of the foreskin over the glans and pull it back when the erection is gone. In flaccid state, it tightens to narrow the foreskin opening.

=== Innervation ===
The glans and the frenulum are innervated by the bilateral dorsal nerve of the penis and the perineal nerve, both divisions of the pudendal nerve. Branches of the dorsal nerve extend through the glans ventrolaterally displaying a three-dimensional innervation pattern. The main branches form smaller bundles of nerves that expand outwards into the tissue of the glans. The rich innervation of the glans penis reveals its function as a primary anatomical source of male sexual pleasure. Yang &amp; Bradley argue; &quot;the distinct pattern of innervation of the glans emphasizes its role as a sensory structure&quot;. While Yang &amp; Bradley&#x27;s (1998) report &quot;showed no areas in the glans to be more densely innervated than others.&quot;, Halata &amp; Munger (1986) report that the density of several nerve terminals is greatest in the corona glandis. 

Halata &amp; Spathe (1997) reported; &quot;the glans penis contains a predominance of free nerve endings, numerous genital end bulbs and rarely Pacinian and Ruffinian corpuscles. Merkel nerve endings and Meissner&#x27;s corpuscles (mechanoreceptors typically found in thick glabrous skin) are not present&quot;. The genital end bulbs, that are present throughout the glans, are most numerous in the corona and near the frenulum. Simple, Pacinian and Ruffinian corpuscles are identified predominantly in the corona glandis. The most numerous nerve terminals are free nerve endings present in almost every dermal papilla of the glans, as well as scattered throughout the deeper dermis. 

=== Blood supply ===
The glans penis receives blood from the internal pudental artery through its branch, the dorsal artery of the penis, which also supplies the foreskin, and the penile shaft. Behind the corona, the terminal branches of the dorsal arteries anastomose with the axial arteries through perforating branches before they end in the glans. Branches of the dorsal artery curve around each side of the distal shaft to enter the glans and the frenulum ventrally. Venous drainage of the penis begins at the base of the glans. Small tributaries deriving from the corona form a venous plexus at the neck of the penis, known as the retro-coronal, or retro-, plexus. Smaller paired venules run into the frenulum and the glans from its ventral surface. The deep dorsal vein, one of the two dorsal veins of the penis, serves as a common vessel receiving blood drained from the glans and the two corpora cavernosa through the circumflex veins that surround them.

===Foreskin===
The glans is completely or partially covered by a double-layered fold of skin, known as the foreskin. In adults, glans exposure can be easily achieved by manual retraction of the foreskin or sometimes automatically during erection. The degree of automatic foreskin retraction varies considerably depending on the foreskin length. The foreskin can be characterized as long when the preputial orifice extends beyond the glans during erection or medium when the orifice is located around the meatus. The primary purpose of the foreskin is considered to be the covering of the glans and the urinary meatus, while also maintaining the mucosa in a moist environment. 
Foreskin rectractability gradually increases with age. In infancy the foreskin is fused to the glans, it remains non retractable in early childhood and it continues to be tight during preadolescence. The skin begins to loosen up significantly during puberty allowing the glans to be completely exposed when needed. By the age of eighteen most boys will have a fully retractable foreskin.

In some cases, for cultural, medical, or prophylactic reasons some men undergo circumcision or were circumcised as infants, a procedure where the foreskin is partially or completely removed from the penis. The glans of circumcised men remains fully exposed and dry. Several studies have suggested the glans is generally equally sensitive in both circumcised and uncircumcised penises.

== Development ==
The glans develops as the terminal end of a phallic structure, called the genital tubercle, which forms in the embryo regardless of sex during the early weeks of pregnancy. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into a penis during the development of the reproductive system depending on the exposure to male hormones, such as androgens. In mammals, sexual differentiation is determined by the sperm that carries either an X or a Y (male) chromosome. The Y chromosome contains a sex-determining gene (SRY) that encodes a transcription factor for the protein TDF (testis determining factor) and triggers the creation of testosterone for the embryo&#x27;s development into a male. 

Although the sex of the infant is determined from the moment of conception, the complete external differentiation of the organs begins about eight or nine weeks after conception. Some sources state that the process will be completed by the twelfth week, while others state that it is clearly evident by the thirteenth week and that the sex organs are fully developed by the sixteenth week.

Both the penis and clitoris develop from the same tissues that become the glans and shaft of the penis and this shared embryonic origin makes these two organs homologous (different versions of the same structure). In the female fetus the absence of testosterone will stop the growth of the phallus causing the tubercle to shrink and form the clitoris. In the male fetus the presence of a Y chromosome leads to the development of the testes, which secrete a large amount of hormones called androgens. These hormones will cause the masculinization of the phenotypically indifferent organs. When exposed to testosterone, the genital tubercle elongates to form the penis. By fusion of the urogenital folds—elongated spindle-shaped structures that contribute to the formation of the urethral groove on the belly aspect of the genital tubercle—the urogenital sinus closes completely to form the spongy urethra and the labioscrotal swellings unite to form the scrotum. The secretion of testosterone during this phase plays a decisive role in the final shaping of the penis. After birth, testosterone levels drop significantly until puberty.

== Clinical significance ==
The epithelium of the glans penis consists of mucosal tissue. Birley &quot;et al.&quot; report that excessive washing with soap may dry the mucous membrane which covers the glans penis and cause non-specific dermatitis. The condition is described as an inflammation of the skin, often caused by an irritating substance or a contact allergy. Sensitivity to chemicals in certain products can cause an allergic reaction, including irritation, itching and rash.

Inflammation of the glans penis is known as balanitis. It is a treatable condition that occurs in about 3–11% of males (up to 35% of diabetic males). Edwards reported that it is generally more common in males who have poor hygiene habits or have not been circumcised. It has many causes, including irritation or infection with a wide variety of pathogens. Symptoms of balanitis may appear suddenly or develop gradually. They might include pain, irritation, redness or red patches on the glans penis. Careful identification of the cause with the aid of patient history, physical examination, swabs and cultures, and biopsy are essential in order to determine the proper treatment.

The meatus (opening) of the urethra located at the tip of the glans might become subject to meatal stenosis, a condition mostly seen as a late complication of circumcision. It occurs in about 2–20% of circumcised boys and it is rarely seen in uncircumcised men. It is characterized by a narrowing of the meatus, which might cause sudden or often urges to urinate and burning during the process.

For some individuals who experience difficulty in achieving full glanular engorgement of glans penis, they may be diagnosed with soft glans syndrome (glans insufficiency syndrome). It is often undiagnosed in the general population due to the lack of a standardized nomenclature. 

==Other animals==

=== Mammals ===
==== Carnivores ====
Male felids are able to urinate backwards by curving the tip of the glans penis backward. In cats, the glans penis is covered with spines. Penile spines also occur on the glans of male and female spotted hyenas. In male dogs the glans penis is smooth and consists of two parts called the &quot;bulbus glandis&quot; and &quot;pars longa glandis&quot;. The glans of a fossa&#x27;s penis extends about halfway down the shaft and is spiny except at the tip. In comparison, the glans of felids is short and spiny, while that of viverrids is smooth and long. 

==== Rodents ====
The glans penis of the marsh rice rat is long and robust, averaging long and broad. Winkelmann&#x27;s mouse can most readily be distinguished from its close relatives by its partially corrugated glans penis. In &quot;Thomasomys ucucha&quot;, the glans penis is rounded, short, and small and is superficially divided into left and right halves by a trough at the top and a ridge at the bottom. Most of the glans is covered with spines, except for an area near the tip. The glans penis of a male cape ground squirrel is large with a prominent baculum.

==== Perissodactyls ====
When erect, the glans of a horse&#x27;s penis increases by 3 to . The urethra opens within the urethral fossa, a small pouch at the distal end of the glans. Unlike the human glans, the glans of a horse&#x27;s penis extends backwards on its shaft.

==== Marsupials, monotremes and bats ====
The shape of the glans varies among different marsupial species. In most marsupials, the glans is divided, but male macropods have an undivided glans penis. 

The glans penis is also divided into two parts in platypuses and echidnas.

Males of Racey&#x27;s pipistrelle bat have a narrow, egg-shaped glans penis.

<text>A palette knife is a blunt tool used for mixing or applying paint, with a flexible steel blade. It is primarily used for applying paint to the canvas, mixing paint colors, adding texture to the painted surface, paste, etc., or for marbling, decorative endpapers, etc. The &quot;palette&quot; in the name is a reference to an artist&#x27;s palette which is used for mixing oil paint and acrylic paints.

Art knives come primarily in two types:
* palette knife resembling a putty knife with a rounded tip, suited for mixing paints on the palette; 
* painting knife with a pointed tip, lowered or &quot;cranked&quot; like a trowel, suited to painting on canvas.

While palette knives are manufactured without sharpened cutting edges, with prolonged use they may become &quot;sharpened&quot; by the action of abrasive pigments such as earth colors.

Palette knives are also used in cooking, where their flexibility allows them to easily slide underneath pastries or other items. See frosting spatula.

<doc id="49086" wikidata="Q263892" url="?curid=49086" title="Libanius">
<text>Libanius (; ) was a teacher of rhetoric of the Sophist school in the Eastern Roman Empire. His prolific writings make him one of the best documented teachers of higher education in the ancient world and a critical source of history of the Greek East during the 4th century AD. During the rise of Christian hegemony in the later Roman Empire, he remained unconverted and in religious matters was a pagan Hellene.

==Life==
===Origin===
Libanius was born in Antioch, Coele-Syria located near the modern-day city of Antakya, Turkey. He was born into a deeply cultured and once-influential family that had experienced substantial recent decline. In 303 AD, eleven years before his birth, his family had participated in resisting an insurrection by a local army garrison. In the end, Roman Imperial authorities were equally concerned by local aristocrats arming themselves as they were by the rebellious troops. Libanius&#x27; family fell out of favor and his grandfather was executed. Libanius&#x27; father died when he was eleven, leaving his upbringing to his mother and maternal uncles, who were in the process of rebuilding his family&#x27;s reputation.

At fourteen years old he began his study of rhetoric, for which he withdrew from public life and devoted himself to philosophy. Unfamiliar with Latin literature, he deplored its influence.

===Career===
He studied in Athens under Diophantus the Arab and began his career in Constantinople as a private tutor. He was exiled to Nicomedia in 346 (or earlier) for around five years but returned to Constantinople and taught there until 354. At this time, he held an official appointment as a sophist in the capital and received an imperial salary.
Before his exile, Libanius was a friend of the emperor Julian, with whom some correspondence survives, and in whose memory he wrote a series of orations; they were composed between 362 and 365. 
In winter 353/54 he returned to Antioch in expectation of succeeding his former teacher Zenobius, but the latter refused to yield his place and Libanius could only take the position upon Zenobius&#x27; illness and following death in autumn 354. His pupils included both pagans and Christians. There, he continued to received an imperial salary, which was temporarily cut between , which resulted in Libanius in writing many letters trying to obtain it back.

Libanius used his arts of rhetoric to advance various private and political causes. He attacked the increasing imperial pressures on the traditional city-oriented culture that had been supported and dominated by the local upper classes. Nevertheless, though Libanius liked to assume the role of an honourable, independent citizen, he concerned himself often with winning for himself and his friends honours and privileges bestowed by the central imperial authority. He is known to have protested against the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. In 386, he appealed without success to emperor Theodosius to prevent the destruction of a temple in Edessa, and pleaded for toleration and the preservation of the temples against the predation of Christian monks, who he claimed:
 
The surviving works of Libanius, which include over 1,600 letters, 64 speeches and 96 progymnasmata (rhetorical exercises), are valuable as a historical source for the changing world of the later 4th century. His oration &quot;A Reply To Aristides On Behalf Of The Dancers&quot; is one of the most important records of Roman concert dance, particularly that immensely popular form known as pantomime. His first &quot;Oration I&quot; is an autobiographical narrative, first written in 374 and revised throughout his life, a scholar&#x27;s account that ends as an old exile&#x27;s private journal. Progymnasma 8 (see below for explanation of a &quot;progymnasma&quot;) is an imaginary summation of the prosecution&#x27;s case against a physician charged with poisoning some of his patients.

Although Libanius was not a Christian his students included such notable Christians as John Chrysostom and Theodore of Mopsuestia. Despite his friendship with the pagan restorationist Emperor Julian he was made an honorary &quot;praetorian prefect&quot; by the Christian Emperor Theodosius I.

== Works ==
*64 orations in the three fields of oratory: judicial, deliberative and epideictic, both orations as if delivered in public and orations meant to be privately read (aloud) in the study. The two volumes of selections in the Loeb Classical Library devote one volume to Libanius&#x27; orations that bear on the emperor Julian, the other on Theodosius; the most famous is his &quot;Lamentation&quot; about the desecration of the temples ();
*51 , a traditional public-speaking format of Rhetoric in Antiquity, taking set topics with historical and mythological themes (translations into English by e.g. D.A. Russell, &quot;Libanius: Imaginary Speeches&quot;; M. Johansson, &quot;Libanius&#x27; Declamations 9 and 10&quot;; 
*96 or compositional exercises for students of rhetoric, used in his courses of instruction and widely admired as models of good style;
*57 or introductions to Demosthenes&#x27; orations (written ), in which he sets them in historical context for the novice reader, without polemics; 
*1545 letters have been preserved, more letters than those of Cicero. Some 400 additional letters in Latin were later accepted, purporting to be translations, but a dispassionate examination of the texts themselves shows them to be misattributed or forgeries, by the Italian humanist Francesco Zambeccari in the 15th century. Among his correspondents there was Censorius Datianus.

<doc id="49088" wikidata="Q5146345" url="?curid=49088" title="College Bowl">
<text>College Bowl (which has carried a naming rights sponsor, initially General Electric and later Capital One) is a radio, television, and student quiz show. &quot;College Bowl&quot; first aired on the NBC Radio Network in 1953 as &quot;College Quiz Bowl&quot;. It then moved to American television broadcast networks, airing from 1959 to 1963 on CBS and from 1963 to 1970 on NBC. In 1977, the president of College Bowl, Richard Reid, developed it into a non-televised national championship competition on campuses across America through an affiliation with the Association of College Unions International (ACUI), which lasted for 31 years. In 1989, College Bowl introduced a (sponsored) version of College Bowl for historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) called Honda Campus All-Star Challenge (HCASC) which is ongoing. In 2007, College Bowl produced a new version and format of the game as an international championship in Africa, called Africa Challenge (Celtel Africa Challenge, Zain Africa Challenge). The College Bowl Campus Program and National Championship ran until 2008.

In November 2020, NBC announced a revival of the show, developed from the format of Honda Campus All-Star Challenge and &quot;Africa Challenge&quot;, with Peyton Manning as host and a ten-episode run ordered. The revival, &quot;Capital One College Bowl&quot;, aired from June 22, 2021 to October 28, 2022.

==History==

&quot;College Bowl&quot; originated as a USO activity created by Canadian Don Reid for soldiers serving in World War II. Reid and John Moses then developed the game into a radio show. Grant Tinker, later President of NBC and MTM Enterprises, got his start as an assistant on the show.

Richard Reid has led the College Bowl since 1975. He has created, produced, and supervised all versions of College Bowl innovated since then (except for a 1984 NBC special).

Two four-member teams representing various colleges and universities competed; one member of each team was its captain. The game began with a &quot;toss-up&quot; question for ten points. The first player to buzz in got the right to answer, but if the contestant was wrong, the other team could try to answer (if a player buzzed in before the host finished reading the question and was wrong, the team was penalized five points). Answering a &quot;toss-up&quot; correctly earned the team the right to answer a multi-part &quot;bonus&quot; question worth up to thirty points; the team members could collaborate, but only the captain was allowed to answer. The game continued in this manner and was played in halves. During halftime, the players were allowed to show a short promotional film of their school or they might talk about career plans or the like.

The first &quot;College Quiz Bowl&quot; match was played on NBC radio on October 10, 1953, when Northwestern University defeated Columbia University, 135–60. Twenty-six episodes ran in that first season, with winning teams receiving $500 grants for their school. &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; magazine became the sponsor for the 1954–55 season, and a short third season in the autumn of 1955 finished the run. The most dominant team was the University of Minnesota, which had teams appear in 23 of the 68 broadcast matches. The 1953–55 series had a powerful appeal because it used remote broadcasts; each team was located at their college where they were cheered on by their wildly enthusiastic classmates. The effect was akin to listening to a football game.

==Television==

Though a pilot was shot in the spring of 1955, the game did not move to television until 1959. As &quot;G.E. College Bowl&quot; with General Electric as the primary sponsor, the show ran on CBS from 1959 to 1963, and moved back to NBC from 1963 to 1970. Allen Ludden was the original host, but left to do &quot;Password&quot; full-time in 1962. Robert Earle was the moderator for the rest of the run. The norm developed in the Ludden-Earle era of undefeated teams retiring after winning five games. Each winning team earned $1,500 in scholarship grants from General Electric with runner-up teams receiving $500. A team&#x27;s fifth victory awarded $3,000 from General Electric plus $1,500 from Gimbels department stores for a grand total of $10,500. On April 16, 1967, &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine matched GE&#x27;s payouts so that each victory won $3,000 and runners-up earned $1,000. The payouts from Gimbel&#x27;s department stores remained the same so that five-time champions retired with a grand total of $19,500.

Colgate University was the first team to win five consecutive contests and become &quot;retired undefeated champions,&quot; defeating New York University in Colgate&#x27;s first appearance in April 1960 when NYU was going for its fifth win. Rutgers was the second college to win five contests and be retired. Colgate later defeated Rutgers in a special one-time playoff contest to become the only six-time winner in a &quot;five-win-limit&quot; competition. An upset occurred in 1961, when the small liberal arts colleges of Hobart and William Smith in Geneva, New York, defeated Baylor University to become the third college to retire undefeated. Pomona College began its five-game G.E. College Bowl winning streak on October 15, 1961, by first defeating Texas Christian University followed by the University of Washington, Hood College, Amherst College, and Washington and Lee University. In another surprise, Lafayette College retired undefeated in fall 1962 after beating the University of California, Berkeley for its fifth victory, a David and Goliath event. Ohio Wesleyan University retired undefeated easily beating Bard, Marymount, UCLA, Michigan Tech, and Alfred. Another upset occurred in 1966 when the all-female Agnes Scott College from Georgia defeated an all-male team from Princeton University.

The show licensed and spun off three other academic competitions in the U.S.:
*&quot;Alumni Fun&quot;, which appeared on ABC and CBS TV networks in the 1960s and featured former college students
*&quot;Bible Bowl&quot;, which has evolved into at least three separate national competitions and used the Bible as a source
*&quot;High School Bowl&quot;, which was broadcast in some local TV markets and featured high school students

==Honda Campus All-Star Challenge==

In 1989, College Bowl introduced its academic team championship for historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) called Honda Campus All-Star Challenge (HCASC) sponsored by American Honda Motor Company. From 1990 to 1995, Honda Campus All-Star Challenge was broadcast on BET, featuring the top 16 HBCUs, survivors of regional tournaments, competing in a single-elimination tournament. The game was played under the same rules as College Bowl. Starting in 1996 and until the present, HCASC has been played as a live-event national championship. Originally, sixty-four HBCUs traveled to and competed at the national championship. Now, forty-eight schools travel and compete. Due to the pandemic, in 2020 the national championship was suspended and the 2021 version was a virtual event.

In 2011, HCASC adopted the Africa Challenge format of the game created by Richard Reid: the highlights of the format were three rounds of Face-Off (Toss-up) and Bonus questions played in categories followed by a catch-up round called the Ultimate Challenge.

==International versions==
===&quot;University Challenge&quot;===

A British version of the televised College Bowl competition was launched as &quot;University Challenge&quot; in 1962. The program, presented by Bamber Gascoigne, produced by Granada Television and broadcast across the ITV network, was very popular and ran until it was taken off the air in 1987. In 1994, the show was resurrected by the BBC with Jeremy Paxman (who was also hosting &quot;Newsnight&quot; at that time) as the new quizmaster. In 2022, it was announced that Amol Rajan would be taking over as host, after Paxman announced that he was stepping down, owing to Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Since 2011, a Christmas-time edition has also existed, titled &quot;Christmas University Challenge&quot;, featuring university alumni.

===&quot;University Challenge New Zealand&quot;===

A New Zealand version of &quot;University Challenge&quot; ran from 1976 to 1989, hosted by Peter Sinclair. It had a three-year revival beginning in 2014, with Tom Conroy as host.

===&quot;University Challenge Australia&quot;===

&quot;University Challenge&quot; in Australia ran on ABC from 1987 until 1989, hosted by Magnus Clarke.

===&quot;Africa Challenge&quot;===
Launched in 2007, Africa Challenge was an international championship version of College Bowl featuring schools from across the continent that finished at the top of nationwide, non-televised championship tournaments. The format for Africa Challenge was created by Richard Reid. It featured three players playing three rounds of Face-Off and Bonus questions, and it culminated in a catch-up round called the Ultimate Challenge.

The program was sponsored by the mobile phone company Celtel, its headquarters in The Netherlands. In the first year, schools from Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda competed. In the second year schools from Malawi and Zambia were added. In the third year, schools from Ghana, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone were added. After the second year, Celtel was sold to the mobile phone company Zain, headquartered in Bahrain. The name of the game changed to &quot;Zain Africa Challenge&quot;. Season five, which was set to be telecast in 2011, failed to make it past pre-production after Zain sold its African network operations to Bharti Airtel.

===&quot;Challenging Times&quot;===

An Irish version of the competition called &quot;Challenging Times&quot; ran between 1991 and 2002. It was sponsored by The Irish Times newspaper and presented by Kevin Myers, then a columnist with that newspaper. Throughout the show, University College Cork had the most wins, with three, while National University of Ireland, Galway qualified for the most finals, winning twice and placing second twice.

==Later history==
The game returned to radio from 1979 to 1982, hosted by Art Fleming, with the 1978 and 1979 national tournament semi-finals and finals appearing on syndicated television. The two champions from those years earned $5,000 for their school and competed against teams from the UK for a $7,500 grant in the &quot;College Bowl World Championship,&quot; which was also televised. In 1978, Stanford defeated Yale with a score of 260–200 at the US Championships, earning the right to represent the US against a UK all-star team. The UK all-star team, composed of two students from Oxford, one student from Nottingham, and one from Durham, defeated the US team with a score of 385–55. The game played in 1978 between the US and the UK followed College Bowl rules. In 1979, Davidson College emerged as the winner of the US Championships and competed against Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge University under University Challenge rules. Once again, the UK team secured a win. There have been two television appearances since then; the 1984 tournament semi-finals and finals aired on NBC, hosted by Pat Sajak, and the entire 1987 tournament on Disney Channel, hosted by Dick Cavett. The University of Minnesota won both iterations.

In 1970, modern quiz bowl invitational tournaments began with the Southeastern Invitational Tournament, and the circuit expanded through the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. These tournaments increasingly made various modifications to the College Bowl format and came to be known as quiz bowl. Earlier invitational tournaments, such as the &quot;Syra-quiz&quot; at Syracuse University, had occurred in the 1950s and 1960s. 

In 1976, the program became affiliated with the Association of College Unions International (ACUI), which continued to promote the competition as a non-broadcast event after the demise of the radio and television experiments. That affiliation ended in 2008, and the College Bowl campus program is no longer active. The College Bowl Company continues to create, produce and license versions of College Bowl in the United States and elsewhere, including &quot;Africa Challenge&quot; (2007–10), which featured schools from Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia; &quot;University Challenge&quot; in New Zealand and India; &quot;University Challenge&quot; in the United Kingdom, which is seen every week in primetime on BBC 2; and the Honda Campus All-Star Challenge at historically black colleges and universities, sponsored by American Honda, which has awarded over $10,000,000 in institutional grants since its debut in 1989.

In the 1990s with the rise of the Academic Competition Federation and National Academic Quiz Tournaments, both with their national championships, several schools (such as the University of Maryland, the University of Chicago, both former national champions, and recent runner up Georgia Tech) &quot;de-affiliated&quot; from College Bowl. Factors that contributed to this process included, among other issues, eligibility rules for College Bowl (which limited the number of graduate students who could compete and required a minimum course load), higher participation costs for College Bowl relative to these other formats, and concerns regarding the quality and difficulty of the questions used in College Bowl competitions.

==2021 revival==
On November 24, 2020, it was announced that a 10-episode revival of the series had been ordered at NBC, with Peyton Manning as host (and producer) and his brother Cooper serving as sidekick. The revival, titled &quot;Capital One College Bowl&quot;, premiered on June 22, 2021. Twelve teams compete for $1 million in scholarship funds; each team fields four players, three starters and one alternate who can be brought in if a starter has to withdraw for any reason.

On April 28, 2022, NBC renewed the series for a second season, with Harry Friedman being named executive producer. The second season premiered on September 9, 2022.

===Gameplay===

The game is played using a modified version of the current &quot;Honda Campus All-Star Challenge&quot; rules, between two teams of three players, with no penalty for wrong answers. In each of the first two rounds, the teams are shown four categories. This round was known as the &quot;Face-Off&quot; in season one but was renamed the &quot;Kickoff&quot; in season two, with only one round being played. Each category contains one &quot;Face-Off&quot; question and two bonus &quot;Follow-Up&quot; questions, all worth 10 points each. The Face-Off questions are asked on the buzzers to all players, with no conferring allowed. The first player to buzz in and answer correctly wins control of the Follow-Ups, for which conferring is allowed. An incorrect response at any time gives the opposing team a chance to steal the points with a correct answer. In season two, a category that was used is replaced with a new one. One category is secretly designated as &quot;Extra Credit,&quot; awarding 20 points per question if chosen. This was removed in the second season. Each of these rounds ends after three categories have been played.

A random draw decides which team will choose first in Round 1, and the trailing team at the end of this round chooses first in Round 2. During both rounds, the team that correctly answers the Face-Off question in a category earns the right to select the next one, regardless of the outcome of the Follow-Ups.

The second &quot;Kickoff&quot; round was replaced in season two by a new round dubbed &quot;One-on-One,&quot; in which three categories, each with three questions, are shown and both teams determine who will participate. Correct answers are worth 20 points, while an incorrect response gives the opponent control.

The third and final round is the &quot;Two-Minute Drill,&quot; in which each team has two minutes to answer as many questions as possible. In season one, teams chose their categories (&quot;majors&quot;) from a group of six before the game began, and the trailing team went first. Teammates may confer on the questions, but only the captain may buzz in and answer. Each correct response scores 25 points, and a bonus is awarded after every fifth such answer, starting with 50 for the fifth and increasing by 25 for each additional set of five. The bonus was set to a flat 100 points in the second season.

Each qualifying contest consists of two complete games, with two new teams per game. The two highest-scoring teams from each contest advance to an eight-team elimination bracket, regardless of whether they won their respective games. The two highest scorers from the remaining six teams also advance as wild cards.

All matches beyond the qualifiers in the first season had three Face-Off rounds, with five categories available; each round ended when four of them have been played. The higher-seeded team in each match starts the first round. In season one, the Face-Offs were followed by a &quot;Dropout Round,&quot; in which the host asks a question with multiple correct answers (e.g. naming the 30 teams in the NBA) and calls on one member at a time from alternating teams to respond. A miss or repetition of any previously given answer eliminates the contestant from the round. When called on, a contestant may challenge any one opposing team member to respond instead; if the opponent gives a correct answer, the challenger is eliminated. The first team to be eliminated must choose one of its members to sit out the Two-Minute Drill, while the opposing team plays the round with all three.

The &quot;Dropout Round&quot; was replaced in season two starting with the quarterfinals with a new round dubbed &quot;The Handoff,&quot; in which three categories each feature a question with three correct answers. The trailing team goes first. Each correct response is worth 20 points, while an incorrect response moves on to the next teammate until all three chances have finished. Just like &quot;The Knockout,&quot; a used category gets replaced with a new one. In subsequent turns, the contestant in the position corresponding to the question number goes first. The round ends after six questions.

In season two, a new round was added in between the quarterfinals and semifinals, called &quot;The Blitz,&quot; consisting of the Kickoff and Two-Minute Drill. 3 matches are played, with the winner of each advancing to the semifinals, along with the runner-up team that scored the most points.

In the second season&#x27;s semifinals, a new round dubbed &quot;Pass-Play&quot; was introduced. In this round, two categories are shown, and the controlling team chooses which one to play, with the remaining category being given to the opposing team. The trailing team goes first. Correct answers are worth 20 points, while an incorrect answer awards the opponents those points. The round consists of eight questions, with the latter half including two &quot;Extra Credit&quot; categories that not only double the points but also feature two answers.

In season one, members of teams eliminated in the qualifiers, quarterfinals, or semifinals each receive $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000, respectively. In season two, members of teams eliminated in the qualifiers, quarterfinals, &quot;The Blitz,&quot; or semifinals each receive $5,000, $10,000, $15,000, or $20,000 respectively. Members of the tournament champion and runner-up teams each receive $125,000 and $25,000, respectively. Alternates receive the same monetary award as their teammates. In addition, four contestants are chosen to receive $5,000 Merit Awards based on their character and leadership ability.

==In popular culture==
* In 2009, brief scenes from the early 1960s episodes of &quot;College Bowl&quot; with Allen Ludden appeared in the film &quot;Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story&quot;. 
* A brief scene of &quot;GE College Bowl&quot; with Allen Ludden appeared in the 1982 film &quot;Diner&quot;.

==Criticism==
In the 1987 regional tournament, College Bowl was accused of recycling questions from previous tournaments, thereby possibly compromising the integrity of results. Questions for tournaments need to be new for all teams involved, or certain teams could have a competitive advantage from having heard some questions previously. The 1987 National Tournament on the Disney Channel saw additional controversy, as several protested matches proved to strain the television format. Especially in the early 1990s, The College Bowl Company attempted to collect licensing fees based on copyright and trade dress claims from invitational tournaments that employed formats that it claimed were similar to College Bowl and threatened not to allow schools that failed to pay these fees to compete in College Bowl events. As it was, the company&#x27;s intellectual property claims were never tested in court. These events and the growing Internet community of quiz bowl players led to a great increase in teams, tournaments, and formats.

==Top four finishers of CBI National Championship Tournament (1978–2008)==

::Source: &quot;NCT Results: Season = 1977-1978 to 2007-2008&quot;
No tournament was held in 1983 or 1985, though regional tournaments were held each year.

†Tied for third (lost in semifinals, no playoff for third place).

††In 1994, Brigham Young University finished second in the round-robin, qualifying for the final series. However, as the final best-two-out-of-three series was held on Sunday, the team declined to participate, and the University of Virginia took their place instead. Brigham Young was awarded third place.

<text>Cox&#x27;s theorem, named after the physicist Richard Threlkeld Cox, is a derivation of the laws of probability theory from a certain set of postulates. This derivation justifies the so-called &quot;logical&quot; interpretation of probability, as the laws of probability derived by Cox&#x27;s theorem are applicable to any proposition. Logical (also known as objective Bayesian) probability is a type of Bayesian probability. Other forms of Bayesianism, such as the subjective interpretation, are given other justifications.

==Cox&#x27;s assumptions==
Cox wanted his system to satisfy the following conditions:

#Divisibility and comparability – The plausibility of a proposition is a real number and is dependent on information we have related to the proposition.
#Common sense – Plausibilities should vary sensibly with the assessment of plausibilities in the model.
#Consistency – If the plausibility of a proposition can be derived in many ways, all the results must be equal.

The postulates as stated here are taken from Arnborg and Sjödin.
&quot;Common sense&quot; includes consistency with Aristotelian logic in the sense that logically equivalent propositions shall have the same plausibility.

The postulates as originally stated by Cox were not mathematically
rigorous (although more so than the informal description above),
as noted by Halpern. However it appears to be possible
to augment them with various mathematical assumptions made either
implicitly or explicitly by Cox to produce a valid proof.

Cox&#x27;s notation:
:The plausibility of a proposition formula_1 given some related information formula_2 is denoted by formula_3.

Cox&#x27;s postulates and functional equations are:
*The plausibility of the conjunction formula_4 of two propositions formula_1, formula_6, given some related information formula_2, is determined by the plausibility of formula_1 given formula_2 and that of formula_6 given formula_11.
:In form of a functional equation
::formula_12
:Because of the associative nature of the conjunction in propositional logic, the consistency with logic gives a functional equation saying that the function formula_13 is an associative binary operation.
*Additionally, Cox postulates the function formula_13 to be monotonic.
:All strictly increasing associative binary operations on the real numbers are isomorphic to multiplication of numbers in a subinterval of , which means that there is a monotonic function formula_15 mapping plausibilities to such that
::formula_16
*In case formula_1 given formula_2 is certain, we have formula_19 and formula_20 due to the requirement of consistency. The general equation then leads to
:formula_21
:This shall hold for any proposition formula_6, which leads to
::formula_23
*In case formula_1 given formula_2 is impossible, we have formula_26 and formula_27 due to the requirement of consistency. The general equation (with the A and B factors switched) then leads to
:formula_28
:This shall hold for any proposition formula_6, which, without loss of generality, leads to a solution
::formula_30
::Due to the requirement of monotonicity, this means that formula_15 maps plausibilities to interval .

*The plausibility of a proposition determines the plausibility of the proposition&#x27;s negation.
:This postulates the existence of a function formula_32 such that
::formula_33
:Because &quot;a double negative is an affirmative&quot;, consistency with logic gives a functional equation
::formula_34
:saying that the function formula_32 is an involution, i.e., it is its own inverse.
*Furthermore, Cox postulates the function formula_32 to be monotonic.

:The above functional equations and consistency with logic imply that
::formula_37
:Since formula_4 is logically equivalent to formula_39, we also get
::formula_40

:If, in particular, formula_41, then also formula_42 and formula_43 and we get
::formula_44
:and
::formula_45
:Abbreviating formula_46 and formula_47 we get the functional equation
::formula_48

==Implications of Cox&#x27;s postulates==
The laws of probability derivable from these postulates are the following. Let formula_49 be the plausibility of the proposition formula_1 given formula_6 satisfying Cox&#x27;s postulates. Then there is a function formula_15 mapping plausibilities to interval [0,1] and a positive number formula_53 such that

# Certainty is represented by formula_54
# formula_55
# formula_56

It is important to note that the postulates imply only these general properties. We may recover the usual laws of probability by setting a new function, conventionally denoted formula_57 or formula_58, equal to formula_59. Then we obtain the laws of probability in a more familiar form:

# Certain truth is represented by formula_60, and certain falsehood by formula_61
# formula_62
# formula_63

Rule 2 is a rule for negation, and rule 3 is a rule for conjunction. Given that any proposition containing conjunction, disjunction, and negation can be equivalently rephrased using conjunction and negation alone (the conjunctive normal form), we can now handle any compound proposition.

The laws thus derived yield finite additivity of probability, but not countable additivity. The measure-theoretic formulation of Kolmogorov assumes that a probability measure is countably additive. This slightly stronger condition is necessary for certain results. An elementary example (in which this assumption merely simplifies the calculation rather than being necessary for it) is that the probability of seeing heads for the first time after an even number of flips in a sequence of coin flips is formula_64.

==Interpretation and further discussion==
Cox&#x27;s theorem has come to be used as one of the justifications for the use of Bayesian probability theory. For example, in Jaynes it is discussed in detail in chapters 1 and 2 and is a cornerstone for the rest of the book. Probability is interpreted as a formal system of logic, the natural extension of Aristotelian logic (in which every statement is either true or false) into the realm of reasoning in the presence of uncertainty.

It has been debated to what degree the theorem excludes alternative models for reasoning about uncertainty. For example, if certain &quot;unintuitive&quot; mathematical assumptions were dropped then alternatives could be devised, e.g., an example provided by Halpern. However Arnborg and Sjödin suggest additional
&quot;common sense&quot; postulates, which would allow the assumptions to be relaxed in some cases while still ruling out the Halpern example. Other approaches were devised by Hardy or Dupré and Tipler.

The original formulation of Cox&#x27;s theorem is in , which is extended with additional results and more discussion in . Jaynes cites Abel for the first known use of the associativity functional equation. János Aczél provides a long proof of the &quot;associativity equation&quot; (pages 256-267). Jaynes reproduces the shorter proof by Cox in which differentiability is assumed. A guide to Cox&#x27;s theorem by Van Horn aims at comprehensively introducing the reader to all these references.

Baoding Liu, the founder of uncertainty theory, criticizes Cox&#x27;s theorem for presuming that the truth value of conjunction formula_65 is a twice differentiable function formula_32 of truth values of the two propositions formula_57 and formula_68, i.e., formula_69, which excludes uncertainty theory&#x27;s &quot;uncertain measure&quot; from its start, because the function formula_70, used in uncertainty theory, is not differentiable with respect to formula_71 and formula_72. According to Liu, &quot;there does not exist any evidence that the truth value of conjunction is completely determined by the truth values of individual propositions, let alone a twice differentiable function.&quot;

<text>Ohm&#x27;s law states that the electric current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the resistance, one arrives at the three mathematical equations used to describe this relationship:

formula_1

where is the current through the conductor, &quot;V&quot; is the voltage measured across the conductor and &quot;R&quot; is the resistance of the conductor. More specifically, Ohm&#x27;s law states that the &quot;R&quot; in this relation is constant, independent of the current. If the resistance is not constant, the previous equation cannot be called &quot;Ohm&#x27;s law&quot;, but it can still be used as a definition of static/DC resistance. Ohm&#x27;s law is an empirical relation which accurately describes the conductivity of the vast majority of electrically conductive materials over many orders of magnitude of current. However some materials do not obey Ohm&#x27;s law; these are called non-ohmic.

The law was named after the German physicist Georg Ohm, who, in a treatise published in 1827, described measurements of applied voltage and current through simple electrical circuits containing various lengths of wire. Ohm explained his experimental results by a slightly more complex equation than the modern form above (see &quot;&quot; below).

In physics, the term &quot;Ohm&#x27;s law&quot; is also used to refer to various generalizations of the law; for example the vector form of the law used in electromagnetics and material science:

formula_2

where J is the current density at a given location in a resistive material, E is the electric field at that location, and &quot;σ&quot; (sigma) is a material-dependent parameter called the conductivity, defined as the inverse of resistivity &quot;ρ&quot; (rho). This reformulation of Ohm&#x27;s law is due to Gustav Kirchhoff.

==History==

In January 1781, before Georg Ohm&#x27;s work, Henry Cavendish experimented with Leyden jars and glass tubes of varying diameter and length filled with salt solution. He measured the current by noting how strong a shock he felt as he completed the circuit with his body. Cavendish wrote that the &quot;velocity&quot; (current) varied directly as the &quot;degree of electrification&quot; (voltage). He did not communicate his results to other scientists at the time, and his results were unknown until James Clerk Maxwell published them in 1879.

Francis Ronalds delineated &quot;intensity&quot; (voltage) and &quot;quantity&quot; (current) for the dry pile—a high voltage source—in 1814 using a gold-leaf electrometer. He found for a dry pile that the relationship between the two parameters was not proportional under certain meteorological conditions.

Ohm did his work on resistance in the years 1825 and 1826, and published his results in 1827 as the book &quot;Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet&quot; (&quot;The galvanic circuit investigated mathematically&quot;). He drew considerable inspiration from Joseph Fourier&#x27;s work on heat conduction in the theoretical explanation of his work. For experiments, he initially used voltaic piles, but later used a thermocouple as this provided a more stable voltage source in terms of internal resistance and constant voltage. He used a galvanometer to measure current, and knew that the voltage between the thermocouple terminals was proportional to the junction temperature. He then added test wires of varying length, diameter, and material to complete the circuit. He found that his data could be modeled through the equation
formula_3
where &quot;x&quot; was the reading from the galvanometer, &quot;ℓ&quot; was the length of the test conductor, &quot;a&quot; depended on the thermocouple junction temperature, and &quot;b&quot; was a constant of the entire setup. From this, Ohm determined his law of proportionality and published his results.

In modern notation we would write,
formula_4
where formula_5 is the open-circuit emf of the thermocouple, formula_6 is the internal resistance of the thermocouple and formula_7 is the resistance of the test wire. In terms of the length of the wire this becomes,
formula_8
where formula_9 is the resistance of the test wire per unit length. Thus, Ohm&#x27;s coefficients are,
formula_10

Ohm&#x27;s law was probably the most important of the early quantitative descriptions of the physics of electricity. We consider it almost obvious today. When Ohm first published his work, this was not the case; critics reacted to his treatment of the subject with hostility. They called his work a &quot;web of naked fancies&quot; and the Minister of Education proclaimed that &quot;a professor who preached such heresies was unworthy to teach science.&quot; The prevailing scientific philosophy in Germany at the time asserted that experiments need not be performed to develop an understanding of nature because nature is so well ordered, and that scientific truths may be deduced through reasoning alone. Also, Ohm&#x27;s brother Martin, a mathematician, was battling the German educational system. These factors hindered the acceptance of Ohm&#x27;s work, and his work did not become widely accepted until the 1840s. However, Ohm received recognition for his contributions to science well before he died.

In the 1850s, Ohm&#x27;s law was widely known and considered proved. Alternatives such as &quot;Barlow&#x27;s law&quot;, were discredited, in terms of real applications to telegraph system design, as discussed by Samuel F. B. Morse in 1855.

The electron was discovered in 1897 by J. J. Thomson, and it was quickly realized that it was the particle (charge carrier) that carried electric currents in electric circuits. In 1900, the first (classical) model of electrical conduction, the Drude model, was proposed by Paul Drude, which finally gave a scientific explanation for Ohm&#x27;s law. In this model, a solid conductor consists of a stationary lattice of atoms (ions), with conduction electrons moving randomly in it. A voltage across a conductor causes an electric field, which accelerates the electrons in the direction of the electric field, causing a drift of electrons which is the electric current. However the electrons collide with atoms which causes them to scatter and randomizes their motion, thus converting kinetic energy to heat (thermal energy). Using statistical distributions, it can be shown that the average drift velocity of the electrons, and thus the current, is proportional to the electric field, and thus the voltage, over a wide range of voltages.

The development of quantum mechanics in the 1920s modified this picture somewhat, but in modern theories the average drift velocity of electrons can still be shown to be proportional to the electric field, thus deriving Ohm&#x27;s law. In 1927 Arnold Sommerfeld applied the quantum Fermi-Dirac distribution of electron energies to the Drude model, resulting in the free electron model. A year later, Felix Bloch showed that electrons move in waves (Bloch electrons) through a solid crystal lattice, so scattering off the lattice atoms as postulated in the Drude model is not a major process; the electrons scatter off impurity atoms and defects in the material. The final successor, the modern quantum band theory of solids, showed that the electrons in a solid cannot take on any energy as assumed in the Drude model but are restricted to energy bands, with gaps between them of energies that electrons are forbidden to have. The size of the band gap is a characteristic of a particular substance which has a great deal to do with its electrical resistivity, explaining why some substances are electrical conductors, some semiconductors, and some insulators.

While the old term for electrical conductance, the mho (the inverse of the resistance unit ohm), is still used, a new name, the siemens, was adopted in 1971, honoring Ernst Werner von Siemens. The siemens is preferred in formal papers.

In the 1920s, it was discovered that the current through a practical resistor actually has statistical fluctuations, which depend on temperature, even when voltage and resistance are exactly constant; this fluctuation, now known as Johnson–Nyquist noise, is due to the discrete nature of charge. This thermal effect implies that measurements of current and voltage that are taken over sufficiently short periods of time will yield ratios of V/I that fluctuate from the value of R implied by the time average or ensemble average of the measured current; Ohm&#x27;s law remains correct for the average current, in the case of ordinary resistive materials.

Ohm&#x27;s work long preceded Maxwell&#x27;s equations and any understanding of frequency-dependent effects in AC circuits. Modern developments in electromagnetic theory and circuit theory do not contradict Ohm&#x27;s law when they are evaluated within the appropriate limits.

==Scope==
Ohm&#x27;s law is an empirical law, a generalization from many experiments that have shown that current is approximately proportional to electric field for most materials. It is less fundamental than Maxwell&#x27;s equations and is not always obeyed. Any given material will break down under a strong-enough electric field, and some materials of interest in electrical engineering are &quot;non-ohmic&quot; under weak fields.

Ohm&#x27;s law has been observed on a wide range of length scales. In the early 20th century, it was thought that Ohm&#x27;s law would fail at the atomic scale, but experiments have not borne out this expectation. As of 2012, researchers have demonstrated that Ohm&#x27;s law works for silicon wires as small as four atoms wide and one atom high.

==Microscopic origins==


The dependence of the current density on the applied electric field is essentially quantum mechanical in nature; (see Classical and quantum conductivity.) A qualitative description leading to Ohm&#x27;s law can be based upon classical mechanics using the Drude model developed by Paul Drude in 1900.

The Drude model treats electrons (or other charge carriers) like pinballs bouncing among the ions that make up the structure of the material. Electrons will be accelerated in the opposite direction to the electric field by the average electric field at their location. With each collision, though, the electron is deflected in a random direction with a velocity that is much larger than the velocity gained by the electric field. The net result is that electrons take a zigzag path due to the collisions, but generally drift in a direction opposing the electric field.

The drift velocity then determines the electric current density and its relationship to E and is independent of the collisions. Drude calculated the average drift velocity from p = −&quot;eEτ&quot; where p is the average momentum, −&quot;e&quot; is the charge of the electron and τ is the average time between the collisions. Since both the momentum and the current density are proportional to the drift velocity, the current density becomes proportional to the applied electric field; this leads to Ohm&#x27;s law.

==Hydraulic analogy==

A hydraulic analogy is sometimes used to describe Ohm&#x27;s law. Water pressure, measured by pascals (or PSI), is the analog of voltage because establishing a water pressure difference between two points along a (horizontal) pipe causes water to flow. The water volume flow rate, as in liters per second, is the analog of current, as in coulombs per second. Finally, flow restrictors—such as apertures placed in pipes between points where the water pressure is measured—are the analog of resistors. We say that the rate of water flow through an aperture restrictor is proportional to the difference in water pressure across the restrictor. Similarly, the rate of flow of electrical charge, that is, the electric current, through an electrical resistor is proportional to the difference in voltage measured across the resistor. More generally, the hydraulic head may be taken as the analog of voltage, and Ohm&#x27;s law is then analogous to Darcy&#x27;s law which relates hydraulic head to the volume flow rate via the hydraulic conductivity.

Flow and pressure variables can be calculated in fluid flow network with the use of the hydraulic ohm analogy. The method can be applied to both steady and transient flow situations. In the linear laminar flow region, Poiseuille&#x27;s law describes the hydraulic resistance of a pipe, but in the turbulent flow region the pressure–flow relations become nonlinear.

The hydraulic analogy to Ohm&#x27;s law has been used, for example, to approximate blood flow through the circulatory system.

==Circuit analysis==

In circuit analysis, three equivalent expressions of Ohm&#x27;s law are used interchangeably:

formula_11

Each equation is quoted by some sources as the defining relationship of Ohm&#x27;s law,
or all three are quoted, or derived from a proportional form,
or even just the two that do not correspond to Ohm&#x27;s original statement may sometimes be given.

The interchangeability of the equation may be represented by a triangle, where &quot;V&quot; (voltage) is placed on the top section, the &quot;I&quot; (current) is placed to the left section, and the &quot;R&quot; (resistance) is placed to the right. The divider between the top and bottom sections indicates division (hence the division bar).

===Resistive circuits===
Resistors are circuit elements that impede the passage of electric charge in agreement with Ohm&#x27;s law, and are designed to have a specific resistance value &quot;R&quot;. In schematic diagrams, a resistor is shown as a long rectangle or zig-zag symbol. An element (resistor or conductor) that behaves according to Ohm&#x27;s law over some operating range is referred to as an &quot;ohmic device&quot; (or an &quot;ohmic resistor&quot;) because Ohm&#x27;s law and a single value for the resistance suffice to describe the behavior of the device over that range.

Ohm&#x27;s law holds for circuits containing only resistive elements (no capacitances or inductances) for all forms of driving voltage or current, regardless of whether the driving voltage or current is constant (DC) or time-varying such as AC. At any instant of time Ohm&#x27;s law is valid for such circuits.

Resistors which are in &quot;series&quot; or in &quot;parallel&quot; may be grouped together into a single &quot;equivalent resistance&quot; in order to apply Ohm&#x27;s law in analyzing the circuit.

===Reactive circuits with time-varying signals===

When reactive elements such as capacitors, inductors, or transmission lines are involved in a circuit to which AC or time-varying voltage or current is applied, the relationship between voltage and current becomes the solution to a differential equation, so Ohm&#x27;s law (as defined above) does not directly apply since that form contains only resistances having value &quot;R&quot;, not complex impedances which may contain capacitance (&quot;C&quot;) or inductance (&quot;L&quot;).

Equations for time-invariant AC circuits take the same form as Ohm&#x27;s law. However, the variables are generalized to complex numbers and the current and voltage waveforms are complex exponentials.

In this approach, a voltage or current waveform takes the form &quot;Ae&quot;, where &quot;t&quot; is time, &quot;s&quot; is a complex parameter, and &quot;A&quot; is a complex scalar. In any linear time-invariant system, all of the currents and voltages can be expressed with the same &quot;s&quot; parameter as the input to the system, allowing the time-varying complex exponential term to be canceled out and the system described algebraically in terms of the complex scalars in the current and voltage waveforms.

The complex generalization of resistance is impedance, usually denoted &quot;Z&quot;; it can be shown that for an inductor,
formula_12
and for a capacitor,
formula_13

We can now write,
formula_14
where &quot;V&quot; and &quot;I&quot; are the complex scalars in the voltage and current respectively and &quot;Z&quot; is the complex impedance.

This form of Ohm&#x27;s law, with &quot;Z&quot; taking the place of &quot;R&quot;, generalizes the simpler form. When &quot;Z&quot; is complex, only the real part is responsible for dissipating heat.

In a general AC circuit, &quot;Z&quot; varies strongly with the frequency parameter &quot;s&quot;, and so also will the relationship between voltage and current.

For the common case of a steady sinusoid, the &quot;s&quot; parameter is taken to be formula_15, corresponding to a complex sinusoid formula_16. The real parts of such complex current and voltage waveforms describe the actual sinusoidal currents and voltages in a circuit, which can be in different phases due to the different complex scalars.

===Linear approximations===
Ohm&#x27;s law is one of the basic equations used in the analysis of electrical circuits. It applies to both metal conductors and circuit components (resistors) specifically made for this behaviour. Both are ubiquitous in electrical engineering. Materials and components that obey Ohm&#x27;s law are described as &quot;ohmic&quot; which means they produce the same value for resistance (&quot;R&quot; = &quot;V&quot;/&quot;I&quot;) regardless of the value of &quot;V&quot; or &quot;I&quot; which is applied and whether the applied voltage or current is DC (direct current) of either positive or negative polarity or AC (alternating current).

In a true ohmic device, the same value of resistance will be calculated from &quot;R&quot; = &quot;V&quot;/&quot;I&quot; regardless of the value of the applied voltage &quot;V&quot;. That is, the ratio of &quot;V&quot;/&quot;I&quot; is constant, and when current is plotted as a function of voltage the curve is &quot;linear&quot; (a straight line). If voltage is forced to some value &quot;V&quot;, then that voltage &quot;V&quot; divided by measured current &quot;I&quot; will equal &quot;R&quot;. Or if the current is forced to some value &quot;I&quot;, then the measured voltage &quot;V&quot; divided by that current &quot;I&quot; is also &quot;R&quot;. Since the plot of &quot;I&quot; versus &quot;V&quot; is a straight line, then it is also true that for any set of two different voltages &quot;V&quot;1 and &quot;V&quot;2 applied across a given device of resistance &quot;R&quot;, producing currents &quot;I&quot;1 = &quot;V&quot;1/&quot;R&quot; and &quot;I&quot;2 = &quot;V&quot;2/&quot;R&quot;, that the ratio (&quot;V&quot;1 − &quot;V&quot;2)/(&quot;I&quot;1 − &quot;I&quot;2) is also a constant equal to &quot;R&quot;. The operator &quot;delta&quot; (Δ) is used to represent a difference in a quantity, so we can write Δ&quot;V&quot; = &quot;V&quot;1 − &quot;V&quot;2 and Δ&quot;I&quot; = &quot;I&quot;1 − &quot;I&quot;2. Summarizing, for any truly ohmic device having resistance &quot;R&quot;, &quot;V&quot;/&quot;I&quot; = Δ&quot;V&quot;/Δ&quot;I&quot; = &quot;R&quot; for any applied voltage or current or for the difference between any set of applied voltages or currents.

There are, however, components of electrical circuits which do not obey Ohm&#x27;s law; that is, their relationship between current and voltage (their &quot;I&quot;–&quot;V&quot; curve) is &quot;nonlinear&quot; (or non-ohmic). An example is the p–n junction diode (curve at right). As seen in the figure, the current does not increase linearly with applied voltage for a diode. One can determine a value of current (&quot;I&quot;) for a given value of applied voltage (&quot;V&quot;) from the curve, but not from Ohm&#x27;s law, since the value of &quot;resistance&quot; is not constant as a function of applied voltage. Further, the current only increases significantly if the applied voltage is positive, not negative. The ratio &quot;V&quot;/&quot;I&quot; for some point along the nonlinear curve is sometimes called the &quot;static&quot;, or &quot;chordal&quot;, or DC, resistance, but as seen in the figure the value of total over total varies depending on the particular point along the nonlinear curve which is chosen. This means the &quot;DC resistance&quot; V/I at some point on the curve is not the same as what would be determined by applying an AC signal having peak amplitude volts or amps centered at that same point along the curve and measuring . However, in some diode applications, the AC signal applied to the device is small and it is possible to analyze the circuit in terms of the &quot;dynamic&quot;, &quot;small-signal&quot;, or &quot;incremental&quot; resistance, defined as the one over the slope of the &quot;V&quot;–&quot;I&quot; curve at the average value (DC operating point) of the voltage (that is, one over the derivative of current with respect to voltage). For sufficiently small signals, the dynamic resistance allows the Ohm&#x27;s law small signal resistance to be calculated as approximately one over the slope of a line drawn tangentially to the &quot;V&quot;–&quot;I&quot; curve at the DC operating point.

==Temperature effects==
Ohm&#x27;s law has sometimes been stated as, &quot;for a conductor in a given state, the electromotive force is proportional to the current produced. &quot;That is, that the resistance, the ratio of the applied electromotive force (or voltage) to the current, &quot;does not vary with the current strength.&quot;The qualifier &quot;in a given state&quot; is usually interpreted as meaning &quot;at a constant temperature,&quot; since the resistivity of materials is usually temperature dependent. Because the conduction of current is related to Joule heating of the conducting body, according to Joule&#x27;s first law, the temperature of a conducting body may change when it carries a current. The dependence of resistance on temperature therefore makes resistance depend upon the current in a typical experimental setup, making the law in this form difficult to directly verify. Maxwell and others worked out several methods to test the law experimentally in 1876, controlling for heating effects. Usually, the measurements of a sample resistance are carried out at low currents to prevent Joule heating. However, even a small current causes heating(cooling) at the first(second) sample contact due to the Peltier effect. The temperatures at the sample contacts become different, their difference is linear in current. The voltage drop across the circuit includes additionally the Seebeck thermoelectromotive force which again is again linear in current. As a result, there exists a thermal correction to the sample resistance even at negligibly small current. The magnitude of the correction could be comparable with the sample resistance.

==Relation to heat conductions==

Ohm&#x27;s principle predicts the flow of electrical charge (i.e. current) in electrical conductors when subjected to the influence of voltage differences; Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Fourier&#x27;s principle predicts the flow of heat in heat conductors when subjected to the influence of temperature differences.

The same equation describes both phenomena, the equation&#x27;s variables taking on different meanings in the two cases. Specifically, solving a heat conduction (Fourier) problem with &quot;temperature&quot; (the driving &quot;force&quot;) and &quot;flux of heat&quot; (the rate of flow of the driven &quot;quantity&quot;, i.e. heat energy) variables also solves an analogous electrical conduction (Ohm) problem having &quot;electric potential&quot; (the driving &quot;force&quot;) and &quot;electric current&quot; (the rate of flow of the driven &quot;quantity&quot;, i.e. charge) variables.

The basis of Fourier&#x27;s work was his clear conception and definition of thermal conductivity. He assumed that, all else being the same, the flux of heat is strictly proportional to the gradient of temperature. Although undoubtedly true for small temperature gradients, strictly proportional behavior will be lost when real materials (e.g. ones having a thermal conductivity that is a function of temperature) are subjected to large temperature gradients.

A similar assumption is made in the statement of Ohm&#x27;s law: other things being alike, the strength of the current at each point is proportional to the gradient of electric potential. The accuracy of the assumption that flow is proportional to the gradient is more readily tested, using modern measurement methods, for the electrical case than for the heat case.

==Other versions==
Ohm&#x27;s law, in the form above, is an extremely useful equation in the field of electrical/electronic engineering because it describes how voltage, current and resistance are interrelated on a &quot;macroscopic&quot; level, that is, commonly, as circuit elements in an electrical circuit. Physicists who study the electrical properties of matter at the microscopic level use a closely related and more general vector equation, sometimes also referred to as Ohm&#x27;s law, having variables that are closely related to the V, I, and R scalar variables of Ohm&#x27;s law, but which are each functions of position within the conductor. Physicists often use this continuum form of Ohm&#x27;s Law:

formula_17

where is the electric field vector with units of volts per meter (analogous to of Ohm&#x27;s law which has units of volts), is the current density vector with units of amperes per unit area (analogous to of Ohm&#x27;s law which has units of amperes), and ρ &quot;rho&quot; is the resistivity with units of ohm·meters (analogous to of Ohm&#x27;s law which has units of ohms). The above equation is also written as where &quot;sigma&quot; is the conductivity which is the reciprocal of .
The voltage between two points is defined as:
formula_18
with formula_19 the element of path along the integration of electric field vector E. If the applied E field is uniform and oriented along the length of the conductor as shown in the figure, then defining the voltage V in the usual convention of being opposite in direction to the field (see figure), and with the understanding that the voltage V is measured differentially across the length of the conductor allowing us to drop the Δ symbol, the above vector equation reduces to the scalar equation:

formula_20

Since the field is uniform in the direction of wire length, for a conductor having uniformly consistent resistivity ρ, the current density will also be uniform in any cross-sectional area and oriented in the direction of wire length, so we may write:
formula_21

Substituting the above 2 results (for &quot;E&quot; and &quot;J&quot; respectively) into the continuum form shown at the beginning of this section:
formula_22

The electrical resistance of a uniform conductor is given in terms of resistivity by:
formula_23
where &quot;ℓ&quot; is the length of the conductor in SI units of meters, is the cross-sectional area (for a round wire if is radius) in units of meters squared, and ρ is the resistivity in units of ohm·meters.

After substitution of &quot;R&quot; from the above equation into the equation preceding it, the continuum form of Ohm&#x27;s law for a uniform field (and uniform current density) oriented along the length of the conductor reduces to the more familiar form:
formula_24

A perfect crystal lattice, with low enough thermal motion and no deviations from periodic structure, would have no resistivity, but a real metal has crystallographic defects, impurities, multiple isotopes, and thermal motion of the atoms. Electrons scatter from all of these, resulting in resistance to their flow.

The more complex generalized forms of Ohm&#x27;s law are important to condensed matter physics, which studies the properties of matter and, in particular, its electronic structure. In broad terms, they fall under the topic of constitutive equations and the theory of transport coefficients.

===Magnetic effects===
If an external B-field is present and the conductor is not at rest but moving at velocity , then an extra term must be added to account for the current induced by the Lorentz force on the charge carriers.
formula_25

In the rest frame of the moving conductor this term drops out because . There is no contradiction because the electric field in the rest frame differs from the E-field in the lab frame: .
Electric and magnetic fields are relative, see Lorentz transformation.

If the current is alternating because the applied voltage or E-field varies in time, then reactance must be added to resistance to account for self-inductance, see electrical impedance. The reactance may be strong if the frequency is high or the conductor is coiled.

===Conductive fluids===
In a conductive fluid, such as a plasma, there is a similar effect. Consider a fluid moving with the velocity formula_26 in a magnetic field formula_27. The relative motion induces an electric field formula_28 which exerts electric force on the charged particles giving rise to an electric current formula_29. The equation of motion for the electron gas, with a number density formula_30, is written as
formula_31

where formula_32, formula_33 and formula_34 are the charge, mass and velocity of the electrons, respectively. Also, formula_35 is the frequency of collisions of the electrons with ions which have a velocity field formula_36. Since, the electron has a very small mass compared with that of ions, we can ignore the left hand side of the above equation to write
formula_37

where we have used the definition of the current density, and also put formula_38 which is the electrical conductivity. This equation can also be equivalently written as
formula_39
where formula_40 is the electrical resistivity. It is also common to write formula_41 instead of formula_42 which can be confusing since it is the same notation used for the magnetic diffusivity defined as formula_43.

<text>Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example: from a television broadcast).

Widely used as a form of data entry from printed paper data recordswhether passport documents, invoices, bank statements, computerized receipts, business cards, mail, printed data, or any suitable documentationit is a common method of digitizing printed texts so that they can be electronically edited, searched, stored more compactly, displayed online, and used in machine processes such as cognitive computing, machine translation, (extracted) text-to-speech, key data and text mining. OCR is a field of research in pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and computer vision.

Early versions needed to be trained with images of each character, and worked on one font at a time. Advanced systems capable of producing a high degree of accuracy for most fonts are now common, and with support for a variety of image file format inputs. Some systems are capable of reproducing formatted output that closely approximates the original page including images, columns, and other non-textual components.

==History==

Early optical character recognition may be traced to technologies involving telegraphy and creating reading devices for the blind. In 1914, Emanuel Goldberg developed a machine that read characters and converted them into standard telegraph code. Concurrently, Edmund Fournier d&#x27;Albe developed the Optophone, a handheld scanner that when moved across a printed page, produced tones that corresponded to specific letters or characters.

In the late 1920s and into the 1930s, Emanuel Goldberg developed what he called a &quot;Statistical Machine&quot; for searching microfilm archives using an optical code recognition system. In 1931, he was granted US Patent number 1,838,389 for the invention. The patent was acquired by IBM.

In 1974, Ray Kurzweil started the company Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc. and continued development of omni-font OCR, which could recognize text printed in virtually any font. (Kurzweil is often credited with inventing omni-font OCR, but it was in use by companies, including CompuScan, in the late 1960s and 1970s.) Kurzweil used the technology to create a reading machine for blind people to have a computer read text to them out loud. The device included a CCD-type flatbed scanner and a text-to-speech synthesizer. On January 13, 1976, the finished product was unveiled during a widely reported news conference headed by Kurzweil and the leaders of the National Federation of the Blind. In 1978, Kurzweil Computer Products began selling a commercial version of the optical character recognition computer program. LexisNexis was one of the first customers, and bought the program to upload legal paper and news documents onto its nascent online databases. Two years later, Kurzweil sold his company to Xerox, which eventually spun it off as Scansoft, which merged with Nuance Communications.

In the 2000s, OCR was made available online as a service (WebOCR), in a cloud computing environment, and in mobile applications like real-time translation of foreign-language signs on a smartphone. With the advent of smartphones and smartglasses, OCR can be used in internet connected mobile device applications that extract text captured using the device&#x27;s camera. These devices that do not have built-in OCR functionality will typically use an OCR API to extract the text from the image file captured by the device. The OCR API returns the extracted text, along with information about the location of the detected text in the original image back to the device app for further processing (such as text-to-speech) or display.

Various commercial and open source OCR systems are available for most common writing systems, including Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, Hebrew, Indic, Bengali (Bangla), Devanagari, Tamil, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters.

OCR engines have been developed into software applications specializing in various subjects such as receipts, invoices, checks, and legal billing documents.

The software can be used for:
* Entering data for business documents, e.g. checks, passports, invoices, bank statements and receipts
* Automatic number-plate recognition
* Passport recognition and information extraction in airports
* Automatically extracting key information from insurance documents
* Traffic-sign recognition
* Extracting business card information into a contact list
* Creating textual versions of printed documents, e.g. book scanning for Project Gutenberg
* Making electronic images of printed documents searchable, e.g. Google Books
* Converting handwriting in real-time to control a computer (pen computing)
* Defeating or testing the robustness of CAPTCHA anti-bot systems, though these are specifically designed to prevent OCR.
* Assistive technology for blind and visually impaired users
* Writing instructions for vehicles by identifying CAD images in a database that are appropriate to the vehicle design as it changes in real time
* Making scanned documents searchable by converting them to PDFs

==Types==
* Optical character recognition (OCR)targets typewritten text, one glyph or character at a time.
* Optical word recognitiontargets typewritten text, one word at a time (for languages that use a space as a word divider). Usually just called &quot;OCR&quot;.
* Intelligent character recognition (ICR)also targets handwritten printscript or cursive text one glyph or character at a time, usually involving machine learning.
* Intelligent word recognition (IWR)also targets handwritten printscript or cursive text, one word at a time. This is especially useful for languages where glyphs are not separated in cursive script.

OCR is generally an offline process, which analyses a static document. There are cloud based services which provide an online OCR API service. Handwriting movement analysis can be used as input to handwriting recognition. Instead of merely using the shapes of glyphs and words, this technique is able to capture motion, such as the order in which segments are drawn, the direction, and the pattern of putting the pen down and lifting it. This additional information can make the process more accurate. This technology is also known as &quot;online character recognition&quot;, &quot;dynamic character recognition&quot;, &quot;real-time character recognition&quot;, and &quot;intelligent character recognition&quot;.

==Techniques==

===Pre-processing===
OCR software often pre-processes images to improve the chances of successful recognition. Techniques include:
* De-skewingif the document was not aligned properly when scanned, it may need to be tilted a few degrees clockwise or counterclockwise in order to make lines of text perfectly horizontal or vertical.
* Despecklingremoval of positive and negative spots, smoothing edges
* Binarizationconversion of an image from color or greyscale to black-and-white (called a binary image because there are two colors). The task is performed as a simple way of separating the text (or any other desired image component) from the background. The task of binarization is necessary since most commercial recognition algorithms work only on binary images, as it is simpler to do so. In addition, the effectiveness of binarization influences to a significant extent the quality of character recognition, and careful decisions are made in the choice of the binarization employed for a given input image type; since the quality of the method used to obtain the binary result depends on the type of image (scanned document, scene text image, degraded historical document, etc.).
* Line removalCleaning up non-glyph boxes and lines
* Layout analysis or zoningIdentification of columns, paragraphs, captions, etc. as distinct blocks. Especially important in multi-column layouts and tables.
* Line and word detectionEstablishment of a baseline for word and character shapes, separating words as necessary.
* Script recognitionIn multilingual documents, the script may change at the level of the words and hence, identification of the script is necessary, before the right OCR can be invoked to handle the specific script.
* Character isolation or segmentationFor per-character OCR, multiple characters that are connected due to image artifacts must be separated; single characters that are broken into multiple pieces due to artifacts must be connected.
* Normalization of aspect ratio and scale

Segmentation of fixed-pitch fonts is accomplished relatively simply by aligning the image to a uniform grid based on where vertical grid lines will least often intersect black areas. For proportional fonts, more sophisticated techniques are needed because whitespace between letters can sometimes be greater than that between words, and vertical lines can intersect more than one character.

===Text recognition===
There are two basic types of core OCR algorithm, which may produce a ranked list of candidate characters.

* &quot;Matrix matching&quot; involves comparing an image to a stored glyph on a pixel-by-pixel basis; it is also known as &quot;pattern matching&quot;, &quot;pattern recognition&quot;, or &quot;image correlation&quot;. This relies on the input glyph being correctly isolated from the rest of the image, and the stored glyph being in a similar font and at the same scale. This technique works best with typewritten text and does not work well when new fonts are encountered. This is the technique early physical photocell-based OCR implemented, rather directly.
* &quot;Feature extraction&quot; decomposes glyphs into &quot;features&quot; like lines, closed loops, line direction, and line intersections. The extraction features reduces the dimensionality of the representation and makes the recognition process computationally efficient. These features are compared with an abstract vector-like representation of a character, which might reduce to one or more glyph prototypes. General techniques of feature detection in computer vision are applicable to this type of OCR, which is commonly seen in &quot;intelligent&quot; handwriting recognition and most modern OCR software. Nearest neighbour classifiers such as the k-nearest neighbors algorithm are used to compare image features with stored glyph features and choose the nearest match.

Software such as Cuneiform and Tesseract use a two-pass approach to character recognition. The second pass is known as adaptive recognition and uses the letter shapes recognized with high confidence on the first pass to better recognize the remaining letters on the second pass. This is advantageous for unusual fonts or low-quality scans where the font is distorted (e.g. blurred or faded).

, modern OCR software includes Google Docs OCR, ABBYY FineReader, and Transym. Others like OCRopus and Tesseract use neural networks which are trained to recognize whole lines of text instead of focusing on single characters.

A technique known as iterative OCR automatically crops a document into sections based on the page layout. OCR is then performed on each section individually using variable character confidence level thresholds to maximize page-level OCR accuracy. A patent from the United States Patent Office has been issued for this method.

The OCR result can be stored in the standardized ALTO format, a dedicated XML schema maintained by the United States Library of Congress. Other common formats include hOCR and PAGE XML.

===Post-processing===
OCR accuracy can be increased if the output is constrained by a lexicona list of words that are allowed to occur in a document. This might be, for example, all the words in the English language, or a more technical lexicon for a specific field. This technique can be problematic if the document contains words not in the lexicon, like proper nouns. Tesseract uses its dictionary to influence the character segmentation step, for improved accuracy.

The output stream may be a plain text stream or file of characters, but more sophisticated OCR systems can preserve the original layout of the page and produce, for example, an annotated PDF that includes both the original image of the page and a searchable textual representation.

&quot;Near-neighbor analysis&quot; can make use of co-occurrence frequencies to correct errors, by noting that certain words are often seen together. For example, &quot;Washington, D.C.&quot; is generally far more common in English than &quot;Washington DOC&quot;.

Knowledge of the grammar of the language being scanned can also help determine if a word is likely to be a verb or a noun, for example, allowing greater accuracy.

The Levenshtein Distance algorithm has also been used in OCR post-processing to further optimize results from an OCR API.

===Application-specific optimizations===
In recent years, the major OCR technology providers began to tweak OCR systems to deal more efficiently with specific types of input. Beyond an application-specific lexicon, better performance may be had by taking into account business rules, standard expression, or rich information contained in color images. This strategy is called &quot;Application-Oriented OCR&quot; or &quot;Customized OCR&quot;, and has been applied to OCR of license plates, invoices, screenshots, ID cards, driver&#x27;s licenses, and automobile manufacturing.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; has adapted the OCR technology into a proprietary tool they entitle &quot;Document Helper&quot;, that enables their interactive news team to accelerate the processing of documents that need to be reviewed. They note that it enables them to process what amounts to as many as 5,400 pages per hour in preparation for reporters to review the contents.

==Workarounds==
There are several techniques for solving the problem of character recognition by means other than improved OCR algorithms.

===Forcing better input===
Special fonts like OCR-A, OCR-B, or MICR fonts, with precisely specified sizing, spacing, and distinctive character shapes, allow a higher accuracy rate during transcription in bank check processing. Several prominent OCR engines were designed to capture text in popular fonts such as Arial or Times New Roman, and are incapable of capturing text in these fonts that are specialized and very different from popularly used fonts. As Google Tesseract can be trained to recognize new fonts, it can recognize OCR-A, OCR-B and MICR fonts.

&quot;Comb fields&quot; are pre-printed boxes that encourage humans to write more legiblyone glyph per box. These are often printed in a dropout color which can be easily removed by the OCR system.

Palm OS used a special set of glyphs, known as Graffiti, which are similar to printed English characters but simplified or modified for easier recognition on the platform&#x27;s computationally limited hardware. Users would need to learn how to write these special glyphs.

Zone-based OCR restricts the image to a specific part of a document. This is often referred to as &quot;Template OCR&quot;.

===Crowdsourcing===
Crowdsourcing humans to perform the character recognition can quickly process images like computer-driven OCR, but with higher accuracy for recognizing images than that obtained via computers. Practical systems include the Amazon Mechanical Turk and reCAPTCHA. The National Library of Finland has developed an online interface for users to correct OCRed texts in the standardized ALTO format. Crowd sourcing has also been used not to perform character recognition directly but to invite software developers to develop image processing algorithms, for example, through the use of rank-order tournaments.

==Accuracy==


Commissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the Information Science Research Institute (ISRI) had the mission to foster the improvement of automated technologies for understanding machine printed documents, and it conducted the most authoritative of the &quot;Annual Test of OCR Accuracy&quot; from 1992 to 1996.

Recognition of typewritten, Latin script text is still not 100% accurate even where clear imaging is available. One study based on recognition of 19th- and early 20th-century newspaper pages concluded that character-by-character OCR accuracy for commercial OCR software varied from 81% to 99%; total accuracy can be achieved by human review or Data Dictionary Authentication. Other areasincluding recognition of hand printing, cursive handwriting, and printed text in other scripts (especially those East Asian language characters which have many strokes for a single character)are still the subject of active research. The MNIST database is commonly used for testing systems&#x27; ability to recognize handwritten digits.

Accuracy rates can be measured in several ways, and how they are measured can greatly affect the reported accuracy rate. For example, if word context (a lexicon of words) is not used to correct software finding non-existent words, a character error rate of 1% (99% accuracy) may result in an error rate of 5% or worse if the measurement is based on whether each whole word was recognized with no incorrect letters. Using a large enough dataset is important in a neural-network-based handwriting recognition solutions. On the other hand, producing natural datasets is very complicated and time-consuming.

An example of the difficulties inherent in digitizing old text is the inability of OCR to differentiate between the &quot;long s&quot; and &quot;f&quot; characters.

Web-based OCR systems for recognizing hand-printed text on the fly have become well known as commercial products in recent years (see Tablet PC history). Accuracy rates of 80% to 90% on neat, clean hand-printed characters can be achieved by pen computing software, but that accuracy rate still translates to dozens of errors per page, making the technology useful only in very limited applications.

Recognition of cursive text is an active area of research, with recognition rates even lower than that of hand-printed text. Higher rates of recognition of general cursive script will likely not be possible without the use of contextual or grammatical information. For example, recognizing entire words from a dictionary is easier than trying to parse individual characters from script. Reading the &quot;Amount&quot; line of a check (which is always a written-out number) is an example where using a smaller dictionary can increase recognition rates greatly. The shapes of individual cursive characters themselves simply do not contain enough information to accurately (greater than 98%) recognize all handwritten cursive script.

Most programs allow users to set &quot;confidence rates&quot;. This means that if the software does not achieve their desired level of accuracy, a user can be notified for manual review.

An error introduced by OCR scanning is sometimes termed a &quot;scanno&quot; (by analogy with the term &quot;typo&quot;).

==Unicode==
Characters to support OCR were added to the Unicode Standard in June 1993, with the release of version 1.1.

Some of these characters are mapped from fonts specific to MICR, OCR-A or OCR-B.

<text>Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six is a 1998 tactical shooter video game developed and published by Red Storm Entertainment for Microsoft Windows, with later ports for the Nintendo 64, PlayStation, Mac OS, Game Boy Color, and Dreamcast. It is the first installment in the &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; series. Based on the Tom Clancy novel of the same name, the game follows Rainbow, a top secret international counterterrorist organization, and the conspiracy they unravel as they handle a seemingly random spike in terrorism.

In singleplayer, the player advances through a series of missions in a campaign. Before each mission, the player is briefed on the situation, selects and organizes their operatives and equipment, and plans their movement through the level; during missions, the player controls an operative leading computer-controlled teammates as they follow the player&#x27;s plan. In multiplayer, players cooperate in player versus environment missions or battle to complete objectives in player versus player matches. The game features realistic gameplay factors, weapon lethality, and consequences for failure, forcing players to plan their approach carefully and promoting replayability for more streamlined completion.

&quot;Rainbow Six&quot; began as a concept by Red Storm following their formation in 1996. The game was developed in parallel with the &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; novel, with a design philosophy of realism and strategy guiding all aspects of development; however, numerous setbacks stymied the game&#x27;s development and forced the developers to crunch. Though his name is in the game&#x27;s title, Tom Clancy&#x27;s involvement in &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;&#x27;s development was very minimal. Red Storm developed the PC version, while all other ports were developed by their respective companies.

&quot;Rainbow Six&quot; was released on August 21, 1998 to widespread critical acclaim, though the console ports received relatively lower ratings than the PC version. For most releases, praise was directed toward gameplay, multiplayer, immersion, and the game&#x27;s combination of strategy and action, while criticism mainly centered on AI issues, glitches, and the graphics and controls of some ports. The game sold over 200,000 copies in its first year of release and continued to sell hundreds of thousands more copies well into the early 2000s. &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; was nominated for numerous accolades and has been deemed one of the best video games of 1998. It is considered a milestone in the history of first-person shooters and made a lasting impact on the then-fledgling tactical shooter genre.

An expansion pack, &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six Mission Pack: Eagle Watch&quot;, was released on January 26, 1999. A sequel, &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear&quot;, was released in 1999. A loose mobile game remake, &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six: Shadow Vanguard&quot;, was released in 2011.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Rainbow Six&quot; is a tactical shooter, in which characters are affected by realistic factors and can be killed with a single bullet; therefore, wise tactics and planning are encouraged to complete missions over sheer force and firepower.

The game follows a campaign of several missions, with the plot being advanced in the mission briefing of each. Missions in each version differ: the PC and Game Boy Color versions have 16 missions, the Nintendo 64 port has 12 missions, the PlayStation port has 14 missions and the Dreamcast port has 21 missions. Objectives in missions include defeating enemies, rescuing hostages, defusing bombs, gathering intelligence, and planting surveillance devices. Players are encouraged to find their own ways to complete objectives using a variety of tactics and methods, ranging from stealthy infiltration to a frontal assault (except in missions where stealth is mandatory). Successful missions often last just minutes, but may require dozens of repetitions and planning changes to account for failures, new plans, or simply faster or cleaner completion.

Before each mission is a planning stage, in which the player is briefed on the situation, chooses the Rainbow operatives to be involved in the mission, organizes them into color-coded teams, and selects their weapons, equipment, and uniforms. Operatives are categorized into five classes based on their skill specializations: Assault, Demolitions, Electronics, Recon, and Sniper. The vast majority of operatives are named characters with their own backstories and skillsets, but generic &quot;reserves&quot; are also available for each class should players wish to avoid risking named operatives, although they have greatly reduced skills. In the planning stage, the player is shown a map of the area of operations to set team orders, such as AI pathing, team &quot;go&quot; codes to hold until ordered, where AI operatives will deploy equipment such as flashbangs or door breaching charges, and rules of engagement; alternatively, the player can skip this by choosing to follow a preset plan instead.

During gameplay, the player directly controls a team leader, and can use their weapons and equipment, manually lead their team, and see stats for the controlled operative and their team on the HUD. The player can take control of any alive team leader at will. Operatives and teams not under player control follow the orders given to them in the planning stage. Injured or fatigued operatives require time off after a mission to recover (they can still be used, just with lower health or reduced skills), while deceased operatives are permanently lost and cannot be used for the rest of the campaign playthrough, forcing players to plan carefully to avoid casualties.

Online multiplayer for the PC version was available on the MPlayer.com and Zone.com services. Multiplayer modes include cooperative modes, deathmatch, and team deathmatch, among others. Most other console ports lack multiplayer, though the Nintendo 64 port includes a two-player split-screen cooperative mode.

Most versions of &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; have considerable differences. The PlayStation port was developed by Rebellion and features visible weapons in first person, entirely new mission layouts, and a smaller team size (4, opposed to 8 in other versions). The Nintendo 64 port has a simpler HUD design and completely reorganized missions, including some from &quot;Eagle Watch&quot;. The Game Boy Color port is the most notable example, having radically different gameplay and presentation due to the platform&#x27;s technical limitations: gameplay is slowed and simplified, crossfire is removed, and the 3D graphics from other releases are replaced by a 2.5D top-down perspective.

==Plot==
In 1999, in response to a post-Cold War rise in terrorism, the world&#x27;s special forces units, police tactical units, and intelligence agencies form &quot;Rainbow&quot;, a covert international counterterrorist organization led by John Clark.

In 2000, Rainbow responds to a series of terrorist attacks linked to the Phoenix Group eco-terrorist organization. Rainbow&#x27;s operations against Phoenix are assisted by John Brightling, chairman of the powerful biotechnology corporation Horizon Inc., whose facilities are frequently targeted by Phoenix; Anne Lang, the Science Advisor to the President of the United States and an acquaintance of Brightling; and Catherine Winston, a biological expert working with Horizon who is rescued by Rainbow following an attack in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

After a raid on a Phoenix compound in Idaho that reveals unethical human experimentation, Rainbow learns the Phoenix Group is a front for Horizon. Viewing humanity as an environmentally destructive &quot;disease&quot;, Brightling plans to exterminate most of humanity using a highly contagious manmade strain of the Ebola virus called &quot;Brahma&quot;, sparing only his chosen few (including Lang), who will rebuild Earth into a scientific environmental utopia. To achieve this, Brightling has engineered terrorist attacks to exploit heightened terrorism concerns and secure a contract for his private security firm Global Security at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Global Security&#x27;s personnel, led by William Hendrickson, will then release Brahma at the Olympics through Stadium Australia&#x27;s cooling system, spreading the virus worldwide when the athletes and spectators return home.

After gathering intelligence and rescuing Winston from a last-ditch attempt to silence her, Rainbow apprehends Lang and Hendrickson and prevents Brahma&#x27;s release at the Olympic Village, foiling Brightling&#x27;s plans. Brightling and his collaborators flee to their Horizon Ark facility in the Amazon rainforest, where they planned to weather out the Brahma pandemic. Rainbow assaults the Ark, neutralizes Brightling&#x27;s collaborators, and takes Brightling into custody.

==Development==

The idea of the game that would become &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; originated from early concepts Red Storm Entertainment had conceived following the company&#x27;s formation in 1996. Selected from around 100 other ideas, the original concept, titled &quot;HRT&quot;, followed the FBI Hostage Rescue Team rescuing hostages from criminals and terrorists. &quot;HRT&quot; was gradually expanded in scope with the addition of covert operations and an international setting, and the game was rechristened &quot;Black Ops&quot;. With the initial FBI HRT concept dropped and gameplay branching away from just hostage rescue, multiple alternate settings were proposed for &quot;Black Ops&quot;—including World War II, 1960s spy fiction-esque Cold War espionage, the near future, and a dystopian antihero-centered story called &quot;Jackbooted Thugs&quot;—before finally settling on contemporary counterterrorism. Red Storm CEO Doug Littlejohns, a former Royal Navy submarine commander and a close friend of Tom Clancy, did not want to develop an arcade shooter with &quot;mindless violence&quot;, but also did not want a &quot;boring&quot; slow-paced strategy game, so &quot;Black Ops&quot; was designed to focus on realism and action, with a strong emphasis on planning and strategy. Lead game designer Brian Upton, recalling &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;&#x27;s development process in the May 1999 issue of &quot;Game Developer&quot;, described the game&#x27;s design philosophy from the initial concept:We knew from the start that we wanted to capture the excitement of movies such as and &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; — the thrill of watching a team of skilled specialists pull off an operation with clockwork precision. We also knew that we wanted it to be an action game with a strong strategic component — a realistic shooter that would be fun to play even without a &quot;Quake&quot; player&#x27;s twitch reflexes.&quot;Rainbow Six&quot;—both the game and the novel—originated from a discussion between Littlejohns and Clancy during a Red Storm company outing in 1996, when Littlejohns mentioned &quot;Black Ops&quot;. When Clancy mentioned that he was writing his own novel about a hostage rescue unit, their conversation led to Littlejohns noting the protracted diplomatic delays in authorizing a foreign counterterrorist unit&#x27;s deployment overseas, and he suggested the formation of a permanent counterterrorist unit that already had authorization to deploy internationally. The name &quot;Rainbow&quot; came from the term &quot;Rainbow nation&quot;, coined by Desmond Tutu to describe post-apartheid South Africa under Nelson Mandela&#x27;s presidency. &quot;Six&quot; came from the American rank code for captain (O-6); though John Clark would more accurately be described as a major general (O-8), &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; read better than &quot;Rainbow Eight&quot;. Upton objected to the addition of &quot;Six&quot;, believing having a number at the end of the title would affect a potential sequel, but he was overruled.

Following the game&#x27;s development doctrine of realism, lead level designer John Sonedecker designed each level to be as accurate and realistic to real-world architecture as possible, noting that the presence of unusual design elements seen in other less-realistic shooters, such as unnecessarily large doorways or building layouts seemingly designed for combat, would ruin the player&#x27;s immersion and affect gameplay. The development team had access to counterterrorism experts, military trainers, and technical consultants, and used their advice to ensure authenticity and streamline development by cutting mechanics deemed unrealistic or unnecessary, such as jumping. These technical advisors also provided motion capture for character animations.

By 1997, the game was very behind on schedule, and the developers began to crunch. Many developers slept in a spare room of the office, Upton&#x27;s mental health deteriorated to the point that he had a nervous breakdown that prompted company restructuring to reduce his workload, and network programmer Dave Weinstein (hired as part of the aforementioned company restructuring) was once stopped by police on suspicion of driving under the influence due to his severe exhaustion from crunch. Clancy&#x27;s involvement in development was &quot;minimal&quot;, only sending Red Storm an early manuscript of the novel to work plot details into the game (hence why the game&#x27;s plot features different characters and a slightly different storyline). Clancy would insist the developers add features his experts claimed were realistic, such as the fictional heartbeat sensor used in the novel that functions as a radar-like equipment item in-game. In November 1997, the developers realized the game was becoming too demanding, only having single-digit frame rates on high-end devices, so a massive two-month overhaul was ordered. Despite these setbacks, development managed to progress relatively smoothly overall, and a gameplay demonstration at E3 1998 that unintentionally displayed AI teammates rescuing hostages by themselves boosted the game&#x27;s publicity ahead of release.

Several weeks prior to the game&#x27;s release on PC, early copies of the game were leaked onto online piracy websites. The users that uploaded the game files reportedly &quot;took credit for &#x27;cracking&#x27; a game with no copy protection in it&quot;, frustrating the developers; Weinstein recalled going on a profanity-laden rant on the topic in Red Storm&#x27;s office, only to be pulled aside by Littlejohns for his volume, having been heard three offices away.

The Nintendo 64, PlayStation, Mac OS, Game Boy Color, and Dreamcast releases of the game were each developed by separate companies: Saffire for the N64, Rebellion Developments for the PS1, Varcon Systems for Mac OS, Crawfish Interactive for the GBC, and Pipe Dream Interactive for the Dreamcast. Saffire struggled to simplify &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;&#x27;s control scheme to suit the Nintendo 64 controller and ultimately had to completely remake the game so it would be able to run without frame rate dips on the N64. Crawfish opted to give the Game Boy Color port a unique game style, as they felt other game styles would not suit &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;&#x27;s gameplay and features on the platform. The release of Pipe Dream&#x27;s Dreamcast port was delayed by eight months.

The game&#x27;s box art, featuring a Rainbow operative armed with a Heckler &amp; Koch USP, was not created for the game and is actually a modified 1992 photograph of Heckler &amp; Koch USA sales executive John T. Meyer. The original image was used to promote the American launch of the USP in 1993. Heckler &amp; Koch permitted the use of the image for the game and sent firearms instructors to assist with motion capture.

==Release==
&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six&quot; was released for Windows on August 21, 1998, in North America and on October 23, 1998, in Europe. In North America, the game was released by Red Storm Entertainment, with SouthPeak Games handling distribution duties. Take-Two Interactive published the game in Europe. The Nintendo 64 port was released in North America on November 17, 1999, and in the United Kingdom one month later on December 10. The PlayStation conversion was released in the United Kingdom on November 19, and in North America on November 23. A port for Mac OS was released on December 1, 1999. A distinct version of the game was released for Game Boy Color in North America April 12, 2000, and in the United Kingdom on November 10, 2000. The Dreamcast port was delayed several times before being released. Initially expected to be released on September 9, 1999, as a launch title for the system, it was delayed due to the difficulties of working with Windows CE during development. The port was initially delayed to October 19, 1999, before being postponed a month again. It then went gold on November 30, 1999, with an expected release date of December 9, and was released five months later on May 3, 2000, in North America by Majesco Sales&#x27; publishing label Pipe Dream Interactive, and on February 2, 2001, in the United Kingdom by German publisher Swing! Entertainment.

After the release of the game, Tom Clancy offered to sign copies of the game for Red Storm employees, despite being relatively uninvolved in development, annoying several developers; as Upton opined, &quot;Even though it had his name on the box, it wasn&#x27;t his game. It was our game. He should have been asking us to sign a copy for him!&quot;

The PAL PlayStation port of the game was one of 20 games preloaded on the PlayStation Classic (excluding the Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong releases), released on December 3, 2018.

=== &quot;Rainbow Six Mission Pack: Eagle Watch&quot; ===
&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six Mission Pack: Eagle Watch&quot; is an expansion pack of the original game, released exclusively for Windows in North America on January 26, 1999, and in Europe in February 1999. It adds five new missions, four new operatives from the &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; novel, three new weapons, and new multiplayer modes. The new missions, unrelated to each other or the original campaign, take place in 2001 and follow Rainbow&#x27;s high-profile operations in landmark locations around the world, namely the &quot;Buran&quot; spaceplane in Russia, the Taj Mahal in India, the Forbidden City in China, the Palace of Westminster in the United Kingdom, and the Capitol in the United States. The expansion was packaged with the original game as &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six: Gold Pack Edition&quot; when it was released in 1999 in North America in June and in the United Kingdom in September. The Nintendo 64 port includes some of the missions from &quot;Eagle Watch&quot;, and the Dreamcast port contains all of them.

==Reception==
&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six&quot; was met with mostly positive reviews on PC, though the console ports received relatively lower ratings. Review aggregator Metacritic displays a score of 85 out of 100 for the PC version. Video game review aggregator GameRankings displays scores of 82% for PC, 74% for the Nintendo 64, 48% for the PlayStation, 54% for the Game Boy Color, and 73% for the Dreamcast.

Overall gameplay was positively received. The game&#x27;s difficulty and playstyle differences to contemporary shooters such as &quot;Quake II&quot; and &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; were highlighted by multiple reviewers, as was the detailed planning stage. Trent C. Ward, reviewing the PC version for &quot;IGN&quot;, praised the complexities of the planning stage, realistic damage, competent AI, and freedom to complete missions from multiple approaches, saying it was &quot;unlike any first-person shooter yet made.&quot; &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; called the game &quot;an enthralling package loaded to the brim with tense, nail-biting gameplay, slick technology, and excellent replayability&quot; and &quot;undoubtedly one of the most original and best games of the year.&quot; Jeremy Dunham of &quot;IGN&quot;, reviewing the Dreamcast port, praised the game&#x27;s change in pace, saying, &quot;Long exposed to mindless romps and pointless first-person gore-fest clones, the ability to actually think and THEN destroy puts a big ol&#x27; smile on my face.&quot; &quot;Push Square&quot; Sam Brooke, reviewing the PlayStation port in a 2018 retrospective, enjoyed the sense of accomplishment from completing challenging missions properly, calling it &quot;a trailblazer in its genre&quot;. Alan Dunkin of &quot;GameSpot&quot; noted the game could be difficult, but to the point of sometimes being frustrating.

Several reviews highlighted the game&#x27;s realism and immersion. Dunkin stated &quot;the immersive feeling of &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; is perhaps one of the best seen in a game.&quot; Christian Nutt, reviewing the Nintendo 64 port for &quot;GameSpot&quot;, said of &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;, &quot;realism is the order of the day ... this game does deliver a military simulation on a very personal level.&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; commended the game&#x27;s attempts at realism, but noted flaws in presentation such as the odd manner in which characters leaned around corners.

Multiplayer was singled out for praise, especially for the PC version. Ward praised the multiplayer functionality and its addictiveness, adding that &quot;[f]or weeks now, the offices here have literally shut down as teams from &quot;IGN-PC&quot;, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; and &quot;PC Accelerator&quot; stop what they&#x27;re doing to take each other on in a team deathmatch, or to cooperate on a difficult mission.&quot; Dunkin opined that the multiplayer &quot;saves the game&quot; from its other flaws. &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; favorably described the multiplayer functionality as &quot;tense and exciting&quot;, but suggested the quick time-to-kill could make smaller matches simple and boring. Peter Olafson of &quot;GamePro&quot; said the multiplayer was &quot;a nice-looking shooter&quot; but criticized lag issues.

AI issues and glitches were subject to considerable criticism. Raphael Liberatore, reviewing the game for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, criticized &quot;faulty AI and game-killing bugs&quot; for impeding &quot;what could have been a benchmark game—a game troubled by what it could have been.&quot; Olafson singled out the lack of variation in AI behavior, with enemies idling and teammates only moving in single-file lines. Brooke criticized AI pathfinding through narrow corridors, recounting one mission where it took longer to extract a hostage than it did to find them in the first place. Ward also recalled experiencing several glitches and instances of teammates obstructing him, but opined such issues could easily be overlooked during gameplay.

=== Console ports ===
The Nintendo 64 port was well-received by most reviewers. Aaron Boulding of &quot;IGN&quot; said the only issue with the port was the shortened campaign, but Nutt considered the short length to be acceptable, viewing the multiple difficulty levels and the co-op mode as making up for it. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; highlighted the port&#x27;s detailed graphics yet smooth framerate as impressive for the Nintendo 64, especially without having to resort to render fog. Mike Wolf of &quot;Next Generation&quot; gave it three stars out of five, stating that though it was &quot;a fantastic game&quot;, its flaws meant it was &quot;not a must-have&quot;. In a 2018 retrospective, &quot;N64 Today&quot; said the port still stood up 20 years after its release, but noted noticeable graphical issues, especially if not played on a CRT display.

The PlayStation port was widely panned as inferior to other versions. &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; gave it one star out of five. Nutt lambasted it as &quot;awkward&quot; and &quot;aesthetically bankrupt&quot;, noting its apparent abandonment of the team leadership aspect, deeming it &quot;an uninspired FPS with some weird hostage-saving minigame tacked on.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Matt White criticized its unusually poor graphics, and called it &quot;a mighty fine example for impressionable young developers of how not to handle a port.&quot; Brooke called the PlayStation port &quot;janky&quot; and &quot;unpolished&quot;, but gave it credit for the game&#x27;s influence.

The Game Boy Color version received mixed reviews. &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Craig Harris criticized it for removing risk factors such as enemy effectiveness and crossfire, thus making most planning and tactics worthless, though he commended Crawfish Interactive&#x27;s ambition in adapting a three-dimensional shooter to a two-dimensional handheld. Frank Provo of &quot;GameSpot&quot; criticized AI issues, gameplay repetition, and noticeable reuse of sprites and sounds, but still considered it a faithful version for what it was.

The Dreamcast port was very well-received. Garrett Kenyon of &quot;Next Generation&quot; gave it four stars out of five, calling it &quot;[a]n impressive PC translation that Dreamcast owners should certainly consider owning.&quot; Erik Wolpaw, reviewing the Dreamcast port for &quot;GameSpot&quot;, stated it was a faithful port of the PC game and &quot;as deep and challenging as action games get&quot;, though he criticized its long loading times, lack of multiplayer, and unusually complex method of issuing commands—over 35 exist, but require specific combinations of joystick and button inputs. Dunham had the same criticisms, noting these issues still existed in the final release despite an eight-month delay in the port&#x27;s development, but nonetheless deemed it &quot;one of the deepest, most realistic games to inhabit the Dreamcast so far.&quot;

=== &quot;Eagle Watch&quot; ===
Mike Lohrey of &quot;IGN&quot; reviewed the &quot;Eagle Watch&quot; expansion, praising its new levels and additions but criticizing AI awareness issues and inconsistent damage mechanics compared to the original game. Liberatore, who had previously panned the original game, rated &quot;Eagle Watch&quot; 4.5 out of 5, stating it &quot;vastly improved the original, AI included, making &quot;R6&quot; the standout title it deserves to be.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
The Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; for &quot;PC Action Game of the Year&quot; during the 2nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, but it lost to &quot;Half-Life&quot;. &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; was a finalist for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 1998 &quot;Best Action&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;Battlezone&quot;. The editors wrote that &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; &quot;deftly mixed strategic planning with nail-biting action as it brought the world of counterterrorist operations to life.&quot; &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; named &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; the best action game of 1998. CNN, in partnership with Games.net, named &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; one of the &quot;top 25 game downloads of 1998&quot;.

=== Sales ===
In the United States, &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; Windows release sold 218,183 copies during 1998, accounting for $8.86 million in revenue that year. The PC version&#x27;s &quot;Gold Edition&quot; release sold another 321,340 copies in the United States during 1999, and was the country&#x27;s 12th best-selling computer game that year. According to &quot;Gamasutra&quot;, &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; and &quot;Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear&quot; together sold 450,000 copies &quot;during the first half of the 2001/2002 fiscal year&quot;.

<text>Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Kass (born September 21, 1982) is an American professional snowboarder who has competed at the Olympic level. In Snowboarding at the 2002 Winter Olympics, Kass won silver in the Men&#x27;s Halfpipe.

==Career==
Kass was born in Pompton Plains, New Jersey. He was raised in the Scenic Lakes section of Vernon Township, New Jersey, and attended Vernon Township High School. He began snowboarding in the area at the age of twelve. His home slopes are what are now known as Hidden Valley and Mountain Creek ski resorts, both located in the mountains of Vernon Township and Highland Lakes. After several years of shredding around the Mid-Atlantic States, Kass entered the Okemo Mountain School in Vermont. In 2001, Kass broke out into what has become one of the most successful contest streaks in snowboarding with four US Open Championships, seven Winter X Games medals and two Olympic silver medals.

During the winter of 2006, Kass fought his way back from a slow start in the US Grand Prix Circuit to qualify for the Olympics in Torino for the second time in a row. Kass took home another silver medal with back-to-back 1080s and his signature smooth style.

Kass and his brother Matt Kass were the founders of Grenade Gloves, which specializes in snowboarding gloves, accessories, and other extreme sporting gear.

Kass is one of the stars of &quot;The Adventures of Danny and The Dingo&quot; on Fuel TV. He also has a podcast with Luke &quot;The Dingo&quot; Trembath on the Monster Energy&#x27;s YouTube channel, called &quot;Unleashed&quot;.

<doc id="49104" wikidata="Q14552696" url="?curid=49104" title="University of Minnesota System">
<text>The University of Minnesota System is a public university system with five campuses spread across the U.S. state of Minnesota.

The university system&#x27;s campuses are in the Twin Cities, Crookston, Duluth, Morris, and Rochester. The university also operates several research facilities around the state, including some large parcels of land. The Twin Cities, Crookston, Duluth, Morris and Rochester campuses are accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC). The other public system of higher education in the state is the larger Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system (Minnesota State System, previously MnSCU).

The university system receives annual funding from the State of Minnesota.

==Campuses==
The flagship Twin Cities campus is the largest in the system, with a total enrollment of 50,943 students (undergraduate, graduate, professional, and non-degree included) in fall 2018. In the same year Crookston had 2,810, Duluth had 11,040, Morris had 1,554, and Rochester had 533, bringing the system-wide total to 66,880.

The colors of the university, which are used system-wide, are maroon and gold.

===Twin Cities===
The University of Minnesota - Twin Cities (UMTC) is the largest with locations in Minneapolis and neighboring Saint Paul (actually, the suburb of Falcon Heights). The locations are connected via a dedicated bus transitway. The buildings on each campus are connected by a series of tunnels and above-ground skyways called The Gopher Way. The campus is the oldest and largest in the system and has the ninth-largest main campus student body in the United States, with 52,376 students at the start of the 2021–22 academic year.
The Minneapolis portion is the largest and has a number of colleges dedicated to a variety of subjects. The Twin Cities campus located in Minneapolis can be further subdivided into the East Bank (main portion) and West Bank, as the Mississippi River flows through it. Students become well-acquainted with the double-decker Washington Avenue Bridge that connects the two sections. There are a number of distinguished graduate and professional schools on the Minneapolis campus, notably the College of Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota Law School, Medical School, Carlson School of Management, School of Public Health, and Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs. In addition, Minneapolis houses many research facilities such as The Cancer Center.

The Twin Cities campus located in St Paul is home to the University of Minnesota College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences, University of Minnesota College of Design, and University of Minnesota College of Biological Sciences programs, the University of Minnesota School of Social Work, the College of Veterinary Medicine, and a variety of additional programs and student services. The Bell Museum of Natural History is also located on the campus in St. Paul.

The mascot for the Twin Cities campus is Goldy Gopher, and the sports teams are called the Minnesota Golden Gophers. They participate in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I and the football team participates in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). The majority of the teams compete in the Big Ten Conference, however, the women&#x27;s hockey program competes in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association.

Among the graduates from this campus are two former U.S. Vice Presidents, Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale, former NAACP president Roy Wilkins, British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, several Nobel Prize winners, several athletes such as Ric Flair, Kevin McHale, Dave Winfield, Patty Berg, Brock Lesnar, Curt Hennig, Shelton Benjamin, Bobby Jackson of the NBA, and composer Yanni. Folksinger Bob Dylan famously attended the University and was a part of its thriving &quot;West Bank&quot; music scene, but did not graduate. A wide variety of medical and technological innovations have taken place there as well. For instance, the Internet Gopher protocol was created at the Twin Cities campus. A predecessor of sorts to the World Wide Web, it was named after the school mascot.

Campus media includes the &quot;Minnesota Daily&quot; newspaper, &quot;The Wake Student Magazine&quot;, and 770 Radio K (KUOM), an AM radio station that is probably the oldest in the state.

===Crookston===
The University of Minnesota Crookston (UMC) joined the university system in 1966. At that time it was known as the University of Minnesota Technical Institute at Crookston. Since 1993 the Crookston campus has offered bachelor&#x27;s degrees, and it has grown to be a more comprehensive regional college campus. It is known for its focus on experiential learning and technology, and through fees each student is provided a laptop computer as part of their experience. The campus mascot is Regal the Eagle, and the athletics teams are known as the Golden Eagles.

===Duluth===
The University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD) became part of the system in 1947, though the campus has a history stretching back to 1895 when it was formed as the Normal School at Duluth. 

Its men&#x27;s hockey program competes in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference and its women&#x27;s hockey program competes in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association. UMD baseball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field, soccer, softball, tennis, and volleyball are Division II teams. Their teams are nicknamed Bulldogs. and their mascot is Champ.

Among the graduates from UMD are former Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota Yvonne Prettner Solon, former Duluth mayor Emily Larson, and former Duluth mayor Don Ness. Brian Kobilka received the 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. UMD has produced numerous professional hockey players including John Harrington and Mark Pavelich from the 1980 Miracle on Ice Olympic hockey team, and NHL Hall of Famer Brett Hull.

Campus media includes &quot;The Bark&quot; newspaper; until 2021, UMD also owned radio station KUMD-FM (now WDSE-FM).

===Morris===
The University of Minnesota Morris (UMM) joined the system in 1960. UMN Morris is a public liberal arts college.

The campus offers 34 majors, 35 minors, and 13 licensure areas, along with the option to create one&#x27;s own major. The student-to-faculty ratio is 13:1, and students are able to engage in undergraduate research and internships with faculty members. One in five students also participates in NCAA Division III Intercollegiate Athletics as a Cougar athlete.

With tuition a quarter of Minnesota&#x27;s most expensive private school and 96% of incoming students receiving financial aid, UMN Morris students graduate with the lowest student loan debt in the University of Minnesota system.

===Rochester===
The University of Minnesota Rochester (UMR) is the public undergraduate health sciences university. UMR is the newest campus of the University of Minnesota system, having been formally established in December 2006 (although the University of Minnesota has offered classes in Rochester as a satellite site since as early as 1966).

UMR has no NCAA athletic teams, but it does have a mascot, the Rochester Raptor.

UMR, located in University Square in downtown Rochester, is neighbor to world-renowned Mayo Clinic. 

Programs offered:

* B.S. in Health Professions (BSHP) is an educational collaboration with Mayo Clinic School of Health Sciences offering tracks in Echocardiography, Respiratory Care, Radiography and Sonography

* B.S. in Health Sciences (BSHS) prepares students for health care careers, graduate education and professional degrees. The Nursing Guarantee program and 3+2 Physician Assistant Master&#x27;s Degree program fall under this degree.

* Masters and Ph.D. in Biomedical Informatics and Computational Biology

* Partnership programs offered: Masters of Business Administration, Bachelor of Nursing, and Masters of Occupational Therapy.

===Waseca===
The Waseca campus opened in 1971 and closed in 1992. Their mascot was &quot;Ramus&quot; the ram. During its operation, it maintained a college cable-FM radio station with the call letters KUMW. Campus buildings became part of a low-security federal prison for women (see Federal Correctional Institution, Waseca). The University still operates an agricultural outreach program in the city.

==History==

The University of Minnesota was founded in Minneapolis in 1851 as a college preparatory school, seven years prior to Minnesota&#x27;s statehood. As such, the University of Minnesota enjoys much autonomy from other operations of the state government. The school was closed during the American Civil War, but reopened in 1867. Minneapolis businessman John Sargent Pillsbury is known today as the &quot;Father of the University&quot;, and aided the campus through financial troubles as a regent, state senator, and governor. The Morrill Land Grant Colleges Act also helped provide funding for the University of Minnesota.
In 1869 the school reorganized and became an institution of higher education. William Watts Folwell served as the University of Minnesota&#x27;s first president. An official residence known as Eastcliff has been used by six university presidents since 1958. The 20-room house, originally built by lumber baron Edward Brooks, Sr., was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

During the traditional autumn through spring year, classes are not held on Thanksgiving Day or the Friday after, and the school traditionally has an extended break covering Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Day. Classes don&#x27;t resume in January until the day after Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. A week-long spring break occurs after the eighth week of the spring term, which sometimes coincides with Easter.

==Sources of funding==
As of 2007, the University of Minnesota maintained an endowment of $2.8 billion. Also, as a public university, the system received an estimated $641 million from the State of Minnesota. The system&#x27;s total budget for FY 2006 was $2.36 billion.

==Additional properties==
There are several other research and outreach centers across the state operated by the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities or by the university system. As of September 2004, these areas plus the campuses are spread across 28,300 acres (44 miles² or 115 km2). Other areas owned by the state and university bring this up to a total of 57,200  acres (89 miles² or 231 km2)

<doc id="49105" wikidata="Q101674" url="?curid=49105" title="Vacuum cleaner">
<text>A vacuum cleaner, also known simply as a vacuum, is a device that uses suction, and often agitation, in order to remove dirt and other debris from carpets, hard floors, and other surfaces.

The dirt is collected into a dust bag or a plastic bin. Vacuum cleaners, which are used in homes as well as in commercial settings, exist in a variety of sizes and types, including stick vacuums, handheld vacuums, upright vacuums, and canister vacuums. Specialized shop vacuums can be used to clean both solid debris and liquids.

== Name ==
Although &quot;vacuum cleaner&quot; and the short form &quot;vacuum&quot; are neutral names, in some countries (UK, Ireland) &quot; hoover&quot; is used instead as a genericized trademark, and as a verb. The name comes from the Hoover Company, one of the first and most influential companies in the development of the device. In New Zealand, particularly the Southland region, it is sometimes called a &quot;lux&quot;, likewise a genericized trademark and used as a verb. The device is also sometimes called a &quot;sweeper&quot; although the same term also refers to a carpet sweeper, a similar invention.

==History==

The vacuum cleaner evolved from the carpet sweeper via manual vacuum cleaners. The first manual models, using bellows, were developed in the 1860s, and the first motorized designs appeared at the turn of the 20th century, with the first decade being the boom decade.

===Manual vacuums===
In 1860 a manual vacuum cleaner was invented by Daniel Hess of West Union, Iowa. Called a &quot;carpet sweeper&quot;, it gathered dust with a rotating brush and had a bellows for generating suction.
Another early model (1869) was the &quot;Whirlwind&quot;, invented in Chicago in 1868 by Ives W. McGaffey. The bulky device worked with a belt driven fan cranked by hand that made it awkward to operate, although it was commercially marketed with mixed success.

A similar model was constructed by Melville R. Bissell of Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1876, who also manufactured carpet sweepers. The company later added portable vacuum cleaners to its line of cleaning tools.

===Powered vacuum cleaners===

The end of the 19th century saw the introduction of powered cleaners, although early types used some variation of blowing air to clean instead of suction. One appeared in 1898 when John S. Thurman of St. Louis, Missouri, submitted a patent (U.S. No. 634,042) for a &quot;pneumatic carpet renovator&quot; which blew dust into a receptacle. Thurman&#x27;s system, powered by an internal combustion engine, traveled to the customer&#x27;s residence on a horse-drawn wagon as part of a door-to-door cleaning service. Corrine Dufour of Savannah, Georgia, received two patents in 1899 and 1900 for another blown-air system that seems to have featured the first use of an electric motor.

In 1901 powered vacuum cleaners using suction were invented independently by British engineer Hubert Cecil Booth and American inventor David T. Kenney. Booth also may have coined the word &quot;vacuum cleaner&quot;. Booth&#x27;s horse-drawn combustion-engine-powered &quot;Puffing Billy&quot;, maybe derived from Thurman&#x27;s blown-air design, relied upon just suction with air pumped through a cloth filter and was offered as part of his cleaning services. Kenney&#x27;s was a stationary steam-engine-powered system with pipes and hoses reaching into all parts of the building.

===Domestic vacuum cleaner===

The first vacuum-cleaning device to be portable and marketed at the domestic market was built in 1905 by Walter Griffiths, a manufacturer in Birmingham, England. His &quot;Griffith&#x27;s Improved Vacuum Apparatus for Removing Dust from Carpets&quot; resembled modern-day cleaners; it was portable, easy to store, and powered by &quot;any one person (such as the ordinary domestic servant)&quot;, who would have the task of compressing a bellows-like contraption to suck up dust through a removable, flexible pipe, to which a variety of shaped nozzles could be attached.
In 1906 James B. Kirby developed his first of many vacuums called the &quot;Domestic Cyclone&quot;. It used water for dirt separation. Later revisions came to be known as the Kirby Vacuum Cleaner. The Cleveland, Ohio factory was built in 1916 and remains open currently, and all Kirby vacuum cleaners are manufactured in the United States.

In 1907 department store janitor James Murray Spangler (1848–1915) of Canton, Ohio, invented the first portable electric vacuum cleaner, obtaining a patent for the Electric Suction Sweeper on 2 June 1908. Crucially, in addition to suction from an electric fan that blew the dirt and dust into a soap box and one of his wife&#x27;s pillow cases, Spangler&#x27;s design utilized a rotating brush to loosen debris. Unable to produce the design himself due to lack of funding, he sold the patent in 1908 to local leather goods manufacturer William Henry Hoover (1849–1932), who had Spangler&#x27;s machine redesigned with a steel casing, casters, and attachments, founding the company that in 1922 was renamed the Hoover Company. Their first vacuum was the 1908 Model O, which sold for $60 ($ in dollars). Subsequent innovations included the beater bar in 1919 (&quot;It beats as it sweeps as it cleans&quot;), disposal filter bags in the 1920s, and an upright vacuum cleaner in 1926.

In Continental Europe, the Fisker and Nielsen company in Denmark was the first to sell vacuum cleaners in 1910. The design weighed just and could be operated by a single person. The Swedish company Electrolux launched their Model V in 1921 with the innovation of being able to lie on the floor on two thin metal runners. In the 1930s the German company Vorwerk started marketing vacuum cleaners of their own design which they sold through direct sales.

===Post-Second World War===

For many years after their introduction, vacuum cleaners remained a luxury item, but after the Second World War, they became common among the middle classes. Vacuums tend to be more common in Western countries, because in most other parts of the world, wall-to-wall carpeting is uncommon and homes have tile or hardwood floors, which are easily swept, wiped or mopped manually without power assist.

The last decades of the 20th century saw the more widespread use of technologies developed earlier, including filterless cyclonic dirt separation, central vacuum systems and rechargeable hand-held vacuums. In addition, miniaturized computer technology and improved batteries allowed the development of a new type of machine—the autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner. In 1997 Electrolux of Sweden demonstrated the Electrolux Trilobite, the first autonomous cordless robotic vacuum cleaner on the BBC-TV program &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;, introducing it to the consumer market in 2001.

===Recent developments===
*In 2004 a British company released AiRider, a hovering vacuum cleaner that floats on a cushion of air, similar to a hovercraft, to make it light-weight and easier to maneuver (compared to using wheels).

*A British inventor has developed a new cleaning technology known as Air Recycling Technology, which, instead of using a vacuum, uses an air stream to collect dust from the carpet. This technology was tested by the Market Transformation Programme (MTP) and shown to be more energy-efficient than the vacuum method. Although working prototypes exist, Air Recycling Technology is not currently used in any production cleaner.

==Modern configurations==
A wide variety of technologies, designs, and configurations are available for both domestic and commercial cleaning jobs.

===Upright===

Upright vacuum cleaners were not only popular in the US, UK, and numerous Commonwealth countries, but also in some Continental European countries like Germany (where the ″Kobold″ was introduced by Vorwerk). They take the form of a cleaning head, onto which a handle and bag are attached. Upright designs generally employ a rotating brushroll or beater bar, which removes dirt through a combination of sweeping and vibration. There are two types of upright vacuums; dirty-air/direct fan (found mostly on commercial vacuums), or clean-air/fan-bypass (found on most of today&#x27;s domestic vacuums).

The older of the two designs, direct-fan cleaners have a large impeller (fan) mounted close to the suction opening, through which the dirt passes directly, before being blown into a bag. The motor is often cooled by a separate cooling fan. Because of their large-bladed fans, and comparatively short airpaths, direct-fan cleaners create a very efficient airflow from a low amount of power, and make effective carpet cleaners. Their &quot;above-floor&quot; cleaning power is less efficient, since the airflow is lost when it passes through a long hose, and the fan has been optimized for airflow volume and not suction.

Fan-bypass uprights have their motor mounted after the filter bag. Dust is removed from the airstream by the bag, and usually a filter, before it passes through the fan. The fans are smaller, and are usually a combination of several moving and stationary turbines working in sequence to boost power. The motor is cooled by the airstream passing through it. Fan-bypass vacuums are good for both carpet and above-floor cleaning, since their suction does not significantly diminish over the distance of a hose, as it does in direct-fan cleaners. However, their air-paths are much less efficient, and can require more than twice as much power as direct-fan cleaners to achieve the same results.

The most common upright vacuum cleaners use a drive-belt powered by the suction motor to rotate the brush-roll. However, a more common design of dual motor upright is available. In these cleaners, the suction is provided via a large motor, while the brushroll is powered by a separate, smaller motor, which does not create any suction. The brush-roll motor can sometimes be switched off, so hard floors can be cleaned without the brush-roll scattering the dirt. It may also have an automatic cut-off feature which shuts the motor off if the brush-roll becomes jammed, protecting it from damage.

===Canister===

Canister models (in the UK also often called cylinder models) dominate the European market. They have the motor and dust collectors (using a bag or bagless) in a separate unit, usually mounted on wheels, which is connected to the vacuum head by a flexible hose. Their main advantage is flexibility, as the user can attach different heads for different tasks, and maneuverability (the head can reach under furniture and makes it very easy to vacuum stairs and vertical surfaces). Many cylinder models have power heads as standard or add-on equipment containing the same sort of mechanical beaters as in upright units, making them as efficient on carpets as upright models. Such beaters are driven by a separate electric motor or a turbine which uses the suction power to spin the brushroll via a drive belt.

===Drum===
Drum or shop vac models are essentially heavy-duty industrial versions of cylinder vacuum cleaners, where the canister consists of a large vertically positioned drum which can be stationary or on wheels. Smaller versions, for use in garages or small workshops, are usually electrically powered. Larger models, which can store over , are often hooked up to compressed air, utilizing the Venturi effect to produce a partial vacuum. Built-in dust collection systems are also used in many workshops.

===Wet/dry===
Wet or wet/dry vacuum cleaners are a specialized form of cylinder/drum models that can be used to clean up wet or liquid spills. They are generally designed to be used both indoors and outdoors and to accommodate both wet and dry debris; some are also equipped with an exhaust port or detachable blower for reversing the airflow, a useful function for everything from clearing a clogged hose to blowing dust into a corner for easy collection.

Shop vacs are able to collect large, bulky or otherwise inconvenient material that would damage or foul household vacuum cleaners, like sawdust, swarf, and liquids.

They use wide hoses, which open directly into the collection chamber (usually a bucket-like cylinder constituting the body of the vacuum). As the airstream enters the larger volume, its flow slows down, allowing the material to drop into the chamber before air is sucked out through the filter and to the vacuum&#x27;s exhaust.

Shop vacs&#x27; performance can be evaluated by a number of metrics. Commonly used ones include the motor&#x27;s rating (using power measurements like watts or horsepower), the vacuum&#x27;s ability to develop suction (using pressure measurements like inches of water), and total airflow through the system (using volume rate measurements like cubic feet per minute).

Related to the wet vacuum is the extraction vacuum cleaner used mainly in hot water extraction, a method of cleaning hard-to-move pieces of fabric like carpets. These machines are able to spray hot soapy water and then suck it back out of the fabric, removing dirt in the process.

Wet vacuum cleaners have been modified by end users, adding an internally-mounted sump pump for continuous removal of liquids without having to stop to empty the tank.

===Pneumatic===
Pneumatic or pneumatic wet/dry vacuum cleaners are a specialized form of wet/dry models that hook up to compressed air. They commonly can accommodate both wet and dry soilage, a useful feature in industrial plants and manufacturing facilities.

===Backpack===
Backpack vacuum cleaners are commonly used for commercial cleaning: they allow the user to move rapidly about a large area. They are essentially small canister vacuums strapped onto the user&#x27;s back.

===Hand-held===

Lightweight hand-held vacuum cleaners, either powered from rechargeable batteries or mains power, are also popular for cleaning up smaller spills. Frequently seen examples include the Black &amp; Decker DustBuster, which was introduced in 1979, and numerous handheld models by Dirt Devil, which were first introduced in 1984. Some battery-powered handheld vacuums are wet/dry rated; the appliance must be partially disassembled and cleaned after picking up wet materials to avoid developing unpleasant odors.

===Robotic===

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, several companies developed robotic vacuum cleaners, a form of carpet sweeper usually equipped with limited suction power. Some prominent brands are Roomba, Neato, and bObsweep. These machines move autonomously while collecting surface dust and debris into a dustbin. They can usually navigate around furniture and come back to a docking station to charge their batteries, and a few are able to empty their dust containers into the dock as well. Most models are equipped with motorized brushes and a vacuum motor to collect dust and debris. While most robotic vacuum cleaners are designed for home use, some models are appropriate for operation in offices, hotels, hospitals, etc.

In December 2009, Neato Robotics launched the world&#x27;s first robotic vacuum cleaner which uses a rotating laser-based range-finder (a form of lidar) to scan and map its surrounding. It uses this map to clean the floor methodically, even if it requires the robot to return to its base multiple times to recharge itself. In many cases it will notice when an area of the floor that was previously inaccessible becomes reachable, such as when a dog wakes up from a nap, and return to vacuum that area.

===Cyclonic===
Portable vacuum cleaners working on the cyclonic separation principle became popular in the 1990s. This dirt separation principle was well known and often used in central vacuum systems. Cleveland&#x27;s P.A. Geier Company had obtained a patent on a cyclonic vacuum cleaner as early as 1928, which was later sold to Health-Mor in 1939, introducing the Filter Queen cyclonic canister vacuum cleaner.

In 1979, James Dyson introduced a portable unit with cyclonic separation, adapting this design from industrial saw mills. He launched his cyclone cleaner first in Japan in the 1980s at a cost of about US$1800 and in 1993 released the Dyson DC01 upright in the UK for £200. Critics expected that people would not buy a vacuum cleaner at twice the price of a conventional unit, but the Dyson design later became the most popular cleaner in the UK.

Cyclonic cleaners do not use filtration bags. Instead, the dust is separated in a detachable cylindrical collection vessel or bin. Air and dust are sucked at high speed into the collection vessel at a direction tangential to the vessel wall, creating a fast-spinning vortex. The dust particles and other debris move to the outside of the vessel by centrifugal force, where they fall due to gravity.

In fixed-installation central vacuum cleaners, the cleaned air may be exhausted directly outside without need for further filtration. A well-designed cyclonic filtration system loses suction power due to airflow restriction only when the collection vessel is almost full. This is in marked contrast to filter bag systems, which lose suction when pores in the filter become clogged as dirt and dust are collected.

In portable cyclonic models, the cleaned air from the center of the vortex is expelled from the machine after passing through a number of successively finer filters at the top of the container. The first filter is intended to trap particles which could damage the subsequent filters that remove fine dust particles. The filters must regularly be cleaned or replaced to ensure that the machine continues to perform efficiently.

Since Dyson&#x27;s success in raising public awareness of cyclonic separation, several other companies have introduced cyclone models. Competing manufacturers include Hoover, Bissell, Bosch, Eureka, Electrolux and Vax. This high level of competition means the cheapest models are generally no more expensive than a conventional cleaner.

===Central===
Central vacuum cleaners, also known as built-in or ducted, are a type of canister/cylinder model which has the motor and dirt filtration unit located in a central location in a building, and connected by pipes to fixed vacuum inlets installed throughout the building. Only the hose and cleaning head need be carried from room to room, and the hose is commonly 8 m (25 ft) long, allowing a large range of movement without changing vacuum inlets. Plastic or metal piping connects the inlets to the central unit. The vacuum head may be unpowered, or have beaters operated by an electric motor or by an air-driven turbine.

The dirt bag or collection bin in a central vacuum system is usually so large that emptying or changing needs to be done less often, perhaps a few times per year for an ordinary household. The central unit usually stays in stand-by, and is turned on by a switch on the handle of the hose. Alternately, the unit powers up when the hose is plugged into the wall inlet, when the metal hose connector makes contact with two prongs in the wall inlet and control current is transmitted through low voltage wires to the main unit.

A central vacuum typically produces greater suction than common portable vacuum cleaners because a larger fan and more powerful motor can be used when they are not required to be portable. A cyclonic separation system, if used, does not lose suction as the collection container fills up, until the container is nearly full. This is in marked contrast to filter-bag designs, which start losing suction immediately as pores in the filter become clogged by accumulated dirt and dust.

A benefit to allergy sufferers is that unlike a standard vacuum cleaner, which must blow some of the dirt collected back into the room being cleaned (no matter how efficient its filtration), a central vacuum removes all the dirt collected to the central unit. Since this central unit is usually located outside the living area, no dust is recirculated back into the room being cleaned. Also it is possible on most newer models to vent the exhaust entirely outside, even with the unit inside the living quarters.

Another benefit of the central vacuum is, because of the remote location of the motor unit, there is much less noise in the room being cleaned than with a standard vacuum cleaner.

===Constellation===
Introduced in 1954, The Hoover Company&#x27;s &quot;Constellation&quot; was of the cylinder type and lacked wheels. Instead the vacuum cleaner floated on its exhaust, operating as a hovercraft, although that was not true of the earliest models, which had a rotating hose, the intention being that the user would place the unit in the center of the room, and work around the cleaner.

The Constellation was changed and updated over the years until discontinued in 1975. Later Constellations routed all of the exhaust under the vacuum using an airfoil. The updated design was quiet even by modern standards, particularly on carpet, because it muffled the sound. Those models float on carpet or bare floor although, on hard flooring, the exhaust air tends to scatter any fluff or debris around.

Hoover re-released an updated version of the later-model Constellation in the US (model # S3341 in Pearl White and # S3345 in stainless steel). Changes included a HEPA filtration bag, a 12-amp motor, a turbine-powered brush roll, and a redesigned version of the handle. The same model was marketed in the UK under the Maytag brand, called the &quot;Satellite&quot; because of licensing restrictions. It was sold from 2006 to 2009.

===Vehicles===
See vacuum truck for very big vacuum cleaners mounted on vehicles.

===Other===
Some other vacuum cleaners include an electric mop in the same machine: for a dry and a later wet clean.

The iRobot company developed the Scooba, a robotic wet vacuum cleaner that carries its own cleaning solution, applies it and scrubs the floor, and vacuums the dirty water into a collection tank.

==Technology==
A vacuum&#x27;s suction is caused by a difference in air pressure. A fan driven by an electric motor (often a universal motor) reduces the pressure inside the machine. Atmospheric pressure then pushes the air through the carpet and into the nozzle, and so the dust is literally pushed into the bag.

Tests have shown that vacuuming can kill 100% of young fleas and 96% of adult fleas.

===Exhaust filtration===

Vacuums by their nature cause dust to become airborne, by exhausting air that is not completely filtered. This can cause health problems since the operator ends up inhaling respirable dust, which is also redeposited into the area being cleaned. There are several methods manufacturers use to control this problem, some of which may be combined in a single appliance. Typically a filter is positioned so that the incoming air passes through it before it reaches the fan, and then the filtered air passes through the motor for cooling purposes. Some other designs use a completely separate air intake for cooling.

It is nearly impossible for a practical air filter to completely remove all ultrafine particles from a dirt-laden airstream. An ultra-efficient air filter will immediately clog up and become ineffective during everyday use, and practical filters are a compromise between filtering effectiveness and restriction of airflow. One way to sidestep this problem is to exhaust partially filtered air to the outdoors, which is a design feature of some central vacuum systems. Specially engineered portable vacuums may also utilize this design, but are more awkward to set up and use, requiring temporary installation of a separate exhaust hose to an exterior window.

* Bag: The most common method to capture the debris vacuumed up involves a paper or fabric bag that allows air to pass through, but attempts to trap most of the dust and debris. The bag may become clogged with fine dust before it is full. The bag may be disposable, or designed to be cleaned and re-used.
* Bagless: In non-cyclonic bagless models, the role of the bag is taken by a removable container and a reusable filter, equivalent to a reusable fabric bag.
* Cyclonic separation: A vacuum cleaner employing this method is also bagless. It causes intake air to be cycled or spun so fast that most of the dust is forced out of the air and falls into a collection bin. The operation is similar to that of a centrifuge. Centrifugal separators eliminate the problem of a bag becoming clogged with fine dust.
* Water filtration: First seen commercially in the 1920s in the form of the Newcombe Separator (later to become the Rexair Rainbow), a water filtration vacuum cleaner uses a water bath as a filter. It forces the dirt-laden intake air to pass through water before it is exhausted, so that wet dust cannot become airborne. The water trap filtration and low speed may also allow the user to use the machine as a stand-alone air purifier and humidifier unit. The dirty water must be dumped out and the appliance must be cleaned after each use, to avoid growth of bacteria and mold, causing unpleasant odors.
* Ultra fine air filter: Also called HEPA filtered, this method is used as a secondary filter after the air has passed through the rest of the machine. It is meant to remove any remaining dust that could harm the operator. Some vacuum cleaners also use an activated charcoal filter to remove odors.

Ordinary vacuum cleaners should never be used to clean up asbestos fibers, even if fitted with a HEPA filter. Specially-designed machines are required to safely clean up asbestos.

===Attachments===
Most vacuum cleaners are supplied with numerous specialized attachments, such as tools, brushes and extension wands, which allow them to reach otherwise inaccessible places or to be used for cleaning a variety of surfaces. The most common of these tools are:

* Hard floor brush (for non-upright designs)
* Powered floor nozzle (for canister designs)
* Dusting brush
* Crevice tool
* Upholstery nozzle

===Specifications===
The performance of a vacuum cleaner can be measured by several parameters:
* Airflow, in litres per second [l/s] or cubic feet per minute (CFM or ft3/min)
* Air speed, in metres per second [m/s] or miles per hour [mph]
* Suction, vacuum, or water lift, in pascals [Pa] or inches of water

Other specifications of a vacuum cleaner are:
* Weight, in kilograms [kg] or pounds [lb]
* Noise, in decibels dB]
* Power cord length and hose length (as applicable)

==== Suction (Pa) ====
The suction is the maximum pressure difference that the pump can create. For example, a typical domestic model has a suction of about negative 20 kPa. This means that it can lower the pressure inside the hose from normal atmospheric pressure (about 100 kPa) by 20 kPa. The higher the suction rating, the more powerful the cleaner. One inch of water is equivalent to about 249 Pa; hence, the typical suction is of water.

====Input power (W)====
The power consumption of a vacuum cleaner, in watts, is often the only figure stated. Many North American vacuum manufacturers give the current only in amperes (e.g. &quot;6 amps&quot;), and the consumer is left to multiply that by the line voltage of 120 volts to get the approximate power ratings in watts. The rated input power does not indicate the effectiveness of the cleaner, only how much electricity it consumes.

After August 2014, due to EU rules, manufacture of vacuum cleaners with a power consumption greater than 1600 watts were banned within the EU, and from 2017 no vacuum cleaner with a wattage greater than 900 watts was permitted.

====Output power (AW)====

The amount of input power that is converted into airflow at the end of the cleaning hose is sometimes stated, and is measured in &quot;airwatts&quot;: the measurement units are simply watts. The word &quot;air&quot; is used to clarify that this is output power, not input electrical power.

The airwatt is derived from English units. ASTM International defines the airwatt as 0.117354 × F × S, where F is the rate of air flow in ft3/min and S is the pressure in inches of water. This makes one airwatt equal to 0.9983 watts.

====Peak horsepower====
The peak horsepower of a vacuum cleaner is often measured by removal of any cooling fans and calculating power based on the motor&#x27;s power plus the rotational inertial energy stored the motor armature and centrifugal blower. A peak horsepower rating is often an impractical figure and is only valid for a very short period. Continuous power is typically far lower.
==Cultural references==
Vacuum cleaners have become closely associated with housecleaning, and artists have sometimes used them to symbolize the banality and routine of everyday life and culture. Visual artist Jeff Koons exhibited his &quot;The New&quot; series of household vacuums enshrined in museum-quality vitrines, such as &quot;New Shelton Wet/Dry Doubledecker&quot; (1981) at the Museum of Modern Art and &quot;New Hoover Convertibles, Green, Blue; New Hoover Convertibles, Green, Blue; Doubledecker&quot; (1981–1987) at the Whitney Museum of American Art. In 2002, fashion designer Tara Subkoff used topless models wielding upright vacuum cleaners to promote her controversial fashion label &quot;Imitation of Christ&quot;.

In 2018, Paulius Markevičius organized performances of &quot;Dance for the Vacuum-Cleaner and Father&quot; choreographed by Greta Grinevičiūtė, and premiered in Vilnius, Lithuania. In 2019, Sandrina Lindgren choreographed dancers in &quot;Requiem for Vacuum Cleaning&quot; in the Barker Theatre of Turku, Finland, with each performer operating multiple machines simultaneously.

Musician Frank Zappa used vacuum cleaners in many of his different performances and on promotional artwork. Other performers have used a vacuum cleaner hose or wand as a modernized version of the Australian Aboriginal didgeridoo, or used the whine of the motor for techno music.

In 1996, &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; episode #1702 featured vacuum cleaners, including dancing, magic, and a segment showing how a small Dirt Devil canister vacuum was manufactured.

<doc id="49107" wikidata="Q204092" url="?curid=49107" title="Willie Dixon">
<text>William James Dixon (July 1, 1915January 29, 1992) was an American blues musician, vocalist, songwriter, arranger and record producer. He was proficient in playing both the upright bass and the guitar, and sang with a distinctive voice, but he is perhaps best known as one of the most prolific songwriters of his time. Next to Muddy Waters, Dixon is recognized as the most influential person in shaping the post–World War II sound of the Chicago blues.

Dixon&#x27;s songs have been recorded by countless musicians in many genres as well as by various ensembles in which he participated. A short list of his most famous compositions includes &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man&quot;, &quot;I Just Want to Make Love to You&quot;, &quot;Little Red Rooster&quot;, &quot;My Babe&quot;, &quot;Spoonful&quot;, and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Judge a Book by the Cover&quot;. These songs were written during the peak years of Chess Records, from 1950 to 1965, and were performed by Muddy Waters, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Little Walter, and Bo Diddley; they influenced a generation of musicians worldwide.

Dixon was an important link between the blues and rock and roll, working with Little Walter, Chuck Berry, and Bo Diddley in the late 1950s. In the 1960s, his songs were adapted by numerous rock artists. He received a Grammy Award and was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Dixon was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi, on July 1, 1915. He was one of 14 children. His mother, Daisy, often rhymed things she said, a habit her son imitated. At the age of seven, young Dixon became an admirer of a band that featured pianist Little Brother Montgomery. He sang his first song at Springfield Baptist Church at the age of four. Dixon was first introduced to blues when he served time on prison farms in Mississippi as a young teenager. Later in his teens, he learned to sing harmony from a local carpenter, Theo Phelps, who led a gospel quintet, the Union Jubilee Singers, in which Dixon sang bass; the group regularly performed on the Vicksburg radio station WQBC. He began adapting his poems into songs and even sold some to local music groups.

===Adulthood===
Dixon left Mississippi for Chicago in 1936. A man of considerable stature, standing 6 feet 6 inches tall and weighing over 250 pounds, he took up boxing, at which he was successful, winning the Illinois State Golden Gloves Heavyweight Championship (Novice Division) in 1937. Around 1939, he became a professional boxer and worked briefly as Joe Louis&#x27;s sparring partner, but after four fights he left boxing in a dispute with his manager over money.

Dixon met Leonard Caston at a boxing gym, where they would harmonize at times. Dixon performed in several vocal groups in Chicago, but it was Caston that persuaded him to pursue music seriously. Caston built him his first bass, made of a tin-can and one string. Dixon&#x27;s experience singing bass made the instrument familiar. He also learned to play the guitar.

In 1939, Dixon was a founding member of the Five Breezes, with Caston, Joe Bell, Gene Gilmore and Willie Hawthorne. The group blended blues, jazz, and vocal harmonies, in the mode of the Ink Spots. Dixon&#x27;s progress on the upright bass came to an abrupt halt with the advent of World War II, when he refused induction into military service as a conscientious objector and was imprisoned for ten months. He refused to go to war because he would not fight for a nation in which institutionalized racism and racist laws were prevalent. After the war, he formed a group named the Four Jumps of Jive. He then reunited with Caston, forming the Big Three Trio, which went on to record for Columbia Records.

===Pinnacle of career===

Dixon signed with Chess Records as a recording artist, but he began performing less, being more involved with administrative tasks for the label. By 1951, he was a full-time employee at Chess, where he acted as producer, talent scout, session musician and staff songwriter. He was also a producer for the Chess subsidiary Checker Records. His relationship with Chess was sometimes strained, but he stayed with the label from 1948 to the early 1960s. During this time Dixon&#x27;s output and influence were prodigious. From late 1956 to early 1959, he worked in a similar capacity for Cobra Records, for which he produced early singles for Otis Rush, Magic Sam, and Buddy Guy. In 1956, Dixon wrote &quot;Fishin&#x27; in My Pond&quot;, which was recorded by Lee Jackson, and released on Cobra in February 1957. Dixon later recorded for Bluesville Records. From the late 1960s until the mid-1970s, Dixon ran his own record label, Yambo Records, and two subsidiary labels, Supreme and Spoonful. He released his 1971 album, &quot;Peace?&quot;, on Yambo and also singles by McKinley Mitchell, Lucky Peterson and others.

Dixon is considered one of the key figures in the creation of Chicago blues. He worked with Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Otis Rush, Bo Diddley, Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson II, Koko Taylor, Little Milton, Eddie Boyd, Jimmy Witherspoon, Lowell Fulson, Willie Mabon, Memphis Slim, Washboard Sam, Jimmy Rogers, Sam Lay and others.

In December 1964, the Rolling Stones reached number one on the UK Singles Chart with their cover of Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Little Red Rooster&quot;. In the same year, the group also covered &quot;I Just Want To Make Love To You&quot; on their debut album, &quot;The Rolling Stones&quot;.

===Copyright battles===
In his later years, Dixon became a tireless ambassador for the blues and a vocal advocate for its practitioners, founding the Blues Heaven Foundation, which works to preserve the legacy of the blues and to secure copyrights and royalties for blues musicians who were exploited in the past. Speaking with the simple eloquence that was a hallmark of his songs, Dixon claimed, &quot;The blues are the roots and the other musics are the fruits. It&#x27;s better keeping the roots alive, because it means better fruits from now on. The blues are the roots of all American music. As long as American music survives, so will the blues.&quot;

In 1977, unhappy with the small royalties paid by Chess&#x27;s publishing company, Arc Music, Dixon and Muddy Waters sued Arc and later Dixon founded his own publishing company, Hoochie Coochie Music.

In 1987, Dixon reached an out-of-court settlement with the rock band Led Zeppelin after suing for plagiarism in the band&#x27;s use of his music in &quot;Bring It On Home&quot; and lyrics from his composition &quot;You Need Love&quot; (1962) in the band&#x27;s recording of &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot;.

===Death and legacy===
Dixon&#x27;s health increasingly deteriorated during the 1970s and the 1980s, primarily as a result of long-term diabetes. Eventually one of his legs was amputated.

Dixon was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980, in the inaugural session of the Blues Foundation&#x27;s ceremony. In 1989 he received a Grammy Award for his album &quot;Hidden Charms&quot;.

Dixon died of heart failure on January 29, 1992, in Burbank, California, and was buried in Burr Oak Cemetery, in Alsip, Illinois.

After his death, his widow, Marie Dixon, took over the Blues Heaven Foundation and moved the headquarters to Chess Records. Dixon was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the category Early Influences (pre-rock) in 1994. On April 28, 2013, both Dixon and his grandson Alex Dixon were inducted into the Chicago Blues Hall of Fame.

In 2007, Dixon was honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in Vicksburg.

The actor and comedian Cedric the Entertainer portrayed Dixon in &quot;Cadillac Records&quot;, a 2008 film based on the early history of Chess Records.

In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked him as the 12th greatest bass player and mentioned him as the history&#x27;s most influential bluesmen.

==Songs==

Dixon wrote or co-wrote more than 500 songs. Several have become blues standards, including &quot;Help Me&quot;, &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Quit You Baby&quot;, &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Superstitious&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m Ready&quot;, &quot;Little Red Rooster&quot;, &quot;My Babe&quot;, and &quot;Spoonful&quot;. Other Dixon compositions that reached the record charts include &quot;Evil&quot; (Howlin&#x27; Wolf), &quot;I Just Want to Make Love to You&quot; (Muddy Waters), &quot;Pretty Thing&quot; (Bo Diddley), &quot;The Seventh Son&quot; (Willie Mabon), &quot;Wang Dang Doodle&quot; (Koko Taylor), and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Judge a Book by the Cover&quot; (Bo Diddley). In the 1960s, Dixon&#x27;s songs were adapted by numerous rock artists.

<text>Gustav Eriksson Vasa (12 May 1496 – 29 September 1560), also known as Gustav I, was King of Sweden from 1523 until his death in 1560. He was previously self-recognised Protector of the Realm (&quot;Riksföreståndare&quot;) from 1521, during the ongoing Swedish War of Liberation against King Christian II of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Gustav rose to lead the Swedish War of Liberation following the Stockholm Bloodbath, where his father was executed. Gustav&#x27;s election as king on 6 June 1523 (the National Day of Sweden) and his triumphant entry into Stockholm eleven days later marked Sweden&#x27;s final secession from the Kalmar Union.
==Early life==
Gustav Eriksson, a son of Cecilia Månsdotter Eka and Erik Johansson Vasa, was probably born in 1496. The birth most likely took place in Rydboholm Castle, northeast of Stockholm, the manor house of the father, Erik. The newborn got his name, Gustav, from Erik&#x27;s grandfather Gustav Anundsson.

Erik Johansson&#x27;s parents were Johan Kristersson and Birgitta Gustafsdotter of the dynasties Vasa and Sture respectively, both dynasties of high nobility. Birgitta Gustafsdotter was the sister of Sten Sture the Elder, regent of Sweden, and their mother was a half-sister of King Charles VIII of Sweden. Being a relative and ally of uncle Sten Sture, Erik inherited the regent&#x27;s estates in Uppland and Södermanland when the latter died in 1503. Although a member of a family with considerable properties since childhood, Gustav Eriksson would later be the holder of possessions of a much greater dimension.

Both of Gustav&#x27;s parents descended from Gregers, the illegitimate son of Birger Jarl; Gustav&#x27;s father descended from Gregers through his maternal great-grandmother Margareta Karlsdotter, while Gustav&#x27;s mother descended from him through her father Magnus Karlsson Eka. Additionally, Birgitta Gustafsdotter and Sten Sture (and consequently also Gustav) descended from King Sverker II of Sweden through King Sverker&#x27;s granddaughter Benedikte Sunesdotter (who was married to Svantepolk Knutsson, son of Duke of Reval).

==Resistance against Denmark==

===Supporting the Sture party===
Since the end of the 14th century, Sweden had been a part of the Kalmar Union with Denmark and Norway. The Danish dominance in this union occasionally led to uprisings in Sweden. During Gustav&#x27;s childhood, parts of the Swedish nobility tried to make Sweden independent. Gustav and his father Erik supported the party of Sten Sture the Younger, regent of Sweden from 1512, and its struggle against King Christian II of Denmark. Following the battle of Brännkyrka in 1518, where Sten Sture&#x27;s troops beat the Danish forces, it was decided that Sten Sture and King Christian would meet in Österhaninge for negotiations. To guarantee the safety of the king, the Swedish side sent six men as hostages to be kept by the Danes for as long as the negotiations lasted. However, Christian did not show up for the negotiations, violated the deal with the Swedish side and took the hostages aboard ships carrying them to Copenhagen. The six members of the kidnapped hostage were Hemming Gadh, Lars Siggesson (Sparre), Jöran Siggesson (Sparre), Olof Ryning, Bengt Nilsson (Färla) – and Gustav Eriksson. Gustav was held in Kalø Castle where he was treated very well after promising he would not make attempts to escape. A reason for this gentle treatment was King Christian&#x27;s hope to convince the six men to switch sides, and turn against their leader Sten Sture. This strategy was successful regarding all men but Gustav, who stayed loyal to the Sture party.

In 1519, Gustav Eriksson escaped from Kalø. He fled to the Hanseatic city of Lübeck where he arrived on 30 September. How he managed to escape is not certain, but according to a somewhat likely story, he disguised himself as a bullocky. For this, Gustav got the nicknames &quot;King Oxtail&quot; and &quot;Gustav Cow Butt&quot;, something he indeed disliked. When a swordsman drank to His Majesty &quot;Gustav Cow Butt&quot; in Kalmar in 1547, the swordsman was killed.

While staying in Lübeck, Gustav could hear about developments in his native Sweden. While he was there, Christian II mobilised to attack Sweden in an effort to seize power from Sten Sture and his supporters. In 1520, the forces of King Christian were triumphant. Sten Sture died in March, but some strongholds, including the Swedish capital Stockholm, were still able to withstand the Danish forces. Gustav left Lübeck on a ship, and was put ashore south of Kalmar on 31 May.

It seems Gustav stayed largely inactive during his first months back on Swedish soil. According to some sources, Gustav received an invitation to the coronation of Christian. This was to take place in the newly captured Stockholm in November. Even though King Christian had promised amnesty to his enemies within the Sture party, including Gustav Eriksson, the latter chose to decline the invitation. The coronation took place on 4 November and days of festivities in a friendly spirit followed. When the celebration had lasted a few days, the castle was locked and the former enemies of King Christian were imprisoned. Accusations against the old supporters of Sten Sture regarding heresy were brought forward. The following day the sentences were announced. During the Stockholm Bloodbath, close to 100 people were executed on Stortorget, among them Gustav Eriksson&#x27;s father, Erik Johansson, and uncle, Joakim Brahe. Gustav himself was at the time staying at Räfsnäs, close to Gripsholm Castle.
===In Dalarna===
Gustav Eriksson had reasons to fear for his life and left Räfsnäs. He travelled to the province of Dalarna, in what was then northwestern Sweden. What happened there has been described in Peder Svart&#x27;s chronicle, which can be described as a strongly biased heroic tale about Gustav Eriksson. The Dalarna adventures of Gustav that could be described as a part of the national heritage of Sweden, can therefore not be verified in a satisfying way. He is supposed to have tried to gather troops among the peasantry in the province, but with little success initially. Being chased by men loyal to King Christian and failing at creating an army to challenge the king, Gustav Eriksson had no other alternative but to flee to Norway. While he made his way from Mora via Lima to Norway, people that had recently turned down Gustav&#x27;s call for support against the king changed their minds. Representatives of that group caught up with Gustav before he had reached Norway and convinced him to follow them back to Mora. Gustav Eriksson&#x27;s run towards Norway and back has formed the background to the famous cross-country ski race Vasaloppet.

===Swedish War of Liberation===

Gustav Eriksson was appointed &quot;hövitsman&quot;. The rebel force he led grew. In February 1521 it consisted of 400 men, mainly from the area around Lake Siljan. The first significant conflict in the Dissolution of the Kalmar Union took place at Brunnbäck&#x27;s Ferry in April, where a rebel army defeated an army loyal to the king. The sacking of the city of Västerås and with it controlling important copper and silver mines gave Gustav Vasa resources and supporters flocked to him. Other parts of Sweden, for example the Götaland provinces of Småland and Västergötland, also saw rebellions. The leading noblemen of Götaland joined Gustav Eriksson&#x27;s forces and, in Vadstena in August, they declared Gustav regent of Sweden.

The election of Gustav Eriksson as a regent made many Swedish nobles, who had so far stayed loyal to King Christian, switch sides. Some noblemen, still loyal to the king, chose to leave Sweden, while others were killed. As a result, the Swedish Privy Council lost old members who were replaced by supporters of Gustav Eriksson. Most fortified cities and castles were conquered by Gustav&#x27;s rebels, but the strongholds with the best defences, including Stockholm, were still under Danish control. In 1522, after negotiations between Gustav Eriksson&#x27;s people and Lübeck, the Hanseatic city joined the war against Denmark. The winter of 1523 saw the joint forces attack the Danish and Norwegian areas of Scania, Halland, Blekinge and Bohuslän. During this winter, Christian II was overthrown and replaced by Frederick I. The new king openly claimed the Swedish throne and had hopes Lübeck would abandon the Swedish rebels. The German city, preferring an independent Sweden to a strong Kalmar Union dominated by Denmark, took advantage of the situation and put pressure on the rebels. The city wanted privileges on future trade as well as guarantees regarding the loans they had granted the rebels. The Privy Council and Gustav Eriksson knew the support from Lübeck was absolutely crucial. As a response, the council decided to appoint Gustav Eriksson king.

====Election as king====
The ceremonial election of the regent Gustav Eriksson as king of Sweden took place when the leading men of Sweden got together in Strängnäs in June 1523. 
When the councillors of Sweden had chosen Gustav as king, he met with the two visiting councillors of Lübeck. The German representatives supported the appointment without hesitation and declared it an act of God. Gustav stated he had to bow to what was described as the will of God. In a meeting with the Privy Council, Gustav Eriksson announced his decision to accept. In the following ceremony, led by the deacon of Strängnäs, Laurentius Andreae, Gustav swore the royal oath. The next day, bishops and priests joined Gustav in Roggeborgen where Laurentius Andreae raised the holy sacrament above a kneeling Gustav Eriksson. Flanked by the councillors of Lübeck, Gustav Eriksson was brought to Strängnäs Cathedral where the king sat down in the choir with the Swedish privy councillors on one side, and the Lübeck representatives on the other. After the hymn &quot;Te Deum&quot;, Laurentius Andreae proclaimed Gustav Eriksson king of Sweden. He was, however, still not crowned. In 1983, in remembrance of the election of Gustav as Swedish king on 6 June, that date was declared the National Day of Sweden.

====The capture of Stockholm====
Shortly after the events of 1523 in Strängnäs, letters patent were issued to Lübeck and its allied Hanseatic cities, who now were freed from tolls when trading in Sweden. An agreement, designed by Lübeck negotiators, was made with the Danish defenders in Stockholm. On 17 June the rebels could enter the capital city. At Midsummer, a grand entrance of king Gustav was arranged at Söderport, the southern gate of Stockholm. Celebrations followed, including a mass of thanksgiving in Storkyrkan (also known as Stockholm Cathedral) led by Peder Jakobsson. Gustav could now install himself in the Tre Kronor palace.

====The war ends====
Bailiffs, still loyal to Christian II, were still holding castles in Finland, a part of Sweden at the time. During the summer and fall of 1523 they all surrendered. The next year, on 24 August 1524, Gustav arrived in Malmö in order to reach a settlement with King Frederick of Denmark-Norway. The Treaty of Malmö (in Swedish: &quot;Malmö recess&quot;) had both positive and negative sides to it, from King Gustav&#x27;s perspective. The treaty meant that Denmark-Norway acknowledged the independence of Sweden. The hopes Gustav had carried of winning further provinces (Gotland and Blekinge) were however scuttled. The treaty marked the end of the Swedish War of Liberation.

==The Reformation==

After Gustav seized power, the previous Archbishop, Gustav Trolle, who at the time held the post of a sort of chancellor, was exiled from the country. Gustav sent a message to Pope Clement VII requesting the acceptance of a new archbishop selected by Gustav himself: Johannes Magnus.

The Pope sent back his decision demanding that the unlawful expulsion of Archbishop Gustav Trolle be rescinded, and that the archbishop be reinstated. Here Sweden&#x27;s remote geographical location proved to have a marked impact – for the former Archbishop had been allied with Christian, or at least was considered to have been so allied in contemporary Stockholm, and to reinstate him would be close to impossible for Gustav.

The king let the Pope know the impossibility of the request, and the possible results if the Pope persisted, but – for better or worse – the Pope did persist, and refused to accept the king&#x27;s suggestions of archbishops. At the time, incidentally and for different reasons, there were also four other unoccupied bishop&#x27;s seats, where the king made suggestions to the Pope about candidates, but the Pope only accepted one of the candidates. Because the Pope refused to budge on the issue of Gustav Trolle, the king, influenced by Lutheran scholar Olaus Petri, in 1531 took it upon himself to appoint yet another archbishop, namely the brother of Olaus, Laurentius Petri. With this royal act, the Pope lost any influence over the Swedish Church.
In the 1520s, the Petri brothers led a campaign for the introduction of Lutheranism. The decade saw many events which can be seen as gradual introductions of Protestantism, for instance the marriage of Olaus Petri – a consecrated priest – and several texts published by him, advocating Lutheran dogmas. A translation of the New Testament had also been published in 1526. After the reformation, a full translation was published in 1540–41, called the Gustav Vasa Bible. However, knowledge of Greek and Hebrew among Swedish clergymen was not sufficient for a translation from the original sources; instead the work followed the German translation by Martin Luther in 1534.

Gustav Vasa&#x27;s breaking with the Catholic Church is virtually simultaneous with Henry VIII doing the same in England; both kings acted following a similar pattern, i.e., a prolonged confrontation with the Pope culminating with the king deciding to take his own decisions independently of Rome.

==Further reign==

Gustav encountered resistance from some areas of the country. People from Dalarna rebelled three times in the first ten years of Gustav&#x27;s reign, as they considered the king to have been too harsh on everyone he perceived as a supporter of the Danish, and as they resented his introduction of Protestantism. Many of those who had helped Gustav in his war against the Danes became involved in these rebellions and paid for this, several of them with their lives.

Peasants in Småland rebelled in 1542, fuelled by grievances over taxes, church reform and confiscation of church bells and vestments. For several months this uprising caused Gustav severe difficulties in the dense forests. The king sent a letter to the people of the province of Dalarna, requesting that they should circulate letters to every Swedish province, stating their support for the king with their troops, and urging every other province to do the same. Gustav got his troops, with whose help – and, not least, with paid German mercenaries – he managed to defeat the rebels in the spring of 1543.

The leader of the rebels, Nils Dacke, has traditionally been seen as a traitor to Sweden. His own letters and proclamations to fellow peasants focused on the suppression of Roman Catholic customs of piety, the King&#x27;s requisitions of church bells and church plate to be smelted down for money and the general discontent with Gustav&#x27;s autocratic measures, and the King&#x27;s letters indicate that Dacke had considerable military success for several months. Historical records state that Nils was seriously wounded during a battle, taking bullet wounds to both legs; if this is true, his survival may have been surprising in view of contemporary medical techniques. Some sources state that Nils was executed by quartering; others that he was reduced to the state of an outlaw after recovering from his wounds, and killed while trying to escape through the woods on the border between Småland and then Danish Blekinge. It is said that his body parts were displayed throughout Sweden as a warning to other would-be rebels; this is uncertain though his head was likely mounted on a pole at Kalmar. Modern Swedish scholarship has toned down criticism of Nils Dacke, sometimes making him into a hero in the vein of Robin Hood, particularly in Småland.

Difficulties with the continuation of the Church also troubled Gustav Vasa. The 1540s saw him imposing death sentences upon both the Petri brothers, as well as his former chancellor Laurentius Andreae. All of them were however granted amnesty, after spending several months in jail. In 1554–1557, he waged an inconclusive war against Ivan the Terrible of Russia.

===End of reign===

In the late 1550s, Gustav&#x27;s health declined. When his grave was opened in 1945, an examination of his corpse revealed that he had suffered chronic infections of a leg and in his jaw.

Gustav gave a so-called &quot;last speech&quot; in 1560 to the chancellors, his children and other noblemen, whereby he encouraged them to remain united. On 29 September 1560, Gustav died and was buried (together with three of his wives, while only two are engraved) in the Cathedral of Uppsala.

==Gustav as king==
Gustav proved an energetic administrator with a ruthless streak not inferior to his predecessor&#x27;s, brutally suppressing subsequent uprisings (three in Dalarna – which had once been the first region to support his claim to the throne – one in Västergötland, and one in Småland). He worked to raise taxes and bring about a Reformation in Sweden, replacing the prerogatives of local landowners, noblemen and clergy with centrally appointed governors and bishops. His 37-year rule, which was the longest of an adult Swedish king to that date (subsequently passed by Gustav V and Carl XVI Gustav) saw a complete break with not only the Danish – Norwegian supremacy but also the Roman Catholic Church, whose assets were nationalised, with the Lutheran Church of Sweden established under his personal control. He became the first truly autocratic native Swedish sovereign and was a skilled bureaucrat and propagandist, with tales of his largely fictitious adventures during the liberation struggle still widespread to this day. In 1544, he abolished Medieval Sweden&#x27;s elective monarchy and replaced it with a hereditary monarchy under the House of Vasa, which held the Swedish throne until 1654. Three of his sons, Erik XIV, John III and Charles IX, held the kingship at different points.

Gustav Vasa has subsequently been labelled the founder of modern Sweden, and the &quot;father of the nation&quot;. Gustav liked to compare himself to Moses, whom he believed to have also liberated his people and established a sovereign state. As a person, Gustav was known for ruthless methods and a bad temper, but also a fondness for music and had a certain sly wit and ability to outmaneuver and annihilate his opponents. He founded one of the oldest orchestras of the world, &quot;Kungliga Hovkapellet&quot; (Royal Court Orchestra); thus Royal housekeeping accounts from 1526 mention twelve musicians including wind players and a timpanist but no string players. Today, &quot;Kungliga Hovkapellet&quot; is the orchestra of the Royal Swedish Opera.

==Legacy==

In Sweden, Gustav Vasa is considered to rank among the country&#x27;s greatest kings, arguably even the most significant ruler in Swedish history. Having ended foreign domination over Sweden, centralised and reorganised the government, cut religious ties to Rome, established the Swedish Church, and founded Sweden&#x27;s hereditary monarchy, Gustav Vasa holds a place of great prominence in Swedish history and is a central character in Swedish nationalist narratives. He is often described as a founding father of the modern Swedish state, if not of the nation as such. Historians have nonetheless noted the often brutal methods with which he ruled, and his legacy, though clearly of great and lasting importance, is not necessarily viewed in exclusively positive terms.

Many details of Gustav Vasa&#x27;s historical record are disputed. In 19th-century Swedish history a folklore developed wherein Gustav was supposed to have had many adventures when he liberated Sweden from the Danes. Today most of these stories are considered to have no other foundation than legend and skilful propaganda by Gustav himself during his time. One such story states he was staying at a close friend&#x27;s farm to rest for one day during his escape from the Danish army. As he was warming himself in the common room, the Danish soldiers got a tip from one of the farm hands that Gustav was in his landlord&#x27;s farm house. The Danish soldiers burst into the farm house and began searching in the common room for someone that would fit Gustav&#x27;s description. As one of the soldiers came close to check Gustav Vasa, all of a sudden the landlady took out a bakery spade and started to hit Gustav and and ordered him to go out and work. The Danish soldier found it amusing and did not realise this &quot;lazy farm boy&quot; was in fact Gustav Vasa himself who managed to slip away from danger and escape death. There are many other stories about Gustav&#x27;s close encounters with death, however it is questionable if any of his adventures really did happen or were dramatised by Gustav himself; regardless of whether they happened or not, his adventures are still told to this day in Sweden.

Gustav&#x27;s memory has been honoured greatly, resulting in embroidered history books, commemorative coins, and the annual ski event Vasaloppet (the largest ski event in the world with 15,000 participants). The city of Vaasa in Finland was named after the royal house of Vasa in 1606. 18th century playwrights and librettists used his biography as the source for some of their works, including the 1739 &quot;Gustavus Vasa&quot; by Henry Brooke (the first play banned under the Licensing Act 1737, due to Robert Walpole&#x27;s belief that the play&#x27;s villain was a proxy for himself) and the 1770 &quot;Gustavo primo re di Svezia&quot;. The name &quot;Gustavus Vasa&quot; was also given to Olaudah Equiano, a prominent Black British abolitionist.

Gustav used to be portrayed on the 1,000 kronor note, until he was replaced by Dag Hammarskjöld in June 2016. Gustav has been regarded by some as a power-hungry man who wished to control everything: the Church, the economy, the army and all foreign affairs. But in doing this, he also did manage to unite Sweden, a country that previously had no standardised language, and where individual provinces held a strong regional power. He also laid the foundation for Sweden&#x27;s professional army that was to make Sweden into a regional superpower in the 17th century.

==Gallery==
Gustav Vasa had a series of allegorical paintings made during his reign. The originals are lost but watercolor reproductions from the 18th century date remain. Several interpretations have been put forth, including that they show him abolishing the Catholic church, but the main view is that they depict him freeing Sweden from Christian II&#x27;s control.
==Family==

Gustav&#x27;s first wife was Catherine of Saxe-Lauenburg (1513–1535), whom he married on 24 September 1531. They had a son:

<text>Potsdam () is the capital and largest city of the German state of Brandenburg. It is part of the Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region. Potsdam sits on the River Havel, a tributary of the Elbe, downstream of Berlin, and lies embedded in a hilly morainic landscape dotted with many lakes, around 20 of which are located within Potsdam&#x27;s city limits. It lies some southwest of Berlin&#x27;s city centre. The name of the city and of many of its boroughs are of Slavic origin.

Potsdam was a residence of the Prussian kings and the German Emperor until 1918. Its planning embodied ideas of the Age of Enlightenment: through a careful balance of architecture and landscape, Potsdam was intended as &quot;a picturesque, pastoral dream&quot; which would remind its residents of their relationship with nature and reason.

The city, which is over 1,000 years old, is widely known for its palaces, its lakes, and its overall historical and cultural significance. Landmarks include the parks and palaces of Sanssouci, Germany&#x27;s largest World Heritage Site, as well as other palaces such as the Orangery Palace, the New Palace, Cecilienhof Palace, and Charlottenhof Palace. Potsdam was also the location of the significant Potsdam Conference in 1945, the conference where the three heads of government of the USSR, the US, and the UK decided on the division of Germany following its surrender, a conference which defined Germany&#x27;s history for the following 45 years.

Babelsberg, in the south-eastern part of Potsdam, was already by the 1930s the home of a major film production studio and it has enjoyed success as an important center of European film production since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Filmstudio Babelsberg, founded in 1912, is the oldest large-scale film studio in the world.

Potsdam developed into a centre of science in Germany in the 19th century. Today, there are three public colleges, the University of Potsdam, and more than 30 research institutes in the city.

== Geography ==

The area was formed from a series of large moraines left after the last glacial period. Today, only one quarter of the city is built up, the rest remaining as green space.

There are about 20 lakes and rivers in and around Potsdam, such as the Havel, the Griebnitzsee, Templiner See, Tiefer See, Jungfernsee, Teltowkanal, Heiliger See, and Sacrower See. The highest point is the &quot;Kleiner Ravensberg&quot;.

===Subdivisions===
Potsdam is divided into seven historic city &quot;Stadtteile&quot; (quarters) and nine new &quot;Ortsteile&quot; (suburbs/wards, former separate villages), which joined the city in 2003. The appearance of the city boroughs is quite different. Those in the north and in the centre consist mainly of historical buildings, the south of the city is dominated by larger areas of newer buildings.

The city of Potsdam is divided into 32 &quot;Stadtteile&quot; (boroughs, both quarters and suburbs/wards together), which are divided further into 84 statistical &quot;Bezirke&quot; (districts).

Today, one distinguishes between the older parts of the city (areas of the historic city and places suburbanized at the latest in 1939) – these are the city center, the western and northern suburbs, Bornim, Bornstedt, Nedlitz, Potsdam South, Babelsberg, Drewitz, Stern and Kirchsteigfeld – and those communities incorporated after 1990 which have since 2003 become &quot;Ortsteile&quot; – these are Eiche, Fahrland, Golm, Groß Glienicke, Grube, Marquardt, Neu Fahrland, Satzkorn and Uetz-Paaren. The new &quot;Ortsteile&quot; are located mainly in the north of the city. For the history of all incorporations, see the relevant section on incorporation and spin-offs.

&quot;Structure with statistical numbering:&quot;
* 1 Potsdam Nord
** 11 Bornim
** 12 Nedlitz
** 13 Bornstedt
** 14 Sacrow
** 15 Eiche
** 16 Grube

** 86 Groß Glienicke
At the end of 2019, a change was made to the administrative structure:
* Borough 41 has been renamed: previously &quot;Nördliche Innenstadt&quot;, now &quot;Historische Innenstadt&quot;.
* Borough 42 &quot;(Südliche Innenstadt)&quot; has been divided into two boroughs, 43 &quot;(Zentrum Ost und Nuthepark)&quot; and 44 &quot;(Hauptbahnhof und Brauhausberg Nord)&quot;. The number 42 was thus repealed.
* Some very sparsely populated urban boroughs have been disbanded:
** Borough 33 &quot;(Wildpark)&quot; was incorporated into borough 32 &quot;(Potsdam-West)&quot;.
** Borough 66 &quot;(Industriegelände)&quot; was incorporated into borough 64 (formerly &quot;Waldstadt I&quot;). The borough was then renamed &quot;Waldstadt I und Industriegelände&quot;.
** Borough 67 &quot;(Forst Potsdam Süd)&quot; was incorporated into borough 61 &quot;(Templiner Vorstadt)&quot;.

=== Climate ===
Officially the climate is oceanic - more degraded by being far from the coast and to the east (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), but using the 1961–1990 normal and the 0 °C isotherm the city has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;), which also shows a slight influence of the continent different from the climates predominantly influenced by the Atlantic Ocean. Low averages below freezing for almost all winter causing snows that are frequent and winters are cold, but not as stringent as inland locations or with greater influence from the same. Summer is also relatively warm with temperatures between 23 and 24 °C, the heat waves being influenced by the UHI of Potsdam.

The average winter high temperature is , with a low of . Snow is common in the winter. Spring and autumn are short. Summers are mild, with a high of and a low of .

The Potsdam weather station has recorded the following extreme values:
* Its highest temperature was on 20 July 2022.
* Its lowest temperature was on 11 February 1929.
* Its greatest annual precipitation was in 2007.
* Its least annual precipitation was in 2018.
* The longest annual sunshine was 2,246.7 hours in 2018.
* The shortest annual sunshine was 1,355.3 hours in 1903.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Potsdam&quot; originally seems to have been &quot;Poztupimi&quot;. A common theory is that it derives from an old West Slavonic term meaning &quot;beneath the oaks&quot;, i.e., the corrupted &quot;pod dubmi/dubimi&quot; (&quot;pod&quot; &quot;beneath&quot;, &quot;dub&quot; &quot;oak&quot;). However, some question this explanation.

==History==
===Pre- and early history===


The area around Potsdam shows signs of occupancy since the Bronze Age and was part of &quot;Magna Germania&quot; as described by Tacitus. After the great migrations of the Germanic peoples, Slavs moved in and Potsdam was probably founded after the 7th century as a settlement of the Hevelli tribe centred on a castle. It was first mentioned in a document in 993 as &quot;Poztupimi&quot;, when Emperor Otto III gifted the territory to the Quedlinburg Abbey, then led by his aunt Matilda. By 1317, it was mentioned as a small town. It gained its town charter in 1345. In 1573, it was still a small market town of 2,000 inhabitants.

===Early modern era===
Potsdam lost nearly half of its population due to the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648).

A continuous Hohenzollern possession since 1415, Potsdam became prominent, when it was chosen in 1660 as the hunting residence of Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg, the core of the powerful state that later became the Kingdom of Prussia. It also housed Prussian barracks.
After the Edict of Potsdam in 1685, Potsdam became a centre of European immigration. Its religious freedom attracted people from France (Huguenots), Russia, the Netherlands and Bohemia. The edict accelerated population growth and economic recovery.

Later, the city became a full residence of the Prussian royal family. The buildings of the royal residences were built mainly during the reign of Frederick the Great. One of these is the Sanssouci Palace (French: &quot;without cares&quot; or &quot;no concern&quot;, by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, 1744), famed for its formal gardens and Rococo interiors. Other royal residences include the New Palace and the Orangery.

In 1815, at the formation of the Province of Brandenburg, Potsdam became the provincial capital until 1918, except for a period between 1827 and 1843 when Berlin was the provincial capital (as it became once again after 1918). The province comprised two governorates named after their capitals Potsdam and Frankfurt (Oder).

===Governorate of Potsdam===
Between 1815 and 1945, the city of Potsdam served as capital of the (). The &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; encompassed the former districts of Uckermark, the Mark of Priegnitz, and the greater part of the Middle March. It was situated between Mecklenburg and the Province of Pomerania on the north, and the Province of Saxony on the south and west (Berlin, with a small surrounding district, was an urban governorate and enclave within the governorate of Potsdam between 1815 and 1822, then it merged as urban district into the governorate only to be disentangled again from Potsdam governorate in 1875, becoming a distinct province-like entity on 1 April 1881). Towards the north west the governorate was bounded by the rivers Elbe and the Havel, and on the north east by the Oder. The south eastern boundary was to the neighbouring governorate of Frankfurt (Oder). About 500,000 inhabitants lived in the Potsdam governorate, which covered an area of about , divided into thirteen rural districts, partially named after their capitals:

The traditional towns in the governorate were small, however, in the course of the industrial labour migration some reached the rank of urban districts. The principal towns were Brandenburg upon Havel, Köpenick, Potsdam, Prenzlau, Spandau and Ruppin. Until 1875 Berlin also was a town within the governorate. After its disentanglement a number of its suburbs outside Berlin&#x27;s municipal borders grew to towns, many forming urban &quot;Bezirke&quot; within the governorate of Potsdam such as Charlottenburg, Lichtenberg, Rixdorf (after 1912 Neukölln), and Schöneberg (all of which, as well as Köpenick and Spandau, incorporated into Greater Berlin in 1920). The urban &quot;Bezirke&quot; were (years indicating the elevation to rank of urban &quot;Bezirk&quot; or affiliation with Potsdam governorate, respectively):

===20th century===
Berlin was the capital of Prussia and later of the German Empire, but the court remained in Potsdam, where many government officials settled. In 1914, Emperor Wilhelm II signed the Declaration of War in the &quot;Neues Palais&quot; (New Palace). The city lost its status as a &quot;second capital&quot; in 1918, when Wilhelm II abdicated and Germany became a Republic at the end of World War I.

After the Nazis seized power in 1933, there was a ceremonial handshake between President Paul von Hindenburg and the new Chancellor Adolf Hitler on 21 March 1933 in Potsdam&#x27;s Garrison Church in what became known as the &quot;Day of Potsdam&quot;. This symbolised a coalition of the military (&quot;Reichswehr&quot;) and Nazism. Potsdam was severely damaged by Allied bombing raids during World War II.

The Cecilienhof Palace was the scene of the Potsdam Conference from 17 July to 2 August 1945, at which the victorious Allied leaders Harry S. Truman, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin met to decide the future of Germany and postwar Europe in general. The conference ended with the Potsdam Agreement and the Potsdam Declaration.
The government of East Germany (formally known as the German Democratic Republic (German: &quot;Deutsche Demokratische Republik&quot;, DDR)) tried to remove symbols of &quot;Prussian militarism&quot;. Many historic buildings, some of them badly damaged in the war, were demolished.

When in 1946 the remainder of the province of Brandenburg west of the Oder-Neiße line was constituted as the state of Brandenburg, Potsdam became its capital. In 1952 the GDR disestablished its states and replaced them by smaller new East German administrative districts known as &quot;Bezirke&quot;. Potsdam became the capital of the new &quot;Bezirk Potsdam&quot; until 1990.

Potsdam, south-west of Berlin, lay just outside West Berlin after the construction of the Berlin Wall. The walling off of West Berlin not only isolated Potsdam from West Berlin, but also doubled commuting times to East Berlin. The Glienicke Bridge across the Havel connected the city to West Berlin and was the scene of some Cold War exchanges of spies.

After German reunification, Potsdam became the capital of the newly re-established state of Brandenburg. Since then there have been many ideas and efforts to reconstruct the original appearance of the city, including the Potsdam City Palace and the Garrison Church.

==Demography==

Since 2000 Potsdam has been one of the fastest-growing cities in Germany.

===City government===
Potsdam has had a mayor (&quot;Bürgermeister&quot;) and city council since the 15th century. From 1809 the city council was elected, with a mayor (&quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot;) at its head. During Nazi Germany, the mayor was selected by the NSDAP and the city council was dissolved; it was reconstituted in token form after 1945, but free elections did not take place until after reunification.

Today, the city council is the city&#x27;s central administrative authority. Local elections took place on 26 October 2003 and again in 2008. Between 1990 and 1999, the Chairman of the City Council was known as the &quot;Town President&quot; but today the post is the &quot;Chairman of the City Council&quot;. The mayor is elected directly by the population.
The current mayor is Mike Schubert of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) since 2018. The most recent mayoral election was held on 23 September 2018, with a runoff held on 14 October, and the results were as follows:

==Education and research==
Potsdam is a university town. The University of Potsdam was founded in 1991 as a university of the State of Brandenburg. Its predecessor was the &quot;Akademie für Staats- und Rechtswissenschaften der DDR &quot;Walter Ulbricht&quot;&quot;, a college of education founded in 1948 which was one of the GDR&#x27;s most important colleges. There are about 20,000 students enrolled at the university.
In 1991 the &quot;Fachhochschule Potsdam&quot; was founded as the second college. It had 3,518 students as of 2017.

As well as universities, Potsdam is home to reputable secondary schools. Montessori Gesamtschule Potsdam, in western Potsdam, attracts 400 students from the Brandenburg and Berlin region.

==Culture==

Potsdam was historically a centre of European immigration. Its religious tolerance attracted people from France, Russia, the Netherlands and Bohemia. This is still visible in the culture and architecture of the city.

The most popular attraction in Potsdam is Sanssouci Park, west of the city centre. In 1744 King Frederick the Great ordered the construction of a residence here, where he could live &quot;sans souci&quot; (&quot;without worries&quot;, in the French spoken at the court). The park hosts a botanical garden (Botanical Garden, Potsdam) and many buildings:

* The Sanssouci Palace (&quot;Schloss Sanssouci&quot;), a relatively modest palace of the Prussian royal (and later German imperial) family
* The Orangery Palace (&quot;Orangerieschloss&quot;), former palace for foreign royal guests
* The New Palace (&quot;Neues Palais&quot;), built between 1763 and 1769 to celebrate the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War, in which Prussia held off the combined attacks of Austria and Russia. It is a much larger and grander palace than Sanssouci, having over 200 rooms and 400 statues as decoration. It served as a guest house for numerous royal visitors. Today, it houses parts of University of Potsdam.
* The Charlottenhof Palace (&quot;Schloss Charlottenhof&quot;), a Neoclassical palace by Karl Friedrich Schinkel built in 1826
* The Roman Baths (&quot;Römische Bäder&quot;), built by Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Friedrich Ludwig Persius in 1829–1840. It is a complex of buildings including a tea pavilion, a Renaissance-style villa, and a Roman bathhouse (from which the whole complex takes its name).
* The Chinese Tea House (&quot;Chinesisches Teehaus&quot;), an 18th-century pavilion built in a Chinese style, the fashion of the time.

Three gates from the original city wall remain today. The oldest is the Hunters&#x27; Gate (&quot;Jägertor&quot;), built in 1733. The Nauener Tor was built in 1755 and close to the historic Dutch Quarter. The ornate Brandenburg Gate (built in 1770, not to be confused with the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin) is situated on the Luisenplatz at the western entrance to the old town.

The Old Market Square (&quot;Alter Markt&quot;) is Potsdam&#x27;s historical city centre. For three centuries this was the site of the City Palace (&quot;Stadtschloß&quot;), a royal palace built in 1662. Under Frederick the Great, the palace became the winter residence of the Prussian kings. The palace was severely damaged by Allied bombing in 1945 and demolished in 1961 by the Communist authorities. In 2002 the Fortuna Gate (&quot;Fortunaportal&quot;) was rebuilt in its original historic position which was followed by a complete reconstruction of the palace as the Brandenburg Landtag building inaugurated in 2014. Nearby the square in the Humboldtstraße block, which also was demolished after getting damaged in 1945, reconstructions of several representative residential palaces including Palazzo Pompei and Palazzo Barberini housing an arts museum were completed in 2016–2017 alongside buildings with modernized facades to restore the historical proportions of the block.

The Old Market Square is dominated today by the dome of St. Nicholas&#x27; Church, built in 1837 in the Neoclassical style. It was the last work of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, who designed the building but did not live to see its completion. It was finished by his disciples Friedrich August Stüler and Ludwig Persius. The eastern side of the Market Square is dominated by the Old City Hall, built in 1755 by the Dutch architect Jan Bouman (1706–1776). It has a characteristic circular tower, crowned with a gilded Atlas bearing the world on his shoulders.

North of the Old Market Square is the oval French Church (&quot;Französische Kirche&quot;), erected in the 1750s by Boumann for the Huguenot community. To the south lies the Museum Barberini, a copy of the previous building, the Barberini Palace. The museum was funded by the German billionaire Hasso Plattner. The former Baroque building was built by Carl von Gontard in 1771–1772, inspired by the Renaissance palace Palazzo Barberini in Rome. The newly built museum was scheduled to open in spring 2017.

The Garrison Church contains a Coventry chapel, an exhibition about the history of the place and a viewing platform at a height of 57 meters.

Another landmark of Potsdam is the two-street Dutch Quarter (&quot;Holländisches Viertel&quot;), an ensemble of buildings that is unique in Europe, with about 150 houses built of red bricks in the Dutch style. It was built between 1734 and 1742 under the direction of Jan Bouman to be used by Dutch artisans and craftsmen who had been invited to settle here by King Frederick Wilhelm I. Today, this area is one of Potsdam&#x27;s most visited quarters.

North of the city centre is the Russian colony of Alexandrowka, a small enclave of Russian architecture (including an Orthodox chapel) built in 1825 for a group of Russian immigrants. Since 1999, the colony has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.

East of the Alexandrowka colony is a large park, the New Garden (&quot;Neuer Garten&quot;), which was laid out from 1786 in the English style. The site contains two palaces; one of them, the Cecilienhof, was where the Potsdam Conference was held in July and August 1945. The &quot;Marmorpalais&quot; (Marble Palace) was built in 1789 in Neoclassical style. Nearby is the &quot;Biosphäre Potsdam&quot;, a tropical botanical garden.

Babelsberg, a quarter south-east of the centre, houses the UFA film studios (Babelsberg Studios), and an extensive park with some historical buildings, including the Babelsberg Palace (Schloß Babelsberg, a Gothic revival palace designed by Schinkel).

The Einstein Tower is located within the Albert Einstein Science Park, which is on the top of the &quot;Telegraphenberg&quot; within an astronomy compound.

Potsdam also features a memorial centre in the former KGB prison in Leistikowstraße. In the Volkspark to the north, there is one of the last monuments dedicated to Lenin in Germany.

Potsdam joined UNESCO&#x27;s Network of Creative Cities as a Design City on October 31, 2019, on the occasion of World Cities&#x27; Day.

<text>Rouen (, ; ) is a city on the River Seine, in northwestern France. It is in the prefecture of region of Normandy and the department of Seine-Maritime. Formerly one of the largest and most prosperous cities of medieval Europe, the population of the metropolitan area () is 702,945 (2018). People from Rouen are known as &quot;Rouennais&quot;.

Rouen was the seat of the Exchequer of Normandy during the Middle Ages. It was one of the capitals of the Anglo-Norman and Angevin dynasties, which ruled both England and large parts of modern France from the 11th to the 15th centuries. From the 13th century onwards, the city experienced a remarkable economic boom, thanks in particular to the development of textile factories and river trade. Claimed by both the French and the English during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, it was on its soil that Joan of Arc was tried and burned alive on 30 May 1431. Severely damaged by the wave of bombing in 1944, it nevertheless regained its economic dynamism in the post-war period thanks to its industrial sites and its large seaport, which merged with the ports of Le Havre and Paris in 2021 to form the HAROPA Port.

Endowed with a prestige established during the medieval era, and with a long architectural heritage in its historical monuments, Rouen is an important cultural capital. Several renowned establishments are located here, such as the Museum of Fine Arts, Le Secq des Tournelles museum, and Rouen Cathedral.

Seat of an archdiocese, it also hosts a court of appeal and a university. Every four to six years, Rouen becomes the showcase for a large gathering of sailing ships called &quot;L&#x27;Armada&quot;; this event makes the city an occasional capital of the maritime world.

==History==

Rouen was founded by the Gaulish tribe of the Veliocasses, who controlled a large area in the lower Seine valley. They called it &quot;Ratumacos&quot;; the Romans called it &quot;Rotomagus&quot;. It was considered the second city of Gallia Lugdunensis after Lugdunum (Lyon) itself. Under the reorganization of Diocletian, Rouen was the chief city of the divided province Gallia Lugdunensis II and reached the apogee of its Roman development, with an amphitheatre and &quot;thermae&quot; of which foundations remain. In the 5th century, it became the seat of a bishopric and later a capital of Merovingian Neustria.

From their first incursion into the lower valley of the Seine in 841, the Normans overran Rouen. From 912, Rouen was the capital of the Duchy of Normandy and residence of the local dukes, until William the Conqueror moved his residence to Caen. In 1150, Rouen received its founding charter which permitted self-government.

During the 12th century, Rouen was the site of a yeshiva known as La Maison Sublime. Discovered in 1976, it is now a museum. At that time, about 6,000 Jews lived in the town, comprising about 20% of the population.

On 24 June 1204, King Philip II Augustus of France entered Rouen and definitively annexed Normandy to the French Kingdom. He demolished the Norman castle and replaced it with his own, the Château Bouvreuil, built on the site of the Gallo-Roman amphitheatre. A textile industry developed based on wool imported from England, for which the cities of Flanders and Brabant were constantly competitors, and finding its market in the Champagne fairs. Rouen also depended for its prosperity on the river traffic of the Seine, on which it enjoyed a monopoly that reached as far upstream as Paris.

In the 13th and 14th centuries urban strife threatened the city: in 1291, the mayor was assassinated and noble residences in the city were pillaged. Philip IV reimposed order and suppressed the city&#x27;s charter and the lucrative monopoly on river traffic, but he was quite willing to allow the Rouennais to repurchase their old liberties in 1294. In 1306, he decided to expel the Jewish community of Rouen, then numbering some five or six thousand. In 1389, another urban revolt of the underclass occurred, the &quot;Harelle&quot;. It was suppressed with the withdrawal of Rouen&#x27;s charter and river-traffic privileges once more.

During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, on 19 January 1419, Rouen surrendered after a long siege to Henry V of England, who annexed Normandy once again to the Plantagenet domains. French soldier Alain Blanchard summarily hung English prisoners of war from the city walls during the siege, for which he was beheaded after Rouen fell, while Canon and Vicar General of Rouen Robert de Livet excommunicated Henry V, resulting in him being imprisoned for five years in England. Joan of Arc, who supported a return to French rule, was burned at the stake on 30 May 1431 in Rouen, where most inhabitants supported the duke of Burgundy, the French king&#x27;s enemy. The king of France, Charles VII, recaptured the town in 1449.

Rouen was staunchly Catholic during the French Wars of Religion, and underwent an unsuccessful five-month siege in 1591/2 by the Protestant Henry IV of France and an English force under Earl of Essex. A brief account by an English participant has survived.

The first competitive motor race ran from Paris to Rouen in 1894.

During the German occupation in World War II, the Kriegsmarine had its headquarters located in a chateau on what is now the Rouen Business School. The city was heavily damaged during the same war on D-day, and its famed cathedral was almost destroyed by Allied bombs.

==Main sights==

Rouen is known for Rouen Cathedral, with its &quot;Tour de Beurre&quot; (&quot;butter tower&quot;) financed by the sale of indulgences for the consumption of butter during Lent. The cathedral&#x27;s gothic façade (completed in the 16th century) was the subject of a series of paintings by Claude Monet, some of which are exhibited in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay in Paris.

The &quot;Gros Horloge&quot; is an astronomical clock dating back to the 14th century. It is located in the Gros Horloge street.

Other famous structures include Rouen Castle, whose keep is known as the &quot;tour Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot;, where Joan of Arc was brought in 1431 to be threatened with torture (contrary to popular belief, she was not imprisoned there but in the &quot;tour de lady Pucelle&quot;(since destroyed); the &quot;Church of Saint Ouen&quot; (12th–15th century); the &quot;Palais de Justice&quot;, which was once the seat of the &quot;Parlement&quot; (French court of law) of Normandy; the Gothic &quot;Church of St Maclou&quot; (15th century); and the Museum of Fine Arts and Ceramics which contains a splendid collection of faïence and porcelain for which Rouen was renowned during the 16th to 18th centuries. Rouen is also noted for its surviving half-timbered buildings.

There are many museums in Rouen: the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen, an art museum with paintings by well-known artists such as Claude Monet and Géricault; the Musée maritime fluvial et portuaire, a museum on the history of the port of Rouen and navigation; Musée des antiquités, an art and history museum with local works from the Bronze Age through the Renaissance, the Musée de la céramique, the Museum of Natural History, founded in 1834 and re-opened in 2007, and the Musée Le Secq des Tournelles, which houses various collections of objects.

The Jardin des Plantes de Rouen is a notable botanical garden once owned by Scottish banker John Law, dating from 1840 in its present form. It was the site of Élisa Garnerin&#x27;s parachute jump from a balloon in 1817. There is also a park and garden at the Champs de Mars, to the east of the city centre. The Paris–Rouen motor race of 1894, &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot; Horseless Carriages Contest, ended at the Champs de Mars.

In the centre of the Place du Vieux Marché (the site of Joan of Arc&#x27;s pyre) is the modern church of St Joan of Arc. This is a large, modern structure which dominates the square. The form of the building represents an upturned Viking boat and a fish shape.

Rouen was also home to the French Grand Prix, hosting the race at the nearby Rouen-Les-Essarts track sporadically between 1952 and 1968. In 1999 Rouen authorities demolished the grandstands and other remnants of Rouen&#x27;s racing past. Today, little remains beyond the public roads that formed the circuit.

Rouen has an opera house, whose formal name is &quot;Rouen Normandy Opera House – Theatre of Arts&quot; (in French: &quot;Opéra de Rouen Normandie – Théâtre des arts&quot;).

==Climate==
Rouen has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot; in the Köppen climate classification).

==Transport==

Mainline trains operate from Gare de Rouen-Rive-Droite to Le Havre and Paris, and regional trains to Caen, Dieppe and other local destinations in Normandy. Daily direct trains operate to Amiens and Lille, and direct TGVs (high-speed trains) connect daily with Lyon and Marseille.

City transportation in Rouen consists of a tram and a bus system. The tramway branches into two lines out of a tunnel under the city centre. Rouen is also served by TEOR (Transport Est-Ouest Rouennais) and by buses run in conjunction with the tramway by TCAR (Transports en commun de l&#x27;agglomération rouennaise), a subsidiary of Transdev.

Rouen has its own airport.

The Seine is a major axis for maritime cargo links in the Port of Rouen. The Cross-Channel ferry ports of Caen, Le Havre, Dieppe (50 minutes) and Calais, and the Channel Tunnel are within easy driving distance (two and a half hours or less).

==Administration==
Rouen and its metropolitan area of 70 suburban communes form the Métropole Rouen Normandie, with 494,382 inhabitants at the 2010 census. In descending order of population, the largest of these suburbs are Sotteville-lès-Rouen, Saint-Étienne-du-Rouvray, Le Grand-Quevilly, Le Petit-Quevilly, and Mont-Saint-Aignan, each with a population exceeding 20,000. The city council is based at the Hôtel de Ville.

==Education==
The main schools of higher education are the University of Rouen and NEOMA Business School (former École Supérieure de Commerce de Rouen), Unilasalle (agronomy and agriculture), both located at nearby Mont-Saint-Aignan, and the INSA Rouen, ESIGELEC, ESITech and the CESI, the three at nearby Saint-Étienne-du-Rouvray.

==Sculpture==
During the second half of the 20th century, several sculptures by Jean-Yves Lechevallier were erected in the city. Inaugurated in 2010, the Rouen Impressionnée hosted the contemporary urban (re)development installation sculpture &#x27;Camille&#x27; by Belgian artist Arne Quinze. Quinze&#x27;s use of interlocking systems in sculpture employ wood, concrete, paint and metal. The Quasi-Quinze method of sculpture utilizes structural integrity and randomness as key elements for &#x27;Camille&#x27;. Located on the Boieldieu Bridge in the center of Rouen, this intentional location was chosen by the artist to magnify the historical separation of its city&#x27;s citizens.

==Representations in art==
Rouen Cathedral is the subject of a series of paintings by the Impressionist painter Claude Monet, who painted the same scene at different times of the day. Two paintings are in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.; two are in the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow; one is in the National Museum of Serbia in Belgrade. The estimated value of one painting is over $40 million.

<text>Solothurn ( ; ; ; ; ) is a town, a municipality, and the capital of the canton of Solothurn in Switzerland. It is located in the north-west of Switzerland on the banks of the Aare and on the foot of the Weissenstein Jura mountains.

The town is the only municipality of the district of the same name.

The town got its name from Salodurum, a Roman-era settlement. From 1530 to 1792 it was the seat of the French ambassador to Switzerland. The pedestrian-only old town was built between 1530 and 1792 and shows an impressive array of Baroque architecture, combining Italian Grandezza, French style, and Swiss ideas. The town has eighteen structures listed as heritage sites.

The official language of Solothurn is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect.

==History==

===Pre-Roman settlement===
The oldest finds from Solothurn probably date from the Paleolithic era. The remains of a Mesolithic camp were discovered in 1986 during renovations of the former &quot;Kino Elite&quot; building. From the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Age, only a few scattered items have been discovered.

===Roman settlement===
The Roman settlement at Solothurn was probably built around AD 15–25 as a road station and bridge head on the road from Aventicum to Augusta Raurica or Vindonissa. A small vicus or settlement quickly developed around the castrum. Solothurn is first mentioned in 219 as &quot;vico salod[uro]&quot; on the so-called Eponastein. The name may indicate either that a Celtic settlement existed on the site before or just be a testimony to the mixed Gallo-Roman culture in the north-west provinces of the Roman Empire. It came to be known as &quot;Salodurum&quot;, this name believed to derive from a Celtic language, possibly meaning &quot;Salo&#x27;s fort,&quot; from the personal name Salo + Proto-Celtic *&quot;dūnom&quot;, meaning &quot;fort&quot; or &quot;stronghold,&quot; likely influenced by the Latin &quot;durus&quot;, meaning &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;strong,&quot; as in other place names. Its strategical importance lay in the position at the approach to the Rhine from southeast. In the 2nd–3rd century AD, the vicus expanded rapidly to fill almost all of what is now the old town of Solothurn, including a portion of today&#x27;s suburb south of the Aare.

The Roman bridge was probably somewhat above the current Wengibrücke. The Roman era river bed was north of the present Aare. The main street of the Vicus was well below the present main street. In addition to the normal government of the settlement, there were two mayors (magistri), and a six-member college (seviri Augustales), which was entrusted with supporting the imperial cult. Salodurum was also home to a guard detachment of the XXII Legion, whose high command was stationed in Mainz in Germany. According to inscriptions, there was a temple of Jupiter, a temple of Apollo Augustus and an altar to the goddess of horses Epona, who was popular in the Roman military and of Celtic origin. However, the locations of those three temples is not known. There was bath house on the main street and a pottery district in the northwest of the town which have been documented archaeologically. A cemetery with urns and cremation burials on the eastern end of the Vicus was discovered in 1762–63 during the demolition of the old church of St. Ursus. In addition, two Roman tombs were discovered in the same area.

Around 325–350, the unfortified settlement along the road was transformed into a fortified camp or castrum, which covered only half of the former settlement area. A thick and high wall was built around the settlement. The new, fortified town was bell-shaped, and is still visible in the cadastral map of the town. At various points in the town, large and small pieces of the old Roman wall are still visible in the houses of the old town. The location of a gate in the north and a tower in the south-east corner are known and it is likely that there were additional gates and towers. Almost nothing is known about the buildings inside the walls.

===Early Middle Ages===

In the Early Middle Ages there were two settlement centres, a secular settlement in the former castrum and a religious settlement on the grounds of the late-Roman cemeteries outside the walls. Both the religious histories and archeological discoveries indicate that both areas remained inhabited continuously into the Early Middle Ages. The former chapel of St. Stephen inside the castrum was built on the foundation of an earlier, late-Roman building. A burial memorial in the cemetery of the nearby St. Peter&#x27;s Chapel dates to around the collapse of the Roman Empire. By the middle of the 5th century, St. Eucherius of Lyon mentions the martyrdom of St. Ursus and St. Victor and a cult of saints in Solothurn. About 500 AD, the Burgundian Princess Sedeleuba took the bones of St. Victor to Geneva, while the bones of St. Ursus remained in Solothurn. The church dedicated to the veneration of Saint Ursus is first mentioned in 870.

===Medieval city===

During the Early Middle Ages, Solothurn was part of the Kingdom of Lotharingia (Lorraine). After the collapse of Lotharingia, it became part of the Second Kingdom of Burgundy. In 1033, the Kingdom of Burgundy became part of the Holy Roman Empire and Solothurn gained some independence. In 1038, Emperor Conrad II held court at Solothurn and there crowned his son, Henry III King of Burgundy. The royal court resided in Solothurn on several occasions until 1052, however, there is no evidence of a permanent royal palace. In 1127, it was acquired by the dukes of Zähringen. Under the rule of the Zähringens, in 1146, Solothurn&#x27;s coins are first mentioned. In 1182, &quot;causidicus&quot; or Zähringen appointed judges first appeared in Solothurn. After the extinction of the Zähringer line in 1218 it became a free imperial city under the Holy Roman Emperor. In 1252, the town council and Schultheiss or mayor became mostly independent and had their own town seals. In 1251 it was mentioned as &quot;saluerre&quot; and in 1275 as &quot;Solotren&quot;. Starting around 1200, there was a council of nobles in the town.

In 1252, a group of nobles that could witness and support deeds, known as &quot;consuls et cives Solodorenses&quot;, first appears in the town. Initially the nobles exercised power over the entire town. However, the guild movement of the 14th century resulted in a reduction in the power of the nobles and also a restricted guild system in Solothurn. By around 1350, an eleven-member &quot;Altrat&quot; (Council of Elders) and a 22-member &quot;Jungrat&quot; (Younger Council) existed in the city. Each of the eleven guilds were represented by a member of the &quot;Altrat&quot; and two members of the &quot;Jungrat&quot;. These 33 councillors exercised, together with the mayor, the power of government and helped appoint lawmakers. The members of the two councils were elected each year by the citizens of the city, after which the councils and mayor appointed many of the government officials. The noble families retained some power as the guilds became part of the town council. However, in 1459 the last noble family died out and positions on the council fell to wealthy farmers, butchers and millers.

Until the pogrom on 1348 during an outbreak of the plague, there was a small Jewish community in Solothurn.

Over the 13th to 15th centuries, the citizens of the city slowly emancipated themselves from the higher nobility. In 1276 and 1280 Emperor Rudolf I codified the previously poorly defined rights of the city and granted it the privilege &quot;de non Evocando&quot; or the right that their citizens were protected from trial in foreign courts. In 1344 Solothurn acquired the right to appoint their own Schultheiss from the Count of Buchegg, which was confirmed by Emperor Charles IV in 1360. In 1409, Emperor Ruprecht extended the &quot;de non Evocando&quot; privilege to include the royal High Court as well.

As the city grew in power, it bound the Monastery of St. Ursus more closely to the city. In 1251 the city defeated claims made by the Monastery on the right to appoint the Schultheiss. Shortly after the acquisition of the right to the Schultheiss office in 1344, the city came into possession of the vogt right over the Monastery by granting citizenship rights to the former vogt (bailiff), Burkhard Senn the Elder. In 1512–20 the city received the right to appoint canons and provosts from the Pope.

After the alliance with Bern in 1295, it became part of the Swiss Confederation. In 1382 the Habsburgs attacked the city, involving Solothurn in the Battle of Sempach. By the treaty of two years later, the Habsburgs renounced all claims to the territory of the city. The latter was expanded by acquisition of neighbouring lands in the 15th century, roughly up to the today&#x27;s canton area.

In 1481, it obtained full membership in the Swiss Confederation.

===Buildings in the medieval city===

Before 1200 there was a Zähringer fortified tower north of the Monastery of St. Ursus. In the first half of the 13th century, a city wall was built around the area of the former castrum as well as the adjoining industrial area to the east and the churches of St. Peter and St. Urs. Near the Monastery of St. Ursus, a Franciscan monastery was built, and after 1280 it formed the northern city wall on the eastern part of the city. In 1532, the French embassy with a church and stately home was built in the eastern half of the city. In the western part of Solothurn, the town hall was built. First it was along the main street and in 1476 it moved south of the Franciscan monastery. A main market place grew up along the main street, and in the first half of the 17th century it moved to the northern banks of the Aare. The town hall, market place and clock tower formed the political and economic centre of city life.

===Early modern Solothurn===
The medieval cooperative election of the mayor and councillors led to the creation of a nearly hereditary oligarchy by the 15th century. By the second half of the 16th century, the political voice of citizens was nearly totally suppressed. By the second half of the 17th century, the government was run by a small group of patricians. The oligarchs were weakened in the 18th century, when in 1718–21 the city council managed to regain some powers. However, in 1682, a new citizenship law prevented wealthy families who had moved into Solothurn from becoming members of the council. While this law reduced the number of people who could be on the city council, the introduction of a secret ballot procedure in 1764 and measures against vote-buying in 1774 allowed more and more non-patrician burghers to join the council.

During the heyday of the patricians in the 17th and 18th centuries, a number of elegant town houses (Reinert House 1692–93, Palais Besenval 1703–06) and summer residences outside the city (Sommerhaus Vigier 1648–50, Waldegg Castle 1682–86 (now in nearby Feldbrunnen-St. Niklaus), Steinbrugg Castle 1665–68 and Blumenstein Castle 1725–28) were built. A number of new public buildings were also added including; the Arsenal (1610–19), the town hall with its north staircase tower (1632–34) and its eastern façade (Archive tower 1624, completed 1703–14), the Jesuit church (1680–89), the new Ambassadorenhof (1717–24), the Holy Spirit Hospital in a suburb (1735–1800) and the new classicist Church of St. Ursus (1763–90). In the 16th century the town walls were reinforced with the Basel gate and three round towers.

Between 1667 and 1727, following plans by Francesco Polatta, Jacques Le Prestre Tarade and Sébastien de Vauban, the city built fortifications with eleven full and half bastions. The new city wall increased the size of the city by including the eastern suburb of Kreuzacker. Until the 18th century, prisoners were housed in the towers of the medieval and early modern fortifications store. Between 1753 and 1761 a new prison was built outside the city walls, which remained in use into the 20th century. A gallows was first mentioned in 1460 and was located northeast of the city near Feldbrunnen. A second gallows was located to the southwest of the city.

From 1530 to 1792 it was the seat of the French ambassador to Switzerland.

The early modern period in Solothurn ended, as in the rest of Switzerland, with the French invasion in 1798.

===Modern Solothurn===

Following the capitulation of Solothurn on 2 March 1798, the French General Balthazar Alexis Henri Schauenburg set up a provisional government on the following day. The new government met in April to set up the new constitution. The eleven old &quot;Vogtei&quot; (baillywicks) were replaced by five districts: Solothurn, Biberist, Balsthal, Olten, and Dornach. The municipal Bürgergemeinde laid claim to the assets of the defunct city-state and in 1801 it received the &quot;Sönderungsconvention&quot;, large estates and extensive forest land outside the town. In 1831 the cantonal parliament withdrew all political power from the eleven city guilds. Over the following years (1831–1842) all the guilds were dissolved. Due to the municipal law of 1859, the enforcement of the Federal Constitution of 1874 and the Cantonal Constitution of 1875, an &quot;Einwohnergemeinde&quot; was created. The &quot;Einwohnergemeinde&quot; included all residents of the town, as opposed to the more limited &quot;Bürgergemeinde&quot;. The division of property between residents and the Bürgergemeinde proved to be lengthy and could not be completed until 1978 and then only with the help of the Executive Council.

In 1828 Solothurn became the seat of the Bishop of Basel.

Since 1897, the municipal council has been elected by proportional voting and consists of 30 members and 15 alternate members. As the executive body, it elects the council commission (seven members). Mayor and Vice-Mayor are elected by the people. The municipal assembly is the legislative body. The composition of the council remained remarkably stable between 1917 and 1973. The Liberals held an average of 60% of the seats, the Social Democrats and the Conservative People&#x27;s Party (CVP today), about 20% each. In 1970, the municipality granted voting rights for women. With the emergence of new parties, the Liberals lost its dominant position. 2009, the FDP 30%, SP 23%, CVP 23%, the Greens 17% and 7% of the votes go to the SVP.

Rock band Krokus was formed in Solothurn in 1974.

<text>Regensburg (historically known in English as Ratisbon) is a city in eastern Bavaria, at the confluence of the Danube, Naab and Regen rivers, Danube&#x27;s northernmost point. It is the capital of the Upper Palatinate subregion of the state. With more than 150,000 inhabitants, Regensburg is the fourth-largest city in the State of Bavaria after Munich, Nuremberg and Augsburg and the 8th largest of all cities on the Danube river. From its foundation as an imperial Roman river fort, the city has been the political, economic and cultural centre of the surrounding region. Later, under the rule of the Holy Roman Empire, it housed the Perpetual Diet of Regensburg.

The medieval centre of the city was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006 because of its well-preserved architecture, being the biggest medieval city site north of the Alps, and the city&#x27;s historical importance for assemblies during the Holy Roman Empire. In 2014, Regensburg was among the top sights and travel attractions in Germany.

==History==
===Early history===
The first settlements in the Regensburg area date from the Stone Age. The oldest Celtic name given to a settlement near Regensburg was Radasbona, a site where a Roman fort was built around AD 90. In 179, a major new Roman fort, called Castra Regina (&quot;fortress by the river Regen&quot;), was built for Legio III &quot;Italica&quot; during the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius. It was an important camp at the most northerly point of the Danube; it corresponds to what is today the core of Regensburg&#x27;s Old City or &quot;Altstadt&quot; east of the Obere and Untere Bachgasse and west of the Schwanenplatz. It is believed that as early as the late Roman period the city was the seat of a bishop.

From the early 6th century, Regensburg was the seat of a ruling family known as the Agilolfings. From about 530 to the first half of the 13th century, it was the capital of Bavaria. The bishopric established by the Romans was re-established by St Boniface as the Bishopric of Regensburg in 739. In the late 8th century, Regensburg remained an important city during the reign of Charlemagne. In 792, Regensburg hosted the ecclesiastical section of Charlemagne&#x27;s General Assembly, the bishops in council who condemned the heresy of the nontrinitarian adoptionism doctrine taught by their Spanish counterparts, Elipandus of Toledo and Felix of Urgell. After the partition of the Carolingian Empire in 843, the city became the seat of the Eastern Frankish ruler, Louis the German. Two years later, 14 Bohemian princes came to Regensburg to receive baptism there. This was the starting point of the Christianization of the Czechs, and the diocese of Regensburg became the mother diocese of that of Prague. These events had a wide impact on the cultural history of the Czech lands, as they were consequently part of the Roman Catholic and not the Slavic-Orthodox world. On 8 December 899 Arnulf of Carinthia, a descendant of Charlemagne, died at Regensburg.

By the High Middle Ages in the year 1000, the population increased to 40,000 from 23,000 inhabitants in 800. In 1096, on the way to the First Crusade, Peter the Hermit led a mob of crusaders who attempted to force the mass conversion of Jews in Regensburg, they then killed all those who resisted. Between 1135 and 1146, the Stone Bridge across the Danube was built at Regensburg. This bridge opened major international trade routes between northern Europe and Venice, and this began Regensburg&#x27;s golden age as a residence of wealthy trading families. Regensburg became the cultural centre of southern Germany and was celebrated for its gold work and fabrics.

===Late Middle Ages and early modern period===

In 1245 Regensburg became a Free Imperial City and was a trade centre before the shifting of trade routes in the late Middle Ages. Regensburg has always been a place where international meetings were held. This was also the case in 1471 when a war against the Turks was to be decided. In 1486, Regensburg became part of the Duchy of Bavaria, but its independence was restored by the Holy Roman Emperor ten years later. The first Diet of Regensburg took place in 1541. The city adopted the Protestant Reformation in 1542 and its Town Council remained entirely Lutheran.

From 1663 to 1806, the city was the permanent seat of the Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire, which became known as the Perpetual Diet of Regensburg. Thus, Regensburg was one of the central towns of the Empire, attracting visitors in large numbers.

A minority of the population remained Roman Catholic, and Roman Catholics were denied civic rights (&#x27;). Although the Imperial city had adopted the Reformation, the town remained the seat of a Roman Catholic bishop and several abbeys. Three of these, St. Emmeram, Niedermünster and Obermünster, were free imperial estates within the Holy Roman Empire, meaning that they were granted a seat and a vote at the Imperial Diet (&#x27;). So there was the unique situation that the town of Regensburg comprised five independent &quot;states&quot; (in terms of the Holy Roman Empire): the Protestant city itself, the Roman Catholic bishopric, and the three monasteries. In addition, it was seen as the traditional capital of the region Bavaria (not the state), acted as functional co-capital of the Empire (second to the Emperor&#x27;s court at Vienna) due to the presence of the Perpetual Diet, and it was the residence of the Emperor&#x27;s Commissary-Principal to the same diet, who with one very brief exception was a prince himself (for many years the Prince of Thurn and Taxis, still resident in the town).

===Late modern period===

In 1803 the city lost its status as an imperial city following its incorporation into the Principality of Regensburg. It was handed over to the Archbishop-Elector of Mainz and Archchancellor of the Holy Roman Empire Carl von Dalberg in compensation for the territory of the Electorate of Mainz located on the left bank of the Rhine which had been annexed by France under the terms of the Treaty of Lunéville in 1801. The Archbishopric of Mainz was formally transferred to Regensburg. Dalberg united the bishopric, the monasteries, and the town itself, making up the Principality of Regensburg (&quot;Fürstentum Regensburg&quot;). Dalberg strictly modernized public life. Most importantly, he awarded equal rights to Protestants and Roman Catholics alike. In 1810 Dalberg ceded Regensburg to the Kingdom of Bavaria, he himself being compensated by the award of Fulda and Hanau to him under the title of &quot;Grand Duke of Frankfurt&quot;.

Between April 19 and April 23, 1809, Regensburg was the scene of the Battle of Ratisbon between forces commanded by Henri Gatien Bertrand and Napoleon himself and the retreating Austrian forces. The city was eventually overrun, after supplies and ammunition ran out. The city suffered severe damage during the fight, with about 150 houses being burnt and others being looted. Robert Browning&#x27;s poem &quot;Incident at the French Camp&quot; describes the battle from the French perspective, but is filled with historical errors.

===Nazism and World War II===

The Jewish community was persecuted after the Nazi Party came to power in Germany in 1933, many Jews fled in the following years, and some were also expelled to Poland; thanks, however, to a Polish-German agreement they were allowed to return to the city. On November 9, 1938, during the Kristallnacht, the Regensburg Synagogue and several Jewish homes and stores were destroyed, and around 220 Jews were arrested, some were also deported to the Dachau concentration camp. During World War II, many Jews emigrated to various countries, and in 1942, over 200 Jews were deported either to Piaski in German-occupied Poland or the Theresienstadt Ghetto in German-occupied Czechoslovakia. In the final months of World War II, in March and April 1945, the Regensburg subcamp of the Flossenbürg concentration camp was located in the city, with 460 forced laborers of various nationalities, 40 of whom died.

Regensburg was home to both a Messerschmitt Bf 109 aircraft factory and an oil refinery, which were bombed by the Allies on August 17, 1943, in the Schweinfurt-Regensburg mission, and on February 5, 1945, during the Oil Campaign of World War II. Although both targets were badly damaged, Regensburg itself suffered little damage from the Allied strategic bombing campaign, and the nearly intact medieval city centre is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city&#x27;s most important cultural loss was that of the Romanesque church of Obermünster, which was destroyed in a March 1945 air raid and was not rebuilt (the belfry survived). Also, Regensburg&#x27;s slow economic recovery after the war ensured that historic buildings were not torn down and replaced by newer ones. When the upswing in restoration reached Regensburg in the late 1960s, the prevailing mindset had turned in favour of preserving the city&#x27;s heritage.

===History after 1945===

Between 1945 and 1949, Regensburg was the site of the largest displaced persons (DP) camp in Germany. At its peak in 1946–1947, the workers&#x27; district of Ganghofersiedlung housed almost 5,000 Ukrainian and 1,000 non-Ukrainian refugees and displaced persons. With the approval of U.S. Military Government in the American Allied Occupation Zone, Regensburg and other DP camps organised their own camp postal service. In Regensburg, the camp postal service began operation on December 11, 1946.

At the beginning of the 1960s, Regensburg invested heavily in technical and social infrastructure to attract industry. Siemens was the first multinational company to come to Regensburg, a significant step in the city&#x27;s development after World War II. In 1965, Regensburg University was founded; Regensburg University of Applied Sciences was established in 1971. The second multinational company, BMW, arrived in 1986 and set up a large production plant. Since the 1990s, several well-known hightech companies have been located in Regensburg, such as Infineon and OSRAM, contributing to the city&#x27;s current wealth.

In 1997, Regensburg was awarded the Europe Prize for its outstanding achievements in European integration.

The World Heritage Committee listed Regensburg&#x27;s Old Town a UNESCO World Heritage Site in July 2006.

==Geography==
===Topography===
Regensburg is situated on the northernmost part of the Danube river at the geological crossroads of four distinct landscapes:

*to the north and northeast lies the Bavarian Forest with granite and gneiss mountains, wide forests and its national park
*to the east and south-east is the fertile Danube plain (Gäuboden) which are highly cultivated loess plains
*the south is dominated by the Tertiary Hill Country, a continuation of Alpine Foreland
*to the West is Franconian Jura

===Climate===
Regensburg straddles the humid continental (&quot;Dfb&quot;) and oceanic (&quot;Cfb&quot;) climate zones under the Köppen climate classification. While the average temperature of in the period from 1971 to 2000 is slightly above the German average (), still only 5 of the 80 cities in Germany above 100,000 inhabitants are colder. The average precipitation of per year ranges slightly below the German average (approximately ). For the newer period from 1981 to 2010 the average temperature and precipitation rose up to respectively . As this increase in the average temperature can also be seen in the other cities, Regensburg still ranks fifth place (shared with Ingolstadt and Kiel) in the above-mentioned ranking. With a total of 1670 sunshine hours per year, Regensburg is roughly 120 hours above German average.

The warmest month of the year, on average, is July. The coolest month of the year, on average, is January.

==Main sights==
===City===


Regensburg includes the largest medieval old town north of the Alps with nearly 1,500 listed buildings and a picturesque cityscape. Its most famous sights are located mainly in the Old Town, such as:

*The &quot;Dom&quot; (Cathedral) is an example of pure German Gothic and is regarded as the main work of Gothic architecture in Bavaria. It was founded in 1275 and completed in 1634, with the exception of the towers, which were finished in 1869. The interior contains numerous interesting monuments, including one of Peter Vischer&#x27;s masterpieces. Adjoining the cloisters are two chapels which predate the cathedral. One of these, known as the old cathedral, goes back perhaps to the 8th century. The official choir for the liturgical music at St Peter&#x27;s Cathedral is the famous Regensburger Domspatzen (&quot;cathedral sparrows&quot;).
*The stone bridge, built 1135–1146, is a highlight of medieval bridge building. The knights of the 2nd and 3rd crusades used it to cross the Danube on their way to the Holy Land.
*The Regensburg Sausage Kitchen is a major tourist destination, but locals eat there as well. It was originally built as the construction headquarters of the stone bridge and now lies adjacent to it.
*Remains of the Roman fortress&#x27; walls including the Porta Praetoria.
*The Church of St. James, also called &quot;Schottenkirche&quot;, a Romanesque basilica of the 12th century, derives its name from the monastery of Irish Benedictines (Scoti) to which it was attached; the principal doorway is covered with very unusual grotesque carvings. It stands next to the &quot;Jakobstor&quot;, a medieval city gate named after it.
*The old parish church of St. Ulrich is a good example of the Transition style of the 13th century, and contains a valuable antiquarian collection. It houses the diocesan museum of religious art.
*Examples of the Romanesque basilica style are the church of Obermünster, dating from 1010, and the abbey church of St. Emmeram, built in the 13th century, remarkable as one of the few German churches with a detached bell tower. The cloisters of the ancient abbey, one of the oldest in Germany, are still in a fair state of preservation. In 1809 the conventual buildings were converted into a palace for the prince of Thurn and Taxis, hereditary postmaster-general of the Holy Roman Empire.
*The Adler-Apotheke, located nearby the Regensburg Cathedral, was founded in 1610 and is one of the oldest pharmacies in Regensburg. The ancient interior and historical vessels can be viewed.
*Wealthy patrician families competed against each other to see who could build the highest tower of the city. In 1260, the &quot;Goldener Turm&quot; (golden tower) was built on Wahlenstraße.
*The Old Town Hall, dating in part from the 14th century, contains the rooms occupied by the Imperial Diet from 1663 to 1806.
*The &quot;Gasthof zum Goldenen Kreuz&quot; (Golden Cross Inn) is also of historical interest: it is where Charles V made the acquaintance of Barbara Blomberg, the mother of Don John of Austria.
*The statue of John of Austria, born 1547 in Regensburg, was erected 1978 on the fourth centenary of his death and is a copy of a monument in Messina, Italy. 
*Perhaps the most pleasant modern building in the city is the Gothic villa of the king of Bavaria on the bank of the Danube. The grounds are now opened to public and known as VillaPark.
*Among the public institutions of the city are the public library, picture gallery, botanical garden, and the institute for the making of stained glass. The city&#x27;s colleges (apart from the University of Regensburg) include an episcopal clerical seminary, and a school of church music.
*St. Emmeram&#x27;s Abbey, now known as Schloss Thurn und Taxis, is a huge castle owned by the powerful Thurn and Taxis family.
*Schloss Höfling, a castle owned by the Thurn und Taxis family
*The City Park, the oldest and largest park in Regensburg with a lot of artwork. 
*The Botanischer Garten der Universität Regensburg is a modern botanical garden located on the University of Regensburg campus.
*Herzogspark also contains several small botanical gardens.

===Surroundings===
Near Regensburg there are two very imposing classical buildings erected by Ludwig I of Bavaria as national monuments dedicated to German patriotism and greatness:
*The more imposing of the two is the &quot;Walhalla&quot;, a costly reproduction of the Parthenon, erected as a Teutonic temple of fame on a hill rising from the Danube at Donaustauf, to the east. The interior, which is richly decorated with coloured marble, gilding and sculptures, contains the busts of more than one hundred notable Germans.
*The second of King Ludwig&#x27;s buildings is the &quot;Befreiungshalle&quot; at Kelheim, higher up the Danube. It is a large circular monument built for the glorification of the heroes of the 1813 War of Liberation.

Weltenburg Abbey (Kloster Weltenburg), a Benedictine monastery, is located in Weltenburg near the town of Kelheim. The abbey is situated on a peninsula of the Danube, by what are known as the &quot;Weltenburg Narrows&quot; or &quot;Danube Gorge&quot;. The monastery, founded by Irish or Scottish monks in about 620, is said to be the oldest monastery in Bavaria.

To the east of Regensburg lies the Bavarian Forest and its National Park, one of the most visited protected areas in Germany.

Regensburg is on the designated heritage route, the Route of Emperors and Kings.

Regensburg has two open air cinemas as well.

===Dialect===
Although the German language is Germany&#x27;s official language, Regensburg is considered a part of the Bavarian dialect language area (&#x27;) which encompasses much of Bavaria, Austria, and the South Tyrolean region of northern Italy. More specifically, the dialect attributed to Regensburg is called Central Bavarian (&#x27;). A 2019 report estimates that about half of Bavaria&#x27;s 12 million inhabitants speak a variation of the Bavarian dialect.

The first dictionary of a German dialect was Johann Ludwig Prasch&#x27;s &#x27;. Published in Regensburg in 1689, it contains 500 words from the Bavarian variation spoken in Regensburg. Regensburg&#x27;s &quot;Bauerntheater&quot;, a type of farmers&#x27; or folk theater, has staged plays delivered in Bavarian for over 90 years. Moreover, premiering in 2011, Joseph Berlinger&#x27;s play &quot;Mei Fähr Lady,&quot; a story about three &quot;students&quot; taking a crash course in Bavarian dialect, has been performed at Regensburg&#x27;s Turmtheater over 300 times. In fact, the role of the dialect professor is played by Ludwig Zehetner, professor emeritus in Bavarian dialectology at University of Regensburg. Manfred Rohm, whose pen name Sepp Grantelhauer takes on the Bavarian verb &#x27; for &quot;to complain,&quot; writes a weekly satirical column solely in Bavarian for the &quot;&quot;.

<text>The Carthusians, also known as the Order of Carthusians (), are a Latin enclosed religious order of the Catholic Church. The order was founded by Bruno of Cologne in 1084 and includes both monks and nuns. The order has its own rule, called the &quot;Statutes&quot;, and their life combines both eremitical and cenobitic monasticism. The motto of the Carthusians is , Latin for &quot;The Cross is steady while the world turns.&quot; The Carthusians retain a unique form of liturgy known as the Carthusian Rite.

The name &quot;Carthusian&quot; is derived from the Chartreuse Mountains in the French Prealps: Bruno built his first hermitage in a valley of these mountains. These names were adapted to the English &quot;charterhouse&quot;, meaning a Carthusian monastery. Today, there are 23 charterhouses, 18 for monks and 5 for nuns. The alcoholic cordial Chartreuse has been produced by the monks of Grande Chartreuse since 1737, which gave rise to the name of the color, though the liqueur is in fact produced not only as green chartreuse, but also as yellow chartreuse.

In Italy, the Carthusians are known as Certosini and their monastery as a Certosa.

==History==
In 1084 Bishop Hugh of Grenoble offered Bruno, the former Chancellor of the Diocese of Reims, a solitary site in the mountains of his diocese, in the valley of Chartreuse. There Bruno and six companions built a hermitage, consisting of a few wooden cabins opening towards a gallery that allowed them access to the communal areas, the church, the refectory, and the chapter room without having to suffer too much from inclement conditions.

Six years later, Bruno&#x27;s former pupil, Pope Urban II, requested his services. Bruno would only live in Rome for a few short months however, before leaving to establish a new hermitage in Serra San Bruno, in Calabria, a region of southern Italy. He died there on 6 October 1101.

In 1132, an avalanche destroyed the first hermitage, killing 7 monks under the snow. The fifth prior of Chartreuse, Guiges, rebuilt the hermitage.

===Carthusians in Britain===
There were ten Carthusian monasteries in Britain before the Reformation, with one in Scotland and nine in England. The first was founded by Henry II of England in 1181 at Witham Friary, Somerset as penance for the murder of Thomas Becket. Hugh of Lincoln was its first prior. The third Charterhouse built in Britain was Beauvale Priory, remains of which can still be seen in Beauvale, Greasley, Nottinghamshire.

The Carthusians, as with all Catholic religious orders, were variously persecuted and banned during the Reformation. The abolition of their priories, which were sources of charity in England, particularly reduced their numbers. This was followed by the French Revolution which had a similar effect in France.

The Charterhouse, Coventry has been conserved and was opened to the public in April 2023. The area, about a mile from the centre of the city, is a conservation area, and the buildings had been in use as part of a local college. Inside the building is a medieval wall painting, alongside many carvings and wooden beams. Nearby is the river Sherbourne which runs underneath the centre of the city.

The best preserved remains of a medieval Charterhouse in the UK are at Mount Grace Priory near Osmotherley, North Yorkshire. One of the cells has been reconstructed to illustrate how different the layout is from monasteries of most other Christian orders, which are normally designed with communal living in mind.

The London Charterhouse gave its name to Charterhouse Square and several streets in the City of London, as well as to the Charterhouse School which used part of its site before moving out to Godalming, Surrey.

Nothing remains at Hull or Sheen, although Hull Charterhouse is an almshouse that shared the site of the monastery. Axholme, Hinton, and Witham have slight remains.

Perth Charterhouse, the single Carthusian Priory founded in Scotland during the Middle Ages, was located in Perth. It stood just west of the medieval town and was founded by James I (1406–1437) in the early 15th century. James I and Joan Beaufort, Queen of Scots (died 1445) were both buried in the priory church, as was Queen Margaret Tudor (died 1541), widow of James IV of Scotland. The Priory, said to have been a building of &quot;wondrous cost and greatness&quot;, was sacked during the Scottish Reformation in 1559, and swiftly fell into decay. No remains survive above ground, though a Victorian monument marks the site. The Perth names Charterhouse Lane and Pomarium Flats (built on the site of the Priory&#x27;s orchard) recall its existence.

There is an active Carthusian house in England, St Hugh&#x27;s Charterhouse, Parkminster, West Sussex. This has cells around a square cloister approximately on a side, making it the largest cloister in Europe. It was built in the 19th century to accommodate two communities which were expelled from the continent.

== Charterhouse ==
The monastery is generally a small community of hermits based on the model of the 4th-century Lauras of Palestine. A Carthusian monastery consists of a number of individual cells built around a cloister. The individual cells are organised so that the door of each cell comes off a large corridor.

The focus of Carthusian life is contemplation. To this end, there is an emphasis on solitude and silence. Carthusians do not have abbots—instead, each charterhouse is headed by a prior and is populated by two types of monks: the choir monks, referred to as hermits, and the lay brothers. This reflects a division of labor in providing for the material needs of the monastery and the monks. For the most part, the number of brothers in the Order has remained the same for centuries, as it is now: seven or eight brothers for every ten fathers. Humility is a characteristic of Carthusian spirituality. The Carthusian identity is one of shared solitude.

===Musical practice===
Similar to the tradition of the Byzantine Rite, Carthusians eschew the use of musical instruments in worship.

===Choirmonks===
Each hermit, a monk who is or who will be a priest, has his own living space, called a cell, usually consisting of a small dwelling. Traditionally there is a one-room lower floor for the storage of wood for a stove and a workshop as all monks engage in some manual labour. A second floor consists of a small entryway with an image of the Virgin Mary as a place of prayer and a larger room containing a bed, a table for eating meals, a desk for study, a choir stall, and a kneeler for prayer. Each cell has a high-walled garden wherein the monk may meditate as well as grow flowers for himself and/or vegetables for the common good of the community, as a form of physical exercise.
Next to the door is a small revolving compartment, called a &quot;turn&quot;, so that meals and other items may be passed in and out of the cell without the hermit having to meet the bearer. Most meals are provided in this manner, which the hermit then eats in the solitude of his cell. There are two meals provided for much of the year: lunch and supper. During seasons or days of fasting, just one meal is provided. The hermit makes his needs known to the lay brother by means of a note, requesting items such as a fresh loaf of bread, which will be kept in the cell for eating with several meals. Carthusians observe a perpetual abstinence from meat.

The hermit spends most of his day in the cell: he meditates, prays the minor hours of the Liturgy of the Hours on his own, eats, studies and writes, and works in his garden or at some manual trade. Unless required by other duties, the Carthusian hermit leaves his cell daily only for three prayer services in the monastery chapel, including the community Mass, and occasionally for conferences with his superior. Additionally, once a week, the community members take a long walk in the countryside during which they may speak. On Sundays and solemn feast days a community meal is taken in silence. Twice a year there is a day-long community recreation, and the monk may receive an annual visit from immediate family members.

===Lay brothers===
There have always been lay brothers in the charterhouse. When Bruno retired to the Chartreuse, two of his companions were secular ones: Andrew and Guerin. They also live a life of solitary prayer and join in the communal prayer and Mass in the chapel. However, the lay brothers are monks under a slightly different type of vows and spend less time in contemplative prayer and more time in manual labour. The lay brothers provide material assistance to the choir monks: cooking meals, doing laundry, undertaking physical repairs, providing the choir monks with books from the library and managing supplies. The life of the brothers complements that of the choir monks and makes the fathers&#x27; lives of seclusion possible.

During the brothers&#x27; seven-year formation period, some time is given each day to the study of the Bible, theology, liturgy, and spirituality. They can continue their studies throughout their lives. All of the monks live lives of silence.

The Carthusians do not engage in work of a pastoral or missionary nature. Unlike most monasteries, they do not have retreatants, and those who visit for a prolonged period are people who are contemplating entering the monastery. As far as possible, the monks have no contact with the outside world.

Carthusian nuns live a life similar to the monks but with some differences. Choir nuns tend to lead somewhat less eremitical lives, while still maintaining a strong commitment to solitude and silence.

== Modern Carthusians ==

Today, the monastery of the Grande Chartreuse is still the Motherhouse of the order. There is a museum illustrating the history of the Carthusian order next to Grande Chartreuse; the monks of that monastery are also involved in producing Chartreuse liqueur. Visits are not possible into the Grande Chartreuse itself, but the 2005 documentary &quot;Into Great Silence&quot; gave unprecedented views of life within the hermitage.

Today, Carthusians live very much as they originally did, without any relaxing of their rules. Generally, those wishing to enter must be between the ages of twenty-one and forty-five. Nowadays, medical examinations are considered necessary before the Novitiate and Profession. The Carthusian novice is introduced to &quot;Lectio divina&quot; (spiritual reading).

In the 21st century, the Sélignac Charterhouse was converted into a house in which lay people could come and experience Carthusian retreats, living the Carthusian life for shorter periods (an eight-day retreat being fixed as the minimum, to enter at least somewhat into the silent rhythm of the charterhouse).

== Liturgy ==
Before the Council of Trent in the 16th century, the Catholic Church in Western Europe had a wide variety of rituals for the celebration of Mass. Although the essentials were the same, there were variations in prayers and practices from region to region or among the various religious orders.

When Pope Pius V made the Roman Missal mandatory for all Catholics of the Latin Church, he permitted the continuance of other forms of celebrating Mass that had an antiquity of at least two centuries. The rite used by the Carthusians was one of these and continues in use in a version revised in 1981. Apart from the new elements in this revision, it is substantially the rite of Grenoble in the 12th century, with some admixture from other sources. According to current Catholic legislation, priests can celebrate the traditional rites of their order without further authorization.

A feature unique to Carthusian liturgical practice is that the bishop bestows on Carthusian nuns, in the ceremony of their profession, a stole and a maniple. The nun, who may receive the consecration of virgins is then also invested with a crown and a ring. The nun wears these ornaments again only on the day of her monastic jubilee and on her bier after her death. At Matins, if no priest or deacon is present, a nun assumes the stole and reads the Gospel; and although in the time of the Tridentine Mass the chanting of the Epistle was reserved to an ordained subdeacon, a consecrated virgin sang the Epistle at the conventual Mass, though without wearing the maniple. For centuries Carthusian nuns retained this rite, administered by the diocesan bishop four years after the nun took her vows.

== Formation ==
The formation of a Carthusian begins with 6 to 12 months of postulancy. This is followed by two years of novitiate, where the novice wears a black cloak over the white Carthusian habit. Subsequently, the novice takes simple vows and becomes a junior professed for three years, during which the professed wears the full Carthusian habit. The simple vows may be renewed for another two years. Finally, the Carthusian makes the solemn profession.

== Locations of monasteries ==
, there are 21 extant charterhouses, 16 for monks and 5 for nuns, on three continents: Argentina (1), Brazil (1), France (6), Germany (1), Italy (3), Korea (2), Portugal (1), Slovenia (1), Spain (4), Switzerland (1), the United Kingdom (1) and the United States (1).

<text>Phoenix ( ) is the capital and most populous city of the U.S. state of Arizona, with 1,662,607 residents as of 2024. It is the fifth-most populous city in the United States and the most populous state capital in the country.

Phoenix is the most populous city of the Phoenix metropolitan area, also known as the Valley of the Sun, which in turn is part of the Salt River Valley and Arizona Sun Corridor. The metro area is the 10th-largest by population in the United States with approximately 4.95 million people , making it the most populous in the Southwestern United States. Phoenix, the seat of Maricopa County, is the largest city by population and area in Arizona, with an area of , and is also the 11th-largest city by area in the United States.

Phoenix was settled in 1867 as an agricultural community near the confluence of the Salt and Gila Rivers and was incorporated as a city in 1881. It became the capital of Arizona Territory in 1889. Its canal system led to a thriving farming community with the original settlers&#x27; crops, such as alfalfa, cotton, citrus, and hay, remaining important parts of the local economy for decades. Cotton, cattle, citrus, climate, and copper were known locally as the &quot;Five C&#x27;s&quot; anchoring Phoenix&#x27;s economy. These remained the driving forces of the city until after World War II, when high-tech companies began to move into the valley and air conditioning made Phoenix&#x27;s hot summers more bearable.

Phoenix is the cultural center of Arizona. It is in the northeastern reaches of the Sonoran Desert and is known for its hot desert climate. The region&#x27;s gross domestic product reached over $362 billion by 2022. The city averaged a four percent annual population growth rate over a 40-year period from the mid-1960s to the mid-2000s, and was among the nation&#x27;s ten most populous cities by 1980. Phoenix is also one of the largest plurality Hispanic cities in the United States, with 42% of its population being Hispanic.

==History==

===Early history===
The Hohokam people occupied the Phoenix area for 2,000 years. They created roughly of irrigation canals, making the desert land arable, and paths of these canals were used for the Arizona Canal, Central Arizona Project Canal, and the Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct. They also carried out extensive trade with the nearby Ancient Puebloans, Mogollon, and Sinagua, as well as with the more distant Mesoamerican civilizations. It is believed periods of drought and severe floods between 1300 and 1450 led to the Hohokam civilization&#x27;s abandonment of the area.

After the departure of the Hohokam, groups of Akimel O&#x27;odham (commonly known as Pima), Tohono O&#x27;odham, and Maricopa tribes began to use the area, as well as segments of the Yavapai and Apache. The O&#x27;odham were offshoots of the Sobaipuri tribe, who in turn were thought to be the descendants of the Hohokam.

The Akimel O&#x27;odham were the major group in the area. They lived in small villages with well-defined irrigation systems that spread over the Gila River Valley, from Florence in the east to the Estrellas in the west. Their crops included corn, beans, and squash for food as well as cotton and tobacco. They banded with the Maricopa for protection against incursions by the Yuma and Apache tribes. The Maricopa are part of the larger Yuma people; however, they migrated east from the lower Colorado and Gila Rivers in the early 1800s, when they began to be enemies with other Yuma tribes, settling among the existing communities of the Akimel O&#x27;odham.

The Tohono O&#x27;odham also lived in the region, but largely to the south and all the way to the Mexican border. The O&#x27;odham lived in small settlements as seasonal farmers who took advantage of the rains, rather than the large-scale irrigation of the Akimel. They grew crops such as sweet corn, tapery beans, squash, lentils, sugar cane, and melons, as well as taking advantage of native plants such as saguaro fruits, cholla buds, mesquite tree beans, and mesquite candy (sap from the mesquite tree). They also hunted local game such as deer, rabbit, and javelina for meat.

The Mexican–American War ended in 1848, Mexico ceded its northern zone to the United States, and the region&#x27;s residents became U.S. citizens. The Phoenix area became part of the New Mexico Territory. In 1863, the mining town of Wickenburg was the first to be established in Maricopa County, to the northwest of Phoenix. Maricopa County had not been incorporated; the land was within Yavapai County, which included the major town of Prescott to the north of Wickenburg.

The Army created Fort McDowell on the Verde River in 1865 to forestall Indian uprisings. The fort established a camp on the south side of the Salt River by 1866, which was the first settlement in the valley after the decline of the Hohokam. Other nearby settlements later merged to become the city of Tempe.

===Founding and incorporation===
The history of Phoenix begins with Jack Swilling, a Confederate veteran of the Civil War who prospected in the nearby mining town of Wickenburg in the newly formed Arizona Territory. As he traveled through the Salt River Valley in 1867, he saw a potential for farming to supply Wickenburg with food. He also noted the eroded mounds of dirt that indicated previous canals dug by native peoples who had long since left the area. He formed the Swilling Irrigation and Canal Company that year, dug a large canal that drew in river water, and erected several crop fields in a location that is now within the eastern portion of central Phoenix near its airport. Other settlers soon began to arrive, appreciating the area&#x27;s fertile soil and lack of frost, and the farmhouse Swilling constructed became a frequently-visited location in the valley. Lord Darrell Duppa was one of the original settlers in Swilling&#x27;s party, and he suggested the name &quot;Phoenix&quot;, as it described a city born from the ruins of a former civilization.

The Board of Supervisors in Yavapai County officially recognized the new town on May 4, 1868, and the first post office was established the following month with Swilling as the postmaster. In October 1870, valley residents met to select a new townsite for the valley&#x27;s growing population. A new location three miles to the west of the original settlement, containing several allotments of farmland, was chosen, and lots began to officially be sold under the name of Phoenix in December of that year. This established the downtown core in a grid layout pattern that has been the hallmark of Phoenix&#x27;s urban development ever since.

On February 12, 1871, the territorial legislature created Maricopa County by dividing Yavapai County; it was the sixth one formed in the Arizona Territory. The first election for county office was held in 1871 when Tom Barnum was elected the first sheriff. He ran unopposed when the other two candidates (John A. Chenowth and Jim Favorite) fought a duel; Chenowth killed Favorite and was forced to withdraw from the race.

The town grew during the 1870s, and President Ulysses S. Grant issued a land patent for the site of Phoenix on April 10, 1874. By 1875, the town had a telegraph office, 16 saloons, and four dance halls, but the townsite-commissioner form of government needed an overhaul. An election was held in 1875, and three village trustees and other officials were elected. By 1880, the town&#x27;s population stood at 2,453.

By 1881, Phoenix&#x27;s continued growth made the board of trustees obsolete. The Territorial Legislature passed the Phoenix Charter Bill, incorporating Phoenix and providing a mayor-council government; Governor John C. Fremont signed the bill on February 25, 1881, officially incorporating Phoenix as a city with a population of around 2,500.

The railroad&#x27;s arrival in the valley in the 1880s was the first of several events that made Phoenix a trade center whose products reached eastern and western markets. In response, the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce was organized on November 4, 1888. The city offices moved into the new City Hall at Washington and Central in 1888. The territorial capital moved from Prescott to Phoenix in 1889, and the territorial offices were also in City Hall. The arrival of the Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railway in 1895 connected Phoenix to Prescott, Flagstaff, and other communities in the northern part of the territory. The increased access to commerce expedited the city&#x27;s economic rise. The Phoenix Union High School was established in 1895 with an enrollment of 90.

===1901 to World War II===
On February 25, 1901, Governor Oakes Murphy dedicated the permanent Capitol building, and the Carnegie Free Library opened seven years later, on February 18, 1908, dedicated by Benjamin Fowler. The National Reclamation Act was signed by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1902, which allowed dams to be built on waterways in the west for reclamation purposes. The first dam constructed under the act, Salt River Dam#1, began in 1903. It supplied both water and electricity, becoming the first multi-purpose dam, and Roosevelt attended the official dedication on May 18, 1911. At the time, it was the largest masonry dam in the world, forming a lake in the mountains east of Phoenix. The dam would be renamed after Teddy Roosevelt in 1917, and the lake would follow suit in 1959.

On February 14, 1912, Phoenix became a state capital, as Arizona was admitted to the Union as the 48th state under President William Howard Taft. This occurred just six months after Taft had vetoed a joint congressional resolution granting statehood to Arizona, due to his disapproval of the state constitution&#x27;s position on the recall of judges. In 1913, Phoenix&#x27;s move from a mayor-council system to council-manager made it one of the first cities in the United States with this form of city government. After statehood, Phoenix&#x27;s growth started to accelerate; eight years later, its population reached 29,053. In 1920, Phoenix would see its first skyscraper, the Heard Building; it was the tallest building in the state until the completion of the Luhrs Building in 1924. In 1929, Sky Harbor was officially opened, at the time owned by Scenic Airways. The city purchased it in 1935 and continues to operate it today.

On March 4, 1930, former U.S. President Calvin Coolidge dedicated a dam on the Gila River named in his honor. However, the state had just been through a long drought, and the reservoir which was supposed to be behind the dam was virtually dry. The humorist Will Rogers, who was on hand as a guest speaker joked, &quot;If that was my lake, I&#x27;d mow it.&quot; Phoenix&#x27;s population had nearly doubled during the 1920s and by 1930 stood at 48,118. It was also during the 1930s that Phoenix and its surrounding area began to be called &quot;The Valley of the Sun&quot;, which was an advertising slogan invented to boost tourism.

During World War II, Phoenix&#x27;s economy shifted to that of a distribution center, transforming into an &quot;embryonic industrial city&quot; with the mass production of military supplies. There were three air force fields in the area: Luke Field, Williams Field, and Falcon Field, as well as two large pilot training camps, Thunderbird Field No. 1 in Glendale and Thunderbird Field No. 2 in Scottsdale.

===Post-World War II explosive growth===
A town that had just over 65,000 residents in 1940 became America&#x27;s fifth largest city by 2020, with a population of nearly 1.6 million, and millions more in nearby suburbs. After the war, many of the men who had undergone their training in Arizona returned with their new families. Learning of this large untapped labor pool enticed many large industries to move their operations to the area. In 1948, high-tech industry, which would become a staple of the state&#x27;s economy, arrived in Phoenix when Motorola chose Phoenix as the site of its new research and development center for military electronics. Seeing the same advantages as Motorola, other high-tech companies, such as Intel and McDonnell Douglas, moved into the valley and opened manufacturing operations.

By 1950, over 105,000 people resided in the city and thousands more in surrounding communities. The 1950s growth was spurred on by advances in air conditioning, which allowed homes and businesses to offset the extreme heat experienced in Phoenix and the surrounding areas during its long summers. There was more new construction in Phoenix in 1959 alone than from 1914 to 1946.

Like many emerging American cities at the time, Phoenix&#x27;s spectacular growth did not occur evenly. It largely took place on the city&#x27;s north side, a region that was nearly all Caucasian. In 1962, one local activist testified at a US Commission on Civil Rights of hearing that of 31,000 homes that had recently sprung up in this neighborhood, not a single one had been sold to an African-American. Phoenix&#x27;s African-American and Mexican-American communities remained largely sequestered on the south side of town. The color lines were so rigid that no one north of Van Buren Street would rent to the African-American baseball star Willie Mays, in town for spring training in the 1960s. In 1964, a reporter from &quot;The New Republic&quot; wrote of segregation in these terms: &quot;Apartheid is complete. The two cities look at each other across a golf course.&quot;

===1960s to present===
The continued rapid population growth led more businesses to the valley to take advantage of the labor pool, and manufacturing, particularly in the electronics sector, continued to grow. The convention and tourism industries saw rapid expansion during the 1960s, with tourism becoming the third largest industry by the end of the decade. In 1965, the Phoenix Corporate Center opened; at the time it was the tallest building in Arizona, topping off at 341 feet. The 1960s saw many other buildings constructed as the city expanded rapidly, including the Rosenzweig Center (1964), today called Phoenix City Square, the landmark Phoenix Financial Center (1964), as well as many of Phoenix&#x27;s residential high-rises. In 1965 the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum opened at the Arizona State Fairgrounds, west of downtown. When Phoenix was awarded an NBA franchise in 1968, which would be called the Phoenix Suns, they played their home games at the Coliseum until 1992, after which they moved to America West Arena. In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson approved the Central Arizona Project, assuring future water supplies for Phoenix, Tucson, and the agricultural corridor between them. The following year, Pope Paul VI created the Diocese of Phoenix on December 2, by splitting the Archdiocese of Tucson, with Edward A. McCarthy as the first Bishop.

In the 1970s the downtown area experienced a resurgence, with a level of construction activity not seen again until the urban real estate boom of the 2000s. By the end of the decade, Phoenix adopted the Phoenix Concept 2000 plan which split the city into urban villages, each with its own village core where greater height and density was permitted, further shaping the free-market development culture. The nine original villages have expanded to 15 over the years (see Cityscape below). This officially turned Phoenix into a city of many nodes, which would later be connected by freeways. The Phoenix Symphony Hall opened in 1972; other major structures which saw construction downtown during this decade were the First National Bank Plaza, the Valley Center (the tallest building in Arizona), and the Arizona Bank building.

On September 25, 1981, Phoenix resident Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor broke the gender barrier on the U.S. Supreme Court, when she was sworn in as the first female justice. In 1985, the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, the nation&#x27;s largest nuclear power plant, began electrical production. Pope John Paul II and Mother Teresa both visited the Valley in 1987.

There was an influx of refugees due to low-cost housing in the Sunnyslope area in the 1990s, resulting in 43 different languages being spoken in local schools by 2000. The new 20-story City Hall opened in 1992.

Phoenix has maintained a growth streak in recent years, growing by 24.2% before 2007. This made it the second-fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States, surpassed only by Las Vegas. In 2008, Squaw Peak, the city&#x27;s second tallest mountain, was renamed Piestewa Peak after Army Specialist Lori Ann Piestewa, an Arizonan and the first Native American woman to die in combat while serving in the U.S. military, as well as being the first American female casualty of the 2003 Iraq War. 2008 also saw Phoenix as one of the cities hardest hit by the subprime mortgage crisis, and by early 2009 the median home price was $150,000, down from its $262,000 peak in 2007. Crime rates in Phoenix have fallen in recent years, and once troubled, decaying neighborhoods such as South Mountain, Alhambra, and Maryvale have recovered and stabilized. On June 1, 2023, the State of Arizona announced the decision to halt new housing development in the Phoenix metropolitan area that relies solely on groundwater due to a predicted water shortfall.

==Geography==
Phoenix is in the south-central portion of Arizona; about halfway between Tucson to the southeast and Flagstaff to the north, in the Southwestern United States. By car, the city is approximately north of the US–Mexico border at Sonoyta and north of the border at Nogales. The metropolitan area is known as the &quot;Valley of the Sun&quot; due to its location in the Salt River Valley. It lies at a mean elevation of 1,086 feet (331 m), in the northern reaches of the Sonoran Desert.

Other than the mountains in and around the city, Phoenix&#x27;s topography is generally flat, which allows the city&#x27;s main streets to run on a precise grid with wide, open-spaced roadways. Scattered, low mountain ranges surround the valley: McDowell Mountains to the northeast, the White Tank Mountains to the west, the Superstition Mountains far to the east, and both South Mountain and the Sierra Estrella to the south/southwest. Camelback Mountain, North Mountain, Sunnyslope Mountain, and Piestewa Peak are within the heart of the valley. The city&#x27;s outskirts have large fields of irrigated cropland and Native American reservation lands. The Salt River runs westward through Phoenix, but the riverbed is often dry or contains little water due to large irrigation diversions. South Mountain separates the community of Ahwatukee from the rest of the city.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and , or 0.2%, is water.

Maricopa County grew by 711% from 186,000 in 1940 to 1,509,000 by 1980, due in part to air conditioning, cheap housing, and an influx of retirees. The once &quot;modest urban sprawl&quot; now &quot;grew by &#x27;epic&#x27; proportions—not only a myriad of residential tract developments on both farmland and desert.&quot; Retail outlets and office complexes spread out and did not concentrate in the small downtown area. There was low population density and a lack of widespread and significant high-rise development. As a consequence Phoenix became a textbook case of urban sprawl for geographers. Even though it is the fifth most populated city in the United States, the large area gives it a low density rate of approximately 2,797 people per square mile. In comparison, Philadelphia, the sixth most populous city with nearly the same population as Phoenix, has a density of over 11,000 people per square mile.

Like most of Arizona, Phoenix does not observe daylight saving time. In 1973, Governor Jack Williams argued to the U.S. Congress that energy use would increase in the evening should Arizona observe DST. He went on to say energy use would also rise early in the day &quot;because there would be more lights on in the early morning.&quot; Additionally, he said daylight saving time would cause children to go to school in the dark.

===Cityscape===


====Neighborhoods====
Since 1979, the city of Phoenix has been divided into urban villages, many of which are based upon historically significant neighborhoods and communities that have since been annexed into Phoenix. Each village has a planning committee appointed directly by the city council. According to the city-issued village planning handbook, the purpose of the village planning committees is to &quot;work with the city&#x27;s planning commission to ensure a balance of housing and employment in each village, concentrate development at identified village cores, and to promote the unique character and identity of the villages.&quot; There are 15 urban villages: Ahwatukee Foothills, Alhambra, Camelback East, Central City, Deer Valley, Desert View, Encanto, Estrella, Laveen, Maryvale, North Gateway, North Mountain, Paradise Valley, Rio Vista, and South Mountain.

The urban village of Paradise Valley is distinct from the nearby Town of Paradise Valley. Although the urban village is part of Phoenix, the town is independent.

In addition to the above urban villages, Phoenix has a variety of commonly referred-to regions and districts, such as Downtown, Midtown, Uptown, West Phoenix, North Phoenix, South Phoenix, Biltmore Area, Arcadia, and Sunnyslope.

===Flora and fauna===
While some of the native flora and fauna of the Sonoran Desert can be found within Phoenix city limits, most are found in the suburbs and the undeveloped desert areas that surround the city. Native mammal species include coyote, javelina, bobcat, mountain lion, desert cottontail rabbit, jackrabbit, antelope ground squirrel, mule deer, ringtail, coati, and multiple species of bats, such as the Mexican free-tailed bat and western pipistrelle, that roost in and around the city. There are many species of native birds, including Costa&#x27;s hummingbird, Anna&#x27;s hummingbird, Gambel&#x27;s quail, Gila woodpecker, mourning dove, white-winged dove, the greater roadrunner, the cactus wren, and many species of raptors, including falcons, hawks, owls, vultures (such as the turkey vulture and black vulture), and eagles, including the golden and the bald eagle.

The greater Phoenix region is home to the only thriving feral population of rosy-faced lovebirds in the U.S. This bird is a popular birdcage pet, native to southwestern Africa. Feral birds were first observed living outdoors in 1987, probably escaped or released pets, and by 2010 the Greater Phoenix population had grown to about 950 birds. These lovebirds prefer older neighborhoods where they nest under untrimmed, dead palm tree fronds.

The area is also home to a plethora of native reptile species including the Western diamondback rattlesnake, Sonoran sidewinder, several other types of rattlesnakes, Sonoran coral snake, dozens of species of non-venomous snakes (including the Sonoran gopher snake and the California kingsnake), the gila monster, desert spiny lizard, several types of whiptail lizards, the chuckwalla, desert horned lizard, western banded gecko, Sonora mud turtle, and the desert tortoise. Native amphibian species include the Couch&#x27;s spadefoot toad, Chiricahua leopard frog, and the Sonoran desert toad.

Phoenix and the surrounding areas are also home to a wide variety of native invertebrates including the Arizona bark scorpion, giant desert hairy scorpion, Arizona blond tarantula, Sonoran Desert centipede, tarantula hawk wasp, camel spider, and tailless whip scorpion. Of great concern is the presence of Africanized bees which can be extremely dangerous—even lethal—when provoked.

The Arizona Upland subdivision of the Sonoran Desert (of which Phoenix is a part) has &quot;the most structurally diverse flora in the United States.&quot; One of the most well-known types of succulents, the giant saguaro cactus, is found throughout the city and its neighboring environs. Other native species are the organpipe, barrel, fishhook, senita, prickly pear and cholla cacti; ocotillo; Palo Verde trees and foothill and blue paloverde; California fan palm; agaves; soaptree yucca, Spanish bayonet, desert spoon, and red yucca; ironwood; mesquite; and the creosote bush.

Many non-native plants also thrive in Phoenix including, but not limited to, the date palm, Mexican fan palm, pineapple palm, Afghan pine, Canary Island pine, Mexican fencepost cactus, cardon cactus, acacia, eucalyptus, aloe, bougainvillea, oleander, lantana, bottlebrush, olive, citrus, and red bird of paradise.

=== Climate ===
Phoenix has a hot desert climate (Köppen: &quot;BWh&quot;), typical of the Sonoran Desert, and is the largest city in the Americas in this climatic zone. Phoenix has long, extremely hot summers and short, mild winters. The city is within one of the world&#x27;s sunniest regions, with its sunshine duration comparable to the Sahara region. With 3,872 hours of bright sunshine annually, Phoenix receives the most sunshine of any major city on Earth. Average high temperatures in summer are the hottest of any major city in the United States. On average, there are 111 days annually with a high of at least , including most days from the end of May through late September. Highs top an average of 21 days during the year. On June 26, 1990, the temperature reached an all-time recorded high of . The annual minimum temperature in Phoenix is in the mid-to-low 30s. It rarely drops to or below. Snow is rare. In July 2023, it became the first major city in the US to have an average monthly temperature of over with an average daily mean temperature for the month at , which is also the hottest month ever recorded in the city. That same month the city had an unprecedented streak of 31 days with + highs that lasted from June 30 to July 30. That year the city also had a record 55 days of daily highs topping +, which also made summer of 2023 the hottest on record there, until it was beaten by the summer of 2024 with the hottest ever June at , the third hottest august August at and the 2nd hottest July record at by average daily temperature respectively. That same year in 2024, it also recorded an unprecedented 113 day streak of daily highs topping + that lasted from May 27 to September 16 and ultimately recorded a record 70 days in a single year, ending by October 7. Because extreme heat is so common, nearly all homes in Phoenix have air conditioning, though poorer residents may not be able to afford to repair or operate them when needed.

Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, was ranked seventh for most ozone pollution in the United States according to the American Lung Association. Vehicle emissions are cited as precursors to ozone formation. Phoenix also has high levels of particulate pollution; although, cities in California lead the nation in this hazard. PM2.5 particulate matter, which is a component of diesel engine exhaust, and larger PM10 particles, which can come from dust, can both reach concerning levels in Phoenix. In fact, people, pets, and other animals exposed to high concentrations of PM10 dust particles―primarily from dust storms or from disturbed agricultural or construction sites―are at risk of contracting Valley Fever, a fungal lung infection.

Unlike most desert locations which have drastic fluctuations between day and nighttime temperatures, the urban heat island effect limits Phoenix&#x27;s diurnal temperature variation. As the city has expanded, average summer low temperatures have been steadily rising. Pavement, sidewalks, and buildings store the Sun&#x27;s heat and radiate it at night. The daily normal low remains at or above for an average of 74 days per summer. On July 19, 2023, at the height of an unprecedent heatwave that caused daily highs to top or higher that lasted for 31 days straight, Phoenix set its record for the warmest daily low temperature, at .

The city averages approximately 300 days of sunshine, or over 85% of daylight hours, per year, and receives scant rainfall―the average annual total at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport is . The region&#x27;s trademark dry and sunny weather is interrupted by sporadic Pacific storms in the winter and the arrival of the North American monsoon in the summer. Historically, the monsoon officially started when the average dew point was for three days in a row—typically occurring in early July. To increase monsoon awareness and promote safety, however, the National Weather Service decreed that starting in 2008, June 15 would be the official &quot;first day&quot; of the monsoon, and it would end on September 30. When active, the monsoon raises humidity levels and can cause heavy localized precipitation, flash floods, hail, destructive winds, and dust storms—which can rise to the level of a haboob in some years.
==Demographics==


As of 2020, Phoenix was the fifth most populous city in the United States, with the census bureau placing its population at 1,608,139, edging out Philadelphia with a population of 1,567,872. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, Phoenix had a population of 1,445,632 according to the 2010 United States census, the sixth largest city and still the most populous state capital in the United States. Prior to the Great Recession, in 2006, Phoenix&#x27;s population was 1,512,986, the fifth largest just ahead of Philadelphia.

After leading the U.S. in population growth for over a decade, the sub-prime mortgage crisis, followed by the recession, led to a slowing in the growth of Phoenix. There were approximately 77,000 people added to the population of the Phoenix metropolitan area in 2009, which was down significantly from its peak in 2006 of 162,000. Despite this slowing, Phoenix&#x27;s population grew by 9.4% since the 2000 census (a total of 124,000 people), while the entire Phoenix metropolitan area grew by 28.9% during the same period. This compares with an overall growth rate nationally during the same time frame of 9.7%. Not since 1940–50, when the city had a population of 107,000, had the city gained less than 124,000 in a decade. Phoenix&#x27;s recent growth rate of 9.4% from the 2010 census is the first time it has recorded a growth rate under 24% in a census decade. However, in 2016, Phoenix once again became the fastest growing city in the United States, adding approximately 88 people per day during the preceding year.

The Phoenix Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) (officially known as the Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler MSA), is one of 10 MSAs in Arizona, and was the 11th largest in the United States, with a 2018 U.S. census population estimate of 4,857,962, up from the 2010 census population of 4,192,887. Consisting of both Pinal and Maricopa counties, the MSA accounts for 65.5% of Arizona&#x27;s population. Phoenix only contributed 13% to the total growth rate of the MSA, down significantly from its 33% share during the prior decade. Phoenix is also part of the Arizona Sun Corridor megaregion (MR), which is the tenth most populous of the 11 MRs, and the eighth largest by area. It had the second largest growth by percentage of the MRs (behind only the Gulf Coast MR) between 2000 and 2010.

The population is almost equally split between men and women, with men making up 50.2% of city&#x27;s citizens. The population density is 2,797.8 people per square mile, and the city&#x27;s median age is 32.2 years, with only 10.9 of the population being over 62. 98.5% of Phoenix&#x27;s population lives in households with an average household size of 2.77 people.

There were 514,806 total households, with 64.2% of those households consisting of families: 42.3% married couples, 7% with an unmarried male as head of household, and 14.9% with an unmarried female as head of household. 33.6% of those households have children below the age of 18. Of the 35.8% of non-family households, 27.1% have a householder living alone, almost evenly split between men and women, with women having 13.7% and men occupying 13.5%.

, Phoenix has 590,149 dwelling units, with an occupancy rate of 87.2%. The largest segment of vacancies is in the rental market, where the vacancy rate is 14.9%, and 51% of all vacancies are in rentals. Vacant houses for sale only make up 17.7% of the vacancies, with the rest being split among vacation properties and other various reasons.

The city&#x27;s median household income was $47,866, and the median family income was $54,804. Males had a median income of $32,820 versus $27,466 for females. The city&#x27;s per capita income was $24,110. 21.8% of the population and 17.1% of families were below the poverty line. Of the total population, 31.4% of those under the age of 18 and 10.5% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.

* Two or more races: 3.6%

Phoenix&#x27;s population has historically been predominantly white. From 1890 to 1970, over 90% of the citizens were white. In recent years, this percentage has dropped, reaching 65% in 2010. However, a large part of this decrease can be attributed to new guidelines put out by the U.S. Census Bureau in 1980, when a question regarding Hispanic origin was added to the census questionnaire. This has led to an increasing tendency for some groups to no longer self-identify as white, and instead categorize themselves as &quot;other races&quot;.

20.6% of the population of the city was foreign born in 2010. Of the 1,342,803 residents over five years of age, 63.5% spoke only English, 30.6% spoke Spanish at home, 2.5% spoke another Indo-European language, 2.1% spoke Asian or Islander languages, with the remaining 1.4% speaking other languages. About 15.7% of non-English speakers reported speaking English less than &quot;very well&quot;. The largest national ancestries reported were Mexican (35.9%), German (15.3%), Irish (10.3%), English (9.4%), Black (6.5%), Italian (4.5%), French (2.7%), Polish (2.5%), American Indian (2.2%), and Scottish (2.0%).
Hispanics or Latinos of any race make up 40.8% of the population. Of these the largest groups are at 35.9% Mexican, 0.6% Puerto Rican, 0.5% Guatemalan, 0.3% Salvadoran, 0.3% Cuban.

Phoenix has the largest urban Native American population in Arizona. Phoenix has around 200 Dakota Sioux, approximately 100 Minnesota Chippewas, 100 Kiowas, about 175 Creeks, 100 Choctaws, several hundred Cherokees, several hundred Pueblos, and smaller numbers of Shawnees, Blackfeet, Pawnees, Cheyennes, Iroquois, Tlingit, Yakimas and other Native Americans from far away states.

Hispanics are now the majority in Phoenix. African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans live primarily in the southern portion of Phoenix, below the downtown district.

According to the National Immigration Forum, the majority of Phoenix&#x27;s immigrants are from Latin America: Mexico (196,941), Guatemala (5.093), El Salvador (2,980); Asia: India (10,128), Philippines (5.756), Vietnam (4,698); Africa: Ethiopia (1,157), Liberia (1,089), Sudan (1,067) and Europe: Bosnia and Herzegovina (2.944), Germany (2,847) and Romania (1,658).

According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 66% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, while 26% claimed no religious affiliation. The same study says other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively make up about 7% of the population. In 2010, according to the Association of Religion Data Archives, which conducts religious census each ten years, 39% of those polled in Maricopa county considered themselves a member of a religious group. Of those who expressed a religious affiliation, the area&#x27;s religious composition was reported as 35% Catholic, 22% to Evangelical Protestant denominations, 16% Latter-Day Saints (LDS), 14% to nondenominational congregations, 7% to Mainline Protestant denominations, and 2% Hindu. The remaining 4% belong to other religions, such as Buddhism and Judaism.

While the number of religious adherents increased by 103,000 during the decade, the growth did not keep pace with the county&#x27;s overall population increase of almost three-quarters of million individuals during the same period. The largest aggregate increases were in the LDS (a 58% increase) and Evangelical Protestant churches (14% increase), while all other categories saw their numbers drop slightly or remain static. The Catholic Church had an 8% drop, while mainline Protestant groups saw a 28% decline.

According to the 2022 Point-In-Time Homeless Count, there were 3,096 homeless people in Phoenix.

==Economy==
Phoenix&#x27;s early economy focused on agriculture and natural resources, especially the &quot;5Cs&quot; of copper, cattle, climate, cotton, and citrus. With the opening of the Union Station in 1923, the establishment of the Southern Pacific rail line in 1926, and the creation of Sky Harbor airport in 1928, the city became more easily accessible. The Great Depression affected Phoenix, but Phoenix had a diverse economy and by 1934 the recovery was underway. At the conclusion of World War II, the valley&#x27;s economy surged, as many men who had completed their military training at bases in and around Phoenix returned with their families. The construction industry, spurred on by the city&#x27;s growth, further expanded with the development of Sun City. It became the template for suburban development in post-WWII America, and Sun City became the template for retirement communities when it opened in 1960. The city averaged a four percent annual growth rate over a 40-year period from the mid-1960s to the mid-2000s.

As the national financial crisis of 2007–10 began, construction in Phoenix collapsed and housing prices plunged. Arizona jobs declined by 11.8% from peak to trough; in 2007 Phoenix had 1,918,100 employed individuals, by 2010 that number had shrunk by 226,500 to 1,691,600. By the end of 2015, the employment number in Phoenix had risen to 1.97 million, finally regaining its pre-recession levels, with job growth occurring across the board.

, the Phoenix MSA had a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of just under $243 billion. The top five industries were: real estate ($41.96), finance and insurance ($19.71), manufacturing ($19.91), retail trade ($18.64), and health care ($19.78). Government (including federal, state and local), if it had been a private industry, would have been ranked second on the list, generating $23.37 billion.

In Phoenix, real estate developers face few constraints when planning and developing new projects.

As of January 2016, 10.5% of the workforce were government employees, a high number because the city is both the county seat and state capital. The civilian labor force was 2,200,900, and the unemployment rate stood at 4.6%.

Phoenix is home to four Fortune 500 companies: electronics corporation Avnet, mining company Freeport-McMoRan, retailer PetSmart, and waste hauler Republic Services. Honeywell&#x27;s Aerospace division is headquartered in Phoenix, and the valley hosts many of their avionics and mechanical facilities. Intel has one of their largest sites in the area, employing about 12,000 employees, the second largest Intel location in the country. The city is also home to the headquarters of U-HAUL International, Best Western, and Apollo Group, parent of the University of Phoenix. Southwest is the largest carrier at Phoenix&#x27;s Sky Harbor International Airport. Mesa Air Group, a regional airline group, is headquartered in Phoenix.

The U.S. military has a large presence in Phoenix, with Luke Air Force Base in the western suburbs. The city was severely affected by the effects of the
sub-prime mortgage crash. However, Phoenix has recovered 83% of the jobs lost
due to the recession.

==Arts and culture==

===Performing arts===

The city has many performing arts venues, most of which are in and around downtown Phoenix or Scottsdale. The Phoenix Symphony Hall is home to the Phoenix Symphony Orchestra, the Arizona Opera and Ballet Arizona. The Arizona Opera company also has intimate performances at its new Arizona Opera Center, which opened in March 2013. Another venue is the Orpheum Theatre, home to the Phoenix Opera. Ballet Arizona, in addition to the Symphony Hall, also has performances at the Orpheum Theatre and the Dorrance Theater. Concerts also regularly make stops in the area. The largest downtown performing art venue is the Herberger Theater Center, which houses three performance spaces and is home to two resident companies, the Arizona Theatre Company and the Centre Dance Ensemble. Three other groups also use the facility: Valley Youth Theatre, iTheatre Collaborative and Actors Theater.

Concerts take place at PHX Arena and Comerica Theatre in downtown Phoenix, Ak-Chin Pavilion in Maryvale, Gila River Arena in Glendale, and Gammage Auditorium in Tempe (the last public building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright). Several smaller theaters including Trunk Space, the Mesa Arts Center, The Van Buren, the Crescent Ballroom, Celebrity Theatre, and Modified Arts support regular independent musical and theater performances. Music can also be seen in some of the venues usually reserved for sports, such as the Wells Fargo Arena and State Farm Stadium.

Several television series have been set in Phoenix, including &quot;Alice&quot; (1976–85), the 2000s paranormal drama &quot;Medium&quot;, the 1960–61 syndicated crime drama &quot;The Brothers Brannagan&quot;, and &quot;The New Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; from 1971 to 1974.

===Museums===

The valley has dozens of museums. They include the Phoenix Art Museum, Arizona Capitol Museum, Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art, Arizona Military Museum, Hall of Flame Fire Museum, Phoenix Police Museum, the Pueblo Grande Museum Archaeological Park, Children&#x27;s Museum of Phoenix, Arizona Science Center, and the Heard Museum. In 2010, the Musical Instrument Museum opened their doors, featuring the biggest musical instrument collection in the world. In 2015 the Children&#x27;s Museum of Phoenix was recognized as one of the top three children&#x27;s museums in the United States.

Designed by Alden B. Dow, a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, the Phoenix Art Museum was constructed in a single year, opening in November 1959. The Phoenix Art Museum has the southwest&#x27;s largest collection of visual art, containing more than 17,000 works of contemporary and modern art from around the world. Interactive exhibits can be found in nearby Peoria&#x27;s Challenger Space Center, where individuals learn about space, renewable energies, and meet astronauts.

The Heard Museum has over of gallery, classroom and performance space. Some of the museum&#x27;s signature exhibits include a full Navajo hogan, the Mareen Allen Nichols Collection of 260 pieces of contemporary jewelry, the Barry Goldwater Collection of 437 historic Hopi kachina dolls, and an exhibit on the 19th-century boarding school experiences of Native Americans. The Heard Museum attracts about 250,000 visitors a year.

===Cultural heritage resources===

Arizona has museums, journals, societies, and libraries that serve as sources of important cultural heritage knowledge. They include the Arizona State Archives Historic Photographs Memory Project, which includes over 90,000 images that focus on the unique history of Arizona as a state and territory, the Arizona Historical Society, the &quot;Journal of Arizona History&quot;, and numerous museum databases.

===Fine arts===
The Artlink organization and the galleries downtown launched a First Friday cross-Phoenix gallery opening. In April 2009, artist Janet Echelman installed &quot;Her Secret Is Patience&quot;, a netted sculpture suspended above Phoenix Civic Space Park that makes patterns of desert wind visible. During the day, the -tall sculpture hovers above the park, and at night, the illumination changes color gradually through the seasons.

===Architecture===

Phoenix is the home of a unique architectural tradition and community. Frank Lloyd Wright moved to Phoenix in 1937 and built his winter home, Taliesin West, and the main campus for The Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture. Over the years, Phoenix has attracted notable architects who have made it their home and grown successful practices. These architectural studios embrace the desert climate, and are unconventional in their approach to the practice of design. They include the Paolo Soleri (who created Arcosanti), Al Beadle, Will Bruder, Wendell Burnette, and Blank Studio architectural design studios. Another major force in architectural landscape of the city was Ralph Haver whose firm, Haver &amp; Nunn, designed commercial, industrial and residential structures throughout the valley. Of particular note was his trademark, &quot;Haver Home&quot;, which were affordable contemporary-style tract houses.

===Tourism===
The tourist industry is the longest running of the top industries in Phoenix. Starting with promotions back in the 1920s, the industry has grown into one of the top 10 in the city. With nearly 28,000 hotel rooms in over 175 hotels and resorts Phoenix sees over 19 million visitors each year, most of whom are leisure travelers. Sky Harbor Airport, which serves the Greater Phoenix area, serves about 45 million passengers a year, ranking it among the nation&#x27;s 10 busiest airports.

One of the biggest attractions of the Phoenix area is golf, with over 200 golf courses. In addition to the sites of interest in the city, there are many attractions near Phoenix, such as Agua Fria National Monument, Arcosanti, Casa Grande Ruins National Monument, Lost Dutchman State Park, Montezuma&#x27;s Castle, Montezuma&#x27;s Well, and Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument.

===Other attractions and annual events===

Due to its natural environment and climate, Phoenix has a number of outdoor attractions and recreational activities. The Phoenix Zoo is the largest privately owned nonprofit zoo in the United States. Since opening in 1962, it has developed an international reputation for its efforts on animal conservation, including breeding and reintroducing endangered species into the wild. The adjacent Phoenix Botanical Gardens, opened in 1939, are acclaimed worldwide for their art and flora exhibits and educational programs, featuring the largest collection of arid plants in the U.S. South Mountain Park, the largest municipal park in the U.S., is also the highest desert mountain preserve in the world.

Other popular sites in the city are Japanese Friendship Garden, Historic Heritage Square, Phoenix Mountains Park, Pueblo Grande Museum, Tovrea Castle, Camelback Mountain, Hole in the Rock, Mystery Castle, St. Mary&#x27;s Basilica, Taliesin West, and the Wrigley Mansion.

===Cuisine===
Phoenix is also renowned for its Mexican food, thanks to its large Hispanic population and its proximity to Mexico. Some of Phoenix&#x27;s restaurants have a long history. The Stockyards steakhouse dates to 1947, while Monti&#x27;s La Casa Vieja (Spanish for &quot;The Old House&quot;) was in operation as a restaurant since the 1890s, but closed its doors November 17, 2014. Macayo&#x27;s (a Mexican restaurant chain) was established in Phoenix in 1946, and other major Mexican restaurants include Garcia&#x27;s (1956) and Manuel&#x27;s (1964). The population boom has brought people from all over the nation, and to a lesser extent from other countries, and has since influenced the local cuisine. Phoenix boasts cuisines from all over the world, such as barbecue, Cajun/Creole, Greek, Hawaiian, Irish, Japanese, Italian, fusion, Persian, Indian (South Asian), Korean, Spanish, Thai, Chinese, southwestern, Tex-Mex, Vietnamese, Brazilian, and French.

The first McDonald&#x27;s franchise was sold by the McDonald brothers to a Phoenix entrepreneur in 1952. Neil Fox paid $1,000 for the rights to open an establishment based on the McDonald brothers&#x27; restaurant. The hamburger stand opened in 1953 on the southwest corner of Central Avenue and Indian School Road, on the growing north side of Phoenix, and was the first location to sport the now internationally known golden arches, which were initially twice the height of the building. Three other franchise locations opened that year, two years before Ray Kroc purchased McDonald&#x27;s.

==Sports==
===Major league===
Phoenix is home to several professional sports franchises, and until recently, was one of only 13 U.S. metropolitan areas to have representatives of all four major professional sports leagues, although only one of these teams actually carry the city name and two of them play within the city limits.

The Phoenix Suns were the first major sports team in Phoenix, being granted a National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise in 1968. They lost the 1976 NBA Championship to the Boston Celtics in 6 games. They had originally played at the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum before moving to America West Arena (now PHX Arena) in 1992. The year following their move to the new arena, the Suns made it to the NBA Finals for the second time in franchise history, losing to Michael Jordan&#x27;s Chicago Bulls, four games to two. The U.S. Airways Center hosted both the 1995 and the 2009 NBA All-Star Games. They also lost the 2021 NBA Finals in six games to the Milwaukee Bucks.

The Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball began play as an expansion team in 1998. The team has played all of its home games in the same downtown park, now known as Chase Field. It is the second highest stadium in the U.S. (after Coors Field in Denver), and is known for its swimming pool beyond the outfield fence. In 2001, the Diamondbacks defeated the New York Yankees four games to three in the World Series, becoming the city&#x27;s first professional sports franchise to win a national championship while in Arizona. The win was also the fastest an expansion team had ever won the World Series, surpassing the old mark of the Florida Marlins of five years, set in 1997.
The Arizona Cardinals are the oldest continuously run professional football franchise in the nation. Founded in 1898 in Chicago, they moved to Phoenix from St. Louis, Missouri in 1988 and play in the Western Division of the National Football League&#x27;s National Football Conference. Upon their move to Phoenix, the Cardinals played their home games at Sun Devil Stadium on the campus of Arizona State University in nearby Tempe. In 2006, they moved to the new State Farm Stadium in suburban Glendale. Since moving to Phoenix, the Cardinals have made one championship appearance, Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, where they lost 27–23 to the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Sun Devil Stadium held Super Bowl XXX in 1996. State Farm Stadium hosted Super Bowl XLII in 2008, Super Bowl XLIX in 2015, and Super Bowl LVII in 2023 .

The Arizona Coyotes of the National Hockey League, formerly the original Winnipeg Jets, moved to the area in 1996. They originally played their home games at America West Arena in downtown Phoenix before moving in December 2003 to the Glendale Arena (now named the Desert Diamond Arena) in Glendale. In 2022, the Coyotes lost their lease in Glendale and moved to the then newly opened Mullett Arena on the campus of Arizona State University. They were working with the city of Tempe to create a new entertainment district. However, after residents of Tempe rejected a bond initiative to pay for a new stadium, the Coyotes were deactivated, and the team&#x27;s assets were moved to Salt Lake City, Utah. The Coyotes have a five-year window to get a new arena in the area where they will be reactivated as an expansion franchise, otherwise the league will cease all operations for the franchise.

Phoenix Rising FC is a professional soccer team that competes in the USL Championship, the second tier of US professional soccer. Phoenix Rising FC started as Arizona United SC in 2014 and played at the Peoria Sports Complex and Scottsdale Stadium from 2014 to 2016. Rebranded in 2017 as Phoenix Rising FC, the team started play from 2017 to 2020 at the Casino Arizona Field. In 2021, the club moved to a new home, the Phoenix Rising Soccer Complex at Wild Horse Pass, which was located inside the Gila River Indian Community near Chandler and played there throughout the 2022 season. The club began play in 2023 at the newly constructed Phoenix Rising Soccer Stadium, which is modular in design and located in an area north of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.

In 2018, the now-defunct Alliance of American Football announced the league&#x27;s Phoenix franchise, the Arizona Hotshots, would begin playing in 2019.

===Other sports===
The Phoenix area hosts two annual college football bowl games: the Fiesta Bowl, played at State Farm Stadium, and the Rate Bowl (which has undergone several name changes), held at Chase Field.

Phoenix has an indoor football team, the Arizona Rattlers of the Indoor Football League. Their games are played at the Desert Diamond Arena. They played in the Arena Football League from 1992 to 2016 and had won five AFL championships before leaving the league.

In 1997, the Phoenix Mercury were one of the original eight teams to launch the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA). They also play at PHX Arena. They have won the WNBA championship three times: first in 2007 when they defeated the Detroit Shock, again in 2009 when they defeated the Indiana Fever, and in 2014 when they swept the Chicago Sky.

The Greater Phoenix area is home to the Cactus League, one of two spring training leagues for Major League Baseball. With the move by the Colorado Rockies and the Diamondbacks to their new facility in the Salt River Indian Community, the league is entirely based in the Greater Phoenix area. With the Cincinnati Reds&#x27; move to Goodyear, half of MLB&#x27;s 30 teams are now included in the Cactus League.

Phoenix International Raceway was built in 1964 with a oval, with a one-of-a-kind design, as well as a road course. It hosts several NASCAR events per season, and the annual Fall NASCAR weekend, which includes events from four different NASCAR classes, is a huge event. Wild Horse Pass Motorsports Park (formerly Firebird International Raceway) hosts NHRA events in the Phoenix metropolitan area.

The city also hosts several major professional golf events, including the LPGA&#x27;s Founder&#x27;s Cup and, since 1932, The Phoenix Open of the PGA Tour.

==Parks and recreation==

Phoenix is home to a large number of parks and recreation areas. The city of Phoenix includes national parks, Maricopa County parks and city parks. Tonto National Forest forms part of the city&#x27;s northeast boundary, while the county has the largest park system in the country.

The city park system established to preserve the desert landscape in areas that would otherwise have succumbed to development includes South Mountain Park, the world&#x27;s largest municipal park with . The system&#x27;s 182 parks contain over , making it the largest municipal park system in the country. The park system has facilities for hiking, camping, swimming, horseback riding, cycling, and climbing. Some of the system&#x27;s other notable parks include Camelback Mountain, Encanto Park, Phoenix Mountains Preserve and Sunnyslope Mountain, also known as &quot;S&quot; Mountain.

Papago Park in east Phoenix is home to both the Desert Botanical Garden and the Phoenix Zoo, in addition to several golf courses and the Hole-in-the-Rock geological formation. The Desert Botanical Garden, which opened in 1939, is one of the few public gardens in the country dedicated to desert plants and displays desert plant life from all over the world. The Phoenix Zoo is the largest privately owned non-profit zoo in the United States and is internationally known for its programs devoted to saving endangered species.

==Government==
In 1913, Phoenix adopted a new form of government, switching from the mayor-council system to the council-manager system, making it one of the first cities in the United States with this form of city government, where a city manager supervises all city departments and executes the policies adopted by the council. Today, Phoenix represents the largest municipal government of this type in the country.

The city council consists of a mayor and eight city council members. While the mayor is elected in a citywide election, Phoenix City Council members are elected by votes only in the districts they represent, with both the Mayor and the Council members serving four-year terms. The mayor of Phoenix is Kate Gallego. The mayor and city council members each have equal voting power in regards to setting city policy and passing rules and regulations. Sunshine Review gave the city&#x27;s website a Sunny Award for its transparency efforts.

===State government facilities===

As the capital of Arizona, Phoenix houses the state legislature, along with numerous state government agencies, many of which are in the State Capitol district immediately west of downtown. The Arizona Department of Juvenile Corrections operates the Adobe Mountain and Black Canyon Schools in Phoenix. Another major state government facility is the Arizona State Hospital, operated by the Arizona Department of Health Services. This is a mental health center and is the only medical facility run by the state government. The headquarters of numerous Arizona state government agencies are in Phoenix, with many in the State Capitol district.

===Federal government facilities===
The Federal Bureau of Prisons operates the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Phoenix, which is within the city limits, near its northern boundary.

The Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor U.S. Courthouse, the U.S. District Court of Arizona, is on Washington Street downtown. It is named in honor of retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, who was raised in Arizona.

The Federal Building is at the intersection of Van Buren Street and First Avenue downtown. It contains various federal field offices and the local division of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. This building formerly housed the U.S. District Court offices and courtrooms, but these were moved in 2001 to the new Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor U.S. Courthouse. Before the construction of this building in 1961, federal government offices were housed in the historic U.S. Post Office on Central Avenue, completed in the 1930s.

===Crime===

By the 1960s, crime was a major problem in Phoenix, and by the 1970s, crime continued to increase in the city at a faster rate than almost anywhere else in the country. It was during this time frame when an incident occurred in Phoenix which would have national implications. On March 16, 1963, Ernesto Miranda was arrested and charged with rape. The subsequent Supreme Court ruling on June 13, 1966, &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot;, has led to practice in the United States of issuing a Miranda Warning to all suspected criminals.

With Phoenix&#x27;s rapid growth, one of the prime areas of criminal activity was land fraud. The practice became so widespread that newspapers would refer to Phoenix as &quot;the Tainted Desert&quot;. These land frauds led to one of the more infamous murders in the history of the valley, when &quot;Arizona Republic&quot; writer Don Bolles was murdered by a car bomb in 1976. It was believed his investigative reporting on organized crime and land fraud in Phoenix made him a target.
Bolles was the only reporter from a major U.S. newspaper to be murdered on U.S. soil due to his coverage of a story. Max Dunlap was convicted of first-degree murder in the case.

Street gangs and the drug trade had turned into public safety issues by the 1980s, and the crime rate in Phoenix continued to grow.
After seeing a peak in the early and mid-1990s, the city has seen a general decrease in crime rates. The Maricopa County Jail system is the fourth-largest in the country. The violent crime rate peaked in 1993 at 1146 crimes per 100,000 people, while the property crime rate peaked a few years earlier, in 1989, at 9,966 crimes per 100,000.

In 2001 and 2002, Phoenix ranked first in the nation in vehicle thefts, with over 22,000 and 25,000 cars stolen each year respectively. It has declined every year since then, eventually falling to 7,200 in 2014, a drop of almost 70% during that timeframe. The Phoenix MSA has dropped to 70th in the nation in terms of car thefts in 2012.

On August 2, 2022, a mass shooting took place in the Deer Valley area of Phoenix. The shooter killed two bystanders and injured five others before committing suicide.

=== Politics ===

Long a swing region in Arizona, Phoenix&#x27;s city limits have increasingly trended toward the Democratic Party in recent years, leading a shift seen across the rest of the state. Margaret Hance was elected the city&#x27;s first female mayor in 1975.

==Education==

33 school districts provide public education in the Phoenix area. This is a legacy of numerous annexations over the years; many of the school districts existed before their territories became part of Phoenix.

There are 21 elementary school districts, which have over 215 elementary schools, paired with four high school districts with 31 high schools serving Phoenix. Three of the high school districts (Glendale Union, Tempe Union, and Tolleson Union) only partially serve Phoenix. With over 27,000 students, and spread over , Phoenix Union High School District is one of the largest high school districts in the country, containing 16 schools and nearly 3,000 employees. In addition, there are four unified districts, which cover grades K–12, which add an additional 58 elementary schools and four high schools to Phoenix&#x27;s educational system. Of those four, only the Paradise Valley district completely serves Phoenix. Phoenix is also served by a growing number of charter schools, with well over 100 operating in the city.

===Post-secondary education===
Arizona State University (ASU) is the region&#x27;s largest institution of higher education. Primarily based in Tempe, it has a significant presence at the Arizona State University Downtown Phoenix campus. The campus features programs from ten of ASU&#x27;s colleges, including the primary locations for the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, Watts College of Public Service &amp; Community Solutions, and Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor College of Law. Over 10,000 students are enrolled at ASU&#x27;s Downtown Phoenix campus.

The University of Arizona College of Medicine – Phoenix is also located in downtown Phoenix, as well as a satellite Phoenix Biomedical Campus of Northern Arizona University.

The Maricopa County Community College District includes ten community colleges and two skills centers throughout Maricopa County, providing adult education and job training. Phoenix College, part of the district, was founded in 1920 and is the oldest community college in Arizona and one of the oldest in the country.

The city is also home to many other institutions of higher learning such as the Phoenix Seminary, a Protestant seminary that imparts degree in biblical studies, Christian theology, church history and counseling. Notable institutions include: Barrow Neurological Institute, the world&#x27;s largest neurological disease treatment and research institution; Grand Canyon University, a private Christian university initially founded in 1949 as a non-profit school, it now operates as a for-profit institution; the University of Phoenix, also a for-profit college, is based out of the city.

==Media==

Phoenix&#x27;s first newspaper was the weekly &quot;Salt River Valley Herald&quot;, established in 1878, which would change its name the following year to the &quot;Phoenix Herald&quot;. The paper would go through several additional name changes in its early years before finally settling on the &quot;Phoenix Herald&quot;, which still exists today in an online form. Today, the city is served by one major daily newspaper: &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot;, which along with its online entity, &quot;azcentral.com&quot;, serves the greater metropolitan area. The &quot;Jewish News of Greater Phoenix&quot; is an independent weekly newspaper established in 1948. In addition, the city is also served by numerous free neighborhood papers and alternative weeklies such as the &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot;&#x27; the &quot;East Valley Tribune&quot;, which primarily serves the cities of the East Valley; and Arizona State University&#x27;s &quot;The State Press&quot;.

The Phoenix metro area is served by many local television stations and is the largest designated market area (DMA) in the Southwest, and the 12th largest in the U.S., with over 1.8 million homes (1.6% of the total U.S.).

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
====Air====

Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport , one of the ten busiest airports in the United States, serves over 110,000 people on over 1,000 flights per day. Centrally located in the metro area near several major freeway interchanges east of downtown Phoenix, the airport serves more than 100 cities with non-stop flights.

Air Canada, Air France, British Airways, Condor, Volaris, and WestJet are among several international carriers as well as American carrier American Airlines (which maintains a hub at the airport) that provide flights to destinations such as Canada, Costa Rica, Mexico, and London. In addition to American, other domestic carriers include Alaska Airlines, Delta, Frontier, Hawaiian, JetBlue, Southwest, Spirit, Sun Country, and United.

The Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport in neighboring Mesa also serves the area&#x27;s commercial air traffic. It was converted from Williams Air Force Base, which closed in 1993. The airport has recently received substantial commercial service with Allegiant Air opening a hub operation at the airport with non-stop service to over a dozen destinations.

Smaller airports that primarily handle private and corporate jets include Phoenix Deer Valley Airport, in the Deer Valley district of north Phoenix, and Scottsdale Airport, just east of the Phoenix/Scottsdale border. There are also other municipal airports including Glendale Municipal Airport, Falcon Field Airport in Mesa, and Phoenix Goodyear Airport.

====Rail and bus====

Amtrak served Phoenix Union Station until 1996 when the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) proposed abandoning the route between Yuma, Arizona, and Phoenix. Amtrak rerouted trains to Maricopa, south of downtown Phoenix, where passengers can board the &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; (Los Angeles-San Antonio-Chicago) and &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; (Los Angeles-New Orleans). UP retained the trackage and the station remains. In 2021, Amtrak developed a plan to bring rail service back to Phoenix with connections to Tucson and Los Angeles. This service is supported by the Bipartisan infrastructure bill and could take several years for service to be implemented.

Amtrak Thruway buses connect Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport to Flagstaff for connection with the Los Angeles-Chicago &quot;Southwest Chief&quot;. Phoenix is also served by Greyhound bus service, which stops at 24th Street near the airport.
Valley Metro provides public transportation throughout the metropolitan area, with its trains, buses, and a ride-share program. 3.38% of workers commute by public transit. Valley Metro&#x27;s light rail project, called Valley Metro Rail, through north-central Phoenix, downtown, and eastward through Tempe and Mesa, opened December 27, 2008. Future rail segments of more than are planned to open by 2030.

====Roads and freeways====
Phoenix auto traffic depends on both freeways and surface streets. Freeways fall under the auspices of the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT). Phoenix ranks first in the nation in the quality of its urban freeways, and the state as a whole ranks first in the nation in the quality of bridges. While being the fifth most populous city in the nation, Phoenix&#x27;s freeways do not suffer from the same type of congestion seen in other large cities. In fact, in a recent study, there is not a single stretch of freeway in Phoenix ranked in the 100 worst freeways for either congestion or unreliability.
Part of the reason for this is the extensive freeway system in the city, due to most of that system being funded by local, rather than federal funds, through a half-cent general sales tax measure approved by voters in 1985. Another offshoot of this local funding is that Phoenix is the largest city in the United States to have at least two Interstate Highways, but no three-digit interstates.

, the metropolitan area of Phoenix contains one of the nation&#x27;s largest and fastest growing freeway systems, consisting of over . The freeway system is a mix of Interstate, U.S., and state highways which include Interstate 10, Interstate 17, US 60, Loop 101, Loop 202, SR 51, SR 143, and Loop 303. There are still major additions to routes 101, 202 and 303 underway, as well as several other smaller projects around the valley. State Routes 87, 85, and 74 connect Phoenix with other areas of the Valley and Arizona.

The street system in Phoenix (and some of its suburbs) is laid out in a grid system, with most roads oriented either north–south or east–west, and the zero point of the grid being the intersection of Central Avenue and Washington Street. The one notable exception to this is the diagonal Grand Avenue, which runs northwest–southeast. The original plan was for the east–west streets to be named after U.S. Presidents, with the north–south streets named after Native Americans; but the north–south streets were quickly changed to numbers, with numbered Avenues running to the west of Central, and numbered Streets to its east. Major arterial streets are spaced apart, divided into smaller blocks approximately every . For example, Scottsdale Road, being the 7200 block east, lies to the east of Central Avenue (72 / 8).

====Cycling====
The Maricopa Association of Governments has a bicycle advisory committee working to improve conditions for bicycling on city streets and off-road paths.

===Utilities===

Being in the desert, Phoenix relies on a water supply delivered to the city via a system of canals which divert water from the region&#x27;s rivers and lakes, with the largest portion of the city&#x27;s water coming from the Colorado River through the Central Arizona Project&#x27;s canal. The city&#x27;s electrical needs are served primarily by Arizona Public Service, although some customers receive their electricity from the Salt River Project (SRP). The main sources of electrical generation are nuclear and coal power plants. Arizona is home to the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, the largest nuclear-generating facility in the United States. SRP is also the largest water provider in Phoenix.

===Health care===
In 2011 (the last year for which information is available), Phoenix had a slightly younger population than the country as a whole. While the United States had 13.3% of its population over the age of 65, Phoenix&#x27;s percentage stood significantly lower, at 8.1%. Phoenix&#x27;s percentage of 18.8% in the next age group, 45–64 was also a great deal lower than the national average of 26.6%. This results in 73% of Phoenix&#x27;s population being 44 or younger, as compared to the national percentage of 60.

In 2010 (the last year for nationally reported figures), Phoenix was at or below national levels for most reportable diseases, with the exception of both hepatitis A and B, where they were slightly over the national average (0.8 and 1.8 to 0.5 and 1.1%, respectively).
In most major categories, Phoenix had a lower incidence of death than the rest of the nation. Only deaths due to Alzheimer&#x27;s (29.7 to 27.2 deaths per 100,000) and pre-natal conditions (5.3 to 3.8 deaths per 100,000) were slightly above the national average. Deaths due to HIV and liver disease were exactly at the national average of 2.5 and 10.8 respectively. However, in several major categories, Phoenix had significantly lower indices of death: deaths by cancer stood at only 57% (106) of the national average of 184.6 deaths per 100,000; deaths due to heart disease, 56.1% of the national rate of 249.8 per 100,000. Cancer and heart disease were the two top causes of death in the country.

Low-weight births (7.5%) were below the national average of 8.1%, yet infant mortality (7.2‰ [per thousand]) was higher than the rest of the U.S. (6.1‰). Births to teen mothers were significantly higher than the rest of the country, sitting at 12.2% as compared to 8.4% nationally.

The Phoenix metropolitan area is serviced by 56 hospitals and medical centers. The Mayo Clinic, a not-for-profit medical practice and medical research group based in Rochester, Minnesota. Phoenix is one of two other locations with Mayo Clinic campuses (the other being Jacksonville, Florida). It is the first and largest integrated not-for-profit medical group practice in the world; Mayo Clinic has been near or at the top of the U.S. News &amp; World Report List of &quot;Best Hospitals&quot; for more than 20 years.

St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital and Medical Center is part of Dignity Health (formerly Catholic Healthcare West), one of the largest healthcare systems in the western United States. St. Joseph&#x27;s is a not-for-profit hospital with special advocacy for the poor and underserved. John C. Lincoln North Mountain Hospital is a general medical and surgical hospital, which performed nearly at the level of nationally ranked U.S. News Best Hospitals in four adult specialties. The Phoenix Children&#x27;s Hospital is nationally ranked in five pediatric specialties according to U.S. News &amp; World Report. It is a 425-bed children&#x27;s teaching hospital. Arizona Heart Institute, opened in 1971, is known internationally as one of the first freestanding outpatient clinics dedicated exclusively to cardiovascular health.

Banner Health is a non-profit health system in the United States, based in Phoenix. It operates 23 hospitals as well as specialized facilities. The health system is the largest employer in Arizona, employing more than 43,440. Banner Health was created in 1999 through a merger of Lutheran Health Systems, based in North Dakota, and Samaritan Health System, based in Phoenix. Of the top ten rated hospitals in the city (top 12 in the state), four are Banner hospitals.

Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) at St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital and Medical Center is the world&#x27;s largest dedicated neurosurgical center and a leader in neurosurgical training, research, and patient care. More operative neurosurgical procedures take place at BNI than at any other institution in the United States.

==Sister cities==

With the creation of the Phoenix Sister Cities (PSC) organization in 1972, Phoenix became a member of the international Sister City movement. They filed for Articles of Incorporation in 1975, and entered into their first Sister City agreement in 1976 with Hermosillo, Mexico. The organization&#x27;s mission statement states their purpose is to &quot;foster relationships between the people of Phoenix and our Sister Cities around the world to promote friendship, peace and prosperity.&quot;

Phoenix has twelve sister cities. Phoenix and Prague have shared a Capital Cities relationship since May 1991, which was expanded to Sister City Status in 2013.

<text>The phoenix is a legendary immortal bird that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again. Originating in Greek mythology, it has analogs in many cultures, such as Egyptian and Persian mythology. Associated with the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by rising from the ashes of its predecessor. Some legends say it dies in a show of flames and combustion, while others say that it simply dies and decomposes before being born again. In the &quot;Motif-Index of Folk-Literature&quot;, a tool used by folklorists, the phoenix is classified as motif B32.

The origin of the phoenix has been attributed to Ancient Egypt by Herodotus and later 19th-century scholars, but other scholars think the Egyptian texts may have been influenced by classical folklore. Over time, the phoenix motif spread and gained a variety of new associations; Herodotus, Lucan, Pliny the Elder, Pope Clement I, Lactantius, Ovid, and Isidore of Seville are among those who have contributed to the retelling and transmission of the phoenix motif. Over time, extending beyond its origins, the phoenix could variously &quot;symbolize renewal in general as well as the sun, time, the Roman Empire, metempsychosis, consecration, resurrection, life in the heavenly Paradise, Christ, Mary, virginity, the exceptional man, and certain aspects of Christian life&quot;. Some scholars have claimed that the poem &quot;De ave phoenice&quot; may present the mythological phoenix motif as a symbol of Christ&#x27;s resurrection.

==Etymology==
The modern English word &quot;phoenix&quot; entered the English language from Latin, later reinforced by French. The word first entered the English language by way of a borrowing of Latin &quot;phoenīx&quot; into Old English (&quot;fenix&quot;). This borrowing was later reinforced by French influence, which had also borrowed the Latin noun. In time, the word developed specialized use in the English language: For example, the term could refer to an &quot;excellent person&quot; (12th century), a variety of heraldic emblem (15th century), and the name of a constellation (17th century).

The Latin word comes from Greek (&quot;phoinix&quot;). The Greek word is first attested in the Mycenaean Greek &quot;po-ni-ke&quot;, which probably meant &quot;griffin&quot;, though it might have meant &quot;palm tree&quot;. That word is probably a borrowing from a West Semitic word for madder, a red dye made from &quot;Rubia tinctorum&quot;. The word &quot;Phoenician&quot; appears to be from the same root, meaning &quot;those who work with red dyes&quot;. So &quot;phoenix&quot; also mean &quot;the Phoenician bird&quot; or &quot;the purplish-red bird&quot;.

==Early texts==
Apart from the Linear B mention above from Mycenaean Greece, the earliest clear mention of the phoenix in ancient Greek literature occurs in a fragment of the &quot;Precepts of Chiron&quot;, attributed to 8th-century BC Greek poet Hesiod. In the fragment, the wise centaur Chiron tells a young hero Achilles the following, describing the phoenix&#x27;s lifetime as 972 times the length of a long-lived human&#x27;s:
==Disputed origins==
Classical discourse on the subject of the phoenix attributes a potential origin of the phoenix to Ancient Egypt. Herodotus, writing in the 5th century BC, provides the following account of the phoenix:

In the 19th century, scholastic suspicions appeared to be confirmed by the discovery that Egyptians in Heliopolis had venerated the Bennu, a solar bird similar in some respects to the Greek phoenix. However, the Egyptian sources regarding the bennu are often problematic and open to a variety of interpretations. Some of these sources may have actually been influenced by Greek notions of the phoenix, rather than the other way around.

==Depictions==
The phoenix is sometimes pictured in ancient and medieval literature and medieval art as endowed with a halo, which emphasizes the bird&#x27;s connection with the Sun. In the oldest images of phoenixes on record these nimbuses often have seven rays, like Helios (the Greek personification of the Sun). Pliny the Elder also describes the bird as having a crest of feathers on its head, and Ezekiel the Dramatist compared it to a rooster.

The phoenix came to be associated with specific colors over time. Although the phoenix was generally believed to be colorful and vibrant, sources provide no clear consensus about its coloration. Tacitus says that its color made it stand out from all other birds. Some said that the bird had peacock-like coloring, and Herodotus&#x27;s claim of the Phoenix being red and yellow is popular in many versions of the story on record. Ezekiel the Tragedian declared that the phoenix had red legs and striking yellow eyes, but Lactantius said that its eyes were blue like sapphires and that its legs were covered in yellow-gold scales with rose-colored talons.

Herodotus, Pliny, Solinus, and Philostratus describe the phoenix as similar in size to an eagle, but Lactantius and Ezekiel the Dramatist both claim that the phoenix was larger, with Lactantius declaring that it was even larger than an ostrich.

According to Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;,

According to Claudian&#x27;s poem &quot;The Phoenix&quot;,


== Appearances ==
According to Pliny the Elder, a senator Manilius (Marcus Manilius?) had written that the phoenix appeared at the end of each Great Year, which he wrote of &quot;in the consulship of Gnaeus Cornelius and Publius Licinius&quot;, that is, in 96 BC, that a cycle was 540 years, and that it was 215 into the cycle (i.e. it began in 311 BC). Another of Pliny&#x27;s sources, Cornelius Valerianus, is cited for an appearance of the phoenix in 36 AD &quot;in the consulship of Quintus Plautius and Sextus Papinius&quot;. Pliny states that a purported phoenix seen in Egypt in 47 AD was brought to the capital and exhibited in the Comitium in time for the 800th anniversary of the foundation of Rome by Romulus, though he added that &quot;nobody would doubt that this phoenix was a fabrication&quot;.

A second recording of the phoenix was made by Tacitus, who said that the phoenix had appeared instead in 34 AD &quot;in the consulship of Paulus Fabius and Lucius Vitellius&quot; and that the cycle was either 500 years or 1461 years (which was the Great Year based on the Egyptian Sothic cycle), and that it had previously been seen in the reigns first of Sesosis, then of Amasis, and finally of Ptolemy (third of the Macedonian dynasty). A third recording was made by Cassius Dio, who also said that the phoenix was seen in the consulship of Quintus Plautus and Sextus Papinius.

==Diffusion in later culture==

In time, the motif and concept of the phoenix extended from its origins in ancient Greek folklore. For example, the classical motif of the phoenix continues into the Gnostic manuscript &quot;On the Origin of the World&quot; from the Nag Hammadi Library collection in Egypt generally dated to the 4th century:

The anonymous 10th century Old English &quot;Exeter Book&quot; contains a 677-line 9th-century alliterative poem consisting of a paraphrase and abbreviation of Lactantius, followed by an explication of the Phoenix as an allegory for the resurrection of Christ.
In the 14th century, Italian poet Dante Alighieri refers to the phoenix in Canto XXIV of the &quot;Divine Comedy&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Inferno&quot;:
In the 17th-century play &quot;Henry VIII&quot; by English playwrights William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, Archbishop Cranmer says in Act V, Scene v in reference to Elizabeth (who was to become Queen Elizabeth I):

In the 19th-century novel &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; by Thomas Carlyle, Diogenes Teufelsdröckh uses the phoenix as a metaphor for the cyclical pattern of history, remarking upon the &quot;burning of a World-Phoenix&quot; and the &quot;Palingenesia, or Newbirth of Society&quot; from its ashes:

Phoenixes are present and relatively common in European heraldry, which developed during the High Middle Ages. They most often appear as crests, and more rarely as charges. The heraldic phoenix is depicted as the head, chest and wings of an eagle rising from a fire; the entire creature is never depicted.

==Analogues==
Scholars have observed analogues to the phoenix in a variety of cultures. These analogues include the Hindu &quot;garuda&quot; (गरुड) and &quot;bherunda&quot; (भेरुण्ड), the Slavic firebird (жар-птица) and &quot;Raróg&quot;, the Persian &quot;simorgh&quot; (سیمرغ), the Georgian &quot;paskunji&quot; (ფასკუნჯი), the Arabian &quot;anqa&quot; (عنقاء), the Turkish Konrul, also called &quot;Zümrüdü Anka&quot; (&quot;emerald anqa&quot;), the Tibetan &quot;Me byi karmo&quot;, the Chinese &quot;Fenghuang&quot; (鳳凰) and Zhuque (朱雀). These perceived analogues are sometimes included as part of the Motif-Index of Folk-Literature &quot;phoenix&quot; motif (B32).

== In popular culture ==
There are many works of modern literature make reference to the phoenix. Examples include:
*In Neil Gaiman&#x27;s short story &quot;Sunbird&quot;, a party of Epicureans finally answer the question of what happens when a Phoenix is roasted and eaten; you burst into flames, and &#x27;the years burn off you&#x27;. This can kill those who are inexperienced, but those who have swallowed fire and practised with glow-worms can achieve eternal youth.
*Fawkes, a male phoenix described as Professor Dumbledore&#x27;s loyal pet in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series.
*In Terry Pratchett&#x27;s novel &quot;Carpe Jugulum&quot;, the search for the phoenix forms an important side plot.
*In Eiichiro Oda&#x27;s manga and anime series One Piece, &quot;Phoenix Marco&quot; is a prominent character (a member of the Whitebeard Pirates) who possesses the Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit called the Tori Tori no Mi, Model: Phoenix, which allows him to transform into a phoenix.
*The Phoenix is portrayed as a powerful cosmic entity in the Marvel Comics mythology. Through the avatar of Jean Grey and its other beholders, the Phoenix Force is most oftentimes linked to X-Men comics storylines.

<text>Phoenix is a minor constellation in the southern sky. Named after the mythical phoenix, it was first depicted on a celestial atlas by Johann Bayer in his 1603 &quot;Uranometria&quot;. The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted the brighter stars and gave their Bayer designations in 1756. The constellation stretches from roughly −39° to −57° declination, and from 23.5h to 2.5h of right ascension. The constellations Phoenix, Grus, Pavo and Tucana, are known as the Southern Birds.

The brightest star, Alpha Phoenicis, is named Ankaa, an Arabic word meaning &#x27;the Phoenix&#x27;. It is an orange giant of apparent magnitude 2.4. Next is Beta Phoenicis, actually a binary system composed of two yellow giants with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.3. Nu Phoenicis has a dust disk, while the constellation has ten star systems with known planets and the recently discovered galaxy clusters El Gordo and the Phoenix Cluster—located 7.2 and 5.7 billion light years away respectively, two of the largest objects in the visible universe. Phoenix is the radiant of two annual meteor showers: the Phoenicids in December, and the July Phoenicids.

==History==

Phoenix was the largest of the 12 constellations established by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. It first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer&#x27;s &quot;Uranometria&quot; of 1603. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalog the same year under the Dutch name &quot;Den voghel Fenicx&quot;, &quot;The Bird Phoenix&quot;, symbolising the phoenix of classical mythology. One name of the brightest star Alpha Phoenicis—Ankaa—is derived from the , and was coined sometime after 1800 in relation to the constellation.

Celestial historian Richard Allen noted that unlike the other constellations introduced by Plancius and La Caille, Phoenix has actual precedent in ancient astronomy, as the Arabs saw this formation as representing young ostriches, &quot;Al Ri&#x27;āl&quot;, or as a griffin or eagle. In addition, the same group of stars was sometimes imagined by the Arabs as a boat, &quot;Al Zaurak&quot;, on the nearby river Eridanus. He observed, &quot;the introduction of a Phoenix into modern astronomy was, in a measure, by adoption rather than by invention.&quot;

The Chinese incorporated Phoenix&#x27;s brightest star, Ankaa (Alpha Phoenicis), and stars from the adjacent constellation Sculptor to depict &quot;Bakui&quot;, a net for catching birds. Phoenix and the neighbouring constellation of Grus together were seen by Julius Schiller as portraying Aaron the High Priest. These two constellations, along with nearby Pavo and Tucana, are called the Southern Birds.

==Characteristics==
Phoenix is a small constellation bordered by Fornax and Sculptor to the north, Grus to the west, Tucana to the south, touching on the corner of Hydrus to the south, and Eridanus to the east and southeast. The bright star Achernar is nearby. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &quot;Phe&quot;. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 10 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between −39.31° and −57.84°. This means it remains below the horizon to anyone living north of the 40th parallel in the Northern Hemisphere, and remains low in the sky for anyone living north of the equator. It is most visible from locations such as Australia and South Africa during late Southern Hemisphere spring. Most of the constellation lies within, and can be located by, forming a triangle of the bright stars Achernar, Fomalhaut and Beta Ceti—Ankaa lies roughly in the centre of this.

==Features==
===Stars===

A curved line of stars comprising Alpha, Kappa, Mu, Beta, Nu and Gamma Phoenicis was seen as a boat by the ancient Arabs. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted and designated 27 stars with the Bayer designations Alpha through to Omega in 1756. Of these, he labelled two stars close together Lambda, and assigned Omicron, Psi and Omega to three stars, which subsequent astronomers such as Benjamin Gould felt were too dim to warrant their letters. A different star was subsequently labelled Psi Phoenicis, while the other two designations fell out of use.

Ankaa is the brightest star in the constellation. It is an orange giant of apparent visual magnitude 2.37 and spectral type K0.5IIIb, 77 light years distant from Earth and orbited by a secondary object about which little is known. Lying close by Ankaa is Kappa Phoenicis, a main sequence star of spectral type A5IVn and apparent magnitude 3.90. Located centrally in the asterism, Beta Phoenicis is the second brightest star in the constellation and another binary star. Together the stars, both yellow giants of spectral type G8, shine with an apparent magnitude of 3.31, though the components are of individual apparent magnitudes of 4.0 and 4.1 and orbit each other every 168 years. Zeta Phoenicis or &quot;Wurren&quot; is an Algol-type eclipsing binary, with an apparent magnitude fluctuating between 3.9 and 4.4 with a period of around 1.7 days (40 hours); its dimming results from the component two blue-white B-type stars, which orbit and block out each other from Earth. The two stars are 0.05 AU from each other, while a third star is around 600 AU away from the pair, and has an orbital period exceeding 5000 years. The system is around 300 light years distant. In 1976, researchers Clausen, Gyldenkerne, and Grønbech calculated that a nearby 8th magnitude star is a fourth member of the system.

AI Phe is an eclipsing binary star identified in 1972. Its long mutual eclipses and combination of spectroscopic and astrometric data allows precise measurement of the masses and radii of the stars which is viewed as a potential cross-check on stellar properties and distances independent on Ceiphid Variables and such techniques. The long eclipse events require space-based observations to avoid Solar interference.
Gamma Phoenicis is a red giant of spectral type M0IIIa and varies between magnitudes 3.39 and 3.49. It lies 235 light years away. Psi Phoenicis is another red giant, this time of spectral type M4III, and has an apparent magnitude that ranges between 4.3 and 4.5 over a period of around 30 days. Lying 340 light years away, it has around 85 times the diameter, but only 85% of the mass, of the Sun. W Phoenicis is a Mira variable, ranging from magnitude 8.1 to 14.4 over 333.95 days. A red giant, its spectrum ranges between M5e and M6e. Located 6.5 degrees west of Ankaa is SX Phoenicis, a variable star which ranges from magnitude 7.1 to 7.5 over a period of a mere 79 minutes. Its spectral type varies between A2 and F4. It gives its name to a group of stars known as SX Phoenicis variables. Rho and BD Phoenicis are Delta Scuti variables—short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars that have been used as standard candles and as subjects to study astroseismology. Rho is spectral type F2III, and ranges between magnitudes 5.20 and 5.26 over a period of 2.85 hours. BD is of spectral type A1V, and ranges between magnitudes 5.90 and 5.94.

Nu Phoenicis is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F9V and magnitude 4.96. Lying some 49 light years distant, it is around 1.2 times as massive as the Sun, and likely to be surrounded by a disk of dust. It is the closest star in the constellation that is visible with the unaided eye. Gliese 915 is a white dwarf only 26 light years away. It is of magnitude 13.05, too faint to be seen with the naked eye. White dwarfs are extremely dense stars compacted into a volume the size of the Earth. With around 85% of the mass of the Sun, Gliese 915 has a surface gravity of 108.39 ± 0.01 (2.45 · 108) cm·s−2, or approximately 250,000 of Earth&#x27;s.

Ten stars have been found to have planets to date, and four planetary systems have been discovered with the SuperWASP project. HD 142 is a yellow giant that has an apparent magnitude of 5.7, and has a planet (HD 142 b) 1.36 times the mass of Jupiter which orbits every 328 days. HD 2039 is a yellow subgiant with an apparent magnitude of 9.0 around 330 light years away which has a planet (HD 2039 b) six times the mass of Jupiter. WASP-18 is a star of magnitude 9.29 which was discovered to have a hot Jupiter-like planet (WASP-18b) taking less than a day to orbit the star. The planet is suspected to be causing WASP-18 to appear older than it really is. WASP-4 and WASP-5 are solar-type yellow stars around 1000 light years distant and of 13th magnitude, each with a single planet larger than Jupiter. WASP-29 is an orange dwarf of spectral type K4V and visual magnitude 11.3, which has a planetary companion of similar size and mass to Saturn. The planet completes an orbit every 3.9 days.

WISE J003231.09-494651.4 and WISE J001505.87-461517.6 are two brown dwarfs discovered by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, and are 63 and 49 light years away respectively. Initially hypothesised before they were belatedly discovered, brown dwarfs are objects more massive than planets, but which are of insufficient mass for hydrogen fusion characteristic of stars to occur. Many are being found by sky surveys.

Phoenix contains HE0107-5240, possibly one of the oldest stars yet discovered. It has around 1/200,000 the metallicity that the Sun has and hence must have formed very early in the history of the universe. With a visual magnitude of 15.17, it is around 10,000 times dimmer than the faintest stars visible to the naked eye and is 36,000 light years distant.

===Deep-sky objects===
The constellation does not lie on the galactic plane of the Milky Way, and there are no prominent star clusters. NGC 625 is a dwarf irregular galaxy of apparent magnitude 11.0 and lying some 12.7 million light years distant. Only 24000 light years in diameter, it is an outlying member of the Sculptor Group. NGC 625 is thought to have been involved in a collision and is experiencing a burst of active star formation. NGC 37 is a lenticular galaxy of apparent magnitude 14.66. It is approximately 42 kiloparsecs (137,000 light-years) in diameter and about 12.9 billion years old. Robert&#x27;s Quartet (composed of the irregular galaxy NGC 87, and three spiral galaxies NGC 88, NGC 89 and NGC 92) is a group of four galaxies located around 160 million light-years away which are in the process of colliding and merging. They are within a circle of radius of 1.6 arcmin, corresponding to about 75,000 light-years. Located in the galaxy ESO 243-49 is HLX-1, an intermediate-mass black hole—the first one of its kind identified. It is thought to be a remnant of a dwarf galaxy that was absorbed in a collision with ESO 243-49. Before its discovery, this class of black hole was only hypothesized.

Lying within the bounds of the constellation is the gigantic Phoenix cluster, which is around 7.3 million light years wide and 5.7 billion light years away, making it one of the most massive galaxy clusters. It was first discovered in 2010, and the central galaxy is producing an estimated 740 new stars a year. Larger still is El Gordo, or officially ACT-CL J0102-4915, whose discovery was announced in 2012. Located around 7.2 billion light years away, it is composed of two subclusters in the process of colliding, resulting in the spewing out of hot gas, seen in X-rays and infrared images.

===Meteor showers===
Phoenix is the radiant of two annual meteor showers. The Phoenicids, also known as the December Phoenicids, were first observed on 3 December 1887. The shower was particularly intense in December 1956, and is thought related to the breakup of the short-period comet 289P/Blanpain. It peaks around 4–5 December, though is not seen every year. A very minor meteor shower peaks around July 14 with around one meteor an hour, though meteors can be seen anytime from July 3 to 18; this shower is referred to as the July Phoenicids.

<doc id="49124" wikidata="Q1061747" url="?curid=49124" title="Phoenix (son of Amyntor)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Phoenix (Ancient Greek: Φοῖνιξ &quot;Phoinix&quot;, gen. Φοίνικος &quot;Phoinikos&quot;) was the son of king Amyntor. Because of a dispute with his father, Phoenix fled to Phthia, where he became king of the Dolopians, and tutor of the young Achilles, whom he accompanied to the Trojan War. After Achilles had in anger withdrawn from the war, Phoenix tried to persuade Achilles to return.

Phoenix appears as a character in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, where Homer has him tell his story. He is also mentioned several times in the Epic Cycle. There were several lost 5th-century BC tragedies titled &quot;Phoenix&quot;, which presumably told his story, and he appeared as a character in several others. Mentions of Phoenix occur in Pindar, the &quot;Palatine Anthology&quot;, Lycophron, Ovid and Hyginus, and a brief account of his story is given by the mythographer Apollodorus. Phoenix also appears in many works of ancient art from as early as the 6th century BC.

== Mythology ==
Phoenix was the son of Amyntor. A dispute with his father, concerning his father&#x27;s concubine, resulted in Phoenix fleeing his homeland for Phthia, where he became a vassal of Achilles&#x27; father Peleus, the king. As told in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, on the urgings of his jealous mother (variously named as Cleobule, Hippodameia, or Alcimede), Phoenix had had sex with his father&#x27;s concubine. Amyntor, discovering this, called upon the Erinyes to curse Phoenix with childlessness. In later accounts of the story, Phoenix was falsely accused by Amyntor&#x27;s concubine, and blinded by his father, but Chiron restored his sight. In either case, Phoenix fled to Phthia, where Peleus made Phoenix a king of the Dolopians, and gave him his young son Achilles to raise.

Phoenix participated in the Calydonian boar hunt, and was said to have given Achilles&#x27;s son the name Neoptolemus. As an old man, he went with Odysseus and Nestor to find and recruit Achilles for the Trojan War, and was Achilles&#x27;s companion at Troy. After Achilles, in his anger at Agamemnon, had withdrawn from the fighting, Phoenix was part of the unsuccessful embassy sent by Agamemnon to persuade Achilles to return to the battle. After Achilles died, Phoenix was one of those sent to fetch Neoptolemus from Scyros. On his way home from Troy, Phoenix died and was buried by Neoptolemus. His tomb was said to be either in Eion, Macedonia, or in Trachis, Thessaly, nearby the &quot;Phoenix River&quot; which was said to have been named after the hero.

==Sources==
===The &quot;Iliad&quot;===
Phoenix plays an important role in Book 9 of the &quot;Iliad&quot; of Homer. Achilles, the Greeks&#x27; greatest warrior, has withdrawn from the war because of his great anger at his ill treatment by the Greek commander Agamemnon. Phoenix, who had been in charge of Achilles&#x27;s upbringing, now an old man, has accompanied Achilles to the Trojan War. Phoenix is sent by Agamemnon to Achilles&#x27;s tent, as part of an embassy with Ajax and Odysseus, to persuade Achilles to return to the battle. Odysseus speaks first, presenting Agamemnon&#x27;s offer of reconciliation, an appeal which Achilles rejects utterly, saying that he will leave with his ships the next morning. Next Phoenix—who as his tutor, as he reminds Achilles, has taught him &quot;to be both a speaker of words and a doer of deeds&quot;—begins himself a long speech covering 172 lines. Phoenix, &quot;bursting into tears&quot;, pleads passionately with Achilles to put down his anger and return to the war. Phoenix&#x27;s speech presents an &quot;exposition of heroic, traditional ethics&quot;.

Phoenix begins his appeal, in personal terms, by reminding Achilles how he came to be a second father to Achilles. Phoenix&#x27;s father was Amyntor, the son of Ormenus, and a king in Hellas. When Amyntor forsook his wife, Phoenix&#x27;s mother, for a concubine, at the urging of his jealous mother, Phoenix had sex with Amyntor&#x27;s concubine. To punish this crime Amyntor called upon the Erinyes to curse Phoenix with childlessness. Outraged Phoenix intended to kill Amyntor, but was finally dissuaded. Instead he decided to leave his father&#x27;s kingdom. For nine days some of his friends and family kept watch over him to prevent his leaving, but finally on the tenth day he managed to escape, and fleeing through Hellas, Phoenix came to Phthia, where king Peleus, the father of Achilles, took in Phoenix, and treated him like a son. Peleus made Phoenix a king of the Dolopians. And Phoenix was given charge of the young Achilles, whom Phoenix reared as a son. Having reminded Achilles of all this, Phoenix asks Achilles to &quot;master thy proud spirit; it beseemeth thee not to have a pitiless heart. Nay, even the very gods can bend&quot;.

Phoenix next relates two stories meant to persuade Achilles to relent. The first story concerns the &quot;Litai&quot; (&quot;Prayers&quot;), daughters of Zeus, who follow along after &quot;Ate&quot; (&quot;Sin&quot;). This story is meant to show Achilles the dangers inherent in refusing prayers of supplication. After telling the story, Phoenix again asks Achilles to &quot;cast aside thine anger&quot; and heed the supplication of his comrads in arms and return to the battle. Phoenix reminds Achilles that heroes of old, in their wrath, might be won over by gifts and pleadings. He then recounts the story of the hero Meleager, with its many parallels to Achilles&#x27;s situation. Like Achilles, Meleager has withdrawn from battle in anger. Offering gifts, his friends and family beg Meleager to return to the battle, but he refuses them. But when his own household is threatened, finally heeding the pleas of his wife, he returns to the battle, but received no gifts and honors, for doing so. Finally Phoenix urges Achilles not to be like Meleager, but to accept the gifts and honors Agammenon has offered, before it is too late.

But Achilles, responding to Phoenix, says he has no need of such gifts and has honor enough already. Further he admonishes Phoenix &quot;not to confound my spirit by weeping and sorrowing,&quot; on Agamemnon&#x27;s behalf. Nevertheless, Achilles invites Phoenix to stay the night &quot;and at break of day we will take counsel whether to return to our own or to tarry here.&quot;

Brief mentions of Phoenix also appear in Books 16, 17, 19, and 23. In Book 16 Phoenix leads a company of Myrmidons into battle. In Book 17, Athena takes Phoenix&#x27;s form, as she urges on Menelaus in the heat of battle. In Book 19, Phoenix is among those comforting Achilles in his tent after the death of Patroclus. In Book 23, Phoenix is an umpire in Patroclus&#x27;s funeral games.

===Epic Cycle===
Besides the &quot;Iliad&quot; a few other mentions of Phoenix, from the epic tradition, are found in the Epic Cycle, a collection of epic poems about the Trojan War.
According to scholia to &quot;Iliad&quot; 19, citing the Epic Cycle, prior to the Trojan War, Phoenix was sent with Odysseus and Nestor to seek out Achilles (who, as it turns out, is hiding on Skyros disguised as a girl) to recruit him for the war. According to the &quot;Cypria&quot;, (one of the poems in the Epic Cycle) Achilles&#x27;s son Neoptolemus, originally named Pyrrhus, was given the name Neoptolemus (&quot;young soldier&quot;) by Phoenix, because Achilles was a young man when he went to war. According to Proclus&#x27; summary of the &quot;Nostoi&quot;, Phoenix, while traveling home from the Trojan War with Neoptolemus, died and was buried by Neoptolemus.

===Later sources===
The late sixth-century early fifth-century BC poet Pindar mentioned Phoenix, saying that he &quot;held a throng of Dolopians, bold in the use of the sling and bringing aid to the missiles of the Danaans, tamers of horses.&quot; Phoenix appeared as a character in tragedian Aeschylus&#x27; lost play &quot;Myrmidons&quot; (–480), which included an embassy scene, and presumably Phoenix&#x27;s attempt to persuade Achilles to put aside his anger and return to the battlefield.

The tragedian Sophocles, in his play &quot;Philoctetes&quot; (409 BC), tells us that after Achilles died at Troy, the Greeks received a prophecy which said that they would never take Troy unless Neoptolemus came to fight for them, so the Greeks sent Phoenix and Odysseus to Scyros to bring Neoptolemus back with them to Troy. A red-figure volute-krater (), had already depicted Neoptolemus, with Phoenix and Odysseus (all named), saying goodbye to his mother and grandfather Lycomedes on Skyros (Ferrara 44701).

Sophocles, and his fellow fifth-century tragedians Euripides, and Ion of Chios, among others, all wrote plays titled &quot;Phoenix&quot;, now lost, which presumably told the story of Phoenix&#x27;s conflict with his father. Nothing is known about the plays by Sophocles or Ion. However, from an allusion in Aristophanes&#x27; play &quot;The Acharnians&quot;, Euripides seems to have represented Phoenix as blind. Moreover, evidence indicates that in Euripides&#x27; version of the story, Phoenix is falsely accused of rape by his father&#x27;s concubine, and is blinded by Amyntor in punishment.

The Cyzicene epigrams, the third book of the &quot;Palatine Anthology&quot;, refers to the blinding of Phoenix by Amyntor, with Phoenix&#x27;s mother, here named Alcimede, trying to restrain her husband. The poet Lycophron alludes to Phoenix, and his blinding by his father, and the poet Propertius, mentions Chiron restoring Phoenix&#x27;s sight.

Lycophron also connects Phoenix with Eion, where he was said to have been buried. Lycophron scholia name Phoenix&#x27;s mother Cleobule, and give the concubine&#x27;s name as either Clytie or Phthia. According to the A scholia to &quot;Iliad&quot; 9.448, Phoenix&#x27;s mother was named Hippodameia, and the concubine Clytia.

Both the poet Ovid and the mythographer Hyginus say that Phoenix was one of the heroes to have participated in the hunt for the Calydonian Boar. And Virgil in his Aeneid, has Phoenix and Odysseus, during the sack of Troy, in a temple, in Priam&#x27;s palace, standing guard over Troy&#x27;s treasures.

The mythographer Apollodorus, probably drawing on Euripides&#x27; &quot;Phoenix&quot;, says that Phoenix was falsely accused of seducing Amyntor&#x27;s concubine Phthia. Amyntor blinded Phoenix, but Peleus brought Phoenix to the centaur Chiron who restored his sight. Peleus then made Phoenix king of the Dolopians. Apollodorus mentions the embassy of Odysseus, Phoenix, and Ajax, to Achilles. Like Sophocles, Apollodorus says Phoenix and Odysseus were sent to bring Neoptolemus to Troy, and agreeing with Proclus, says that after the war, traveling home with Neoptolemus, Phoenix died and Neoptolemus buried him.

The Greek comic poet Eubulus wrote a play titled &quot;Phoenix&quot;, so too did the Latin poet Ennius. The 4th-century AD (?) Greek poet Quintus Smyrnaeus, in his epic poem &quot;Posthomerica&quot;, has Phoenix welcome Achilles&#x27;s son Neoptolemus to Troy, and give a speech telling Neoptolemus about his father. According to the c. 4th-century AD Dictys Cretensis, Achilles, Ajax, and Phoenix were the commanders of the Greek&#x27;s Trojan War fleet.

==Iconography==
Phoenix is depicted in several ancient works of art, from as early as He can often be distinguished by his white hair and beard, in contrast to the black of the other figures, as in the red-figure kylix by the Brygos Painter (), where he is being served wine by Briseis (Louvre G152 shown above).

The embassy to Achilles, from Book 9 of Homer&#x27;s Iliad, becomes a popular scene on Attic vases of the early fifth century BC, with Phoenix being a prominent figure. A dozen or so Attic vases depict the scene. The earliest of these, c. 490 BC, is a red-figure calyx-krater attributed to the Eucharides Painter (Louvre G163). It depicts, on the left, Phoenix standing behind a seated Odysseus, both facing right, and on the right, Diomedes (rather than the expected Ajax) standing behind a seated Achilles, both facing left, all named by inscription. Though without his usual white hair, Phoenix here is still recognizably older than the other three men. Other vases showing similar embassy scenes include: Antikensammlungen 8770 (shown above), and Louvre G146 (shown right).

Phoenix also appears on several other vases. On a black-figure Tyrrhenian amphora, c. 570 BC, (London 1897.0727.2), Phoenix is shown as part of a scene depicting Polyxena&#x27;s slaughter at the tomb of Achilles. While Neoptolemus cuts Polyxena&#x27;s throat, Phoenix stands on the far right, with his back turned looking away (perhaps disapproving or unable to watch). As noted above, Phoenix appears with Odysseus and Neoptolemos on a red-figure volute-krater (), in a scene depicting Neoptolemos&#x27; departure from Skyros (Ferrara 44701). Phoenix is probably also depicted on a red-figure kylix, by Euphronios, leading a procession, followed by a woman with hand to head (Thetis?) looking back, Ajax carrying Achilles&#x27;s corpse, and a warrior (probably Odysseus) at the rear of the procession (J. Paul Getty Museum 77.AE.20).

Phoenix appears on both sides of an Athenian red-figure stamnos, c. 480 BC, attributed to the Triptolemos Painter (Antikenmuseum BS 477). The B. side is another embassy to Achilles scene. Phoenix, his long white hair tied up in back, stands on the right, behind the seated Achilles. On the A. side, Phoenix on the left, named by inscription, restrains either Ajax or Achilles, while Priam on the right, also depicted with long white hair tied up in the back, restrains Hector. If the warrior being restrained by Phoenix is Ajax, then this would appear to be Ajax&#x27;s dual with Hector from &quot;Iliad&quot; 7, otherwise this might be Achilles&#x27;s dual with Hektor, following the death of Patroclus, although the &quot;Iliad&quot; does not mention Phoenix&#x27;s involvement in either dual. A related scene occurs on an Athenian red-figure amphora () by the Kleophrades Painter (Martin von Wagner Museum L508). On the A. side, Phoenix (named) restrains a warrior (Ajax?), while on the B. side, another old man (Priam?) restrains Hektor (named).
