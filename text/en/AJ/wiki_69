<text>The Office of National Assessments (ONA) was an Australian statutory intelligence agency established by the &quot;Office of National Assessments Act 1977&quot; as an independent statutory body directly accountable to the Prime Minister of Australia as a portfolio agency of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. ONA provided all-source assessments on international political, strategic and economic developments to the Prime Minister and the National Security Committee of Cabinet. ONA also played a coordination role in the Australian Intelligence Community through evaluating foreign intelligence products, convening the National Intelligence Coordination Committee, and developing relationships with intelligence agencies around the world.

ONA was regarded as the Australian equivalent of the United Kingdom Joint Intelligence Organisation, a combination of the United States Office of the Director of National Intelligence and United States Department of State Bureau of Intelligence and Research, and the New Zealand National Assessments Bureau.

On 18 July 2017, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced the creation of the [[Office of National Intelligence (Australia)|Office of National Intelligence]] in line with recommendations from the 2017 Independent Review of the Australian Intelligence Community led by Michael L&#x27;Estrange and Stephen Merchant. ONI was formally stood up on 20 December 2018.

== History ==
The origins of ONA stem from recommendations of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security (also known as the First Hope Commission) which was established on 21 August 1974 by Australia&#x27;s Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and led by Justice Robert Hope, for the formation of an independent agency to provide intelligence assessments on political, strategic and economic issues directly to the Prime Minister. The Commission reported in 1977 to the Australian Government led by Malcolm Fraser, and four of its eight reports were tabled in Parliament.

The ONA was established under the &quot;Office of National Assessments Act 1977&quot;, which ensured ONA&#x27;s statutory independence from government. ONA began operations on 20 February 1978, assuming the Joint Intelligence Organisation&#x27;s foreign intelligence assessment role. The Joint Intelligence Organisation retained its defence intelligence assessment role until it was restructured as the Defence Intelligence Organisation in 1990.

The formation of the Office of National Intelligence was announced by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on 18 July 2017 in line with recommendations from the 2017 Independent Review of the Australian Intelligence Community led by Michael L&#x27;Estrange and Stephen Merchant. The Office of National Intelligence subsumes the Office of National Assessments with an expended role in the strategic development and enterprise management of the National Intelligence Community. On 1 December 2017, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced Nick Warner, then Director-General of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and former Secretary of the Department of Defence, to serve as the Director-General of the Office of National Intelligence. ONI was formally stood up on 20 December 2018.

===Media reporting===
Although not a secret organisation, ONA usually attracts little attention. However, a striking exception occurred in 2001 when Prime Minister John Howard publicly relied upon an ONA assessment to support his claims about asylum seekers on the MV &quot;Tampa&quot;, in an incident which became known as the &quot;Tampa affair&quot;. The ONA assessment was later leaked to the public in its entirety, showing that the assessment was ultimately based on nothing more than press releases from various government ministers.

In 2003, in the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, an ONA intelligence officer named Andrew Wilkie resigned from the agency, citing ethical concerns in relation to selective and exaggerated use of intelligence by the Australian Government on the matter of Iraq and weapons of mass destruction.

===Flood Report===
ONA has experienced substantial growth since the release of the report into intelligence agencies by Philip Flood which recommended a doubling of the agency&#x27;s budget and staffing resources and formalisation of the agency&#x27;s role as a coordinator and evaluator of the other Australian foreign intelligence agencies. The only ONA specific recommendation not implemented from the Flood report was the renaming of ONA to the Australian Foreign Intelligence Assessment Agency (AFIAA).

== Role and responsibilities ==
ONA is an all-source intelligence assessment agency which reports directly to the Prime Minister. ONA provides assessments on international political, strategic and economic developments and analyses intelligence products of the Australian Intelligence Community. ONA plays a leadership role in the Australian Intelligence Community through coordination and evaluation of Australia&#x27;s foreign intelligence activities. ONA also collects and analyses open-source intelligence.

Ultimately the ONA assessments are designed to assist the Australian Government in strategic decision making and ensure that government is fully briefed on international developments and emerging threats both in the Indo-Pacific region and around world.

==Organisational structure==
The ONA is divided into analytic branches covering geographic or thematic areas including:

Before its move, ONA had been a sub-tenant in the Central Office building of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) in Russell, Canberra.

<text>In gardening and agronomic terminology, a volunteer is a plant that grows on its own, rather than being deliberately planted by a farmer or gardener. The action of such plants — to sprout or grow in this fashion — may also be described as volunteering.

==Background==
Volunteers often grow from seeds that float in on the wind, are dropped by birds, or are inadvertently mixed into compost. Some volunteers may be encouraged by gardeners once they appear, being watered, fertilized, or otherwise cared for, unlike weeds, which are unwanted volunteers. 

Volunteers that grow from the seeds of specific cultivars are not reliably identical or similar to their parent and often differ significantly from it. Such open pollinated plants, if they show desirable characteristics, may be selected to become new cultivars.

==Agriculture==

In agricultural rotations, self-set plants from the previous year&#x27;s crop may become established as weeds in the current crop. For example, volunteer winter wheat will germinate to quite high levels in a following oilseed rape crop, usually requiring chemical control measures. 

In agricultural research, the high purity of a harvested crop is often desirable. To achieve this, typically a group of temporary workers will walk the crop rows looking for volunteer plants, or &quot;rogue&quot; plants in an exercise typically referred to as &quot;roguing&quot;.

<text>The Battle of Chosin Reservoir, also known as the Chosin Reservoir Campaign or the Battle of Lake Changjin (), was an important battle in the Korean War. The name &quot;Chosin&quot; is derived from the Japanese pronunciation &quot;&quot;Chōshin&quot;, instead of the Korean pronunciation.

The battle took place about a month after the People&#x27;s Republic of China entered the conflict and sent the People&#x27;s Volunteer Army (PVA) 9th Corps to infiltrate the northeastern part of North Korea. On 27 November 1950, the Chinese force surprised the US X Corps commanded by Major General Edward Almond in the Chosin Reservoir area. A brutal 17-day battle in freezing weather soon followed. Between 27 November and 13 December, 30,000 United Nations Command troops, later nicknamed &quot;The Chosin Few&quot;, under the field command of Major General Oliver P. Smith were encircled and attacked by about 120,000 Chinese troops under the command of Song Shilun, who had been ordered by Mao Zedong to destroy the UN forces. 

The UN forces were nevertheless able to break out of the encirclement and withdraw to the port of Hungnam. Both sides suffered heavy casualties, especially the Chinese, with both battle casualties and non-battle casualties caused by the frigid weather. The withdrawal of the US Eighth Army from northwest Korea in the aftermath of the Battle of the Ch&#x27;ongch&#x27;on River and the evacuation of the X Corps from the port of Hungnam in northeast Korea marked the complete withdrawal of UN troops from North Korea. Described by U.S. historians as the &quot;greatest evacuation movement by sea in U.S. military history,&quot; a fleet of 193 ships evacuated UN troops, heavy equipment, and approximately one-third of the Korean refugees. By the end of the operation, Chinese forces had advanced and reclaimed nearly all of North Korea.

==Background==

By mid-October 1950, after the successful landing at Inchon by the US X Corps, the Eighth Army breakout from the Pusan Perimeter and the subsequent pursuit and destruction of the Korean People&#x27;s Army (KPA), the Korean War appeared to be all but over. United Nations (UN) forces advanced rapidly into North Korea with the intention of reuniting North and South Korea before the end of 1950. North Korea is divided through the center by the impassable Taebaek Mountains, which separated the UN forces into two groups. The US Eighth Army advanced north through the western coast of the Korean Peninsula, while the Republic of Korea (ROK) I Corps and the US X Corps advanced north on the eastern coast.

At the same time the People&#x27;s Republic of China entered the conflict after issuing several warnings to the United Nations. On 19 October 1950, large formations of Chinese troops, dubbed the People&#x27;s Volunteer Army (PVA), secretly crossed the border and into North Korea. One of the first Chinese units to reach the Chosin Reservoir area was the PVA 42nd Army, which was tasked with stopping the eastern UN advances. On 25 October, the advancing ROK I Corps made contact with the Chinese and halted at Funchilin Pass (), south of the Chosin Reservoir. 

After the landing at Wonsan, the US 1st Marine Division of the X Corps engaged the defending PVA 124th Division on 2 November; the ensuing battle caused heavy casualties among the Chinese. On 6 November, the PVA 42nd Corps ordered a retreat to the north with the intention of luring the UN forces into the Chosin Reservoir. By 24 November, the 1st Marine Division occupied both Sinhung-ni () on the eastern side of the reservoir and Yudami-ni () on the west side.

Faced with the sudden attacks by Chinese forces in the Eighth Army sector, General Douglas MacArthur ordered the Eighth Army to launch the Home-by-Christmas Offensive. To support the offensive, MacArthur ordered the X Corps to attack west from the Chosin Reservoir and to cut the vital Manpojin—Kanggye—Huichon supply line. In response, Major General Edward M. Almond, commander of the US X Corps, formulated a plan on 21 November. It called for the US 1st Marine Division to advance west through Yudami-ni, while the US 7th Infantry Division would provide a regimental combat team to protect the right flank at Sinhung-ni. The US 3rd Infantry Division would also protect the left flank, while providing security in the rear area. By then the X Corps was stretched thin along a 400-mile front.

Surprised by the Marine landing at Wonsan, Chinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong called for the immediate destruction of the ROK Capital Division, ROK 3rd Infantry Division, US 1st Marine Division, and US 7th Infantry Division in a telegram to Commander Song Shilun of the PVA 9th Corps on 31 October. Under Mao&#x27;s urgent orders, the 9th Corps was rushed into North Korea on 10 November. Undetected by UN intelligence, it entered the Chosin Reservoir area on 17 November, with the 20th Army of the 9th Corps relieving the 42nd Army near Yudami-ni.

==Prelude==
===Location, terrain and weather===
Chosin Reservoir is a man-made lake located in the northeast of the Korean peninsula. The name Chosin is the Japanese pronunciation of the Korean place name Changjin, and the name stuck due to the outdated Japanese maps used by UN forces. The battle&#x27;s main focus was around the road that connects Hungnam and Chosin Reservoir, which served as the only retreat route for the UN forces. Through these roads, Yudami-ni and Sinhung-ni, located at the west and east side of the reservoir respectively, are connected at Hagaru-ri (now Changjin-ŭp) (). From there, the road passes through Koto-ri () and eventually leads to the port of Hungnam. The area around the Chosin Reservoir was sparsely populated.

The battle was fought over some of the roughest terrain during some of the harshest winter weather conditions of the Korean War. The road was created by cutting through the hilly terrain of Korea, with steep climbs and drops. Dominant peaks, such as the Funchilin Pass and the Toktong Pass (), overlook the entire length of the road. The road&#x27;s quality was poor, and in some places it was reduced to a one-lane gravel trail. On 14 November 1950, a cold front from Siberia descended over the Chosin Reservoir, and the temperature plunged, according to estimates, to as low as . The cold weather created considerable danger of frostbite casualties and was accompanied by frozen ground, icy roads, and weapon malfunctions. Medical supplies froze; morphine syrettes had to be defrosted in a medic&#x27;s mouth before they could be injected; blood plasma was frozen and useless on the battlefield. Even cutting off clothing to deal with a wound risked gangrene and frostbite. Batteries used for the Jeeps and radios did not function properly in the temperature and quickly ran down. The lubrication in the guns gelled and rendered them useless in battle. Likewise, the springs on the firing pins would not strike hard enough to fire the round, or would jam.

===Forces and strategies===


Although the 1st Marine Division landed at Wonsan as part of Almond&#x27;s US X Corps, Almond and Major General Oliver P. Smith of the 1st Marine Division shared a mutual loathing of each other that dated back to a meeting before the landing at Inchon, when Almond had spoken of how easy amphibious landings are even though he had never been involved in one. Smith believed there were large numbers of Chinese forces in North Korea despite the fact that higher headquarters in Tokyo said otherwise, but Almond felt Smith was overly cautious. The mutual distrust between the commanders caused Smith to slow the 1st Marine Division&#x27;s advance towards the Chosin Reservoir in violation of Almond&#x27;s instructions. Smith established supply points and airfields along the way at Hagaru-ri and Koto-ri.

As the US X Corps was pushing towards the reservoir, the Chinese formulated their strategy, based on their experiences in the Chinese Civil War. Working from the assumption that only a light UN presence would be at the reservoir, the Chinese 9th Corps was first to destroy the UN garrisons at Yudami-ni and Sinhung-ni, then push towards Hagaru-ri. Believing the bulk of the US X Corps would move to rescue the destroyed units, the 9th Corps would then block and trap the main UN forces on the road between Hagaru-ri and Hungnam. The 9th Corps initially committed eight divisions for the battle, with most of the forces concentrated at Yudami-ni and Sinhung-ni.

The flaw in the Chinese plan was a lack of accurate intelligence about the UN forces. Even though the US X Corps was stretched thin over northeast Korea, the slow Marine advance allowed the bulk of the US 1st Marine Division, including the 5th, 7th and 11th Marines, to be concentrated at Yudami-ni. Furthermore, the strategically important Hagaru-ri, where a C-47-capable airfield was under construction and a supply dump, was not a priority for the Chinese despite being lightly defended by the 1st and 7th Marines. Only Regimental Combat Team 31 (RCT-31), an understrength and hastily formed regimental combat team of the US 7th Infantry Division, was thinly spread along the eastern bank of the reservoir. Those units later took the brunt of the Chinese assaults. 

As for the UN forces, the 1st Marine Division had an effective strength of 25,473 men at the start of the battle, and it was further reinforced by the British Royal Marines unit 41 (Independent) Commando and the equivalent of two regiments from the 3rd and 7th Army Infantry Divisions. The UN forces had a combined strength of about 30,000 men during the course of the battle. The UN forces at Chosin were also supported by one of the greatest concentrations of air power during the Korean War, since the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing stationed at Yonpo Airfield and five aircraft carriers from the US Navy&#x27;s Task Force 77 were able to launch 230 sorties daily to provide close air support during the battle, while the US Air Force Far East Combat Cargo Command in Japan reached the capacity of airdropping 250 tons of supplies per day to resupply the trapped UN forces.

Although the 9th Corps was one of China&#x27;s elite formations, composed of veterans and former POWs from the Huaihai Campaign, several deficiencies hampered its ability during the battle. Initially the 9th Corps was intended to be outfitted in Manchuria during November, but Mao suddenly ordered it into Korea before that could happen. As a result, the 9th Corps had almost no winter clothing for the harsh Korean winter. Similarly, poor logistics forced the 9th Corps to abandon heavy artillery, while working with little food and ammunition. The food shortage forced the 9th Corps to initially station a third of its strength away from the Chosin Reservoir in reserve, and starvation and exposure weakened the Chinese units, since foraging was not an option in the sparsely populated area. By the end of the battle, more Chinese troops had died from the cold than from combat and air raids.

Chinese strength is usually estimated at 120,000 troops for the battle. Before arriving in Korea, the 9th Corps was also reinforced. Each of its three corps had four divisions instead of the regular three; thus it had 12 divisions, with 10,000 men per division. Infantry from two formerly &quot;liberated&quot; (surrendered) Nationalist divisions were absorbed to bring each infantry company up to strength. Some companies had approximately 150 men, while others were reinforced with more than 200 men. However, attrition due to UN air raids, poor logistics and cold weather had also taken a toll on the way to the battlefield. On the day 9th Corps entered Korea, for example, frostbite inflicted 700 casualties, while most of its transport vehicles were destroyed by UN air raids. During the course of the battle, Chinese prisoners of war reported that most of the 9th Corps’ divisions had become under strength, numbering about 6,500 to 7,000 men per division. These factors, plus uncertainties over the Chinese order of battle in Western sources, led some historians to revise Chinese numbers down to as low as 60,000 during the course of battle.

Eventually, all 12 Chinese divisions of the 9th Corps were deployed, although the 78th and the 88th Divisions of the PVA 26th Army did not make contact with UN forces during the course of the battle. Eight divisions of the PVA 20th and 27th Armies served as the main attacking force. Four divisions of the PVA 26th Army initially were held back in reserve, and deployed after 20th and 27th Armies had exhausted all their available strength.

==Battle==

On the night of 27 November, the PVA 20th and 27th Armies of the 9th Corps launched multiple attacks and ambushes along the road between the Chosin Reservoir and Kot&#x27;o-ri. At Yudam-ni, the 5th, 7th and 11th Marines were surrounded and attacked by the PVA 79th and 89th Divisions, with the 59th Division attacking the road between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri to cut off communication. Similarly, RCT-31 was isolated and ambushed at Sinhung-ni by the PVA 80th and 81st Divisions. At Hagaru-ri, the 1st Marine Division command headquarters was targeted by the PVA 58th Division. Finally, the PVA 60th Division surrounded elements of the 1st Marines at Kot&#x27;o-ri from the north. Caught by complete surprise, the UN forces were cut off at Yudam-ni, Sinhung-ni, Hagaru-ri and Kot&#x27;o-ri by 28 November.

===Actions at Yudam-ni===

Acting on Almond&#x27;s order, Smith ordered the 5th Marines to attack west toward Mupyong-ni on 27 November. The attack was soon stalled by the PVA 89th Division and forced the Marines to dig in on the ridges surrounding Yudam-ni. As night came, three Chinese regiments of the 79th Division attacked the ridges on the north and northwest of Yudam-ni, hoping to annihilate the garrison in one stroke. Close quarters fighting soon developed as the attackers infiltrated Marine positions, but the 5th and 7th Marines held the line while inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese. As day broke on 28 November, the Chinese and Americans were locked in a stalemate around the Yudam-ni perimeter.

While the battle was underway at Yudam-ni, the PVA 59th Division blocked the road between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri by attacking the defending Charlie and Fox Companies of the 7th Marines. The successful assault forced Charlie Company to retreat into Yudam-ni, which left Fox Company, commanded by Captain William E. Barber, isolated on a hill overlooking the Toktong Pass, a vital pass that controlled the road. On 29 November, several efforts by the 7th Marines failed to rescue Fox Company, despite inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese. Aided by artillery from Hagaru-ri and Marine Corsair fighters, Fox Company managed to hold out for five days while enduring constant attacks by the PVA 59th Division.

After the heavy losses suffered by the PVA 79th Division at Yudam-ni, 9th Corps headquarter realized that the bulk of the 1st Marine Division was stationed at Yudam-ni, with a garrison strength double the initial estimate. Believing that any further assaults would be futile, Song Shilun ordered the 9th Corps to switch their main attacks toward Sinhung-ni and Hagaru-ri, leaving Yudam-ni alone from 28 to 30 November. At the same time, the US Eighth Army on the Korean western front was forced into full retreat at the Battle of the Ch&#x27;ongch&#x27;on River, and MacArthur ordered Almond to withdraw the US X Corps to the port of Hungnam. Acting on Almond and Smith&#x27;s instructions, Lieutenant Colonel Raymond L. Murray and Colonel Homer L. Litzenberg, commanders of the 5th and 7th Marines, respectively, issued a joint order to break out from Yudam-ni to Hagaru-ri on 30 November. Faced with tough fighting between the blocking Chinese divisions and the withdrawing Marines, Smith remarked: &quot;Retreat, hell! We&#x27;re not retreating, we&#x27;re just advancing in a different direction.&quot;

For the breakout, the Marines formed into a convoy with a single M4A3 Sherman tank in the lead. The plan was to have 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines (3/5) as the vanguard of the convoy, with three battalions covering the rear. At the same time, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines (1/7) would attack towards Fox Company in order to open the road at Toktong Pass. To start the breakout, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines (3/7) had to first attack south and capture Hills 1542 and 1419 in order to cover the road from Chinese attacks. The breakout was carried out under the air cover of the 1st Marine Air Wing.
On the morning of 1 December, 3/7 Marines engaged the PVA 175th Regiment of the 59th Division at Hills 1542 () and 1419 (). The Chinese defenders soon forced the Marines to dig in on the slopes between the road and the peaks when the convoy passed 3/7&#x27;s position by the afternoon. With Hagaru-ri still not captured, the PVA High Command scrambled the 79th Division to resume attacks on Yudam-ni, while the 89th Division rushed south towards Kot&#x27;o-ri. The Chinese struck at night, and the ferocity of the fighting forced the rear covering forces to call in night fighters to suppress the attacks. The fighting lasted well into the morning of 2 December until all the Marines had managed to withdraw from Yudam-ni.

At the same time, 1/7 Marines also tried to break the Chinese blockade at Hill 1419 on 1 December. Despite being badly reduced by combat, hunger and frostbite, the PVA 59th Division sent in its last five platoons and refused to yield. As night approached, 1/7 finally captured the peak and started to march through the hills on the east side of the road. Relying on the element of surprise, they managed to destroy several Chinese positions along the road. On the morning of 2 December, a joint attack by Fox Company and 1/7 secured the Toktong Pass, thus opening the road between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri.

Although the road had been opened between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri, the convoy still had to fight through the numerous Chinese positions on the hills overlooking the road. On the first night of the retreat, the Chinese struck the convoy in force and inflicted heavy casualties on 3/5 Marines. Although strong air cover suppressed most of the Chinese forces for the rest of the march, the cold weather, harassing fire, raiding parties, and roadblocks slowed the retreat to a crawl, while inflicting numerous casualties. Despite those difficulties, the convoy reached Hagaru-ri in an orderly fashion on the afternoon of 3 December, with the withdrawal completed on 4 December.

===East of the reservoir===

RCT-31, later known as &quot;Task Force Faith,&quot; was a hastily formed regimental combat team from the 7th Infantry Division that guarded the right flank of the Marine advance towards Mupyong-ni. Before the battle, RCT-31 was spread thin, with main elements separated on the hills north of Sinhung-ni, the Pyungnyuri Inlet west of Sinhung-ni, and the town of Hudong-ni () south of Sinhung-ni. Although the Chinese believed RCT-31 to be a reinforced regiment, the task force was actually understrength, with one battalion missing, due to the bulk of the 7th Infantry Division being scattered over northeast Korea.

On the night of 27 November, three regiments from the 80th Division attacked the northern hills () and the inlet, completely surprising the defenders. The 1st Battalion, 32nd Infantry, to the north of Sinhung-ni suffered heavy casualties, while the 57th Field Artillery Battalion and the 3rd Battalion, 31st Infantry, were almost overrun at Pyungnyuri Inlet. The Chinese also sent the 242nd Regiment of the 81st Division towards Hill 1221, (), an undefended hill that controlled the road between Sinhung-ni and Hudong-ni. As the night&#x27;s fighting ended, RCT-31 was split into three elements.

Believing that the defenders had been completely destroyed at the inlet, the Chinese stopped their attacks and proceeded to loot the American positions for food and clothing. As morning came on 28 November, the 3/31st Infantry counterattacked the PVA 239th Regiment at the inlet, driving the surprised Chinese back in a complete rout. In the afternoon, Almond flew into the Sinhung-ni perimeter of RCT-31, convinced that RCT-31 was strong enough to begin its attack north and deal with whatever &quot;remnants&quot; of Chinese forces were in their way. Almond ordered Colonel Allan D. Maclean, the commander of RCT-31, to resume the offensive north, while presenting Silver Stars to three of Maclean&#x27;s officers. In disgust, Lieutenant Colonel Don C. Faith, Jr., the commander of the 1/32nd Infantry, threw his medal into the snow.
On the night of 28 November, the PVA 80th Division attacked again with four regiments. At the inlet, the Chinese assault became a disaster as communications broke down, while devastating fire from the M16 and M19 anti-aircraft (AA) guns attached to the 57th Field Artillery Battalion swept the Chinese ranks. In the aftermath, the PVA 238th and the 239th Regiment together had fewer than 600 soldiers. The attacks by PVA 240th Regiment, on the other hand, forced Maclean to order a retreat from the northern hills towards Sinhung-ni. On 29 November, the 1st Battalion managed to break through the Chinese blockade and reached the Sinhung-ni perimeter, but Maclean was lost when he mistook some Chinese soldiers for American. The Chinese finally stopped their attacks on the night of 29 November, while waiting for fresh reinforcements.

While RCT-31 was under siege, Almond finally instructed the 1st Marine Division to rescue it by breaking out of Yudam-ni, an impossible order for Smith to implement. Only the 31st Tank Company tried to rescue RCT-31, by attacking Hill 1221 from Hudong-ni, but without infantry support, the two armored attacks on 28 and 29 November were stalled by slippery roads, rough terrain, and close infantry assaults. By 30 November, the US forces evacuated Hudong-ni in order to defend Hagaru-ri, leaving the rest of RCT-31 completely isolated.

On 30 November, Major General David G. Barr, the commander of the 7th Infantry Division, flew into Sinhung-ni and met with Faith, who by now had assumed command of RCT-31. Faith laid out the difficulties of a breakout, particularly the 500 wounded that RCT-31 had to bring along. On the same day, parts of the PVA 94th Division and the rest of the 81st Division arrived as reinforcements for the 80th Division. By midnight, six Chinese regiments renewed their attacks, and Zhan Danan, the commander of the 80th Division, ordered the complete destruction of RCT-31 before dawn. Again, the 57th Battalion&#x27;s AA guns held the Chinese at bay, but supplies of shells were desperately low. On the day of 1 December, Faith finally ordered RCT-31 to break out from Sinhung-ni and withdraw to Hagaru-ri.
The breakout began as soon as the weather allowed the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing to provide air cover on 1 December. As the soldiers formed a convoy and tried to leave the Sudong-ni perimeter, the PVA 241st Regiment immediately swarmed over the American forces, with three other regiments closing in. Left with no choice, the covering aircraft dropped napalm right in front of RCT-31, inflicting casualties on both American and Chinese troops. The resulting firestorm wiped out the blocking Chinese company, allowing the convoy to advance. As the front of RCT-31 made its way forward, heavy small arms fire caused many members of the rear guard to seek shelter below the road instead of protecting the trucks. Chinese fire also killed or wounded those already in the trucks as well as the drivers, who viewed the job as a form of suicide. Slowly, the convoy approached a roadblock under Hill 1221 in the late afternoon. Several parties tried to clear Hill 1221, but after taking part of the hill, the leaderless soldiers continued out onto the frozen reservoir instead of returning to the column. As Faith led an assault on the roadblock, he was hit by a Chinese grenade and subsequently died of his wounds. The convoy managed to fight past the first roadblock, but as it reached the second at Hudong-ni, RCT-31 disintegrated under Chinese attacks. Out of the original 2,500 soldiers, about 1,050 managed to reach Hagaru-ri, and only 385 survivors were deemed able-bodied. The remnants of RCT-31 were formed into a provisional army battalion for the rest of the battle.

===Actions at Hagaru-ri===

To support the Marine attack towards Mupyong-ni, Hagaru-ri became an important supply dump with an airfield under construction. Smith and 1st Marine Division headquarters were also located at Hagaru-ri. With the bulk of the 1st Marine Division gathered at Yudam-ni, Hagaru-ri was lightly defended by two battalions from the 1st and 7th Marines, the rest of the garrison being composed of engineers and rear support units from both the Army and the Marine Corps.

The original Chinese plan called for the 58th Division to attack Hagaru-ri on the night of 27 November, but the division became lost in the countryside due to the outdated Japanese maps it used. It was not until the dawn of 28 November that the 58th Division arrived at Hagaru-ri. Meanwhile, from the fighting and ambushes that had occurred the previous night, the garrison at Hagaru-ri noticed the Chinese forces around them. Lieutenant Colonel Thomas L. Ridge, commander of 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines (3/1), predicted the Chinese attack would come on the night of 28 November. Almost everyone, including rear support units with little combat training, was pressed into service on the front line due to the manpower shortage, and the entire perimeter was on full alert by 21:30.

It was not long before the PVA 173rd Regiment attacked the western and the southern perimeter, while the 172nd Regiment struck the hills on the northern perimeter. Despite the preparations, the understrength garrison was overwhelmed, with the Chinese opening several gaps in the defenses and reaching the rear areas. The resulting chaos, however, caused a breakdown in discipline among the Chinese soldiers, who began looting food and clothing instead of exploiting the situation. The defending Americans managed to destroy the Chinese forces in counterattacks, while a breakdown of communications between the Chinese regiments allowed the gaps to close. When the fighting stopped, the Chinese had only gained the East Hill () on the northern perimeter. Another attack was planned for the night of 29 November, but air raids by VMF-542 broke up the Chinese formations before it could be carried out.
Given the critical manpower shortage at Hagaru-ri, on 29 November, Smith ordered Colonel Lewis &quot;Chesty&quot; Puller of the First Marine Regiment to assemble a task force to be sent north from Kot&#x27;o-ri to open the road south of Hagaru-ri. A task force was formed with 921 troops from 41 (Royal Marine) Commando, G Company of the 1st Marines and B Company of the 31st Infantry. It was dubbed &quot;Task Force Drysdale&quot; after its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Douglas B. Drysdale, who also commanded 41 Commando. 

On the afternoon of 29 November, Task Force Drysdale pushed north from Koto-ri, while under constant attack from the PVA 60th Division. The task force&#x27;s harrowing experience later earned the road the nickname &quot;Hell Fire Valley&quot;. As the Chinese attacks dragged on, the task force became disorganized, and a destroyed truck in the convoy later split the task force into two segments. Although the lead segment fought its way into Hagaru-ri on the night of 29 November, the rear segment was destroyed. Despite suffering 162 dead and missing and 159 wounded, the task force managed to bring in 300 badly needed infantrymen for the defense at Hagaru-ri.

As more reinforcements arrived from Hudong-ni on 30 November, the garrisons attempted to recapture the East Hill. All efforts failed, despite the destruction of a Chinese company. When darkness settled, the PVA 58th Division gathered its remaining 1,500 soldiers in a last-ditch attempt to capture Hagaru-ri. The reinforced defenders annihilated most of the attacking forces, with only the defences around the East Hill giving way. As the Chinese tried to advance from the East Hill, they were cut down by the 31st Tank Company.

By 1 December, the PVA 58th Division was virtually destroyed, with the remainder waiting for reinforcements from the 26th Army of the 9th Corps. Much to the frustration of Song Shilun, the 26th Corps did not arrive before the Marines broke out of Yudam-ni. The airfield was opened to traffic on 1 December, allowing UN forces to bring in reinforcements and to evacuate the dead and wounded. With the Marines at Yudam-ni completing their withdrawal on 4 December, the trapped UN forces could finally start their breakout towards the port of Hungnam.

===Breakout===

After a short rest, the breakout began on 6 December, with the 7th Marines as the vanguard of the retreating column, while the 5th Marines covered the rear. At the same time, the much-delayed PVA 26th Army arrived at Hagaru-ri with its 76th and 77th Divisions to relieve the 58th and 60th Divisions. As the 7th Marines pushed aside the PVA 76th Division south of Hagaru-ri, the 5th Marines took over the Hagaru-ri perimeter and recaptured the East Hill from the 76th Division. In a last effort to stop the breakout, the customary Chinese night attack was launched, with the 76th and 77th Division striking the Hagaru-ri perimeter from all directions. The Marines repulsed the attacks, inflicting heavy casualties.

Meanwhile, the 7th Marines opened the road between Hagaru-ri and Koto-ri by capturing the high ground surrounding the road. But as soon as the Marines pulled out, the 77th Division returned to the peaks and attacked the column. Chaotic fighting broke out and the retreat was slowed to a crawl. The Marine night fighters returned to subdue the Chinese forces, and most of the blocking troops were eliminated. On 7 December, the rest of the column managed to reach Kot&#x27;o-ri with little difficulty, with the last elements reaching Kot&#x27;o-ri that night.

After the failure of the 26th Corps at Hagaru-ri, the PVA High Command ordered the 26th and 27th Corps to chase the escaping UN force, with the 20th Corps assigned to block the escape route. But with most of the 20th Corps destroyed at Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri, the only forces between Kot&#x27;o-ri and Hungnam were the remnants of the 58th and 60th Divisions. In desperation, Song Shilun ordered these troops to dig in at Funchilin Pass, while blowing up the vital bridge (), hoping the terrain and obstacles would allow the 26th and 27th Corps to catch up with the retreating UN forces. 

The PVA 180th Regiment that occupied Hill 1081 () blew up the original concrete bridge and two improvised replacements in succession, believing the bridge was rendered irreparable. In response, the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines (1/1) attacked Hill 1081 from the south, and the hill was captured on 9 December, though the defenders fought to the last man. At the same time, the 7th Marines and RCT-31 attacked the bridge from the north, only to encounter defenders who were already frozen in their foxholes.
With the path to Hungnam blocked at Funchilin Pass, eight C-119 Flying Boxcars flown by the US 314th Troop Carrier Wing were used to drop portable bridge sections by parachute. The bridge, consisting of eight separate long, sections, was dropped one section at a time, using a parachute on each section. Four of these sections, together with additional wooden extensions were successfully reassembled into a replacement bridge by Marine Corps combat engineers and the US Army 58th Engineer Treadway Bridge Company on 9 December, enabling UN forces to proceed. Outmaneuvered, the PVA 58th and 60th Divisions still tried to slow the UN advance with ambushes and raids, but after weeks of non-stop fighting, the two Chinese divisions combined had only 200 soldiers left. The last UN forces left Funchilin Pass by 11 December.

One of the last engagements during the withdrawal was an ambush at Sudong () by the pursuing PVA 89th Division, which Task Force Dog of the 3rd Infantry Division repulsed with little difficulty. The trapped UN forces finally reached the Hungnam perimeter by 21:00 on 11 December.

==Evacuation at Hungnam==

By the time the UN forces arrived at Hungnam, MacArthur had already ordered the evacuation of the US X Corps on 8 December in order to reinforce the US Eighth Army, which by then was badly depleted and retreating rapidly towards the 38th parallel. Following his orders, the ROK I Corps, the ROK 1st Marine Regiment and the US 3rd and 7th Infantry Divisions had also set up defensive positions around the port. Some skirmishes broke out between the defending US 7th, 17th and 65th Infantry and the pursuing PVA 27th Corps, but against the strong naval gun fire support provided by US Navy Task Force 90, the badly mauled 9th Corps was in no shape to approach the Hungnam perimeter.

In what US historians called the &quot;greatest evacuation movement by sea in US military history&quot;, a 193-ship armada assembled at the port and evacuated not only the UN troops, but also their heavy equipment and roughly a third of the Korean refugees. One Victory ship, the , evacuated 14,000 refugees by herself, despite being designed to carry only 12 passengers. The last UN unit left at 14:36 on 24 December, and the port was destroyed to deny its use to the Chinese. The PVA 27th Army entered Hungnam on the morning of 25 December.

==Aftermath==
===Casualties===
The US X Corps and the ROK I Corps reported a total of 10,495 battle casualties: 4,385 US Marines, 3,163 US Army personnel, 2,812 South Koreans attached to American formations and 78 British Royal Marines. The 1st Marine Division also reported 7,338 non-battle casualties due to the cold weather, adding up to a total of 17,833 casualties. Despite the losses, the US X Corps preserved much of its strength. About 105,000 soldiers, 98,000 civilians, 17,500 vehicles, and 350,000 tons of supplies were shipped from Hungnam to Pusan, and they later rejoined the war effort in Korea. Commanding General Smith was credited for saving the US X Corps from destruction, while the 1st Marine Division, 41 (Royal Marine) Commando and RCT-31 were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for their tenacity during the battle. Fourteen Marines, two soldiers and one Navy pilot received the Medal of Honor, and all of the UN troops that served at Chosin were later nicknamed &quot;The Chosin Few&quot;. 

According to official estimates by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army General Logistics Department published in 1988, the PVA 9th Corps suffered 21,366 combat casualties, including 7,304 killed. In addition, 30,732 non-combat casualties were attributed to the harsh Korean winter and lack of food. Total casualties thus amounted to 52,098 - more than one third of its total strength. Outside of official channels, the estimation of Chinese casualties has been described as high as 60,000 by Patrick C. Roe, the chairman of Chosin Few Historical Committee, citing the number of replacements requested by 9th Corps in the aftermath of the battle. Regardless of the varying estimates, historian Yan Xue of PLA National Defence University noted that the 9th Corps was put out of action for three months. With the absence of 9th Corps the Chinese order of battle in Korea was reduced to 18 infantry divisions by 31 December 1950, as opposed to the 30 infantry divisions present on 16 November 1950.

====Operation Glory====

During the battle, UN dead were buried at temporary grave sites along the road. Operation Glory took place from July to November 1954, during which the dead of each side were exchanged. The remains of 4,167 US soldiers were exchanged for 13,528 North Korean and Chinese dead. In addition, 546 civilians who died in UN prisoner-of-war camps were turned over to the South Korean government. After Operation Glory, 416 Korean War &quot;unknowns&quot; were buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, the &quot;Punchbowl Cemetery&quot; in Honolulu, Hawaii. According to a Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO) white paper, 1,394 names were also transmitted from the Chinese and North Koreans during the operation, of which 858 proved to be correct. 

The 4,167 returned remains were found to be 4,219 individuals, of whom 2,944 were found to be Americans, with all but 416 identified by name. Of the 239 Korean War unaccounted for, 186 are not associated with the Punchbowl Cemetery unknowns. From 1990 to 1994, North Korea excavated and returned more than 208 sets of remains, which possibly include 200 to 400 US servicemen, but very few have been identified due to the co-mingling of remains. From 2001 to 2005, more remains were recovered from the Chosin Battle site, and around 220 were recovered near the Chinese border between 1996 and 2006.

===Outcome assessment===
Roy E. Appleman, the author of US Army official history &quot;South to Naktong, North to Yalu&quot;, writes that both sides could claim victory: the PVA 9th Corps ultimately held the battlefield, while X Corps held off the PVA 9th Corps in a series of battles that enabled it to withdraw most of its forces as an effective tactical unit. Allan R. Millett qualifies his assessment of the battle as a Chinese &quot;geographic victory&quot; in that they ejected X Corps from North Korea with the PVA’s tactical failure of achieving their stated objective of destroying the 1st Marine Division, adding that the campaign gave the UN confidence that it could withstand the superior numbers of the Chinese forces. The official Chinese history, published by PLA Academy of Military Science, states that despite the heavy casualties, the PVA 9th Corps had earned its victory by successfully protecting the eastern flank of Chinese forces in Korea, while inflicting over 10,000 casualties to the UN forces.

Eliot A. Cohen writes that the retreat from Chosin was a UN victory which inflicted such heavy losses on the PVA 9th Corps that it was put out of action until March 1951. Paul M. Edwards, founder of the Center for the Study of the Korean War, draws parallels between the battle at Chosin and the Dunkirk evacuation. He writes that the retreat from Chosin following a &quot;massive strategic victory&quot; by the Chinese has been represented as &quot;a moment of heroic history&quot; for the UN forces. Appleman, on the other hand, questioned the necessity of a sea-borne evacuation to preserve the UN forces, asserting that X Corps had the strength to break out of the Chinese encirclement at Hungnam at the end of the battle. Chinese historian Li Xiaobing acknowledges X Corps&#x27; successful withdrawal from North Korea, and writes that the Battle of Chosin &quot;has become a part of Marine lore, but it was still a retreat, not a victory.&quot; Bruce Cumings simply refers to the battle as a &quot;terrible defeat&quot; for the Americans.

Patrick C. Roe, who served as an intelligence officer with the 7th Marine Regiment at Chosin, asserts that X Corps directly allowed the Eighth Army to hold the south and quoted MacArthur in corroborating his view. Yu Bin, a historian and a former member of the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army, states that while the destruction of Task Force Faith was viewed as the single greatest Chinese victory of the war, ultimately the PVA 9th Corps had become &quot;a giant hospital&quot; while failing to destroy the numerically inferior UN forces at Chosin as planned. , whose 26th Army was blamed for allowing the X Corps to escape, had threatened suicide over the outcome, while Song Shilun offered to resign his post.

The battle exacerbated inter-service hostility, the Marines blaming the US Army and its leadership for the failure. The collapse of the army units fighting on the east of the reservoir was regarded as shameful, and for many years afterwards their role in the battle was largely ignored. Later studies concluded that Task Force MacLean/Faith had held off for five days a significantly larger force than previously thought and that their stand was a significant factor in the Marines&#x27; survival. This was eventually recognized in September 1999 when, for its actions at Chosin, Task Force Faith was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation, an award that General Smith blocked when it was first proposed in 1952.

The Marines evacuated from North Korea and spent January and most of February 1951 rebuilding in the relatively secure South Korea, where they destroyed the well-respected but already weakened North Korean 10th Division in counter-guerrilla operations during the Second Battle of Wonju. The Marines returned to regular and heavy action on 21 February in Operation Killer.

===Wider effect on the war===
The battle ended the UN force&#x27;s expectation of total victory, including the capture of North Korea and the reunification of the peninsula. By the end of 1950, PVA/KPA forces had recaptured North Korea and pushed UN forces back south of the 38th parallel. Serious consideration was given to the evacuation of all US forces from the Korean peninsula and US military leaders made secret contingency plans to do so. The disregard by Far Eastern Command under MacArthur of the initial warnings and diplomatic hints by the PVA almost led the entire UN army to disaster at Ch&#x27;ongch&#x27;on River and Chosin Reservoir and only after the formation and stabilization of a coherent UN defensive line under Lieutenant General Matthew Ridgway did the &quot;period of headlong retreats from an attacking, unsuspected foe&quot; cease.

On the other hand, the battle affected the PVA in two ways, both of which had the result of helping the UN Command to secure its position in South Korea, while losing North Korea. First, according to historian Shu Guang Zhang, PVA commanders were persuaded by their victories at Chosin and Ch&#x27;ongch&#x27;on that they could &quot;defeat American armed forces&quot;, and this led to &quot;unrealistic expectations that the CPV [PVA] would work miracles.&quot; Second, the heavy casualties caused by sub-zero temperatures and combat, plus poor logistical support weakened the PVA&#x27;s eight elite divisions of the 20th and 27th Corps. Of those eight divisions, two were forced to disband. With the absence of 12 out of 30 of Chinese divisions in Korea in early 1951, Roe says that the heavy Chinese losses at Chosin enabled the UN forces to maintain a foothold in Korea.

===Request for nuclear weapons===
By the end of the withdrawal, the Chinese troops had advanced and retaken almost all of North Korean territories. On 24 December 1950, MacArthur submitted a list of &quot;retardation targets&quot; in Korea, Manchuria and other parts of China, and requested 34 atomic bombs from Washington with the purpose of sowing a belt of radioactive cobalt to prevent further Chinese advances. His request was firmly declined and led to his later dismissal.

==Legacy==
The Battle of Chosin Reservoir is regarded by some historians as the most brutal in American history due to violence, casualty rate, weather conditions, and endurance. Over the course of fourteen days, 17 Medals of Honor (Army and Navy) and 78 Service Cross Medals (Army and Navy) were awarded by the United States, the second most as of 2020 after the Battle of the Bulge (20 MOHs and 83 SCMs).

American veterans of the battle are colloquially referred to as the &quot;Chosin Few&quot; and symbolized by the &quot;Star of Koto-ri&quot;.

<doc id="49399" wikidata="Q1604486" url="?curid=49399" title="XY sex-determination system">
<text>The XY sex-determination system is a sex-determination system present in many mammals, including humans, some insects (&quot;Drosophila&quot;), some snakes, some fish (guppies), and some plants (&quot;Ginkgo&quot; tree). 

In this system, the sex of an individual usually is determined by a pair of sex chromosomes. Typically, females have two of the same kind of sex chromosome (XX), and are called the homogametic sex. Males typically have two different kinds of sex chromosomes (XY), and are called the heterogametic sex. In humans, the presence of the Y chromosome is responsible for triggering male development; in the absence of the Y chromosome, the fetus will undergo female development. In most species with XY sex determination, an organism must have at least one X chromosome in order to survive.

The XY system contrasts in several ways with the ZW sex-determination system found in birds, some insects, many reptiles, and various other animals, in which the heterogametic sex is female. A temperature-dependent sex determination system is found in some reptiles and fish.

== Mechanisms ==
All animals have a set of DNA coding for genes present on chromosomes. In humans, most mammals, and some other species, two of the chromosomes, called the X chromosome and Y chromosome, code for sex. In these species, one or more genes are present on their Y chromosome that determine maleness. In this process, an X chromosome and a Y chromosome act to determine the sex of offspring, often due to genes located on the Y chromosome that code for maleness. Offspring have two sex chromosomes: an offspring with two X chromosomes (XX) will develop female characteristics, and an offspring with an X and a Y chromosome (XY) will develop male characteristics, except in various exceptions such as individuals with Swyer syndrome, that have XY chromosomes and a female phenotype, and de la Chapelle Syndrome, that have XX chromosomes and a male phenotype, however these exceptions are rare. In one instance, a seemingly normal female with a vagina, cervix, and ovaries had XY chromosomes, however the details and mechanism behind this is unknown, and could potentially be due to chimerism.

=== Mammals ===
In most mammals, sex is determined by presence of the Y chromosome. This makes individuals with XXY and XYY karyotypes males, and individuals with X and XXX karyotypes females.

In the 1930s, Alfred Jost determined that the presence of testosterone was required for Wolffian duct development in the male rabbit.

SRY is a sex-determining gene on the Y chromosome in the therians (placental mammals and marsupials). Non-human mammals use several genes on the Y chromosome.

Not all male-specific genes are located on the Y chromosome. The platypus, a monotreme, use five pairs of different XY chromosomes with six groups of male-linked genes, AMH being the master switch.

====Humans====

A single gene (&quot;SRY&quot;) present on the Y chromosome acts as a signal to set the developmental pathway towards maleness. Presence of this gene starts off the process of virilization. This and other factors result in the sex differences in humans. The cells in females, with two X chromosomes, undergo X-inactivation, in which one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated. The inactivated X chromosome remains within a cell as a Barr body.

===Other animals===
Some species of turtles have convergently evolved XY sex determination systems, specifically those in Chelidae and Staurotypinae.

Other species (including most &quot;Drosophila&quot; species) use the presence of two X chromosomes to determine femaleness: one X chromosome gives putative maleness, but the presence of Y chromosome genes is required for normal male development. In the fruit fly individuals with XY are male and individuals with XX are female; however, individuals with XXY or XXX can also be female, and individuals with X can be males.

=== Plants ===

==== Angiosperms ====
While very few species of dioecious angiosperm have XY sex determination, making up less than 5% of all species, the sheer diversity of angiosperms means that the total number of species with XY sex determination is actually quite high, estimated to be at around 13,000 species. Molecular and evolutionary studies also show that XY sex determination has evolved independently many times in upwards of 175 unique families, with a recent study suggesting its evolution has independently occurred hundreds to thousands of times. 

Many economically important crops are known to have an XY system of sex determination, including kiwifruit, asparagus, grapes and date palms.

==== Gymnosperms ====
In sharp contrast to angiosperms, approximately 65% of gymnosperms are dioecious. Some families which contain members that are known to have a XY system of sex determination include the cycad families Cycadaceae and Zamiaceae, Ginkgoaceae, Gnetaceae and Podocarpaceae.

===Other systems===
Whilst XY sex determination is the most familiar, since it is the system that humans use, there are a range of alternative systems found in nature. The inverse of the XY system (called &quot;ZW&quot; to distinguish it) is used in birds and many insects, in which it is the females that are heterogametic (ZW), while males are homogametic (ZZ). 

Many insects of the order Hymenoptera instead have a &quot;haplo-diploid&quot; system, where the females are full diploids (with all chromosomes appearing in pairs) but males are haploid (having just one copy of all chromosomes). Some other insects have the &quot;X0 sex-determination system&quot;, where just the sex-determining chromosome varies in ploidy (XX in females but X in males), while all other chromosomes appear in pairs in both sexes.

==Influences==

===Genetic===

In an interview for the &quot;Rediscovering Biology&quot; website, researcher Eric Vilain described how the paradigm changed since the discovery of the SRY gene:
In an interview by &quot;Scientific American&quot; in 2007, Vilian was asked: &quot;It sounds as if you are describing a shift from the prevailing view that female development is a default molecular pathway to active pro-male and antimale pathways. Are there also pro-female and antifemale pathways?&quot; He replied:

In mammals, including humans, the SRY gene triggers the development of non-differentiated gonads into testes rather than ovaries. However, there are cases in which testes can develop in the absence of an SRY gene (see sex reversal). In these cases, the SOX9 gene, involved in the development of testes, can induce their development without the aid of SRY. In the absence of SRY and SOX9, no testes can develop and the path is clear for the development of ovaries. Even so, the absence of the SRY gene or the silencing of the SOX9 gene are not enough to trigger sexual differentiation of a fetus in the female direction. A recent finding suggests that ovary development and maintenance is an active process, regulated by the expression of a &quot;pro-female&quot; gene, FOXL2. In an interview for the &quot;TimesOnline&quot; edition, study co-author Robin Lovell-Badge explained the significance of the discovery:
==== Implications ====
Looking into the genetic determinants of human sex can have wide-ranging consequences. Scientists have been studying different sex determination systems in fruit flies and animal models to attempt an understanding of how the genetics of sexual differentiation can influence biological processes like reproduction, ageing and disease.

===Maternal===
In humans and many other species of animals, the father determines the sex of the child. In the XY sex-determination system, the female-provided ovum contributes an X chromosome and the male-provided sperm contributes either an X chromosome or a Y chromosome, resulting in female (XX) or male (XY) offspring, respectively.

Hormone levels in the male parent affect the sex ratio of sperm in humans. Maternal influences also impact which sperm are more likely to achieve conception.

Human ova, like those of other mammals, are covered with a thick translucent layer called the zona pellucida, which the sperm must penetrate to fertilize the egg. Once viewed simply as an impediment to fertilization, recent research indicates the zona pellucida may instead function as a sophisticated biological security system that chemically controls the entry of the sperm into the egg and protects the fertilized egg from additional sperm.

Recent research indicates that human ova may produce a chemical which appears to attract sperm and influence their swimming motion. However, not all sperm are positively impacted; some appear to remain uninfluenced and some actually move away from the egg.

Maternal influences may also be possible that affect sex determination in such a way as to produce fraternal twins equally weighted between one male and one female.

The time at which insemination occurs during the estrus cycle has been found to affect the sex ratio of the offspring of humans, cattle, hamsters, and other mammals. Hormonal and pH conditions within the female reproductive tract vary with time, and this affects the sex ratio of the sperm that reach the egg.

Sex-specific mortality of embryos also occurs.

== History ==

=== Ancient ideas on sex determination ===
Aristotle believed incorrectly that the sex of an infant is determined by how much heat a man&#x27;s sperm had during insemination. He wrote:

Aristotle claimed in error that the male principle was the driver behind sex determination, such that if the male principle was insufficiently expressed during reproduction, the fetus would develop as a female.

=== 20th century genetics ===
Nettie Stevens (working with beetles) and Edmund Beecher Wilson (working with hemiptera) are credited with independently discovering, in 1905, the chromosomal XY sex-determination system in insects: the fact that males have XY sex chromosomes and females have XX sex chromosomes. In the early 1920s, Theophilus Painter demonstrated that sex in humans (and other mammals) was also determined by the X and Y chromosomes, and the chromosomes that make this determination are carried by the spermatozoa.

The first clues to the existence of a factor that determines the development of testis in mammals came from experiments carried out by Alfred Jost, who castrated embryonic rabbits in utero and noticed that they all acquired a female phenotype.

In 1959, C. E. Ford and his team, in the wake of Jost&#x27;s experiments, discovered that the Y chromosome was needed for a fetus to develop as male when they examined patients with Turner&#x27;s syndrome, who grew up as phenotypic females, and found them to be X0 (hemizygous for X and no Y). At the same time, Jacob &amp; Strong described a case of a patient with Klinefelter syndrome (XXY), which implicated the presence of a Y chromosome in development of maleness.

All these observations led to a consensus that a dominant gene that determines testis development (TDF) must exist on the human Y chromosome. The search for this testis-determining factor (TDF) led to Peter Goodfellow&#x27;s team of scientists in 1990 to discover a region of the Y chromosome that is necessary for the male sex determination, which was named SRY (sex-determining region of the Y chromosome).

<text>A window is an opening in a wall, door, roof, or vehicle that allows the exchange of light and may also allow the passage of sound and sometimes air. Modern windows are usually glazed or covered in some other transparent or translucent material, a sash set in a frame in the opening; the sash and frame are also referred to as a window. Many glazed windows may be opened, to allow ventilation, or closed to exclude inclement weather. Windows may have a latch or similar mechanism to lock the window shut or to hold it open by various amounts.

Types include the eyebrow window, fixed windows, hexagonal windows, single-hung, and double-hung sash windows, horizontal sliding sash windows, casement windows, awning windows, hopper windows, tilt, and slide windows (often door-sized), tilt and turn windows, transom windows, sidelight windows, jalousie or louvered windows, clerestory windows, lancet windows, skylights, roof windows, roof lanterns, bay windows, oriel windows, thermal, or Diocletian, windows, picture windows, rose windows, emergency exit windows, stained glass windows, French windows, panel windows, double/triple-paned windows, and witch windows.

== Etymology ==
The English language-word &quot;window&quot; originates from the Old Norse , from &#x27;wind&#x27; and &#x27;eye&#x27;. In Norwegian, Nynorsk, and Icelandic, the Old Norse form has survived to this day (in Icelandic only as a less used word for a type of small open &quot;window&quot;, not strictly a synonym for , the Icelandic word for &#x27;window&#x27;). In Swedish, the word remains as a term for a hole through the roof of a hut, and in the Danish language and Norwegian , the direct link to &quot;eye&quot; is lost, just as for &quot;window&quot;. The Danish (but not the ) word is pronounced fairly similarly to &quot;window&quot;.

&quot;Window&quot; is first recorded in the early 13th century, and originally referred to an unglazed hole in a roof. &quot;Window&quot; replaced the Old English , which literally means &#x27;eye-hole&#x27;, and &#x27;eye-door&#x27;. Many Germanic languages, however, adopted the Latin word to describe a window with glass, such as standard Swedish , or German . The use of &quot;window&quot; in English is probably because of the Scandinavian influence on the English language by means of loanwords during the Viking Age. In English, the word &quot;fenester&quot; was used as a parallel until the mid-18th century. &quot;Fenestration&quot; is still used to describe the arrangement of windows within a façade, as well as &quot;defenestration&quot;, meaning &#x27;to throw out of a window&#x27;.

== History ==

The Romans were the first known to use glass for windows, a technology likely first produced in Roman Egypt, in Alexandria AD. Presentations of windows can be seen in ancient Egyptian wall art and sculptures from Assyria. Paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient China, Korea, and Japan. In England, glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early 17th century whereas windows made up of panes of flattened animal horn were used as early as the 14th century. In the 19th century American west, greased paper windows came to be used by pioneering settlers. Modern-style floor-to-ceiling windows became possible only after the industrial plate glass making processes were fully perfected.

=== Technologies ===
In the 13th century BC, the earliest windows were unglazed openings in a roof to admit light during the day. Later, windows were covered with animal hide, cloth, or wood. Shutters that could be opened and closed came next. Over time, windows were built that both protected the inhabitants from the elements and transmitted light, using multiple small pieces of translucent material, such as flattened pieces of translucent animal horn, paper sheets, thin slices of marble (such as fengite), or pieces of glass, set in frameworks of wood, iron or lead. In the Far East, paper was used to fill windows.
The Romans were the first known users of glass for windows, exploiting a technology likely first developed in Roman Egypt. Specifically, in Alexandria 100 CE, cast-glass windows, albeit with poor optical properties, began to appear, but these were small thick productions, little more than blown-glass jars (cylindrical shapes) flattened out into sheets with circular striation patterns throughout. It would be over a millennium before window glass became transparent enough to see through clearly, as we expect now. In 1154, Al-Idrisi described glass windows as a feature of the palace belonging to the king of the Ghana Empire.

Over the centuries techniques were developed to shear through one side of a blown glass cylinder and produce thinner rectangular window panes from the same amount of glass material. This gave rise to tall narrow windows, usually separated by a vertical support called a mullion. Mullioned glass windows were the windows of choice among the European well-to-do, whereas paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient China, Korea, and Japan. In England, glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early-17th century, whereas windows made up of panes of flattened animal horn were used as early as the 14th century.

Modern-style floor-to-ceiling windows became possible only after the industrial plate glass-making processes were perfected in the late 19th century Modern windows are usually filled using glass, although transparent plastic is also used.

===Fashions and trends===
The introduction of lancet windows into Western European church architecture from the 12th century CE built on a tradition of arched windows inserted between columns, and led not only to tracery and elaborate stained-glass windows but also to a long-standing motif of pointed or rounded window-shapes in ecclesiastical buildings, still seen in many churches today.

Peter Smith discusses overall trends in early-modern rural Welsh window architecture:

Up to about 1680 windows tended to be horizontal in proportion, a shape suitable for lighting the low-ceilinged rooms that had resulted from the insertion of the upper floor into the hall-house. After that date vertically proportioned windows came into fashion, partly at least as a response to the Renaissance taste for the high ceiling. Since 1914 the wheel has come full circle and a horizontally proportioned window is again favoured.
The spread of plate-glass technology made possible the introduction of picture windows (in Levittown, Pennsylvania, founded 1951–1952).

Many modern day windows may have a window screen or mesh, often made of aluminum or fibreglass, to keep bugs out when the window is opened. Windows are primarily designed to facilitate a vital connection with the outdoors, offering those within the confines of the building visual access to the everchanging events occurring outside. The provision of this connection serves as an integral safeguard for the health and well-being of those inhabiting buildings, lest they experience the detrimental effects of enclosed buildings devoid of windows. Among the myriad criteria for the design of windows, several pivotal criteria have emerged in daylight standards: location, time, weather, nature, and people. Of these criteria, windows that are designed to provide views of nature are considered to be the most important by people.

== Types ==
=== Cross ===
A cross-window is a rectangular window usually divided into four lights by a mullion and transom that form a Latin cross.

=== Eyebrow ===
The term &quot;eyebrow window&quot; is used in two ways: a curved top window in a wall or an eyebrow dormer; and a row of small windows usually under the front eaves such as the James-Lorah House in Pennsylvania.

=== Fixed ===
A &quot;fixed window&quot; is a window that cannot be opened, whose function is limited to allowing light to enter (unlike an unfixed window, which can open and close). Clerestory windows in church architecture are often fixed. Transom windows may be fixed or operable. This type of window is used in situations where light or vision alone is needed as no ventilation is possible in such windows without the use of trickle vents or overglass vents.

=== Single-hung sash ===
A &quot;single-hung sash window&quot; is a window that has one sash that is movable (usually the bottom one) and the other fixed. This is the earlier form of sliding sash window and is also cheaper.

=== Double-hung sash ===
A sash window is the traditional style of window in the United Kingdom, and many other places that were formerly colonized by the UK, with two parts (sashes) that overlap slightly and slide up and down inside the frame. The two parts are not necessarily the same size; where the upper sash is smaller (shorter) it is termed a cottage window. Currently, most new double-hung sash windows use spring balances to support the sashes, but traditionally, counterweights held in boxes on either side of the window were used. These were and are attached to the sashes using pulleys of either braided cord or, later, purpose-made chain. Three types of spring balances are called a tape or clock spring balance; channel or block-and-tackle balance, and a spiral or tube balance.

Double-hung sash windows were traditionally often fitted with shutters. Sash windows can be fitted with simplex hinges that let the window be locked into hinges on one side, while the rope on the other side is detached—so the window can be opened for fire escape or cleaning.

=== Foldup ===
A &quot;foldup&quot; has two equal sashes similar to a standard double-hung but folds upward allowing air to pass through nearly the full-frame opening. The window is balanced using either springs or counterbalances, similar to a double-hung. The sashes can be either offset to simulate a double-hung, or in-line. The inline versions can be made to fold inward or outward. The inward swinging foldup windows can have fixed screens, while the outward swinging ones require movable screens. The windows are typically used for screen rooms, kitchen pass-throughs, or egress.

=== Horizontal sliding sash ===
A &quot;horizontal sliding sash window&quot; has two or more sashes that overlap slightly but slide horizontally within the frame. In the UK, these are sometimes called Yorkshire sash windows, presumably because of their traditional use in that county.

=== Casement ===


A casement window is a window with a hinged sash that swings in or out like a door comprising either a side-hung, top-hung (also called &quot;awning window&quot;; see below), or occasionally bottom-hung sash or a combination of these types, sometimes with fixed panels on one or more sides of the sash. In the US, these are usually opened using a crank, but in parts of Europe, they tend to use projection friction stays and espagnolette locking. Formerly, plain hinges were used with a casement stay. Handing applies to casement windows to determine direction of swing; a casement window may be left-handed, right-handed, or double. The casement window is the dominant type now found in modern buildings in the UK and many other parts of Europe.

=== Awning ===
An &quot;awning window&quot; is a casement window that is hung horizontally, hinged on top, so that it swings outward like an awning. In addition to being used independently, they can be stacked, several in one opening, or combined with fixed glass. They are particularly useful for ventilation.

=== Hopper ===
A &quot;hopper window&quot; is a bottom-pivoting casement window that opens by tilting vertically, typically to the inside, resembling a hopper chute.

=== Pivot ===
A &quot;pivot window&quot; is a window hung on one hinge on each of two opposite sides which allows the window to revolve when opened. The hinges may be mounted top and bottom (Vertically Pivoted) or at each jamb (Horizontally Pivoted). The window will usually open initially to a restricted position for ventilation and, once released, fully reverse and lock again for safe cleaning from inside. Modern pivot hinges incorporate a friction device to hold the window open against its weight and may have restriction and reversed locking built-in. In the UK, where this type of window is most common, they were extensively installed in high-rise social housing.

=== Tilt and slide ===
A &quot;tilt and slide window&quot; is a window (more usually a door-sized window) where the sash tilts inwards at the top similar to a hopper window and then slides horizontally behind the fixed pane.

=== Tilt and turn ===
A &quot;tilt and turn window&quot; can both tilt inwards at the top or open inwards from hinges at the side. This is the most common type of window in Germany, its country of origin. It is also widespread in many other European countries. In Europe, it is usual for these to be of the &quot;turn first&quot; type. i.e. when the handle is turned to 90 degrees the window opens in the side hung mode. With the handle turned to 180 degrees the window opens in bottom hung mode. Most usually in the UK the windows will be &quot;tilt first&quot; i.e. bottom hung at 90 degrees for ventilation and side hung at 180 degrees for cleaning the outer face of the glass from inside the building.

=== Transom ===
A transom window is a window above a door. In an exterior door the transom window is often fixed, in an interior door, it can open either by hinges at top or bottom, or rotate on hinges. It provided ventilation before forced air heating and cooling. A fan-shaped transom is known as a fanlight, especially in the British Isles.

=== Side light ===
Windows beside a door or window are called side-, wing-, margen-lights, and flanking windows.

=== Jalousie window ===
Also known as a louvered window, the jalousie window consists of parallel slats of glass or acrylic that open and close like a Venetian blind, usually using a crank or a lever. They are used extensively in tropical architecture. A jalousie door is a door with a jalousie window.

=== Clerestory ===


A clerestory window is a window set in a roof structure or high in a wall, used for daylighting.

=== Skylight ===


A skylight is a window built into a roof structure. This type of window allows for natural daylight and moonlight.

=== Roof ===
A &quot;roof window&quot; is a sloped window used for daylighting, built into a roof structure. It is one of the few windows that could be used as an exit. Larger roof windows meet building codes for emergency evacuation.

=== Roof lantern ===
A roof lantern is a multi-paned glass structure, resembling a small building, built on a roof for day or moon light. Sometimes includes an additional clerestory. May also be called a cupola.

=== Bay ===


A bay window is a multi-panel window, with at least three panels set at different angles to create a protrusion from the wall line.

==== Oriel ====
An &quot;oriel window&quot; is a form of bay window. This form most often appears in Tudor-style houses and monasteries. It projects from the wall and does not extend to the ground. Originally a form of porch, they are often supported by brackets or corbels.

=== Thermal ===
Thermal, or Diocletian, windows are large semicircular windows (or niches) which are usually divided into three lights (window compartments) by two mullions. The central compartment is often wider than the two side lights on either side of it.

=== Picture ===
A &quot;picture window&quot; is a large fixed window in a wall, typically without glazing bars, or glazed with only perfunctory glazing bars (muntins) near the edge of the window. Picture windows provide an unimpeded view, as if framing a picture.

=== Multi-lite ===
A &quot;multi-lite window&quot; is a window glazed with small panes of glass separated by wooden or lead &quot;glazing bars&quot;, or &quot;muntins&quot;, arranged in a decorative &quot;glazing pattern&quot; often dictated by the building&#x27;s architectural style. Due to the historic unavailability of large panes of glass, the multi-lit (or &quot;lattice window&quot;) was the most common window style until the beginning of the 20th century, and is still used in traditional architecture.

=== Emergency exit/egress ===
An &quot;emergency exit window&quot; is a window big enough and low enough so that occupants can escape through the opening in an emergency, such as a fire. In many countries, exact specifications for emergency windows in bedrooms are given in many building codes. Specifications for such windows may also allow for the entrance of emergency rescuers. Vehicles, such as buses, aircraft, and trains frequently have emergency exit windows as well.

=== Stained glass ===

A stained glass window is a window composed of pieces of colored glass, transparent, translucent or opaque, frequently portraying persons or scenes. Typically the glass in these windows is separated by lead glazing bars. Stained glass windows were popular in Victorian houses and some Wrightian houses, and are especially common in churches.

=== French ===
A French door has two rows of upright rectangular glass panes (lights) extending its full length; and two of these doors on an exterior wall and without a mullion separating them, that open outward with opposing hinges to a terrace or porch, are referred to as a French window. Sometimes these are set in pairs or multiples thereof along the exterior wall of a very large room, but often, one French window is placed centrally in a typically sized room, perhaps among other fixed windows flanking the feature. French windows are known as &quot;porte-fenêtre&quot; in France and &quot;portafinestra&quot; in Italy, and frequently are used in modern houses.

=== Double-paned ===


&quot;Double-paned windows&quot; have two parallel panes (slabs of glass) with a separation of typically about 1 cm; this space is permanently sealed and filled at the time of manufacture with dry air or other dry nonreactive gas. Such windows provide a marked improvement in thermal insulation (and usually in acoustic insulation as well) and are resistant to fogging and frosting caused by temperature differential. They are widely used for residential and commercial construction in intemperate climates. In the UK, double-paned and triple-paned are referred to as double-glazing and triple-glazing. Triple-paned windows are now a common type of glazing in central to northern Europe. Quadruple glazing is now being introduced in Scandinavia.

=== Hexagonal window ===


A hexagonal window is a hexagon-shaped window, resembling a bee cell or crystal lattice of graphite. The window can be vertically or horizontally oriented, openable or dead. It can also be regular or elongately-shaped and can have a separator (mullion). Typically, the cellular window is used for an attic or as a decorative feature, but it can also be a major architectural element to provide the natural lighting inside buildings.

=== Guillotine window ===
A &quot;guillotine window&quot; is a window that opens vertically. Guillotine windows have more than one sliding frame, and open from bottom to top or top to bottom.

== Terms ==
EN 12519 is the European standard that describes windows terms officially used in EU Member States. The main terms are:
* Light, or Lite, is the area between the outer parts of a window (transom, sill and jambs), usually filled with a glass pane. Multiple panes are divided by mullions when load-bearing, muntins when not.
* Lattice light is a compound window pane madeup of small pieces of glass held together in a lattice.
* Fixed window is a unit of one non-moving lite. The terms &quot;single-light&quot;, &quot;double-light&quot;, etc., refer to the number of these glass panes in a window.
* Sash unit is a window consisting of at least one sliding glass component, typically composed of two lites (known as a &quot;double-light&quot;).
* Replacement window in the United States means a framed window designed to slip inside the original window frame from the inside after the old sashes are removed. In Europe, it usually means a complete window including a replacement outer frame.
* New construction window, in the US, means a window with a nailing fin that is inserted into a rough opening from the outside before applying siding and inside trim. A nailing fin is a projection on the outer frame of the window in the same plane as the glazing, which overlaps the prepared opening, and can thus be &#x27;nailed&#x27; into place. In the UK and mainland Europe, windows in new-build houses are usually fixed with long screws into expanding plastic plugs in the brickwork. A gap of up to 13 mm is left around all four sides, and filled with expanding polyurethane foam. This makes the window fixing weatherproof but allows for expansion due to heat.
* Lintel is a beam over the top of a window, also known as a transom.
* Window sill is the bottom piece in a window frame. Window sills slant outward to drain water away from the inside of the building.
* Secondary glazing is an additional frame applied to the inside of an existing frame, usually used on protected or listed buildings to achieve higher levels of thermal and sound insulation without compromising the look of the building
* Decorative millwork is the moulding, cornices and lintels often decorating the surrounding edges of the window.

=== Labeling ===
The United States NFRC Window Label lists the following terms:
* Thermal transmittance (U-factor), best values are around U-0.15 (equal to 0.8 W/m2/K)
* Solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC), ratio of solar heat (infrared) passing through the glass to incident solar heat
* Visible transmittance (VT), ratio of transmitted visible light divided by incident visible light
* Air leakage (AL), measured in cubic foot per minute per linear foot of crack between sash and frame
* Condensation resistance (CR), measured between 1 and 100 (the higher the number, the higher the resistance of the formation of condensation)

The European harmonised standard hEN 14351–1, which deals with doors and windows, defines 23 characteristics (divided into &quot;essential&quot; and &quot;non essential&quot;). Two other, preliminary European Norms that are under development deal with internal pedestrian doors (prEN 14351–2), smoke and fire resisting doors, and openable windows (prEN 16034).

== Construction ==


Windows can be a significant source of heat transfer. Therefore, insulated glazing units consist of two or more panes to reduce the transfer of heat.

=== Grids or muntins ===

These are the pieces of framing that separate a larger window into smaller panes. In older windows, large panes of glass were quite expensive, so muntins let smaller panes fill a larger space. In modern windows, light-colored muntins still provide a useful function by reflecting some of the light going through the window, making the window itself a source of diffuse light (instead of just the surfaces and objects illuminated within the room). By increasing the indirect illumination of surfaces near the window, muntins tend to brighten the area immediately around a window and reduce the contrast of shadows within the room.

=== Frame and sash construction ===

Frames and sashes can be made of the following materials:

Composites (also known as Hybrid Windows) are start since early 1998 and combine materials like aluminium + pvc or wood to obtain aesthetics of one material with the functional benefits of another.

A special class of PVC window frames, uPVC window frames, became widespread since the late 20th century, particularly in Europe: there were 83.5 million installed by 1998 with numbers still growing as of 2012.

=== Glazing and filling ===

Low-emissivity coated panes reduce heat transfer by radiation, which, depending on which surface is coated, helps prevent heat loss (in cold climates) or heat gains (in warm climates).

High thermal resistance can be obtained by evacuating or filling the insulated glazing units with gases such as argon or krypton, which reduces conductive heat transfer due to their low thermal conductivity. Performance of such units depends on good window seals and meticulous frame construction to prevent entry of air and loss of efficiency.

Modern double-pane and triple-pane windows often include one or more low-e coatings to reduce the window&#x27;s U-factor (its insulation value, specifically its rate of heat loss). In general, soft-coat low-e coatings tend to result in a lower solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) than hard-coat low-e coatings.

Modern windows are usually glazed with one large sheet of glass per sash, while windows in the past were glazed with multiple panes separated by &quot;glazing bars&quot;, or &quot;muntins&quot;, due to the unavailability of large sheets of glass. Today, glazing bars tend to be decorative, separating windows into small panes of glass even though larger panes of glass are available, generally in a pattern dictated by the architectural style at use. Glazing bars are typically wooden, but occasionally lead glazing bars soldered in place are used for more intricate glazing patterns.

=== Other construction details ===

Many windows have movable window coverings such as blinds or curtains to keep out light, provide additional insulation, or ensure privacy.
Windows allow natural light to enter, but too much can have negative effects such as glare and heat gain. Additionally, while windows let the user see outside, there must be a way to maintain privacy on in the inside. Window coverings are practical accommodations for these issues.

== Impact of the sun ==
=== Sun incidence angle ===

Historically, windows are designed with surfaces parallel to vertical building walls. Such a design allows considerable solar light and heat penetration due to the most commonly occurring incidence of sun angles. In passive solar building design, an extended eave is typically used to control the amount of solar light and heat entering the window(s).

An alternative method is to calculate an optimum window mounting angle that accounts for summer sun load minimization, with consideration of actual latitude of the building. This process has been implemented, for example, in the Dakin Building in Brisbane, California—in which most of the fenestration is designed to reflect summer heat load and help prevent summer interior over-illumination and glare, by canting windows to nearly a 45 degree angle.

=== Solar window ===
Photovoltaic windows not only provide a clear view and illuminate rooms, but also convert sunlight to electricity for the building. In most cases, translucent photovoltaic cells are used.

=== Passive solar ===
&quot;Passive solar windows&quot; allow light and solar energy into a building while minimizing air leakage and heat loss. Properly positioning these windows in relation to sun, wind, and landscape—while properly shading them to limit excess heat gain in summer and shoulder seasons, and providing thermal mass to absorb energy during the day and release it when temperatures cool at night—increases comfort and energy efficiency. Properly designed in climates with adequate solar gain, these can even be a building&#x27;s primary heating system.

=== Coverings ===

A window covering is a shade or screen that provides multiple functions. Some coverings, such as drapes and blinds provide occupants with privacy. Some window coverings control solar heat gain and glare. There are external shading devices and internal shading devices. Low-e window film is a low-cost alternative to window replacement to transform existing poorly-insulating windows into energy-efficient windows. For high-rise buildings, smart glass can provide an alternative.

<doc id="49401" wikidata="Q240854" url="?curid=49401" title="Hall">
<text>In architecture, a hall is a relatively large space enclosed by a roof and walls. In the Iron Age and early Middle Ages in northern Europe, a mead hall was where a lord and his retainers ate and also slept. Later in the Middle Ages, the great hall was the largest room in castles and large houses, and where the servants usually slept. As more complex house plans developed, the hall remained a large room for dancing and large feasts, often still with servants sleeping there. It was usually immediately inside the main door. In modern British houses, an entrance hall next to the front door remains an indispensable feature, even if it is essentially merely a corridor.

Today, the (entrance) hall of a house is the space next to the front door or vestibule leading to the rooms directly and/or indirectly. Where the hall inside the front door of a house is elongated, it may be called a passage, corridor (from Spanish &quot;corredor&quot; used in El Escorial and 100 years later in Castle Howard), or hallway.

==History==
In warmer climates, the houses of the wealthy were often built around a courtyard, but in northern areas manors were built around a great hall. The hall was home to the hearth and was where all the residents of the house would eat, work, and sleep. One common example of this form is the longhouse. Only particularly messy tasks would be done in separate rooms on the periphery of the hall. Still today the term &quot;hall&quot; is often used to designate a country house such as a hall house, or specifically a Wealden hall house, and manor houses.

In later medieval Europe, the main room of a castle or manor house was the great hall. In a medieval building, the hall was where the fire was kept. As heating technology improved and a desire for privacy grew, tasks moved from the hall to other rooms. First, the master of the house withdrew to private bedrooms and eating areas. Over time servants and children also moved to their own areas, while work projects were also given their own chambers leaving the hall for special functions. With time, its functions as dormitory, kitchen, parlour, and so on were divided into separate rooms or, in the case of the kitchen, a separate building.

Until the early modern era that majority of the population lived in houses with a single room. In the 17th century, even lower classes began to have a second room, with the main chamber being the hall and the secondary room the parlor. The hall and parlor house was found in England and was a fundamental, historical floor plan in parts of the United States from 1620 to 1860.

In Europe, as the wealthy embraced multiple rooms initially the common form was the enfilade, with rooms directly connecting to each other. In 1597 John Thorpe is the first recorded architect to replace multiple connected rooms with rooms along a corridor each accessed by a separate door.

==Other uses==
===Collegiate halls===
Many institutions and buildings at colleges and universities are formally titled &quot;_______ Hall&quot;, typically being named after the person who endowed it, for example, King&#x27;s Hall, Cambridge. Others, such as Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, commemorate respected people. Between these in age, Nassau Hall at Princeton University began as the single building of the then college. In medieval origin, these were the halls in which the members of the university lived together during term time. In many cases, some aspect of this community remains.

Some of these institutions are titled &quot;Hall&quot; instead of &quot;College&quot; because at the time of their foundation they were not recognised as colleges (in some cases because their foundation predated the existence of colleges) and did not have the appropriate Royal Charter. Examples at the University of Oxford are:

* St Edmund Hall
* Hart Hall (now Hertford College)
* Lady Margaret Hall
* The (currently six) Permanent private halls.

In colleges of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the term &quot;Hall&quot; is also used for the dining hall for students, with High Table at one end for fellows. Typically, at &quot;Formal Hall&quot;, gowns are worn for dinner during the evening, whereas for &quot;informal Hall&quot; they are not. The medieval collegiate dining hall, with a dais for the high table at the upper end and a screen passage at the lower end, is a modified or assimilated form of the Great hall.

===Meeting hall===

A hall is also a building consisting largely of a principal room, that is rented out for meetings and social affairs. It may be privately or government-owned, such as a function hall owned by one company used for weddings and cotillions (organized and run by the same company on a contractual basis) or a community hall available for rent to anyone, such as a British village hall.

===Religious halls===
In religious architecture, as in Islamic architecture, the prayer hall is a large room dedicated to the practice of worship. (example: the prayer hall of the Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia). A hall church is a church with a nave and side aisles of approximately equal height. Many churches have an associated church hall used for meetings and other events.

===Public buildings===
Following a line of similar development, in office buildings and larger buildings (theatres, cinemas etc.), the entrance hall is generally known as the foyer (the French for fireplace). The atrium, a name sometimes used in public buildings for the entrance hall, was the central courtyard of a Roman house.

==Types==

In architecture, the term &quot;double-loaded&quot; describes corridors that connect to rooms on both sides. Conversely, a single-loaded corridor only has rooms on one side (and possible windows on the other). A blind corridor does not lead anywhere.

*Billiard hall
*City hall, town hall or village hall
*Concert hall
*Concourse (at a large transportation station)
*Convention center (exhibition hall)
*Dance hall
*Dining hall
*Firehall
*Great room or great hall
*Moot hall
*Prayer hall, such as the sanctuary of a synagogue
*Reading room
*Residence hall
*Trades hall (also called union hall, labour hall, etc.)
*Waiting room (in large transportation stations)

<text>A closet (especially in North American English usage) is an enclosed space, with a door, used for storage, particularly that of clothes. &quot;Fitted closets&quot; are built into the walls of the house so that they take up no apparent space in the room. Closets are often built under stairs, thereby using awkward space that would otherwise go unused.

A piece of furniture such as a cabinet or chest of drawers serves the same purpose of storage, but is not a closet, which is an architectural feature rather than a piece of furniture. A closet always has space for hanging, where a cupboard may consist only of shelves for folded garments. &quot;Wardrobe&quot; can refer to a free-standing piece of furniture (also known as an &quot;armoire&quot;), but according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, a wardrobe can also be a &quot;large cupboard or cabinet for storing clothes or other linen&quot;, including &quot;built-in wardrobe, fitted wardrobe, walk-in wardrobe, etc.&quot;

==Other uses of the word==
In Elizabethan and Middle English, &quot;closet&quot; referred to a small private room, an inner sanctum within a far larger house, used for prayer, reading, or study. 

The use of &quot;closet&quot; for &quot;toilet&quot; dates back to 1662. In Indian English, this use continues. Related forms include earth closet and water closet (flush toilet). &quot;Privy&quot; meaning an outhouse derives from &quot;private&quot;, making the connection with the Middle English use of &quot;closet&quot;, above.

== Types==

*Airing cupboard: A closet containing a water heater, with slatted shelves to allow air to circulate around the clothes or linen stored there. 
* Broom closet: A closet with top-to-bottom space used for storing cleaning items, like brooms, mops, vacuum cleaners, cleaning supplies, buckets, etc.
* Coat closet: A closet located near the front door. Usually used to store coats, jackets, hoodies, sweatshirts, gloves, hats, scarfs, sunglasses, and boots/shoes. This kind of closet sometimes has shelving. It only has a rod and some bottom space used for clothes stored in boxes or drawers. Some may have a top shelf for storage above the rod.
*Custom closet: A closet that is made specifically to meet the needs of the user, like a kids closet.
* Linen-press or linen closet: A tall, narrow closet. Typically located in or near bathrooms and/or bedrooms, such a closet contains shelves used to hold items such as toiletries and linens, including towels, washcloths, or sheets.
*Pantry: A closet or cabinet in a kitchen used for storing food, dishes, linens, and provisions. The closet may have shelves for putting food on.
* Spear closet: A closet made to use up otherwise unused space in a building.
*Supply closet: A closet most commonly used for storing office supplies.
* Utility closet: A closet most commonly used for storing house appliances and cleaning supplies
* Walk-in closet: A storage room with enough space for someone to stand in it while accessing stored items. Larger ones used for clothes shade into dressing room.
* Wall closet: A closet in a bedroom that is built into the wall. It may be closed by curtains or folding doors, in which clothes can be stored folded on shelves.
* Wardrobe: A small closet used for storing clothes.

==Closet tax question in colonial America==
Though some sources claim that colonial American houses often lacked closets because of a &quot;closet tax&quot; imposed by the British crown, others argue that closets were absent in most houses simply because their residents had few possessions.

==Closet organizers==
Closet organizers are integrated shelving systems. Different materials have advantages and disadvantages:
* Wire shelving: Moderately difficult to install, wire shelves cannot hold much weight without giving in but are cheap.
* Wood shelving: Difficult to install, wood shelving is sturdier and more expensive than wire.
* Tube shelving: Easy to install, tube shelving involves few pieces and requires no cutting or measuring.

<text>A kitchen is a room or part of a room used for cooking and food preparation in a dwelling or in a commercial establishment. A modern middle-class residential kitchen is typically equipped with a stove, a sink with hot and cold running water, a refrigerator, and worktops and kitchen cabinets arranged according to a modular design. Many households have a microwave oven, a dishwasher, and other electric appliances. The main functions of a kitchen are to store, prepare and cook food (and to complete related tasks such as dishwashing). The room or area may also be used for dining (or small meals such as breakfast), entertaining and laundry. The design and construction of kitchens is a huge market all over the world.

Commercial kitchens are found in restaurants, cafeterias, hotels, hospitals, educational and workplace facilities, army barracks, and similar establishments. These kitchens are generally larger and equipped with bigger and more heavy-duty equipment than a residential kitchen. For example, a large restaurant may have a huge walk-in refrigerator and a large commercial dishwasher machine. In some instances, commercial kitchen equipment such as commercial sinks is used in household settings as it offers ease of use for food preparation and high durability.

In developed countries, commercial kitchens are generally subject to public health laws. They are inspected periodically by public-health officials, and forced to close if they do not meet hygienic requirements mandated by law.

Early medieval European longhouses had an open fire under the highest point of the building. The &quot;kitchen area&quot; was between the entrance and the fireplace. In wealthy homes, there was typically more than one kitchen. In some homes, there were upwards of three kitchens. The kitchens were divided based on the types of food prepared in them.

The kitchen might be separate from the great hall due to the smoke from cooking fires and the chance the fires may get out of control. Few medieval kitchens survive as they were &quot;notoriously ephemeral structures&quot;.

===Colonial America===
In Connecticut, as in other colonies of New England during Colonial America, kitchens were often built as separate rooms and were located behind the parlor and keeping room or dining room. One early record of a kitchen is found in the 1648 inventory of the estate of a John Porter of Windsor, Connecticut. The inventory lists goods in the house &quot;over the kittchin&quot; and &quot;in the kittchin&quot;. The items listed in the kitchen were: silver spoons, pewter, brass, iron, arms, ammunition, hemp, flax and &quot;other implements about the room&quot;.

Technological developments such as the Rumford roaster and the kitchen range enabled more efficient use of space and fuel.

===Rationalization===
A stepping stone to the modern fitted kitchen was the Frankfurt Kitchen, designed by Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky for social housing projects in 1926. This kitchen measured , and was built to optimize kitchen efficiency and lower building costs. The design was the result of detailed time-motion studies and interviews with future tenants to identify what they needed from their kitchens. Schütte-Lihotzky&#x27;s fitted kitchen was built in some 10,000 apartments in housing projects erected in Frankfurt in the 1930s.

==Materials==
The Frankfurt Kitchen of 1926 was made of several materials depending on the application. The modern built-in kitchens of today use particle boards or MDF, decorated with a variety of materials and finishes including wood veneers, lacquer, glass, melamine, laminate, ceramic and eco gloss. Very few manufacturers produce home built-in kitchens from stainless steel. Until the 1950s, steel kitchens were used by architects, but this material was displaced by the cheaper particle board panels sometimes decorated with a steel surface.

==Domestic kitchen planning==

Domestic (or residential) kitchen design is a relatively recent discipline. The first ideas to optimize the work in the kitchen go back to Catharine Beecher&#x27;s &quot;A Treatise on Domestic Economy&quot; (1843, revised and republished together with her sister Harriet Beecher Stowe as &quot;The American Woman&#x27;s Home&quot; in 1869). Beecher&#x27;s &quot;model kitchen&quot; propagated for the first time a systematic design based on early ergonomics. The design included regular shelves on the walls, ample workspace, and dedicated storage areas for various food items. Beecher even separated the functions of preparing food and cooking it altogether by moving the stove into a compartment adjacent to the kitchen.

Christine Frederick published from 1913 a series of articles on &quot;New Household Management&quot; in which she analyzed the kitchen following Taylorist principles of efficiency, presented detailed time-motion studies, and derived a kitchen design from them. Her ideas were taken up in the 1920s by architects in Germany and Austria, most notably Bruno Taut, Erna Meyer, Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky and Benita Otte, who designed the first fitted kitchen for the Haus am Horn, which was completed in 1923. Similar design principles were employed by Schütte-Lihotzky for her famous Frankfurt kitchen, designed for Ernst May&#x27;s &quot;Römerstadt&quot;, a social housing project in Frankfurt, in 1927.

While this &quot;work kitchen&quot; and variants derived from it were a great success for tenement buildings, homeowners had different demands and did not want to be constrained by a kitchen. Nevertheless, the kitchen design was mostly ad-hoc following the whims of the architect. In the U.S., the &quot;Small Homes Council&quot;, since 1993 the &quot;Building Research Council&quot;, of the School of Architecture of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign was founded in 1944 with the goal to improve the state of the art in home building, originally with an emphasis on standardization for cost reduction. It was there that the notion of the &quot;kitchen work triangle&quot; was formalized: the three main functions in a kitchen are storage, preparation, and cooking (which Catharine Beecher had already recognized), and the places for these functions should be arranged in the kitchen in such a way that work at one place does not interfere with work at another place, the distance between these places is not unnecessarily large, and no obstacles are in the way. A natural arrangement is a triangle, with the refrigerator, the sink, and the stove at a vertex each.

This observation led to a few common kitchen forms, commonly characterized by the arrangement of the kitchen cabinets and sink, stove, and refrigerator:
* A &quot;single-file kitchen&quot; (also known as a one-way galley or a straight-line kitchen) has all of these along one wall; the work triangle degenerates to a line. This is not optimal, but often the only solution if space is restricted. This may be common in an attic space that is being converted into a living space, or a studio apartment.
* The &quot;double-file kitchen (or two-way galley)&quot; has two rows of cabinets on opposite walls, one containing the stove and the sink, the other the refrigerator. This is the classical work kitchen and makes efficient use of space.
* In the &quot;L-kitchen&quot;, the cabinets occupy two adjacent walls. Again, the work triangle is preserved, and there may even be space for an additional table at a third wall, provided it does not intersect the triangle.
* A &quot;U-kitchen&quot; has cabinets along three walls, typically with the sink at the base of the &quot;U&quot;. This is a typical work kitchen, too, unless the two other cabinet rows are short enough to place a table on the fourth wall.
* A &quot;G-kitchen&quot; has cabinets along three walls, like the U-kitchen, and also a partial fourth wall, often with a double basin sink at the corner of the G shape. The G-kitchen provides additional work and storage space and can support two work triangles. A modified version of the G-kitchen is the &quot;double-L&quot;, which splits the G into two L-shaped components, essentially adding a smaller L-shaped island or peninsula to the L-kitchen.

* The &quot;block kitchen (or island)&quot; is a more recent development, typically found in open kitchens. Here, the stove or both the stove and the sink are placed where an L or U kitchen would have a table, in a free-standing &quot;island&quot;, separated from the other cabinets. In a closed room, this does not make much sense, but in an open kitchen, it makes the stove accessible from all sides such that two persons can cook together, and allows for contact with guests or the rest of the family since the cook does not face the wall any more. Additionally, the kitchen island&#x27;s counter-top can function as an overflow surface for serving buffet-style meals or sitting down to eat breakfast and snacks.

In the 1980s, there was a backlash against industrial kitchen planning and cabinets with people installing a mix of work surfaces and free standing furniture, led by kitchen designer Johnny Grey and his concept of the &quot;unfitted kitchen&quot;. Modern kitchens often have enough informal space to allow for people to eat in it without having to use the formal dining room. Such areas are called &quot;breakfast areas&quot;, &quot;breakfast nooks&quot; or &quot;breakfast bars&quot; if space is integrated into a kitchen counter. Kitchens with enough space to eat in are sometimes called &quot;eat-in kitchens&quot;. During the 2000s, flat pack kitchens were popular for people doing DIY renovating on a budget. The flat pack kitchens industry makes it easy to put together and mix and matching doors, bench tops and cabinets. In flat pack systems, many components can be interchanged.

In larger homes, where the owners might have meals prepared by a household staff member, the home may have a &quot;chef&#x27;s kitchen&quot;. This typically differs from a normal domestic kitchen by having multiple ovens (possibly of different kinds for different kinds of cooking), multiple sinks, and warming drawers to keep food heated between cooking and service.

==Other types==
Restaurant and canteen kitchens found in hotels, hospitals, educational and workplace facilities, army barracks, and similar institutions are generally (in developed countries) subject to public health laws. They are inspected periodically by public health officials and forced to close if they do not meet hygienic requirements mandated by law.

Canteen kitchens (and castle kitchens) were often the places where new technology was used first. For instance, Benjamin Thompson&#x27;s &quot;energy saving stove&quot;, an early 19th-century fully closed iron stove using one fire to heat several pots, was designed for large kitchens; another thirty years passed before they were adapted for domestic use.

As of 2017, restaurant kitchens usually have tiled walls and floors and use stainless steel for other surfaces (workbench, but also door and drawer fronts) because these materials are durable and easy to clean. Professional kitchens are often equipped with gas stoves, as these allow cooks to regulate the heat more quickly and more finely than electrical stoves. Some special appliances are typical for professional kitchens, such as large installed deep fryers, steamers, or a bain-marie.

The fast food and convenience food trends have changed the manner in which restaurant kitchens operate. Some of these type restaurants may only &quot;finish&quot; convenience food that is delivered to them or just reheat completely prepared meals. At the most they may grill a hamburger or a steak. But in the early 21st century, c-stores (convenience stores) are attracting greater market share by performing more food preparation on-site and better customer service than some fast food outlets.

The kitchens in railway dining cars have presented special challenges: space is limited, and, personnel must be able to serve a great number of meals quickly. Especially in the early history of railways, this required flawless organization of processes; in modern times, the microwave oven and prepared meals have made this task much easier. Kitchens aboard ships, aircraft and sometimes railcars are often referred to as galleys. On yachts, galleys are often cramped, with one or two burners fueled by an LP gas bottle. Kitchens on cruise ships or large warships, by contrast, are comparable in every respect with restaurants or canteen kitchens.

On passenger airliners, the kitchen is reduced to a pantry. The crew&#x27;s role is to heat and serve in-flight meals delivered by a catering company. An extreme form of the kitchen occurs in space, &quot;e.g.&quot;, aboard a Space Shuttle (where it is also called the &quot;galley&quot;) or the International Space Station. The astronauts&#x27; food is generally completely prepared, dehydrated, and sealed in plastic pouches before the flight. The kitchen is reduced to a rehydration and heating module.

Outdoor areas where food is prepared are generally not considered kitchens, even though an outdoor area set up for regular food preparation, for instance when camping, might be referred to as an &quot;outdoor kitchen&quot;. An outdoor kitchen at a campsite might be placed near a well, water pump, or water tap, and it might provide tables for food preparation and cooking (using portable camp stoves). Some campsite kitchen areas have a large tank of propane connected to burners so that campers can cook their meals. Military camps and similar temporary settlements of nomads may have dedicated kitchen tents, which have a vent to enable cooking smoke to escape.

In schools where home economics, food technology (previously known as &quot;domestic science&quot;), or culinary arts are taught, there are typically a series of kitchens with multiple equipment (similar in some respects to laboratories) solely for the purpose of teaching. These consist of multiple workstations, each with its own oven, sink, and kitchen utensils, where the teacher can show students how to prepare food and cook it.

==By region==
===China===

Kitchens in China are called . More than 3000 years ago, the ancient Chinese used the ding for cooking food. The ding was developed into the wok and pot used today. In Chinese spiritual tradition, a Kitchen God watches over the kitchen for the family and reports to the Jade Emperor annually about the family&#x27;s behavior. On Chinese New Year&#x27;s Eve, families would gather to pray for the kitchen god to give a good report to heaven and wish him to bring back good news on the fifth day of the New Year. 
The most common cooking equipment in Chinese family kitchens and restaurant kitchens are woks, steamer baskets and pots. The fuel or heating resource was also an important technique to practice the cooking skills. Traditionally Chinese were using wood or straw as the fuel to cook food. A Chinese chef had to master flaming and heat radiation to reliably prepare traditional recipes. Chinese cooking will use a pot or wok for pan-frying, stir-frying, deep frying or boiling.

===Japan===

Kitchens in Japan are called Daidokoro (台所; lit. &quot;kitchen&quot;). Daidokoro is the place where food is prepared in a Japanese house. Until the Meiji era, a kitchen was also called &quot;kamado&quot; (かまど; lit. stove) and there are many sayings in the Japanese language that involve kamado as it was considered the symbol of a house and the term could even be used to mean &quot;family&quot; or &quot;household&quot; (similar to the English word &quot;hearth&quot;). When separating a family, it was called &quot;Kamado wo wakeru&quot;, which means &quot;divide the stove&quot;. &quot;Kamado wo yaburu&quot; (lit. &quot;break the stove&quot;) means that the family was bankrupt.

===India===
In India, a kitchen is called a &quot;Rasoi&quot; (in Hindi\Sanskrit) or a &quot;Swayampak ghar&quot; in Marathi, and there exist many other names for it in the various regional languages. Many different methods of cooking exist across the country, and the structure and the materials used in constructing kitchens have varied depending on the region. For example, in the north and central India, cooking used to be carried out in clay ovens called &quot;chulha&quot; (also &quot;chullha&quot; or &quot;chullah&quot;), fired by wood, coal or dried cow dung. In households where members observed vegetarianism, separate kitchens were maintained to cook and store vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. Religious families often treat the kitchen as a sacred space. Indian kitchens are built on an Indian architectural science called vastushastra. The Indian kitchen vastu is of utmost importance while designing kitchens in India. Modern-day architects also follow the norms of vastushastra while designing Indian kitchens across the world.

While many kitchens belonging to poor families continue to use clay stoves and the older forms of fuel, the urban middle and upper classes usually have gas stoves with cylinders or piped gas attached. Electric cooktops are rarer since they consume a great deal of electricity, but microwave ovens are gaining popularity in urban households and commercial enterprises. Indian kitchens are also supported by biogas and solar energy as fuel. World&#x27;s largest solar energy kitchen is built in India. In association with government bodies, India is encouraging domestic biogas plants to support the kitchen system.

<doc id="49407" wikidata="Q168707" url="?curid=49407" title="Pliny the Younger">
<text>Gaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus (born Gaius Caecilius or Gaius Caecilius Cilo; 61 – ), better known in English as Pliny the Younger ( ), was a lawyer, author, and magistrate of Ancient Rome. Pliny&#x27;s uncle, Pliny the Elder, helped raise and educate him.

Pliny the Younger wrote hundreds of letters, of which 247 survived, and which are of great historical value. Some are addressed to reigning emperors or to notables such as the historian Tacitus. Pliny served as an imperial magistrate under Trajan (reigned 98–117), and his letters to Trajan provide one of the few surviving records of the relationship between the imperial office and provincial governors.

Pliny rose through a series of civil and military offices, the &quot;cursus honorum&quot;. He was a friend of the historian Tacitus and might have employed the biographer Suetonius on his staff. Pliny also came into contact with other well-known men of the period, including the philosophers Artemidorus and Euphrates the Stoic, during his time in Syria.

==Background==

===Childhood===

Pliny the Younger was born in &quot;Novum Comum&quot; (Como, Northern Italy) around 61 AD, the son of Lucius Caecilius Cilo, born there, and his wife Plinia Marcella, a sister of Pliny the Elder. He was the grandson of Senator and landowner Gaius Caecilius, revered his uncle, who at this time was extremely famous around the Roman Empire because of his intelligence, and provided sketches of how his uncle worked on the &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot;.

Cilo died at an early age when Pliny was still young. As a result, the boy probably lived with his mother. His guardian and preceptor in charge of his education was Lucius Verginius Rufus, famed for quelling a revolt against Nero in 68 AD. After being first tutored at home, Pliny went to Rome for further education. There he was taught rhetoric by Quintilian, a great teacher and author, and Nicetes Sacerdos of Smyrna. It was at this time that Pliny became closer to his uncle Pliny the Elder. When Pliny the Younger was 17 or 18 in 79 AD, his uncle Pliny the Elder died attempting to rescue victims of the Vesuvius eruption, and the terms of the Elder Pliny&#x27;s will passed his estate to his nephew. In the same document, the younger Pliny was adopted by his uncle. As a result, Pliny the Younger changed his name from &quot;Gaius Caecilius Cilo&quot; to &quot;Gaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus&quot; (his official title was &quot;Gaius Plinius Luci filius Caecilius Secundus&quot;).

There is some evidence that Pliny had a sibling. A memorial erected in Como (now ) repeats the terms of a will by which the &quot;aedile&quot; Lucius Caecilius Cilo, son of Lucius, established a fund, the interest of which was to buy oil (used for soap) for the baths of the people of Como. The trustees are apparently named in the inscription: &quot;L. Caecilius Valens and P. Caecilius Secundus, sons of Lucius, and the &quot;contubernalis&quot; Lutulla.&quot; The word &quot;contubernalis&quot; describing Lutulla is the military term meaning &quot;tent-mate&quot;, which can only mean that she was living with Lucius, not as his wife. The first man mentioned, L. Caecilius Valens, is probably the older son. Pliny the Younger confirms that he was a trustee for the largesse &quot;of my ancestors&quot;. It seems unknown to Pliny the Elder, so Valens&#x27; mother was probably not his sister Plinia; perhaps Valens was Lutulla&#x27;s son from an earlier relationship.

===Marriages===
Pliny the Younger married three times: first, when he was very young (about 18), to a stepdaughter of Veccius Proculus, who died at age 37; secondly, at an unknown date, to the daughter of Pompeia Celerina; and thirdly to Calpurnia who was 14 at the time and 26 years younger then Pliny, daughter of Calpurnius and granddaughter of Calpurnius Fabatus of Comum. Letters survive in which Pliny recorded this last marriage taking place, his attachment to Calpurnia, and his sadness when she miscarried their child at the age of 17.

===Death===

Pliny is thought to have died suddenly during his convention in Bithynia-Pontus, around 113 AD, since no events referred to in his letters date later than that.

==Career==
Pliny was by birth of equestrian rank, that is, a member of the aristocratic order of &quot;equites&quot; (knights), the lower (beneath the senatorial order) of the two Roman aristocratic orders that monopolised senior civil and military offices during the early Empire. His career began at the age of 18 and initially followed a normal equestrian route. But, unlike most equestrians, he achieved entry into the upper order by being elected Quaestor in his late twenties. (See Career summary below.)

Pliny was active in the Roman legal system, especially in the sphere of the Roman centumviral court, which dealt with inheritance cases. Later, he was a well-known prosecutor and defender at the trials of a series of provincial governors, including Baebius Massa, governor of Baetica; Marius Priscus, governor of Africa; Gaius Caecilius Classicus, governor of Baetica; and most ironically in light of his later appointment to this province, Gaius Julius Bassus and Varenus Rufus, both governors of Bithynia and Pontus.

Pliny&#x27;s career is commonly considered as a summary of the main Roman public charges and is the best-documented example from this period, offering proof for many aspects of imperial culture. Effectively, Pliny crossed all the principal fields of the organization of the early Roman Empire. It is an achievement for a man to have not only survived the reigns of several disparate emperors, especially the much-detested Domitian, but also to have risen in rank throughout.

===Career summary===


==Writings==
Pliny wrote his first work, a tragedy in Greek, at age 14. Additionally, in the course of his life, he wrote numerous poems, most of which are lost. He was also known as a notable orator; though he professed himself a follower of Cicero, Pliny&#x27;s prose was more magniloquent and less direct than Cicero&#x27;s.

Pliny&#x27;s only oration that now survives is the &quot;Panegyricus Traiani&quot;. This was delivered in the Senate in 100 and is a description of Trajan&#x27;s figure and actions in an adulatory and emphatic form, especially contrasting him with the Emperor Domitian. It is, however, a relevant document that reveals many details about the Emperor&#x27;s actions in several fields of his administrative power such as taxes, justice, military discipline, and commerce. Recalling the speech in one of his letters, Pliny shrewdly defines his own motives thus:
===&quot;Epistulae&quot;===
The largest surviving body of Pliny&#x27;s work is his 247 &quot;Epistulae&quot;, letters to his friends and associates. These letters are a unique testimony of Roman administrative history and everyday life in the 1st century AD. Especially noteworthy among the letters are two in which he describes the eruption of Mount Vesuvius on August 24 in AD 79, during which his uncle Pliny the Elder died (&quot;Epistulae&quot; VI.16, VI.20), and one in which he asks the Emperor for instructions regarding official policy concerning Christians (&quot;Epistulae&quot; X.96).

====Epistles concerning the eruption of Mount Vesuvius====
Pliny wrote the two letters describing the eruption of Mount Vesuvius approximately 25 years after the event, and both were sent in response to the request of his friend, the historian Tacitus. The first letter outlines the events preceding the death of Pliny the Elder during the attempted rescue of his friend Rectina. The second letter details the Younger&#x27;s movements across the same period of time. The two letters have great historical value due to their accurate description of the Vesuvius eruption; Pliny&#x27;s attention to detail in the letters about Vesuvius is so keen that modern volcanologists describe those types of eruptions as &quot;Plinian eruptions&quot;.

====Epistle concerning the Christian religion====

 As the Roman governor of Bithynia-Pontus (now in modern Turkey) Pliny wrote a letter to Emperor Trajan around 112 AD and asked for counsel on dealing with Christians. In the letter (&quot;Epistulae&quot; X.96), Pliny detailed an account of how he conducted trials of suspected Christians who appeared before him as a result of anonymous accusations and asked for the Emperor&#x27;s guidance on how they should be treated. Pliny had never performed a legal investigation of Christians and thus consulted Trajan in order to be on solid ground regarding his actions. Pliny saved his letters and Trajan&#x27;s replies and these are the earliest surviving Roman documents to refer to early Christians.

====Epistle concerning voting systems====
Voting theorists and historians of social choice note Pliny&#x27;s early mention of how the choice of voting procedure could influence the outcome of an election. On June 24, 105, Pliny wrote a letter to Titius Aristo, where he describes a criminal trial: under the traditional rules of the Senate, there would first be a vote on guilt and then (if the accused were found guilty) on punishment, for which execution and exile were proposed. Of the three distinct proposals, acquittal, exile, and execution, acquittal had the largest number of supporters but not a majority, although exile would have defeated either acquittal or execution in a direct two-way vote. Pliny supported acquittal but anticipated that first guilt and then execution would be chosen under the traditional rules, and so he argued for a novel three-way plurality vote, which would have resulted in acquittal. In response, those in favor of execution withdrew their proposal, the vote defaulted to a traditional majority vote between exile and acquittal, and exile carried.

===Manuscripts===

The first edition of Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Epistles&quot; was published in Italy in 1471. Sometime between 1495 and 1500 Giovanni Giocondo discovered a manuscript in Paris of Pliny&#x27;s tenth book of letters, containing his correspondence with Trajan, and published it in Paris, dedicating the work to Louis XII. The first complete edition was produced by the press of Aldus Manutius in 1508. (See &quot;Editio princeps&quot; for details.)

==Villas, farms and estates==

Being wealthy, Pliny owned many villas and wrote in detail about his villa near Ostia, at Laurentum, Italy. Others included one near Lake Como named &quot;Tragedy&quot; because of its location high on a hill, and, another, &quot;Comedy,&quot; on the shores of the lake, so called because it was sited low down, referencing the practice of actors in comedy wearing flat shoes, while those in tragedy wore high-heeled buskins.

Pliny&#x27;s main estate in Italy and the one he loved best was his Villa &quot;in Tuscis&quot; near San Giustino, Umbria, under the passes of Bocca Trabaria and Bocca Serriola, where wood was harvested for Roman ships and sent to Rome via the Tiber.

As a response to &quot;declining returns from his north Italian farms&quot;, Pliny may have contemplated switching the administration of his estate to a sharecropping system called &quot;colonia partiaria&quot;. Under the sharecropping system, Pliny&#x27;s slaves would act as overseers.

<doc id="49414" wikidata="Q594595" url="?curid=49414" title="Sex-determination system">
<text>A sex-determination system is a biological system that determines the development of sexual characteristics in an organism. Most organisms that create their offspring using sexual reproduction have two common sexes, males and females, and in other species, there are hermaphrodites, organisms that can function reproductively as either female or male, or both.

There are also some species in which only one sex is present, temporarily or permanently. This can be due to parthenogenesis, the act of a female reproducing without fertilization. In some plants or algae the gametophyte stage may reproduce itself, thus producing more individuals of the same sex as the parent.

In some species, sex determination is genetic: males and females have different alleles or even different genes that specify their sexual morphology. In animals this is often accompanied by chromosomal differences, generally through combinations of XY, ZW, XO, ZO chromosomes, or haplodiploidy. The sexual differentiation is generally triggered by a main gene (a &quot;sex locus&quot;), with a multitude of other genes following in a domino effect.

In other cases, the sex of a fetus is determined by environmental variables (such as temperature). The details of some sex-determination systems are not yet fully understood.

Some species such as various plants and fish do not have a fixed sex and instead go through life cycles and change sex based on genetic cues during corresponding life stages of their type. This could be due to environmental factors such as seasons and temperature. In some gonochoric species, a few individuals may have conditions that cause a mix of different sex characteristics.

== Discovery ==

Sex determination was discovered in the mealworm by the American geneticist Nettie Stevens in 1903.

In 1694, J.R. Camerarius, conducted early experiments on pollination and reported the existence of male and female characteristics in plants(Maize).

In 1866, Gregor Mendel published on inheritance of genetic traits. This is known as Mendelian inheritance and it eventually established the modern understanding of inheritance from two gametes.

In 1902, C.E. McClung identified sex chromosomes in bugs.

In 1917, C.E. Allen, discovered sex determination mechanisms in plants.

In 1922, C.B. Bridges, put forth the Genic Balance Theory of sex determination.

==Chromosomal systems==
Among animals, the most common chromosomal sex determination systems are XY, XO, ZW, ZO, but with numerous exceptions.

According to the Tree of Sex database (as of 2023), the known sex determination systems are:
1. complex sex chromosomes, homomorphic sex chromosomes, or others

=== XX/XY sex chromosomes ===


The XX/XY sex-determination system is the most familiar, as it is found in humans. The XX/XY system is found in most other mammals, as well as some insects. In this system, females have two of the same kind of sex chromosome (XX), while males have two distinct sex chromosomes (XY). The X and Y sex chromosomes are different in shape and size from each other, unlike the rest of the chromosomes (autosomes), and are sometimes called allosomes. In some species, such as humans, organisms remain sex indifferent for a time during development (embryogenesis); in others, however, such as fruit flies, sexual differentiation occurs as soon as the egg is fertilized.

==== Y-centered sex determination ====

Some species (including humans) have a gene SRY on the Y chromosome that determines maleness. Members of SRY-reliant species can have uncommon XY chromosomal combinations such as XXY and still live.
Human sex is determined by the presence or absence of a Y chromosome with a functional SRY gene. Once the SRY gene is activated, cells create testosterone and anti-müllerian hormone which typically ensures the development of a single, male reproductive system. In typical XX embryos, cells secrete estrogen, which drives the body toward the female pathway.

In Y-centered sex determination, the SRY gene is the main gene in determining male characteristics, but multiple genes are required to develop testes. In XY mice, lack of the gene DAX1 on the X chromosome results in sterility, but in humans it causes adrenal hypoplasia congenita. However, when an extra DAX1 gene is placed on the X chromosome, the result is a female, despite the existence of SRY, since it overrides the effects of SRY. Even when there are normal sex chromosomes in XX females, duplication or expression of SOX9 causes testes to develop. Gradual sex reversal in developed mice can also occur when the gene FOXL2 is removed from females. Even though the gene DMRT1 is used by birds as their sex locus, species who have XY chromosomes also rely upon DMRT1, contained on chromosome 9, for sexual differentiation at some point in their formation.

==== X-centered sex determination ====

Some species, such as fruit flies, use the presence of two X chromosomes to determine femaleness. Species that use the number of Xs to determine sex are nonviable with an extra X chromosome.

==== Other variants of XX/XY sex determination ====

Some fish have variants of the XY sex-determination system, as well as the regular system. For example, while having an XY format, &quot;Xiphophorus nezahualcoyotl&quot; and &quot;X. milleri&quot; also have a second Y chromosome, known as Y&#x27;, that creates XY&#x27; females and YY&#x27; males.

At least one monotreme, the platypus, presents a particular sex determination scheme that in some ways resembles that of the ZW sex chromosomes of birds and lacks the SRY gene. The platypus has sex chromosomes formula_1. The males have formula_2, while females have formula_3. During meiosis, 5 of X form one chain, and 5 of Y form another chain. Thus, they behave effectively as a typical XY chromosomal system, except each of X and Y is broken into 5 parts, with the effect that recombinations occur very frequently at 4 particular points. One of the X chromosomes is homologous to the human X chromosome, and another is homologous to the bird Z chromosome.

Although it is an XY system, the platypus&#x27; sex chromosomes share no homologues with eutherian sex chromosomes. Instead, homologues with eutherian sex chromosomes lie on the platypus chromosome 6, which means that the eutherian sex chromosomes were autosomes at the time that the monotremes diverged from the therian mammals (marsupials and eutherian mammals). However, homologues to the avian DMRT1 gene on platypus sex chromosomes X3 and X5 suggest that it is possible the sex-determining gene for the platypus is the same one that is involved in bird sex-determination. More research must be conducted in order to determine the exact sex determining gene of the platypus.

=== XX/X0 sex chromosomes ===
In this variant of the XY system, females have two copies of the sex chromosome (XX) but males have only one (X0). The &quot;0&quot; denotes the absence of a second sex chromosome. Generally in this method, the sex is determined by amount of genes expressed across the two chromosomes. This system is observed in a number of insects, including the grasshoppers and crickets of order Orthoptera and in cockroaches (order Blattodea). A small number of mammals also lack a Y chromosome. These include the Amami spiny rat (&quot;Tokudaia osimensis&quot;) and the Tokunoshima spiny rat (&quot;Tokudaia tokunoshimensis&quot;) and &quot;Sorex araneus&quot;, a shrew species. Transcaucasian mole voles (&quot;Ellobius lutescens&quot;) also have a form of XO determination, in which both sexes lack a second sex chromosome. The mechanism of sex determination is not yet understood.

The nematode &quot;C. elegans&quot; is male with one sex chromosome (X0); with a pair of chromosomes (XX) it is a hermaphrodite. Its main sex gene is XOL, which encodes XOL-1 and also controls the expression of the genes TRA-2 and HER-1. These genes reduce male gene activation and increase it, respectively.

=== ZW/ZZ sex chromosomes ===
The ZW sex-determination system is found in birds, some reptiles, and some insects and other organisms. The ZW sex-determination system is reversed compared to the XY system: females have two different kinds of chromosomes (ZW), and males have two of the same kind of chromosomes (ZZ). In the chicken, this was found to be dependent on the expression of DMRT1. In birds, the genes FET1 and ASW are found on the W chromosome for females, similar to how the Y chromosome contains SRY. However, not all species depend upon the W for their sex. For example, there are moths and butterflies that are ZW, but some have been found female with ZO, as well as female with ZZW. Also, while mammals deactivate one of their extra X chromosomes when female, it appears that in the case of Lepidoptera, the males produce double the normal amount of enzymes, due to having two Z&#x27;s. Because the use of ZW sex determination is varied, it is still unknown how exactly most species determine their sex. However, reportedly, the silkworm &quot;Bombyx mori&quot; uses a single female-specific piRNA as the primary determiner of sex. Despite the similarities between the ZW and XY systems, these sex chromosomes evolved separately. In the case of the chicken, their Z chromosome is more similar to humans&#x27; autosome 9. The chicken&#x27;s Z chromosome also seems to be related to the X chromosome of the platypus. When a ZW species, such as the Komodo dragon, reproduces parthenogenetically, usually only males are produced. This is due to the fact that the haploid eggs double their chromosomes, resulting in ZZ or WW. The ZZ become males, but the WW are not viable and are not brought to term.

In both XY and ZW sex determination systems, the sex chromosome carrying the critical factors is often significantly smaller, carrying little more than the genes necessary for triggering the development of a given sex.

=== ZZ/Z0 sex chromosomes ===
The ZZ/Z0 sex-determination system is found in some moths. In these insects there is one sex chromosome, Z. Males have two Z chromosomes, whereas females have one Z. Males are ZZ, while females are Z0.

===UV sex chromosomes===
In some bryophyte and some algae species, the gametophyte stage of the life cycle, rather than being hermaphrodite, occurs as separate male or female individuals that produce male and female gametes respectively. When meiosis occurs in the sporophyte generation of the life cycle, the sex chromosomes known as U and V assort in spores that carry either the U chromosome and give rise to female gametophytes, or the V chromosome and give rise to male gametophytes.

=== Mating types ===

The mating type in microorganisms is analogous to sex in multi-cellular organisms, and is sometimes described using those terms, though they are not necessarily correlated with physical body structures. Some species have more than two mating types. &quot;Tetrahymena,&quot; a type of ciliate, has 7 mating types

Mating types are extensively studied in fungi. Among fungi, mating type is determined by chromosomal regions called mating-type loci. Furthermore, it is not as simple as &quot;two different mating types can mate&quot;, but rather, a matter of combinatorics. As a simple example, most &quot;basidiomycete&quot; have a &quot;tetrapolar heterothallism&quot; mating system: there are two loci, and mating between two individuals is possible if the alleles on &quot;both&quot; loci are different. For example, if there are 3 alleles per locus, then there would be 9 mating types, each of which can mate with 4 other mating types. By multiplicative combination, it generates a vast number of mating types. For example, &quot;Schizophyllum commune,&quot; a type of fungus, has formula_4 mating types.

=== Haplodiploidy ===
Haplodiploidy is found in insects belonging to Hymenoptera, such as ants and bees. Sex determination is controlled by the zygosity of a complementary sex determiner (&quot;csd&quot;) locus. Unfertilized eggs develop into haploid individuals which have a single, hemizygous copy of the &quot;csd&quot; locus and are therefore males. Fertilized eggs develop into diploid individuals which, due to high variability in the &quot;csd&quot; locus, are generally heterozygous females. In rare instances diploid individuals may be homozygous, these develop into sterile males.
The gene acting as a &quot;csd&quot; locus has been identified in the honeybee and several candidate genes have been proposed as a &quot;csd&quot; locus for other Hymenopterans.
Most females in the Hymenoptera order can decide the sex of their offspring by holding received sperm in their spermatheca and either releasing it into their oviduct or not. This allows them to create more workers, depending on the status of the colony.

=== Polygenic sex determination ===
Polygenic sex determination is when the sex is primarily determined by genes that occur on multiple non-homologous chromosomes. The environment may have a limited, minor influence on sex determination. Examples include African cichlid fish (&quot;Metriaclima spp.&quot;), lemmings (&quot;Myopus schisticolor&quot;), green swordtail, medaka, etc. In such systems, there is typically a dominance hierarchy, where one system is dominant over another if in conflict. For example, in some species of cichlid fish from Lake Malawi, if an individual has both the XY locus (on one chromosome pair) and the WZ locus (on another chromosome pair), then the W is dominant and the individual has a female phenotype.

The sex-determination system of zebrafish is polygenic. Juvenile zebrafishes (0–30 days after hatching) have both ovary-like tissue to testis tissue. They then develop into male or female adults, with the determination based on a complex interaction genes on multiple chromosomes, but not affected by environmental variations.

===Other chromosomal systems===
In systems with two sex chromosomes, they can be heteromorphic or homomorphic. Homomorphic sex chromosomes are almost identical in size and gene content. The two familiar kinds of sex chromosome pairs (XY and ZW) are heteromorphic. Homomorphic sex chromosomes exist among pufferfish, ratite birds, pythons, and European tree frogs. Some are quite old, meaning that there is some evolutionary force that resists their differentiation. For example, three species of European tree frogs have homologous, homomorphic sex chromosomes, and this homomorphism was maintained for at least 5.4 million years by occasional recombination.

The &quot;Nematocera&quot;, particularly the &quot;Simuliids&quot; and &quot;Chironomus&quot;, have sex determination regions that are labile, meaning that one species may have the sex determination region in one chromosome, but a closely related species might have the same region moved to a different non-homologous chromosome. Some species even have the sex determination region different among individuals &quot;within&quot; &quot;the same species&quot; (intraspecific variation). In some species, some populations have homomorphic sex chromosomes while other populations have heteromorphic sex chromosomes.

The New Zealand frog, &quot;Leiopelma hochstetteri&quot;, uses a supernumerary sex chromosome. With zero of that chromosome, the frog develops into a male. With one or more, the frog develops into a female. One female had as many as 16 of that chromosome.

Different populations of the Japanese frog &quot;Rana rugosa&quot; uses different systems. Two use homomorphic male heterogamety, one uses XX/XY, one uses ZZ/ZW. Remarkably, the X and Z chromosomes are homologous, and the Y and W as well. &quot;Dmrt1&quot; is on autosome 1 and not sex-linked. This means that an XX female individual is genetically similar to a ZZ male individual, and an XY male individual is to a ZW female individual. The mechanism behind this is yet unclear, but it is hypothesized that during its recent evolution, the XY-to-ZW transition occurred twice.

&quot;Clarias gariepinus&quot; uses both XX/XY and ZW/ZZ system within the species, with some populations using homomorphic XX/XY while others using heteromorphic ZW/ZZ. A population in Thailand appears to use both systems simultaneously, possibly because &quot;C. gariepinus&quot; were not native to Thailand, and were introduced from different source populations which resulted in a mixture.

Multiple sex chromosomes like those of platypus also occurs in bony fish. Some moths and butterflies have formula_5 or formula_6.

The Southern platyfish has a complex sex determination system involving 3 sex chromosomes and 4 autosomal alleles.

&quot;Gastrotheca pseustes&quot; has formula_7 C-banding heteromorphism, meaning that both males and females have XY chromosomes, but their Y chromosomes are different on one or more C-bands. &quot;Eleutherodactylus maussi&quot; has a formula_8 system.

== Evolution ==
See for a review.

=== Origin of sex chromosomes ===
Sexual chromosome pairs can arise from an autosomal pair that, for various reasons, stopped recombination, allowing for their divergence. The rate at which recombination is suppressed, and therefore the rate of sex chromosome divergence, is very different across clades.

In analogy with geological strata, historical events in the evolution of sex chromosomes are called evolutionary strata. The human Y-chromosome has had about 5 strata since the origin of the X and Y chromosomes about 300 Mya from a pair of autosomes. Each stratum was formed when a pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of the Y chromosome is inverted, stopping it from recombination with the X chromosome. Over time, each inverted region decays, possibly due to Muller&#x27;s ratchet. Primate Y-chromosome evolution was rapid, with multiple inversions and shifts of the boundary of PAR.

Among many species of the salamanders, the two chromosomes are only distinguished by a pericentric inversion, so that the banding pattern of the X chromosome is the same as that of Y, but with a region near the centromere reversed. (fig 7 ) In some species, the X is pericentrically inverted and the Y is ancestral. In other species it is the opposite. (p. 15 )

The gene content of the X chromosome is almost identical among placental mammals. This is hypothesized to be because the X inactivation means any change would cause serious disruption, thus subjecting it to strong purifying selection. Similarly, birds have highly conserved Z chromosomes.

=== Neo-sex chromosomes ===
Neo-sex chromosomes are currently existing sex chromosomes that formed when an autosome pair fused to the previously existing sex chromosome pair. Following this fusion, the autosomal portion undergoes recombination suppression, allowing them to differentiate. Such systems have been observed in insects, reptiles, birds, and mammals. They are useful to the study of the evolution of Y chromosome degeneration and dosage compensation.

=== Sex-chromosome turnover ===
The sex-chromosome turnover is an evolutionary phenomenon where sex chromosomes disappear, or becomes autosomal, and autosomal chromosomes become sexual, repeatedly over evolutionary time. Some lineages have extensive turnover, but others don&#x27;t. Generally, in an XY system, if the Y chromosome is degenerate, mostly different from the X chromosome, and has X dosage compensation, then turnover is unlikely. In particular, this applies to humans.

The ZW and XY systems can evolve into to each other due to sexual conflict.

=== Homomorphism and the fountain of youth ===
It is an evolutionary puzzle why certain sex chromosomes remain homomorphic over millions of years, especially among lineages of fishes, amphibians, and nonavian reptiles. The fountain-of-youth model states that heteromorphy results from recombination suppression, and recombination suppression results from the male phenotype, not the sex chromosomes themselves. Therefore, if some XY sex-reversed females are fertile and adaptive under some circumstances, then the X and Y chromosomes would recombine in these individuals, preventing Y chromosome decay and maintaining long-term homomorphism.

Sex reversal denotes a situation where the phenotypic sex is different from the genotypic sex. While in humans, sex reversal (such as the XX male syndrome) are often infertile, sex-reversed individuals of some species are fertile under some conditions. For example, some XY-individuals in population of Chinook salmon in the Columbia River became fertile females, producing YY sons. Since Chinook salmons have homomorphic sex chromosomes, such YY sons are healthy. When YY males mate with XX females, all their progeny would be XY male if grown under normal conditions.

Support for the hypothesis is found in the common frog, for which XX males and XY males both suppresses sex chromosome recombination, but XX and XY females both recombine at the same rate.

==Environmental systems==
===Temperature-dependent===

Many other sex-determination systems exist. In some species of reptiles, including alligators, some turtles, and the tuatara, sex is determined by the temperature at which the egg is incubated during a temperature-sensitive period. There are no examples of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in birds. Megapodes had formerly been thought to exhibit this phenomenon, but were found to actually have different temperature-dependent embryo mortality rates for each sex. For some species with TSD, sex determination is achieved by exposure to hotter temperatures resulting in the offspring being one sex and cooler temperatures resulting in the other. This type of TSD is called &quot;Pattern I&quot;. For others species using TSD, it is exposure to temperatures on both extremes that results in offspring of one sex, and exposure to moderate temperatures that results in offspring of the opposite sex, called &quot;Pattern II&quot; TSD. The specific temperatures required to produce each sex are known as the female-promoting temperature and the male-promoting temperature. When the temperature stays near the threshold during the temperature sensitive period, the sex ratio is varied between the two sexes. Some species&#x27; temperature standards are based on when a particular enzyme is created. These species that rely upon temperature for their sex determination do not have the SRY gene, but have other genes such as DAX1, DMRT1, and SOX9 that are expressed or not expressed depending on the temperature. The sex of some species, such as the Nile tilapia, Australian skink lizard, and Australian dragon lizard, has an initial bias, set by chromosomes, but can later be changed by the temperature of incubation.

It is unknown how exactly temperature-dependent sex determination evolved. It could have evolved through certain sexes being more suited to certain areas that fit the temperature requirements. For example, a warmer area could be more suitable for nesting, so more females are produced to increase the amount that nest next season. 
In amniotes, environmental sex determination preceded the genetically determined systems of birds and mammals; it is thought that a temperature-dependent amniote was the common ancestor of amniotes with sex chromosomes.

===Other environmental systems===
There are other environmental sex determination systems including location-dependent determination systems as seen in the marine worm &quot;Bonellia viridis&quot; – larvae become males if they make physical contact with a female, and females if they end up on the bare sea floor. This is triggered by the presence of a chemical produced by the females, bonellin. Some species, such as some snails, practice sex change: adults start out male, then become female. In tropical clownfish, the dominant individual in a group becomes female while the other ones are male, and bluehead wrasses (&quot;Thalassoma bifasciatum&quot;) are the reverse. 

Clownfish live in colonies of several small undifferentiated fish and two large fish (male and female). The male and female are the only sexually mature fish to reproduce. Clownfish are protandrous hermaphrodites, which means after they mature into males, they eventually can transform into females. They develop undifferentiated until they are needed to fill a certain role in their environment, i.e., if they receive the social and environmental cues to do so. 

Some species, however, have no sex-determination system. Hermaphrodite species include the common earthworm and certain species of snails. A few species of fish, reptiles, and insects reproduce by parthenogenesis and are female altogether. There are some reptiles, such as the boa constrictor and Komodo dragon that can reproduce both sexually and asexually, depending on whether a mate is available.

== Others ==
There are exceptional sex-determination systems, neither genetic nor environmental.

The &quot;Wolbachia&quot; genus of parasitic bacteria lives inside the cytoplasm of its host, and is vertically transmitted from parents to children. They primarily infect arthropods and nematodes. Different &quot;Wolbachia&quot; can determine the sex of its host by a variety of means.

In some species, there is &quot;paternal genome elimination&quot;, where sons lose the entire genome from the father.

&quot;Mitochondrial male sterility&quot;: In many flowering plants, the mitochondria can cause hermaphrodite individuals to be unable to father offsprings, effectively turning them into exclusive females. This is a form of mother’s curse. It is an evolutionarily adaptive strategy for mitochondria as mitochondrial inheritance is exclusively from mother to child. The first published case of mitochondrial male sterility among metazoan was reported in 2022 in the hermaphroditic snail &quot;Physa acuta&quot;.

In some flies and crustaceans, all offspring of a particular individual female are either exclusively male or exclusively female (&quot;monogeny&quot;).

== Evolution ==

Sex determination systems may have evolved from mating type, which is a feature of microorganisms.

Chromosomal sex determination may have evolved early in the history of eukaryotes. But in plants it has been suggested to have evolved recently.

The accepted hypothesis of XY and ZW sex chromosome evolution in amniotes is that they evolved at the same time, in two different branches.

No genes are shared between the avian ZW and mammal XY chromosomes and the chicken Z chromosome is similar to the human autosomal chromosome 9, rather than X or Y. This suggests not that the ZW and XY sex-determination systems share an origin but that the sex chromosomes are derived from autosomal chromosomes of the common ancestor of birds and mammals. In the platypus, a monotreme, the X1 chromosome shares homology with therian mammals, while the X5 chromosome contains an avian sex-determination gene, further suggesting an evolutionary link.

However, there is some evidence to suggest that there could have been transitions between ZW and XY, such as in &quot;Xiphophorus maculatus&quot;, which have both ZW and XY systems in the same population, despite the fact that ZW and XY have different gene locations. A recent theoretical model raises the possibility of both transitions between the XY/XX and ZZ/ZW system and environmental sex determination The platypus&#x27; genes also back up the possible evolutionary link between XY and ZW, because they have the DMRT1 gene possessed by birds on their X chromosomes. Regardless, XY and ZW follow a similar route. All sex chromosomes started out as an original autosome of an original amniote that relied upon temperature to determine the sex of offspring. After the mammals separated, the reptile branch further split into Lepidosauria and Archosauromorpha. These two groups both evolved the ZW system separately, as evidenced by the existence of different sex chromosomal locations. In mammals, one of the autosome pair, now Y, mutated its SOX3 gene into the SRY gene, causing that chromosome to designate sex. After this mutation, the SRY-containing chromosome inverted and was no longer completely homologous with its partner. The regions of the X and Y chromosomes that are still homologous to one another are known as the pseudoautosomal region. Once it inverted, the Y chromosome became unable to remedy deleterious mutations, and thus degenerated. There is some concern that the Y chromosome will shrink further and stop functioning in ten million years: but the Y chromosome has been strictly conserved after its initial rapid gene loss.

There are some vertebrate species, such as the medaka fish, that evolved sex chromosomes separately; their Y chromosome never inverted and can still swap genes with the X. These species&#x27; sex chromosomes are relatively primitive and unspecialized. Because the Y does not have male-specific genes and can interact with the X, XY and YY females can be formed as well as XX males. Non-inverted Y chromosomes with long histories are found in pythons and emus, each system being more than 120 million years old, suggesting that inversions are not necessarily an eventuality. XO sex determination can evolve from XY sex determination with about 2 million years.

<text>NMOS or nMOS logic (from N-type metal–oxide–semiconductor) uses n-type (-) MOSFETs (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors) to implement logic gates and other digital circuits. 

NMOS transistors operate by creating an inversion layer in a p-type transistor body. This inversion layer, called the n-channel, can conduct electrons between n-type &quot;source&quot; and &quot;drain&quot; terminals. The n-channel is created by applying voltage to the third terminal, called the &quot;gate&quot;. Like other MOSFETs, nMOS transistors have four modes of operation: cut-off (or subthreshold), triode, saturation (sometimes called active), and velocity saturation.

NMOS AND-by-default logic can produce unusual glitches or buggy behavior in NMOS components, such as the 6502 &quot;illegal opcodes&quot; which are absent in CMOS 6502s. In some cases such as Commodore&#x27;s VIC-II chip, the bugs present in the chip&#x27;s logic were extensively exploited by programmers for graphics effects.

For many years, NMOS circuits were much faster than comparable PMOS and CMOS circuits, which had to use much slower p-channel transistors. It was also easier to manufacture NMOS than CMOS, as the latter has to implement p-channel transistors in special n-wells on the p-substrate, not prone to damage from bus conflicts, and not as vulnerable to electrostatic discharge damage. The major drawback with NMOS (and most other logic families) is that a direct current must flow through a logic gate even when the output is in a steady state (low in the case of NMOS). This means static power dissipation, i.e. power drain even when the circuit is not switching, leading to high power consumption.

Another disadvantage of NMOS circuits is their thermal output. Due to the need to keep constant voltage running through the circuit to hold the transistors&#x27; states, NMOS circuits can generate a considerable amount of heat in operation which can reduce the device&#x27;s reliability. This was especially problematic with the early large gate process nodes in the 1970s. CMOS circuits for contrast generate almost no heat unless the transistor count approaches 1 million.

CMOS components were relatively uncommon in the 1970s-early 1980s and would typically be indicated with a &quot;C&quot; in the part number. Throughout the 1980s, both NMOS and CMOS parts were widely used with CMOS becoming more widespread as the decade went along. NMOS was preferred for components that performed active processing such as CPUs or graphics processors due to its higher speed and cheaper manufacturing cost as these were expensive compared to a passive component such as a memory chip, and some chips such as the Motorola 68030 were hybrids with both NMOS and CMOS sections. CMOS has been near-universal in integrated circuits since the 1990s.

Additionally, just like in diode–transistor logic, transistor–transistor logic, emitter-coupled logic etc., the asymmetric input logic levels make NMOS and PMOS circuits more susceptible to noise than CMOS. These disadvantages are why CMOS logic has supplanted most of these types in most high-speed digital circuits such as microprocessors despite the fact that CMOS was originally very slow compared to logic gates built with bipolar transistors.

==Overview==
MOS stands for &quot;metal-oxide-semiconductor&quot;, reflecting the way MOS-transistors were originally constructed, predominantly before the 1970s, with gates of metal, typically aluminium. Since around 1970, however, most MOS circuits have used self-aligned gates made of polycrystalline silicon, a technology first developed by Federico Faggin at Fairchild Semiconductor. These silicon gates are still used in most types of MOSFET based integrated circuits, although metal gates (Al or Cu) started to reappear in the early 2000s for certain types of high speed circuits, such as high performance microprocessors.

The MOSFETs are n-type enhancement mode transistors, arranged in a so-called &quot;pull-down network&quot; (PDN) between the logic gate output and negative supply voltage (typically the ground). A pull up (i.e. a &quot;load&quot; that can be thought of as a resistor, see below) is placed between the positive supply voltage and each logic gate output. Any logic gate, including the logical inverter, can then be implemented by designing a network of parallel and/or series circuits, such that if the desired output for a certain combination of boolean input values is zero (or false), the PDN will be active, meaning that at least one transistor is allowing a current path between the negative supply and the output. This causes a voltage drop over the load, and thus a low voltage at the output, representing the &quot;zero.&quot;
As an example, here is a NOR gate implemented in schematic NMOS. If either input A or input B is high (logic 1, = True), the respective MOS transistor acts as a very low resistance between the output and the negative supply, forcing the output to be low (logic 0, = False). When both A and B are high, both transistors are conductive, creating an even lower resistance path to ground. The only case where the output is high is when both transistors are off, which occurs only when both A and B are low, thus satisfying the truth table of a NOR gate:

A MOSFET can be made to operate as a resistor, so the whole circuit can be made with n-channel MOSFETs only. NMOS circuits are slow to transition from low to high. When transitioning from high to low, the transistors provide low resistance, and the capacitive charge at the output drains away very quickly (similar to discharging a capacitor through a very low resistor). But the resistance between the output and the positive supply rail is much greater, so the low to high transition takes longer (similar to charging a capacitor through a high value resistor). Using a resistor of lower value will speed up the process but also increases static power dissipation. However, a better (and the most common) way to make the gates faster is to use depletion-mode transistors instead of enhancement-mode transistors as loads. This is called depletion-load NMOS logic.

<text>Extinction is the termination of a taxon by the death of its last member. A taxon may become functionally extinct before the death of its last member if it loses the capacity to reproduce and recover. Because a species&#x27; potential range may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as Lazarus taxa, where a species presumed extinct abruptly &quot;reappears&quot; (typically in the fossil record) after a period of apparent absence.

More than 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth, amounting to over five billion species, are estimated to have died out. It is estimated that there are currently around 8.7 million species of eukaryotes globally, and possibly many times more if microorganisms, such as bacteria, are included. Notable extinct animal species include non-avian dinosaurs, palaeotheres, saber-toothed cats, dodos, mammoths, ground sloths, thylacines, trilobites, golden toads, and passenger pigeons.

Through evolution, species arise through the process of speciation—where new varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an ecological niche—and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition. The relationship between animals and their ecological niches has been firmly established. A typical species becomes extinct within 10 million years of its first appearance, although some species, called living fossils, survive with little to no morphological change for hundreds of millions of years.

Mass extinctions are relatively rare events; however, isolated extinctions of species and clades are quite common, and are a natural part of the evolutionary process. Only recently have extinctions been recorded and scientists have become alarmed at the current high rate of extinctions. Most species that become extinct are never scientifically documented. Some scientists estimate that up to half of presently existing plant and animal species may become extinct by 2100. A 2018 report indicated that the phylogenetic diversity of 300 mammalian species erased during the human era since the Late Pleistocene would require 5 to 7 million years to recover.

According to the 2019 &quot;Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services&quot; by IPBES, the biomass of wild mammals has fallen by 82%, natural ecosystems have lost about half their area and a million species are at risk of extinction—all largely as a result of human actions. Twenty-five percent of plant and animal species are threatened with extinction. In a subsequent report, IPBES listed unsustainable fishing, hunting and logging as being some of the primary drivers of the global extinction crisis. 

In June 2019, one million species of plants and animals were at risk of extinction. At least 571 plant species have been lost since 1750, but likely many more. The main cause of the extinctions is the destruction of natural habitats by human activities, such as cutting down forests and converting land into fields for farming.

A dagger symbol (†) placed next to the name of a species or other taxon normally indicates its status as extinct.

== Examples ==
Examples of species and subspecies that are extinct include:

* Steller&#x27;s sea cow (the last known member died circa 1768)
* Dodo (the last confirmed sighting was in 1662)
* Chinese paddlefish (last seen in 2003; declared extinct in 2022)
* Great auk (last confirmed pair was killed in the 1840s)
* Thylacine (the last thylacine killed in the wild was shot in 1930; the last captive tiger lived in Hobart Zoo until 1936)
* Kauai O&#x27;o (last known member was heard in 1987; the entire Mohoidae family became extinct with it)
* Spectacled cormorant (last known members were said to live in the 1850s)
* Carolina parakeet (last known member named Incas died in captivity in 1918; declared extinct in 1939)
* Passenger pigeon (last known member named Martha died in captivity in 1914)
* Tasmanian emu (the last claimed sighting of the emu was in 1839)
* Japanese Sea Lion (the last confirmed record was a juvenile specimen captured in 1974)
* Schomburgk&#x27;s deer (became extinct in the wild in 1932; the last captive deer was killed in 1938)
* Quagga (hunted to extinction in the late 19th century; the last captive quagga died in Natura Artis Magistra in 1883)

==Definition==
A species is extinct when the last existing member dies. Extinction therefore becomes a certainty when there are no surviving individuals that can reproduce and create a new generation. A species may become functionally extinct when only a handful of individuals survive, which cannot reproduce due to poor health, age, sparse distribution over a large range, a lack of individuals of both sexes (in sexually reproducing species), or other reasons.

Pinpointing the extinction (or pseudoextinction) of a species requires a clear definition of that species. If it is to be declared extinct, the species in question must be uniquely distinguishable from any ancestor or daughter species, and from any other closely related species. Extinction of a species (or replacement by a daughter species) plays a key role in the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis of Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge.
In ecology, &quot;extinction&quot; is sometimes used informally to refer to local extinction, in which a species ceases to exist in the chosen area of study, despite still existing elsewhere. Local extinctions may be made good by the reintroduction of individuals of that species taken from other locations; wolf reintroduction is an example of this. Species that are not globally extinct are termed extant. Those species that are extant, yet are threatened with extinction, are referred to as threatened or endangered species.
Currently, an important aspect of extinction is human attempts to preserve critically endangered species. These are reflected by the creation of the conservation status &quot;extinct in the wild&quot; (EW). Species listed under this status by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) are not known to have any living specimens in the wild and are maintained only in zoos or other artificial environments. Some of these species are functionally extinct, as they are no longer part of their natural habitat and it is unlikely the species will ever be restored to the wild. When possible, modern zoological institutions try to maintain a viable population for species preservation and possible future reintroduction to the wild, through use of carefully planned breeding programs.

The extinction of one species&#x27; wild population can have knock-on effects, causing further extinctions. These are also called &quot;chains of extinction&quot;. This is especially common with extinction of keystone species.

A 2018 study indicated that the sixth mass extinction started in the Late Pleistocene could take up to 5 to 7 million years to restore mammal diversity to what it was before the human era.

===Pseudoextinction===
Extinction of a parent species where daughter species or subspecies are still extant is called pseudoextinction or phyletic extinction. Effectively, the old taxon vanishes, transformed (anagenesis) into a successor, or split into more than one (cladogenesis).

Pseudoextinction is difficult to demonstrate unless one has a strong chain of evidence linking a living species to members of a pre-existing species. For example, it is sometimes claimed that the extinct &quot;Hyracotherium&quot;, which was an early horse that shares a common ancestor with the modern horse, is pseudoextinct, rather than extinct, because there are several extant species of &quot;Equus&quot;, including zebra and donkey; however, as fossil species typically leave no genetic material behind, one cannot say whether &quot;Hyracotherium&quot; evolved into more modern horse species or merely evolved from a common ancestor with modern horses. Pseudoextinction is much easier to demonstrate for larger taxonomic groups.

===Lazarus taxa===

A Lazarus taxon or Lazarus species refers to instances where a species or taxon was thought to be extinct, but was later rediscovered. It can also refer to instances where large gaps in the fossil record of a taxon result in fossils reappearing much later, although the taxon may have ultimately become extinct at a later point.

The coelacanth, a fish related to lungfish and tetrapods, is an example of a Lazarus taxon that was known only from the fossil record and was considered to have been extinct since the end of the Cretaceous Period. In 1938, however, a living specimen was found off the Chalumna River (now Tyolomnqa) on the east coast of South Africa. &quot;Calliostoma bullatum&quot;, a species of deepwater sea snail originally described from fossils in 1844 proved to be a Lazarus species when extant individuals were described in 2019.

Attenborough&#x27;s long-beaked echidna (&quot;Zaglossus attenboroughi&quot;) is an example of a Lazarus species from Papua New Guinea that had last been sighted in 1962 and believed to be possibly extinct, until it was recorded again in November 2023.

Some species currently thought to be extinct have had continued speculation that they may still exist, and in the event of rediscovery would be considered Lazarus species. Examples include the thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger (&quot;Thylacinus cynocephalus&quot;), the last known example of which died in Hobart Zoo in Tasmania in 1936; the Japanese wolf (&quot;Canis lupus hodophilax&quot;), last sighted over 100 years ago; the American ivory-billed woodpecker (&quot;Campephilus principalis&quot;), with the last universally accepted sighting in 1944; and the slender-billed curlew (&quot;Numenius tenuirostris&quot;), not seen since 2007.

==Causes==
As long as species have been evolving, species have been going extinct. It is estimated that over 99.9% of all species that ever lived are extinct. The average lifespan of a species is 1–10 million years, although this varies widely between taxa.
A variety of causes can contribute directly or indirectly to the extinction of a species or group of species. &quot;Just as each species is unique&quot;, write Beverly and Stephen C. Stearns, &quot;so is each extinction ... the causes for each are varied—some subtle and complex, others obvious and simple&quot;. Most simply, any species that cannot survive and reproduce in its environment and cannot move to a new environment where it can do so, dies out and becomes extinct. Extinction of a species may come suddenly when an otherwise healthy species is wiped out completely, as when toxic pollution renders its entire habitat unliveable; or may occur gradually over thousands or millions of years, such as when a species gradually loses out in competition for food to better adapted competitors. Extinction may occur a long time after the events that set it in motion, a phenomenon known as extinction debt.

Assessing the relative importance of genetic factors compared to environmental ones as the causes of extinction has been compared to the debate on nature and nurture. The question of whether more extinctions in the fossil record have been caused by evolution or by competition or by predation or by disease or by catastrophe is a subject of discussion; Mark Newman, the author of &quot;Modeling Extinction&quot;, argues for a mathematical model that falls in all positions. By contrast, conservation biology uses the extinction vortex model to classify extinctions by cause. When concerns about human extinction have been raised, for example in Sir Martin Rees&#x27; 2003 book &quot;Our Final Hour&quot;, those concerns lie with the effects of climate change or technological disaster.

Human-driven extinction started as humans migrated out of Africa more than 60,000 years ago. Currently, environmental groups and some governments are concerned with the extinction of species caused by humanity, and they try to prevent further extinctions through a variety of conservation programs. Humans can cause extinction of a species through overharvesting, pollution, habitat destruction, introduction of invasive species (such as new predators and food competitors), overhunting, and other influences. Explosive, unsustainable human population growth and increasing per capita consumption are essential drivers of the extinction crisis. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), 784 extinctions have been recorded since the year 1500, the arbitrary date selected to define &quot;recent&quot; extinctions, up to the year 2004; with many more likely to have gone unnoticed. Several species have also been listed as extinct since 2004.

=== Genetics and demographic phenomena ===

If adaptation increasing population fitness is slower than environmental degradation plus the accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations, then a population will go extinct. Smaller populations have fewer beneficial mutations entering the population each generation, slowing adaptation. It is also easier for slightly deleterious mutations to fix in small populations; the resulting positive feedback loop between small population size and low fitness can cause mutational meltdown.

Limited geographic range is the most important determinant of genus extinction at background rates but becomes increasingly irrelevant as mass extinction arises. Limited geographic range is a cause both of small population size and of greater vulnerability to local environmental catastrophes.

Extinction rates can be affected not just by population size, but by any factor that affects evolvability, including balancing selection, cryptic genetic variation, phenotypic plasticity, and robustness. A diverse or deep gene pool gives a population a higher chance in the short term of surviving an adverse change in conditions. Effects that cause or reward a loss in genetic diversity can increase the chances of extinction of a species. Population bottlenecks can dramatically reduce genetic diversity by severely limiting the number of reproducing individuals and make inbreeding more frequent.

=== Genetic pollution ===

Extinction sometimes results for species evolved to specific ecologies that are subjected to genetic pollution—i.e., uncontrolled hybridization, introgression and genetic swamping that lead to homogenization or out-competition from the introduced (or hybrid) species. Endemic populations can face such extinctions when new populations are imported or selectively bred by people, or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact. Extinction is likeliest for rare species coming into contact with more abundant ones; interbreeding can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids, depleting the purebred gene pool (for example, the endangered wild water buffalo is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from the abundant domestic water buffalo). Such extinctions are not always apparent from morphological (non-genetic) observations. Some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionary process; nevertheless, hybridization (with or without introgression) threatens rare species&#x27; existence.

The gene pool of a species or a population is the variety of genetic information in its living members. A large gene pool (extensive genetic diversity) is associated with robust populations that can survive bouts of intense selection. Meanwhile, low genetic diversity (see inbreeding and population bottlenecks) reduces the range of adaptions possible. Replacing native with alien genes narrows genetic diversity within the original population, thereby increasing the chance of extinction.

=== Habitat degradation ===
Habitat degradation is currently the main anthropogenic cause of species extinctions. The main cause of habitat degradation worldwide is agriculture, with urban sprawl, logging, mining, and some fishing practices close behind. The degradation of a species&#x27; habitat may alter the fitness landscape to such an extent that the species is no longer able to survive and becomes extinct. This may occur by direct effects, such as the environment becoming toxic, or indirectly, by limiting a species&#x27; ability to compete effectively for diminished resources or against new competitor species.

Habitat destruction, particularly the removal of vegetation that stabilizes soil, enhances erosion and diminishes nutrient availability in terrestrial ecosystems. This degradation can lead to a reduction in agricultural productivity. Furthermore, increased erosion contributes to poorer water quality by elevating the levels of sediment and pollutants in rivers and streams.

Habitat degradation through toxicity can kill off a species very rapidly, by killing all living members through contamination or sterilizing them. It can also occur over longer periods at lower toxicity levels by affecting life span, reproductive capacity, or competitiveness.

Habitat degradation can also take the form of a physical destruction of niche habitats. The widespread destruction of tropical rainforests and replacement with open pastureland is widely cited as an example of this; elimination of the dense forest eliminated the infrastructure needed by many species to survive. For example, a fern that depends on dense shade for protection from direct sunlight can no longer survive without forest to shelter it. Another example is the destruction of ocean floors by bottom trawling.

Diminished resources or introduction of new competitor species also often accompany habitat degradation. Global warming has allowed some species to expand their range, bringing competition to other species that previously occupied that area. Sometimes these new competitors are predators and directly affect prey species, while at other times they may merely outcompete vulnerable species for limited resources. Vital resources including water and food can also be limited during habitat degradation, leading to extinction.

=== Predation, competition, and disease ===
In the natural course of events, species become extinct for a number of reasons, including but not limited to: extinction of a necessary host, prey or pollinator, interspecific competition, inability to deal with evolving diseases and changing environmental conditions (particularly sudden changes) which can act to introduce novel predators, or to remove prey. Recently in geological time, humans have become an additional cause of extinction of some species, either as a new mega-predator or by transporting animals and plants from one part of the world to another. Such introductions have been occurring for thousands of years, sometimes intentionally (e.g. livestock released by sailors on islands as a future source of food) and sometimes accidentally (e.g. rats escaping from boats). In most cases, the introductions are unsuccessful, but when an invasive alien species does become established, the consequences can be catastrophic. Invasive alien species can affect native species directly by eating them, competing with them, and introducing pathogens or parasites that sicken or kill them; or indirectly by destroying or degrading their habitat. Human populations may themselves act as invasive predators. According to the &quot;overkill hypothesis&quot;, the swift extinction of the megafauna in areas such as Australia (40,000 years before present), North and South America (12,000 years before present), Madagascar, Hawaii (AD 300–1000), and New Zealand (AD 1300–1500), resulted from the sudden introduction of human beings to environments full of animals that had never seen them before and were therefore completely unadapted to their predation techniques.

=== Coextinction ===

Coextinction refers to the loss of a species due to the extinction of another; for example, the extinction of parasitic insects following the loss of their hosts. Coextinction can also occur when a species loses its pollinator, or to predators in a food chain who lose their prey. &quot;Species coextinction is a manifestation of one of the interconnectednesses of organisms in complex ecosystems ... While coextinction may not be the most important cause of species extinctions, it is certainly an insidious one.&quot; Coextinction is especially common when a keystone species goes extinct. Models suggest that coextinction is the most common form of biodiversity loss. There may be a cascade of coextinction across the trophic levels. Such effects are most severe in mutualistic and parasitic relationships. An example of coextinction is the Haast&#x27;s eagle and the moa: the Haast&#x27;s eagle was a predator that became extinct because its food source became extinct. The moa were several species of flightless birds that were a food source for the Haast&#x27;s eagle.

=== Climate change ===

Extinction as a result of climate change has been confirmed by fossil studies. Particularly, the extinction of amphibians during the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse, 305 million years ago. A 2003 review across 14 biodiversity research centers predicted that, because of climate change, 15–37% of land species would be &quot;committed to extinction&quot; by 2050. The ecologically rich areas that would potentially suffer the heaviest losses include the Cape Floristic Region and the Caribbean Basin. These areas might see a doubling of present carbon dioxide levels and rising temperatures that could eliminate 56,000 plant and 3,700 animal species. Climate change has also been found to be a factor in habitat loss and desertification.

=== Sexual selection and male investment ===
Studies of fossils following species from the time they evolved to their extinction show that species with high sexual dimorphism, especially characteristics in males that are used to compete for mating, are at a higher risk of extinction and die out faster than less sexually dimorphic species, the least sexually dimorphic species surviving for millions of years while the most sexually dimorphic species die out within mere thousands of years. Earlier studies based on counting the number of currently living species in modern taxa have shown a higher number of species in more sexually dimorphic taxa which have been interpreted as higher survival in taxa with more sexual selection, but such studies of modern species only measure indirect effects of extinction and are subject to error sources such as dying and doomed taxa speciating more due to splitting of habitat ranges into more small isolated groups during the habitat retreat of taxa approaching extinction. Possible causes of the higher extinction risk in species with more sexual selection shown by the comprehensive fossil studies that rule out such error sources include expensive sexually selected ornaments having negative effects on the ability to survive natural selection, as well as sexual selection removing a diversity of genes that under current ecological conditions are neutral for natural selection but some of which may be important for surviving climate change.

== Mass extinctions ==
There have been at least five mass extinctions in the history of life on earth, and four in the last 350 million years in which many species have disappeared in a relatively short period of geological time. A massive eruptive event that released large quantities of tephra particles into the atmosphere is considered to be one likely cause of the &quot;Permian–Triassic extinction event&quot; about 250 million years ago, which is estimated to have killed 90% of species then existing. There is also evidence to suggest that this event was preceded by another mass extinction, known as Olson&#x27;s Extinction. The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event (K–Pg) occurred 66 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period; it is best known for having wiped out non-avian dinosaurs, among many other species.

=== Modern extinctions ===


According to a 1998 survey of 400 biologists conducted by New York&#x27;s American Museum of Natural History, nearly 70% believed that the Earth is currently in the early stages of a human-caused mass extinction, known as the Holocene extinction. In that survey, the same proportion of respondents agreed with the prediction that up to 20% of all living populations could become extinct within 30 years (by 2028). A 2014 special edition of &quot;Science&quot; declared there is widespread consensus on the issue of human-driven mass species extinctions. A 2020 study published in &quot;PNAS&quot; stated that the contemporary extinction crisis &quot;may be the most serious environmental threat to the persistence of civilization, because it is irreversible.&quot;

Biologist E. O. Wilson estimated in 2002 that if current rates of human destruction of the biosphere continue, one-half of all plant and animal species of life on earth will be extinct in 100 years. More significantly, the current rate of global species extinctions is estimated as 100 to 1,000 times &quot;background&quot; rates (the average extinction rates in the evolutionary time scale of planet Earth), faster than at any other time in human history, while future rates are likely 10,000 times higher. However, some groups are going extinct much faster. Biologists Paul R. Ehrlich and Stuart Pimm, among others, contend that human population growth and overconsumption are the main drivers of the modern extinction crisis.

In January 2020, the UN&#x27;s Convention on Biological Diversity drafted a plan to mitigate the contemporary extinction crisis by establishing a deadline of 2030 to protect 30% of the Earth&#x27;s land and oceans and reduce pollution by 50%, with the goal of allowing for the restoration of ecosystems by 2050. The 2020 United Nations&#x27; &quot;Global Biodiversity Outlook&quot; report stated that of the 20 biodiversity goals laid out by the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in 2010, only 6 were &quot;partially achieved&quot; by the deadline of 2020. The report warned that biodiversity will continue to decline if the status quo is not changed, in particular the &quot;currently unsustainable patterns of production and consumption, population growth and technological developments&quot;. In a 2021 report published in the journal &quot;Frontiers in Conservation Science&quot;, some top scientists asserted that even if the Aichi Biodiversity Targets set for 2020 had been achieved, it would not have resulted in a significant mitigation of biodiversity loss. They added that failure of the global community to reach these targets is hardly surprising given that biodiversity loss is &quot;nowhere close to the top of any country&#x27;s priorities, trailing far behind other concerns such as employment, healthcare, economic growth, or currency stability.&quot;

== History of scientific understanding ==


For much of history, the modern understanding of extinction as the end of a species was incompatible with the prevailing worldview. Prior to the 19th century, much of Western society adhered to the belief that the world was created by God and as such was complete and perfect. This concept reached its heyday in the 1700s with the peak popularity of a theological concept called the great chain of being, in which all life on earth, from the tiniest microorganism to God, is linked in a continuous chain. The extinction of a species was impossible under this model, as it would create gaps or missing links in the chain and destroy the natural order. Thomas Jefferson was a firm supporter of the great chain of being and an opponent of extinction, famously denying the extinction of the woolly mammoth on the grounds that nature never allows a race of animals to become extinct.

A series of fossils were discovered in the late 17th century that appeared unlike any living species. As a result, the scientific community embarked on a voyage of creative rationalization, seeking to understand what had happened to these species within a framework that did not account for total extinction. In October 1686, Robert Hooke presented an impression of a nautilus to the Royal Society that was more than two feet in diameter, and morphologically distinct from any known living species. Hooke theorized that this was simply because the species lived in the deep ocean and no one had discovered them yet. While he contended that it was possible a species could be &quot;lost&quot;, he thought this highly unlikely. Similarly, in 1695, Sir Thomas Molyneux published an account of enormous antlers found in Ireland that did not belong to any extant taxa in that area. Molyneux reasoned that they came from the North American moose and that the animal had once been common on the British Isles. Rather than suggest that this indicated the possibility of species going extinct, he argued that although organisms could become locally extinct, they could never be entirely lost and would continue to exist in some unknown region of the globe. The antlers were later confirmed to be from the extinct deer &quot;Megaloceros&quot;. Hooke and Molyneux&#x27;s line of thinking was difficult to disprove. When parts of the world had not been thoroughly examined and charted, scientists could not rule out that animals found only in the fossil record were not simply &quot;hiding&quot; in unexplored regions of the Earth.

Georges Cuvier is credited with establishing the modern conception of extinction in a 1796 lecture to the French Institute, though he would spend most of his career trying to convince the wider scientific community of his theory. Cuvier was a well-regarded geologist, lauded for his ability to reconstruct the anatomy of an unknown species from a few fragments of bone. His primary evidence for extinction came from mammoth skulls found near Paris. Cuvier recognized them as distinct from any known living species of elephant, and argued that it was highly unlikely such an enormous animal would go undiscovered. In 1798, he studied a fossil from the Paris Basin that was first observed by Robert de Lamanon in 1782, first hypothesizing that it belonged to a canine but then deciding that it instead belonged to an animal that was unlike living ones. His study paved the way to his naming of the extinct mammal genus &quot;Palaeotherium&quot; in 1804 based on the skull and additional fossil material along with another extinct contemporary mammal genus &quot;Anoplotherium&quot;. In both genera, he noticed that their fossils shared some similarities with other mammals like ruminants and rhinoceroses but still had distinct differences. In 1812, Cuvier, along with Alexandre Brongniart and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, mapped the strata of the Paris basin. They saw alternating saltwater and freshwater deposits, as well as patterns of the appearance and disappearance of fossils throughout the record. From these patterns, Cuvier inferred historic cycles of catastrophic flooding, extinction, and repopulation of the earth with new species.

Cuvier&#x27;s fossil evidence showed that very different life forms existed in the past than those that exist today, a fact that was accepted by most scientists. The primary debate focused on whether this turnover caused by extinction was gradual or abrupt in nature. Cuvier understood extinction to be the result of cataclysmic events that wipe out huge numbers of species, as opposed to the gradual decline of a species over time. His catastrophic view of the nature of extinction garnered him many opponents in the newly emerging school of uniformitarianism.

Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, a gradualist and colleague of Cuvier, saw the fossils of different life forms as evidence of the mutable character of species. While Lamarck did not deny the possibility of extinction, he believed that it was exceptional and rare and that most of the change in species over time was due to gradual change. Unlike Cuvier, Lamarck was skeptical that catastrophic events of a scale large enough to cause total extinction were possible. In his geological history of the earth titled Hydrogeologie, Lamarck instead argued that the surface of the earth was shaped by gradual erosion and deposition by water, and that species changed over time in response to the changing environment.

Charles Lyell, a noted geologist and founder of uniformitarianism, believed that past processes should be understood using present day processes. Like Lamarck, Lyell acknowledged that extinction could occur, noting the total extinction of the dodo and the extirpation of indigenous horses to the British Isles. He similarly argued against mass extinctions, believing that any extinction must be a gradual process. Lyell also showed that Cuvier&#x27;s original interpretation of the Parisian strata was incorrect. Instead of the catastrophic floods inferred by Cuvier, Lyell demonstrated that patterns of saltwater and freshwater deposits, like those seen in the Paris basin, could be formed by a slow rise and fall of sea levels.

The concept of extinction was integral to Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, with less fit lineages disappearing over time. For Darwin, extinction was a constant side effect of competition. Because of the wide reach of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, it was widely accepted that extinction occurred gradually and evenly (a concept now referred to as background extinction). It was not until 1982, when David Raup and Jack Sepkoski published their seminal paper on mass extinctions, that Cuvier was vindicated and catastrophic extinction was accepted as an important mechanism. The current understanding of extinction is a synthesis of the cataclysmic extinction events proposed by Cuvier, and the background extinction events proposed by Lyell and Darwin.

== Human attitudes and interests ==
Extinction is an important research topic in the field of zoology, and biology in general, and has also become an area of concern outside the scientific community. A number of organizations, such as the Worldwide Fund for Nature, have been created with the goal of preserving species from extinction. Governments have attempted, through enacting laws, to avoid habitat destruction, agricultural over-harvesting, and pollution. While many human-caused extinctions have been accidental, humans have also engaged in the deliberate destruction of some species, such as dangerous viruses, and the total destruction of other problematic species has been suggested. Other species were deliberately driven to extinction, or nearly so, due to poaching or because they were &quot;undesirable&quot;, or to push for other human agendas. One example was the near extinction of the American bison, which was nearly wiped out by mass hunts sanctioned by the United States government, to force the removal of Native Americans, many of whom relied on the bison for food.

Biologist Bruce Walsh states three reasons for scientific interest in the preservation of species: genetic resources, ecosystem stability, and ethics; and today the scientific community &quot;stress[es] the importance&quot; of maintaining biodiversity.

In modern times, commercial and industrial interests often have to contend with the effects of production on plant and animal life. However, some technologies with minimal, or no, proven harmful effects on &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; can be devastating to wildlife (for example, DDT). Biogeographer Jared Diamond notes that while big business may label environmental concerns as &quot;exaggerated&quot;, and often cause &quot;devastating damage&quot;, some corporations find it in their interest to adopt good conservation practices, and even engage in preservation efforts that surpass those taken by national parks.

Governments sometimes see the loss of native species as a loss to ecotourism, and can enact laws with severe punishment against the trade in native species in an effort to prevent extinction in the wild. Nature preserves are created by governments as a means to provide continuing habitats to species crowded by human expansion. The 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity has resulted in international Biodiversity Action Plan programmes, which attempt to provide comprehensive guidelines for government biodiversity conservation. Advocacy groups, such as The Wildlands Project and the Alliance for Zero Extinctions, work to educate the public and pressure governments into action.

People who live close to nature can be dependent on the survival of all the species in their environment, leaving them highly exposed to extinction risks. However, people prioritize day-to-day survival over species conservation; with human overpopulation in tropical developing countries, there has been enormous pressure on forests due to subsistence agriculture, including slash-and-burn agricultural techniques that can reduce endangered species&#x27;s habitats.

Antinatalist philosopher David Benatar concludes that any popular concern about non-human species extinction usually arises out of concern about how the loss of a species will impact human wants and needs, that &quot;we shall live in a world impoverished by the loss of one aspect of faunal diversity, that we shall no longer be able to behold or use that species of animal.&quot; He notes that typical concerns about possible human extinction, such as the loss of individual members, are not considered in regards to non-human species extinction. Anthropologist Jason Hickel speculates that the reason humanity seems largely indifferent to anthropogenic mass species extinction is that we see ourselves as separate from the natural world and the organisms within it. He says that this is due in part to the logic of capitalism: &quot;that the world is not really alive, and it is certainly not our kin, but rather just stuff to be extracted and discarded – and that includes most of the human beings living here too.&quot;

=== Planned extinction ===
==== Completed ====
* The smallpox virus is now extinct in the wild, although samples are retained in laboratory settings.
* The rinderpest virus, which infected domestic cattle, is now extinct in the wild.

==== Proposed ====
===== Disease agents =====
The poliovirus is now confined to small parts of the world due to extermination efforts.

&quot;Dracunculus medinensis&quot;, or Guinea worm, a parasitic worm which causes the disease dracunculiasis, is now close to eradication thanks to efforts led by the Carter Center.

&quot;Treponema pallidum pertenue&quot;, a bacterium which causes the disease yaws, is in the process of being eradicated.

===== Disease vectors =====
Biologist Olivia Judson has advocated the deliberate extinction of certain disease-carrying mosquito species. In a September 25, 2003 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, she advocated &quot;specicide&quot; of thirty mosquito species by introducing a genetic element that can insert itself into another crucial gene, to create recessive &quot;knockout genes&quot;. She says that the &quot;Anopheles&quot; mosquitoes (which spread malaria) and &quot;Aedes&quot; mosquitoes (which spread dengue fever, yellow fever, elephantiasis, and other diseases) represent only 30 of around 3,500 mosquito species; eradicating these would save at least one million human lives per year, at a cost of reducing the genetic diversity of the family Culicidae by only 1%. She further argues that since species become extinct &quot;all the time&quot; the disappearance of a few more will not destroy the ecosystem: &quot;We&#x27;re not left with a wasteland every time a species vanishes. Removing one species sometimes causes shifts in the populations of other species—but different need not mean worse.&quot; In addition, anti-malarial and mosquito control programs offer little realistic hope to the 300 million people in developing nations who will be infected with acute illnesses this year. Although trials are ongoing, she writes that if they fail &quot;we should consider the ultimate swatting.&quot;

Biologist E. O. Wilson has advocated the eradication of several species of mosquito, including malaria vector &quot;Anopheles gambiae&quot;. Wilson stated, &quot;I&#x27;m talking about a very small number of species that have co-evolved with us and are preying on humans, so it would certainly be acceptable to remove them. I believe it&#x27;s just common sense.&quot;

There have been many campaigns – some successful – to locally eradicate tsetse flies and their trypanosomes in areas, countries, and islands of Africa (including Príncipe). There are currently serious efforts to do away with them all across Africa, and this is generally viewed as beneficial and morally necessary, although not always.

=== Cloning ===

Some, such as Harvard geneticist George M. Church, believe that ongoing technological advances will let us &quot;bring back to life&quot; an extinct species by cloning, using DNA from the remains of that species. Proposed targets for cloning include the mammoth, the thylacine, and the Pyrenean ibex. For this to succeed, enough individuals would have to be cloned, from the DNA of different individuals (in the case of sexually reproducing organisms) to create a viable population. Though bioethical and philosophical objections have been raised, the cloning of extinct creatures seems theoretically possible.

In 2003, scientists tried to clone the extinct Pyrenean ibex (&quot;C. p. pyrenaica&quot;). This attempt failed: of the 285 embryos reconstructed, 54 were transferred to 12 Spanish ibexes and ibex–domestic goat hybrids, but only two survived the initial two months of gestation before they, too, died. In 2009, a second attempt was made to clone the Pyrenean ibex: one clone was born alive, but died seven minutes later, due to physical defects in the lungs.

<text>Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS, pronounced &quot;sea-moss
&quot;, , ) is a type of metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) fabrication process that uses complementary and symmetrical pairs of p-type and n-type MOSFETs for logic functions. CMOS technology is used for constructing integrated circuit (IC) chips, including microprocessors, microcontrollers, memory chips (including CMOS BIOS), and other digital logic circuits. CMOS technology is also used for analog circuits such as image sensors (CMOS sensors), data converters, RF circuits (RF CMOS), and highly integrated transceivers for many types of communication.

In 1948, Bardeen and Brattain patented an insulated-gate transistor (IGFET) with an inversion layer. Bardeen&#x27;s concept forms the basis of CMOS technology today. The CMOS process was presented by Fairchild Semiconductor&#x27;s Frank Wanlass and Chih-Tang Sah at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference in 1963. Wanlass later filed for CMOS circuitry and it was granted in 1967.  commercialized the technology with the trademark &quot;COS-MOS&quot; in the late 1960s, forcing other manufacturers to find another name, leading to &quot;CMOS&quot; becoming the standard name for the technology by the early 1970s. CMOS overtook NMOS logic as the dominant MOSFET fabrication process for very large-scale integration (VLSI) chips in the 1980s, also replacing earlier transistor–transistor logic (TTL) technology. CMOS has since remained the standard fabrication process for MOSFET semiconductor devices in VLSI chips. , 99% of IC chips, including most digital, analog and mixed-signal ICs, were fabricated using CMOS technology.

Two important characteristics of CMOS devices are high noise immunity and low static power consumption.
Since one transistor of the MOSFET pair is always off, the series combination draws significant power only momentarily during switching between on and off states. Consequently, CMOS devices do not produce as much waste heat as other forms of logic, like NMOS logic or transistor–transistor logic (TTL), which normally have some standing current even when not changing state. These characteristics allow CMOS to integrate a high density of logic functions on a chip. It was primarily for this reason that CMOS became the most widely used technology to be implemented in VLSI chips.

The phrase &quot;metal–oxide–semiconductor&quot; is a reference to the physical structure of MOS field-effect transistors, having a metal gate electrode placed on top of an oxide insulator, which in turn is on top of a semiconductor material. Aluminium was once used but now the material is polysilicon. Other metal gates have made a comeback with the advent of high-κ dielectric materials in the CMOS process, as announced by IBM and Intel for the 45 nanometer node and smaller sizes.

== History ==
The principle of complementary symmetry was first introduced by George Sziklai in 1953 who then discussed several complementary bipolar circuits. Paul Weimer, also at RCA, invented in 1962 thin-film transistor (TFT) complementary circuits, a close relative of CMOS. He invented complementary flip-flop and inverter circuits, but did no work in a more complex complementary logic. He was the first person able to put p-channel and n-channel TFTs in a circuit on the same substrate. Three years earlier, John T. Wallmark and Sanford M. Marcus published a variety of complex logic functions implemented as integrated circuits using JFETs, including complementary memory circuits. Frank Wanlass was familiar with work done by Weimer at RCA.

In 1955, Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derick accidentally grew a layer of silicon dioxide over the silicon wafer, for which they observed surface passivation effects. By 1957 Frosch and Derrick, using masking and predeposition, were able to manufacture silicon dioxide transistors and showed that silicon dioxide insulated, protected silicon wafers and prevented dopants from diffusing into the wafer. J.R. Ligenza and W.G. Spitzer studied the mechanism of thermally grown oxides and fabricated a high quality Si/SiO2 stack in 1960.

Following this research, Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng proposed a silicon MOS transistor in 1959 and successfully demonstrated a working MOS device with their Bell Labs team in 1960. Their team included E. E. LaBate and E. I. Povilonis who fabricated the device; M. O. Thurston, L. A. D&#x27;Asaro, and J. R. Ligenza who developed the diffusion processes, and H. K. Gummel and R. Lindner who characterized the device. There were originally two types of MOSFET logic, PMOS (p-type MOS) and NMOS (n-type MOS). Both types were developed by Frosch and Derrick in 1957 at Bell Labs.

In 1948, Bardeen and Brattain patented the progenitor of MOSFET, an insulated-gate FET (IGFET) with an inversion layer. Bardeen&#x27;s patent, and the concept of an inversion layer, forms the basis of CMOS technology today. A new type of MOSFET logic combining both the PMOS and NMOS processes was developed, called complementary MOS (CMOS), by Chih-Tang Sah and Frank Wanlass at Fairchild. In February 1963, they published the invention in a research paper. In both the research paper and the patent filed by Wanlass, the fabrication of CMOS devices was outlined, on the basis of thermal oxidation of a silicon substrate to yield a layer of silicon dioxide located between the drain contact and the source contact.

CMOS was commercialised by RCA in the late 1960s. RCA adopted CMOS for the design of integrated circuits (ICs), developing CMOS circuits for an Air Force computer in 1965 and then a 288-bit CMOS SRAM memory chip in 1968. RCA also used CMOS for its 4000-series integrated circuits in 1968, starting with a 20μm semiconductor manufacturing process before gradually scaling to a 10 μm process over the next several years.

CMOS technology was initially overlooked by the American semiconductor industry in favour of NMOS, which was more powerful at the time. However, CMOS was quickly adopted and further advanced by Japanese semiconductor manufacturers due to its low power consumption, leading to the rise of the Japanese semiconductor industry. Toshiba developed C2MOS (Clocked CMOS), a circuit technology with lower power consumption and faster operating speed than ordinary CMOS, in 1969. Toshiba used its C2MOS technology to develop a large-scale integration (LSI) chip for Sharp&#x27;s Elsi Mini LED pocket calculator, developed in 1971 and released in 1972. Suwa Seikosha (now Seiko Epson) began developing a CMOS IC chip for a Seiko quartz watch in 1969, and began mass-production with the launch of the Seiko Analog Quartz 38SQW watch in 1971. The first mass-produced CMOS consumer electronic product was the Hamilton Pulsar &quot;Wrist Computer&quot; digital watch, released in 1970. Due to low power consumption, CMOS logic has been widely used for calculators and watches since the 1970s.

The earliest microprocessors in the early 1970s were PMOS processors, which initially dominated the early microprocessor industry. By the late 1970s, NMOS microprocessors had overtaken PMOS processors. CMOS microprocessors were introduced in 1975, with the Intersil 6100, and RCA CDP 1801. However, CMOS processors did not become dominant until the 1980s.

CMOS was initially slower than NMOS logic, thus NMOS was more widely used for computers in the 1970s. The Intel 5101 (1kb SRAM) CMOS memory chip (1974) had an access time of 800ns, whereas the fastest NMOS chip at the time, the Intel 2147 (4kb SRAM) HMOS memory chip (1976), had an access time of 55/70ns. In 1978, a Hitachi research team led by Toshiaki Masuhara introduced the twin-well Hi-CMOS process, with its HM6147 (4kb SRAM) memory chip, manufactured with a 3 μm process. The Hitachi HM6147 chip was able to match the performance (55/70ns access) of the Intel 2147 HMOS chip, while the HM6147 also consumed significantly less power (15mA) than the 2147 (110mA). With comparable performance and much less power consumption, the twin-well CMOS process eventually overtook NMOS as the most common semiconductor manufacturing process for computers in the 1980s.

In the 1980s, CMOS microprocessors overtook NMOS microprocessors. NASA&#x27;s Galileo spacecraft, sent to orbit Jupiter in 1989, used the RCA 1802 CMOS microprocessor due to low power consumption.

Intel introduced a 1.5 μm process for CMOS semiconductor device fabrication in 1983. In the mid-1980s, Bijan Davari of IBM developed high-performance, low-voltage, deep sub-micron CMOS technology, which enabled the development of faster computers as well as portable computers and battery-powered handheld electronics. In 1988, Davari led an IBM team that demonstrated a high-performance 250 nanometer CMOS process.

Fujitsu commercialized a 700nm CMOS process in 1987, and then Hitachi, Mitsubishi Electric, NEC and Toshiba commercialized 500nm CMOS in 1989. In 1993, Sony commercialized a 350nm CMOS process, while Hitachi and NEC commercialized 250nm CMOS. Hitachi introduced a 160nm CMOS process in 1995, then Mitsubishi introduced 150nm CMOS in 1996, and then Samsung Electronics introduced 140nm in 1999.

In 2000, Gurtej Singh Sandhu and Trung T. Doan at Micron Technology invented atomic layer deposition High-κ dielectric films, leading to the development of a cost-effective 90 nm CMOS process. Toshiba and Sony developed a 65 nm CMOS process in 2002, and then TSMC initiated the development of 45 nm CMOS logic in 2004. The development of pitch double patterning by Gurtej Singh Sandhu at Micron Technology led to the development of 30nm class CMOS in the 2000s.

CMOS is used in most modern LSI and VLSI devices. As of 2010, CPUs with the best performance per watt each year have been CMOS static logic since 1976. As of 2019, planar CMOS technology is still the most common form of semiconductor device fabrication, but is gradually being replaced by non-planar FinFET technology, which is capable of manufacturing semiconductor nodes smaller than 20nm.

== Technical details ==
&quot;CMOS&quot; refers to both a particular style of digital circuitry design and the family of processes used to implement that circuitry on integrated circuits (chips). CMOS circuitry dissipates less power than logic families with resistive loads. Since this advantage has increased and grown more important, CMOS processes and variants have come to dominate, thus the vast majority of modern integrated circuit manufacturing is on CMOS processes. CMOS logic consumes around one seventh the power of NMOS logic, and about 10 million times less power than bipolar transistor-transistor logic (TTL).

CMOS circuits use a combination of p-type and n-type metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFETs) to implement logic gates and other digital circuits. Although CMOS logic can be implemented with discrete devices for demonstrations, commercial CMOS products are integrated circuits composed of up to billions of transistors of both types, on a rectangular piece of silicon of often between 10 and 400 mm2.

CMOS always uses all enhancement-mode MOSFETs (in other words, a zero gate-to-source voltage turns the transistor off).

== Inversion ==
CMOS circuits are constructed in such a way that all P-type metal–oxide–semiconductor (PMOS) transistors must have either an input from the voltage source or from another PMOS transistor. Similarly, all NMOS transistors must have either an input from ground or from another NMOS transistor. The composition of a PMOS transistor creates low resistance between its source and drain contacts when a low gate voltage is applied and high resistance when a high gate voltage is applied. On the other hand, the composition of an NMOS transistor creates high resistance between source and drain when a low gate voltage is applied and low resistance when a high gate voltage is applied. CMOS accomplishes current reduction by complementing every nMOSFET with a pMOSFET and connecting both gates and both drains together. A high voltage on the gates will cause the nMOSFET to conduct and the pMOSFET not to conduct, while a low voltage on the gates causes the reverse. This arrangement greatly reduces power consumption and heat generation. However, during the switching time, both pMOS and nMOS MOSFETs conduct briefly as the gate voltage transitions from one state to another. This induces a brief spike in power consumption and becomes a serious issue at high frequencies.
The adjacent image shows what happens when an input is connected to both a PMOS transistor (top of diagram) and an NMOS transistor (bottom of diagram). Vdd is some positive voltage connected to a power supply and Vss is ground. A is the input and Q is the output.

When the voltage of A is low (i.e. close to Vss), the NMOS transistor&#x27;s channel is in a high resistance state, disconnecting Vss from Q. The PMOS transistor&#x27;s channel is in a low resistance state, connecting Vdd to Q. Q, therefore, registers Vdd.

On the other hand, when the voltage of A is high (i.e. close to Vdd), the PMOS transistor is in a high resistance state, disconnecting Vdd from Q. The NMOS transistor is in a low resistance state, connecting Vss to Q. Now, Q registers Vss.

In short, the outputs of the PMOS and NMOS transistors are complementary such that when the input is low, the output is high, and when the input is high, the output is low. No matter what the input is, the output is never left floating (charge is never stored due to wire capacitance and lack of electrical drain/ground). Because of this behavior of input and output, the CMOS circuit&#x27;s output is the inverse of the input.

The transistors&#x27; resistances are never exactly equal to zero or infinity, so Q will never exactly equal Vss or Vdd, but Q will always be closer to Vss than A was to Vdd (or vice versa if A were close to Vss). Without this amplification, there would be a very low limit to the number of logic gates that could be chained together in series, and CMOS logic with billions of transistors would be impossible.

=== Power supply pins ===

The power supply pins for CMOS are called VDD and VSS, or VCC and Ground(GND) depending on the manufacturer. VDD and VSS are carryovers from conventional MOS circuits and stand for the &quot;drain&quot; and &quot;source&quot; supplies. These do not apply directly to CMOS, since both supplies are really source supplies. VCC and Ground are carryovers from TTL logic and that nomenclature has been retained with the introduction of the 54C/74C line of CMOS.

=== Duality ===
An important characteristic of a CMOS circuit is the duality that exists between its PMOS transistors and NMOS transistors. A CMOS circuit is created to allow a path always to exist from the output to either the power source or ground. To accomplish this, the set of all paths to the voltage source must be the complement of the set of all paths to ground. This can be easily accomplished by defining one in terms of the NOT of the other. Due to the logic based on De Morgan&#x27;s laws, the PMOS transistors in parallel have corresponding NMOS transistors in series while the PMOS transistors in series have corresponding NMOS transistors in parallel.

=== Logic ===
More complex logic functions such as those involving AND and OR gates require manipulating the paths between gates to represent the logic. When a path consists of two transistors in series, both transistors must have low resistance to the corresponding supply voltage, modelling an AND. When a path consists of two transistors in parallel, either one or both of the transistors must have low resistance to connect the supply voltage to the output, modelling an OR.

Shown on the right is a circuit diagram of a NAND gate in CMOS logic. If both of the A and B inputs are high, then both the NMOS transistors (bottom half of the diagram) will conduct, neither of the PMOS transistors (top half) will conduct, and a conductive path will be established between the output and &quot;V&quot;ss (ground), bringing the output low. If both of the A and B inputs are low, then neither of the NMOS transistors will conduct, while both of the PMOS transistors will conduct, establishing a conductive path between the output and &quot;V&quot;dd (voltage source), bringing the output high. If either of the A or B inputs is low, one of the NMOS transistors will not conduct, one of the PMOS transistors will, and a conductive path will be established between the output and &quot;V&quot;dd (voltage source), bringing the output high. As the only configuration of the two inputs that results in a low output is when both are high, this circuit implements a NAND (NOT AND) logic gate.

An advantage of CMOS over NMOS logic is that both low-to-high and high-to-low output transitions are fast since the (PMOS) pull-up transistors have low resistance when switched on, unlike the load resistors in NMOS logic. In addition, the output signal swings the full voltage between the low and high rails. This strong, more nearly symmetric response also makes CMOS more resistant to noise.

See Logical effort for a method of calculating delay in a CMOS circuit.

=== Example: NAND gate in physical layout ===

This example shows a NAND logic device drawn as a physical representation as it would be manufactured. The physical layout perspective is a &quot;bird&#x27;s eye view&quot; of a stack of layers. The circuit is constructed on a P-type substrate. The polysilicon, diffusion, and n-well are referred to as &quot;base layers&quot; and are actually inserted into trenches of the P-type substrate. (See steps 1 to 6 in the process diagram below right) The contacts penetrate an insulating layer between the base layers and the first layer of metal (metal1) making a connection.

The inputs to the NAND (illustrated in green color) are in polysilicon. The transistors (devices) are formed by the intersection of the polysilicon and diffusion; N diffusion for the N device &amp; P diffusion for the P device (illustrated in salmon and yellow coloring respectively). The output (&quot;out&quot;) is connected together in metal (illustrated in cyan coloring). Connections between metal and polysilicon or diffusion are made through contacts (illustrated as black squares). The physical layout example matches the NAND logic circuit given in the previous example.

The N device is manufactured on a P-type substrate while the P device is manufactured in an N-type well (n-well). A P-type substrate &quot;tap&quot; is connected to VSS and an N-type n-well tap is connected to VDD to prevent latchup.

== Power: switching and leakage ==
CMOS logic dissipates less power than NMOS logic circuits because CMOS dissipates power only when switching (&quot;dynamic power&quot;). On a typical ASIC in a modern 90 nanometer process, switching the output might take 120 picoseconds, and happens once every ten nanoseconds. NMOS logic dissipates power whenever the transistor is on, because there is a current path from Vdd to Vss through the load resistor and the n-type network.

Static CMOS gates are very power efficient because they dissipate nearly zero power when idle. Earlier, the power consumption of CMOS devices was not the major concern while designing chips. Factors like speed and area dominated the design parameters. As the CMOS technology moved below sub-micron levels the power consumption per unit area of the chip has risen tremendously.

Broadly classifying, power dissipation in CMOS circuits occurs because of two components, static and dynamic:

=== Static dissipation ===

Both NMOS and PMOS transistors have a gate–source threshold voltage (Vth), below which the current (called &quot;sub threshold&quot; current) through the device will drop exponentially. Historically, CMOS circuits operated at supply voltages much larger than their threshold voltages (Vdd might have been 5 V, and Vth for both NMOS and PMOS might have been 700 mV). A special type of the transistor used in some CMOS circuits is the native transistor, with near zero threshold voltage.

SiO2 is a good insulator, but at very small thickness levels electrons can tunnel across the very thin insulation; the probability drops off exponentially with oxide thickness. Tunnelling current becomes very important for transistors below 130 nm technology with gate oxides of 20 Å or thinner.

Small reverse leakage currents are formed due to formation of reverse bias between diffusion regions and wells (for e.g., p-type diffusion vs. n-well), wells and substrate (for e.g., n-well vs. p-substrate). In modern process diode leakage is very small compared to sub threshold and tunnelling currents, so these may be neglected during power calculations.

If the ratios do not match, then there might be different currents of PMOS and NMOS; this may lead to imbalance and thus improper current causes the CMOS to heat up and dissipate power unnecessarily. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that leakage power reduces due to aging effects as a trade-off for devices to become slower.

To speed up designs, manufacturers have switched to constructions that have lower voltage thresholds but because of this a modern NMOS transistor with a Vth of 200 mV has a significant subthreshold leakage current. Designs (e.g. desktop processors) which include vast numbers of circuits which are not actively switching still consume power because of this leakage current. Leakage power is a significant portion of the total power consumed by such designs. Multi-threshold CMOS (MTCMOS), now available from foundries, is one approach to managing leakage power. With MTCMOS, high Vth transistors are used when switching speed is not critical, while low Vth transistors are used in speed sensitive paths. Further technology advances that use even thinner gate dielectrics have an additional leakage component because of current tunnelling through the extremely thin gate dielectric. Using high-κ dielectrics instead of silicon dioxide that is the conventional gate dielectric allows similar device performance, but with a thicker gate insulator, thus avoiding this current. Leakage power reduction using new material and system designs is critical to sustaining scaling of CMOS.

=== Dynamic dissipation ===

==== Charging and discharging of load capacitances ====
CMOS circuits dissipate power by charging the various load capacitances (mostly gate and wire capacitance, but also drain and some source capacitances) whenever they are switched. In one complete cycle of CMOS logic, current flows from VDD to the load capacitance to charge it and then flows from the charged load capacitance (CL) to ground during discharge. Therefore, in one complete charge/discharge cycle, a total of Q=CLVDD is thus transferred from VDD to ground. Multiply by the switching frequency on the load capacitances to get the current used, and multiply by the average voltage again to get the characteristic switching power dissipated by a CMOS device: formula_1.

Since most gates do not operate/switch at every clock cycle, they are often accompanied by a factor formula_2, called the activity factor. Now, the dynamic power dissipation may be re-written as formula_3.

A clock in a system has an activity factor α=1, since it rises and falls every cycle. Most data has an activity factor of 0.1. If correct load capacitance is estimated on a node together with its activity factor, the dynamic power dissipation at that node can be calculated effectively.

==== Short-circuit power ====
Since there is a finite rise/fall time for both pMOS and nMOS, during transition, for example, from off to on, both the transistors will be on for a small period of time in which current will find a path directly from VDD to ground, hence creating a short-circuit current, sometimes called a &quot;crowbar&quot; current. Short-circuit power dissipation increases with the rise and fall time of the transistors.

This form of power consumption became significant in the 1990s as wires on chip became narrower and the long wires became more resistive. CMOS gates at the end of those resistive wires see slow input transitions. Careful design which avoids weakly driven long skinny wires reduces this effect, but crowbar power can be a substantial part of dynamic CMOS power.

== Input protection ==
Parasitic transistors that are inherent in the CMOS structure may be turned on by input signals outside the normal operating range, e.g. electrostatic discharges or line reflections. The resulting latch-up may damage or destroy the CMOS device. Clamp diodes are included in CMOS circuits to deal with these signals. Manufacturers&#x27; data sheets specify the maximum permitted current that may flow through the diodes.

== Analog CMOS ==
Besides digital applications, CMOS technology is also used in analog applications. For example, there are CMOS operational amplifier ICs available in the market. Transmission gates may be used as analog multiplexers instead of signal relays. CMOS technology is also widely used for RF circuits all the way to microwave frequencies, in mixed-signal (analog+digital) applications.

=== RF CMOS ===
RF CMOS refers to RF circuits (radio frequency circuits) which are based on mixed-signal CMOS integrated circuit technology. They are widely used in wireless telecommunication technology. RF CMOS was developed by Asad Abidi while working at UCLA in the late 1980s. This changed the way in which RF circuits were designed, leading to the replacement of discrete bipolar transistors with CMOS integrated circuits in radio transceivers. It enabled sophisticated, low-cost and portable end-user terminals, and gave rise to small, low-cost, low-power and portable units for a wide range of wireless communication systems. This enabled &quot;anytime, anywhere&quot; communication and helped bring about the wireless revolution, leading to the rapid growth of the wireless industry.

The baseband processors and radio transceivers in all modern wireless networking devices and mobile phones are mass-produced using RF CMOS devices. RF CMOS circuits are widely used to transmit and receive wireless signals, in a variety of applications, such as satellite technology (such as GPS), bluetooth, Wi-Fi, near-field communication (NFC), mobile networks (such as 3G and 4G), terrestrial broadcast, and automotive radar applications, among other uses.

Examples of commercial RF CMOS chips include Intel&#x27;s DECT cordless phone, and 802.11 (Wi-Fi) chips created by Atheros and other companies. Commercial RF CMOS products are also used for Bluetooth and Wireless LAN (WLAN) networks. RF CMOS is also used in the radio transceivers for wireless standards such as GSM, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, transceivers for mobile networks such as 3G, and remote units in wireless sensor networks (WSN).

RF CMOS technology is crucial to modern wireless communications, including wireless networks and mobile communication devices. One of the companies that commercialized RF CMOS technology was Infineon. Its bulk CMOS RF switches sell over 1billion units annually, reaching a cumulative 5billion units, .

== Temperature range ==
Conventional CMOS devices work over a range of −55 °C to +125 °C.

There were theoretical indications as early as August 2008 that silicon CMOS will work down to −233 °C (40 K). Functioning temperatures near 40 K have since been achieved using overclocked AMD Phenom II processors with a combination of liquid nitrogen and liquid helium cooling.

Silicon carbide CMOS devices have been tested for a year at 500 °C.

== Single-electron MOS transistors ==
Ultra small (L = 20 nm, W = 20 nm) MOSFETs achieve the single-electron limit when operated at cryogenic temperature over a range of −269 °C (4 K) to about −258 °C (15 K). The transistor displays Coulomb blockade due to progressive charging of electrons one by one. The number of electrons confined in the channel is driven by the gate voltage, starting from an occupation of zero electrons, and it can be set to one or many.

<text>Robert Abercromby (1536 – 27 April 1613), whose surname was also spelled as Abrecromby and Abercrombie, and was known by such pseudonyms as Robert Sandiesoun and Sanders Robertson, was a Scottish Jesuit missionary.

==Early life==
He was born and educated in Scotland, and studied in the Collegium Romanum in Rome, where on 19 August 1563 he became a Jesuit. From 1564 he lived in Braunsberg (then in Royal Prussia; present-day Braniewo) where he was professor of grammar in the biggest Polish Jesuit &quot;collegium&quot; (where teaching was in Latin) and a novice master.

In 1565 he was ordained a priest. In Braniewo he was in constant contact with Stanislaus Hosius. Learning Polish was difficult for him, and he had some problems with the finances of the school. Due to these problems he was permitted to leave Poland in 1580, when he met the Scottish king for the first time. In September 1580 he went back to Poland - from 1580 to 1587 he performed similar tasks in Kraków, Poznań and Wilno.

In 1587 he left Poland and returned to Scotland. During the journey to Scotland in 1580 and during his second stay there he was organizing transports of Scottish Catholic novices to be trained in Polish schools and seminaries.

==Contact with Anne of Denmark==
Abercromby claimed that he had reconciled Anne of Denmark, queen of James VI of Scotland, to the Catholic Church. James apparently allowed Abercromby to meet her at Holyroodhouse circa 1599. She made no outward sign of a change of religion.

==Later life==
Abercromby remained in Scotland for some time, but a price of 10,000 crowns was put upon his head. He spent the period 1601–06 under the protection of George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly.

Abercromby went back to Braunsberg in 1606. His name was connected to the allegiance oath controversy when a pamphlet &quot;pasquil&quot;, &quot;Exetasis epistolæ nomine regis&quot;, written under the pseudonym Bartholus Pacenius against James I was traced to Braunsberg; but the investigation by Patrick Gordon was inconclusive. He died there on 27 April 1613.

<text>Francis Pharcellus Church (February 22, 1839 – April 11, 1906) was an American publisher and editor. In 1897, Church wrote the editorial &quot;Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus&quot;. Produced in response to eight-year-old Virginia O&#x27;Hanlon&#x27;s letter asking whether Santa Claus was real, the widely republished editorial has become one of the most famous ever written. 

Born in Rochester, New York, Church graduated from Columbia University and embarked on a career in journalism. With his brother, William Conant Church, Francis founded and edited several periodicals including &quot;The Army and Navy Journal&quot;, &quot;The Galaxy&quot;, and the &quot;Internal Revenue Record and Customs Journal&quot;. He was a war correspondent for &quot;The New York Times&quot; during the American Civil War. He worked at &quot;The Sun&quot; in the early 1860s and again from 1874 until his death, writing thousands of editorials.

Church died in New York City and was buried at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery.

==Early life and education==
Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Pharcellus Church was born in Rochester on February 22, 1839, to Pharcellus Church, a Baptist minister, and Chara Emily Church ( Conant). He had three sisters; an older brother, William Conant Church; and a younger brother, John Adams Church. As a child, Francis looked up to William &quot;as his &#x27;big brother&#x27; and was his &#x27;admiring satellite&#x27;.&quot; In 1848, the family moved to Boston, where Pharcellus preached at Bowdoin Square Baptist Church and edited the &quot;Watchman and Reflector,&quot; a weekly Baptist newspaper. In 1852, Pharcellus&#x27; health failed; he resigned his pastorship and moved the family to Chara&#x27;s home in Vermont. The following year, the family moved a final time, to Brooklyn. Francis began to attend Manhattan&#x27;s Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory School, whose headmaster was Charles Anthon. His education was centered around math and foreign languages.

Francis Church matriculated at Columbia College in New York City, where he graduated with honors in 1859. He earned a Master of Arts two years later. Although Church had entered university studying law and divinity, and spent a time studying under the judge Hooper C. Van Vorst, he soon switched his focus completely to writing and had graduated Columbia studying journalism.

==Writing and publishing career==

After graduation, Church found work at &quot;The New York Chronicle&quot;, which was published by his father and brother. For a time after William left to work at &quot;The Sun&quot;, Francis Church was the chief assistant at the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, but he eventually left to work at &quot;The Sun&quot; as well. In 1862, he covered the American Civil War for &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In 1863, Church, his brother William, and others established &quot;The Army and Navy Journal&quot; to promote loyalty to the Union during the Civil War and report on military affairs. During the war, Church worked for the &quot;Journal&quot; as a war correspondent, and from 1863 to 1865, he was an editor and publisher of the &quot;Journal&quot;. He remained co-publisher until 1874.

In 1866, the brothers founded the &quot;Galaxy&quot; literary magazine as a competitor to &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;; Church was a publisher for two years and an editor there until 1872 or 1878. The &quot;Dictionary of Literary Biography&quot; credits Francis with doing &quot;most of the editorial work.&quot; As editors, the brothers became known for their heavy-handed style, for instance cutting major parts of Rebecca Harding Davis&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for the Verdict&quot; when they serialized it. Supported by literary figures, notably Edmund Clarence Stedman, the brothers worked to attract the best authors possible to their publication, though they focused on New York authors and largely ignored the well-established literary society in New England. Stedman, while speaking about the editors in 1903, stated that the magazine focused on featuring authors from across the United States and did not focus on publishing works from popular authors. 

They published the magazine fortnightly for a year, then switched to a monthly format. In 1870, Church proposed that Mark Twain contribute a &quot;Memoranda&quot; column in the magazine, a request Twain accepted; he edited the column from May 1870 to March 1871. Altogether, the magazine published the work of more than 600 authors, including Rebecca Harding Davis, Henry James, John William De Forest, Rose Terry Cooke, John Esten Cooke, and Constance Fenimore Woolson. The magazine&#x27;s circulation peaked around 21,000 in 1871 and fell dramatically afterwards. The &quot;Galaxy&quot; merged with the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; in 1878.

Church also managed the &quot;Internal Revenue Record and Customs Journal&quot; with his brother from 1870 to 1895. He was re-hired as a part-time editor and writer at &quot;The Sun&quot; in 1874. He started working full-time there after leaving &quot;The Galaxy&quot;. In this capacity, Church published thousands of editorials, most of which attracted little note. One of his more popular editorials was in response to a maid asking about etiquette, after which Church wrote a series of additional replies to letters asking for advice. He continued to work for &quot;The Sun&quot; until his death in 1906.

Edward Page Mitchell, &quot;The Sun&quot; editor-in-chief, later said Church had &quot;a knowledge of journalistic history and an insight into journalistic character that could hardly be expected of any but a major figure in the profession.&quot; Mitchell also considered Church &quot;energetic and a brilliant conversationalist.&quot; An obituary published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Church as not being well known among literary circles because his reputation had been &quot;merged&quot; with that of &quot;The Sun&quot;, but among those who knew him he was &quot;highly and justly esteemed.&quot; It said his editorial style specialized in treating theological topics &quot;from a secular point of view.&quot;
 He disliked politics.

=== &quot;Yes, Virginia&quot; ===

In 1897, Mitchell gave Church a letter written to &quot;The Sun&quot; by 8-year-old Virginia O&#x27;Hanlon, who wanted to know whether there truly is a Santa Claus. In Church&#x27;s 416-word response, he wrote that Santa exists &quot;as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist&quot;. &quot;Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus&quot; became Church&#x27;s best-known work and the most reprinted editorial in newspaper history.

Mitchell reported that Church, who was initially reluctant to write a response, produced it &quot;in a short time&quot; during an afternoon. Upon publication on September 21, 1897, journalist Charles Anderson Dana described Church&#x27;s writing as &quot;Real literature,&quot; and said, &quot;Might be a good idea to reprint it every Christmasyes, and even tell who wrote it!&quot;

The editorial was first reprinted five years later to answer readers&#x27; demand for it. &quot;The Sun&quot; started reprinting the editorial annually in 1920 at Christmas, and continued until the paper&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1950. Because &quot;The Sun&quot; traditionally did not byline their editorials, Church was not known to be the author until his death in 1906. The editorial is just one of two whose authorship &quot;The Sun&quot; disclosed.

The editorial, which has been described as &quot;the most famous editorial in history&quot;, has been translated into 20 languages, set to music, and adapted into at least two movies. A book based on the editorial, &quot;Is there a Santa Claus&quot;?, was published in 1921.

== Personal life and death ==

In 1871, he married Elizabeth Wickham, who was from Philadelphia. In 1882 or 1883, Church moved from 107 East 35th Street to the Florence Apartment House, located at East 18th Street and East Union Place (now known as Park Avenue South). He and his wife lived there until 1890. They had no children.

He was a member of the Sons of the Revolution, the National Sculpture Society, and the Century Association.

Church died in New York City on April 11, 1906, at the age of 67, at his home on 46 East 30th Street. He had an unknown illness for several months before his death. He was buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York.

<doc id="49434" wikidata="Q191536" url="?curid=49434" title="Conjunction (astronomy)">
<text>In astronomy, a conjunction occurs when two astronomical objects or spacecraft appear to be close to each other in the sky. This means they have either the same right ascension or the same ecliptic longitude, usually as observed from Earth.

When two objects always appear close to the ecliptic—such as two planets, the Moon and a planet, or the Sun and a planet—this fact implies an apparent close approach between the objects as seen in the sky. A related word, &quot;appulse&quot;, is the minimum apparent separation in the sky of two astronomical objects.

Conjunctions involve either two objects in the Solar System or one object in the Solar System and a more distant object, such as a star. A conjunction is an apparent phenomenon caused by the observer&#x27;s perspective: the two objects involved are not actually close to one another in space. Conjunctions between two bright objects close to the ecliptic, such as two bright planets, can be seen with the naked eye.

The astronomical symbol for conjunction is (Unicode U+260C ☌). 
The conjunction symbol is not used in modern astronomy. It continues to be used in astrology.

==Passing close==
More generally, in the particular case of two planets, it means that they merely have the same right ascension (and hence the same hour angle). This is called conjunction in right ascension. However, there is also the term conjunction in ecliptic longitude. At such conjunction both objects have the same ecliptic longitude. Conjunction in right ascension and conjunction in ecliptic longitude do not normally take place at the same time, but in most cases nearly at the same time. However, at triple conjunctions, it is possible that a conjunction only in right ascension (or ecliptic length) occurs. At the time of conjunction – it does not matter if in right ascension or in ecliptic longitude – the involved planets are close together upon the celestial sphere. In the vast majority of such cases, one of the planets will appear to pass north or south of the other.

==Passing closer==

However, if two celestial bodies attain the same declination at the time of a conjunction in right ascension (or the same ecliptic latitude at a conjunction in ecliptic longitude), the one that is closer to the Earth will pass in front of the other. In such a case, a syzygy takes place. If one object moves into the shadow of another, the event is an eclipse. For example, if the Moon passes into the shadow of Earth and disappears from view, this event is called a lunar eclipse. If the visible disk of the nearer object is considerably smaller than that of the farther object, the event is called a transit. When Mercury passes in front of the Sun, it is a transit of Mercury, and when Venus passes in front of the Sun, it is a transit of Venus. When the nearer object appears larger than the farther one, it will completely obscure its smaller companion; this is called an occultation. An example of an occultation is when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, causing the Sun to disappear either entirely or partially. This phenomenon is commonly known as a solar eclipse. Occultations in which the larger body is neither the Sun nor the Moon are very rare. More frequent, however, is an occultation of a planet by the Moon. Several such events are visible every year from various places on Earth.

==Position of the observer==
A conjunction, as a phenomenon of perspective, is an event that involves two astronomical bodies seen by an observer on the Earth. Times and details depend only very slightly on the observer&#x27;s location on the Earth&#x27;s surface, with the differences being greatest for conjunctions involving the Moon because of its relative closeness, but even for the Moon the time of a conjunction never differs by more than a few hours.

==Superior and inferior conjunctions with the Sun==
As seen from a planet that is superior, if an inferior planet is on the opposite side of the Sun, it is in superior conjunction with the Sun. An inferior conjunction occurs when the two planets lie in a line on the same side of the Sun. In an inferior conjunction, the superior planet is &quot;in opposition&quot; to the Sun as seen from the inferior planet.

The terms &quot;inferior conjunction&quot; and &quot;superior conjunction&quot; are used in particular for the planets Mercury and Venus, which are inferior planets as seen from Earth. However, this definition can be applied to any pair of planets, as seen from the one farther from the Sun.

A planet (or asteroid or comet) is simply said to be in conjunction, when it is in conjunction with the Sun, as seen from Earth. The Moon is in conjunction with the Sun at New Moon.

==Multiple conjunctions and quasiconjunctions==
Conjunctions between two planets can be single, triple, or even quintuple. Quintuple conjunctions involve Mercury, because it moves rapidly east and west of the sun, in a synodic cycle just 116 days in length. An example will occur in 2048, when Venus, moving eastward behind the Sun, encounters Mercury five times (February 16, March 16, May 27, August 13, and September 5).

There is also a so-called quasiconjunction, when a planet in retrograde motion — always either Mercury or Venus, from the point of view of the Earth — will &quot;drop back&quot; in right ascension until it almost allows another planet to overtake it, but then the former planet will resume its forward motion and thereafter appear to draw away from it again. This will occur in the morning sky, before dawn. The reverse may happen in the evening sky after dusk, with Mercury or Venus entering retrograde motion just as it is about to overtake another planet (often Mercury &quot;and&quot; Venus are &quot;both&quot; of the planets involved, and when this situation arises they may remain in very close visual proximity for several days or even longer). The quasiconjunction is reckoned as occurring at the time the distance in right ascension between the two planets is smallest, even though, when declination is taken into account, they may appear closer together shortly before or after this.

==Average interval between conjunctions==

The interval between two conjunctions involving the same two planets is not constant, but the average interval between two similar conjunctions can be calculated from the periods of the planets. The &quot;speed&quot; at which a planet goes around the Sun, in terms of revolutions per time, is given by the inverse of its period, and the speed difference between two planets is the difference between these. For conjunctions of two planets beyond the orbit of Earth, the average time interval between two conjunctions is the time it takes for 360° to be covered by that speed difference, so the average interval is:
:formula_1
This does not apply of course to the intervals between the individual conjunctions of a triple conjunction.

Conjunctions between a planet inside the orbit of Earth (Venus or Mercury) and a planet outside are a bit more complicated. As the outer planet swings around from being in opposition to the Sun to being east of the Sun, then in superior conjunction with the Sun, then west of the Sun, and back to opposition, it will be in conjunction with Venus or Mercury an odd number of times. So the average interval between, say, the first conjunction of one set and the first of the next set will be equal to the average interval between its oppositions with the Sun. Conjunctions between Mercury and Mars are usually triple, and those between Mercury and planets beyond Mars may also be. Conjunctions between Venus and the planets beyond Earth may be single or triple.

As for conjunctions between Mercury and Venus, each time Venus goes from maximum elongation to the east of the Sun to maximum elongation west of the Sun and then back to east of the Sun (a so-called synodic cycle of Venus), an even number of conjunctions with Mercury take place. There are usually four, but sometimes just two, and sometimes six, as in the cycle mentioned above with a quintuple conjunction as Venus moves eastward, preceded by a singlet on August 6, 2047, as Venus moves westward. The average interval between corresponding conjunctions (for example the first of one set and the first of the next) is 1.599 years (583.9 days), based on the orbital speeds of Venus and Earth, but arbitrary conjunctions occur at least twice this often. The synodic cycle of Venus (1.599 years) is close to five times as long as that of Mercury (0.317 years). When they are in phase and move between the Sun and the Earth at the same time they remain close together in the sky for weeks.

The following table gives these average intervals, between corresponding conjunctions, in Julian years of 365.25 days, for combinations of the nine traditional planets. Conjunctions with the Sun are also included. Since Pluto is in resonance with Neptune the period used is 1.5 times that of Neptune, slightly different from the current value. The interval is then exactly thrice the period of Neptune.

==Notable conjunctions==

=== 1953 BC ===
On February 27, 1953, BC, Mercury, Venus, Mars and Saturn formed a group with an angular diameter of 26.45 arc minutes. Jupiter was on the same day only a few degrees away, so that on this day all 5 bright planets could be found in an area measuring only 4.33 degrees. David Pankenier and David Nivison have suggested that this conjunction occurred at the beginning of the Xia dynasty in China.

=== 929 ===
A triple conjunction between Mars and Jupiter occurred. At the first conjunction on May 26, 929, Mars, whose brightness was −1.8 mag, stood 3.1 degrees south of Jupiter with a brightness of −2.6 mag. The second conjunction took place on July 4, 929, whereby Mars stood 5.7 degrees south of Jupiter. Both planets were −2.8 mag bright. On August 18, 929, the −1.9 mag bright Mars stood 4.7 degrees south of Jupiter, which was −2.6 mag bright.

=== 1054 ===

On July 5th, 1054 a supernova brighter than Venus appeared in the eastern part of constellation Taurus in the proximity of the waning crescent moon. The exact geocentric conjunction in right ascension took place at 07:58 UTC on this day with an angular separation of 3 degrees. It was perhaps the brightest star-like object in recorded history. The event is possibly shown on two petroglyphs in Arizona.

=== 1503 ===
Between December 22, 1503, and December 27, 1503, all three bright outer planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn reached their opposition to sun and stood therefore close together at the nocturnal sky. During the opposition period 1503 Mars stood 3 times in conjunction with Jupiter (October 5, 1503, January 19, 1504, and February 8, 1504) and 3 times in conjunction with Saturn (October 14, 1503, December 26, 1503, and March 7, 1504). Jupiter and Saturn stood on May 24, 1504, in close conjunction with an angular separation of 19 arcminutes.

=== 1604 ===
On October 9, 1604, a conjunction between Mars and Jupiter took place, whereby Mars passed Jupiter 1.8 degrees southward. Only two degrees away from Jupiter Kepler&#x27;s Supernova appeared on the same day. This was perhaps the only time in recorded history a supernova took place near a conjunction of two planets.&lt;br&gt;
Saturn passed Kepler&#x27;s Supernova on December 12th, 1604 33 arc minutes southly, which was however unobservable as the elongation to the sun was just 3.1 degrees. On December 24, 1604 Mercury stood in conjunction with Kepler&#x27;s Supernova, whereby it was 1.8 degrees south of it. As the elongation of this event to the sun was 15 degree, it was in principle observable. On January 20th, 1605 Venus passed Kepler&#x27;s Supernova 29 arc minutes northwards at an elongation of 43.1 degrees to the sun.

===1899===
In early December 1899 the Sun and the naked-eye planets appeared to lie within a band 35 degrees wide along the ecliptic as seen from the Earth. As a consequence, over the period 1–4 December 1899, the Moon reached conjunction with, in order, Jupiter, Uranus, the Sun, Mercury, Mars, Saturn and Venus. Most of these conjunctions were not visible because of the glare of the Sun.

===1962===
Over the period 4–6 February 1962, in a rare series of events, Mercury and Venus reached conjunction as observed from the Earth, followed by Venus and Jupiter, then by Mars and Saturn. Conjunctions took place between the Moon and, in turn, Mars, Saturn, the Sun, Mercury, Venus and Jupiter. Mercury also reached inferior conjunction with the Sun. The conjunction between the Moon and the Sun at new Moon produced a total solar eclipse visible in Indonesia and the Pacific Ocean,
when these five naked-eye planets were visible in the vicinity of the Sun in the sky.

===1987===
Mercury, Venus and Mars separately reached conjunction with each other, and each separately with the Sun, within a 7-day period in August 1987 as seen from the Earth. The Moon also reached conjunction with each of these bodies on 24 August. However, none of these conjunctions were observable due to the glare of the Sun.

===2000===
In May 2000, in a very rare event, several planets lay in the vicinity of the Sun in the sky as seen from the Earth, and a series of conjunctions took place. Jupiter, Mercury and Saturn each reached conjunction with the Sun in the period 8–10 May. These three planets in turn were in conjunction with each other and with Venus over a period of a few weeks. However, most of these conjunctions were not visible from the Earth because of the glare from the Sun. NASA referred to May 5 as the date of the conjunction.

===2002===
Venus, Mars and Saturn appeared close together in the evening sky in early May 2002, with a conjunction of Mars and Saturn occurring on 4 May. This was followed by a conjunction of Venus and Saturn on 7 May, and another of Venus and Mars on 10 May when their angular separation was only 18 arcminutes. A series of conjunctions between the Moon and, in order, Saturn, Mars and Venus took place on 14 May, although it was not possible to observe all these in darkness from any single location on the Earth.

===2007===
A conjunction of the Moon and Mars took place on 24 December 2007, very close to the time of the full Moon and at the time when Mars was at opposition to the Sun. Mars and the full Moon appeared close together in the sky worldwide, with an occultation of Mars occurring for observers in some far northern locations.
A similar conjunction took place on 21 May 2016 and on 8 December 2022.

===2008===

A conjunction of Venus and Jupiter occurred on 1 December 2008, and several hours later both planets separately reached conjunction with the crescent Moon. An occultation of Venus by the Moon was visible from some locations. The three objects appeared close together in the sky from any location on the Earth.

===2012===

===2013===

At the end of May, Mercury, Venus and Jupiter went through a series of conjunctions only a few days apart.

===2015===
June 30 – Venus and Jupiter come close together in a planetary conjunction; they came approximately 1/3 a degree apart. The conjunction had been nicknamed the &quot;Star of Bethlehem.&quot;

===2016===

On the morning of January 9, Venus and Saturn came together in a conjunction

On August 27, Mercury and Venus were in conjunction, followed by a conjunction of Venus and Jupiter, meaning that the three planets were very close together in the evening sky.

===2017===

On the morning of November 13, Venus and Jupiter were in conjunction, meaning that they appeared close together in the morning sky.

===2018===
On the early hours of January 7, Mars and Jupiter were in conjunction. The pair was only 0.25 degrees apart in the sky at its closest.

===2020===

During most of February, March, and April, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn were close to each other, and so they underwent a series of conjunctions: on March 20, Mars was in conjunction with Jupiter, and on March 31, Mars was in conjunction with Saturn.
On December 21, Jupiter and Saturn appeared at their closest separation in the sky since 1623, in an event known as a great conjunction.

===2022===

Planetoid Pallas passed Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, on October 9 to the south at a distance of 8.5 arcminutes (source: Astrolutz 2022, ISBN 978-3-7534-7124-2). As Sirius is far south of the ecliptic only few objects of the solar system can be seen from earth close to Sirius.
At this occasion Pallas had not only the lowest angular distance to Sirius in the 21st century, but also since its discovery in 1802.
In the 19th century the greatest approach of Pallas and Sirius took place on October 11, 1879, when 8.6 mag bright Pallas passed Sirius 1.3° southwest and in the 20th century the lowest distance between Pallas and Sirius was reached on October 12, 1962, when Pallas, whose brightness was also 8.6 mag, stood 1.4° southwest of the brightest star in the sky.

<doc id="49435" wikidata="Q155127" url="?curid=49435" title="Axel Oxenstierna">
<text>Axel Gustafsson Oxenstierna (; 1583–1654) was a Swedish statesman and Count of Södermöre. He became a member of the Swedish Privy Council in 1609 and served as Lord High Chancellor of Sweden from 1612 until his death. He was a confidant of King Gustavus Adolphus and then Queen Christina, for whom he was at first regent. 

Oxenstierna is widely considered one of the most influential people in Swedish history. He played an important role during the Thirty Years&#x27; War and was appointed Governor-General of occupied Prussia; he is also credited for having laid the foundations of the modern central administrative structure of the State, including the creation of counties ().

==Early life and education==
Oxenstierna was born on 16 June 1583, at Fånö in Uppland, the son of Gustaf Gabrielsson Oxenstierna (1551–1597) and Barbro Axelsdotter Bielke (1556–1624), as the oldest of nine siblings. His parents belonged to the ancient and influential high noble families of Oxenstierna and Bielke, both of which had held high offices in the state and the church for generations. After the death of her husband Gustaf, Axel&#x27;s mother Barbro decided to let Axel and his brothers Christer and Gustaf finish their studies abroad. Thus, the brothers received their education at the universities of Rostock, Wittenberg and Jena. On returning home in 1603 he took up an appointment as valet de chambre &quot;(kammarjunkare)&quot; to King Charles IX of Sweden.

One of Oxenstierna&#x27;s more unusual intellectual qualifications was his knowledge of the Scots language, reflecting the importance of the Scottish expatriate community in Sweden at that time. As Chancellor, he would regularly receive correspondence in Scots from his agent Sir James Spens, and he ventured into the language himself for an official letter to his Scottish counterpart, the Earl of Loudoun.

==Career==

===1606–1611: Diplomat and Privy Councillor===
In 1606 he undertook his first diplomatic mission, to Mecklenburg and other German royal courts. While on diplomatic duty abroad, Oxenstierna gained appointment to the Privy Council (&quot;Riksrådet&quot;). Henceforth, Oxenstierna became one of the king&#x27;s most trusted servants. In 1609 he travelled to Reval (present day Tallinn), on King Charles&#x27;s behalf, to receive tributes from the city of Reval and the Estonian knighthood. Together with other councillors, Oxenstierna tried to warn the king of Denmark and the intentions of Danish King Christian IV. In 1610, Oxenstierna travelled to Copenhagen with the aim of preventing war with the neighbours, but unsuccessfully. The following year, Danish forces crossed the border, initiating the Kalmar War. In the fall of 1611, King Charles died. Around New Year 1611–12, the parliament had to deal with the situation. According to the rules, the 17-year-old Gustavus Adolphus had not reached the proper age to be considered adult enough to rule as king. However, the estates agreed to disregard those rules. In return, the young king agreed to ensure the nobles further privileges and appoint Axel Oxenstierna Lord High Chancellor of Sweden.
===1612–1629: Lord High Chancellor and Governor-General===
On 6 January 1612 Oxenstierna became Lord High Chancellor (&quot;Rikskansler&quot;) of the Privy Council. His controlling, organizing hand soon became apparent in every branch of the administration. Sweden was at the time troubled by three wars against Denmark (Kalmar War), Poland-Lithuania (Polish-Swedish War) and Russia (Ingrian War). Oxenstierna&#x27;s first big task as Chancellor was to achieve peace in some of the wars. The war against Denmark was considered the most dangerous of the three as the enemy-controlled parts of Sweden itself. Negotiations began in Knäred and Oxenstierna was first Swedish plenipotentiary. The negotiations led to the Treaty of Knäred in 1613. For his efforts regarding these negotiations, Oxenstierna received the title of district judge in the hundred of Snävringe and, eventually, the barony of Kimito.
During the frequent absences of Gustavus in Livonia and in Finland (1614–1616) Oxenstierna acted as his viceroy. One assignment Oxenstierna received while the king was in Livonia, was the task to finalize the negotiations regarding the marriage of John Casimir and the king&#x27;s sister, Princess Catharina. At the coronation of Gustavus Adolphus, in October 1617, Oxenstierna was knighted. In 1620 he headed the embassy dispatched to Berlin to arrange the nuptial contract between Gustavus and Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg. During the king&#x27;s Russian and Polish wars he had the principal duty of supplying the armies and the fleets with everything necessary, including men and money. Oxenstierna&#x27;s ways of carrying out his assignments apparently gained King Gustavus&#x27;s appreciation, since the king, in 1622, asked Oxenstierna to accompany him to Livonia and appointed him Governor-General and commandant of Riga, a strategically important town during the ongoing war against Poland. His services in Livonia gained him the reward of four castles (among others Burtnieki and Valmiera) and the whole bishopric of Wenden. Entrusted with the peace negotiations which led to the truce with Poland in 1623, he succeeded in averting a threatened rupture with Denmark in 1624. The Polish-Swedish War was reinitiated in 1626, and on 7 October that year, Oxenstierna became Governor-General in the newly acquired Swedish possession of Prussia. In 1629 he concluded the advantageous Truce of Altmark with Poland-Lithuania. Prior to this, in September 1628, he arranged a joint occupation of Stralsund with Denmark to prevent that important fortress from falling into the hands of the Imperialists.

Oxenstierna was not only highly successful within the diplomacy. During these years, he was entrusted with various important assignments in which he succeeded, such as gathering money and troops for the attack in Prussia in 1626. He played the leading organizational and administrational role in Prussia, as he had done earlier in Livonia. He was in charge of, for example, tolls, fortifications and the entire state grain trade. During the latter part of the 1620s, Elbląg (German: &quot;Elbing&quot;), where Oxenstierna resided and from where he governed the Swedish parts of Prussia, became a major Swedish centre of power, second only to Stockholm.

===1630–1636: Oxenstierna in the Thirty Years&#x27; War===
When Sweden entered the Thirty Years&#x27; War in the summer of 1630, tolls from Oxenstierna-controlled Prussia, as well as food supplies acquired by Oxenstierna, were pivotal assets. He had also obtained credits from foreign businessmen, ensuring large sums of money making it possible to hire mercenary soldiers to the army used in Germany.

After the Battle of Breitenfeld on 7 September 1631, Oxenstierna received a summons to assist the king with his counsels and co-operation in Germany. During the king&#x27;s absence in Franconia and Bavaria in 1632 he held the appointment of &quot;legatus&quot; in the Rhineland, with plenipotentiary authority over all the German generals and princes in the Swedish service. Although he never fought a battle, he frustrated all the efforts of the Spanish troops by using strategically successful regulations. He managed to conduct large reinforcements to King Gustavus through the heart of Germany in the summer of 1632.

In the Battle of Lützen (1632), on 6 November 1632, Gustavus Adolphus died. This meant that Oxenstierna became supreme commander of the Swedish troops in Germany, although he let his subordinate generals be responsible for the military operations on a lower level. He moved his headquarters to Mainz, which in practice became the new Swedish capital. Oxenstierna was now absolute ruler of the significant area that the Swedish army had conquered in Germany. He was offered the position as prince-elector of Mainz, but, after serious considerations, the offer was turned down.

When King Gustavus died in November 1632, his only legitimate and surviving child, Christina, was almost six years old. Until her declaration of majority at 18, a regency council ruled Sweden. This council was headed by Lord High Chancellor Oxenstierna, who wrote Instrument of Government (1634), a new constitution. During the years after the king&#x27;s death, it became apparent that differences of opinion existed within the council. Some of Oxenstierna&#x27;s colleagues recommended that Sweden should seek peace and withdraw from the war in Germany, not least after the defeat at Nördlingen in 1634. However, Oxenstierna&#x27;s opinion, that Sweden should remain in the war to ensure compensation for the sacrifices made, prevailed. The, for the Swedish side, disastrous outcome at Nördlingen brought him, for an instant, to the verge of ruin and compelled him for the first time so far to depart from his policy of independence as to solicit direct assistance from France. But, well aware that Richelieu needed the Swedish armies as much as he himself needed money, he refused at the Conference of Compiègne in 1635 to bind his hands in the future for the sake of some slight present relief. In 1636, nevertheless, he concluded a fresh subsidy-treaty with France at Wismar. Swedish troops remained in Germany all the way until 1648 and the Thirty Years&#x27; War&#x27;s end. Oxenstierna, however, left Germany and returned to Stockholm in 1636, after ten years duty as premier Swedish representative in Prussia and Germany.

===1636–1654: Back in Sweden===
Oxenstierna more directly claimed his place within the regency of Queen Christina and became the young queen&#x27;s teacher in statesmanship. His presence at home dominated all opposition, and such was the general confidence for Oxenstierna, that for the next nine years his voice, especially as regarding foreign affairs, remained omnipotent in the Privy Council.

====Torstenson War====
In May 1643, the Swedish Privy Council decided to attack Denmark. The Torstenson War was at large parts the work of Oxenstierna. The purpose was to gain territories from Denmark and be released from the Danish Sound Dues. Another factor might have been a will to avenge the tough peace Treaty of Knäred in 1613. Whatever the reason, Oxenstierna considered the time was right to finally settle the score with Denmark. Swedish troops led by Field Marshal Lennart Torstensson attacked Danish Jutland from Germany, while Field Marshal Gustav Horn was in charge of the troops that attacked Scania. 

In July 1644, Andries Bicker and Jacob de Witt were sent as envoy to Oxenstierna and the queen to mediate between Sweden and Denmark. Oxenstierna spoke High German, Christina Dutch. The outcome of the war was decided in the naval Battle of Fehmarn (1644) in October when the Royal Swedish Navy decisively defeated the Danish Navy. The defeat of the Danish Navy left the Danish isles open to a Swedish invasion, and Denmark sued for peace. The end of the war rested on the power of the Dutch naval dominance by Admiral Witte de With who arrived in the Sound in July to support the Dutch and Swedish point of view, a free passage. Oxenstierna was personally involved in the negotiations leading to the Treaty of Brömsebro at a creek in Blekinge. Sweden gained Gotland, Saaremaa (Ösel), Jämtland, Härjedalen and for thirty years Halland. Sweden had unrestricted access to the North Sea and was no longer encircled by Denmark–Norway. Shortly after the peace treaty, Oxenstierna was created Count of Södermöre.

====Queen Christina and her abdication====
When Christina came of age, she tried to push Oxenstierna, her old mentor, aside. The relations between the two were not good and Oxenstierna always attributed the exiguousness of Sweden&#x27;s gains under the Peace of Westphalia − Sweden gained only Western Pomerania, Usedom, Wollin, Wismar and Bremen-Verden − following the conference in Osnabrück to Christina&#x27;s undue interference. When the queen, a few years later, wanted to abdicate, Oxenstierna at first opposed this because he feared mischief to Sweden from the unruly and adventurous disposition of her preferred successor, Charles X Gustav. The chancellor changed his mind about Charles Gustav, however, and gave Christina the help she needed to go through with her abdication. Oxenstierna died two months after the ascension of the new king.

==Death==

Oxenstierna died in Stockholm on 28 August 1654. He was interred in Storkyrkan, Stockholm on 18 March 1655. His body was then moved to Jäder Church close to the Oxenstierna estate at Fiholm, in present-day Eskilstuna Municipality, where a vault had been built in accordance with his wishes. In the vault, &quot;Oxenstiernska gravvalvet&quot;, several members of the Oxenstierna family have been buried, including Axel and his spouse Anna.

==Personal life==

===Family===

On 5 June 1608 Axel Oxenstierna married Anna Åkesdotter Bååt, the daughter of nobleman Åke Johansson Bååt and Christina Trolle. The wedding took place at Fiholm Castle, owned by the Oxenstierna family. They had 13 children, of which five survived their childhoods:
#Gustaf (29 March 16091629), the oldest child, became a chamberlain.
#Johan (born and died 17 June 1610).
#Johan (24 June 16115 December 1657), named after his deceased brother, became a privy councillor.
#Christina (29 June 16128 August 1631), married Gustav Horn, Field Marshal and Lord High Constable.
#Catharina (29 June 161225 June 1661), twin with Christina, married Johan Jespersson Cruus.
#Beata (22 November 161315 January 1617).
#Barbro (12 February 161521 June 1617).
#Åke (March 16161617).
#Son (1617), either stillborn or died immediately after birth.
#Maria (born and died August 1618).
#Gabriel (born and died March 1620).
#Jakob (30 July 1621August 1621).
#Erik (13 January 162423 October 1656), served as a Lord High Chancellor after the death of his father Axel in 1654.

Axel Oxenstierna&#x27;s wife Anna died in 1649.

===Properties===
Oxenstierna was in possession of large estates and many mansions. During his life he owned palaces in, among others, Estonian Otepää, in Latvian Burtnieki, Ropaži and Valmiera, in Finnish Nousiainen (Nousis) and in Stockholm (Oxenstiernska Palace). The foremost of the mansions was Tidö Castle in Västmanland. In 1647, Wallonian merchant Louis De Geer, who had returned from a Swedish trading expedition to West Africa, gifted four enslaved Africans to Oxenstierna.

==Impact and legacy==

===The modernization of Sweden===
Axel Oxenstierna is perhaps most remembered for the establishment of a uniform administrative system. He was ever-present during the vast reforms of the 1610s and 1620s, when the Swedish government was hugely modernized and made more effective. This was necessary for the war policies that would build the Swedish Empire. Among the areas reformed were army and navy organization and recruiting, trade and industrial policies, regional and local administration, the system of higher education, and the judicial system. The boundaries of the administrative counties of Sweden still to a large extent follow the boundaries established by Oxenstierna in the 17th century.

===Relationship with King Gustavus Adolphus===
Oxenstierna would not have had such an impact unless he had won the king&#x27;s trust. From 1612, when Oxenstierna was appointed Lord High Chancellor, until 1632, when King Gustavus Adolphus died, the two men struck a long and successful partnership. They seem to have complemented each other. With Oxenstierna&#x27;s own words, his &quot;cool&quot; balanced the king&#x27;s &quot;heat&quot;. More than once, the chancellor had to realize plans of the king, plans that sometimes were highly spontaneous and far from ready to be implemented in reality. When it came to entering the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Oxenstierna was not as enthusiastic as the king, but since the king&#x27;s will was decisive, Oxenstierna accommodated himself to Gustavus&#x27;s wish. At times, Oxenstierna stepped in to ease tense relations that the harsh behaviour of the king had caused. He regularly received the highest praise for his work from the king and there was almost no area in which King Gustavus did not consult his Lord High Chancellor Oxenstierna.

===The mind behind the Instrument of Government of 1634===
The Chancellor made large contributions to the Standing orders of the House of Knights (&quot;riddarhusordning&quot;) of 1626. After the death of Gustavus Adolphus, Oxenstierna was the mind behind the Instrument of Government of 1634, in which, for example, the organization of the five Great Officers of the Realm was clarified. Five governmental branches, of which the Great Officers became heads, were established. Oxenstierna pushed through the Instrument of Government, but not without opposition. He claimed that the new form of government reflected the will of the late King Gustavus, making himself the interpreter of the king&#x27;s thoughts and wishes, and leaving the opposition no possibility to control the truth in this.

===Opinions===
Oxenstierna is regarded as a brilliant pragmatist, willing to reconsider his positions. There are examples of discussions within the Privy Council when Oxenstierna rejected laws he himself had earlier introduced, admitting that he knew better now. His way of examining, reconsidering, testing, and sometimes rejecting his earlier opinions constitutes his legacy more than his ideas on particular points of policy.

When he discovered that there were too few young noblemen to staff governmental positions, he worked to make it easier for boys outside the noble families to gain higher education, and gave them the possibility, eventually, to be raised to the nobility themselves. He could therefore be considered the father of Swedish meritocracy.

Oxenstierna was also a supporter of mercantilism and a believer in immigration and free enterprise.

In Germany, Oxenstierna became a fear-evoking character in a derived version of the popular German lullaby Schlaf, Kindlein, Schlaf!, in which he is referred to as &quot;Ochsenstern&quot;.

====Opinions about Oxenstierna====
Dutch jurist and philosopher Hugo Grotius considered Oxenstierna &quot;the greatest man of the century&quot;. French Cardinal Richelieu called him &quot;an inexhaustible source of fine advice&quot;, while Richelieu&#x27;s successor, Cardinal Mazarin, said that if all ministers of Europe were on the same ship, the helm would be handed to Oxenstierna. Pope Urban VIII claimed that Oxenstierna was one of the most excellent men the world had seen.

==Quotation==
Although attributed to Oxenstierna, the pope Julius III (1487-1555) is regarded to have been the first recorded author. Cardinal Richelieu has also been attributed to have been the author. This is probably the most famous Swedish quotation in the English-speaking world. The words were intended to encourage his son, a delegate to the negotiations that would lead to the Peace of Westphalia, who worried about his ability to hold his own amidst experienced and eminent statesmen and diplomats.

== Fictional portrayals ==

=== Film and TV ===
Oxenstierna has been portrayed on the stage and on the screen several times, mainly due to his role as mentor and guardian to the enigmatic Queen Christina. He was played by Lewis Stone in Rouben Mamoulian&#x27;s 1933 Hollywood movie &quot;Queen Christina&quot;, with Greta Garbo as the female lead role, by Cyril Cusack in Anthony Harvey&#x27;s &quot;The Abdication&quot; (1974) and by Michael Nyqvist in Mika Kaurismäki&#x27;s &quot;The Girl King&quot; (2015).

=== On stage ===
Samuel Ahlgren (1764–1816) played Oxenstierna in &quot;Drottning Kristina&quot; (1790), by the King Gustav III of Sweden who was an active playwright.

In August Strindberg&#x27;s 1901 play &quot;Kristina&quot;, Oxenstierna is portrayed as a cold realist criticising Christina&#x27;s extravagant lifestyle and her gifts to favourites.

The bass part of Oxenstierna was first performed by Giovanni Carlo Casanova in Jacopo Foroni&#x27;s 1849 opera &quot;Cristina, regina di Svezia&quot;.

=== Literature ===
Oxenstierna figures prominently in the &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; hypernovel by Eric Flint &quot;et al.&quot; until the fifth main sequence novel &quot;1636: The Saxon Uprising&quot; in which he attempts to organize a counter-revolution to restore the supremacy of the aristocrats while Gustav II Adolf is incapacitated, but Gustav Adolf recovers and in chapter 52 Oxenstierna is properly rewarded for his treason, along with three of his staff officers who started to draw their guns.

=== Games ===
The computer strategy game &quot;Europa Universalis IV&quot; has several in-game events related to Oxenstierna&#x27;s reforms and regency.

<text>Religious humanism or ethical humanism is an integration of humanist philosophy with congregational rites and community activity that center on human needs, interests, and abilities. Religious humanists set themselves apart from secular humanists by characterizing the nontheistic humanist life stance as a non-supernatural &quot;religion&quot; and structuring their organization around a congregational model.

Ethical Culture and religious humanist groups first formed in the United States from Unitarian ministers who, not believing in God, sought to build a secular religion influenced by the thinking of French philosopher Auguste Comte.

In the 21st century, religious humanists commonly unite under the umbrella of Ethical Culture or Ethical Humanism. This phenomenon is primarily centered in the United States. While a British Ethical movement was notably active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it had gradually distanced itself from its &quot;religious&quot; aspects by the 1960s. Instead, it emphasized humanism less as a religious identity and more as a practical label describing rational and non-religious perspectives on morality and ethics. 

==Origins==
In the late 20th century the Humanist movement came into conflict only with conservative Christian groups in the United States . &quot;Secular humanism&quot; has become the most popular form of organized Humanism. However, the American Humanist Association notes that it largely emerged from Ethical Culture, Unitarianism and Universalism.

===French Revolution===
The Cult of Reason () was an atheist philosophy devised during the French Revolution by Jacques Hébert, Pierre Gaspard Chaumette and their supporters.

In 1793 during the French Revolution, the cathedral Notre Dame de Paris was turned into a Temple to Reason and for a time Lady Liberty replaced the Virgin Mary on several altars.

===Positivism===
In the 1850s, Auguste Comte, the Father of Sociology, founded Positivism, a &quot;religion of humanity&quot;. Auguste Comte was a student and secretary for Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon, the Father of French Socialism. Auguste Comte coined the term &quot;altruism&quot;.

The BBC notes &quot;While atheism is merely the absence of belief, humanism is a positive attitude to the world, centered on human experience, thought, and hopes.&quot;

===Humanistic Religious Association===
One of the earliest forerunners of contemporary chartered humanist organizations was the Humanistic Religious Association formed in 1853 in London. This early group was democratically organized, with male and female members participating in the election of the leadership and promoted knowledge of the sciences, philosophy, and the arts.

===Ethical Culture===
The Ethical Culture movement was founded in 1876. The movement&#x27;s founder, Felix Adler, a former member of the Free Religious Association, conceived of Ethical Culture as a new religion that would strip away the accumulated unscientific dogmas of traditional religions while retaining and elevating the ethical message at the heart of all religions. Adler believed that traditional religions would ultimately prove to be incompatible with a scientific worldview. He felt that the vital aspects of religion should not be allowed to fall by the wayside. Religions provided vital functions in encouraging good works. And religions taught important truths about the world, albeit these truths were expressed through metaphors that were not always suited to modern understandings of the world. For example, monotheistic religions were based on a metaphor of an authoritarian monarchy, whereas democratic relationships were now understood to be the ideal.

Initially, Ethical Culture involved little in the way of ceremony and ritual. Rather, Ethical Culture was religious in the sense of playing a defining role in people&#x27;s lives and addressing issues of ultimate concern. Some Ethical Societies have subsequently added a degree of ritual as a means of marking special times or providing a tangible reminder of humanistic ideals.

===United States===

====19th century====
Before the term &quot;humanism&quot; was ever coined or even thought of being integrated into religion it had existed in America in at least an ideological sense for a very long time. Groups like the Free Religious Association (FRA) which was formed in 1867 and other less radical groups mainly consisting of extreme forms of early American Protestants such as the Unitarians and Quakers had existed from the first landings of the Europeans in the Western Hemisphere.

====20th century====

In 1915, a Positivist defined the term &quot;humanism&quot; in a magazine for the British Ethical Societies. Another Unitarian Minister John H. Dietrich read the magazine and adopted the term to describe his own religion. Dietrich is considered by some to be the &quot;Father of Religious Humanism&quot; (Olds 1996) particularly for his sermons while serving the First Unitarian Society of Minneapolis, which has since been considered the &quot;birthplace of Congregational Humanism&quot;. 

In 1929 Charles Francis Potter founded the First Humanist Society of New York whose advisory board included Julian Huxley, John Dewey, Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann. Potter was a minister from the Unitarian tradition and in 1930 he and his wife, Clara Cook Potter, published &quot;Humanism: A New Religion&quot;. Throughout the 1930s Potter was a well known advocate of women&#x27;s rights, access to birth control, &quot;civil divorce laws&quot;, and an end to capital punishment.

The first &quot;Humanist Manifesto&quot; was written in 1933 primarily by Raymond Bragg and was published with thirty-four signatories. Unlike its subsequent revisions, the first manifesto described a new &quot;religion&quot;, and referred to humanism as a religious movement meant to transcend and replace previous, deity-based religions. However, it is careful not to outline a creed or dogma. The document outlines a fifteen-point belief system, which, in addition to a secular outlook, opposes &quot;acquisitive and profit-motivated society&quot; and outlines a worldwide egalitarian society based on voluntary mutual cooperation. Bragg and eleven signatories were Unitarian ministers.

The Fellowship of Humanity was founded in 1935 by Reverend A. D. Faupel as one of a handful of &quot;humanist churches&quot; seeded in the early 20th century as part of the American Religious Humanism movement. It was the only such organization of that era to survive into the 21st century and is the first and oldest affiliate of the American Humanist Association.

In 1961 &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third New International Dictionary&quot; defined religious humanism as &quot;A modern American movement composed chiefly of non-theistic humanists and humanist churches and dedicated to achieving the ethical goals of religion without beliefs and rites resting upon superstition.&quot;

====Today====

Some of the US-based self-described Religious Humanist organizations currently active include:

* The Humanist Society (formerly the Humanist Society of Friends) (this organization has its roots in the Quaker tradition but today is not exclusively tied to that tradition)
* The Objector Church (founded in 2018 as an interfaith religious humanist community).

Many larger religious bodies include significant numbers of members and clergy who identify as being of humanist persuasion. These groups include

* Unitarian Universalists – As many as half or more members of UU congregations have historically identify themselves as humanists when surveyed. Humanist UU&#x27;s are represented by the UU Humanist Association (HUUmanists) (formerly the Friends of Religious Humanism)
* Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) – Groups within the Quaker communities that hold a humanist perspective include Nontheist Friends
* Judaism – see Humanistic Judaism, Reconstructionist Judaism
* Buddhist – see Humanistic Buddhism
Seeking to clarify that the word &quot;religious&quot; in Religious Humanism is not intended to imply a theistic or supernatural belief component, First Unitarian Society of Minneapolis, where Dietrich first used the term, has now rebranded the movement as &quot;Congregational Humanism&quot;. 

===United Kingdom===
The humanist movement first emerged in the UK as a religious &quot;ethical movement&quot; in the 19th century, with the South Place Religious Society in London being the largest &quot;ethical church&quot;. The remaining UK ethical societies merged in the 1890s to become the Union of Ethical Societies, which was founded and presided over by Stanton Coit. Ethical societies in the United Kingdom had their heyday in the late 19th century and early 20th century, with hundreds still attending weekly Sunday services at the West London Ethical Society (now part of Humanists UK) and South Place Ethical Society (now Conway Hall) in London in the 1950s. But they did not persist in this form for much longer than that. As time went on, Coit believed it would be advantageous for humanists to consciously organise in church-like structures, and even to think of themselves as congregations as they did in the US, in order to be more appealing to people from a Christian background. But there was a difference of opinion within the movement as to how explicitly to project or emphasise that Ethical Culture was atheistic. Following Coit&#x27;s tenure, much of his attempts to make humanism more &quot;congregational&quot; were swiftly reversed, and the trend went the other way. Both Conway Hall and the societies that made up the Ethical Union consciously moved away from the congregational model, becoming Conway Hall Ethical Society and the British Humanist Association (BHA) respectively. The BHA later became Humanists UK in the 2010s.

In 2013, the Sunday Assembly movement was founded in London as a &quot;godless congregation&quot; which was described in some places as &quot;church for atheists&quot;, filling the niche vacated by other humanist groups.

===Scandinavia===
In the Scandinavian countries, the popular Danish philosopher Harald Høffding&#x27;s positivist work &quot;Etik&quot; influenced the development of humanist societies, which in Sweden and Norway styled themselves as &quot;human-ethical associations&quot;, alike the Ethical Humanists in America and formerly in Britain. In modern times, the religious humanist/secular humanist distinction has fallen away; Norway, Human-Etisk Forbund is the name of Norway&#x27;s humanist association, but it is fully a part of the broader international humanist community, and uses both &quot;humanetikk&quot; and &quot;humanisme&quot; in describing its philosophy. In Sweden, the Human-Ethical Association rebranded as Humanisterna in 1999, dropping the congregational model as the British had done in the 1960s.

===Belgium===

Belgium is broadly divided between its Flemish Community (Flanders) and French-speaking community (Wallonia). In French Belgium, as in France, the secular movement is more concerned with national political organising and manifests nationally as the . In Flemish Belgium, the group &quot;deMens.nu&quot; (Humanity Now) brings together local humanist associations who engage in a broader range of activities, including community-based work. As with Humanists UK in the UK, &quot;deMens.nu&quot; grew from the union of local liberal or freethought associations.

==Discussion of terminology==
People writing about religious humanism are careful to distinguish religious humanism from Jewish humanism (nonreligious Jews who are humanists), Christian humanism (religious Christians asserting the humanitarian aspects of their religion), and secular humanism (often simply &quot;humanism&quot;, a non-religious approach to life), but confusion inevitably arises. Another such term is Secular Buddhism, which refers to an atheistic practice of Buddhist rituals.

Some experts on humanism, including Andrew Copson, argue that there have been deliberate attempts to &quot;muddy the conceptual water... of a complicatedly imprecise philosophical term&quot; by adding the slew of qualifying adjectives to humanism. He asserts that the term &quot;Christian humanism&quot; was first used in 1944, and argues that it has largely been used by Christians &quot;as a way of co‐opting the (to them) amenable aspects of humanism for their religion.

<text>Racial quotas in employment and education are numerical requirements or quotas for hiring, promoting, admitting and/or graduating members of a particular racial group. Racial quotas are often established as means of diminishing racial discrimination, addressing under-representation and evident racism against those racial groups or, the opposite, against the disadvantaged majority group (see &quot;numerus clausus&quot; or &quot;bhumiputra&quot; systems). Conversely, quotas have also been used historically to promote discrimination against minority groups by limiting access to influential institutions in employment and education.

These quotas may be determined by governmental authority and backed by governmental sanctions. When the total number of jobs or enrollment slots is fixed, this proportion may get translated to a specific number.

==Regions and nations==

=== Ancient Mongolia ===
The Mongols divided different races into a four-class system during the Yuan dynasty.

The Mongol Emperor Kublai Khan had introduced a hierarchy of reliability by dividing the population of the Yuan dynasty into the following classes:

*Mongols introduced it to China which was at time ruled by the Mongol Empire
*Semuren, immigrants from the west and some clans of Central Asia (Muslims, Christians, Jews, Buddhists)
*North Chinese, Kitans, Jurchens and Koreans
*Southerners, or all subjects of the former Song dynasty

=== Ancient China ===
Several laws enforcing racial segregation of foreigners were passed during the Tang dynasty. In 779 AD, the Tang dynasty issued an edict which forced Uighurs to wear their ethnic dress, and restricted them from marrying Chinese.

In 836 AD, Lu Chun was appointed as governor of Canton. He was disgusted to find Chinese living with foreigners and intermarriage. Lu enforced separation, banning interracial marriages, and prevented foreigners from owning properties.
The 836 law specifically banned Chinese from forming relationships with &quot;Dark peoples&quot; or &quot;People of colour&quot;, terms referring to foreigners, such as &quot;Iranians, Sogdians, Arabs, Indians, Malays, Sumatrans&quot;, etc.

=== France ===
By 1935, the French government enacted a series of racial quotas on certain professions.

=== Germany ===
See Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses.

=== Malaysia ===
See Bumiputera (Malaysia).

===United States===
The National Origins Formula was an American system of immigration quotas, between 1921 and 1965, which restricted immigration on the basis of existing proportions of the population. The goal was to maintain the existing ethnic composition of the United States. It had the effect of giving low quotas to Eastern and Southern Europe.

Such racial quotas were restored after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, especially during the 1970s. Richard Nixon&#x27;s Labor Secretary George P. Shultz demanded that anti-black construction unions allow a certain number of black people into the unions. The Department of Labor began enforcing these quotas across the country. After a U.S. Supreme Court case, &quot;Griggs v. Duke Power Company&quot;, found that neutral application tests and procedures that still resulted in &quot;de facto&quot; segregation of employees (if previous discrimination had existed) were illegal, more companies began implementing quotas on their own.

In a 1973 court case, a federal judge created one of the first mandated quotas when he ruled that half of the Bridgeport, Connecticut Police Department&#x27;s new employees must be either black or Puerto Rican. In 1974, the Department of Justice and the United Steelworkers of America came to an agreement on the largest-to-then quota program, for steel unions.

In 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Regents of the University of California v. Bakke&quot; that public universities (and other government institutions) could not set specific numerical targets based on race for admissions or employment. The Court said that &quot;goals&quot; and &quot;timetables&quot; for diversity could be set instead. A 1979 Supreme Court case, &quot;United Steelworkers v. Weber&quot;, found that private employers could set rigid numerical quotas, if they chose to do so. In 1980, the Supreme Court found that a 10% racial quota for federal contractors was permitted.

In 1990 City University of New York was accused of discriminatory hiring practices against Italian-Americans.

In 1991, President George H. W. Bush made an attempt to abolish affirmative action altogether, maintaining that &quot;any regulation, rule, enforcement practice or other aspect of these programs that mandates, encourages, or otherwise involves the use of quotas, preferences, set-asides or other devices on the basis of race, sex, religion or national origin are to be terminated as soon as is legally feasible&quot;. This claim led up to the creation of the Civil Rights Act of 1991; however, the document was not able to implement these changes. It only covered the terms for settling cases where discrimination has been confirmed to have occurred.

College admissions in the United States have had racial quotas; see for details. These have notably included blanket bans on African-Americans, Jewish quotas from 1918 to the 1950s, and an alleged Asian quota from the 1980s and ongoing .

=== South Africa ===
Local trade unions commonly use the term &quot;Absolute representation&quot; in this regard.
* BEE (Black Economic Empowerment) – Companies are scored based on the quota of black ownership, senior managers, training, as well as suppliers. These scores then translate into their ability to compete for government tenders.
* Affirmative Action – The SAPS (South African Police Service) operates a quota system policy for hiring and promotion. Positions will be left unfilled if the appropriate demographic candidate cannot be recruited, even if another qualified person is available.
* University Enrollment – First year students are registered on a racial quota basis. In some cases there are different admission requirements for different demographics. For example: to study medicine at the University of Cape Town (UCT), white and Indian students require at least a 78% average on their National Senior Certificate, whereas black students only requires 59%. This is largely as a result of the quota system requiring privileged access for certain ethnic groups – In 2016 the University of KwaZulu-Natal quota for medical students is 69% black African, 19% Indian, 9% coloured, 2% white and 1% other.
* Sport – Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula has imposed quota systems in athletics, cricket, football, netball and rugby.

==Opposition==
Opponents of quotas object that one group is favored at the expense of another whenever a quota is invoked rather than factors such as grade point averages or test scores. They argue that using quotas displaces individuals that would normally be favored based on their individual achievements. Opponents of racial quotas believe that qualifications should be the only determining factor when competing for a job or admission to a school. It is argued this causes &quot;reverse discrimination&quot; where individuals in the majority to lose out to a minority.

==Examples==
Some affirmative action programs openly involve quotas such as the admission program of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul. (See also: Vestibular exam#Racial quotas.)

The law student organization Building a Better Legal Profession developed a method to encourage politically liberal students to avoid law firms whose racial makeup is markedly different from that of the population as a whole. In an October 2007 press conference reported in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the group released data publicizing the numbers of African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asian-Americans at America&#x27;s top law firms. The group has sent information to top law schools around the country to encourage students who agree with its viewpoint to take the demographic data into account when they choose where to work after graduation. As more students choose where to work based on firms&#x27; diversity rankings, firms face an increasing market pressure to change theirs.

<doc id="49448" wikidata="Q84122" url="?curid=49448" title="Horus">
<text>Horus (), also known as Heru, Har, Her, or Hor () in Ancient Egyptian, is one of the most significant ancient Egyptian deities who served many functions, most notably as the god of kingship, healing, protection, the sun, and the sky. He was worshipped from at least the late prehistoric Egypt until the Ptolemaic Kingdom and Roman Egypt. Different forms of Horus are recorded in history, and these are treated as distinct gods by Egyptologists. These various forms may be different manifestations of the same multi-layered deity in which certain attributes or syncretic relationships are emphasized, not necessarily in opposition but complementary to one another, consistent with how the Ancient Egyptians viewed the multiple facets of reality. He was most often depicted as a falcon, most likely a lanner falcon or peregrine falcon, or as a man with a falcon head.

The earliest recorded form of Horus is the tutelary deity of Nekhen in Upper Egypt, who is the first known national god, specifically related to the ruling pharaoh who in time came to be regarded as a manifestation of Horus in life and Osiris in death. The most commonly encountered family relationship describes Horus as the son of Isis and Osiris, and he plays a key role in the Osiris myth as Osiris&#x27;s heir and the rival to Set, the murderer and brother of Osiris. In another tradition, Hathor is regarded as his mother and sometimes as his wife.

Claudius Aelianus wrote that Egyptians called the god Apollo &quot;Horus&quot; in their own language. However, Plutarch, elaborating further on the same tradition reported by the Greeks, specified that the one &quot;Horus&quot; whom the Egyptians equated with the Greek Apollo was in fact &quot;Horus the Elder&quot;, a primordial form of Horus whom Plutarch distinguishes from both Horus and Harpocrates.

==Etymology==
Horus is recorded in Egyptian hieroglyphs as &quot;ḥr.w&quot; &quot;Falcon&quot;, 𓅃; the original pronunciation has been reconstructed as in Old Egyptian and early Middle Egyptian, in later Middle Egyptian, and in Late Egyptian. Additional meanings are thought to have been &quot;the distant one&quot; or &quot;one who is above, over&quot;. As the language changed over time, it appeared in Coptic varieties variously as or (Ϩⲱⲣ) and was adopted into ancient Greek as &quot;Hō̂ros&quot; (pronounced at the time as ). It also survives in Late Egyptian and Coptic theophoric name forms such as Siese
&quot;son of Isis&quot; and Harsiese &quot;Horus, Son of Isis&quot;.

== Horus and the pharaoh ==

The pharaoh was associated with many specific deities. He was identified directly with Horus, who represented kingship itself and was seen as a protector of the pharaoh, and he was seen as the son of Ra, who ruled and regulated nature as the pharaoh ruled and regulated society.

The Pyramid Texts () describe the nature of the pharaoh in different characters as both Horus and Osiris. The pharaoh as Horus in life became the pharaoh as Osiris in death, where he was united with the other gods. New incarnations of Horus succeeded the deceased pharaoh on earth in the form of new pharaohs.The lineage of Horus, the eventual product of unions between the children of Atum, may have been a means to explain and justify pharaonic power. The gods produced by Atum were all representative of cosmic and terrestrial forces in Egyptian life. By identifying Horus as the offspring of these forces, then identifying him with Atum himself, and finally identifying the Pharaoh with Horus, the Pharaoh theologically had dominion over all the world.

== Origin mythology ==
In one tale, Horus is born to the goddess Isis after she retrieved all the dismembered body parts of her murdered husband Osiris, except his penis, which was thrown into the Nile and eaten by a catfish/Medjed, or sometimes depicted as instead by a crab, and according to Plutarch&#x27;s account used her magic powers to resurrect Osiris and fashion a phallus to conceive her son (older Egyptian accounts have the penis of Osiris surviving).

After becoming pregnant with Horus, Isis fled to the Nile Delta marshlands to hide from her brother Set, who jealously killed Osiris and who she knew would want to kill their son. There Isis bore a divine son, Horus. As birth, death and rebirth are recurrent themes in Egyptian lore and cosmology, it is not particularly strange that Horus also is the brother of Osiris and Isis, by Nut and Geb, together with Nephthys and Set. This elder Horus is called Hrw-wr - Hourou&#x27;Ur - as opposed to Hrw-P-Khrd - the child Horus, at some point adopted by the Greeks as Harpocrates.
=== Genealogy ===




== Mythological roles ==
=== Sky god ===
Since Horus was said to be the sky, he was considered to also contain the Sun and Moon. Egyptians believed that the Sun was his right eye and the Moon his left and that they traversed the sky when he, a falcon, flew across it. Later, the reason that the Moon was not as bright as the sun was explained by a tale, known as &quot;The Contendings of Horus and Seth&quot;. In this tale, it was said that Seth, the patron of Upper Egypt, and Horus, the patron of Lower Egypt, had battled for Egypt brutally, with neither side victorious, until eventually, the gods sided with Horus.

As Horus was the ultimate victor he became known as &quot;ḥr.w or&quot; &quot;Horus the Great&quot;, but more usually translated as &quot;Horus the Elder&quot;. In the struggle, Set had lost a testicle, and Horus&#x27; eye was gouged out.

Horus was occasionally shown in art as a naked boy with a finger in his mouth sitting on a lotus with his mother. In the form of a youth, Horus was referred to as &quot;nfr ḥr.w&quot; &quot;Good Horus&quot;, transliterated Neferhor, Nephoros or Nopheros (reconstructed as ).

The Eye of Horus is an ancient Egyptian symbol of protection and royal power from deities, in this case from Horus or Ra. The symbol is seen on images of Horus&#x27; mother, Isis, and on other deities associated with her. In the Egyptian language, the word for this symbol was &quot;wedjat&quot; (&quot;wɟt&quot;). It was the eye of one of the earliest Egyptian deities, Wadjet, who later became associated with Bastet, Mut, and Hathor as well. Wadjet was a solar deity and this symbol began as her all-seeing eye. In early artwork, Hathor is also depicted with this eye. Funerary amulets were often made in the shape of the Eye of Horus. The Wedjat or Eye of Horus is &quot;the central element&quot; of seven &quot;gold, faience, carnelian and lapis lazuli&quot; bracelets found on the mummy of Shoshenq II. The Wedjat &quot;was intended to protect the king [here] in the afterlife&quot; and to ward off evil. Egyptian and Near Eastern sailors would frequently paint the symbol on the bow of their vessel to ensure safe sea travel.

Horus was also thought to protect the sky.

=== Conflict between Horus and Set ===

Horus was told by his mother, Isis, to protect the people of Egypt from Set, the god of the desert, who had killed Horus&#x27; father, Osiris. Horus had many battles with Set, not only to avenge his father but to choose the rightful ruler of Egypt. In these battles, Horus came to be associated with Lower Egypt and became its patron.

According to &quot;The Contendings of Horus and Seth&quot;, Set is depicted as trying to prove his dominance by seducing Horus and then having sexual intercourse with him. However, Horus places his hand between his thighs and catches Set&#x27;s semen, then subsequently throws it in the river so that he may not be said to have been inseminated by Set. Horus (or Isis herself in some versions) then deliberately spreads his semen on some lettuce, which was Set&#x27;s favourite food. After Set had eaten the lettuce, they went to the gods to try to settle the argument over the rule of Egypt. The gods first listened to Set&#x27;s claim of dominance over Horus, and call his semen forth, but it answered from the river, invalidating his claim. Then, the gods listened to Horus&#x27; claim of having dominated Set, and call his semen forth, and it answered from inside Set.

However, Set still refused to relent, and the other gods were getting tired from over eighty years of fighting and challenges. Horus and Set challenged each other to a boat race, where they each raced in a boat made of stone. Horus and Set agreed, and the race started. But Horus had an edge: his boat was made of wood painted to resemble stone, rather than true stone. Set&#x27;s boat, being made of heavy stone, sank, but Horus&#x27; did not. Horus then won the race, and Set stepped down and officially gave Horus the throne of Egypt. Upon becoming king after Set&#x27;s defeat, Horus gives offerings to his deceased father Osiris, thus reviving and sustaining him in the afterlife. After the New Kingdom, Set was still considered the lord of the desert and its oases.
In many versions of the story, Horus and Set divide the realm between them. This division can be equated with any of several fundamental dualities that the Egyptians saw in their world. Horus may receive the fertile lands around the Nile, the core of Egyptian civilization, in which case Set takes the barren desert or the foreign lands that are associated with it; Horus may rule the earth while Set dwells in the sky; and each god may take one of the two traditional halves of the country, Upper and Lower Egypt, in which case either god may be connected with either region. Yet in the Memphite Theology, Geb, as judge, first apportions the realm between the claimants and then reverses himself, awarding sole control to Horus. In this peaceable union, Horus and Set are reconciled, and the dualities that they represent have been resolved into a united whole. Through this resolution, the order is restored after the tumultuous conflict.Egyptologists have often tried to connect the conflict between the two gods with political events early in Egypt&#x27;s history or prehistory. The cases in which the combatants divide the kingdom, and the frequent association of the paired Horus and Set with the union of Upper and Lower Egypt, suggest that the two deities represent some kind of division within the country. Egyptian tradition and archaeological evidence indicate that Egypt was united at the beginning of its history when an Upper Egyptian kingdom, in the south, conquered Lower Egypt in the north. The Upper Egyptian rulers called themselves &quot;followers of Horus&quot;, and Horus became the tutelary deity of the unified polity and its kings. Yet Horus and Set cannot be easily equated with the two halves of the country. Both deities had several cult centers in each region, and Horus is often associated with Lower Egypt and Set with Upper Egypt. Other events may have also affected the myth. Before even Upper Egypt had a single ruler, two of its major cities were Nekhen, in the far south, and Nagada, many miles to the north. The rulers of Nekhen, where Horus was the patron deity, are generally believed to have unified Upper Egypt, including Nagada, under their sway. Set was associated with Nagada, so it is possible that the divine conflict dimly reflects an enmity between the cities in the distant past. Much later, at the end of the Second Dynasty (), Pharaoh Seth-Peribsen used the Set animal to write his serekh name in place of the falcon hieroglyph representing Horus. His successor Khasekhemwy used both Horus and Set in the writing of his serekh. This evidence has prompted conjecture that the Second Dynasty saw a clash between the followers of the Horus king and the worshippers of Set led by Seth-Peribsen. Khasekhemwy&#x27;s use of the two animal symbols would then represent the reconciliation of the two factions, as does the resolution of the myth.

=== Golden Horus Osiris ===
Horus gradually took on the nature as both the son of Osiris and Osiris himself. He was referred to as Golden Horus Osiris. In the temple of Denderah he is given the full royal titulary of both that of Horus and Osiris. He was sometimes believed to be both the father of himself as well as his own son, and some later accounts have Osiris being brought back to life by Isis.

== Forms of Horus ==
=== Heru-ur (Horus the Elder) ===

Heru-ur, also known as Heru-wer, Haroeris, Horus the Great, and Horus the Elder, was the mature representation of the god Horus. This manifestation of Horus was especially worshipped at Letopolis in Lower Egypt. The Greeks identified him with the Greek god Apollo.

His titles include: &#x27;foremost of the two eyes&#x27;, &#x27;great god&#x27;, &#x27;lord of Ombos&#x27;, &#x27;possessor of the ijt-knife, who resides in Letopolis&#x27;, &#x27;Shu, son of Ra&#x27;, &#x27;Horus, strong of arm&#x27;, &#x27;great of power&#x27; and &#x27;lord of the slaughter in the entire land&#x27;. &#x27;Foremost of the two eyes&#x27; was a common epithet which was referring to the two eyes of the sky god. The two eyes represent the sun and the moon, as well as the Wadjet-eye, and played an important role in the cult of Heru-ur. His cult center was originally Letopolis; later he was also worshipped in Kom Ombo and Qus. In Kom Ombo, he was worshipped as the son of Ra and Heqet ,the husband of his sister-wife Tasenetnofret and father of the child god Panebtawy. 

In his Moralia, the Greek philosopher Plutarch mentions three additional parentage traditions that supposedly existed for Heru-ur during the Ptolemaic period. According to Plutarch&#x27;s account, Heru-ur was believed to be the son of Geb and Nut, born on the second of the five intercalary days at the end of the year, after Osiris and before Set, Isis, and Nephthys. Plutarch also records a variant tradition that assigns different fathers to Nut&#x27;s children: Osiris and Heru-ur are attributed to Nut and Ra, Isis to Nut and Thoth, while Nephthys and Set are said to be the children of Nut and Geb. Additionally, similar to other manifestations of Horus, Heru-ur is sometimes regarded as the child of Isis and Osiris, conceived by the pair while still within the womb of Nut.

Plutarch aims to distinguish between the child form of Horus, the son of Osiris and Isis, and &#x27;Haroëris&#x27; whom he refers to as &#x27;the elder Horus&#x27;. Haroëris is the hellenized version of the Egyptian epithet &#x27;Horus-wer&#x27;, which directly translates to &#x27;Horus the Great,&#x27; a term first appearing in Papyrus Spell 588, likely to differentiate Horus of the royal cult from lesser forms of Horus. However, ancient Egyptian texts do not maintain a distinction between a Horus the Elder and a &#x27;younger&#x27; Horus. Horus-wer is also sometimes referred to as the son of Osiris and Isis, and &#x27;wer&#x27; is a common epithet for ancient Egyptian gods and does not imply a separation between older and younger deities into two different generations.

Heru-ur was sometimes depicted fully as a falcon; he was sometimes given the title Kemwer, meaning &quot;(the) great black (one)&quot;.. Heru-ur was also depicted as a Hieracosphinx (a falcon headed lion). 

Other variants include &quot;Hor Merti&quot; &#x27;Horus of the two eyes&#x27; and &quot;Horkhenti Irti&quot;.

=== Heru-pa-khered (Horus the child) ===

Heru-pa-khered (Harpocrates to the Ptolemaic Greeks), also known as Horus the child, is represented in the form of a youth wearing a lock of hair (a sign of youth) on the right of his head while sucking his finger. In addition, he usually wears the united crowns of Egypt, the crown of Upper Egypt and the crown of Lower Egypt. He is a form of the rising sun, representing its earliest light.

As early as the third millennium BCE, Ancient Egyptian texts such as the Pyramid Texts referenced the birth, youth, and adulthood of the god Horus. However, his image as a child deity was not firmly established until the first millennium BCE, when Egyptian theologians began associating child gods with adult gods. From a historical perspective, Harpocrates is an artificial creation, originating from the priesthood of Thebes and later gaining popularity in the cults of other cities. His first known depiction dates to a stele from Mendes, erected during the reign of Sheshonq III (22nd Libyan Dynasty), commemorating a donation by the flutist Ânkhhorpakhered. Initially, Harpocrates originated as a duplicate of Khonsu-pa-khered, providing a child-god figure for the funerary gods Osiris and Isis. Unlike Horus, who was traditionally depicted as an adult, Khonsu, the lunar god, was inherently associated with youth. The cults of Harpocrates and Khonsu originally merged in a sanctuary within the Mut enclosure at Karnak. This sanctuary, later transformed into a mammisi (birth house) under the 21st Dynasty, celebrated the divine birth of the pharaoh, connecting the queen mother with the mother-goddesses Mut and Isis. The merging of local Theban beliefs with the Osiris cult endowed Harpocrates with dual ancestry, as seen in inscriptions at Wadi Hammamat which name him &#x27;Horus-the-child, son of Osiris and Isis, the Elder, the first-born of Amun.&#x27; The Osirian tradition solidified Harpocrates as the archetype of child-gods, firmly integrated into the Osirian family.

=== Heru-Behdeti (Horus of Behdet) ===
The winged sun of Horus of Edfu is a symbol in associated with divinity, royalty, and power in ancient Egypt. The winged sun is symbolic also of the eternal soul. When placed above the temple doors it served as a reminder to the people of their eternal nature. The winged sun was depicted on the top of pylons in the ancient temples throughout Egypt.

=== Har-em-akhet (Horus in the Horizon) ===
Har-em-akhet (or Horemakhet), (&quot;Harmakhis&quot; in Greek), represented the dawn and the early morning sun. He was often depicted as a sphinx with the head of a man (like the Great Sphinx of Giza), or as a hieracosphinx, a creature with a lion&#x27;s body and a falcon&#x27;s head and wings, sometimes with the head of a lion or ram (the latter providing a link to the god Khepri, the rising sun). It was believed that he was the inspiration for the Great Sphinx of Giza, constructed under the order of Khafre, whose head it depicts.

=== Harpara (Horus the sun) ===
Harpara (&quot;Horus the sun&quot;) is the child of Montu and Raet-Tawy, and formed with them the divine triad of North Karnak and Armant. In Medamud, Harpara was worshipped as the firstborn son of Amun and Raet-Tawy. while he is elsewhere described as the son of Mehet-Weret. A local form of Thoth named Thoth-of-Armant was most likely worshipped as the adult form of Harpra. In his capacity as the young manifestation of Thoth, Harpara was considered a lunar deity at Armant.

=== Other forms of Horus ===

*Hor Merti (&quot;Horus of the Two Eyes&quot;)
*Har-Nedj-Hef (&quot;Horus, the protector of his father&quot;) – A form of Horus who protected Osiris
*Horkhenti Irti
*Hor-imy-shenut – A form of Horus who had the body of a Crocodile
*Her-sema-tawy (&quot;Horus, Uniter of the Two Lands&quot;) – the Greek Harsomptus, depicted like the double-crowned Horus
*Her-iunmutef (&quot;Horus, Pillar of His Mother&quot;) – A form of Horus depicted as a priest with a leopard-skin over the torso.
*Herui (&quot;double falcon or Horuses&quot;) – the 5th nome of Upper Egypt god in Coptos.

== Celebrations of Horus ==
The Festival of Victory (Egyptian: Heb Nekhtet) was an annual Egyptian festival dedicated to the god Horus. The Festival of Victory was celebrated at the Temple of Horus at Edfu, and took place during the second month of the Season of the Emergence (or the sixth month of the Egyptian calendar).

The ceremonies which took place during the Festival of Victory included the performance of a sacred drama which commemorated the victory of Horus over Set. The main actor in this drama was the king of Egypt himself, who played the role of Horus. His adversary was a hippopotamus, who played the role of Set. In the course of the ritual, the king would strike the hippopotamus with a harpoon. The destruction of the hippopotamus by the king commemorated the defeat of Set by Horus, which also legitimised the king.

It is unlikely that the king attended the Festival of Victory every year; in many cases he was probably represented by a priest. It is also unlikely that a real hippopotamus was used in the festival every year; in many cases it was probably represented by a model.

The 4th-century Roman author Macrobius mentions another annual Egyptian festival dedicated to Horus in his &quot;Chronicon&quot;. Macrobius specifies this festival as occurring on the winter solstice. The 4th-century Christian bishop Epiphanius of Salamis also mentions a winter solstice festival of Horus in his &quot;Panarion&quot;. However, this festival is not attested in any native Egyptian sources.

==Suggested influence on Christianity ==
William R. Cooper&#x27;s 1877 book and Acharya S&#x27;s self-published 2008 book, among others, have suggested that there are many similarities between the story of Horus and the much later story of Jesus. This outlook remains very controversial and is disputed.

== In popular culture ==
Declan Hannigan portrays Horus in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) television series &quot;Moon Knight&quot; (2022).

In the film series &quot;Night at the Museum&quot;, a group of underworld warrior deities appear in &quot;Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian&quot; when Kahmunrah uses the combination to open the gate to the underworld and summon an army of Horus warriors. The warriors appear from the underworld carrying spears ready to attack and join Kahmunrah&#x27;s fight to take over the world.

Horus is a Warrior class God in the multiplayer online battle arena game &quot;Smite&quot; with the title of &quot;The Rightful Heir&quot;.

In the book trilogy &quot;The Kane Chronicles&quot; by Rick Riordan, main character Carter Kane hosts the spirit of Horus when he is released in the British Museum along with four other Egyptian deities. Horus speaks to Carter throughout the trilogy, offering him his advice and wisdom.

In the fantasy action film &quot;Gods of Egypt&quot; Horus is portrayed by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. In the film, he helps out a mortal named Bek to stop his uncle Set while also trying to reclaim his throne and bring peace to Egypt.

Horus appears in a 1980 science fiction graphic novel &quot;La Foire aux immortels&quot; written and illustrated by French cartoonist and storyteller Enki Bilal.

<text>The Bayeux Tapestry is an embroidered cloth nearly long and tall that depicts the events leading up to the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, led by William, Duke of Normandy challenging Harold II, King of England, and culminating in the Battle of Hastings. It is thought to date to the 11th century, within a few years of the battle. Now widely accepted to have been made in England, perhaps as a gift for William, it tells the story from the point of view of the conquering Normans and for centuries has been preserved in Normandy.

According to Sylvette Lemagnen, conservator of the tapestry, in her 2005 book &quot;La Tapisserie de Bayeux&quot;:

The cloth consists of 58 scenes, many with Latin &quot;tituli&quot;, embroidered on linen with coloured woollen yarns. It is likely that it was commissioned by Bishop Odo of Bayeux, William&#x27;s maternal half-brother, and made for him in England in the 1070s. In 1729, the hanging was rediscovered by scholars at a time when it was being displayed annually in Bayeux Cathedral. The tapestry is now exhibited at the Musée de la Tapisserie de Bayeux in Bayeux, Normandy, France 

The designs on the Bayeux Tapestry are embroidered rather than in a tapestry weave, so it does not meet narrower definitions of a tapestry. Nevertheless, it has always been referred to as a tapestry until recent years when the name &quot;Bayeux Embroidery&quot; has gained ground among certain art historians. It can be seen as a rare example of secular Romanesque art. Tapestries adorned both churches and wealthy houses in Medieval Western Europe, though at , the Bayeux Tapestry is exceptionally large. The background is not embroidered, providing a large, clear field of cloth which allows the figures and decorative elements to stand out very clearly.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The earliest known written reference to the tapestry is a 1476 inventory of Bayeux Cathedral, but its origins have been the subject of much speculation and controversy.

French legend maintained the tapestry was commissioned and created by Queen Matilda, William the Conqueror&#x27;s wife, and her ladies-in-waiting. Indeed, in France, it is occasionally known as (&quot;The Tapestry of Queen Matilda&quot;). However, scholarly analysis in the 20th century concluded it was probably commissioned by William&#x27;s half-brother, Bishop Odo of Bayeux, who, after the Conquest, also became Earl of Kent and, when William was absent in Normandy, regent of England.

The reasons for the Odo commission theory include:
#three of the bishop&#x27;s followers mentioned in the Domesday Book appear on the tapestry;
#it was found in Bayeux Cathedral, built by Odo; 
#it may have been commissioned at the same time as the cathedral&#x27;s construction in the 1070s, possibly completed by 1077 in time for display on the cathedral&#x27;s dedication.

Assuming Odo commissioned the tapestry, it was probably designed and constructed in England by Anglo-Saxon artists (Odo&#x27;s main power base being by then in Kent); the Latin text contains hints of Anglo-Saxon; other embroideries originate from England at this time; and the vegetable dyes can be found in cloth traditionally woven there. Howard B. Clarke has proposed that the designer of the tapestry (i.e., the individual responsible for its overall narrative and political argument) was Scolland, the abbot of St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey in Canterbury, because of his previous position as head of the scriptorium at Mont Saint-Michel (famed for its illumination), his travels to Trajan&#x27;s Column, and his connections to Wadard and Vital, two individuals identified in the tapestry. Alternatively, Christine Grainge has argued that the designer may have been Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury 1070–1089. The actual physical work of stitching was most probably undertaken by women needleworkers. Anglo-Saxon needlework of the more detailed type known as Opus Anglicanum was famous across Europe. It was perhaps commissioned for display in the hall of Odo&#x27;s palace in Bayeux, and then bequeathed to the cathedral he had built, following the precedent of the documented but lost hanging of the Anglo-Saxon warrior Byrhtnoth, bequeathed by his widow to Ely Abbey.

Other theories exist. Carola Hicks has suggested the tapestry could possibly have been commissioned by Edith of Wessex, widow of Edward the Confessor and sister of Harold. Wolfgang Grape has challenged the consensus that the embroidery is Anglo-Saxon, distinguishing between Anglo-Saxon and other Northern European techniques; Medieval material authority Elizabeth Coatsworth contradicted this: &quot;The attempt to distinguish Anglo-Saxon from other Northern European embroideries before 1100 on the grounds of technique cannot be upheld on the basis of present knowledge.&quot; George Beech suggests the tapestry was executed at the Abbey of Saint-Florent de Saumur in the Loire Valley and says the detailed depiction of the Breton campaign argues for additional sources in France. Andrew Bridgeford has suggested that the tapestry was actually of English design and encoded with secret messages meant to undermine Norman rule.

=== Recorded history ===
The first reference to the tapestry is from 1476 when it was listed in an inventory of the treasures of Bayeux Cathedral. It survived the sack of Bayeux by the Huguenots in 1562; and the next certain reference is from 1724. Antoine Lancelot sent a report to the &quot;Académie Royale des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres&quot; concerning a sketch he had received about a work concerning William the Conqueror. He had no idea where or what the original was, although he suggested it could have been a tapestry. Despite further enquiries he discovered no more.

The Benedictine scholar Bernard de Montfaucon made more successful investigations and found that the sketch was of a small portion of a tapestry preserved at Bayeux Cathedral. In 1729 and 1730, he published drawings and a detailed description of the complete work in the first two volumes of his &quot;Les Monuments de la Monarchie française&quot;. The drawings were by Antoine Benoît, one of the ablest draughtsmen of that time.

The tapestry was first briefly noted in English in 1746 by William Stukeley, in his &quot;Palaeographia Britannica&quot;. The first detailed account in English was written by Smart Lethieullier, who was living in Paris in 1732–3, and was acquainted with Lancelot and de Montfaucon: it was not published, however, until 1767, as an appendix to Andrew Ducarel&#x27;s &quot;Anglo-Norman Antiquities&quot;.

During the French Revolution, in 1792, the tapestry was confiscated as public property to be used for covering military wagons. It was rescued from a wagon by a local lawyer who stored it in his house until the troubles were over, whereupon he sent it to the city administrators for safekeeping. After the Reign of Terror, the Fine Arts Commission, set up to safeguard national treasures in 1803, required it to be removed to Paris for display at the Musée Napoléon. When Napoleon abandoned his planned invasion of Britain the tapestry&#x27;s propaganda value was lost and it was returned to Bayeux where the council displayed it on a winding apparatus of two cylinders. Despite scholars&#x27; concern that the tapestry was becoming damaged the council refused to return it to the cathedral.
In 1816, the Society of Antiquaries of London commissioned its historical draughtsman, Charles Stothard, to visit Bayeux to make an accurate hand-coloured facsimile of the tapestry. His drawings were subsequently engraved by James Basire jr. and published by the Society in 1819–23. Stothard&#x27;s images are still of value as a record of the tapestry as it was before 19th-century restoration.

By 1842, the tapestry was displayed in a special-purpose room in the Bibliothèque Publique. It required special storage in 1870, with the threatened invasion of Normandy in the Franco-Prussian War, and again in 1939–1944 by the Ahnenerbe during the German occupation of France and the Normandy landings. On 27 June 1944 the Gestapo took the tapestry to the Louvre, and on 18 August, three days before the Wehrmacht withdrew from Paris, Himmler sent a message (intercepted by Bletchley Park) ordering it to be taken to &quot;a place of safety&quot;, thought to be Berlin. It was only on 22 August that the SS attempted to take possession of the tapestry, by which time the Louvre was again in French hands. After the liberation of Paris, on 25 August, the tapestry was again put on public display in the Louvre, and in 1945 it was returned to Bayeux, where it is exhibited at the Musée de la Tapisserie de Bayeux.

=== Later reputation and history===
The inventory listing of 1476 shows that the tapestry was being hung annually in Bayeux Cathedral for the week of the Feast of St John the Baptist; this was still the case in 1728, although by that time the purpose was merely to air the hanging, which was otherwise stored in a chest. Clearly, the work was being well cared for. In the eighteenth century, the artistry was regarded as crude or even barbarous—red and yellow multi-coloured horses upset some critics. It was thought to be unfinished because the linen was not covered with embroidery. However, its exhibition in the Louvre in 1797 caused a sensation, with &quot;Le Moniteur&quot;, which normally dealt with foreign affairs, reporting on it on its first two pages. It inspired a popular musical, &quot;La Tapisserie de la Reine Mathilde&quot;. It was because the tapestry was regarded as an antiquity rather than a work of art that in 1804 it was returned to Bayeux, wherein 1823 one commentator, A. L. Léchaudé d&#x27;Anisy, reported that &quot;there is a sort of purity in its primitive forms, especially considering the state of the arts in the eleventh century&quot;.

The tapestry was becoming a tourist attraction, with Robert Southey complaining of the need to queue to see the work. In the 1843 &quot;Hand-book for Travellers in France&quot; by John Murray III, a visit was included on &quot;Recommended Route 26 (Caen to Cherbourg via Bayeux)&quot;, and this guidebook led John Ruskin to go there; he would describe the tapestry as &quot;the most interesting thing in its way conceivable&quot;. Charles Dickens, however, was not impressed: &quot;It is certainly the work of amateurs; very feeble amateurs at the beginning and very heedless some of them too.&quot;

During the Second World War Heinrich Himmler coveted the work, regarding it as &quot;important for our glorious and cultured Germanic history&quot;.

In 2018 French President Emmanuel Macron announced that the Bayeux Tapestry would be loaned to Britain for public display. It was expected to be exhibited at the British Museum in London in 2022, but strong objections were raised on conservation grounds. It would have been the first time in 950 years that the tapestry had left France, although evidence suggests that the tapestry was made in Canterbury. As of April 2024, however, a date for the loan had not yet been finalised.

== Construction, design and technique ==
In common with other embroidered hangings of the early medieval period, this piece is conventionally referred to as a &quot;tapestry&quot;, although it is not a &quot;true&quot; tapestry in which the design is woven into the cloth in tapestry weave; it is technically an embroidery, although it meets the traditional broader definition of &quot;tapestry&quot; as: &quot;A textile fabric decorated with designs of ornament or pictorial subjects, painted, embroidered, or woven in colours, used for wall hangings, curtains, covers for seats, ...&quot;

The Bayeux tapestry is embroidered in crewel (wool yarn) on a tabby-woven linen ground 68.38 metres long and 0.5 metres wide () and using two methods of stitching: outline or stem stitch for lettering and the outlines of figures, and couching or laid work for filling in figures. Nine linen panels, between fourteen and three metres in length, were sewn together after each was embroidered and the joins were disguised with subsequent embroidery. At the first join (start of scene 14) the borders do not line up properly but the technique was improved so that the later joins are practically invisible. The design involved a broad central zone with narrow decorative borders top and bottom. By inspecting the woollen threads behind the linen it is apparent all these aspects were embroidered together at a session and the awkward placing of the &quot;tituli&quot; is not due to them being added later. Later generations have patched the hanging in numerous places and some of the embroidery (especially in the final scene) has been reworked. The tapestry may well have maintained much of its original appearance—it now compares closely with a careful drawing made in 1730.

The end of the tapestry has been missing from time immemorial and the final &quot;titulus&quot; &quot;Et fuga verterunt Angli&quot; (&quot;and the English left fleeing&quot;) is said to be &quot;entirely spurious&quot;, added shortly before 1814 at a time of anti-English sentiment. Musset speculates the hanging was originally about 1.5 metres longer. In the last section still remaining, the embroidery has been almost completely restored, but this seems to have been done with at least some regard for the original stitching. The stylised tree is quite unlike any other tree in the tapestry. The start of the tapestry has also been restored but to a much lesser extent.

Norton has reviewed the various measurements of the length of the tapestry itself and of its nine individual linen panels. He has also attempted to estimate the size and architectural design of the 11th-century Bayeux Cathedral. He considers the tapestry would have fitted well if it had been hung along the south, west, and north arcades of the nave and that the scenes it depicts can be correlated with positions of the arcade bays in a way that would have been dramatically satisfying. He agrees with earlier speculation that a final panel is missing—one that shows William&#x27;s coronation and which he thinks was some three metres long. Norton concludes that the tapestry was definitely designed to be hung in Bayeux Cathedral specifically; that it was designed to appeal to a Norman audience; and that it was probably designed for Bishop Odo so as to be displayed at the dedication of the cathedral in 1077 in the presence of William, Matilda, their sons, and Odo.

The main yarn colours are terracotta or russet, blue-green, dull gold, olive green, and blue, with small amounts of dark blue or black and sage green. Later repairs are worked in light yellow, orange, and light greens. Laid yarns are couched in place with yarn of the same or contrasting colour.

The tapestry&#x27;s central zone contains most of the action, which sometimes overflows into the borders either for dramatic effect or because depictions would otherwise be very cramped (for example at Edward&#x27;s death scene). Events take place in a long series of scenes which are generally separated by highly stylised trees. However, the trees are not placed consistently and the greatest scene shift, between Harold&#x27;s audience with Edward after his return to England and Edward&#x27;s burial scene, is not marked in any way at all.

The &quot;tituli&quot; are normally in the central zone but occasionally use the top border. The borders are otherwise mostly purely decorative and only sometimes does the decoration complement the action in the central zone. The decoration consists of birds, beasts, fish and scenes from fables, agriculture, and hunting. There are frequent oblique bands separating the vignettes. There are nude figures, some of corpses from battle, others of a ribald nature. A harrow, a newly invented implement, is depicted (scene 10) and this is the earliest known depiction. The picture of Halley&#x27;s Comet, which appears in the upper border (scene 32), is the first known picture of this comet.

In 1724, a linen backing cloth was sewn on comparatively crudely and, in around the year 1800, large ink numerals were written on the backing which broadly enumerate each scene and which are still commonly used for reference.

== Background ==

=== Background of the events depicted ===
In a series of pictures supported by a written commentary, the tapestry tells the story of the events of 1064–1066 culminating in the Battle of Hastings. The two main protagonists are Harold Godwinson, recently crowned King of England, leading the Anglo-Saxon English, and William, Duke of Normandy, leading a mainly Norman army, sometimes called the companions of William the Conqueror.

William was the illegitimate son of Robert the Magnificent, Duke of Normandy, and Herleva (or Arlette), a tanner&#x27;s daughter. William became Duke of Normandy at the age of seven and was in control of Normandy by the age of nineteen. His half-brother was Bishop Odo of Bayeux.

King Edward the Confessor, king of England and about sixty years old at the time the tapestry starts its narration, had no children or any clear successor. Edward&#x27;s mother, Emma of Normandy, was William&#x27;s great aunt. At that time succession to the English throne was not by primogeniture but was decided jointly by the king and by an assembly of nobility, the Witenagemot.

Harold Godwinson, Earl of Wessex and the most powerful noble in England, was Edward&#x27;s brother-in-law. The Norman chronicler William of Poitiers reported that Edward had previously determined that William would succeed him on the throne, and Harold had sworn to honour this, and yet later that Harold had claimed Edward, on his deathbed, had made him heir over William. However, other sources, such as Eadmer dispute this claim.

=== Artistic context ===

Tapestry fragments have been found in Scandinavia dating from the ninth century and it is thought that Norman and Anglo-Saxon embroidery developed from this sort of work. Examples are to be found in the grave goods of the Oseberg ship and the Överhogdal tapestries.

A monastic text from Ely, the &quot;Liber Eliensis&quot;, mentions a woven narrative wall-hanging commemorating the deeds of Byrhtnoth, killed in 991. Wall-hangings were common by the tenth century with English and Norman texts particularly commending the skill of Anglo-Saxon seamstresses. Mural paintings imitating draperies still exist in France and Italy and there are twelfth-century mentions of other wall-hangings in Normandy and France. A poem by Baldric of Dol might even describe the Bayeux Tapestry itself. The Bayeux Tapestry was therefore not unique at the time it was created: rather it is remarkable for being the sole surviving example of medieval narrative needlework.

Very few hangings from the 11th century survive, but the Tapestry of Creation, or Girona Tapestry, is a large Romanesque panel of needlework, in the Museum of Girona Cathedral, Catalonia, Spain. The hanging depicts a series of figures from the Book of Genesis, and personifications of the month. The Cloth of Saint Gereon, in Germany, is the largest of a group of fragments from hangings based on decorative Byzantine silks, including animals, that are probably the earliest European survivals.

=== Events depicted ===

The tapestry begins with a panel of Edward the Confessor sending Harold to Normandy.(scene 1) Later Norman sources say that the mission was for Harold to pledge loyalty to William but the tapestry does not suggest any specific purpose. By mischance, Harold arrives at the wrong location in France and is taken prisoner by Guy, Count of Ponthieu.(scene 7) After exchanges of messages borne by mounted messengers, Harold is released to William, who then invites Harold to accompany him on a campaign against Conan II, Duke of Brittany. On the way, just outside the monastery of Mont Saint-Michel, the army becomes mired in quicksand and Harold saves two Norman soldiers.(scene 17) William&#x27;s army chases Conan from Dol de Bretagne to Rennes, and Conan finally surrenders at Dinan.(scene 20) William gives Harold arms and armour (possibly knighting him) and Harold takes an oath on saintly relics.(scene 23) Although the writing on the tapestry explicitly states an oath is taken there is no clue as to what is being promised.

Harold leaves for home and meets again with the old king Edward, who appears to be remonstrating with him.(scene 25) Harold is in a somewhat submissive posture and seems to be in disgrace. However, possibly deliberately, the king&#x27;s intentions are not made clear. The scene then shifts by about one year to when Edward has become mortally ill and the tapestry strongly suggests that, on his deathbed, he bequeaths the crown to Harold. What is probably the coronation ceremony is attended by Stigand, whose position as Archbishop of Canterbury was controversial.(scene 31) Stigand is performing a liturgical function, possibly not the crowning itself. The tapestry labels the celebrant as &quot;Stigant Archieps&quot; (Stigand the archbishop) although by that time he had been excommunicated by the papacy who considered his appointment unlawful.
A star with a streaming tail, now known to be Halley&#x27;s Comet, then appears. At this point, the lower border of the tapestry shows a fleet of ghost-like ships thus hinting at a future invasion.(scene 33) The news of Harold&#x27;s coronation is taken to Normandy, whereupon we are told that William is ordering a fleet of ships to be built although it is Bishop Odo shown issuing the instructions.(scene 35) The invaders reach England, and land unopposed. William orders his men to find food, and a meal is cooked.(scene 43) A house is burnt by two soldiers, which may indicate some ravaging of the local countryside on the part of the invaders, and underneath, on a smaller scale than the arsonists, a woman holds her boy&#x27;s hand as she asks for humanity.(scene 47) News is brought to William. The Normans build a motte and bailey at Hastings to defend their position. Messengers are sent between the two armies, and William makes a speech to prepare his army for battle.(scene 51)
The Battle of Hastings was fought on 14 October 1066 less than three weeks after the Battle of Stamford Bridge but the tapestry does not provide this context. The English fight on foot behind a shield wall, whilst the Normans are on horses. Two fallen knights are named as Leofwine and Gyrth, Harold&#x27;s brothers, but both armies are shown fighting bravely. Bishop Odo brandishes his baton or mace and rallies the Norman troops in battle.(scene 54) To reassure his knights that he is still alive and well, William raises his helmet to show his face. The battle becomes very bloody with troops being slaughtered and dismembered corpses littering the ground. King Harold is killed.(scene 57) This scene can be interpreted in different ways, as the name &quot;Harold&quot; appears above a number of knights, making it difficult to identify which character is Harold, since one character appears with an arrow shot in his head under the name &quot;Harold&quot; while another character is slain by a sword underneath the words &quot;was slain&quot; . The final remaining scene shows unarmoured English troops fleeing the battlefield. The last part of the tapestry is missing; however, it is thought that the story contained only one additional scene.

The text is in Latin but at times the style of words and spelling shows an English influence. A dark blue wool, almost black, is mostly used but towards the end of the tapestry other colours are used, sometimes for each word and other times for each letter. The complete text and English translation are displayed beside images of each scene at Bayeux Tapestry tituli.

== Unsettled questions ==


The depiction of events on the tapestry has raised several questions which remain unsettled.

The identification of Harold II of England in the vignette depicting his death is disputed. Some recent historians disagree with the traditional view that Harold is the figure struck in the eye with an arrow, and that the arrow is a later 18th/19th century modification following a period of repair. Benoît&#x27;s engraving of 1729, and Bernard de Montfaucon&#x27;s engravings of the tapestry as it was in 1730, show a spear or lance in place of the arrow and no arrow fletchings. Further, needle holes in the linen suggest that something has been removed, or shortened, and fletchings added to form an arrow. A figure is slain with a sword in the subsequent plate, and the phrase above the figure refers to Harold&#x27;s death (&quot;interfectus est&quot;, &quot;he is slain&quot;). 

This would appear to be more consistent with the labeling used elsewhere in the work. It was common medieval iconography that a perjurer was to die with a weapon through the eye. Therefore, the tapestry might be said to emphasize William&#x27;s rightful claim to the throne by depicting Harold as an oath breaker. Whether he actually died in this way remains a mystery and is much debated.

There is a panel with what appears to be a clergyman touching or possibly striking a woman&#x27;s face. No one knows the significance of this scene or the caption above it: &quot;ubi unus clericus et Ælfgyva&quot; (&quot;where [or &quot;in which&quot;] a certain cleric and Ælfgyva&quot;), where Ælfgyva is the Latinised spelling of Ælfgifu, a popular Anglo-Saxon woman&#x27;s name (literally &quot;elf-gift&quot;). The use of the grapheme Æ shows familiarity with English spelling. There are two naked male figures in the border below this figure; the one directly below the figure is in a pose mirroring that of the cleric, squatting and displaying his genitalia (a scene that was frequently censored in historical reproductions). However, similar naked figures appear elsewhere in the lower border where there seems to be no connection at all with the main action. 

Harold had a younger sister named Ælfgifu (her name is spelt Alveva in the Domesday Book of 1086) who was possibly promised to William by Harold or even betrothed to him, but she died c. 1066, prior to the invasion. Ælfgifu was also the name of the mother of Sweyn Knutsson and Harold Harefoot, past kings of Denmark and England respectively, via Cnut the Great. It has been speculated that this scene, occurring after the meeting of Harold and William, is to remind the contemporary viewers of a scandal that occurred between Ælfgifu of Northampton and Emma of Normandy, Cnut&#x27;s wives, that eventually led to the crowning of Edward the Confessor, child of Emma and her first husband, Æthelred the Unready.

At least two panels of the tapestry are missing, perhaps even another in total. This missing area may have depicted William&#x27;s coronation as King of England. A poem by Baldric of Dol describes a tapestry on the walls of the personal apartments of Adela of Normandy, which is very similar to the Bayeux depiction. He describes the closing scene as the coronation of William in London.

== Historical accuracy ==
The Bayeux Tapestry was probably commissioned by the House of Normandy and essentially depicts a Norman viewpoint. However, Harold is shown as brave, and his soldiers are not belittled. Throughout, William is described as &quot;dux&quot; (&quot;duke&quot;), whereas Harold, also called &quot;dux&quot; up to his coronation, is subsequently called &quot;rex&quot; (&quot;king&quot;). The fact that the narrative extensively covers Harold&#x27;s activities in Normandy (in 1064) indicates that the intention was to show a strong relationship between that expedition and the Norman Conquest starting two years later. It is for this reason that the tapestry is generally seen by modern scholars as an apologia for the Norman Conquest.
The tapestry&#x27;s narration seems to place stress on Harold&#x27;s oath to William, although its rationale is not made clear. Norman sources claim that the English succession was being pledged to William, but English sources give varied accounts. Today it is thought that the Norman sources are to be preferred. Both the tapestry and Norman sources name Stigand, the excommunicated archbishop of Canterbury, as the man who crowned Harold, possibly to discredit Harold&#x27;s kingship; one English source suggests that he was crowned by Ealdred, archbishop of York, and favoured by the papacy, making Harold&#x27;s position as legitimate king more secure. Contemporary scholarship has not decided the matter, although it is generally thought that Ealdred performed the coronation.

Although political propaganda or personal emphasis may have somewhat distorted the historical accuracy of the story, the Bayeux Tapestry constitutes a visual record of medieval arms, apparel, and other objects unlike any other artifact surviving from this period. There is no attempt at continuity between scenes, either in individuals&#x27; appearance or clothing. The knights carry shields, but show no system of hereditary coats of arms—the beginnings of modern heraldic structure were in place, but would not become standard until the middle of the 12th century. It has been noted that the warriors are depicted fighting with bare hands, while other sources indicate the general use of gloves in battle and hunt.

The American historian Stephen D. White, in a study of the tapestry, has &quot;cautioned against reading it as an English or Norman story, showing how the animal fables visible in the borders may instead offer a commentary on the dangers of conflict and the futility of pursuing power&quot;.

== Replicas and continuations ==

A number of replicas of the Bayeux Tapestry have been created, in various media.

*Through the collaboration of William Morris with textile manufacturer Thomas Wardle, Wardle&#x27;s wife Elizabeth, who was an accomplished seamstress, embarked on creating a reproduction in 1885. She organised some 37 women in her Leek School of Art Embroidery to collaborate working from a full-scale water-colour facsimile drawing provided by the South Kensington Museum. The full-size replica was finished in 1886 and is now exhibited in Reading Museum in Reading, Berkshire, England. The naked figure in the original tapestry (in the border below the Ælfgyva figure) is depicted wearing a brief garment because the drawing which was worked from was similarly bowdlerised. The replica was digitised and made available online in 2020. 
*Ray Dugan of University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, completed a stitched replica in 1996. Since its completion, it has been displayed in various museums and galleries in Canada and the United States.
*In 2000, a Danish association, Vikingegruppen Lindholm Høje, began making a replica of the Bayeux Tapestry using the original sewing techniques. The replica was completed in June 2014 and went on permanent exhibition at Børglum Abbey in May 2015.
*Dr. E. D. Wheeler, former judge and former dean at Oglethorpe University, commissioned a hand-painted, full-size replica of the Bayeux Tapestry completed by Margaret ReVille and donated it to the University of West Georgia in Carrollton in 1994. In 2014, the replica was acquired by the University of North Georgia in Dahlonega.

*An approximately half-scale mosaic version of the Bayeux Tapestry was formerly on display at Geraldine, New Zealand. It was made up of 1.5 million 7 mm2 pieces of spring steel—off-cuts from patterning disks of knitting machines—and was created by Michael Linton over a period of twenty years from 1979. The work was in 32 sections, and included a hypothetical reconstruction of the missing final section leading up to William the Conqueror&#x27;s coronation at Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day, 1066.
*Jason Welch, a woodcarver from North Creake, Norfolk, England, created a replica of the tapestry between 2011 and 2014 in carved and painted wooden relief on 25 five-foot planks. He undertook the project to help cope with the grief of losing his 18-year-old son.
*Mia Hansson, from Skanör, Sweden, living in Wisbech, Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire, started a reproduction on 13 July 2016. she had completed 40 metres, saying that she expected to finish in some 4 years. Hansson takes part of her replica out for talk and display events. In September 2020 she published &quot;Mia&#x27;s Bayeux Tapestry Colouring Book&quot;, with hand-drawn images from the tapestry.
*In January 2024, the Bayeux Museum acquired a Victorian replica of the Bayeux tapestry as part of the late Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts&#x27;s estate auction, purchased for £16,000. The replica, one of three known surviving Victorian copies, was originally created as a panoramic photograph in the 19th century.

Other modern artists have attempted to complete the work by creating panels depicting subsequent events up to William&#x27;s coronation, though the actual content of the missing panels is unknown. In 1997, the embroidery artist Jan Messent completed a reconstruction showing William accepting the surrender of English nobles at Berkhamsted (&quot;Beorcham&quot;), Hertfordshire, and his coronation. In early 2013, 416 residents of Alderney in the Channel Islands finished a continuation including William&#x27;s coronation and the building of the Tower of London.

== In popular culture ==

Because it resembles a modern comic strip or movie storyboard, is widely recognised, and is so distinctive in its artistic style, the Bayeux Tapestry has frequently been used or reimagined in a variety of different popular culture contexts. George Wingfield Digby wrote in 1957:
It has been cited by Scott McCloud in &quot;Understanding Comics&quot; as an example of early sequential-narrative art; and Bryan Talbot, a British comic book artist, has called it &quot;the first known British comic strip&quot;.

It has inspired many modern political and other cartoons, including:
* John Hassall&#x27;s satirical pastiche &quot;Ye Berlyn Tapestrie&quot;, published in 1915, which tells the story of the German invasion of Belgium in August 1914
* Rea Irvin&#x27;s cover for the &quot;New Yorker&quot; magazine of 15 July 1944 marking D-Day
* George Gale&#x27;s pastiche chronicling the saga leading up to Britain&#x27;s entry into the European Economic Community, published across six pages in &quot;The Times&quot; &quot;Europa&quot; supplement on 1 January 1973

The tapestry has inspired modern embroideries, most notably and directly:
* The Overlord Embroidery (1974), commemorating Operation Overlord and the Normandy landings of 1944, now at Portsmouth
* The Prestonpans Tapestry (2010), which chronicles the events surrounding the Battle of Prestonpans in 1745
* The Black Gold Tapestry (2017), by Sandra Sawatzky, depicting 5000 years of the history of oil

Other embroideries more loosely inspired by it include the Hastings Embroidery (1966), the New World Tapestry (1980–2000), the Quaker Tapestry (1981–89), the Great Tapestry of Scotland (2013), the Scottish Diaspora Tapestry (2014–15), &quot;Magna Carta (An Embroidery)&quot; (2014–15), and (in this case a woven tapestry with embroidered details) the Game of Thrones Tapestry (2017–19).

A number of films have used sections of the tapestry in their opening credits or closing titles, including Disney&#x27;s &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot;, Anthony Mann&#x27;s &quot;El Cid&quot;, Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Frank Cassenti&#x27;s &quot;La Chanson de Roland&quot;, Kevin Reynolds&#x27; &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;, and Richard Fleischer&#x27;s &quot;The Vikings&quot;.

The design and embroidery of the tapestry form one of the narrative strands of Marta Morazzoni&#x27;s 1988 novella &quot;The Invention of Truth&quot;.

The tapestry is referred to in Tony Kushner&#x27;s play &quot;Angels in America&quot;. The apocryphal account of Queen Matilda&#x27;s creation of the tapestry is used, perhaps in order to demonstrate that Louis, one of the main characters, holds himself to mythological standards.

In 2022 the French documentary &quot;Mysteries of the Bayeux Tapestry&quot; was broadcast by BBC Four. It was written by Jonas Rosales, directed by Alexis de Favitski and produced by Antoine Bamas. The documentary covered investigations carried out on the tapestry by the Laboratoire d&#x27;Archéologie Moléculaire et Structurale (LAMS) at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, which used a hyperspectral camera, measuring 215 different colours, to analyse the pigments which produced the original colours for the dyes, extracted from madder, weld and indigo.

At the behest of series showrunner Ryan Condal, the opening credits of the second season of the &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; prequel &quot;House of the Dragon&quot; (2024) were redesigned with an animated sequence in embroidery that was inspired by the Bayeux Tapestry.

<doc id="49453" wikidata="Q107626" url="?curid=49453" title="Seth">
<text>Seth, in the Abrahamic religions, was the third son of Adam and Eve. The Hebrew Bible names two of his siblings (although it also states that he had others): his brothers Cain and Abel. According to , Seth was born after Abel&#x27;s murder by Cain, and Eve believed that God had appointed him as a replacement for Abel.

==Genesis==
According to the Book of Genesis, Seth was born when Adam was 130 years old (according to the Masoretic Text), or 230 years old (according to the Septuagint), &quot;a son in his likeness and image&quot;. The genealogy repeated at . states that Adam fathered &quot;sons and daughters&quot; before his death, aged 930 years. According to Genesis, Seth died at the age of 912 (that is, 14 years before Noah&#x27;s birth).

==Jewish tradition==
Seth figures in the biblical texts of the &quot;Life of Adam and Eve&quot; (the &quot;Apocalypse of Moses&quot;). It recounts the lives of Adam and Eve from after their expulsion from the Garden of Eden to their deaths. While the surviving versions were composed from the early third to the fifth century, the literary units in the work are considered to be older and predominantly of Jewish origin. There is wide agreement that the original was composed in a Semitic language in the first century AD/CE. In the Greek versions, Seth and Eve travel to the doors of the Garden to beg for some oil of the Tree of Mercy (i.e. the Tree of Life). On the way, Seth is attacked and bitten by a wild beast, which goes away when ordered by Seth. Michael refuses to give them the oil at that time, but promises to give it at the end of time, when all flesh will be raised up, the delights of paradise will be given to the holy people and God will be in their midst. On their return, Adam says to Eve: &quot;What hast thou done? Thou hast brought upon us great wrath which is death.&quot; (chapters 5–14) Later, only Seth can witness the taking-up of Adam at his funeral in a divine chariot, which deposits him in the Garden of Eden.

Genesis refers to Seth as the ancestor of Noah and hence the father of all mankind, all other humans having perished in the Great Flood. It is said that late in life, Adam gave Seth secret teachings that would become the Kabbalah. The Zohar refers to Seth as &quot;ancestor of all the generations of the Egyptians or Tsetsaudim&quot; (Hebrew: righteous ones). According to Seder Olam Rabbah, based on Jewish reckoning, he was born in 2130 BC AM. According to Aggadah, he had 2 sons and many wives. According to the Seder Olam Rabbah, he died in 1042 AM.

==Josephus==
In the &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, Josephus refers to Seth as virtuous and of excellent character, and reports that his descendants invented the wisdom of the heavenly bodies, and built the &quot;pillars of the sons of Seth&quot;, two pillars inscribed with many scientific discoveries and inventions, notably in astronomy. They were built by Seth&#x27;s descendants based on Adam&#x27;s prediction that the world would be destroyed at one time by fire and another time by global flood, in order to protect the discoveries and be remembered after the destruction. One was composed of brick, and the other of stone, so that if the pillar of brick should be destroyed, the pillar of stone would remain, both reporting the ancient discoveries, and informing humankind that a pillar of brick was also erected. Josephus reports that the pillar of stone remained in the land of Siriad in his day.

William Whiston, a 17/18th-century translator of the &quot;Antiquities&quot;, stated in a footnote that he believed Josephus mistook Seth for Sesostris, king of Egypt, the erector of the pillar in Siriad (being a contemporary name for the territories in which Sirius was venerated, i.e. Egypt). He stated that there was no way for any pillars of Seth to survive the deluge, because the deluge buried all such pillars and edifices far underground in the sediment of its waters. The perennialist writer Nigel Jackson identifies the land of Siriad in Josephus&#x27; account with Syria, citing related Mandaean legends regarding the &quot;Oriental Land of Shyr&quot; in connection with the visionary mytho-geography of the prophetic traditions surrounding Seth.

==Christianity==
The second-century BC Book of Jubilees, regarded as noncanonical except in the Oriental Orthodox Churches, also dates his birth to 130 AM. According to it, in 231 AM Seth married his sister, Azura, who was four years younger than he was. In the year 235 AM, Azura gave birth to Enos.

Seth is commemorated as one of the Holy Forefathers in the Calendar of Saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church, along with Adam, Abel, and others, with a feast day on July 26. He is also included in the Genealogy of Jesus, according to Luke 3:23–38.

The Sethians were a Christian Gnostic sect who may date their existence to before Christianity. Their thinking, although predominantly Judaic in foundation, was arguably strongly influenced by Platonism. Sethians were named for their veneration of Seth, depicted in their creation myths as a divine incarnation; consequently, the offspring or &#x27;posterity&#x27; of Seth are held to comprise a superior elect within human society.

== Islam ==
The Quran makes no mention of Šīṯ ibn Ādam. He is respected within Islamic traditions as the third and righteous son of Adam and Eve and seen as the gift bestowed on Adam after the death of Abel. The Sunni scholar and historian ibn Kathir in his &quot;tarikh&quot; (book of history), &quot;Al-Bidāya wa-n-nihāya&quot; (), records that Seth, a prophet like his father Adam, transfers God&#x27;s Law to mankind after the death of Adam, and places him among the exalted antediluvian patriarchs of the Generations of Adam. Some sources say that Seth was the receiver of scriptures. These scriptures are said to be the &quot;first scriptures&quot; mentioned in the Quran 87:18. Medieval historian and exegete al-Tabari and other scholars say that Seth buried Adam and the secret texts in the tomb of Adam, i.e., the &quot;Cave of Treasures&quot;.

Islamic literature holds that Seth was born when Adam was past 100 and that Adam appointed Seth as guide to his people. The 11th-century Syrian historian and translator Al-Mubashshir ibn Fātik recorded the maxims and aphorisms of the ancient philosophers in his book &quot;Kitāb mukhtār al-ḥikam wa-maḥāsin al-kalim&quot; and included a chapter on Seth. Within Islamic tradition Seth holds wisdom of several kinds; knowledge of time, prophecy of the future Great Flood, and inspiration on the methods of night prayer. Islam, Judaism and Christianity trace the genealogy of mankind back to Seth since Abel left no heirs and Cain&#x27;s heirs, according to tradition, were destroyed by the Great Flood. Many traditional Islamic crafts are traced back to Seth, such as the making of horn combs. Seth also plays a role in Sufism, and Ibn Arabi includes a chapter in his &quot;Bezels of Wisdom&quot; on Seth, entitled &quot;The Wisdom of Expiration in the Word of Seth&quot;.

Some traditions locate Seth&#x27;s tomb in the village of Al-Nabi Shayth ( &quot;The Prophet Seth&quot;) in the mountains above the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon, where there is a mosque named after him. This tomb was described by the 12th-century geographer Ibn Jubayr. A rival tradition, mentioned by later medieval Arab geographers from the 13th century on, placed the tomb of &quot;Nabi Shith&quot; (&quot;Prophet Seth&quot;) in the Palestinian village of Bashshit, southwest of Ramla village. According to the Palestine Exploration Fund, Bashshit means &quot;Beit Shith&quot;, i.e. &quot;House of Seth&quot;. The village was depopulated with the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, but the three-domed structure said to be Seth&#x27;s tomb survives in the Israeli moshav Aseret built on the site. Another tomb in the city of Balkh, Afghanistan has been identified as the burial site of Seth sheth

Local Muslims in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh in India believe a grave in Hazrat Shees Jinnati Mosque to be the maqam of Hazrat Shees or the Prophet Seth. This belief is mentioned in a 16th-century Mughal document &quot;Ain-i-Akbari&quot; and is also mentioned in the work &quot;India of Aurangzeb&quot; of Jadunath Sarkar.

==Mandaeism==

According to the Mandaean scriptures, including the Qulasta, the Mandaean Book of John and Genzā Rabbā, Seth is cognate with the angelic soteriological figure Shitil (), a son of Adam Kadmaya who taught John the Baptist with his brothers Anush (Enosh) and Hibil (Abel). He is variously spoken of as a son of Adam, a brother or son of Hibil, and the brother or father of Anush. Shitil is one of the revealers of Mandaeism and a prophet, identified as the biblical Seth.

==Yazidism==

In Yazidism, Seth is known as Shehid ibn Jerr.

According to Yazidi oral literature, Adam and Eve each deposited their seeds into separate jars. While Eve&#x27;s seed developed into insects, Adam&#x27;s seed gave birth to Shehid ibn Jerr, the ancestor of the Yazidis. Yazidis thus believe that they have been created separately and differently from all other human beings (Kreyenbroek 2005: 31).

==Shrines==

===Iraq===
On July 26, 2014, forces of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) blew up Nabi Shiyt (Prophet Seth) shrine in Mosul, Iraq. Sami al-Massoudi, the deputy head of the Shiite Endowment Office overseeing holy sites, confirmed that destruction. He added, ISIL took some of the artifacts to an unknown location.

===Lebanon===
There is a village named after him in Lebanon, that is &quot;Al-Nabi Shayth&quot; or &quot;Al-Nabi Sheeth&quot; (meaning &quot;The Prophet Seth&quot;), which is also considered to contain his shrine.

===Israel===

The tomb of Bashshit is believed to be the grave of Seth. The tomb now sits in Aseret.

<text>Gateway Arch National Park is a national park of the United States located in St. Louis, Missouri, near the starting point of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

In its initial form as a national memorial, it was established in 1935 to commemorate:
*the Louisiana Purchase and subsequent westward movement of American explorers and pioneers;
*the first civil government west of the Mississippi River; and
*the debate over slavery raised by the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; case.

The national park consists of the Gateway Arch, a steel catenary arch that has become the definitive icon of St. Louis; a park along the Mississippi River on the site of the earliest buildings of the city; the Old Courthouse, a former state and federal courthouse where the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; case originated; and the museum at the Gateway Arch. It is the smallest national park in the United States at , less than 2% the size of the next-smallest, Hot Springs National Park.

The immediate surroundings of the Gateway Arch were initially designated the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial by secretarial order on December 21, 1935. The Gateway Arch was completed on October 28, 1965. The park is maintained by the National Park Service (NPS).

The area surrounding the arch was redesignated as the Gateway Arch National Park in 2018. This change has been controversial due to the nature of the site (national parks typically include conserved natural landscapes and significant opportunities for nature recreation, whereas sites that have primarily historical and architectural significance are usually given other NPS designations). Several publications noted that the addition of Gateway Arch as a national park eroded the significance associated with the &quot;national park&quot; designation, and some suggested that the change was made in order to promote tourism rather than to conserve a nature area.

==Components==
===The Gateway Arch===

The Gateway Arch, known as the &quot;Gateway to the West,&quot; is the tallest structure in Missouri. It was designed by the Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen and the German-American structural engineer Hannskarl Bandel in 1947 and built between 1963 and October 1965. It stands tall and wide at its base. The legs are wide at the base, narrowing to at the arch. There is a unique tram system to carry passengers to the observation room at the top of the arch.

===Old Courthouse===

The Old Courthouse is built on land originally deeded by St. Louis founder Auguste Chouteau. It marks the location over which the arch reaches. Its dome was built during the American Civil War and is similar to the dome on the United States Capitol which was also built during the Civil War. It was the site of the local trials in the Dred Scott case.

The courthouse is the only portion of the memorial west of Interstate 44. To the west of the Old Courthouse is the Gateway Mall between Market and Chestnut Streets which is only interrupted by the Civil Courts Building which features a pyramid model of the Mausoleum of Mausolus (which was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World) on its roof. When the Civil Courts building was built in the 1920s, the Chouteau family sued to regain the property belonging to the Old Courthouse because it had been deeded in perpetuity to be a courthouse.

===Museum at the Gateway Arch===
Underneath the arch is a visitor center, entered from a circular entryway facing the Old Courthouse. Within the center, a project to rebuild the Museum at the Gateway Arch was completed in July 2018. The new museum features exhibits on a variety of topics including westward expansion and the construction of the Arch, all told through a St. Louis lens. Tucker Theater, finished in 1968 and renovated 30 years later, has about 285 seats and shows a documentary (&quot;Monument to the Dream&quot;) on the arch&#x27;s construction. A second theater was added in 1993 but removed in 2018 as part of the CityArchRiver renovation project. Also located in the visitor center are a gift shop and cafe.

==History==
===1930s===

The memorial was developed largely through the efforts of St. Louis civic booster Luther Ely Smith who first pitched the idea in 1933, was the long-term chairman of the committee that selected the area and persuaded Franklin Roosevelt in 1935 to make it a National Park Service unit after St. Louis passed a bond issue to begin building it and who partially financed the 1947 architectural contest that selected the arch.

In the early 1930s the United States began looking for a suitable memorial for Thomas Jefferson (the Washington Monument and the newly built Lincoln Memorial were the only large Presidential memorials at the time).

Shortly after Thanksgiving in 1933 Smith who had been on the commission to build the George Rogers Clark National Historical Park in Indiana, was returning via train when he noticed the poor condition of the original platted location of St. Louis along the Mississippi. He thought that the memorial to Jefferson should be on the actual location that was symbolic of one of Jefferson&#x27;s greatest triumphs—the Louisiana Purchase.

The originally platted area of St. Louis was the site of:
*The Battle of St. Louis, the only battle west of the Mississippi River in the American Revolutionary War.
*The first capital of Upper Louisiana for the United States, the Louisiana Purchase north of the 33rd parallel that was the original Louisiana Territory in 1803.
*The Three Flags Day ceremony in 1804 in which Spain formally turned over Louisiana to France, less than 24 hours before France then officially turned it over to the United States. This technically completed the Louisiana Purchase, and also cleared the way for Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to legally begin their exploration of the continental west, which Spain had prohibited.

Almost all of the historic buildings associated with this period had been replaced by newer buildings. His idea was to raze all of the buildings in the original St. Louis platted area and replace it with a park with &quot;a central feature, a shaft, a building, an arch, or something which would symbolize American culture and civilization.&quot;

Smith pitched the idea to Bernard Dickmann who quickly assembled a meeting of St. Louis civic leaders on December 15, 1933, at the Jefferson Hotel and they endorsed the plan and Smith became chairman of what would become the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial Association (a position he would hold until 1949 with a one-year exception).

The Commission then defined the area, got cost estimates of $30 million to buy the land, clear the buildings and erect a park and monument. With promises from the federal government (via the United States Territorial Expansion Memorial Commission) to join if the City of St. Louis could raise money.

The area to be included in the park was bounded by the Eads Bridge/Washington Avenue on the north and Poplar Street on the south, the Mississippi River on the east and Third Street (now Interstate 44) on the west. The Old Courthouse, just west of Third Street, was added in 1940.

The only building in this area not included was the Old Cathedral, which is on the site of St. Louis first church and was opposite the home of St. Louis founder Auguste Chouteau. The founders of the city were buried in its graveyard (but were moved in 1849 to Bellefontaine Cemetery during a cholera outbreak).
Taking away 40 blocks in the center of St. Louis was bitterly fought by some sources—particularly the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;. On September 10, 1935, the voters of St. Louis supposedly approved a $7.5 million bond issue to buy the property. Local architect Louis LaBeaume provided a preliminary design proposal for the site that included multiple museums, fountains and obelisks. Soon after, it was revealed that the election was rigged, and the true number of voters in favor of the demolition of the riverfront is unknown.

The buildings were bought for $7 million by the federal government via Eminent domain and was subject to considerable litigation but were ultimately bought at 131.99 percent of assessed valuation. Roosevelt inspected the memorial area on October 14, 1936, during the dedication of the St. Louis Soldiers Memorial. Included in the party was then Senator Harry S. Truman.

===1940s===
The land was to be cleared by 1942. Among the buildings razed was the &quot;Old Rock House&quot; 1818 home of fur trader Manuel Lisa (now occupied by the stairs on the north side of the arch) and the 1819 home of original St. Louis pioneer Jean Pierre Chouteau at First (Main) and Washington streets.

The architectural competition for a monument was delayed by World War II. Interest in the monument was fed after the war as it was to be the first big monument in the post-World War II era.

The estimated cost of the competition was $225,000 and Smith personally donated $40,000. Civic leaders held the nationwide competition in 1947 to select a design for the main portion of the Memorial space.

Architect Eero Saarinen won this competition with plans for a catenary arch to be placed on the banks of the Mississippi River. However, these plans were modified over the next 15 years, placing the arch on higher ground and adding in height and width.

The central architectural feature at the base of the arch is the Old Courthouse, which was once the tallest building in Missouri and has a dome similar to the United States Capitol and was placed on the building during the American Civil War at the same time as that on the U.S. Capitol.

Saarinen developed the shape with the help of architectural engineer Hannskarl Bandel. It is not a pure inverted catenary. Saarinen preferred a shape that was slightly elongated and thinner towards the top, a shape that produces a subtle soaring effect, and transfers more of the structure&#x27;s weight downward rather than outward at the base.

When Saarinen won the competition, the official notification was sent to &quot;E. Saarinen&quot;, thinking it to be the architect&#x27;s father Eliel Saarinen, who had also submitted an entry. The family celebrated with a bottle of champagne, and two hours later an embarrassed official called to say the winner was, in fact, the younger Saarinen. The elder Saarinen then broke out a second bottle of champagne to celebrate his son&#x27;s success.

Among the five finalists was local St. Louis architect Harris Armstrong.

===1950s===
Land for the memorial was formally dedicated on June 10, 1950, by Harry S. Truman. However, the Korean War began and the project was put on hold.

On June 23, 1959, work begins on covering railroad tracks that cut across the memorial grounds.

===1960s===
On February 11, 1961, excavation began, and that September 1, Saarinen died. On February 12, 1963, the first stainless steel triangle that formed the first section of the arch was set in place on the south leg.

On October 28, 1965, it was completed, costing approximately $15 million to build. The adjacent park was designed by landscape architect Dan Kiley. Along with all other historical areas of the National Park Service, the memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. Vice President Hubert Humphrey and Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall dedicated the arch on May 25, 1968.

===1980s===
In 1984, Congress authorized the enlargement of the Memorial to include up to on the east bank of the Mississippi River in East St. Louis, Illinois. Funds were authorized to begin land acquisition, but Congress placed a moratorium upon NPS land acquisitions in fiscal year 1998. The moratorium continued into the 21st century, with expansion becoming less likely because of the construction of a riverboat gambling facility and related amenities.

===1990s===
During the Great Flood of 1993, Mississippi flood waters reached halfway up the Grand Staircase on the east.

In 1999, the arch tram queue areas were renovated at a cost of about $2.2 million. As well, the Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site in St. Louis County, Missouri, was put under the jurisdiction of the Superintendent of the Memorial.

===2000s===

The arch was featured on the Missouri state quarter in 2003.

In 2007 St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay and former Missouri Senator John Danforth asked the National Park Service to create a more &quot;active&quot; use of the grounds of the memorial and model it on Millennium Park in Chicago including the possibility of restaurants, fountains, ice skating, swimming, and other activities. The National Park Service was not in favor of the plan noting that the only other overt development pressure on national park property has been at the Jackson Hole Airport in Grand Teton National Park

===2010s===
====Renovations====
For most of its existence, the Memorial was largely separated from the rest of Downtown St. Louis by a sunken section of I-70 (now I-44 with the rerouting of I-70 over a new bridge), but in 2014, a lid was installed over the highway, creating the foundation for a park connecting downtown with the Memorial grounds. In November 2015, Saarinen&#x27;s original master plan was brought to fruition. Building of the Gateway Arch Connector linking the Old Courthouse with the grounds of the arch was completed. This design, and other design components were imagined by Michael Van Valkenburg Associates. In September 2010 Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates won a design contest to &quot;re-envision the visitor experience&quot; of the grounds. The project, originally planned for completion in 2015 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the opening of the arch, was completed in 2018. It includes:
*replacing the north garage with an outdoor amphitheater, an explorers garden for children and an addition of 7.5 acres of green space. 
*new cobblestone plaza between the arch and the river
*elevated walkways on the Illinois side, reaching 35 feet and winding through a new bird sanctuary, (Congress has authorized the purchase of the Illinois acreage)
*an expanded museum below the Gateway Arch with a new western entrance nearly a block closer to downtown than the original entrances.

In 2016, many ash trees on the grounds were removed to preempt damage from emerald ash borers. Prior to the work of CityArchRiver, there were 1,800 trees on the grounds. There are now 4,200.

The $380 million project was funded both privately and publicly. The public funding, provided largely by Proposition P, totaled $159 million. The remaining $221 million were secured via fundraising efforts of Gateway Arch Park foundation.

====Redesignation====
On June 26, 2017, Senator Roy Blunt (R-Missouri) introduced the Gateway Arch National Park Designation Act () to redesignate Jefferson National Expansion Memorial as Gateway Arch National Park. The legislation was cosponsored by Senator Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri).

In July 2017, Acting Deputy Director of the National Park Service Robert Vogel testified before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on National Parks. Vogel stated that the Department of the Interior supported changing the name to Gateway Arch National Monument, rather than National Park, to maintain consistency with existing naming conventions. He likened the site to the Statue of Liberty National Monument, noting that existing national parks encompassed thousands of acres at minimum and that the memorial &quot;is too small and limited in the range of resources the site protects and interprets to be called a national park&quot;.

The United States Congress approved the bill in early 2018. U.S. President Donald Trump signed the act into law on February 22, 2018, officially renaming the site Gateway Arch National Park.

The new designation has been seen as an attempt to increase tourism in St. Louis. The name has been criticized as inappropriate by some visitors.

== Chouteau Greenway ==
The Chouteau Greenway Project is a public-private partnership that aims to connect Forest Park and the Washington University in St. Louis Danforth Campus to Gateway Arch National Park. Among the partners leading this project are the Arch to Park Collaborative, St. Louis City, and Washington University in St. Louis.

<doc id="49460" wikidata="Q839405" url="?curid=49460" title="Boole's syllogistic">
<text>[[Boolean logic]] is a system of syllogistic logic invented by 19th-century British mathematician George Boole, which attempts to incorporate the &quot;empty set&quot;, that is, a class of non-existent entities, such as round squares, without resorting to uncertain truth values.

In Boolean logic, the universal statements &quot;all S is P&quot; and &quot;no S is P&quot; (contraries in the traditional Aristotelian schema) are compossible provided that the set of &quot;S&quot; is the empty set. &quot;All S is P&quot; is construed to mean that &quot;there is nothing that is both S and not-P&quot;; &quot;no S is P&quot;, that &quot;there is nothing that is both S and P&quot;. For example, since there is nothing that is a round square, it is true both that nothing is a round square and purple, and that nothing is a round square and &quot;not&quot;-purple. Therefore, both universal statements, that &quot;all round squares are purple&quot; and &quot;no round squares are purple&quot; are true.

Similarly, the subcontrary relationship is dissolved between the existential statements &quot;some S is P&quot; and &quot;some S is not P&quot;. The former is interpreted as &quot;there is some S such that S is P&quot; and the latter, &quot;there is some S such that S is not P&quot;, both of which are clearly false where S is nonexistent.

Thus, the subaltern relationship between universal and existential also does not hold, since for a nonexistent S, &quot;All S is P&quot; is true but does not entail &quot;Some S is P&quot;, which is false. Of the Aristotelian square of opposition, only the contradictory relationships remain intact.

<doc id="49463" wikidata="Q1364296" url="?curid=49463" title="Upper and Lower Egypt">
<text>In Egyptian history, the Upper and Lower Egypt period (also known as The Two Lands) was the final stage of prehistoric Egypt and directly preceded the unification of the realm. The conception of Egypt as the Two Lands was an example of the dualism in ancient Egyptian culture and frequently appeared in texts and imagery, including in the titles of Egyptian pharaohs.

The Egyptian title &quot;-&quot; (Egyptological pronunciation &quot;sema-tawy&quot;) is usually translated as &quot;Uniter of the Two Lands&quot; and was depicted as a human trachea entwined with the papyrus and lily plant. The trachea stood for unification, while the papyrus and lily plant represent Lower and Upper Egypt.

Standard titles of the pharaoh included the prenomen, quite literally &quot;Of the Sedge and Bee&quot; (, the symbols of Upper and Lower Egypt) and &quot;lord of the Two Lands&quot; (written &quot;&quot;). Queens regnant were addressed as pharaohs and male. Queens consort might use a feminine versions of the second title, &quot;lady of The Two Lands&quot; (&quot;nbt-tꜣwj&quot;), &quot;mistress of the Entire Two Lands&quot; (&quot;hnwt-tꜣwy-tm&quot;), and &quot;mistress of the Two Lands&quot; (&quot;hnwt-tꜣwy&quot;).

==Structure==

Ancient Egypt was divided into two regions, namely Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt. To the north was Lower Egypt, where the Nile stretched out with its several branches to form the Nile Delta. To the south was Upper Egypt, stretching to Aswan. The terminology and derives from the flow of the Nile from the highlands of East Africa northwards to the Mediterranean Sea.

The two kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt were united c. 3000 BC, but each maintained its own regalia: the &quot;hedjet&quot; or White Crown for Upper Egypt and the &quot;deshret&quot; or Red Crown for Lower Egypt. Thus, the pharaohs were known as the rulers of the Two Lands, and wore the &quot;pschent&quot;, a double crown, each half representing sovereignty of one of the kingdoms. Ancient Egyptian tradition credited Menes, now believed to be the same as Narmer, as the king who united Upper and Lower Egypt. On the Narmer Palette, the king is depicted wearing the Red Crown on one scene and the White crown in another, and thereby showing his rule over both Lands.

==Sema Tawy and symbolism==

The union of Upper and Lower Egypt is depicted by knotted papyrus and reed plants. The binding motif represents both harmony through linkage and domination through containment. The duality is an important part of royal iconography. Sometimes, the duality is further extended by having the knotted plants extend and bind foreign foes (both from the North and the South) as well.

During the first dynasty, dualistic royal titles emerge, including the King of Upper and Lower Egypt (&quot; &quot;) title which combines the plant representing Upper Egypt and a bee representing Lower Egypt. The other dualistic title is the Two Ladies name or Nebty name. The two ladies are Nekhbet, the vulture goddess associated with Nekhen in Upper Egypt, and Wadjet, the cobra goddess associated with Buto in Lower Egypt.

There are many depictions of the ritual unifications of the Two Lands. It is not known if this was perhaps a rite that would have been enacted at the beginning of a reign, or merely a symbolic representation. Many of the depictions of the unification show two gods binding the plants. Often the gods are Horus and Set, or on occasion Horus and Thoth. There are several examples of Barque stands from the reigns of Amenhotep III (Hermopolis), Taharqa (Jebel Barkal), and Atlanersa (Jebel Barkal) that show two river gods performing the rite. This matches a scene from the Temple at Abu Simbel from the time of Ramesses II.

There are only a handful of scenes that show the King himself performing the ritual. All of these are from barque stands and date to the reigns of Amenhotep III, Seti I and Ramesses III. The latter two may be copies of the first one.

<doc id="49471" wikidata="Q28246" url="?curid=49471" title="Osiris myth">
<text>The Osiris myth is the most elaborate and influential story in ancient Egyptian mythology. It concerns the murder of the god Osiris, a primeval king of Egypt, and its consequences. Osiris&#x27;s murderer, his brother Set, usurps his throne. Meanwhile, Osiris&#x27;s wife Isis restores her husband&#x27;s body, allowing him to posthumously conceive their son, Horus. The remainder of the story focuses on Horus, the product of the union of Isis and Osiris, who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set&#x27;s rival for the throne. Their often violent conflict ends with Horus&#x27;s triumph, which restores &quot;maat&quot; (cosmic and social order) to Egypt after Set&#x27;s unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris&#x27;s resurrection.

The myth, with its complex symbolism, is integral to ancient Egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession, conflict between order and disorder, and especially death and the afterlife. It also expresses the essential character of each of the four deities at its center, and many elements of their worship in ancient Egyptian religion were derived from the myth.

The Osiris myth reached its basic form in or before the 24th century BCE. Many of its elements originated in religious ideas, but the struggle between Horus and Set may have been partly inspired by a regional conflict in Predynastic or Early Dynastic times. Scholars have tried to discern the exact nature of the events that gave rise to the story, but they have reached no definitive conclusions.

Parts of the myth appear in a wide variety of Egyptian texts, from funerary texts and magical spells to short stories. The story is, therefore, more detailed and more cohesive than any other ancient Egyptian myth. Yet no Egyptian source gives a full account of the myth, and the sources vary widely in their versions of events. Greek and Roman writings, particularly &quot;On Isis and Osiris&quot; by Plutarch, provide more information but may not always accurately reflect Egyptian beliefs. Through these writings, the Osiris myth persisted after knowledge of most ancient Egyptian beliefs was lost, and it is still well known today.

==Sources==
The myth of Osiris was deeply influential in ancient Egyptian religion and was popular among ordinary people. One reason for this popularity is the myth&#x27;s primary religious meaning, which implies that any dead person can reach a pleasant afterlife. Another reason is that the characters and their emotions are more reminiscent of the lives of real people than those in most Egyptian myths, making the story more appealing to the general populace. In particular, the myth conveys a &quot;strong sense of family loyalty and devotion&quot;, as the Egyptologist J. Gwyn Griffiths puts it, in the relationships between Osiris, Isis, and Horus.

With this widespread appeal, the myth appears in more ancient texts than any other myth and in an exceptionally broad range of Egyptian literary styles. These sources also provide an unusual amount of detail. Ancient Egyptian myths are fragmentary and vague; the religious metaphors contained within the myths were more important than coherent narration. Each text that contains a myth, or a fragment of one, may adapt the myth to suit its particular purposes, so different texts can contain contradictory versions of events. Because the Osiris myth was used in such a variety of ways, versions often conflict with each other. Nevertheless, the fragmentary versions, taken together, give it a greater resemblance to a cohesive story than most Egyptian myths.
The earliest mentions of the Osiris myth are in the Pyramid Texts, the first Egyptian funerary texts, which appeared on the walls of burial chambers in pyramids at the end of the Fifth Dynasty, during the 24th century BCE. These texts, made up of disparate spells or &quot;utterances&quot;, contain ideas that are presumed to date from still earlier times. The texts are concerned with the afterlife of the king buried in the pyramid, so they frequently refer to the Osiris myth, which is deeply involved with kingship and the afterlife. Major elements of the story, such as the death and restoration of Osiris and the strife between Horus and Set, appear in the utterances of the Pyramid Texts. Funerary texts written in later times, such as the Coffin Texts from the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BCE) and the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; from the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BCE), also contain elements of the myth.

Other types of religious texts give evidence for the myth, such as two Middle Kingdom texts: the Dramatic Ramesseum Papyrus and the Ikhernofret Stela. The papyrus describes the coronation of Senusret I, whereas the stela alludes to events in the annual festival of Khoiak. Rituals in both these festivals reenacted elements of the Osiris myth. The most complete ancient Egyptian account of the myth is the Great Hymn to Osiris, an inscription from the Eighteenth Dynasty (c. 1550–1292 BCE) that gives the general outline of the entire story but includes little detail. Another important source is the Memphite Theology, a religious narrative that includes an account of Osiris&#x27;s death as well as the resolution of the dispute between Horus and Set. This narrative associates the kingship that Osiris and Horus represent with Ptah, the creator deity of Memphis. The text was long thought to date back to the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BCE) and was treated as a source for information about the early stages in the development of the myth. Since the 1970s, however, Egyptologists have concluded that the text dates to the New Kingdom at the earliest.

Rituals in honor of Osiris are another major source of information. Some of these texts are found on the walls of temples that date from the New Kingdom, the Ptolemaic era (323–30 BCE), or the Roman era (30 BCE to the fourth century AD). Some of these late ritual texts, in which Isis and Nephthys lament their brother&#x27;s death, were adapted into funerary texts. In these texts, the goddesses&#x27; pleas were meant to rouse Osiris—and thus the deceased person—to live again.

Magical healing spells, which were used by Egyptians of all classes, are the source for an important portion of the myth, in which Horus is poisoned or otherwise sickened, and Isis heals him. The spells identify a sick person with Horus so that he or she can benefit from the goddess&#x27;s efforts. The spells are known from papyrus copies, which serve as instructions for healing rituals, and from a specialized type of inscribed stone stela called a &quot;cippus&quot;. People seeking healing poured water over these cippi, an act that was believed to imbue the water with the healing power contained in the text, and then drank the water in hope of curing their ailments. The theme of an endangered child protected by magic also appears on inscribed ritual wands from the Middle Kingdom, which were made centuries before the more detailed healing spells that specifically connect this theme with the Osiris myth.

Episodes from the myth were also recorded in writings that may have been intended as entertainment. Prominent among these texts is &quot;The Contendings of Horus and Set&quot;, a humorous retelling of several episodes of the struggle between the two deities, which dates to the Twentieth Dynasty (c. 1190–1070 BCE). It vividly characterizes the deities involved; as the Egyptologist Donald B. Redford says, &quot;Horus appears as a physically weak but clever Puck-like figure, Seth [Set] as a strong-man buffoon of limited intelligence, Re-Horakhty [Ra] as a prejudiced, sulky judge, and Osiris as an articulate curmudgeon with an acid tongue.&quot; Despite its atypical nature, &quot;Contendings&quot; includes many of the oldest episodes in the divine conflict, and many events appear in the same order as in much later accounts, suggesting that a traditional sequence of events was forming at the time that the story was written.

Ancient Greek and Roman writers, who described Egyptian religion late in its history, recorded much of the Osiris myth. Herodotus, in the 5th century BCE, mentioned parts of the myth in his description of Egypt in the &quot;Histories&quot;, and four centuries later, Diodorus Siculus provided a summary of the myth in his &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot;. In the early 2nd century AD, Plutarch wrote the most complete ancient account of the myth in &quot;On Isis and Osiris&quot;, an analysis of Egyptian religious beliefs. Plutarch&#x27;s account of the myth is the version that modern popular writings most frequently retell. The writings of these classical authors may give a distorted view of Egyptian beliefs. For instance, &quot;On Isis and Osiris&quot; includes many interpretations of Egyptian belief that are influenced by various Greek philosophies, and its account of the myth contains portions with no known parallel in Egyptian tradition. Griffiths concluded that several elements of this account were taken from Greek mythology, and that the work as a whole was not based directly on Egyptian sources. His colleague John Baines, on the other hand, says that temples may have kept written accounts of myths that were later lost, and that Plutarch could have drawn on such sources to write his narrative.

==Synopsis==
===Death and resurrection of Osiris===
At the start of the story, Osiris rules Egypt, having inherited the kingship from his ancestors in a lineage stretching back to the creator of the world, Ra or Atum. His queen is Isis, who, along with Osiris and his murderer, Set, is one of the children of the earth god Geb and the sky goddess Nut. Little information about the reign of Osiris appears in Egyptian sources; the focus is on his death and the events that follow. Osiris is connected with life-giving power, righteous kingship, and the rule of &quot;maat&quot;, the ideal natural order whose maintenance was a fundamental goal in ancient Egyptian culture. Set is closely associated with violence and chaos. Therefore, the slaying of Osiris symbolizes the struggle between order and disorder, and the disruption of life by death.

Some versions of the myth provide Set&#x27;s motive for killing Osiris. According to a spell in the &quot;Pyramid Texts&quot;, Set is taking revenge for a kick Osiris gave him, whereas in a Late Period text, Set&#x27;s grievance is that Osiris had sex with Nephthys, who is Set&#x27;s consort and the fourth child of Geb and Nut. The murder itself is frequently alluded to, but never clearly described. The Egyptians believed that written words had the power to affect reality, so they avoided writing directly about profoundly negative events such as Osiris&#x27;s death. Sometimes they denied his death altogether, even though the bulk of the traditions about him make it clear that he has been murdered. In some cases the texts suggest that Set takes the form of a wild animal, such as a crocodile or bull, to slay Osiris; in others they imply that Osiris&#x27;s corpse is thrown in the water or that he is drowned. This latter tradition is the origin of the Egyptian belief that people who had drowned in the Nile were sacred. Even the identity of the victim can vary, as it is sometimes the god Haroeris, an elder form of Horus, who is murdered by Set and then avenged by another form of Horus, who is Haroeris&#x27;s son by Isis.

By the end of the New Kingdom, a tradition had developed that Set had cut Osiris&#x27;s body into pieces and scattered them across Egypt. Cult centers of Osiris all over the country claimed that the corpse, or particular pieces of it, were found near them. The dismembered parts could be said to number as many as forty-two, each piece being equated with one of the forty-two nomes, or provinces, in Egypt. Thus the god of kingship becomes the embodiment of his kingdom.
Osiris&#x27;s death is followed either by an interregnum or by a period in which Set assumes the kingship. Meanwhile, Isis searches for her husband&#x27;s body with the aid of Nephthys. When searching for or mourning Osiris, the two goddesses are often likened to falcons or kites, possibly because kites travel far in search of carrion, because the Egyptians associated their plaintive calls with cries of grief, or because of the goddesses&#x27; connection with Horus, who is often represented as a falcon. In the New Kingdom, when Osiris&#x27;s death and renewal came to be associated with the annual flooding of the Nile that fertilized Egypt, the waters of the Nile were equated with Isis&#x27;s tears of mourning or with Osiris&#x27;s bodily fluids. Osiris thus represented the life-giving divine power that was present in the river&#x27;s water and in the plants that grew after the flood.

The goddesses find and restore Osiris&#x27;s body, often with the help of other deities, including Thoth, a deity credited with great magical and healing powers, and Anubis, the god of embalming and funerary rites. Osiris becomes the first mummy, and the gods&#x27; efforts to restore his body are the mythological basis for Egyptian embalming practices, which sought to prevent and reverse the decay that follows death. This part of the story is often extended with episodes in which Set or his followers try to damage the corpse, and Isis and her allies must protect it. Once Osiris is made whole, Isis conceives his son and rightful heir, Horus. One ambiguous spell in the Coffin Texts may indicate that Isis is impregnated by a flash of lightning, while in other sources, Isis, still in bird form, fans breath and life into Osiris&#x27;s body with her wings and copulates with him. Osiris&#x27;s revival is apparently not permanent, and after this point in the story he is only mentioned as the ruler of the Duat, the distant and mysterious realm of the dead. Although he lives on only in the Duat, he and the kingship he stands for will, in a sense, be reborn in his son.

The cohesive account by Plutarch, which deals mainly with this portion of the myth, differs in many respects from the known Egyptian sources. Set—whom Plutarch, using Greek names for many of the Egyptian deities, refers to as &quot;Typhon&quot;—conspires against Osiris with seventy-two unspecified accomplices, as well as a queen from ancient Aethiopia (Nubia). Set has an elaborate chest made to fit Osiris&#x27;s exact measurements and then, at a banquet, declares that he will give the chest as a gift to whoever fits inside it. The guests, in turn, lie inside the coffin, but none fit inside except Osiris. When he lies down in the chest, Set and his accomplices slam the cover shut, seal it, and throw it into the Nile. With Osiris&#x27;s corpse inside, the chest floats out into the sea, arriving at the city of Byblos, where a tree grows around it. The king of Byblos has the tree cut down and made into a pillar for his palace, still with the chest inside. Isis must remove the chest from within the tree in order to retrieve her husband&#x27;s body. Having taken the chest, she leaves the tree in Byblos, where it becomes an object of worship for the locals. This episode, which is not known from Egyptian sources, gives an etiological explanation for a cult of Isis and Osiris that existed in Byblos in Plutarch&#x27;s time and possibly as early as the New Kingdom.

Plutarch also states that Set steals and dismembers the corpse only after Isis has retrieved it. Isis then finds and buries each piece of her husband&#x27;s body, with the exception of the penis, which she has to reconstruct with magic, because the original was eaten by fish in the river. According to Plutarch, this is the reason the Egyptians had a taboo against eating fish. In Egyptian accounts, however, the penis of Osiris is found intact, and the only close parallel with this part of Plutarch&#x27;s story is in &quot;The Tale of Two Brothers&quot;, a folk tale from the New Kingdom with similarities to the Osiris myth.

A final difference in Plutarch&#x27;s account is Horus&#x27;s birth. The form of Horus that avenges his father has been conceived and born before Osiris&#x27;s death. It is a premature and weak second child, Harpocrates, who is born from Osiris&#x27;s posthumous union with Isis. Here, two of the separate forms of Horus that exist in Egyptian tradition have been given distinct positions within Plutarch&#x27;s version of the myth.

===Birth and childhood of Horus===

In Egyptian accounts, the pregnant Isis hides from Set, to whom the unborn child is a threat, in a thicket of papyrus in the Nile Delta. This place is called &quot;Akh-bity&quot;, meaning &quot;papyrus thicket of the king of Lower Egypt&quot; in Egyptian. Greek writers call this place &quot;Khemmis&quot; and indicate that it is near the city of Buto, but in the myth, the physical location is less important than its nature as an iconic place of seclusion and safety. The thicket&#x27;s special status is indicated by its frequent depiction in Egyptian art; for most events in Egyptian mythology, the backdrop is minimally described or illustrated. In this thicket, Isis gives birth to Horus and raises him, and hence it is also called the &quot;nest of Horus&quot;. The image of Isis nursing her child is a very common motif in Egyptian art.

There are texts such as the Metternich Stela that date to the Late Period in which Isis travels in the wider world. She moves among ordinary humans who are unaware of her identity, and she even appeals to these people for help. This is another unusual circumstance, for in Egyptian myth, gods and humans are normally separate. As in the first phase of the myth, she often has the aid of other deities, who protect her son in her absence. According to one magical spell, seven minor scorpion deities travel with and guard Isis as she seeks help for Horus. They even take revenge on a wealthy woman who has refused to help Isis by stinging the woman&#x27;s son, making it necessary for Isis to heal the blameless child. This story conveys a moral message that the poor can be more virtuous than the wealthy and illustrates Isis&#x27;s fair and compassionate nature.

In this stage of the myth, Horus is a vulnerable child beset by dangers. The magical texts that use Horus&#x27;s childhood as the basis for their healing spells give him different ailments, from scorpion stings to simple stomachaches, adapting the tradition to fit the malady that each spell was intended to treat. Most commonly, the child god has been bitten by a snake, reflecting the Egyptians&#x27; fear of snakebite and the resulting poison. Some texts indicate that these hostile creatures are agents of Set. Isis may use her own magical powers to save her child, or she may plead with or threaten deities such as Ra or Geb, so they will cure him. As she is the archetypal mourner in the first portion of the story, so during Horus&#x27;s childhood she is the ideal devoted mother. Through the magical healing texts, her efforts to heal her son are extended to cure any patient.

===Conflict of Horus and Set===
The next phase of the myth begins when the adult Horus challenges Set for the throne of Egypt. The contest between them is often violent but is also described as a legal judgment before the Ennead, an assembled group of Egyptian deities, to decide who should inherit the kingship. The judge in this trial may be Geb, who, as the father of Osiris and Set, held the throne before they did, or it may be the creator gods Ra or Atum, the originators of kingship. Other deities also take important roles: Thoth frequently acts as a conciliator in the dispute or as an assistant to the divine judge, and in &quot;Contendings&quot;, Isis uses her cunning and magical power to aid her son.

The rivalry of Horus and Set is portrayed in two contrasting ways. Both perspectives appear as early as the &quot;Pyramid Texts&quot;, the earliest source of the myth. In some spells from these texts, Horus is the son of Osiris and nephew of Set, and the murder of Osiris is the major impetus for the conflict. The other tradition depicts Horus and Set as brothers. This incongruity persists in many of the subsequent sources, where the two gods may be called brothers or uncle and nephew at different points in the same text.
The divine struggle involves many episodes. &quot;Contendings&quot; describes the two gods appealing to various other deities to arbitrate the dispute and competing in different types of contests, such as racing in boats or fighting each other in the form of hippopotami, to determine a victor. In this account, Horus repeatedly defeats Set and is supported by most of the other deities. Yet the dispute drags on for eighty years, largely because the judge, the creator god, favors Set. In late ritual texts, the conflict is characterized as a great battle involving the two deities&#x27; assembled followers. The strife in the divine realm extends beyond the two combatants. At one point Isis attempts to harpoon Set as he is locked in combat with her son, but she strikes Horus instead, who then cuts off her head in a fit of rage. Thoth replaces Isis&#x27;s head with that of a cow; the story gives a mythical origin for the cow-horn headdress that Isis commonly wears.

In a key episode in the conflict, Set sexually abuses Horus. Set&#x27;s violation is partly meant to degrade his rival, but it also involves homosexual desire, in keeping with one of Set&#x27;s major characteristics, his forceful and indiscriminate sexuality. In the earliest account of this episode, in a fragmentary Middle Kingdom papyrus, the sexual encounter begins when Set asks to have sex with Horus, who agrees on the condition that Set will give Horus some of his strength. The encounter puts Horus in danger, because in Egyptian tradition semen is a potent and dangerous substance, akin to poison. According to some texts, Set&#x27;s semen enters Horus&#x27;s body and makes him ill, but in &quot;Contendings&quot;, Horus thwarts Set by catching Set&#x27;s semen in his hands. Isis retaliates by putting Horus&#x27;s semen on lettuce-leaves that Set eats. Set&#x27;s defeat becomes apparent when this semen appears on his forehead as a golden disk. He has been impregnated with his rival&#x27;s seed and as a result &quot;gives birth&quot; to the disk. In &quot;Contendings&quot;, Thoth takes the disk and places it on his own head; other accounts imply that Thoth himself was produced by this anomalous birth.

Another important episode concerns mutilations that the combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set&#x27;s testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus&#x27;s eyes. Sometimes the eye is torn into pieces. Set&#x27;s mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength. The removal of Horus&#x27;s eye is even more important, for this stolen Eye of Horus represents a wide variety of concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus&#x27;s major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set&#x27;s loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set&#x27;s head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus&#x27;s Eye when it appears on Set&#x27;s head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge in the form of the Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.

In any case, the restoration of the Eye of Horus to wholeness represents the return of the moon to full brightness, the return of the kingship to Horus, and many other aspects of &quot;maat&quot;. Sometimes the restoration of Horus&#x27;s eye is accompanied by the restoration of Set&#x27;s testicles, so that both gods are made whole near the conclusion of their feud.

===Resolution===
As with so many other parts of the myth, the resolution is complex and varied. Often, Horus and Set divide the realm between them. This division can be equated with any of several fundamental dualities that the Egyptians saw in their world. Horus may receive the fertile lands around the Nile, the core of Egyptian civilization, in which case Set takes the barren desert or the foreign lands that are associated with it; Horus may rule the earth while Set dwells in the sky; and each god may take one of the two traditional halves of the country, Upper and Lower Egypt, in which case either god may be connected with either region. Yet in the Memphite Theology, Geb, as judge, first apportions the realm between the claimants and then reverses himself, awarding sole control to Horus. In this peaceable union, Horus and Set are reconciled, and the dualities that they represent have been resolved into a united whole. Through this resolution, order is restored after the tumultuous conflict.

A different view of the myth&#x27;s end focuses on Horus&#x27;s sole triumph. In this version, Set is not reconciled with his rival but utterly defeated, and sometimes he is exiled from Egypt or even destroyed. His defeat and humiliation is more pronounced in sources from later periods of Egyptian history, when he was increasingly equated with disorder and evil, and the Egyptians no longer saw him as an integral part of natural order.

With great celebration among the gods, Horus takes the throne, and Egypt finally has a rightful king. The divine decision that Set is in the wrong corrects the injustice created by Osiris&#x27;s murder and completes the process of his restoration after death. Sometimes Set is made to carry Osiris&#x27;s body to its tomb as part of his punishment. The new king performs funerary rites for his father and gives food offerings to sustain him—often including the Eye of Horus, which in this instance represents life and plenty. According to some sources, only through these acts can Osiris be fully enlivened in the afterlife and take his place as king of the dead, paralleling his son&#x27;s role as king of the living. Thereafter, Osiris is deeply involved with natural cycles of death and renewal, such as the annual growth of crops, that parallel his own resurrection.

An alternate version of the myths where Set is defeated has Osiris return to life after the fight between Set and Horus.

==Origins==
As the Osiris myth first appears in the &quot;Pyramid Texts&quot;, most of its essential features must have taken shape sometime before the texts were written down. The distinct segments of the story—Osiris&#x27;s death and restoration, Horus&#x27;s childhood, and Horus&#x27;s conflict with Set—may originally have been independent mythic episodes. If so, they must have begun to coalesce into a single story by the time of the &quot;Pyramid Texts&quot;, which loosely connect those segments. In any case, the myth was inspired by a variety of influences. Much of the story is based in religious ideas and the general nature of Egyptian society: the divine nature of kingship, the succession from one king to another, the struggle to maintain &quot;maat&quot;, and the effort to overcome death. For instance, the lamentations of Isis and Nephthys for their dead brother may represent an early tradition of ritualized mourning.

There are, however, important points of disagreement. The origins of Osiris are much debated, and the basis for the myth of his death is also somewhat uncertain. One influential hypothesis was given by the anthropologist James Frazer, who in 1906 said that Osiris, like other &quot;dying and rising gods&quot; across the ancient Near East, began as a personification of vegetation. His death and restoration, therefore, were based on the yearly death and re-growth of plants. Many Egyptologists adopted this explanation. But in the late 20th century, J. Gwyn Griffiths, who extensively studied Osiris and his mythology, argued that Osiris originated as a divine ruler of the dead, and his connection with vegetation was a secondary development. Meanwhile, scholars of comparative religion have criticized the overarching concept of &quot;dying and rising gods&quot;, or at least Frazer&#x27;s assumption that all these gods closely fit the same pattern. More recently, the Egyptologist Rosalie David maintains that Osiris originally &quot;personified the annual rebirth of the trees and plants after the [Nile] inundation.&quot;
Another continuing debate concerns the opposition of Horus and Set, which Egyptologists have often tried to connect with political events early in Egypt&#x27;s history or prehistory. The cases in which the combatants divide the kingdom, and the frequent association of the paired Horus and Set with the union of Upper and Lower Egypt, suggest that the two deities represent some kind of division within the country. Egyptian tradition and archaeological evidence indicate that Egypt was united at the beginning of its history when an Upper Egyptian kingdom, in the south, conquered Lower Egypt in the north. The Upper Egyptian rulers called themselves &quot;followers of Horus&quot;, and Horus became the patron god of the unified nation and its kings. Yet Horus and Set cannot be easily equated with the two halves of the country. Both deities had several cult centers in each region, and Horus is often associated with Lower Egypt and Set with Upper Egypt. One of the better-known explanations for these discrepancies was proposed by Kurt Sethe in 1930. He argued that Osiris was originally the human ruler of a unified Egypt in prehistoric times, before a rebellion of Upper Egyptian Set-worshippers. The Lower Egyptian followers of Horus then forcibly reunified the land, inspiring the myth of Horus&#x27;s triumph, before Upper Egypt, now led by Horus worshippers, became prominent again at the start of the Early Dynastic Period.

In the late 20th century, Griffiths focused on the inconsistent portrayal of Horus and Set as brothers and as uncle and nephew. He argued that, in the early stages of Egyptian mythology, the struggle between Horus and Set as siblings and equals was originally separate from the murder of Osiris. The two stories were joined into the single Osiris myth sometime before the writing of the &quot;Pyramid Texts&quot;. With this merging, the genealogy of the deities involved and the characterization of the Horus–Set conflict were altered so that Horus is the son and heir avenging Osiris&#x27;s death. Traces of the independent traditions remained in the conflicting characterizations of the combatants&#x27; relationship and in texts unrelated to the Osiris myth, which make Horus the son of the goddess Nut or the goddess Hathor rather than of Isis and Osiris. Griffiths therefore rejected the possibility that Osiris&#x27;s murder was rooted in historical events. This hypothesis has been accepted by more recent scholars such as Jan Assmann and George Hart.

Griffiths sought a historical origin for the Horus–Set rivalry, and he posited two distinct predynastic unifications of Egypt by Horus worshippers, similar to Sethe&#x27;s theory, to account for it. Yet the issue remains unresolved, partly because other political associations for Horus and Set complicate the picture further. Before even Upper Egypt had a single ruler, two of its major cities were Nekhen, in the far south, and Naqada, many miles to the north. The rulers of Nekhen, where Horus was the patron deity, are generally believed to have unified Upper Egypt, including Naqada, under their sway. Set was associated with Naqada, so it is possible that the divine conflict dimly reflects an enmity between the cities in the distant past. Much later, at the end of the Second Dynasty (c. 2890–2686 BCE), King Peribsen used the Set animal in writing his &quot;serekh&quot;-name, in place of the traditional falcon hieroglyph representing Horus. His successor Khasekhemwy used both Horus and Set in the writing of his &quot;serekh&quot;. This evidence has prompted conjecture that the Second Dynasty saw a clash between the followers of the Horus-king and the worshippers of Set led by Peribsen. Khasekhemwy&#x27;s use of the two animal symbols would then represent the reconciliation of the two factions, as does the resolution of the myth.

Noting the uncertainty surrounding these events, Herman te Velde argues that the historical roots of the conflict are too obscure to be very useful in understanding the myth and are not as significant as its religious meaning. He says that &quot;the origin of the myth of Horus and Seth is lost in the mists of the religious traditions of prehistory.&quot;

==Influence==
The effect of the Osiris myth on Egyptian culture was greater and more widespread than that of any other myth. In literature, the myth was not only the basis for a retelling such as &quot;Contendings&quot;; it also provided the basis for more distantly related stories. &quot;The Tale of Two Brothers&quot;, a folk tale with human protagonists, includes elements similar to the myth of Osiris. One character&#x27;s penis is eaten by a fish, and he later dies and is resurrected. Another story, &quot;The Tale of Truth and Falsehood&quot;, adapts the conflict of Horus and Set into an allegory, in which the characters are direct personifications of truth and lies rather than deities associated with those concepts.

===Osiris and funerary ritual===

From at least the time of the &quot;Pyramid Texts&quot;, kings hoped that after their deaths they could emulate Osiris&#x27;s restoration to life and his rule over the realm of the dead. By the early Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BCE), non-royal Egyptians believed that they, too, could overcome death as Osiris had, by worshipping him and receiving the funerary rites that were partly based on his myth. Osiris thus became Egypt&#x27;s most important afterlife deity. The myth also influenced the notion, which grew prominent in the New Kingdom, that only virtuous people could reach the afterlife. As the assembled deities judged Osiris and Horus to be in the right, undoing the injustice of Osiris&#x27;s death, so a deceased soul had to be judged righteous in order for his or her death to be undone. As ruler of the land of the dead and as a god connected with &quot;maat&quot;, Osiris became the judge in this posthumous trial, offering life after death to those who followed his example. New Kingdom funerary texts such as the &quot;Amduat&quot; and the &quot;Book of Gates&quot; liken Ra himself to a deceased soul. In them, he travels through the Duat and unites with Osiris to be reborn at dawn. Thus, Osiris was not only believed to enable rebirth for the dead; he renewed the sun, the source of life and &quot;maat&quot;, and thus renewed the world itself.

As the importance of Osiris grew, so did his popularity. By late in the Middle Kingdom, the centuries-old tomb of the First Dynasty ruler Djer, near Osiris&#x27;s main center of worship in the city of Abydos, was seen as Osiris&#x27;s tomb. Accordingly, it became a major focus of Osiris worship. For the next 1,500 years, an annual festival procession traveled from Osiris&#x27;s main temple to the tomb site. Kings and commoners from across Egypt built chapels, which served as cenotaphs, near the processional route. In doing so they sought to strengthen their connection with Osiris in the afterlife.

Another major funerary festival, a national event spread over several days in the month of Khoiak in the Egyptian calendar, became linked with Osiris during the Middle Kingdom. During Khoiak the &quot;djed&quot; pillar, an emblem of Osiris, was ritually raised into an upright position, symbolizing Osiris&#x27;s restoration. By Ptolemaic times (305–30 BCE), Khoiak also included the planting of seeds in an &quot;Osiris bed&quot;, a mummy-shaped bed of soil, connecting the resurrection of Osiris with the seasonal growth of plants.

===Horus, the Eye of Horus, and kingship===
The myth&#x27;s religious importance extended beyond the funerary sphere. Mortuary offerings, in which family members or hired priests presented food to the deceased, were logically linked with the mythological offering of the Eye of Horus to Osiris. By analogy, this episode of the myth was eventually equated with other interactions between a human and a being in the divine realm. In temple offering rituals, the officiating priest took on the role of Horus, the gifts to the deity became the Eye of Horus, and whichever deity received these gifts was momentarily equated with Osiris.

The myth influenced popular religion as well. One example is the magical healing spells based on Horus&#x27;s childhood. Another is the use of the Eye of Horus as a protective emblem in personal apotropaic amulets. Its mythological restoration made it appropriate for this purpose, as a general symbol of well-being.

The ideology surrounding the living king was also affected by the Osiris myth. The Egyptians envisioned the events of the Osiris myth as taking place sometime in Egypt&#x27;s dim prehistory, and Osiris, Horus, and their divine predecessors were included in Egyptian lists of past kings such as the Turin Royal Canon. Horus, as a primeval king and as the personification of kingship, was regarded as the predecessor and exemplar for all Egyptian rulers. His assumption of his father&#x27;s throne and pious actions to sustain his spirit in the afterlife were the model for all pharaonic successions to emulate. Each new king was believed to renew &quot;maat&quot; after the death of the preceding king, just as Horus had done. In royal coronations, rituals alluded to Osiris&#x27;s burial, and hymns celebrated the new king&#x27;s accession as the equivalent of Horus&#x27;s own.

===Set===
The Osiris myth contributed to the frequent characterization of Set as a disruptive, harmful god. Although other elements of Egyptian tradition credit Set with positive traits, in the Osiris myth the sinister aspects of his character predominate. He and Horus were often juxtaposed in art to represent opposite principles, such as good and evil, intellect and instinct, and the different regions of the world that they rule in the myth. Egyptian wisdom texts contrast the character of the ideal person with the opposite type—the calm and sensible &quot;Silent One&quot; and the impulsive, disruptive &quot;Hothead&quot;—and one description of these two characters calls them the Horus-type and the Set-type. Yet the two gods were often treated as part of a harmonious whole. In some local cults they were worshipped together; in art they were often shown tying together the emblems of Upper and Lower Egypt to symbolize the unity of the nation; and in funerary texts they appear as a single deity with the heads of Horus and Set, apparently representing the mysterious, all-encompassing nature of the Duat.

Overall Set was viewed with ambivalence, until during the first millennium BCE he came to be seen as a totally malevolent deity. This transformation was prompted more by his association with foreign lands than by the Osiris myth. Nevertheless, in these late times, the widespread temple rituals involving the ceremonial annihilation of Set were often connected with the myth.

===Isis, Nephthys, and the Greco-Roman world===
Both Isis and Nephthys were seen as protectors of the dead in the afterlife because of their protection and restoration of Osiris&#x27;s body. The motif of Isis and Nephthys protecting Osiris or the mummy of the deceased person was very common in funerary art. Khoiak celebrations made reference to, and may have ritually reenacted, Isis&#x27;s and Nephthys&#x27;s mourning, restoration, and revival of their murdered brother. As Horus&#x27;s mother, Isis was also the mother of every king according to royal ideology, and kings were said to have nursed at her breast as a symbol of their divine legitimacy. Her appeal to the general populace was based in her protective character, as exemplified by the magical healing spells. In the Late Period, she was credited with ever greater magical power, and her maternal devotion was believed to extend to everyone. By Roman times she had become the most important goddess in Egypt. The image of the goddess holding her child was used prominently in her worship—for example, in panel paintings that were used in household shrines dedicated to her. Isis&#x27;s iconography in these paintings closely resembles and may have influenced the earliest Christian icons of Mary holding Jesus.

In the late centuries BCE, the worship of Isis spread from Egypt across the Mediterranean world, and she became one of the most popular deities in the region. Although this new, multicultural form of Isis absorbed characteristics from many other deities, her original mythological nature as a wife and mother was key to her appeal. Horus and Osiris, being central figures in her story, spread along with her. The Greek and Roman cult of Isis developed a series of initiation rites dedicated to Isis and Osiris, based on earlier Greco-Roman mystery rites but colored by Egyptian afterlife beliefs. The initiate went through an experience that simulated descent into the underworld. Elements of this ritual resemble Osiris&#x27;s merging with the sun in Egyptian funerary texts. Isis&#x27;s Greek and Roman devotees, like the Egyptians, believed that she protected the dead in the afterlife as she had done for Osiris, and they said that undergoing the initiation guaranteed to them a blessed afterlife. It was to a Greek priestess of Isis that Plutarch wrote his account of the myth of Osiris.

Through the work of classical writers such as Plutarch, knowledge of the Osiris myth was preserved even after the middle of the first millennium AD, when Egyptian religion ceased to exist and knowledge of the writing systems that were originally used to record the myth were lost. The myth remained a major part of Western impressions of ancient Egypt. In modern times, when understanding of Egyptian beliefs is informed by the original Egyptian sources, the story continues to influence and inspire new ideas, from works of fiction to scholarly speculation and new religious movements.

<text>Das Rheingold (; The Rhinegold), WWV 86A, is the first of the four epic music dramas that constitute Richard Wagner&#x27;s cycle &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; (English: &quot;The Ring of the Nibelung&quot;). It premiered as a single opera at the National Theatre of Munich on 22 September 1869, and received its first performance as part of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus on 13 August 1876.

Wagner wrote the &quot;Ring&quot; librettos in reverse order, so that &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; was the last of the texts to be written; it was, however, the first to be set to music. The score was completed in 1854, but Wagner was unwilling to sanction its performance until the whole cycle was complete; he worked intermittently on this music until 1874. The 1869 Munich premiere of &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; was staged, against Wagner&#x27;s wishes, on the orders of King Ludwig II of Bavaria, his patron. Following its 1876 Bayreuth premiere, the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle was introduced into the worldwide repertory, with performances in all the main opera houses, in which it has remained a regular and popular fixture.

In his 1851 essay &quot;Opera and Drama&quot;, Wagner had set out new principles as to how music dramas should be constructed, under which the conventional forms of opera (arias, ensembles, choruses) were rejected. Rather than providing word-settings, the music would interpret the text emotionally, reflecting the feelings and moods behind the work, by using a system of recurring leitmotifs to represent people, ideas and situations. &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; was Wagner&#x27;s first work that adopted these principles, and his most rigid adherence to them, despite a few deviations – the Rhinemaidens frequently sing in ensemble.

As the &quot;preliminary evening&quot; within the cycle, &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; gives the background to the events that drive the main dramas of the cycle. It recounts Alberich&#x27;s theft of the Rhine gold after his renunciation of love; his fashioning of the all-powerful ring from the gold and his enslavement of the Nibelungs; Wotan&#x27;s seizure of the gold and the ring, to pay his debt to the giants who have built his fortress Valhalla; Alberich&#x27;s curse on the ring and its possessors; Erda&#x27;s warning to Wotan to forsake the ring; the early manifestation of the curse&#x27;s power after Wotan yields the ring to the giants; and the gods&#x27; uneasy entry into Valhalla, under the shadow of their impending doom.

==Background and context==
Having completed his opera &quot;Lohengrin&quot; in April 1848, Richard Wagner chose as his next subject Siegfried, the legendary hero of Germanic myth. In October of that year he prepared a prose outline for &quot;Siegfried&#x27;s Death&quot;, which during the following months he developed into a full libretto. After his flight from Dresden and relocation in Switzerland, he continued to develop and expand his Siegfried project, having decided meantime that a single work would not suffice for his purposes; in his enlarged concept, &quot;Siegfried&#x27;s Death&quot; would be the culmination of a series of musical dramas incorporating a network of myths from his sources and imagination, each telling a stage of the story. In 1851 he outlined his purpose in his essay &quot;A Communication to My Friends&quot;: &quot;I propose to produce my myth in three complete dramas, preceded by a lengthy prelude (Vorspiel).&quot; Each of these dramas would, he said, constitute an independent whole, but would not be performed separately. &quot;At a specially-appointed Festival, I propose, some future time, to produce those three dramas with their prelude, in the course of three days and a fore-evening.

In accordance with this scheme, &quot;Siegfried&#x27;s Death&quot;, much revised from its original form, eventually became &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; (&quot;The Twilight of the Gods&quot;). It was preceded by the story of Siegfried&#x27;s youth, &quot;Young Siegfried&quot;, later renamed &quot;Siegfried&quot;, itself preceded by &quot;Die Walküre&quot; (&quot;The Valkyrie&quot;). Finally, to these three works Wagner added a prologue which he named &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;.

==Synopsis==

Prelude

===Scene 1===
At the bottom of the Rhine, the three Rhinemaidens, Woglinde, Wellgunde, and Floßhilde, play together. Alberich, a Nibelung dwarf, appears from a deep chasm and tries to woo them. The maidens mock his advances and he grows angry – he chases them, but they elude, tease and humiliate him. A sudden ray of sunshine pierces the depths, to reveal the Rhinegold. The maidens rejoice in the gold&#x27;s gleam. Alberich asks what it is. They explain that the gold, which their father has ordered them to guard, can be made into a magic ring which gives power to rule the world, if its bearer first renounces love. The maidens think they have nothing to fear from the lustful dwarf, but Alberich, embittered by their mockery, curses love, seizes the gold and returns to his chasm, leaving them screaming in dismay.

===Scene 2===
Wotan, ruler of the gods, is asleep on a mountaintop, with a magnificent castle behind him. His wife, Fricka, wakes Wotan, who salutes their new home. Fricka reminds him of his promise to the giants Fasolt and Fafner, who built the castle, that he would give them Fricka&#x27;s sister Freia, the goddess of youth and beauty, as payment. Fricka is worried for her sister, but Wotan trusts that Loge, the cunning demigod of fire, will find an alternative payment.

Freia enters in a panic, followed by Fasolt and Fafner. Fasolt demands that Freia be given up. He points out that Wotan&#x27;s authority is sustained by the treaties carved into his spear, including his contract with the giants, which Wotan therefore cannot violate. Donner, god of thunder, and Froh, god of sunshine, arrive to defend Freia, but Wotan cannot permit the use of force to break the agreement. Hoping that Loge will arrive with the alternative payment he has promised, Wotan tries to stall.

When Loge arrives, his initial report is discouraging: nothing is more valuable to men than love, so there is apparently no possible alternative payment besides Freia. Loge was able to find only one instance where someone willingly gave up love for something else: Alberich the Nibelung has renounced love, stolen the Rhine gold, and made a powerful magic ring out of it. A discussion of the ring and its powers ensues, and everyone finds good reasons for wanting to own it. Fafner makes a counter-offer: the giants will accept the Nibelung&#x27;s treasure in payment, instead of Freia. When Wotan tries to haggle, the giants depart, taking Freia with them as hostage and threatening to keep her forever unless the gods ransom her by obtaining and giving them the Nibelung&#x27;s gold by the end of the day.

Freia&#x27;s golden apples had kept the gods eternally young, but in her absence they begin to age and weaken. In order to redeem Freia, Wotan resolves to travel with Loge to Alberich&#x27;s subterranean kingdom to obtain the gold.

Orchestral interlude – Abstieg nach Nibelheim (&quot;Descent into Nibelheim&quot;)

===Scene 3===
In Nibelheim, Alberich has enslaved the rest of the Nibelung dwarves with the power of the ring. He has forced his brother Mime, a skillful smith, to create a magic helmet, the Tarnhelm. Alberich demonstrates the Tarnhelm&#x27;s power by making himself invisible to better torment his subjects.

Wotan and Loge arrive and happen upon Mime, who tells them of the dwarves&#x27; misery under Alberich&#x27;s rule. Alberich returns, driving his slaves to pile up a huge mound of gold. He boasts to the visitors about his plans to conquer the world using the power of the ring. Loge asks how he can protect himself against a thief while he sleeps. Alberich replies the Tarnhelm will hide him, by allowing him to turn invisible or change his form. Loge expresses doubt and requests a demonstration. Alberich complies by transforming himself into a giant snake; Loge acts suitably impressed, and then asks whether Alberich can also reduce his size, which would be very useful for hiding. Alberich transforms himself into a toad. Wotan and Loge seize him, tie his hands, and drag him up to the surface.

===Scene 4===
Back on the mountaintop, Wotan and Loge force Alberich to exchange his wealth for his freedom. He summons the Nibelungen, who bring up the hoard of gold. He then asks for the return of the Tarnhelm, but Loge says that it is part of his ransom. Alberich still hopes he can keep the ring, but Wotan demands it, and when Alberich refuses, Wotan tears it from Alberich&#x27;s hand and puts it on his own finger. Crushed by his loss, Alberich lays a curse on the ring: until it returns to him, it will inspire restless jealousy in those who own it, and murderous envy in those who do not, thus condemning all the possessors of the ring.

The gods reconvene. Fasolt and Fafner return with Freia. Fasolt, reluctant to release her, insists that the gold be piled high enough to hide her from view. Wotan is forced to relinquish the Tarnhelm, to help cover Freia completely. However, Fasolt spots a remaining crack in the gold, through which one of Freia&#x27;s eyes can be seen. Loge says that there is no more gold, but Fafner, who has noticed the ring on Wotan&#x27;s finger, demands that Wotan add it to the pile, to block the crack. Loge protests that the ring belongs to the Rheinmaidens, and Wotan angrily declares that he intends to keep it for his own. As the giants seize Freia and start to leave, Erda, the earth goddess, appears and warns Wotan of impending doom, urging him to give up the cursed ring. Troubled, Wotan calls the giants back and surrenders the ring. The giants release Freia and begin dividing the treasure, but they quarrel over the ring itself. Fafner clubs Fasolt to death. Wotan, horrified, realizes that Alberich&#x27;s curse has terrible power.

Donner summons a thunderstorm to clear the air, after which Froh creates a rainbow bridge that stretches to the gate of the castle. Wotan leads the gods across the bridge to the castle, which he names Valhalla. Loge does not follow; he says in an aside that he is tempted to destroy the complacent gods by fire – he will think it over. Far below, the Rhinemaidens mourn the loss of their gold and condemn the gods as false and cowardly.

== Writing history ==
===Text, sources, characters===
Because Wagner developed his &quot;Ring&quot; scheme in reverse chronological order, the &quot;poem&quot; (libretto) for &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; was the last of the four to be written. He finished his prose plan for the work in March 1852, and on 15 September began writing the full libretto, which he completed on 3 November. In February 1853, at the Hotel Baur au Lac in Zürich, Wagner read the whole &quot;Ring&quot; text to an invited audience, after which all four parts were published in a private edition limited to 50 copies. The text was not published commercially until 1863.

Of the principal sources that Wagner used in creating the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle, the Scandinavian Eddas – the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda – provided most of the material for &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;. These are poems and texts from 12th and 13th-century Iceland, which relate the doings of various Norse gods. Among these stories, a magic ring and a hoard of gold held by the dwarf Andvari (Wagner&#x27;s Alberich) are stolen by the gods Odin (Wotan) and Loki (Loge) and used to redeem a debt to two brothers. One of these, Fafnir, kills his brother and turns himself into a dragon to guard the gold. The Eddas also introduce the gods Thor (Donner), Frey (Froh) and the goddesses Frigg (Fricka) and Freyja (Freia). The idea of Erda, the earth mother, may have been derived from the character Jord (meaning &quot;Earth&quot;), who appears in the Eddas as the mother of Thor.

A few Rhinegold characters originate from outside the Eddas. Mime appears in the Thidriks saga, as a human smith rather than as an enslaved Nibelung. The three Rhinemaidens do not appear in any of the sagas and are substantially Wagner&#x27;s own invention; he also provided their individual names Woglinde, Wellgunde and Floßhilde. In his analysis of &quot;The Ring&quot; Deryck Cooke suggests the Rhinemaidens&#x27; origin may be in the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, where three water sprites tease the characters Hagen and Gunther. Wagner may also have been influenced by the Rhine-based German legend of Lorelei, who lures fishermen on to the rocks by her singing, and by the Greek Hesperides myth in which three maidens guard a golden treasure.

Robert Jacobs, in his biography of the composer, observes that the &quot;Nibelung Myth&quot; on which Wagner based his entire &quot;Ring&quot; story was &quot;very much a personal creation&quot;, the result of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;brilliant manipulation&quot; of his sources. In the &quot;Rheingold&quot; text, Wagner used his imaginative powers to adapt, change and distort the stories and characters from the sagas. J.K. Holman, in his &quot;Listener&#x27;s Guide and Concordance&quot; (2001), cites the Alberich character as typifying Wagner&#x27;s ability to &quot;consolidate selected aspects from diverse stories to create ... vivid, consistent and psychologically compelling portrait[s]&quot;. While some characters&#x27; importance is enhanced in Wagner&#x27;s version, others, such as Donner, Froh, and Freia, who are major figures in the sagas, are reduced by Wagner to roles of largely passive impotence.

Wagner originally conceived the first scene of &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; as a prologue to the three scenes that follow it. As such, the structure replicates that of &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;, and also that of the full &quot;Ring&quot; cycle.

===Composition===

As early as 1840, in his novella &quot;A Pilgrimage to Beethoven&quot;, Wagner had anticipated a form of lyric drama in which the standard operatic divisions would disappear. In early 1851 he published his book-length essay &quot;Opera and Drama&quot;, in which he expounded his emerging ideas around the concept of &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot; – &quot;total work of art&quot;. In the new kind of musical drama, he wrote, the traditional operatic norms of chorus, arias and vocal numbers would have no part. The vocal line would, in Gutman&#x27;s words, &quot;interpret the text emotionally through artificially calculated juxtapositions of rhythm, accent, pitch and key relationships&quot;. The orchestra, as well as providing the instrumental colour appropriate to each stage situation, would use a system of leitmotifs, each representing musically a person, an idea or a situation. Wagner termed these &quot;motifs of reminiscence and presentiment&quot;, which carry intense emotional experience through music rather than words. According to Jacobs, they should &quot;permeate the entire tissue of the music drama&quot;. The Rheingold score is structured around many such motifs; analysts have used different principles in determining the total number. Holman counts 42, while Roger Scruton, in his 2017 philosophical analysis of the &quot;Ring&quot;, numbers them at 53.

Apart from some early sketches in 1850, relating to &quot;Siegfried&#x27;s Death&quot;, Wagner composed the &quot;Ring&quot; music in its proper sequence. Thus, &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; was his first attempt to adopt the principles set out in &quot;Opera and Drama&quot;. According to his memoirs, Wagner&#x27;s first inspiration for the music came to him in a half-dream, on 4 September 1853, while he was in Spezia in Italy. He records a feeling of &quot;sinking in swiftly flowing water. The rushing sound formed itself in my brain into a musical sound, the chord of E flat major, which continually re-echoed in broken forms ... I at once recognised that the orchestral overture to the Rheingold, which must long have lain latent within me, though it had been unable to find definite form, had at last been revealed to me&quot;. Some authorities (for example Millington et al., 1992) have disputed the validity of this tale, which Nikolaus Bacht refers to as an &quot;acoustic hallucination&quot;.

After an extended tour, Wagner was back in Zürich by late October and began writing down the &quot;Rheingold&quot; music on 1 November. He finished the first draft in mid-January 1854, and by the end of May had completed the full orchestral score. According to Holman, the result was &quot;a stunning break from Wagner&#x27;s earlier musical output&quot; In the three years following his completion of the &quot;Rheingold&quot; score, Wagner wrote the music for &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, and for the first two acts of &quot;Siegfried&quot;. At that point, in 1857, he set &quot;Siegfried&quot; aside in order to work on &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, and did not return to the &quot;Ring&quot; project for 12 years.

==Performances==

===Premiere, Munich, 22 September 1869===
Long before &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; was ready for performance, Wagner conducted excerpts of the music from scenes 1, 2 and 4, at a concert in Vienna on 26 December 1862. The work remained unstaged, but by 1869 Wagner&#x27;s principal financial sponsor, King Ludwig of Bavaria, was pressing for an early performance in Munich. Wagner wanted to wait until the cycle was completed, when he would stage the work himself; also, his return to Munich would likely have precipitated a scandal, in view of his, at the time, affair with the married Cosima von Bülow. Wagner was horrified at the idea of his work being presented in accordance with Ludwig&#x27;s eccentric tastes. However, Ludwig, who possessed the copyright, was insistent that &quot;Rheingold&quot; be produced at the Munich Hofoper without further delay. Wagner did all he could to sabotage this production, fixed for August 1869, and persuaded the appointed conductor, Hans Richter to stand down after a troublesome dress rehearsal. Ludwig was unmoved; he denounced Wagner, sacked Richter, appointed another conductor, Franz Wüllner, and rescheduled the premiere for 22 September. Wagner was refused admission to the rehearsals at the theatre, and returned, angry and defeated, to his home in Tribschen.

Accounts differ as to the success or otherwise of the Munich premiere. Osborne maintains that the performance was successful, as does Holman, while Oliver Hilmes in his biography of Cosima describes it as &quot;an artistic disaster&quot;. Cosima&#x27;s diary entries for 24 and 27 September note that the performance was portrayed in the Munich press as a , or otherwise as &quot;a lavishly decorated, boring work&quot;. Gutman maintains that much of the adverse comment on the Munich premiere derives from later Bayreuth propaganda, and concludes that, &quot;in many ways, these Munich performances surpassed the level of the first Bayreuth festival&quot;. As to the public&#x27;s reaction, the audience&#x27;s main interest was in the novel scenery and stage effects; Wagner&#x27;s new approach to composition largely passed them by.

===Bayreuth premiere, 13 August 1876===

In 1876, with the Bayreuth Festspielhaus built, Wagner was ready to stage the first Bayreuth Festival with his own production of the now complete &quot;Ring&quot; cycle, beginning with a performance of &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; on 13 August. This event was preceded by months of preparation in which Wagner was deeply engaged; according to witnesses, he was &quot;director, producer, coach, conductor, singer, actor, stage manager, stage hand and prompter&quot;. He searched Europe for the finest orchestral players, and selected a largely new cast of singers – of the Munich cast, only Heinrich Vogl (Loge) was engaged, although Richter, deposed as conductor in Munich, was given the baton in Bayreuth.

The 13 August premiere was an event of international importance, and attracted a distinguished audience which included Kaiser Wilhelm I, Emperor Pedro II of Brazil and numerous representatives of the various European royal houses. King Ludwig, unwilling to face contact with his fellow-royals or the assembled crowd, attended the dress rehearsals incognito, but left Bayreuth before the opening night. Most of Europe&#x27;s leading composers were also present, including Tchaikovsky, Gounod, Bruckner, Grieg, Saint-Saëns and Wagner&#x27;s father-in law Franz Liszt, together with a large corps of music critics and opera house managers. The huge influx of visitors overwhelmed the resources of the modest-sized town and caused considerable discomfort to some of the most distinguished of the guests; Tchaikovsky later described his sojourn at Bayreuth as a &quot;struggle for existence&quot;. 

Despite the careful preparation, the first Bayreuth performance of &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; was punctuated by several mishaps. Some scene changes were mishandled; at one point a backdrop was prematurely lifted to reveal a number of stagehands and stage machinery; early in scene 4, Franz Betz (as Wotan) mislaid the ring and had to go backstage to look for it; the gas lighting failed repeatedly, plunging the auditorium into darkness. Some innovations worked well – the wheeled machinery used by the Rhinemaidens to simulate swimming was successful, and the quality of the singing pleased even Wagner, who was otherwise in despair and refused to present himself to the audience despite their clamouring for him. The critics made much of the technical shortcomings, which were largely overcome during the course of the festival, although, to Wagner&#x27;s fury, they failed to acknowledge this fact.

===Revivals===
====Traditional productions====

After the 1876 festival, &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; was not seen again at Bayreuth for 20 years, until Cosima revived the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle for the 1896 festival. Meanwhile, opera houses across Europe sought to mount their own productions, the first to do so being the Vienna State Opera, which staged &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; on 24 January 1878. In April 1878 &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; was produced in Leipzig, as part of the first full &quot;Ring&quot; cycle to be staged outside Bayreuth. London followed suit in May 1882, when &quot;Rheingold&quot; began a cycle at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Haymarket, under the baton of Anton Seidl. In the years following the London premiere, &quot;Ring&quot; cycles were staged in many European capitals. In Budapest on 26 January 1889, the first Hungarian performance of &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, conducted by the young Gustav Mahler, was briefly interrupted when the prompt-box caught fire and a number of patrons fled the theatre.

The American premiere of &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; was given by the New York Metropolitan Opera in January 1889, as a single opera, with Seidl conducting. The production used Carl Emil Doepler&#x27;s original Bayreuth costume designs, and scenery was imported from Germany. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;[t]he scenery, costumes and effects were all designed and executed with great art and caused admirable results.&quot; Of particular note was the performance of Joseph Beck who sang Alberich: &quot;a fine example of Wagnerian declamatory singing, His delivery of the famous curse of the ring was notably excellent in its distinctness and dramatic force&quot;. On 4 March 1889, with largely the January cast, Seidl conducted &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; to begin the first American &quot;Ring&quot; cycle. Thereafter, &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, either alone or as part of the &quot;Ring&quot;, became a regular feature of the international opera repertory, being seen in Saint Petersburg (1889), Paris (1901), Buenos Aires (1910), Melbourne (1913), and Rio de Janeiro (1921), as well many other major venues.

After the 1896 revival, &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; was being performed regularly at the Bayreuth Festival, although not every year, within a variety of &quot;Ring&quot; productions. Until the Second World War, under the successive artistic control of Cosima (from 1896 to 1907), her son Siegfried (1908 to 1930) and Siegfried&#x27;s widow Winifred (1931 to 1943), these productions did not deviate greatly from the stagings devised by Wagner for the 1876 premiere. With few exceptions, this generally conservative, even reverential approach – which extended to all Wagner&#x27;s operas – tended to be mirrored in performances outside Bayreuth.

====New Bayreuth and experimentation====
The Bayreuth Festival, suspended after the Second World War, resumed in 1951 under Wieland Wagner, Siegfried&#x27;s son, who introduced his first &quot;Ring&quot; cycle in the &quot;New Bayreuth&quot; style. This was the antithesis of all that had been seen at Bayreuth before, as scenery, costumes and traditional gestures were abandoned and replaced by a bare disc, with evocative lighting effects to signify changes of scene or mood. The stark New Bayreuth style dominated most &quot;Rheingold&quot; and &quot;Ring&quot; productions worldwide until the 1970s, when a reaction to its bleak austerity produced a number of fresh approaches. The Bayreuth centenary &quot;Ring&quot; production of 1976, directed by Patrice Chéreau provided a significant landmark in the history of Wagner stagings: &quot;Chéreau&#x27;s demythologization of the tetralogy entailed an anti-heroic view of the work ... his setting of the action in an industrialized society ... along with occasional 20th century costumes and props, suggested a continuity between Wagner&#x27;s time and our own&quot;. Many of this production&#x27;s features were highly controversial: the opening of &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; revealed a vast hydro-electric dam in which the gold is stored, guarded by the Rhinemaidens who were portrayed, in Spotts&#x27;s words, as &quot;three voluptuous tarts&quot; – a depiction, he says, which &quot;caused a shock from which no one quite recovered&quot;. According to &quot;The Observer&quot;″s critic, &quot;I had not experienced in the theatre protest as furious as that which greeted &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;.&quot; Eventually this hostility was overcome; the final performance of this production, in 1980, was followed by an ovation that lasted ninety minutes.

====Post-1980s====
The iconoclastic centenary &quot;Ring&quot; was followed by numerous original interpretations, at Bayreuth and elsewhere, in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The 1988 festival opened with Harry Kupfer&#x27;s grim interpretation of &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, in which Wotan and the other gods were represented as gangsters in mafioso sunglasses. This entire &quot;Ring&quot;, says Spotts, was &quot;a parable of how the power-hungry cheat, lie, bully, terrorise and kill to get what they want&quot;. In August Everding&#x27;s Chicago &quot;Reingold&quot; (which would become part of a full &quot;Ring&quot; cycle four years later), the Rhinemaidens were attached to elasticated ropes manipulated from the wings, which enabled them to cavort freely through the air, using lip sync to co-ordinate with off-stage singers. Edward Rothstein, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, found the production &quot;a puzzle ... cluttered with contraptions and conceits&quot; which, he imagined, were visual motifs which would be clarified in later operas. Keith Warner, in his 2004 production for Covent Garden, portrayed, according to Barry Millington&#x27;s analysis, &quot;the shift from a deistic universe to one controlled by human beings&quot;. The dangers of subverted scientific progress were demonstrated in the third &quot;Rheingold&quot; scene, where Nibelheim was represented as a medical chamber of horrors, replete with vivisections and &quot;unspeakable&quot; genetic experiments.

From the late 1980s a backlash against the tendency towards ever more outlandish interpretations of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle led to several new productions in the more traditional manner. Otto Schenk&#x27;s staging of &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, first seen at the New York Met in 1987 and forming the prelude to his full &quot;Ring&quot; cycle two years later, was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;charmingly old fashioned&quot;, and as &quot;a relief to many beleaguered Wagnerites&quot;. James Morris, who sang Wotan in the 1987 production, and James Levine, the original conductor, both returned in 2009 when Schenk brought his &quot;Ring&quot; cycle back to the Met for a final performance.

==Music==
&quot;Das Rheingold&quot; was Wagner&#x27;s first attempt to write dramatic music in accordance with the principles he had enunciated in &quot;Opera and Drama&quot;, hence the general absence in the score of conventional operatic &quot;numbers&quot; in the form of arias, ensembles and choruses. Rather than acting as the accompanist to the voices, the orchestra combines with them on equal terms to propel the drama forward. According to Barry Millington&#x27;s analysis, &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; represents Wagner&#x27;s purest application of the &quot;Opera and Drama&quot; principles, a rigorous stance that he would eventually modify. Even in &quot;Rheingold&quot;, as Jacobs indicates, Wagner was flexible when the dramatic occasion warranted it; thus, the Rhinemaidens sing in the disavowed ensembles, and there are several instances in which characters sing melodies that appear to be musically independent from the general flow. The music is continuous, with instrumental entr&#x27;actes linking the actions of the four discrete scenes.

===Prelude===
The prelude to &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; consists of an extended (136-bar) chord in E major, which begins almost inaudibly in the lowest register of eight double-basses. The note of B is added by the bassoons and the chord is further embellished as the horns enter with a rising arpeggio to announce the &quot;Nature&quot; motif, outlining the lower partials of an harmonic series with an E fundamental. This is further elaborated in the strings; the lower-register instruments sustain the E note throughout the prelude, while the chord is increasingly enhanced by the orchestra. The &quot;Rhine&quot; motif emerges, representing what Osborne describes as &quot;the calm, majestic course of the river&#x27;s character The composer Robert Erickson describes the prelude as drone music – &quot;the only well-known drone piece in the concert repertory&quot;. Millington suggests that the protracted chord does not simply represent the depths of the Rhine, rather &quot;the birth of the world, the act of creation itself&quot;.

===First scene===
When the prelude reaches its climax the curtain rises and the key shifts to A as Woglinde sings a &quot;greeting to the waters&quot;. The first two and last two notes of this short, lilting passage form a falling musical step which, in different guises, will recur throughout the opera, signifying variously the Rhinemaidens&#x27; innocence, their joy in the gold and conversely, in the minor key, Alberich&#x27;s woe at his rejection by the maidens, and his enslavement of the Nibelungs. The first appearance of the gold is signified by a muted horn call in the lower register, played under a shimmer of undulating strings, conveying, says Holman, &quot;the shining, innocent beauty of the Rhinegold in its unfashioned state.&quot; The motif for the ring itself first appears in the woodwind, as Wellgunde reveals that a ring fashioned from the gold would confer on its owner the power to win the wealth of the world. This is followed by what is sometimes known as the &quot;renunciation&quot; motif, when Woglinde sings that to fashion such a ring, the owner must first renounce love. Confusion arises because this same motif is used later in the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle to represent affirmation rather than rejection of love; Roger Scruton suggests the motif would be more appropriately labelled &quot;existential choice&quot;. Alberich duly curses love, seizes the gold and departs, to the sounds of the despairing shrieks of the Rhinemaidens.

===Second scene===

During the first entr&#x27;acte, the Ring motif is transformed into the multipart and oft-reiterated &quot;Valhalla&quot; music – four intertwined motifs which represent the majesty of the gods and the extent of Wotan&#x27;s power. Scene two begins on the mountaintop, in sight of the newly completed castle, where Fricka and Wotan bicker over Wotan&#x27;s contract with the giants. This duologue is characterised by Fricka&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s longing&quot; motif, in which she sighs for a home that will satisfy Wotan and halt his infidelities. Freia&#x27;s distressed entrance is illustrated by &quot;Love&quot;, a fragment that will recur and develop as the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle unfolds. The Giants&#x27; entrance is signified by heavy, stamping music that reflects both their simple nature and their brute strength. The &quot;Golden Apples&quot; motif, of &quot;remarkable beauty&quot; according to Scruton, is sung by Fafner as a threatening reminder to the gods that the loss of Freia means the loss of their youth and vigour; it is later used by Loge to mock the gods for their weakness after Freia&#x27;s departure with the giants. The &quot;Spear&quot; motif, a rapidly descending scale, represents the moral basis of Wotan&#x27;s power and the sanctity of the treaties engraved on it. The phrase of five descending notes known as &quot;Woman&#x27;s Worth&quot;, first sung by Loge, is described by Holman as one of the most pervasive and appealing motifs in the entire &quot;Ring&quot; cycle – he lists 43 occurrences of the motif throughout the cycle. Many of the &quot;Ring&quot;″s characters – Wotan, Froh, Alberich, Fasolt and Erda in &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; – either sing this phrase or are orchestrally referenced by it.

===Third scene===
The descent of Wotan and Loge into Nibelheim is represented musically in the second entr&#x27;acte, which begins with the &quot;renunciation&quot; and &quot;spear&quot; motifs but is quickly overwhelmed with the insistent, rhythmic 9/8 beat of the Nibelung motif in B, briefly foreshadowed in Loge&#x27;s scene 2 soliloquy. In the climax to the entr&#x27;acte this rhythm is hammered out on eighteen anvils. This motif is thereafter used, not just to represent the Nibelungs but also their enslavement in a state of relentless misery. During the scene&#x27;s opening interaction between Alberich and Mime, the soft, mysterious &quot;Tarnhelm&quot; motif is heard on muted horns; this is later combined with the &quot;serpent&quot; motif as, at Loge&#x27;s behest, Alberich uses the Tarnhelm to transform himself into a giant snake. The transition back to the mountaintop, following Alberich&#x27;s entrapment, references a number of motifs, among them Alberich&#x27;s woe, the ring, renunciation and the Nibelungs&#x27; enslavement.

===Fourth scene===
After Wotan seizes the ring from the captive Alberich, the dwarf&#x27;s agonised, self-pitying monologue (&quot;Am I now free?&quot;) ends with his declamation of the &quot;Curse&quot; motif – &quot;one of the most sinister musical ideas ever to have entered the operatic repertoire&quot;, according to Scruton&#x27;s analysis: &quot;It rises through a half-diminished chord, and then falls through an octave to settle on a murky C major triad, with clarinets in their lowest register over a timpani pedal in F sharp&quot;. This motif will recur throughout the cycle; it will be heard later in this scene, when Fafner clubs Fasolt to death over possession of the ring. Tranquil, ascending harmonies introduce the reconvention of the gods and giants. The subsequent dispute over Wotan&#x27;s reluctance to part with the ring ends with Erda&#x27;s appearance; her motif is a minor-key variation of the &quot;Nature&quot; motif from the prelude. After her warning she departs to the sounds of the &quot;Downfall&quot; motif, an inversion of Erda&#x27;s entry that resembles &quot;Woman&#x27;s Worth&quot;. The scene ends with a rapid succession of motifs: &quot;Donner&#x27;s Call&quot;, a horn fanfare by which he summons the thunderstorm; Froh&#x27;s &quot;Rainbow Bridge&quot; which provides a path for the gods into Valhalla; the &quot;Sword&quot; motif, a C major arpeggio that will become highly significant in later &quot;Ring&quot; operas, and the haunting &quot;Rhinemaidens&#x27; Lament&quot;, developed from the falling step which earlier signified the maidens&#x27; joy in the gold. Scruton writes of this lament: &quot;And yet, ever sounding in the depths, is the lament of the Rhine-daughters, singing of a natural order that preceded the conscious will that has usurped it. This lament sounds in the unconsciousness of us all, as we pursue our paths to personality, sovereignty and freedom...&quot;. These are the last voices that are heard in the opera, &quot;piercing our hearts with sudden longing, melting our bones with nostalgic desire&quot;, before the gods, &quot;marching in empty triumph to their doom&quot;, enter Valhalla to a thunderous orchestral conclusion, made up from several motifs including &quot;Valhalla&quot;, &quot;Rainbow Bridge&quot; and the &quot;Sword&quot;.

===Orchestral forces===
&quot;Das Rheingold&quot; is scored for the following instrumental forces:

*    Woodwind: Piccolo; 3 flutes; 3 oboes; cor anglais; 3 clarinets; bass clarinet; 3 bassoons
*    Brass: 8 horns (5-8 doubling Wagner Tubas in Bb and F); 3 trumpets; bass trumpet; 2 tenor trombones; bass trombone; contrabass trombone (doubling bass trombone); contrabass tuba
*    Percussion: 2 sets of timpani; cymbals; triangle; gong
*    Strings: 16 first violins; 16 second violins; 12 violas; 12 cellos; 8 double basses; 6 harps (plus a seventh off-stage)
*    Off-stage: 18 anvils of varying sizes (tuned to 3 octaves of F#); hammer

==Critical assessment==
Although it is sometimes performed independently, &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; is not generally considered outside the structure of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle. However, as Millington points out, it is a substantial work in its own right, and has several characteristics not shared by the other works in the tetralogy. It is comparatively short, with continuous music; no interludes or breaks. The action moves forward relatively swiftly, unencumbered, as Arnold Whittall observes, by the &quot;retarding explanations&quot; – pauses in the action to clarify the context of what is going on – that permeate the later, much longer works. Its lack of the conventional operatic devices (arias, choruses, ensembles) further enable the story to progress briskly.

Since it was written as a prelude to the main events, &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; is in itself inconclusive, leaving numerous loose ends to be picked up later; its function, as Jacobs says, is &quot;to expound, not to draw conclusions&quot;. The fact that most of its characters display decidedly human emotions makes it seem, according to a recent writer, &quot;much more a present-day drama than a remote fable&quot;. Nevertheless, Philip Kennicott, writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; describes it as &quot;the hardest of the four installments to love, with its family squabbles, extensive exposition, and the odd, hybrid world Wagner creates, not always comfortably balanced between the mythic and the recognizably human.&quot; Certain presumptions are challenged or overturned; John Louis Gaetani, in a 2006 essay, notes that, in Loge&#x27;s view, the gods are far more culpable than the Nibelungs, and that Wotan, for all his prestige as the ruler of the gods, &quot;does much more evil than Alberich ever dreams of&quot;.

==Recording==

Live performances of &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; from Bayreuth and elsewhere were recorded from 1937 onwards, but were not issued for many years. The first studio recording, and the first to be issued commercially, was Georg Solti&#x27;s 1958 Decca version, part of his complete &quot;Ring&quot; cycle, 1958–1966, which marked the beginning of a new era in recorded opera. Since then &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; has been recorded, as part of the cycle, on many occasions, with regular new issues.

<text>In mathematics, a divisor of an integer formula_1 also called a factor of formula_1 is an integer formula_3 that may be multiplied by some integer to produce formula_4 In this case, one also says that formula_5 is a &quot;multiple&quot; of formula_6 An integer formula_5 is divisible or evenly divisible by another integer formula_3 if formula_3 is a divisor of formula_5; this implies dividing formula_5 by formula_3 leaves no remainder.

== Definition ==
An integer formula_5 is divisible by a nonzero integer formula_3 if there exists an integer formula_15 such that formula_16 This is written as
: formula_17
This may be read as that formula_3 divides formula_1 formula_3 is a divisor of formula_1 formula_3 is a factor of formula_1 or formula_5 is a multiple of formula_6 If formula_3 does not divide formula_1 then the notation is formula_28

There are two conventions, distinguished by whether formula_3 is permitted to be zero:
* With the convention without an additional constraint on formula_30 formula_31 for every integer formula_6
* With the convention that formula_3 be nonzero, formula_31 for every nonzero integer formula_6

== General ==
Divisors can be negative as well as positive, although often the term is restricted to positive divisors. For example, there are six divisors of 4; they are 1, 2, 4, −1, −2, and −4, but only the positive ones (1, 2, and 4) would usually be mentioned.

1 and −1 divide (are divisors of) every integer. Every integer (and its negation) is a divisor of itself. Integers divisible by 2 are called even, and integers not divisible by 2 are called odd.

1, −1, formula_5 and formula_37 are known as the trivial divisors of formula_4 A divisor of formula_5 that is not a trivial divisor is known as a non-trivial divisor (or strict divisor). A nonzero integer with at least one non-trivial divisor is known as a composite number, while the units −1 and 1 and prime numbers have no non-trivial divisors.

There are divisibility rules that allow one to recognize certain divisors of a number from the number&#x27;s digits.

== Examples ==

* 7 is a divisor of 42 because formula_40 so we can say formula_41 It can also be said that 42 is divisible by 7, 42 is a multiple of 7, 7 divides 42, or 7 is a factor of 42.
* The non-trivial divisors of 6 are 2, −2, 3, −3.
* The positive divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.
* The set of all positive divisors of 60, formula_42 partially ordered by divisibility, has the Hasse diagram:

== Further notions and facts ==
There are some elementary rules:
* If formula_43 and formula_44 then formula_45 that is, divisibility is a transitive relation.
* If formula_43 and formula_47 then formula_48 or formula_49 (That is, formula_50 and formula_51 are associates.)
* If formula_43 and formula_53 then formula_54 holds, as does formula_55 However, if formula_43 and formula_57 then formula_58 does &quot;not&quot; always hold (for example, formula_59 and formula_60 but 5 does not divide 6).
* formula_61 for nonzero formula_62. This follows immediately from writing formula_63.

If formula_64 and formula_65 then formula_66 This is called Euclid&#x27;s lemma.

If formula_67 is a prime number and formula_68 then formula_69 or formula_70

A positive divisor of formula_5 that is different from formula_5 is called a &#x27; or an &#x27; of formula_5 (for example, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3). A number that does not evenly divide formula_5 but leaves a remainder is sometimes called an of formula_4

An integer formula_76 whose only proper divisor is 1 is called a prime number. Equivalently, a prime number is a positive integer that has exactly two positive factors: 1 and itself.

Any positive divisor of formula_5 is a product of prime divisors of formula_5 raised to some power. This is a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

A number formula_5 is said to be perfect if it equals the sum of its proper divisors, deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than formula_1 and abundant if this sum exceeds formula_4

The total number of positive divisors of formula_5 is a multiplicative function formula_83 meaning that when two numbers formula_3 and formula_5 are relatively prime, then formula_86 For instance, formula_87; the eight divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21 and 42. However, the number of positive divisors is not a totally multiplicative function: if the two numbers formula_3 and formula_5 share a common divisor, then it might not be true that formula_86 The sum of the positive divisors of formula_5 is another multiplicative function formula_92 (for example, formula_93). Both of these functions are examples of divisor functions.

If the prime factorization of formula_5 is given by
: formula_95
then the number of positive divisors of formula_5 is
: formula_97
and each of the divisors has the form
: formula_98
where formula_99 for each formula_100

For every natural formula_1 formula_102

Also,
: formula_103
where formula_104 is Euler–Mascheroni constant.
One interpretation of this result is that a randomly chosen positive integer &quot;n&quot; has an average
number of divisors of about formula_105 However, this is a result from the contributions of numbers with &quot;abnormally many&quot; divisors.

== In abstract algebra ==
=== Ring theory ===
=== Division lattice ===

In definitions that allow the divisor to be 0, the relation of divisibility turns the set formula_106 of non-negative integers into a partially ordered set that is a complete distributive lattice. The largest element of this lattice is 0 and the smallest is 1. The meet operation ∧ is given by the greatest common divisor and the join operation ∨ by the least common multiple. This lattice is isomorphic to the dual of the lattice of subgroups of the infinite cyclic group Z.

<text>In mathematics, Pascal&#x27;s triangle is an infinite triangular array of the binomial coefficients which play a crucial role in probability theory, combinatorics, and algebra. In much of the Western world, it is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, although other mathematicians studied it centuries before him in Persia, India, China, Germany, and Italy.

The rows of Pascal&#x27;s triangle are conventionally enumerated starting with row formula_1 at the top (the 0th row). The entries in each row are numbered from the left beginning with formula_2 and are usually staggered relative to the numbers in the adjacent rows. The triangle may be constructed in the following manner: In row 0 (the topmost row), there is a unique nonzero entry 1. Each entry of each subsequent row is constructed by adding the number above and to the left with the number above and to the right, treating blank entries as 0. For example, the initial number of row 1 (or any other row) is 1 (the sum of 0 and 1), whereas the numbers 1 and 3 in row 3 are added to produce the number 4 in row 4.

== Formula ==
In the formula_3th row of Pascal&#x27;s triangle, the formula_4th entry is denoted formula_5, pronounced &quot; choose &quot;. For example, the topmost entry is formula_6. With this notation, the construction of the previous paragraph may be written as
formula_7
for any positive integer formula_3 and any integer formula_9. This recurrence for the binomial coefficients is known as Pascal&#x27;s rule.

== History ==

The pattern of numbers that forms Pascal&#x27;s triangle was known well before Pascal&#x27;s time. The Persian mathematician Al-Karaji (953–1029) wrote a now-lost book which contained the first description of Pascal&#x27;s triangle. In India, the &quot;Chandaḥśāstra&quot; by the Indian poet and mathematician Piṅgala (3rd or 2nd century BC) somewhat cryptically describes a method of arranging two types of syllables to form metres of various lengths and counting them; as interpreted and elaborated by Piṅgala&#x27;s 10th-century commentator Halāyudha his &quot;method of pyramidal expansion&quot; (&quot;meru-prastāra&quot;) for counting metres is equivalent to Pascal&#x27;s triangle. It was later repeated by Omar Khayyám (1048–1131), another Persian mathematician; thus the triangle is also referred to as Khayyam&#x27;s triangle () in Iran. Several theorems related to the triangle were known, including the binomial theorem. Khayyam used a method of finding &quot;n&quot;th roots based on the binomial expansion, and therefore on the binomial coefficients.

Pascal&#x27;s triangle was known in China during the 11th century through the work of the Chinese mathematician Jia Xian (1010–1070). During the 13th century, Yang Hui (1238–1298) defined the triangle, and it is known as Yang Hui&#x27;s triangle () in China.

In Europe, Pascal&#x27;s triangle appeared for the first time in the &quot;Arithmetic&quot; of Jordanus de Nemore (13th century).
The binomial coefficients were calculated by Gersonides during the early 14th century, using the multiplicative formula for them. Petrus Apianus (1495–1552) published the full triangle on the frontispiece of his book on business calculations in 1527. Michael Stifel published a portion of the triangle (from the second to the middle column in each row) in 1544, describing it as a table of figurate numbers. In Italy, Pascal&#x27;s triangle is referred to as Tartaglia&#x27;s triangle, named for the Italian algebraist Tartaglia (1500–1577), who published six rows of the triangle in 1556. Gerolamo Cardano also published the triangle as well as the additive and multiplicative rules for constructing it in 1570.

Pascal&#x27;s (&quot;Treatise on Arithmetical Triangle&quot;) was published posthumously in 1665. In this, Pascal collected several results then known about the triangle, and employed them to solve problems in probability theory. The triangle was later named for Pascal by Pierre Raymond de Montmort (1708) who called it (French: Mr. Pascal&#x27;s table for combinations) and Abraham de Moivre (1730) who called it (Latin: Pascal&#x27;s Arithmetic Triangle), which became the basis of the modern Western name.

== Binomial expansions ==
Pascal&#x27;s triangle determines the coefficients which arise in binomial expansions. For example, in the expansion
formula_10
the coefficients are the entries in the second row of Pascal&#x27;s triangle: formula_11, formula_12, formula_13.

In general, the binomial theorem states that when a binomial like formula_14 is raised to a positive integer power formula_3, the expression expands as
formula_16
where the coefficients formula_17 are precisely the numbers in row formula_18 of Pascal&#x27;s triangle:
formula_19

The entire left diagonal of Pascal&#x27;s triangle corresponds to the coefficient of formula_20 in these binomial expansions, while the next left diagonal corresponds to the coefficient of formula_21, and so on.

To see how the binomial theorem relates to the simple construction of Pascal&#x27;s triangle, consider the problem of calculating the coefficients of the expansion of formula_22 in terms of the corresponding coefficients of formula_23, where we set formula_24 for simplicity. Suppose then that
formula_25
Now
formula_26

The two summations can be reindexed with formula_27 and combined to yield
formula_28

Thus the extreme left and right coefficients remain as 1, and for any given formula_29, the coefficient of the formula_30 term in the polynomial formula_31 is equal to formula_32, the sum of the formula_33 and formula_30 coefficients in the previous power formula_35. This is indeed the downward-addition rule for constructing Pascal&#x27;s triangle.

It is not difficult to turn this argument into a proof (by mathematical induction) of the binomial theorem. 

Since formula_36, the coefficients are identical in the expansion of the general case.

An interesting consequence of the binomial theorem is obtained by setting both variables formula_37, so that
formula_38

In other words, the sum of the entries in the formula_3th row of Pascal&#x27;s triangle is the formula_3th power of 2. This is equivalent to the statement that the number of subsets of an formula_3-element set is formula_42, as can be seen by observing that each of the formula_3 elements may be independently included or excluded from a given subset.

== Combinations ==
A second useful application of Pascal&#x27;s triangle is in the calculation of combinations. The number of combinations of formula_3 items taken formula_4 at a time, i.e. the number of subsets of formula_4 elements from among formula_3 elements, can be found by the equation

:formula_48.

This is equal to entry formula_4 in row formula_3 of Pascal&#x27;s triangle. Rather than performing the multiplicative calculation, one can simply look up the appropriate entry in the triangle (constructed by additions). For example, suppose 3 workers need to be hired from among 7 candidates; then the number of possible hiring choices is 7 choose 3, the entry 3 in row 7 of the above table (taking into consideration the first row is the 0th row), which is formula_51.

== Relation to binomial distribution and convolutions ==
When divided by formula_52, the formula_53th row of Pascal&#x27;s triangle becomes the binomial distribution in the symmetric case where formula_54. By the central limit theorem, this distribution approaches the normal distribution as formula_53 increases. This can also be seen by applying Stirling&#x27;s formula to the factorials involved in the formula for combinations.

This is related to the operation of discrete convolution in two ways. First, polynomial multiplication corresponds exactly to discrete convolution, so that repeatedly convolving the sequence formula_56 with itself corresponds to taking powers of formula_57, and hence to generating the rows of the triangle. Second, repeatedly convolving the distribution function for a random variable with itself corresponds to calculating the distribution function for a sum of &quot;n&quot; independent copies of that variable; this is exactly the situation to which the central limit theorem applies, and hence results in the normal distribution in the limit. (The operation of repeatedly taking a convolution of something with itself is called the convolution power.)

== Patterns and properties ==
Pascal&#x27;s triangle has many properties and contains many patterns of numbers.

=== Rows ===
* The sum of the elements of a single row is twice the sum of the row preceding it. For example, row 0 (the topmost row) has a value of 1, row 1 has a value of 2, row 2 has a value of 4, and so forth. This is because every item in a row produces two items in the next row: one left and one right. The sum of the elements of row formula_53 equals to formula_52.
*Taking the product of the elements in each row, the sequence of products is related to the base of the natural logarithm, &quot;e&quot;. Specifically, define the sequence formula_60 for all formula_61 as follows: formula_62 Then, the ratio of successive row products is formula_63 and the ratio of these ratios is formula_64 The right-hand side of the above equation takes the form of the limit definition of formula_65 formula_66.
* formula_67 can be found in Pascal&#x27;s triangle by use of the Nilakantha infinite series. formula_68
* Some of the numbers in Pascal&#x27;s triangle correlate to numbers in Lozanić&#x27;s triangle.
* The sum of the squares of the elements of row  equals the middle element of row . For example, . In general form, formula_69
* In any even row formula_70, the middle term minus the term two spots to the left equals a Catalan number, specifically formula_71. For example, in row 4, which is 1, 4, 6, 4, 1, we get the 3rd Catalan number formula_72.
* In a row , where is a prime number, all the terms in that row except the 1s are divisible by . This can be proven easily, from the multiplicative formula formula_73. Since the denominator formula_74 can have no prime factors equal to , so remains in the numerator after integer division, making the entire entry a multiple of .
* &quot;Parity&quot;: To count odd terms in row , convert to binary. Let be the number of 1s in the binary representation. Then the number of odd terms will be . These numbers are the values in Gould&#x27;s sequence.
* Every entry in row 2&quot;n&quot; − 1, &quot;n&quot; ≥ 0, is odd.
*&quot;Polarity&quot;: When the elements of a row of Pascal&#x27;s triangle are alternately added and subtracted together, the result is 0. For example, row 6 is 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1, so the formula is 1 − 6 + 15 − 20 + 15 − 6 + 1 = 0.

=== Diagonals ===

The diagonals of Pascal&#x27;s triangle contain the figurate numbers of simplices:
* The diagonals going along the left and right edges contain only 1&#x27;s.
* The diagonals next to the edge diagonals contain the natural numbers in order. The 1-dimensional simplex numbers increment by 1 as the line segments extend to the next whole number along the number line.
* Moving inwards, the next pair of diagonals contain the triangular numbers in order.
* The next pair of diagonals contain the tetrahedral numbers in order, and the next pair give pentatope numbers.

::formula_75

The symmetry of the triangle implies that the &quot;n&quot;th d-dimensional number is equal to the &quot;d&quot;th &quot;n&quot;-dimensional number.

An alternative formula that does not involve recursion is
formula_76
where &quot;n&quot;(&quot;d&quot;) is the rising factorial.

The geometric meaning of a function &quot;P&quot;&quot;d&quot; is: &quot;P&quot;&quot;d&quot;(1) = 1 for all &quot;d&quot;. Construct a &quot;d&quot;-dimensional triangle (a 3-dimensional triangle is a tetrahedron) by placing additional dots below an initial dot, corresponding to &quot;P&quot;&quot;d&quot;(1) = 1. Place these dots in a manner analogous to the placement of numbers in Pascal&#x27;s triangle. To find P&quot;d&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), have a total of &quot;x&quot; dots composing the target shape. P&quot;d&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) then equals the total number of dots in the shape. A 0-dimensional triangle is a point and a 1-dimensional triangle is simply a line, and therefore &quot;P&quot;0(&quot;x&quot;) = 1 and &quot;P&quot;1(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;, which is the sequence of natural numbers. The number of dots in each layer corresponds to &quot;P&quot;&quot;d&quot; − 1(&quot;x&quot;).

=== Calculating a row or diagonal by itself ===
There are simple algorithms to compute all the elements in a row or diagonal without computing other elements or factorials.

To compute row formula_3 with the elements formula_78, begin with formula_79. For each subsequent element, the value is determined by multiplying the previous value by a fraction with slowly changing numerator and denominator:

:formula_80

For example, to calculate row 5, the fractions are  formula_81,  formula_82,  formula_83,  formula_84 and formula_85, and hence the elements are  formula_86,   formula_87,   formula_88, etc. (The remaining elements are most easily obtained by symmetry.)

To compute the diagonal containing the elements formula_89 begin again with formula_90 and obtain subsequent elements by multiplication by certain fractions:

:formula_91

For example, to calculate the diagonal beginning at formula_92, the fractions are  formula_93, and the elements are formula_94, etc. By symmetry, these elements are equal to formula_95, etc.

=== Overall patterns and properties ===

* The pattern obtained by coloring only the odd numbers in Pascal&#x27;s triangle closely resembles the fractal known as the Sierpiński triangle. This resemblance becomes increasingly accurate as more rows are considered; in the limit, as the number of rows approaches infinity, the resulting pattern &quot;is&quot; the Sierpiński triangle, assuming a fixed perimeter. More generally, numbers could be colored differently according to whether or not they are multiples of 3, 4, etc.; this results in other similar patterns.
:As the proportion of black numbers tends to zero with increasing &quot;n&quot;, a corollary is that the proportion of odd binomial coefficients tends to zero as &quot;n&quot; tends to infinity.


Pascal&#x27;s triangle overlaid on a grid gives the number of distinct paths to each square, assuming only rightward and downward steps to an adjacent square are considered.
* In a triangular portion of a grid (as in the images below), the number of shortest grid paths from a given node to the top node of the triangle is the corresponding entry in Pascal&#x27;s triangle. On a Plinko game board shaped like a triangle, this distribution should give the probabilities of winning the various prizes.

* If the rows of Pascal&#x27;s triangle are left-justified, the diagonal bands (colour-coded below) sum to the Fibonacci numbers.

=== Construction as matrix exponential ===
 &amp;= \text{binomial}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Due to its simple construction by factorials, a very basic representation of Pascal&#x27;s triangle in terms of the matrix exponential can be given: Pascal&#x27;s triangle is the exponential of the matrix which has the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, ... on its sub-diagonal and zero everywhere else.

===Construction of Clifford algebra using simplices===
Labelling the elements of each n-simplex matches the basis elements of Clifford algebra used as forms in Geometric Algebra rather than matrices. Recognising the geometric operations, such as rotations, allows the algebra operations to be discovered. Just as each row, , starting at 0, of Pascal&#x27;s triangle corresponds to an -simplex, as described below, it also defines the number of named basis forms in dimensional Geometric algebra. The binomial theorem can be used to prove the geometric relationship provided by Pascal&#x27;s triangle. This same proof could be applied to simplices except that the first column of all 1&#x27;s must be ignored whereas in the algebra these correspond to the real numbers, formula_96, with basis 1.

=== Relation to geometry of polytopes ===

Each row of Pascal&#x27;s triangle gives the number of elements (such as edges and corners) of each dimension in a corresponding simplex (such as a triangle or tetrahedron). In particular, for , the th entry in the th row is the number of -dimensional elements in a -dimensional simplex. For example, a triangle (the 2-dimensional simplex) one 2-dimensional element (itself), three 1-dimensional elements (lines, or edges), and three 0-dimensional elements (vertices, or corners); this corresponds to the third row 1, 3, 3, 1 of Pascal&#x27;s triangle. This fact can be explained by combining Pascal&#x27;s rule for generating the triangle with the geometric construction of simplices: each simplex is formed from a simplex of one lower dimension by the addition of a new vertex, outside the space in which the lower-dimensional simplex lies. Then each -dimensional element in the smaller simplex remains a -dimensional element of the higher simplex, and each -dimensional element when joined to the new vertex forms a new -dimensional element of the higher simplex.

A similar pattern is observed relating to squares, as opposed to triangles. To find the pattern, one must construct an analog to Pascal&#x27;s triangle, whose entries are the coefficients of , instead of . There are a couple ways to do this. The simpler is to begin with row 0 = 1 and row 1 = 1, 2. Proceed to construct the analog triangles according to the following rule:

:formula_97

That is, choose a pair of numbers according to the rules of Pascal&#x27;s triangle, but double the one on the left before adding. This results in:
:formula_98
The other way of producing this triangle is to start with Pascal&#x27;s triangle and multiply each entry by 2k, where k is the position in the row of the given number. For example, the 2nd value in row 4 of Pascal&#x27;s triangle is 6 (the slope of 1s corresponds to the zeroth entry in each row). To get the value that resides in the corresponding position in the analog triangle, multiply 6 by . Now that the analog triangle has been constructed, the number of elements of any dimension that compose an arbitrarily dimensioned cube (called a hypercube) can be read from the table in a way analogous to Pascal&#x27;s triangle. For example, the number of 2-dimensional elements in a 2-dimensional cube (a square) is one, the number of 1-dimensional elements (sides, or lines) is 4, and the number of 0-dimensional elements (points, or vertices) is 4. This matches the 2nd row of the table (1, 4, 4). A cube has 1 cube, 6 faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices, which corresponds to the next line of the analog triangle (1, 6, 12, 8). This pattern continues indefinitely.

To understand why this pattern exists, first recognize that the construction of an &quot;n&quot;-cube from an -cube is done by simply duplicating the original figure and displacing it some distance (for a regular &quot;n&quot;-cube, the edge length) orthogonal to the space of the original figure, then connecting each vertex of the new figure to its corresponding vertex of the original. This initial duplication process is the reason why, to enumerate the dimensional elements of an &quot;n&quot;-cube, one must double the first of a pair of numbers in a row of this analog of Pascal&#x27;s triangle before summing to yield the number below. The initial doubling thus yields the number of &quot;original&quot; elements to be found in the next higher &quot;n&quot;-cube and, as before, new elements are built upon those of one fewer dimension (edges upon vertices, faces upon edges, etc.). Again, the last number of a row represents the number of new vertices to be added to generate the next higher &quot;n&quot;-cube.

In this triangle, the sum of the elements of row &quot;m&quot; is equal to 3&quot;m&quot;. Again, to use the elements of row 4 as an example: , which is equal to formula_99.

==== Counting vertices in a cube by distance ====
Each row of Pascal&#x27;s triangle gives the number of vertices at each distance from a fixed vertex in an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional cube. For example, in three dimensions, the third row (1 3 3 1) corresponds to the usual three-dimensional cube: fixing a vertex &quot;V&quot;, there is one vertex at distance 0 from &quot;V&quot; (that is, &quot;V&quot; itself), three vertices at distance 1, three vertices at distance and one vertex at distance (the vertex opposite &quot;V&quot;). The second row corresponds to a square, while larger-numbered rows correspond to hypercubes in each dimension.

=== Fourier transform of sin(&quot;x&quot;)&quot;n&quot;+1/&quot;x&quot; ===

As stated previously, the coefficients of (&quot;x&quot; + 1)&quot;n&quot; are the nth row of the triangle. Now the coefficients of (&quot;x&quot; − 1)&quot;n&quot; are the same, except that the sign alternates from +1 to −1 and back again. After suitable normalization, the same pattern of numbers occurs in the Fourier transform of sin(&quot;x&quot;)&quot;n&quot;+1/&quot;x&quot;. More precisely: if &quot;n&quot; is even, take the real part of the transform, and if &quot;n&quot; is odd, take the imaginary part. Then the result is a step function, whose values (suitably normalized) are given by the &quot;n&quot;th row of the triangle with alternating signs. For example, the values of the step function that results from:

:formula_100

compose the 4th row of the triangle, with alternating signs. This is a generalization of the following basic result (often used in electrical engineering):

:formula_101

is the boxcar function. The corresponding row of the triangle is row 0, which consists of just the number 1.

If n is congruent to 2 or to 3 mod 4, then the signs start with −1. In fact, the sequence of the (normalized) first terms corresponds to the powers of i, which cycle around the intersection of the axes with the unit circle in the complex plane: formula_102

== Extensions ==

Pascal&#x27;s triangle may be extended upwards, above the 1 at the apex, preserving the additive property, but there is more than one way to do so.

=== To higher dimensions ===
Pascal&#x27;s triangle has higher dimensional generalizations. The three-dimensional version is known as &quot;Pascal&#x27;s pyramid&quot; or &quot;Pascal&#x27;s tetrahedron&quot;, while the general versions are known as &quot;Pascal&#x27;s simplices&quot;.

=== To complex numbers ===

When the factorial function is defined as formula_103, Pascal&#x27;s triangle can be extended beyond the integers to formula_104, since formula_105 is meromorphic to the entire complex plane.

=== To arbitrary bases ===
Isaac Newton once observed that the first five rows of Pascal&#x27;s triangle, when read as the digits of an integer, are the corresponding powers of eleven. He claimed without proof that subsequent rows also generate powers of eleven. In 1964, Robert L. Morton presented the more generalized argument that each row formula_3 can be read as a radix formula_107 numeral, where formula_108 is the hypothetical terminal row, or limit, of the triangle, and the rows are its partial products. He proved the entries of row formula_3, when interpreted directly as a place-value numeral, correspond to the binomial expansion of formula_110. More rigorous proofs have since been developed. To better understand the principle behind this interpretation, here are some things to recall about binomials:
* A radix formula_107 numeral in positional notation (e.g. formula_112) is a univariate polynomial in the variable formula_107, where the degree of the variable of the formula_114th term (starting with formula_115) is formula_114. For example, formula_117.
* A row corresponds to the binomial expansion of formula_118. The variable formula_119 can be eliminated from the expansion by setting formula_120. The expansion now typifies the expanded form of a radix formula_107 numeral, as demonstrated above. Thus, when the entries of the row are concatenated and read in radix formula_107 they form the numerical equivalent of formula_123. If formula_124 for formula_125, then the theorem holds for formula_126 with odd values of formula_3 yielding negative row products.

By setting the row&#x27;s radix (the variable formula_107) equal to one and ten, row formula_3 becomes the product formula_130 and formula_131, respectively. To illustrate, consider formula_132, which yields the row product formula_133. The numeric representation of formula_134 is formed by concatenating the entries of row formula_3. The twelfth row denotes the product:

: formula_136

with compound digits (delimited by &quot;:&quot;) in radix twelve. The digits from formula_137 through formula_138 are compound because these row entries compute to values greater than or equal to twelve. To normalize the numeral, simply carry the first compound entry&#x27;s prefix, that is, remove the prefix of the coefficient formula_139 from its leftmost digit up to, but excluding, its rightmost digit, and use radix-twelve arithmetic to sum the removed prefix with the entry on its immediate left, then repeat this process, proceeding leftward, until the leftmost entry is reached. In this particular example, the normalized string ends with formula_140 for all formula_3. The leftmost digit is formula_142 for formula_143, which is obtained by carrying the formula_144 of formula_145 at entry formula_138. It follows that the length of the normalized value of formula_134 is equal to the row length, formula_148. The integral part of formula_149 contains exactly one digit because formula_3 (the number of places to the left the decimal has moved) is one less than the row length. Below is the normalized value of formula_151. Compound digits remain in the value because they are radix formula_152 residues represented in radix ten: 

: formula_153

<text>Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a type of mass spectrometry that uses an inductively coupled plasma to ionize the sample. It atomizes the sample and creates atomic and small polyatomic ions, which are then detected. It is known and used for its ability to detect metals and several non-metals in liquid samples at very low concentrations. It can detect different isotopes of the same element, which makes it a versatile tool in isotopic labeling.

Compared to atomic absorption spectroscopy, ICP-MS has greater speed, precision, and sensitivity. However, compared with other types of mass spectrometry, such as thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) and glow discharge mass spectrometry (GD-MS), ICP-MS introduces many interfering species: argon from the plasma, component gases of air that leak through the cone orifices, and contamination from glassware and the cones.

==Components==

===Inductively coupled plasma===

An inductively coupled plasma is a plasma that is energized (ionized) by inductively heating the gas with an electromagnetic coil, and contains a sufficient concentration of ions and electrons to make the gas electrically conductive. Not all of the gas needs to be ionized for the gas to have the characteristics of a plasma; as little as 1% ionization creates a plasma. The plasmas used in spectrochemical analysis are essentially electrically neutral, with each positive charge on an ion balanced by a free electron. In these plasmas the positive ions are almost all singly charged and there are few negative ions, so there are nearly equal numbers of ions and electrons in each unit volume of plasma.

The ICPs have two operation modes, called capacitive (E) mode with low plasma density and inductive (H) mode with high plasma density, and E to H heating mode transition occurs with external inputs. The Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry is operated in the H mode.

What makes Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) unique to other forms of inorganic mass spectrometry is its ability to sample the analyte continuously, without interruption. This is in contrast to other forms of inorganic mass spectrometry; Glow Discharge Mass Spectrometry (GDMS) and Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry (TIMS), that require a two-stage process: Insert sample(s) into a vacuum chamber, seal the vacuum chamber, pump down the vacuum, energize sample, thereby sending ions into the mass analyzer. With ICP-MS the sample to be analyzed is sitting at atmospheric pressure. Through the effective use of differential pumping; multiple vacuum stages separate by differential apertures (holes), the ions created in the argon plasma are, with the aid of various electrostatic focusing techniques, transmitted through the mass analyzer to the detector(s) and counted. Not only does this enable the analyst to radically increase sample throughput (amount of samples over time), but has also made it possible to do what is called &quot;time resolved acquisition&quot;. Hyphenated techniques like Liquid Chromatography ICP-MS (LC-ICP-MS); Laser Ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS); Flow Injection ICP-MS (FIA-ICP-MS), etc. have benefited from this relatively new technology. It has stimulated the development new tools for research including geochemistry and forensic chemistry; biochemistry and oceanography. Additionally, increases in sample throughput from dozens of samples a day to hundreds of samples a day have revolutionized environmental analysis, reducing costs. Fundamentally, this is all due to the fact that while the sample resides at environmental pressure, the analyzer and detector are at 1/10,000,000 of that same pressure during normal operation.

An inductively coupled plasma (ICP) for spectrometry is sustained in a torch that consists of three concentric tubes, usually made of quartz, although the inner tube (injector) can be sapphire if hydrofluoric acid is being used. The end of this torch is placed inside an induction coil supplied with a radio-frequency electric current. A flow of argon gas (usually 13 to 18 liters per minute) is introduced between the two outermost tubes of the torch and an electric spark is applied for a short time to introduce free electrons into the gas stream. These electrons interact with the radio-frequency magnetic field of the induction coil and are accelerated first in one direction, then the other, as the field changes at high frequency (usually 27.12 million cycles per second). The accelerated electrons collide with argon atoms, and sometimes a collision causes an argon atom to part with one of its electrons. The released electron is in turn accelerated by the rapidly changing magnetic field. The process continues until the rate of release of new electrons in collisions is balanced by the rate of recombination of electrons with argon ions (atoms that have lost an electron). This produces a ‘fireball’ that consists mostly of argon atoms with a rather small fraction of free electrons and argon ions. The temperature of the plasma is very high, of the order of 10,000 K. The plasma also produces ultraviolet light, so for safety should not be viewed directly.

The ICP can be retained in the quartz torch because the flow of gas between the two outermost tubes keeps the plasma away from the walls of the torch. A second flow of argon (around 1 liter per minute) is usually introduced between the central tube and the intermediate tube to keep the plasma away from the end of the central tube. A third flow (again usually around 1 liter per minute) of gas is introduced into the central tube of the torch. This gas flow passes through the centre of the plasma, where it forms a channel that is cooler than the surrounding plasma but still much hotter than a chemical flame. Samples to be analyzed are introduced into this central channel, usually as a mist of liquid formed by passing the liquid sample into a nebulizer.

To maximise plasma temperature (and hence ionisation efficiency) and stability, the sample should be introduced through the central tube with as little liquid (solvent load) as possible, and with consistent droplet sizes. A nebuliser can be used for liquid samples, followed by a spray chamber to remove larger droplets, or a desolvating nebuliser can be used to evaporate most of the solvent before it reaches the torch. Solid samples can also be introduced using laser ablation. The sample enters the central channel of the ICP, evaporates, molecules break apart, and then the constituent atoms ionise. At the temperatures prevailing in the plasma a significant proportion of the atoms of many chemical elements are ionized, each atom losing its most loosely bound electron to form a singly charged ion. The plasma temperature is selected to maximise ionisation efficiency for elements with a high first ionisation energy, while minimising second ionisation (double charging) for elements that have a low second ionisation energy.

===Mass spectrometry===

For coupling to mass spectrometry, the ions from the plasma are extracted through a series of cones into a mass spectrometer, usually a quadrupole. The ions are separated on the basis of their mass-to-charge ratio and a detector receives an ion signal proportional to the concentration.

The concentration of a sample can be determined through calibration with certified reference material such as single or multi-element reference standards. ICP-MS also lends itself to quantitative determinations through isotope dilution, a single point method based on an isotopically enriched standard. In order to increase reproducibility and compensate for errors by sensitivity variation, an internal standard can be added.

Other mass analyzers coupled to ICP systems include double focusing magnetic-electrostatic sector systems with both single and multiple collector, as well as time of flight systems (both axial and orthogonal accelerators have been used).

==Applications==
One of the largest volume uses for ICP-MS is in the medical and forensic field, specifically, toxicology. A physician may order a metal assay for a number of reasons, such as suspicion of heavy metal poisoning, metabolic concerns, and even hepatological issues. Depending on the specific parameters unique to each patient&#x27;s diagnostic plan, samples collected for analysis can range from whole blood, urine, plasma, serum, to even packed red blood cells. Another primary use for this instrument lies in the environmental field. Such applications include water testing for municipalities or private individuals all the way to soil, water and other material analysis for industrial purposes.

In recent years, industrial and biological monitoring has presented another major need for metal analysis via ICP-MS. Individuals working in factories where exposure to metals is likely and unavoidable, such as a battery factory, are required by their employer to have their blood or urine analyzed for metal toxicity on a regular basis. This monitoring has become a mandatory practice implemented by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, in an effort to protect workers from their work environment and ensure proper rotation of work duties (i.e. rotating employees from a high exposure position to a low exposure position).

ICP-MS is also used widely in the geochemistry field for radiometric dating, in which it is used to analyze relative abundance of different isotopes, in particular uranium and lead. ICP-MS is more suitable for this application than the previously used thermal ionization mass spectrometry, as species with high ionization energy such as osmium and tungsten can be easily ionized. For high precision ratio work, multiple collector instruments are normally used to reduce the effect noise on the calculated ratios.

In the field of flow cytometry, a new technique uses ICP-MS to replace the traditional fluorochromes. Briefly, instead of labelling antibodies (or other biological probes) with fluorochromes, each antibody is labelled with a distinct combinations of lanthanides. When the sample of interest is analysed by ICP-MS in a specialised flow cytometer, each antibody can be identified and quantitated by virtue of a distinct ICP &quot;footprint&quot;. In theory, hundreds of different biological probes can thus be analysed in an individual cell, at a rate of ca. 1,000 cells per second. Because elements are easily distinguished in ICP-MS, the problem of compensation in multiplex flow cytometry is effectively eliminated.

Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is a powerful technique for the elemental analysis of a wide variety of materials encountered in forensic casework. (LA-ICP-MS) has already successfully been applied to applications in forensics, metals, glasses, soils, car paints, bones and teeth, printing inks, trace elemental, fingerprint, and paper. Among these, forensic glass analysis stands out as an application for which this technique has great utility to provide highly.
Car hit and runs, burglaries, assaults, drive-by shootings and bombings such as these situations may cause glass fragments that could be used as evidence of association in glass transfer conditions. LA-ICP-MS is considered one of the best techniques for analysis of glass due to the short time for sample preparation and sample, small sample size of less than 250 nanograms. In addition there is no need for complex procedure and handling of dangerous materials that is used for digestion of the samples. This allows detecting major, minor and tracing elements with high level of precision and accuracy. There are set of properties that are used to measure glass sample such as physical and optical properties including color, thickness, density, refractive index (RI) and also, if necessary, elemental analysis can be conducted in order to enhance the value of an association.

=== Pharmaceutical industry ===
In the pharmaceutical industry, ICP-MS is used for detecting inorganic impurities in pharmaceuticals and their ingredients. New and reduced maximum permitted exposure levels of heavy metals from dietary supplements, introduced in USP (United States Pharmacopeia) «&quot;〈232〉Elemental Impurities—Limits&quot;» and USP «&quot;〈232〉Elemental Impurities—Procedures&quot;», will increase the need for ICP-MS technology, where, previously, other analytic methods have been sufficient.

Cosmetics, such as lipstick, recovered from a crime scene may provide valuable forensic information. Lipstick smears left on cigarette butts, glassware, clothing, bedding; napkins, paper, etc. may be valuable evidence. Lipstick recovered from clothing or skin may also indicate physical contact between individuals. Forensic analysis of recovered lipstick smear evidence can provide valuable information on the recent activities of a victim or suspect. Trace elemental analysis of lipstick smears could be used to complement existing visual comparative procedures to determine the lipstick brand and color.

Single Particle Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (SP ICP-MS) was designed for particle suspensions in 2000 by Claude Degueldre. He first tested this new methodology at the Forel Institute of the University of Geneva and presented this new analytical approach at the &#x27;Colloid 2oo2&#x27; symposium during the spring 2002 meeting of the EMRS, and in the proceedings in 2003. This study presents the theory of SP ICP-MS and the results of tests carried out on clay particles (montmorillonite) as well as other suspensions of colloids. This method was then tested on thorium dioxide nanoparticles by Degueldre &amp; Favarger (2004), zirconium dioxide by Degueldre &quot;et al&quot; (2004) and gold nanoparticles, which are used as a substrate in nanopharmacy, and published by Degueldre &quot;et al&quot; (2006). Subsequently, the study of uranium dioxide nano- and micro-particles gave rise to a detailed publication, Ref. Degueldre &quot;et al&quot; (2006). Since 2010 the interest for SP ICP-MS has exploded.
Previous forensic techniques employed for the organic analysis of lipsticks by compositional comparison include thin layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography (GC), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These methods provide useful information regarding the identification of lipsticks. However, they all require long sample preparation times and destroy the sample. Nondestructive techniques for the forensic analysis of lipstick smears include UV fluorescence observation combined with purge-and-trap gas chromatography, microspectrophotometry and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and Raman spectroscopy.

===Metal speciation===
A growing trend in the world of elemental analysis has revolved around the speciation, or determination of oxidation state of certain metals such as chromium and arsenic. The toxicity of those elements varies with the oxidation state, so new regulations from food authorities requires speciation of some elements. One of the primary techniques to achieve this is to separate the chemical species with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or field flow fractionation (FFF) and then measure the concentrations with ICP-MS.

===Quantification of proteins and biomolecules===
There is an increasing trend of using ICP-MS as a tool in speciation analysis, which normally involves a front end chromatograph separation and an elemental selective detector, such as AAS and ICP-MS. For example, ICP-MS may be combined with size exclusion chromatography and preparative native PAGE for identifying and quantifying metalloproteins in biofluids. Also the phosphorylation status of proteins can be analyzed.

In 2007, a new type of protein tagging reagents called metal-coded affinity tags (MeCAT) were introduced to label proteins quantitatively with metals, especially lanthanides. The MeCAT labelling allows relative and absolute quantification of all kind of proteins or other biomolecules like peptides. MeCAT comprises a site-specific biomolecule tagging group with at least a strong chelate group which binds metals. The MeCAT labelled proteins can be accurately quantified by ICP-MS down to low attomol amount of analyte which is at least 2–3 orders of magnitude more sensitive than other mass spectrometry based quantification methods. By introducing several MeCAT labels to a biomolecule and further optimization of LC-ICP-MS detection limits in the zeptomol range are within the realm of possibility. By using different lanthanides MeCAT multiplexing can be used for pharmacokinetics of proteins and peptides or the analysis of the differential expression of proteins (proteomics) e.g. in biological fluids. Breakable PAGE SDS-PAGE (DPAGE, dissolvable PAGE), two-dimensional gel electrophoresis or chromatography is used for separation of MeCAT labelled proteins. Flow-injection ICP-MS analysis of protein bands or spots from DPAGE SDS-PAGE gels can be easily performed by dissolving the DPAGE gel after electrophoresis and staining of the gel. MeCAT labelled proteins are identified and relatively quantified on peptide level by MALDI-MS or ESI-MS.

===Elemental analysis===
The ICP-MS allows determination of elements with atomic mass ranges 7 to 250 (Li to U), and sometimes higher. Some masses are prohibited, such as 40 Da, due to the abundance of argon in the sample. Other interference regions may include mass 80 (due to the argon dimer) and mass 56 (due to ArO), the latter of which greatly hinders Fe detection unless the instrument is fitted with a reaction chamber. Such interferences can be reduced by using a high resolution ICP-MS (HR-ICP-MS) which uses two or more slits to constrict the beam and distinguish between nearby peaks. This comes at the cost of sensitivity. For example, distinguishing iron from argon requires a resolving power of about 10,000, which may reduce the iron sensitivity by around 99%. Interfering species can alternatively be distinguished through the use of a collision chamber, which can filter gasses by either chemical reaction or physical collision. 

A single collector ICP-MS may use a multiplier in pulse counting mode to amplify very low signals, an attenuation grid or a multiplier in analogue mode to detect medium signals, and a Faraday cup/bucket to detect larger signals. A multi-collector ICP-MS may have more than one of any of these, typically Faraday buckets which are more cost-effective than other collectors. With this combination, a dynamic range of 12 orders of magnitude, from 1 part per quadrillion (ppq) to 100 parts per million (ppm) is possible.

ICP-MS is a common method for the determination of cadmium in biological samples.

Unlike atomic absorption spectroscopy, which can only measure a single element at a time, ICP-MS has the capability to scan for all elements simultaneously. This allows rapid sample processing. A simultaneous ICP-MS that can record the entire analytical spectrum from lithium to uranium in every analysis won the Silver Award at the 2010 Pittcon Editors&#x27; Awards. An ICP-MS may use multiple scan modes, each one striking a different balance between speed and precision. Using the magnet alone to scan is slow due to hysteresis but is precise. Electrostatic plates can be used in addition to the magnet to increase the speed, and with multiple collectors can allow a scan of every element from Lithium 6 to Uranium Oxide 256 in less than a quarter of a second. For low detection limits, interfering species and high precision, the counting time can increase substantially. The rapid scanning, large dynamic range and large mass range of ICP-MS is ideally suited to measuring multiple unknown concentrations and isotope ratios in samples that have had minimal preparation (an advantage over TIMS). The analysis of seawater, urine, and digested whole rock samples are examples of industry applications. These properties also lend well to laser-ablated rock samples, where the scanning rate is fast enough to enable a real-time plot of any number of isotopes. This also allows easy spatial mapping of mineral grains.

==Hardware==
In terms of input and output, ICP-MS instrument consumes prepared sample material and translates it into mass-spectral data. Actual analytical procedure takes some time; after that time the instrument can be switched to work on the next sample. Series of such sample measurements requires the instrument to have plasma ignited, meanwhile a number of technical parameters has to be stable in order for the results obtained to have feasibly accurate and precise interpretation. Maintaining the plasma requires a constant supply of carrier gas (usually, pure argon) and increased power consumption of the instrument. When these additional running costs are not considered justified, plasma and most of auxiliary systems can be turned off. In such standby mode only pumps are working to keep proper vacuum in mass-spectrometer.

The constituents of ICP-MS instrument are designed to allow for reproducible and/or stable operation.

===Sample introduction===
The first step in analysis is the introduction of the sample. This has been achieved in ICP-MS through a variety of means.

The most common method is the use of &quot;analytical nebulizers.&quot; A nebulizer converts liquids into an aerosol, and that aerosol can then be swept into the plasma to create the ions. Nebulizers work best with simple liquid samples (i.e. solutions). However, there have been instances of their use with more complex materials like a slurry. Many varieties of nebulizers have been coupled to ICP-MS, including pneumatic, cross-flow, Babington, ultrasonic, and desolvating types. The aerosol generated is often treated to limit it to only smallest droplets, commonly by means of a Peltier cooled double pass or cyclonic spray chamber. Use of autosamplers makes this easier and faster, especially for routine work and large numbers of samples. A Desolvating Nebuliser (DSN) may also be used; this uses a long heated capillary, coated with a fluoropolymer membrane, to remove most of the solvent and reduce the load on the plasma. Matrix removal introduction systems are sometimes used for samples, such as seawater, where the species of interest are at trace levels, and are surrounded by much more abundant contaminants.

Laser ablation is another method. Though less common in the past, it has become popular as a means of sample introduction, thanks to increased ICP-MS scanning speeds. In this method, a pulsed UV laser is focused on the sample and creates a plume of ablated material, which can be swept into the plasma. This allows geochemists to spatially map the isotope composition in cross-sections of rock samples, a tool which is lost if the rock is digested and introduced as a liquid sample. Lasers for this task are built to have highly controllable power outputs and uniform radial power distributions, to produce craters which are flat bottomed and of a chosen diameter and depth.

For both Laser Ablation and Desolvating Nebulisers, a small flow of nitrogen may also be introduced into the argon flow. Nitrogen exists as a dimer, so has more vibrational modes and is more efficient at receiving energy from the RF coil around the torch.

Other methods of sample introduction are also utilized. Electrothermal vaporization (ETV) and in torch vaporization (ITV) use hot surfaces (graphite or metal, generally) to vaporize samples for introduction. These can use very small amounts of liquids, solids, or slurries. Other methods like vapor generation are also known.

===Plasma torch===
The plasma used in an ICP-MS is made by partially ionizing argon gas (Ar → Ar+ + e−). The energy required for this reaction is obtained by pulsing an alternating electric current in load coil that surrounds the plasma torch with a flow of argon gas.

After the sample is injected, the plasma&#x27;s extreme temperature causes the sample to separate into individual atoms (atomization). Next, the plasma ionizes these atoms (M → M+ + e−) so that they can be detected by the mass spectrometer.

An inductively coupled plasma (ICP) for spectrometry is sustained in a torch that consists of three concentric tubes, usually made of quartz. The two major designs are the Fassel and Greenfield torches. The end of this torch is placed inside an induction coil supplied with a radio-frequency electric current. A flow of argon gas (usually 14 to 18 liters per minute) is introduced between the two outermost tubes of the torch and an electrical spark is applied for a short time to introduce free electrons into the gas stream. These electrons interact with the radio-frequency magnetic field of the induction coil and are accelerated first in one direction, then the other, as the field changes at high frequency (usually 27.12 MHz or 40 MHz). The accelerated electrons collide with argon atoms, and sometimes a collision causes an argon atom to part with one of its electrons. The released electron is in turn accelerated by the rapidly changing magnetic field. The process continues until the rate of release of new electrons in collisions is balanced by the rate of recombination of electrons with argon ions (atoms that have lost an electron). This produces a ‘fireball’ that consists mostly of argon atoms with a rather small fraction of free electrons and argon ions.

====Advantage of argon====
Making the plasma from argon, instead of other gases, has several advantages. First, argon is abundant (in the atmosphere, as a result of the radioactive decay of potassium) and therefore cheaper than other noble gases. Argon also has a higher first ionization potential than all other elements except He, F, and Ne. Because of this high ionization energy, the reaction (Ar+ + e− → Ar) is more energetically favorable than the reaction (M+ + e− → M). This ensures that the sample remains ionized (as M+) so that the mass spectrometer can detect it.

Argon can be purchased for use with the ICP-MS in either a refrigerated liquid or a gas form. However it is important to note that whichever form of argon purchased, it should have a guaranteed purity of 99.9% Argon at a minimum. It is important to determine which type of argon will be best suited for the specific situation. Liquid argon is typically cheaper and can be stored in a greater quantity as opposed to the gas form, which is more expensive and takes up more tank space. If the instrument is in an environment where it gets infrequent use, then buying argon in the gas state will be most appropriate as it will be more than enough to suit smaller run times and gas in the cylinder will remain stable for longer periods of time, whereas liquid argon will suffer loss to the environment due to venting of the tank when stored over extended time frames. However, if the ICP-MS is to be used routinely and is on and running for eight or more hours each day for several days a week, then going with liquid argon will be the most suitable. If there are to be multiple ICP-MS instruments running for long periods of time, then it will most likely be beneficial for the laboratory to install a bulk or micro bulk argon tank which will be maintained by a gas supply company, thus eliminating the need to change out tanks frequently as well as minimizing loss of argon that is left over in each used tank as well as down time for tank changeover.

Helium can be used either in place of, or mixed with, argon for plasma generation. Helium&#x27;s higher first ionisation energy allows greater ionisation and therefore higher sensitivity for hard-to-ionise elements. The use of pure helium also avoids argon-based interferences such as ArO. However, many of the interferences can be mitigated by use of a collision cell, and the greater cost of helium has prevented its use in commercial ICP-MS.

===Transfer of ions into vacuum===
The carrier gas is sent through the central channel and into the very hot plasma. The sample is then exposed to radio frequency which converts the gas into a plasma. The high temperature of the plasma is sufficient to cause a very large portion of the sample to form ions. This fraction of ionization can approach 100% for some elements (e.g. sodium), but this is dependent on the ionization potential. A fraction of the formed ions passes through a ~1 mm hole (sampler cone) and then a ~0.4 mm hole (skimmer cone). The purpose of which is to allow a vacuum that is required by the mass spectrometer.

The vacuum is created and maintained by a series of pumps. The first stage is usually based on a roughing pump, most commonly a standard rotary vane pump. This removes most of the gas and typically reaches a pressure of around 133 Pa. Later stages have their vacuum generated by more powerful vacuum systems, most often turbomolecular pumps. Older instruments may have used oil diffusion pumps for high vacuum regions.

===Ion optics===

Before mass separation, a beam of positive ions has to be extracted from the plasma and focused into the mass-analyzer. It is important to separate the ions from UV photons, energetic neutrals and from any solid particles that may have been carried into the instrument from the ICP. Traditionally, ICP-MS instruments have used transmitting ion lens arrangements for this purpose. Examples include the Einzel lens, the Barrel lens, Agilent&#x27;s Omega Lens and Perkin-Elmer&#x27;s Shadow Stop. Another approach is to use ion guides (quadrupoles, hexapoles, or octopoles) to guide the ions into mass analyzer along a path away from the trajectory of photons or neutral particles. Yet another approach is Varian patented used by Analytik Jena ICP-MS 90 degrees reflecting parabolic &quot;Ion Mirror&quot; optics, which are claimed to provide more efficient ion transport into the mass-analyzer, resulting in better sensitivity and reduced background. Analytik Jena ICP-MS PQMS is the most sensitive instrument on the market.

A sector ICP-MS will commonly have four sections: an extraction acceleration region, steering lenses, an electrostatic sector and a magnetic sector. The first region takes ions from the plasma and accelerates them using a high voltage. The second uses may use a combination of parallel plates, rings, quadrupoles, hexapoles and octopoles to steer, shape and focus the beam so that the resulting peaks are symmetrical, flat topped and have high transmission. The electrostatic sector may be before or after the magnetic sector depending on the particular instrument, and reduces the spread in kinetic energy caused by the plasma. This spread is particularly large for ICP-MS, being larger than Glow Discharge and much larger than TIMS. The geometry of the instrument is chosen so that the instrument the combined focal point of the electrostatic and magnetic sectors is at the collector, known as Double Focusing (or Double Focussing).

If the mass of interest has a low sensitivity and is just below a much larger peak, the low mass tail from this larger peak can intrude onto the mass of interest. A Retardation Filter might be used to reduce this tail. This sits near the collector, and applies a voltage equal but opposite to the accelerating voltage; any ions that have lost energy while flying around the instrument will be decelerated to rest by the filter.

===Collision reaction cell and iCRC===

The collision/reaction cell is used to remove interfering ions through ion/neutral reactions. Collision/reaction cells are known under several names. The dynamic reaction cell is located before the quadrupole in the ICP-MS device. The chamber has a quadrupole and can be filled with reaction (or collision) gases (ammonia, methane, oxygen or hydrogen), with one gas type at a time or a mixture of two of them, which reacts with the introduced sample, eliminating some of the interference.

The integrated Collisional Reaction Cell (iCRC) used by Analytik Jena ICP-MS is a mini-collision cell installed in front of the parabolic ion mirror optics that removes interfering ions by injecting a collisional gas (He), or a reactive gas (H2), or a mixture of the two, directly into the plasma as it flows through the skimmer cone and/or the sampler cone. The iCRC removed interfering ions using a collisional kinetic energy discrimination (KED) phenomenon and chemical reactions with interfering ions similarly to traditionally used larger collision cells.

==Routine maintenance==
As with any piece of instrumentation or equipment, there are many aspects of maintenance that need to be encompassed by daily, weekly and annual procedures. The frequency of maintenance is typically determined by the sample volume and cumulative run time that the instrument is subjected to.

One of the first things that should be carried out before the calibration of the ICP-MS is a sensitivity check and optimization. This ensures that the operator is aware of any possible issues with the instrument and if so, may address them before beginning a calibration. Typical indicators of sensitivity are Rhodium levels, Cerium/Oxide ratios and DI water blanks. One common standard practice is to measure a standard tuning solution provided by the ICP manufacturer every time the plasma torch is started. Then the instrument is auto-calibrated for optimum sensitivity and the operator obtains a report providing certain parameters such as sensitivity, mass resolution and estimated amount of oxidized species and double-positive charged species.

One of the most frequent forms of routine maintenance is replacing sample and waste tubing on the peristaltic pump, as these tubes can get worn fairly quickly resulting in holes and clogs in the sample line, resulting in skewed results. Other parts that will need regular cleaning and/or replacing are sample tips, nebulizer tips, sample cones, skimmer cones, injector tubes, torches and lenses. It may also be necessary to change the oil in the interface roughing pump as well as the vacuum backing pump, depending on the workload put on the instrument.

==Sample preparation==
For most clinical methods using ICP-MS, there is a relatively simple and quick sample prep process. The main component to the sample is an internal standard, which also serves as the diluent. This internal standard consists primarily of deionized water, with nitric or hydrochloric acid and indium and/or gallium. The addition of volatile acids allows for the sample to decompose into its gaseous components in the plasma which minimizes the ability for concentrated salts and solvent loads to clog the cones and contaminate the instrument. Depending on the sample type, usually 5 mL of the internal standard is added to a test tube along with 10–500 microliters of sample. This mixture is then vortexed for several seconds or until mixed well and then loaded onto the autosampler tray. For other applications that may involve very viscous samples or samples that have particulate matter, a process known as sample digestion may have to be carried out before it can be pipetted and analyzed. This adds an extra first step to the above process and therefore makes the sample prep more lengthy.

<text>&#x27; (; The Valkyrie&quot;&quot;&#x27;), WWV 86B, is the second of the four epic music dramas that constitute Richard Wagner&#x27;s cycle &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; (English: &quot;The Ring of the Nibelung&quot;). It was performed, as a single opera, at the National Theatre Munich on 26 June 1870, and received its first performance as part of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus on 14 August 1876.

As the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle was conceived by Wagner in reverse order of performance, &quot;Die Walküre&quot; was the third of the four texts to be written, although Wagner composed the music in performance sequence. The text was completed by July 1852, and the music by March 1856. 

Wagner largely followed the principles related to the form of musical drama, which he had set out in his 1851 essay &quot;Opera and Drama&quot; under which the music would interpret the text emotionally, reflecting the feelings and moods behind the work, using a system of recurring leitmotifs to represent people, ideas, and situations rather than the conventional operatic units of arias, ensembles, and choruses. Wagner showed flexibility in the application of these principles here, particularly in Act III, when the Valkyries engage in frequent ensemble singing.

As with &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, Wagner wished to defer any performance of the new work until it could be shown in the context of the completed cycle, but the 1870 Munich premiere was arranged at the insistence of his patron, King Ludwig II of Bavaria. &quot;Die Walküre&quot; has achieved some popularity as a stand-alone work and continues to be performed independently from its role in the tetralogy.

The story of &quot;Die Walküre&quot; is based on the Norse mythology told in the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; and the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. In this version, the Volsung twins Sieglinde and Siegmund, separated in childhood, meet and fall in love. This union angers the gods, who demand that Siegmund must die. Sieglinde and the couple&#x27;s unborn child are saved by the defiant actions of Wotan&#x27;s daughter, the title character, Valkyrie Brünnhilde, who as a result faces the gods&#x27; retribution.

==Background and context==
Wagner began work on what became his &quot;Ring&quot; project in October 1848, when he prepared a prose outline for &quot;Siegfried&#x27;s Death&quot;, based on the legendary hero of Germanic myth. During the following months, he developed the outline into a full &quot;poem&quot; or libretto.

After his travels to Switzerland in May 1849, Wagner continued to expand his project, having decided that a single work would not suffice for his purposes. He would, therefore, create a series of music dramas, each telling a stage of the story, basing the narrative on a combination of myth and imagination; &quot;Siegfried&#x27;s Death&quot; would provide the culmination. In 1851, he outlined his purposes in his essay &quot;A Communication to My Friends&quot;: &quot;I propose to produce my myth in three complete dramas, preceded by a lengthy Prelude (Vorspiel)&quot;. Each of these dramas would, he said, constitute an independent whole, but would not be performed separately. &quot;At a specially appointed Festival, I propose, some future time, to produce those three Dramas with their Prelude, in the course of three days and a fore-evening&quot;.

In accordance with this scheme, Wagner preceded &quot;Siegfried&#x27;s Death&quot; (later &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; (&quot;The Twilight of the Gods&quot;) with the story of Siegfried&#x27;s youth, &quot;Young Siegfried&quot;, later renamed &quot;Siegfried&quot;. This was, in turn, preceded by &quot;Die Walküre&quot; (&quot;The Valkyrie&quot;), dealing with Siegfried&#x27;s origins, the whole tetralogy being fronted by a prologue, &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;. Because Wagner prepared his texts in reverse chronological sequence, &quot;Die Walküre&quot; was the third of the dramas to be conceived and written, but appears second in the tetralogy.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
===Prior history===
During the lengthy time that has passed since the gods entered Valhalla at the end of &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, Fafner has used the Tarnhelm to assume the form of a dragon, and guards the gold and the ring in the depths of the forest. Wotan has visited Erda seeking wisdom, and by her has fathered a daughter, Brünnhilde; he has fathered eight other daughters, possibly also by Erda. These, with Brünnhilde, are the Valkyries, whose task is to recover heroes fallen in battle and bring them to Valhalla, where they will protect the fortress from Alberich&#x27;s assault should the dwarf recover the ring. Wotan has also wandered the earth, and with a woman of the Völsung race has fathered the twins Siegmund and Sieglinde, who have grown up separately and unaware of each other. From the Völsungs Wotan hopes for a hero who, unencumbered by the gods&#x27; treaties, will obtain the ring from Fafner.

===Act 1===
Prelude to Act I

&quot;Scene 1&quot;

As a large storm rages, Siegmund finds shelter from his enemies in a large dwelling built around a massive ash tree. Unarmed and wounded, he collapses with exhaustion. Sieglinde enters; she gives Siegmund some water and some honeyed mead, and tells him that she is the wife of Hunding, and that he may rest there until Hunding&#x27;s return. As they talk, they look at each other with growing interest and emotion. Siegmund gets ready to leave, telling Sieglinde that misfortune follows him, and he does not want to bring it on her; she replies that misfortune dwells with her already.

Orchestral Interlude

&quot;Scene 2&quot;

Hunding returns and questions Siegmund&#x27;s presence. Calling himself Wehwalt (&quot;woeful&quot;), Siegmund explains that he grew up in the forest with his parents and twin sister. One day he found their home burned down, his mother killed and his sister gone. Recently he fought with the relatives of a girl being forced into marriage. His weapons were destroyed, the bride was killed, and he was forced to flee. Hunding reveals that he is kin to Siegmund&#x27;s pursuers; Siegmund may stay, he says, but they must fight in the morning. Before leaving, Sieglinde gives a meaningful glance to a particular spot on the tree in which, the firelight reveals, a sword is buried to the hilt.

&quot;Scene 3&quot;

Sieglinde returns, having drugged Hunding&#x27;s drink. She reveals that she was forced into the marriage and that during their wedding feast, an old man appeared and plunged a sword into the trunk of the ash tree which neither Hunding nor any of his companions have been able to remove. She is longing for the hero who will draw the sword and save her. When Siegmund expresses his love for her, she reciprocates, and when he speaks the name of his father, Wälse, she recognises him as Siegmund, and realises that the sword was left for him. Siegmund then draws the sword from the tree. She reveals herself as Sieglinde, his twin sister. Siegmund names the sword &quot;Nothung&quot; and declares that it will be her protection. The two sing of their passionate love for each other, as the act ends.

===Act 2===
Prelude to Act 2

&quot;Scene 1&quot;

On a high mountain ridge, Wotan instructs Brünnhilde, his Valkyrie daughter, to protect Siegmund in his forthcoming battle with Hunding. Fricka arrives, and in her role as goddess of family values demands that Siegmund and Sieglinde be punished for their adultery and incest. She scorns Wotan&#x27;s argument that he requires Siegmund as a &quot;free hero&quot;, who can further his plans to recover the ring from Fafner, uninhibited by Wotan&#x27;s contracts. She retorts that Siegmund is not free but is Wotan&#x27;s pawn, whose every move the god seeks to direct. Realising that Siegmund is indeed not the free hero he needs for his grand plan, Wotan reluctantly agrees that he will not protect his son. 

&quot;Scene 2&quot;

After Fricka leaves, the troubled Wotan gives Brünnhilde the full story, and with great sorrow rescinds his earlier instruction; he orders her to give the victory to Hunding and then departs.

Orchestral Interlude

&quot;Scene 3&quot;

Sieglinde, who has suffered a panic attack during the night, is running away from Siegmund, who is pursuing her in alarm. He catches up with her, and she reveals that she regards herself as unworthy of her brother&#x27;s love due to her forced marriage with Hunding. Siegmund tries in vain to comfort her. With a vision of Hunding&#x27;s dogs pulling Siegmund down by his feet, Sieglinde faints, consumed with guilt and exhaustion. 

Orchestral Interlude

&quot;Scene 4&quot;

Brünnhilde suddenly appears to Siegmund and tells him of his impending death; he refuses to follow Brünnhilde to Valhalla when she tells him Sieglinde cannot accompany him. Siegmund still believes that his father&#x27;s sword will assure him of victory over Hunding, but Brünnhilde tells him it has lost its power. Siegmund threatens to kill Sieglinde rather than abandon her, friendless, after his death. Brünnhilde attempts to dissuade him by revealing that Sieglinde is pregnant with their child, but Siegmund simply prepares to kill both Sieglinde and the unborn child. Much moved, Brünnhilde decides to defy her father and grant victory to Siegmund.

&quot;Scene 5&quot;

Hunding&#x27;s horn is heard; he arrives and attacks Siegmund. Under Brünnhilde&#x27;s power, Siegmund begins to overpower Hunding, but Wotan appears and shatters Siegmund&#x27;s sword with his spear. Hunding stabs Siegmund to death. Brünnhilde gathers up the fragments of the sword and flees on horseback with Sieglinde. Contemptuously, Wotan kills Hunding with a simple wave of hand, and sets out in pursuit of Brünnhilde, vowing to punish her harshly for her disobedience.

===Act 3===
Prelude to Act 3 - &quot;Walkürenritt&quot; (&quot;The Ride of the Valkyries&quot;)

&quot;Scene 1&quot;

The Valkyries congregate on the mountain-top, each carrying a dead hero and chattering excitedly. Brünnhilde arrives with Sieglinde, and begs her sisters for help, but they dare not defy Wotan. Sieglinde tells Brünnhilde that without Siegmund she no longer wishes to live. Brünnhilde tells Sieglinde that she is pregnant by Siegmund, and urges her to remain alive for her child&#x27;s sake, and to name the child Siegfried. Brünnhilde gives the fragments of the sword Nothung to Sieglinde, who thanks her for her loyalty and comfort, and resolves to save the child. As she departs, Wotan is heard approaching with great wrath.

&quot;Scene 2&quot;

When Wotan arrives, the Valkyries vainly try to hide Brünnhilde. He faces her and declares her punishment: she is to be stripped of her Valkyrie status and become a mortal woman, to be held in defenceless sleep on the mountain, prey to any man who finds her. The other Valkyries protest, but when Wotan threatens them with the same, they flee. 

Orchestral Interlude

&quot;Scene 3&quot;

In a long discourse with Wotan, Brünnhilde explains that she decided to protect Sieglinde knowing that this was Wotan&#x27;s true desire. Wotan consents to her request that he surround her resting place with a circle of fire that will protect her from all but the bravest of heroes. He bids her a loving farewell and lays her sleeping form down on a rock. He then invokes Loge, the demigod of fire, and creates a circle of perpetual fire around her. Before slowly departing, Wotan pronounces that anyone who fears his spear shall never pass through the fire.

== Writing history ==
===Text, sources, characters===

Wagner&#x27;s original title for the work was &quot;Siegfried und Sieglind: der Walküre Bestrafung&quot; (&quot;Siegfried and Sieglinde: The Valkyrie Punished&quot;), but he quickly simplified this to &quot;Die Walküre&quot;. Prose sketches for the first two acts were prepared in November 1851, and for the third act early in the following year. These sketches were expanded to a more detailed prose plan in May 1852, and the full libretto was written in June 1852. It was privately printed, with the other &quot;Ring&quot; libretti, in February 1853.

Wagner constructed his &quot;Die Walküre&quot; libretto from a range of ancient Norse and Germanic sources, principally the Völsunga saga, the Poetic Edda, the Prose Edda, the Nibelungenlied and other fragments of Teutonic literature. From this plethora of material he selected particular elements and transformed them, to create his own narrative through the compression of events, the rearrangement of chronology and the fusion of characters. For example, in the Völsunga saga Siegmund is not Wotan&#x27;s son, although he arranges the latter&#x27;s conception by a Völsung woman. Sigurd (Siegfried) is not the child of Siegmund&#x27;s incestuous marriage to his sister, but of a later wife who preserves the sword fragments. Likewise, in the sagas Sieglinde is a somewhat different character, Signy; she is Siegmund&#x27;s twin sister, but the son she bears him is not Siegfried, and the manner of her death is quite different from that depicted by Wagner. Hunding is a conflation of several characters in the sagas, notably Siggeir who is wedded to Signy, and the villainous King Hunding who is Siegmund&#x27;s mortal enemy in the Poetic Edda.

Wotan (Odin) appears in the northern sagas as the god of all life as well as of battles, although he is by no means omnipotent. Fricka (Frigg) has most of the hallmarks of her counterpart in the Poetic and Prose Eddas, as wife of Wotan and goddess of family values. Brünnhilde is a less central figure in the sagas than she is in the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle. In an early lay, she is sought as a wife by Gunther, who seeks the help of Siegfried in overcoming her superhuman strength. Certain aspects of her &quot;Ring&quot; character appear in the Eddas and the Nibelungenlied, such as her encirclement by Wotan in a ring of fire, and her rescue by a hero without fear.

The Valkyries have a basis in historical fact, within the primitive Teutonic war-cult. According to Cooke, originally they were &quot;grisly old women who officiated at the sacrificial rites when prisoners were put to death.&quot; They became entwined in legend: in the Poetic Edda they emerge as supernatural warrior maidens carrying out Odin&#x27;s orders as to who should die. In the Poetic Edda the Valkyries are given names: Skuld, Skogul, Gunn, Hild, Gondul and Geirskogul. Some of these names differ in other sources. The names that Wagner gave to his Valkyries were his own invention, apart from Brünnhilde and Siegrune.

Wagner effected a number of changes between his original draft and the final text. For example, in the first sketch, Wotan appeared in person in Act I to drive the sword into the tree. Siegmund withdrew the sword much earlier in the act, and in Act II Hunding was not slain by Wotan, but left alive to follow Wotan&#x27;s instruction: &quot;Get hence, slave! Bow before Fricka.&quot;

===Composition===
Apart from some rough sketches, including an early version of what became Siegmund&#x27;s &quot;Spring Song&quot; in Act I of &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, Wagner composed the &quot;Ring&quot; music in its proper sequence. Having completed the music for &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; in May 1854, he began composing &quot;Die Walküre&quot; in June, and finished the full orchestral score nearly two years later, in March 1856. This extended period is explained by several concurrent events and distractions, including Wagner&#x27;s burgeoning friendship with Mathilde Wesendonck, and a lengthy concert tour in London at the invitation of the Royal Philharmonic Society, when he conducted a full season amid some controversy, although his own &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; overture was well received.

The system of leitmotifs, integral to the &quot;Opera and Drama&quot; principles, is used to the full in &quot;Die Walküre&quot;; Holman numbers 36 such motifs that are introduced in the work. The well-known &quot;Valkyrie&quot; motif, used to introduce Brünnhilde in Act II, forms the basis of the famous Ride of the Valkyries that opens Act III. Wagner wrote the concert version of the Ride in 1862, for performance in concerts at Vienna and Leipzig.

==Performances==
===Premiere, Munich, 26 June 1870===

As with &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, many years elapsed between the completion of the &quot;Die Walküre&quot; score and its first performance. Seeing little chance of the &quot;Ring&quot; project coming to any immediate fruition, and in need of money, in August 1857 Wagner abandoned work on it and concentrated instead on &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; and &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;, and on a revised version of &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;. However, King Ludwig of Bavaria, to whom Wagner had sold the copyrights to the &quot;Ring&quot; works, was insistent that the two completed &quot;Ring&quot; operas be staged, and over Wagner&#x27;s bitter protests arranged for them to be performed at the Munich Hofoper, &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; on 22 September 1869 and &quot;Die Walküre&quot; on 26 June 1870. The core of Wagner&#x27;s objection to a Munich performance was his relationship with the married Cosima von Bülow, with whom he was cohabiting in Switzerland; he could not return to Munich without provoking scandal, and therefore could not directly control the performances.

As the date for the &quot;Die Walküre&quot; premiere approached, Wagner grew more distressed and sullen; a letter from the critic Franz Müller reporting that everything was going well did nothing to console him. Cosima wrote in her diary that his distress &quot;pierces my heart like a dagger, and I ask myself whether this disgraceful act will really go unavenged?&quot;. The premiere was attended by leading figures from the musical world, including Liszt, Brahms, Camille Saint-Saëns, and the violinist Joseph Joachim. The reception from audience and critics was much more positive than had been the case a year earlier with &quot;Rheingold&quot;, although Osborne quotes one dissenting voice, from the critic of the &quot;Süddeutsche Presse&quot;. Having described the first act as &quot;for the most part, drearily long-winded&quot;, this critic thought that the second act dragged and came to life only occasionally. He went on: &quot;The third act begins so deafeningly that total stupor would be ensured even if the rest were less long-winded ... The overall effect of the music is not agreeable...&quot;. Cosima kept all communications from Munich away from Wagner, and tore up the more critical newspaper reviews.

After a second performance, &quot;Die Walküre&quot; was performed at the Hofoper three further times, alternating with &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; in a &quot;Ring&quot; semi-cycle. King Ludwig, who was absent from the premiere, attended one of the later performances. The Munich festival had taken place amid a mounting war fever, as relations between France and the German states rapidly deteriorated; the Franco-Prussian War broke out on 19 July.

===Bayreuth premiere, 14 August 1876===
In May 1872, Wagner laid the foundation stone for the Festspielhaus in Bayreuth, Northern Bavaria. He had originally envisaged holding the first Bayreuth Festival there in 1873, but delays in the building work, and in completing the &quot;Ring&quot; music, led to multiple postponements. Finally, the festival was scheduled for August 1876; &quot;Die Walküre&quot; would be performed on 14 August, the second day of the festival. 

Wagner was involved in every stage of the preparations; according to Ernest Newman&#x27;s biography he was &quot;a far better conductor than any of his conductors, a far better actor than any of his actors, a far better singer than any of his singers in everything but tone&quot;. Heinrich Porges, a contemporary chronicler, describes Wagner demonstrating to Amalie Materna, as Brünnhilde, how to sing the scene in which she tells Sieglinde of the impending birth of Siegfried: &quot;He sang [the final words] with truly thrilling force&quot;. The singer Lilli Lehmann (Helmwige), in her 1913 memoirs, remembered Wagner acting the role of Sieglinde in rehearsals: &quot;Never yet has a Sieglinde known how to approach him, even approximately&quot;.

The &quot;Die Walküre&quot; performance on 14 August was free from the mechanical problems that had affected &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; the day before, and was generally well received by the distinguished audience that included the Kaiser Wilhelm I, Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, representatives from various European royal houses and many of Europe&#x27;s leading composers. Wagner, however, was far from pleased. He was unnerved by an incident involving the kaiser, when the 79-year-old Wilhelm stumbled and almost fell over a doorstep, and was very critical of two of his main singers, Niemann and Betz, whom he deemed &quot;theatre parasites&quot; and said he would never employ again – a view he later revised. Among the scenes that he felt had not come off were those on the mountain-top: &quot;I&#x27;ll change that some day when I produce &quot;Walküre&quot; in heaven, at the right hand of God, and the old gent and I are watching it together&quot;.

Three &quot;Ring&quot; cycles were performed in the first Bayreuth Festival. The stage designs used in &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, and the other operas, were based on sketches by Josef Hoffman which were converted to stage sets by the Brückner brothers from the Coburg State Opera. These designs, and Carl Döpler&#x27;s costumes, influenced productions well into the 20th century.

===Revivals===
After the 1876 festival, &quot;Die Walküre&quot; was not seen again at Bayreuth for 20 years, until Cosima revived the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle for the 1896 festival. It was quickly taken up by other opera houses: Vienna and New York in 1877, Rotterdam in 1878 and London in 1882. The New York performance, on 2 April 1877, was conducted by Adolf Neuendorff as part of a Wagner festival organised by the Academy of Music; it preceded the Metropolitan Opera premiere by nearly eight years.

The London performance, at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre on 6 May 1882, was the first &quot;Ring&quot; cycle to be performed anywhere, after the 1876 Bayreuth premiere. It was conducted by Anton Seidl, who had been an assistant to Wagner at Bayreuth, and had Albert Niemann in his Bayreuth role as Siegmund. &quot;The Musical Times&quot;, in a long review, mixed approval with criticism: its reviewer noted a number of empty seats in the auditorium, thought the stage sets compared unfavourably with those at Bayreuth, and deemed the orchestra &quot;inefficient&quot;. However, the critic praised individual performances, and judged that the music and the drama had held the attention of an audience whose enthusiasm far exceeded that shown to &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; the previous day. The correspondent for &quot;The Era&quot; newspaper was distressed by the incestuous nature of the story, which it described as &quot;brutal and degrading&quot;, despite the quality of the music: &quot;A composer must have lost all sense of decency and all respect for the dignity of human nature who could thus employ his genius and skill&quot;.

The New York Met performance, on 30 January 1885, was part of a Wagner festival conducted by Leopold Damrosch – no other &quot;Ring&quot; operas were staged. Amalie Materna, Bayreuth&#x27;s original Brünnhilde, reprised the part here. The stage designer, Wilhelm Hock, recreated the original Bayreuth designs. The performance was received with great enthusiasm by the audience, who demanded numerous curtain calls. Damrosch fell ill just before the festival ended, and died on 15 February 1885.

During the 1880s and 1890s, &quot;Die Walküre&quot; was shown in many European cities, sometimes as part of a &quot;Ring&quot; cycle but often as an independent work: Brussels, Venice, Strasbourg and Budapest in 1883, Prague in 1885, St Petersburg in 1889, Copenhagen in 1891 and Stockholm in 1895. By then it was travelling worldwide: to Mexico in 1891, Argentina in 1899, Australia in 1907, South Africa in 1912 and Brazil in 1913. These productions often followed the Bayreuth line of staying close to the staging and costumes that Wagner had approved for the original festival, although there were some deviations, such as Adolphe Appia&#x27;s productions which replaced pictorialism with stylised sets using colours and lights.

At Bayreuth, no significant changes in presentation occurred until after the Second World War, when Wieland Wagner revealed his &quot;New Bayreuth&quot; style of largely bare stages and unadorned costumes. Although traditional productions continued outside Bayreuth, many performances followed the new trend. From the 1970s onwards there was increasing innovation; the Leipzig &quot;Die Walküre&quot; began the trend of placing the opening scene of Act II within Valhalla rather than on a mountain-top; Harry Kupfer at Bayreuth in 1988 set the whole cycle in a post-nuclear dystopia; Jürgen Flimm&#x27;s Bayreuth 2000 production had Wotan as a corrupt businessman, sitting in an office surrounded by 21st-century paraphernalia, including a paper-shredder used to cover his tracks. A few prominent productions adhered to traditional staging, including Otto Schenk&#x27;s at the New York Met in 1989, which was described by the &quot;New York Times&quot; as &quot;charmingly old fashioned&quot;, and as &quot;a relief to many beleaguered Wagnerites&quot;.

According to Charles Osborne, &quot;Die Walküre&quot; is sufficiently self-contained to be quite frequently staged on its own. The 2018 Bayreuth Festival broke new ground when for the first time it scheduled &quot;Die Walküre&quot; as a stand-alone, outside the context of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle.

==Music==
Osborne writes that, like &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, &quot;Die Walküre&quot; is primarily a work for solo voices, but with better integration of the vocal parts into the overall musical structure. As with its predecessor, Wagner composed &quot;Die Walküre&quot; under the principles he had defined in his book-length 1851 essay &quot;Opera and Drama&quot;, eschewing the traditional operatic norms of chorus, arias and vocal &quot;numbers&quot;. There is, however, some division of opinion as the extent that these principles were fully observed. The critic Barry Millington opines that of all Wagner&#x27;s works, &quot;Die Walküre&quot; is the fullest embodiment of the &quot;Opera and Drama&quot; precepts, achieving a complete synthesis of music and poetry. This, he says, is achieved without any notable sacrifice in musical expression&quot;. In his analytical essay &quot;The Perfect Wagnerite&quot;, Bernard Shaw praises the synthesis of music and drama: &quot;There is not ... a note in it that has any other point than the single direct point of giving musical expression to the drama&quot;. Gutman&#x27;s view, however, is that this only applies to the first two acts; the &quot;apogee&quot; of this style, he says, is found in the later opera &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot;. Roger Scruton refers to deviations in &quot;Die Walküre&quot; such as the &quot;Spring Song&quot; (&quot;Winterstürme&quot;), in which Siegmund holds up the action to declare his love for Sieglinde in what is to all intents and purposes an aria, while Osborne notes the &quot;impressive ensembles&quot; in Act III, as the Valkyries sing together.

===Act I===
The act opens in the key of D minor, which frames the music until Siegmund&#x27;s death in Act II. The short prelude depicts a storm; a stamping rhythm in the basses rises to a climax in which &quot;Donner&#x27;s Call&quot; from &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; is heard. As the scene proceeds, several new motifs are introduced; that representing Siegmund, derived from the &quot;Spear&quot; motif from &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;; that for Sieglinde, a gentle melody on strings, which Holman says &quot;conveys at once Sieglinde&#x27;s inner beauty and misfortune&quot;; and the motif which Newman names &quot;The Dawning of Love&quot;, which will recur in the final love duet of the act. These three motifs, and their developed variants, are prominent throughout the act. Among other motifs, the aggressive brass staccato that identifies Hunding is a particularly striking phrase, &quot;as dark and dour as the man himself&quot;.

Wagner uses other &quot;Rheingold&quot; motifs to deliver key information. Thus, the parentage of Siegmund and Sieglinde is revealed to the audience as Wotan, when the Valhalla music plays softly on trombones. The same theme references Wotan again, when Sieglinde recounts the visit of the old man at her wedding. A repeated falling octave in G♭, extracted from the &quot;Sword&quot; motif, illustrates Siegmund&#x27;s desperate desire for the sword, and recurs at the end of the act, together with the full &quot;Sword&quot; motif in triumphant brass, as he draws the sword from the tree.

===Act II===
The second act opens exuberantly, with a short prelude that prefigures the celebrated Valkyrie motif that in the following act will form the basis of the &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot; in Act III. This motif was first sketched in 1851, for intended use in &quot;Siegfried&#x27;s Tot&quot;, before the full plan of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle was developed. The first scene of the act introduces Brünnhilde&#x27;s energetic &quot;Hojotoho!&quot;, as she answers Wotan&#x27;s summons, expressing what Holman describes as her &quot;manly enthusiasm&quot; for her role as warrior maiden. The Wotan-Fricka dialogue that follows is illustrated by motifs that express Fricka&#x27;s sour disillusion with her marriage, and Wotan&#x27;s bitterness and frustration as he is unable to answer his wife&#x27;s forceful arguments.

In the colloquies between Wotan and Brünnhilde, several soundings of the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Worth&quot; motif are heard. The &quot;Annunciation of Death&quot; motif is the crucial point, where the two narratives (Wotan/Brünnhilde and Siegmund/Sieglinde) come together. Wagner chose the tonality of F♯ minor for this scene, eventually modulating to B minor in preparation for the Valkyries&#x27; entry in Act III.

===Act III===
The act opens with the famous sequence known as the &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot;, formed by combining the Valkyries&#x27; own belligerent theme with Brünnhilde&#x27;s war cry from act II. The Ride has achieved lasting popularity as an orchestral concert piece outside the framework of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle; according to Newman, in the orchestral version and sometimes within the opera itself, the basis staccato phrasing is corrupted by eliding the second and third notes and emphasising the fourth rather than the first as originally written.

At the midpoint of the act, prior to Wotan&#x27;s vengeful entrance and the long denouement with Brünnhilde, we hear the &quot;Reconciliation&quot; motif (&quot;Redemption by Love&quot; per Newman) in which Sieglinde praises Brünnhilde for her rescue: &quot;O highest of wonders! Noblest of maids!&quot;. The motif will next be heard at the very end of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle, bringing the entire tetralogy to a close on a note of reconciliation and optimism.
The final section of the act is marked by what Millington describes as &quot;a succession of carefully controlled climaxes&quot;, of which the most affecting is that of Wotan&#x27;s farewell to his errant daughter. The music is eventually dominated by the five falling notes of Brünnhilde&#x27;s &quot;Sleep&quot; motif which, when Wotan has used his spear to summon Loge, is transformed into the &quot;Magic Fire&quot; music as Brünnhilde is encircled in the ring of fire, and Wotan sadly departs.

===Instrumentation===

==Critical assessment==

The first Munich performances of &quot;Die Walküre&quot; were generally hailed as successes by audiences and critics; leading composers who were present greeted the work with acclaim, recognising in it evidence of Wagner&#x27;s genius. One dissident voice was presented by the critic of the &quot;Süddeutsche Presse&quot;, who was scathing about the dearth of moral standards expressed in the story and furthermore found the whole experience tedious: the first act was, for the most part, &quot;wearyingly long-winded&quot;; the second act only occasionally sprang to life, while in the third it was &quot;barely possible to hear isolated shrieks from the singers through the tumult of the orchestra&quot;. The overall effect was &quot;not agreeable ... permeated with what one can only call pagan sensuality, and ... produces finally nothing but an enervating dullness&quot;. This harsh, if isolated judgement, found some echo six years later, when &quot;Die Walküre&quot; was first performed at Bayreuth as part of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle. Critics could now form relative views on the merits of the four operas. Although there was general admiration for the first act, &quot;Die Walküre&quot; emerged as the least-liked of the four, in particular on account of the second act, deemed &quot;a great failure&quot; and an &quot;abyss of boredom&quot;.

Many modern critics of &quot;Die Walküre&quot; have recorded much more positive opinions. To Charles Osborne it is &quot;marvellously rich ... Wagner has found a way to integrate his voice parts into the overall structure without sacrificing their lyrical independence&quot;. It is, he says, the opera that stands up most strongly outside the tetralogy, and is popular enough to be staged frequently on its own, even within Bayreuth festivals.

Writing in 2006, Millington thought that, notwithstanding the liberal use of ensembles in the third act, &quot;Die Walküre&quot; showed the greatest fidelity of the four operas to the theoretical principles expressed by Wagner in &quot;Opera and Drama&quot;: &quot;A thoroughgoing synthesis of poetry and music is achieved without any notable sacrifice in musical expression&quot;. The modern view is that, of the &quot;Ring&quot; operas, &quot;Die Walküre&quot; is both the most approachable and the one that can most successfully be performed in extracts.

The libretto of &quot;Siegfried&quot; was drafted by Wagner in November–December 1852, based on an earlier version he had prepared in May–June 1851 and originally entitled &quot;Jung-Siegfried&quot; (&quot;Young Siegfried&quot;), later changed to &quot;Der junge Siegfried&quot;. The musical composition was commenced in 1856, but not finally completed until 1871.

The libretto arose from Wagner&#x27;s gradual reconception of the project he had initiated with his libretto &quot;Siegfrieds Tod&quot; (&quot;Siegfried&#x27;s Death&quot;) which was eventually to be incarnated as &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;, the final section of the Ring cycle. Having sketched music and worked with the text for &quot;Siegfrieds Tod&quot; in 1851, he realized that it would need a &#x27;preface&#x27;. At this point he conceived that the prefatory opera, &quot;Der junge Siegfried&quot;, could act as a comic foil to the tragedy of &quot;Siegfrieds Tod&quot;. Preliminary musical sketches for &quot;Der junge Siegfried&quot; in 1851 were however quickly abandoned, although Wagner had written to his friend Theodor Uhlig that &quot;the musical phrases are making themselves for these stanzas and periods, without my even having to take pains for them. It&#x27;s all growing out of the ground as if it were wild.&quot; Shortly afterwards he wrote to Uhlig that he was now planning to tell the Siegfried story in the form of &quot;three dramas, plus a prologue in three acts&quot;—a clear prefiguring of the Ring cycle.

Full work was finally commenced on the music of &quot;Siegfried&quot;, as the composer henceforth referred to it, in 1856, when Wagner prepared concurrently two drafts, a complete draft in pencil and a version in ink on up to three staves in which he worked out details of instrumentation and vocal line. The composition of Acts I and II was completed by August 1857. Wagner then left off work on &quot;Siegfried&quot; to write the operas &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; and &quot;Die Meistersinger.&quot; He did not resume work on &quot;Siegfried&quot; until 1869, when he composed the third act. The final revision of the score was undertaken in February 1871. Performance was withheld until the first complete production of the Ring cycle, at Bayreuth in August 1876.

=== Act 1 ===

Prelude to Act 1

&quot;Scene 1&quot;

A cave in rocks in the forest. An orchestral introduction includes references to leitmotifs including themes relating to the original hoard plundered by the Nibelung Alberich, and one in B-flat minor associated with the Nibelungs themselves. As the curtain rises, Alberich&#x27;s brother, the dwarf Mime, is forging a sword (&quot;Zwangvolle Plage!&quot;). Mime is plotting to obtain the ring of power originally created by his brother Alberich. He has raised the human boy Siegfried as a foster child, to kill Fafner, who obtained the ring and other treasures in the opera &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; and has since transformed himself from a giant to a dragon. Mime needs a sword for Siegfried to use, but the youth has contemptuously broken every sword Mime has made. Siegfried returns from his wanderings in the forest driving before him a large bear that terrifies Mime, and immediately breaks the new sword. After a whining speech by Mime about ingratitude, and how Mime has brought him up from a mewling infant (&quot;Als zullendes Kind&quot;), Siegfried senses why he keeps coming back to Mime although he despises him: he wants to know his parentage. Mime is forced to explain that he encountered Siegfried&#x27;s mother, Sieglinde, when she was in labor; she died giving birth to Siegfried. He shows Siegfried the broken pieces of the sword Nothung, which she had left in his custody. Siegfried orders him to reforge the sword; however, Mime is unable to accomplish this. Siegfried departs, leaving Mime in despair (&quot;Aus dem Wald fort in die Welt zieh’n&quot;).

&quot;Scene 2&quot;

An old man (Wotan in disguise) arrives at the door and introduces himself as the Wanderer (&quot;Heil dir, weiser Schmied!&quot;). In return for the hospitality due a guest, he wagers his head on answering any three questions Mime may ask. The dwarf asks the Wanderer to name the races that live beneath the ground, on the earth, and in the skies. These are the Nibelungs, the Giants, and the Gods, as the Wanderer answers correctly. When Mime still refuses hospitality, the Wanderer demands that Mime answer &quot;his&quot; three questions, or yield his own head. The Wanderer asks Mime to identify: the race most beloved of Wotan, but most harshly treated; the name of the sword that can destroy Fafner; and the person who can repair the sword. Mime can answer only the first two questions: the Wälsungs (Siegmund and Sieglinde whose tale is told in the opera &quot;Die Walküre&quot;) and the sword Nothung. Wotan tells him that only &quot;he who does not know fear&quot; can reforge Nothung, and abstains from taking Mime&#x27;s head, leaving it for that person.

&quot;Scene 3&quot;

Mime despairs as he imagines the ferocity of the dragon Fafner, while &quot;the orchestra paints a dazzling picture of flickering lights and roaring flames&quot; (&quot;Verfluchtes Licht!&quot;). Siegfried returns and is annoyed by Mime&#x27;s lack of progress. Mime realizes that Siegfried is &quot;the one who does not know fear&quot; and that unless he can instill fear in him, Siegfried will kill him as the Wanderer foretold. He tells Siegfried that fear is an essential craft; Siegfried is eager to learn it, and Mime promises to teach him by taking him to Fafner (&quot;Fühltest du nie im finst’ren Wald&quot;). Since Mime was unable to forge Nothung, Siegfried decides to do it himself (&quot;Nothung! Nothung! Neidliches Schwert!&quot;). He succeeds by shredding the metal, melting it, and casting it anew. In the meantime, Mime brews a poisoned drink to offer Siegfried after the youth has defeated the dragon. After he finishes forging the sword, Siegfried demonstrates its strength by chopping the anvil in half with it (&quot;Hoho! Hoho! Hohei! Schmiede, mein Hammer, ein hartes Schwert!&quot; - &quot;Siegfrieds Schmiedelied&quot; - &quot;Siegfried&#x27;s Forging Song&quot;).

===Act 2===

Prelude to Act 2 - &quot;Fafners Ruhe&quot; (&quot;Fafner&#x27;s Rest&quot;)

&quot;Scene 1&quot;

Deep in the forest. The Wanderer arrives at the entrance to Fafner&#x27;s cave, near which Alberich secretly keeps vigil by a rocky cliff (&quot;Im Wald und Nacht&quot;). The two enemies recognize each other. Alberich boasts of his plans to regain the ring and rule the world. Wotan states that he does not intend to interfere, only to observe. He even offers to awaken the dragon so that Alberich can bargain with him. Alberich warns the dragon that a hero is coming to kill him, and offers to prevent the fight in exchange for the ring. Fafner dismisses the threat, declines Alberich&#x27;s offer, and returns to sleep. Wotan mysteriously advises Alberich that all things follow their own necessary ways which no one will change. He then rides away on his horse, leaving Alberich alone. Alberich withdraws and hides himself again in the rocks.

Orchestral Interlude

&quot;Scene 2&quot;

At daybreak, Siegfried and Mime arrive. After assuring Siegfried that the dragon will teach him what fear is, Mime withdraws. As Siegfried waits for the dragon to appear, he hears a woodbird singing from the trees (&quot;Waldweben&quot; - &quot;Forest Murmurs&quot;). He attempts to mimic the bird&#x27;s song using a reed pipe, but is unsuccessful. He then plays a tune on his horn (&quot;Siegfrieds Hornruf&quot; - &quot;Siegfried&#x27;s Horn Call&quot;), which unintentionally wakes Fafner in his cave. After a short exchange, they fight; Siegfried stabs Fafner in the heart with Nothung. Regretful about his own life Fafner in his last moments learns the boy&#x27;s name and tells Siegfried to beware the might of the curse, which condemns every lord of the Ring to death, just as it has now brought death to him. When Siegfried withdraws his sword from Fafner&#x27;s body, his hands are burned by the dragon&#x27;s hot blood and he puts his finger in his mouth. On tasting the blood, he finds that he can understand the woodbird&#x27;s song (&quot;Hei! Siegfried gehört nun der Niblungen Hort!&quot;). Following its instructions, he takes the ring and the magic helmet Tarnhelm from Fafner&#x27;s hoard.

&quot;Scene 3&quot;

Outside the cave, Alberich and Mime meet and quarrel over the treasure (&quot;Wohin schleichst du eilig und schlau&quot;). Alberich hides as Siegfried comes out of the cave. Siegfried contemplates the ring but doesn&#x27;t know what could be its use, viewing it just innocently as a valueless object of nature (&quot;Was ihr mir nützt, weiß ich nicht&quot;); nevertheless, on the forest bird&#x27;s advice he decides to keep it. Then he complains to Mime that not even the dragon Fafner has taught him the meaning of fear. Mime congratulates him on having won his battle, and offers him the poisoned drink; however, the magic power of the dragon&#x27;s blood allows Siegfried to read Mime&#x27;s treacherous thoughts, and he stabs him to death (&quot;Willkommen, Siegfried!&quot;). Hidden nearby, Alberich is heard laughing spitefully at his brother&#x27;s death. Siegfried puts Mime&#x27;s body into the treasure cave and places Fafner&#x27;s body in the cave entrance to block it. The woodbird now sings of a woman sleeping on a rock surrounded by magic fire (&quot;Nun sing! Ich lausche dem Gesang&quot;). Siegfried, wondering if he can learn fear from this woman, follows the bird towards the rock.

===Act 3===

Prelude to Act 3

&quot;Scene 1&quot;

At the foot of Brünnhilde&#x27;s rock. The Wanderer summons Erda, the earth goddess (&quot;Wache, Wala!&quot;). Erda, appearing confused, is unable to offer any advice (&quot;Männerthaten umdämmern mir den Muth&quot;). Wotan informs her that he no longer fears the end of the gods; indeed, he wills it, because he now recognizes that through his own demise the true heritage of his life will be left to the independent pair free from envy in their love, to Siegfried the Wälsung, who took Alberich&#x27;s ring without succumbing to its corrupting influence thanks to his fearlessness, and Brünnhilde (Erda&#x27;s and Wotan&#x27;s child), who will work the deed that redeems the World (&quot;Dir Unweisen ruf’ ich’s in’s Ohr&quot;). Dismissed, Erda sinks back into the earth.

&quot;Scene 2&quot;

Siegfried arrives, and the Wanderer questions the youth (&quot;Mein Vöglein schwebte mir fort&quot;). Siegfried, who does not recognize his grandfather, answers insolently and starts down the path toward Brünnhilde&#x27;s rock. The Wanderer blocks his path, but Siegfried mocks him, laughing at his floppy hat and his missing eye, and breaks his spear (the symbol and source of Wotan&#x27;s authority and power) with a blow from Nothung. Wotan, accepting his fate, calmly gathers up the pieces and vanishes (&quot;Zieh’ hin! Ich kann dich nicht halten!&quot;).

Orchestral Interlude

&quot;Scene 3&quot;

Thanks to his fearlessness Siegfried passes through the ring of fire, emerging on Brünnhilde&#x27;s rock (&quot;Selige Öde auf sonniger Höh’!&quot;). At first, he thinks the sleeping armored figure is a man. However, when he removes the armor, he finds a woman beneath. At the sight of the first woman he has ever seen and struck with the feeling of love, Siegfried at last experiences fear. In desperation, he kisses Brünnhilde, waking her from her magic sleep. Upon waking she hails the Sun and greets Siegfried as the World&#x27;s Light (&quot;Heil dir, Sonne! Heil dir, Licht!&quot;). Afraid and hesitant at first to do so, Brünnhilde is eventually won over by Siegfried&#x27;s love and renounces through her love for him the world of the gods and with it her own powers (&quot;Ewig war ich, ewig bin ich&quot;). Together, they solemnly sing praises to love, in comparison with which the glory of the gods itself seems dimmed and in which even dying can be jubilant: &quot;radiant love, laughing death!&quot; (&quot;Leuchtende Liebe, lachender Tod!&quot;)

==Sources==
Elements of the plot of &quot;Siegfried&quot; come from a variety of sources.

In a letter to Uhlig, Wagner recounted &quot;The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was&quot;, based on a fairy-tale of the Brothers Grimm. It concerns a boy so stupid he had never learned to be afraid. Wagner wrote that the boy and Siegfried are the same character. The boy is taught to fear by his wife, and Siegfried learns it when he discovers the sleeping Brünnhilde.

Siegfried&#x27;s ability in Act Two to see through Mime&#x27;s deceitful words seems to have been derived from a 19th-century street theatre version of the story of Faust.

Some elements of the story are derived from legends of Sigurd, notably the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; and the &quot;Thidrekssaga&quot;. Scene 1 of Act III (between The Wanderer and Erda) has a parallel in the Eddic poem &quot;Baldrs draumar&quot;, in which Odin questions a völva about the future of the gods.

<text>Bernhard von Reesen (1491 – 1521) was a successful merchant born to a patrician family in the Hanseatic city of Danzig (Gdańsk). The Reesen name, with its prefix &quot;von&quot; (of), indicates that the family had its origins in the city of Rees.

He was the son of Bernd von Reesen (c. 1460 – 1506) and Brigitte Proite (d. 1506) who were married in 1489. His younger brother Heinrich (1497 – 1532) was also a merchant; his eldest sister, Margarethe (b. 1490), married, in 1516, Hans (Johann) von Schwarzwald (1468 – 1521), an alderman of Danzig.

Reesen was highly educated as was the custom for men of his background at that time. The wealthy businessman was evidently one of a circle of merchants with whom Albrecht Dürer of Nuremberg and his wife were in regular contact while the artist was in Antwerp. In early 1521, when Reesen was about thirty, Dürer painted his portrait. The painting can be seen in the permanent exhibition of Old Masters in Dresden, Germany.

He died in October 1521, &quot;tempore pestis&quot; according to the chronicler, Stenzel Bornbach. The day, place and cause of his death are unknown.

<text>Henri Léon Lebesgue (; ; June 28, 1875 – July 26, 1941) was a French mathematician known for his theory of integration, which was a generalization of the 17th-century concept of integration—summing the area between an axis and the curve of a function defined for that axis. His theory was published originally in his dissertation &quot;Intégrale, longueur, aire&quot; (&quot;Integral, length, area&quot;) at the University of Nancy during 1902.

==Personal life==
Henri Lebesgue was born on 28 June 1875 in Beauvais, Oise. Lebesgue&#x27;s father was a typesetter and his mother was a school teacher. His parents assembled at home a library that the young Henri was able to use. His father died of tuberculosis when Lebesgue was still very young and his mother had to support him by herself. As he showed a remarkable talent for mathematics in primary school, one of his instructors arranged for community support to continue his education at the Collège de Beauvais and then at Lycée Saint-Louis and Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris.

In 1894, Lebesgue was accepted at the École Normale Supérieure, where he continued to focus his energy on the study of mathematics, graduating in 1897. After graduation he remained at the École Normale Supérieure for two years, working in the library, where he became aware of the research on discontinuity done at that time by René-Louis Baire, a recent graduate of the school. At the same time he started his graduate studies at the Sorbonne, where he learned about Émile Borel&#x27;s work on the incipient measure theory and Camille Jordan&#x27;s work on the Jordan measure. In 1899 he moved to a teaching position at the Lycée Central in Nancy, while continuing work on his doctorate. In 1902 he earned his PhD from the Sorbonne with the seminal thesis on &quot;Integral, Length, Area&quot;, submitted with Borel, four years older, as advisor.

Lebesgue married the sister of one of his fellow students, and he and his wife had two children, Suzanne and Jacques.

After publishing his thesis, Lebesgue was offered in 1902 a position at the University of Rennes, lecturing there until 1906, when he moved to the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Poitiers. In 1910 Lebesgue moved to the Sorbonne as a maître de conférences, being promoted to professor starting in 1919. In 1921 he left the Sorbonne to become professor of mathematics at the Collège de France, where he lectured and did research for the rest of his life. In 1922 he was elected a member of the Académie des Sciences. Henri Lebesgue died on 26 July 1941 in Paris.

==Mathematical career==

Lebesgue&#x27;s first paper was published in 1898 and was titled &quot;Sur l&#x27;approximation des fonctions&quot;. It dealt with Weierstrass&#x27;s theorem on approximation to continuous functions by polynomials. Between March 1899 and April 1901 Lebesgue published six notes in &quot;Comptes Rendus.&quot; The first of these, unrelated to his development of Lebesgue integration, dealt with the extension of Baire&#x27;s theorem to functions of two variables. The next five dealt with surfaces applicable to a plane, the area of skew polygons, surface integrals of minimum area with a given bound, and the final note gave the definition of Lebesgue integration for some function f(x). Lebesgue&#x27;s great thesis, &quot;Intégrale, longueur, aire&quot;, with the full account of this work, appeared in the Annali di Matematica in 1902. The first chapter develops the theory of measure (see Borel measure). In the second chapter he defines the integral both geometrically and analytically. The next chapters expand the &quot;Comptes Rendus&quot; notes dealing with length, area and applicable surfaces. The final chapter deals mainly with Plateau&#x27;s problem. This dissertation is considered to be one of the finest ever written by a mathematician.

His lectures from 1902 to 1903 were collected into a &quot;Borel tract&quot; &quot;Leçons sur l&#x27;intégration et la recherche des fonctions primitives&quot;. The problem of integration regarded as the search for a primitive function is the keynote of the book. Lebesgue presents the problem of integration in its historical context, addressing Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, and Bernhard Riemann. Lebesgue presents six conditions which it is desirable that the integral should satisfy, the last of which is &quot;If the sequence fn(x) increases to the limit f(x), the integral of fn(x) tends to the integral of f(x).&quot; Lebesgue shows that his conditions lead to the theory of measure and measurable functions and the analytical and geometrical definitions of the integral.

He turned next to trigonometric functions with his 1903 paper &quot;Sur les séries trigonométriques&quot;. He presented three major theorems in this work: that a trigonometrical series representing a bounded function is a Fourier series, that the nth Fourier coefficient tends to zero (the Riemann–Lebesgue lemma), and that a Fourier series is integrable term by term. In 1904-1905 Lebesgue lectured once again at the Collège de France, this time on trigonometrical series and he went on to publish his lectures in another of the &quot;Borel tracts&quot;. In this tract he once again treats the subject in its historical context. He expounds on Fourier series, Cantor-Riemann theory, the Poisson integral and the Dirichlet problem.

In a 1910 paper, &quot;Représentation trigonométrique approchée des fonctions satisfaisant a une condition de Lipschitz&quot; deals with the Fourier series of functions satisfying a Lipschitz condition, with an evaluation of the order of magnitude of the remainder term. He also proves that the Riemann–Lebesgue lemma is a best possible result for continuous functions, and gives some treatment to Lebesgue constants.

Lebesgue once wrote, &quot;Réduites à des théories générales, les mathématiques seraient une belle forme sans contenu.&quot; (&quot;Reduced to general theories, mathematics would be a beautiful form without content.&quot;)

In measure-theoretic analysis and related branches of mathematics, the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral generalizes Riemann–Stieltjes and Lebesgue integration, preserving the many advantages of the latter in a more general measure-theoretic framework.

During the course of his career, Lebesgue also made forays into the realms of complex analysis and topology. He also had a disagreement with Émile Borel about whose integral was more general. However, these minor forays pale in comparison to his contributions to real analysis; his contributions to this field had a tremendous impact on the shape of the field today and his methods have become an essential part of modern analysis. These have important practical implications for fundamental physics of which Lebesgue would have been completely unaware, as noted below.

==Lebesgue&#x27;s theory of integration==


Integration is a mathematical operation that corresponds to the informal idea of finding the area under the graph of a function. The first theory of integration was developed by Archimedes in the 3rd century BC with his method of quadratures, but this could be applied only in limited circumstances with a high degree of geometric symmetry. In the 17th century, Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz discovered the idea that integration was intrinsically linked to differentiation, the latter being a way of measuring how quickly a function changed at any given point on the graph. This surprising relationship between two major geometric operations in calculus, differentiation and integration, is now known as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. It has allowed mathematicians to calculate a broad class of integrals for the first time. However, unlike Archimedes&#x27; method, which was based on Euclidean geometry, mathematicians felt that Newton&#x27;s and Leibniz&#x27;s integral calculus did not have a rigorous foundation.

The mathematical notion of limit and the closely related notion of convergence are central to any modern definition of integration. In the 19th century, Karl Weierstrass developed the rigorous epsilon-delta definition of a limit, which is still accepted and used by mathematicians today. He built on previous but non-rigorous work by Augustin Cauchy, who had used the non-standard notion of infinitesimally small numbers, today rejected in standard mathematical analysis. Before Cauchy, Bernard Bolzano had laid the fundamental groundwork of the epsilon-delta definition. See here for more.

Bernhard Riemann followed up on this by formalizing what is now called the Riemann integral. To define this integral, one fills the area under the graph with smaller and smaller rectangles and takes the limit of the sums of the areas of the rectangles at each stage. For some functions, however, the total area of these rectangles does not approach a single number. Thus, they have no Riemann integral.

Lebesgue invented a new method of integration to solve this problem. Instead of using the areas of rectangles, which put the focus on the domain of the function, Lebesgue looked at the codomain of the function for his fundamental unit of area. Lebesgue&#x27;s idea was to first define measure, for both sets and functions on those sets. He then proceeded to build the integral for what he called simple functions; measurable functions that take only finitely many values. Then he defined it for more complicated functions as the least upper bound of all the integrals of simple functions smaller than the function in question.

Lebesgue integration has the property that every function defined over a bounded interval with a Riemann integral also has a Lebesgue integral, and for those functions the two integrals agree. Furthermore, every bounded function on a closed bounded interval has a Lebesgue integral and there are many functions with a Lebesgue integral that have no Riemann integral.

As part of the development of Lebesgue integration, Lebesgue invented the concept of measure, which extends the idea of length from intervals to a very large class of sets, called measurable sets (so, more precisely, simple functions are functions that take a finite number of values, and each value is taken on a measurable set).
Lebesgue&#x27;s technique for turning a measure into an integral generalises easily to many other situations, leading to the modern field of measure theory.

The Lebesgue integral is deficient in one respect. The Riemann integral generalises to the improper Riemann integral to measure functions whose domain of definition is not a closed interval. The Lebesgue integral integrates many of these functions (always reproducing the same answer when it does), but not all of them. For functions on the real line, the Henstock integral is an even more general notion of integral (based on Riemann&#x27;s theory rather than Lebesgue&#x27;s) that subsumes both Lebesgue integration and improper Riemann integration. However, the Henstock integral depends on specific ordering features of the real line and so does not generalise to allow integration in more general spaces (say, manifolds), while the Lebesgue integral extends to such spaces quite naturally.

==Implications for statistical mechanics==
In 1947 Norbert Wiener claimed that the Lebesgue integral had unexpected but important implications in establishing the validity of Willard Gibbs&#x27; work on the foundations of statistical mechanics. The notions of &quot;average&quot; and &quot;measure&quot; were urgently needed to provide a rigorous proof of Gibbs&#x27; ergodic hypothesis.
