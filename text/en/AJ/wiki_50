<text>Bebop or bop is a style of jazz developed in the early to mid-1940s in the United States. The style features compositions characterized by a fast tempo (usually exceeding 200 bpm), complex chord progressions with rapid chord changes and numerous changes of key, instrumental virtuosity, and improvisation based on a combination of harmonic structure, the use of scales, and occasional references to the melody.

Bebop developed as the younger generation of jazz musicians expanded the creative possibilities of jazz beyond the popular, dance-oriented swing music-style to a new &quot;musician&#x27;s music&quot; that was not as danceable and demanded close listening. As bebop was not intended for dancing, it enabled the musicians to play at faster tempos. Bebop musicians explored advanced harmonies, complex syncopation, altered chords, extended chords, chord substitutions, asymmetrical phrasing, and intricate melodies. Bebop groups used rhythm sections in a way that expanded their role. Whereas the key ensemble of the swing music era was the big band of up to fourteen pieces playing in an ensemble-based style, the classic bebop group was a small combo that consisted of saxophone (alto or tenor), trumpet, piano, guitar, double bass, and drums playing music in which the ensemble played a supportive role for soloists. Rather than play heavily arranged music, bebop musicians typically played the melody of a composition (called the &quot;head&quot;) with the accompaniment of the rhythm section, followed by a section in which each of the performers improvised a solo, then returned to the melody at the end of the composition.

Some of the most influential bebop artists, who were typically composer-performers, are alto sax player Charlie Parker; tenor sax players Dexter Gordon, Sonny Rollins, and James Moody; clarinet player Buddy DeFranco; trumpeters Fats Navarro, Miles Davis, and Dizzy Gillespie; pianists Bud Powell, Barry Harris and Thelonious Monk; electric guitarist Charlie Christian; and drummers Kenny Clarke, Max Roach, and Art Blakey.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;bebop&quot; is derived from nonsense syllables (vocables) used in scat singing; the first known example of &quot;bebop&quot; being used was in McKinney&#x27;s Cotton Pickers&#x27; &quot;Four or Five Times&quot;, recorded in 1928. It appears again in a 1936 recording of &quot;I&#x27;se a Muggin&#x27;&quot; by Jack Teagarden. A variation, &quot;rebop&quot;, appears in several 1939 recordings. The first known print appearance also occurred in 1939, but the term was little used subsequently until applied to the music now associated with it in the mid-1940s. Thelonious Monk claims that the original title &quot;Bip Bop&quot; for his composition &quot;52nd Street Theme&quot;, was the origin of the name &quot;bebop.&quot;

Some researchers speculate that it was a term used by Charlie Christian because it sounded like something he hummed along with his playing. Dizzy Gillespie stated that the audiences coined the name after hearing him scat the then-nameless compositions to his players and the press ultimately picked it up, using it as an official term: &quot;People, when they&#x27;d wanna ask for those numbers and didn&#x27;t know the name, would ask for bebop.&quot; Another theory is that it derives from the cry of &quot;Arriba! Arriba!&quot; used by Latin American bandleaders of the period to encourage their bands. At times, the terms &quot;bebop&quot; and &quot;rebop&quot; were used interchangeably. (Although rebop differed from bebop with its more impressionist use of discordant chords.) By 1945, the use of &quot;bebop&quot;/&quot;rebop&quot; as nonsense syllables was widespread in R&amp;B music, for instance Lionel Hampton&#x27;s &quot;Hey! Ba-Ba-Re-Bop&quot;. The bebop musician or bopper became a stock character in jokes of the 1950s, overlapping with the beatnik.

== Instrumentation ==

The classic bebop combo consisted of saxophone, trumpet, double bass, drums and piano. This was a format used (and popularized) by both Parker (alto sax) and Gillespie (trumpet) in their 1940s groups and recordings, sometimes augmented by an extra saxophonist or guitar (electric or acoustic), occasionally adding other horns (often a trombone) or other strings (usually violin) or dropping an instrument and leaving only a quartet. This was in stark contrast to the large ensembles favoured during the swing era.

== Musical style ==
Bebop differed drastically from the straightforward compositions of the swing era and was instead characterized by fast tempos, asymmetrical phrasing, intricate melodies, and rhythm sections that expanded on their role as tempo-keepers. The music itself seemed jarringly different to the ears of the public, who were used to the bouncy, organized, danceable compositions of Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller during the swing era. Instead, bebop appeared to sound racing, nervous, erratic and often fragmented.

While swing music tended to feature orchestrated big band arrangements, bebop music highlighted improvisation. Typically, a theme (a &quot;head,&quot; often the main melody of a pop or jazz standard of the swing era) would be presented together at the beginning and the end of each piece, with improvisational solos based on the chords of the compositions. Thus, the majority of a piece in bebop style would be improvisation, the only threads holding the work together being the underlying harmonies played by the rhythm section. Sometimes improvisation included references to the original melody or to other well-known melodic lines (&quot;quotes,&quot; &quot;licks&quot; or &quot;riffs&quot;). Sometimes they were entirely original, spontaneous melodies from start to finish.

Chord progressions for bebop compositions were often taken directly from popular swing-era compositions and reused with a new and more complex melody, forming new compositions (see contrafact). This practice was already well-established in earlier jazz, but came to be central to the bebop style. The style made use of several relatively common chord progressions, such as blues (at base, I-IV-V, but infused with II-V motion) and &quot;rhythm changes&quot; (I-VI-II-V, the chords to the 1930s pop standard &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot;). Late bop also moved towards extended forms that represented a departure from pop and show compositions. Bebop chord voicings often dispensed with the root and fifth tones, instead basing them on the leading intervals that defined the tonality of the chord. That opened up creative possibilities for harmonic improvisation such as tritone substitutions and use of diminished scale based improvised lines that could resolve to the key center in numerous and surprising ways.

Bebop musicians also employed several harmonic devices not typical of previous jazz. Complicated harmonic substitutions for more basic chords became commonplace. These substitutions often emphasized certain dissonant intervals such as the flat ninth, sharp ninth or the sharp eleventh/tritone. This unprecedented harmonic development which took place in bebop is often traced back to a transcendent moment experienced by Charlie Parker while performing &quot;Cherokee&quot; at Clark Monroe&#x27;s Uptown House, New York, in early 1942. As described by Parker:

I&#x27;d been getting bored with the stereotyped changes that were being used ... and I kept thinking there&#x27;s bound to be something else. I could hear it sometimes. I couldn&#x27;t play it... I was working over &quot;Cherokee&quot;, and, as I did, I found that by using the higher intervals of a chord as a melody line and backing them with appropriately related changes, I could play the thing I&#x27;d been hearing. It came alive.

Gerhard Kubik postulates that the harmonic development in bebop sprang from the blues, and other African-related tonal sensibilities, rather than twentieth century Western art music, as some have suggested. Kubik states: &quot;Auditory inclinations were the African legacy in [Parker&#x27;s] life, reconfirmed by the experience of the blues tonal system, a sound world at odds with the Western diatonic chord categories. Bebop musicians eliminated Western-style functional harmony in their music while retaining the strong central tonality of the blues as a basis for drawing upon various African matrices.&quot; Samuel Floyd states that blues were both the bedrock and propelling force of bebop, bringing about three main developments:
* A new harmonic conception, using extended chord structures that led to unprecedented harmonic and melodic variety.
* A developed and even more highly syncopated, linear rhythmic complexity and a melodic angularity in which the blue note of the fifth degree was established as an important melodic-harmonic device.
* The reestablishment of the blues as the music&#x27;s primary organizing and functional principle.

Some of the harmonic innovations in bebop appear similar to innovations in Western &quot;serious&quot; music, from Claude Debussy to Arnold Schoenberg, although bebop has few direct borrowings from classical music and appears to largely revive tonal-harmonic ideas taken from the blues in a basically non-Western approach rooted in African traditions. However, bebop probably drew on many sources. An insightful YouTube video with Jimmy Raney, a jazz guitarist who played with Charlie Parker, describes how Parker would listen to the music of Béla Bartók, a leading 20th century classical composer. Raney describes Parker&#x27;s knowledge of Bartók and Arnold Schoenberg, in particular Schoenberg&#x27;s Pierrot Lunaire, and says that a section from Bartók&#x27;s Fifth Quartet sounded a lot like some of Parker&#x27;s jazz improvisation.

== History ==

===Swing era influences===
Bebop grew out of the culmination of trends that had been occurring within swing music since the mid-1930s: less explicit timekeeping by the drummer, with the primary rhythmic pulse moving from the bass drum to the ride cymbal; a changing role for the piano away from rhythmic density towards accents and fills; less ornate horn section arrangements, trending towards riffs and more support for the underlying rhythm; more emphasis on freedom for soloists; and increasing harmonic sophistication in arrangements used by some bands. The path towards rhythmically streamlined, solo-oriented swing was blazed by the territory bands of the southwest with Kansas City as their musical capital; their music was based on blues and other simple chord changes, riff-based in its approach to melodic lines and solo accompaniment, and expressing an approach adding melody and harmony to swing rather than the other way around. Ability to play sustained, high energy, and creative solos was highly valued for this newer style and the basis of intense competition. Swing-era jam sessions and &quot;cutting contests&quot; in Kansas City became legendary. The Kansas City approach to swing was epitomized by the Count Basie Orchestra, which came to national prominence in 1937.

One young admirer of the Basie orchestra in Kansas City was a teenage alto saxophone player named Charlie Parker. He was especially enthralled by their tenor saxophone player Lester Young, who played long flowing melodic lines that wove in and out of the chordal structure of the composition but somehow always made musical sense. Young was equally daring with his rhythm and phrasing as with his approach to harmonic structures in his solos. He would frequently repeat simple two or three note figures, with shifting rhythmic accents expressed by volume, articulation, or tone. His phrasing was far removed from the two or four bar phrases that horn players had used until then. They would often be extended to an odd number of measures, overlapping the musical stanzas suggested by the harmonic structure. He would take a breath in the middle of a phrase, using the pause, or &quot;free space&quot;, as a creative device. The overall effect was that his solos were something floating above the rest of the music, rather than something springing from it at intervals suggested by the ensemble sound. When the Basie orchestra burst onto the national scene with its 1937 recordings and widely broadcast New York engagements, it gained a national following, with legions of saxophone players striving to imitate Young, drummers striving to imitate Jo Jones, piano players striving to imitate Basie, and trumpet players striving to imitate Buck Clayton. Parker played along with the new Basie recordings on a Victrola until he could play Young&#x27;s solos note for note.

In the late 1930s the Duke Ellington Orchestra and the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra were exposing the music world to harmonically sophisticated musical arrangements by Billy Strayhorn and Sy Oliver, respectively, which implied chords as much as they spelled them out. That understatement of harmonically sophisticated chords would soon be used by young musicians exploring the new musical language of bebop.

The brilliant technique and harmonic sophistication of pianist Art Tatum inspired young musicians including Charlie Parker and Bud Powell. In his early days in New York, Parker held a job washing dishes at an establishment where Tatum had a regular gig.

One of the divergent trends of the swing era was a resurgence of small ensembles playing &quot;head&quot; arrangements, following the approach used with Basie&#x27;s big band. The small band format lent itself to more impromptu experimentation and more extended solos than did the bigger, more highly arranged bands. The 1939 recording of &quot;Body and Soul&quot; by Coleman Hawkins with a small band featured an extended saxophone solo with minimal reference to the theme that was unique in recorded jazz, and which would become characteristic of bebop. That solo showed a sophisticated harmonic exploration of the composition, with implied passing chords. Hawkins would eventually go on to lead the first formal recording of the bebop style in early 1944.
===Going beyond swing in New York===
As the 1930s turned to the 1940s, Parker went to New York as a featured player in the Jay McShann Orchestra. In New York he found other musicians who were exploring the harmonic and melodic limits of their music, including Dizzy Gillespie, a Roy Eldridge-influenced trumpet player who, like Parker, was exploring ideas based on upper chord intervals, beyond the seventh chords that had traditionally defined jazz harmony. While Gillespie was with Cab Calloway, he practiced with bassist Milt Hinton and developed some of the key harmonic and chordal innovations that would be the cornerstones of the new music; Parker did the same with bassist Gene Ramey while with McShann&#x27;s group. Guitarist Charlie Christian, who had arrived in New York in 1939 was, like Parker, an innovator extending a southwestern style. Christian&#x27;s major influence was in the realm of rhythmic phrasing. Christian commonly emphasized weak beats and off beats and often ended his phrases on the second half of the fourth beat. Christian experimented with asymmetrical phrasing, which was to become a core element of the new bop style.

Bud Powell was pushing forward with a rhythmically streamlined, harmonically sophisticated, virtuosic piano style and Thelonious Monk was adapting the new harmonic ideas to his style that was rooted in Harlem stride piano playing.

Drummers such as Kenny Clarke and Max Roach were extending the path set by Jo Jones, adding the ride cymbal to the high hat cymbal as a primary timekeeper and reserving the bass drum for accents. Bass drum accents were colloquially termed &quot;bombs&quot;, which referenced events in the world outside of New York as the new music was being developed. The new style of drumming supported and responded to soloists with accents and fills, almost like a shifting call and response. This change increased the importance of the string bass. Now, the bass not only maintained the music&#x27;s harmonic foundation, but also became responsible for establishing a metronomic rhythmic foundation by playing a &quot;walking&quot; bass line of four quarter notes to the bar. While small swing ensembles commonly functioned without a bassist, the new bop style required a bass in every small ensemble.

The kindred spirits developing the new music gravitated to sessions at Minton&#x27;s Playhouse, where Monk and Clarke were in the house band, and Monroe&#x27;s Uptown House, where Max Roach was in the house band. Part of the atmosphere created at jams like the ones found at Minton&#x27;s Playhouse was an air of exclusivity: the &quot;regular&quot; musicians would often reharmonize the standards, add complex rhythmic and phrasing devices into their melodies, or &quot;heads&quot;, and play them at breakneck tempos in order to exclude those whom they considered outsiders or simply weaker players. These pioneers of the new music (which would later be termed &quot;bebop&quot; or &quot;bop&quot;, although Parker himself never used the term, feeling it demeaned the music) began exploring advanced harmonies, complex syncopation, altered chords and chord substitutions. The bop musicians advanced these techniques with a more freewheeling, intricate and often arcane approach. Bop improvisers built upon the phrasing ideas first brought to attention by Lester Young&#x27;s soloing style. They would often deploy phrases over an odd number of bars and overlap their phrases across bar lines and across major harmonic cadences. Christian and the other early boppers would also begin stating a harmony in their improvised line before it appeared in the song form being outlined by the rhythm section. This momentary dissonance creates a strong sense of forward motion in the improvisation. The sessions also attracted top musicians in the swing idiom such as Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Ben Webster, Roy Eldridge, and Don Byas. Byas became the first tenor saxophone player to fully assimilate the new bebop style in his playing. In 1944 the crew of innovators was joined by Dexter Gordon, a tenor saxophone player from the west coast in New York with the Louis Armstrong band, and a young trumpet player attending the Juilliard School of Music, Miles Davis.

===Early recordings===
Bebop originated as &quot;musicians&#x27; music,&quot; played by musicians with other money-making gigs who did not care about the commercial potential of the new music. It did not attract the attention of major record labels nor was it intended to. Some of the early bebop was recorded informally. Some sessions at Minton&#x27;s in 1941 were recorded, with Thelonious Monk alongside an assortment of musicians including Joe Guy, Hot Lips Page, Roy Eldridge, Don Byas, and Charlie Christian. Christian is featured in recordings from May 12, 1941 (Esoteric ES 548). Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie were both participants at a recorded jam session hosted by Billy Eckstine on February 15, 1943, and Parker at another Eckstine jam session on February 28, 1943 (Stash ST-260; ST-CD-535).

Formal recording of bebop was first performed for small specialty labels, who were less concerned with mass-market appeal than the major labels, in 1944. On February 16, 1944, Coleman Hawkins led a session including Dizzy Gillespie and Don Byas, with a rhythm section consisting of Clyde Hart (piano), Oscar Pettiford (bass) and Max Roach (drums) that recorded &quot;Woody&#x27;n You&quot; (Apollo 751), the first formal recording of bebop. Charlie Parker and Clyde Hart were recorded in a quintet led by guitarist Tiny Grimes for the Savoy label on September 15, 1944 (&quot;Tiny&#x27;s Tempo, I&#x27;ll Always Love You Just the Same, Romance Without Finance, Red Cross&quot;). Hawkins led another bebop-influenced recording session on October 19, 1944, this time with Thelonious Monk on piano, Edward Robinson on bass, and Denzil Best on drums (&quot;On the Bean, Recollections, Flyin&#x27; Hawk, Driftin&#x27; on a Reed&quot;; reissue, Prestige PRCD-24124-2).

Parker, Gillespie, and others working the bebop idiom joined the Earl Hines Orchestra in 1943, then followed vocalist Billy Eckstine out of the band into the Billy Eckstine Orchestra in 1944. The Eckstine band was recorded on V-discs, which were broadcast over the Armed Forces Radio Network and gained popularity for the band showcasing the new bebop style. The format of the Eckstine band, featuring vocalists and entertaining banter, would later be emulated by Gillespie and others leading bebop-oriented big bands in a style that might be termed &quot;popular bebop&quot;. Starting with the Eckstine band&#x27;s session for the De Luxe label on December 5, 1944 (&quot;If That&#x27;s the Way You Feel, I Want to Talk About You, Blowing the Blues Away, Opus X, I&#x27;ll Wait and Pray, The Real Thing Happened to Me&quot;), bebop recording sessions grew more frequent. Parker had left the band by that date, but it still included Gillespie along with Dexter Gordon and Gene Ammons on tenor, Leo Parker on baritone, Tommy Potter on bass, Art Blakey on drums, and Sarah Vaughan on vocals. &quot;Blowing the Blues Away&quot; featured a tenor saxophone duel between Gordon and Ammons.

On January 4, 1945, Clyde Hart led a session including Parker, Gillespie, and Don Byas recorded for the Continental label (&quot;What&#x27;s the Matter Now, I Want Every Bit of It, That&#x27;s the Blues, G.I. Blues, Dream of You, Seventh Avenue, Sorta Kinda, Ooh Ooh, My My, Ooh Ooh&quot;). Gillespie recorded his first session as a leader on January 9, 1945, for the Manor label, with Don Byas on tenor, Trummy Young on trombone, Clyde Hart on Piano, Oscar Pettiford on bass, and Irv Kluger on drums. The session recorded &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Started, Good Bait, Be-bop (Dizzy&#x27;s Fingers)&quot;, and &quot;Salt Peanuts&quot; (which Manor wrongly named &quot;Salted Peanuts&quot;). Thereafter, Gillespie would record bebop prolifically and gain recognition as one of its leading figures. Gillespie featured Gordon as a sideman in a session recorded on February 9, 1945 for the Guild label (&quot;Groovin&#x27; High, Blue &#x27;n&#x27; Boogie&quot;). Parker appeared in Gillespie-led sessions dated February 28 (&quot;Groovin&#x27; High, All the Things You Are, Dizzy Atmosphere&quot;) and May 11, 1945 (&quot;Salt Peanuts, Shaw &#x27;Nuff, Lover Man, Hothouse&quot;) for the Guild label. Parker and Gillespie were sidemen with Sarah Vaughan on May 25, 1945, for the Continental label (&quot;What More Can a Woman Do, I&#x27;d Rather Have a Memory Than a Dream, Mean to Me&quot;). Parker and Gillespie appeared in a session under vibraphonist Red Norvo dated June 6, 1945, later released under the Dial label (&quot;Hallelujah, Get Happy, Slam Slam Blues, Congo Blues&quot;). Sir Charles Thompson&#x27;s all-star session of September 4, 1945 for the Apollo label (&quot;Takin&#x27; Off, If I Had You, Twentieth Century Blues, The Street Beat&quot;) featured Parker and Gordon. Gordon led his first session for the Savoy label on October 30, 1945, with Sadik Hakim (Argonne Thornton) on piano, Gene Ramey on bass, and Eddie Nicholson on drums (&quot;Blow Mr Dexter, Dexter&#x27;s Deck, Dexter&#x27;s Cuttin&#x27; Out, Dexter&#x27;s Minor Mad&quot;). Parker&#x27;s first session as a leader was on November 26, 1945, for the Savoy label, with Miles Davis and Gillespie on trumpet, Hakim/Thornton and Gillespie on piano, Curley Russell on bass and Max Roach on drums (&quot;Warming Up a Riff, Now&#x27;s the Time, Billie&#x27;s Bounce, Thriving on a Riff, Ko-Ko, Meandering&quot;). After appearing as a sideman in the R&amp;B-oriented Cootie Williams Orchestra through 1944, Bud Powell was in bebop sessions led by Frankie Socolow on May 2, 1945 for the Duke label (&quot;The Man I Love, Reverse the Charges, Blue Fantasy, September in the Rain&quot;), then Dexter Gordon on January 29, 1946 for the Savoy label (&quot;Long Tall Dexter, Dexter Rides Again, I Can&#x27;t Escape From You, Dexter Digs In&quot;). The growth of bebop through 1945 is also documented in informal live recordings.

===Breakout===
By 1946 bebop was established as a broad-based movement among New York jazz musicians, including trumpeters Fats Navarro and Kenny Dorham, trombonists J. J. Johnson and Kai Winding, alto saxophonist Sonny Stitt, tenor saxophonist James Moody, baritone saxophonists Leo Parker and Serge Chaloff, vibraphonist Milt Jackson, pianists Erroll Garner and Al Haig, bassist Slam Stewart, and others who would contribute to what would become known as &quot;modern jazz&quot;. The new music was gaining radio exposure with broadcasts such as those hosted by &quot;Symphony Sid&quot; Torin. Bebop was taking root in Los Angeles as well, among such modernists as trumpeters Howard McGhee and Art Farmer, alto players Sonny Criss and Frank Morgan, tenor players Teddy Edwards and Lucky Thompson, trombonist Melba Liston, pianists Dodo Marmarosa, Jimmy Bunn and Hampton Hawes, guitarist Barney Kessel, bassists Charles Mingus and Red Callender, and drummers Roy Porter and Connie Kay. Gillespie&#x27;s &quot;Rebop Six&quot; (with Parker on alto, Lucky Thompson on tenor, Al Haig on piano, Milt Jackson on vibes, Ray Brown on bass, and Stan Levey on drums) started an engagement in Los Angeles in December 1945. Parker and Thompson remained in Los Angeles after the rest of the band left, performing and recording together for six months before Parker suffered an addiction-related breakdown in July. Parker was again active in Los Angeles in early 1947. Parker and Thompson&#x27;s tenures in Los Angeles, the arrival of Dexter Gordon and Wardell Gray later in 1946, and the promotional efforts of Ross Russell, Norman Granz, and Gene Norman helped solidify the city&#x27;s status as a center of the new music.

Gillespie landed the first recording date with a major label for the new music, with the RCA Bluebird label recording Dizzy Gillespie And his Orchestra on February 22, 1946 (&quot;52nd Street Theme, A Night in Tunisia, Ol&#x27; Man Rebop, Anthropology&quot;). Later Afro-Cuban styled recordings for Bluebird in collaboration with Cuban &quot;rumberos&quot; Chano Pozo and Sabu Martinez, and arrangers Gil Fuller and George Russell (&quot;Manteca, Cubana Be, Cubana Bop, Guarache Guaro&quot;) would be among his most popular, giving rise to the Latin dance music craze of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Gillespie, with his extroverted personality and humor, glasses, lip beard and beret, would become the most visible symbol of the new music and new jazz culture in popular consciousness. That of course slighted the contributions of others with whom he had developed the music over the preceding years. His show style, influenced by black vaudeville circuit entertainers, seemed like a throwback to some and offended some purists (&quot;too much grinning&quot; according to Miles Davis), but it was laced with a subversive sense of humor that gave a glimpse of attitudes on racial matters that black musicians had previously kept away from the public at large. Before the Civil Rights Movement, Gillespie was confronting the racial divide by lampooning it. The intellectual subculture that surrounded bebop made it something of a sociological movement as well as a musical one.

With the imminent demise of the big swing bands, bebop had become the dynamic focus of the jazz world, with a broad-based &quot;progressive jazz&quot; movement seeking to emulate and adapt its devices. It was to be the most influential foundation of jazz for a generation of jazz musicians.

===Beyond===
By 1950, bebop musicians such as Clifford Brown and Sonny Stitt began to smooth out the rhythmic eccentricities of early bebop. Instead of using jagged phrasing to create rhythmic interest, as the early boppers had, these musicians constructed their improvised lines out of long strings of eighth notes and simply accented certain notes in the line to create rhythmic variety. The early 1950s also saw some smoothing in Charlie Parker&#x27;s style.

During the early 1950s bebop remained at the top of awareness of jazz, while its harmonic devices were adapted to the new &quot;cool&quot; school of jazz led by Miles Davis and others. It continued to attract young musicians such as Jackie McLean, Sonny Rollins, and John Coltrane. As musicians and composers began to work with expanded music theory during the mid-1950s, its adaptation by musicians who worked it into the basic dynamic approach of bebop would lead to the development of post-bop. Around that same time, a move towards structural simplification of bebop occurred among musicians such as Horace Silver and Art Blakey, leading to the movement known as hard bop. Development of jazz would occur through the interplay of bebop, cool, post-bop, and hard bop styles through the 1950s.

==Influence==
The musical devices developed with bebop were influential far beyond the bebop movement itself. &quot;Progressive jazz&quot; was a broad category of music that included bebop-influenced &quot;art music&quot; arrangements used by big bands such as those led by Boyd Raeburn, Charlie Ventura, Claude Thornhill, and Stan Kenton, and the cerebral harmonic explorations of smaller groups such as those led by pianists Lennie Tristano and Dave Brubeck. Voicing experiments based on bebop harmonic devices were used by Miles Davis and Gil Evans for the groundbreaking &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; sessions in 1949 and 1950. Musicians who followed the stylistic doors opened by Davis, Evans, Tristano, and Brubeck formed the core of the cool jazz and &quot;west coast jazz&quot; movements of the early 1950s.

By the mid-1950s musicians began to be influenced by music theory proposed by George Russell. Those who incorporated Russell&#x27;s ideas into the bebop foundation defined the post-bop movement that later incorporated modal jazz into its musical language.

Hard bop was a simplified derivative of bebop introduced by Horace Silver and Art Blakey in the mid-1950s. It became a major influence until the late 1960s when free jazz and fusion jazz gained ascendancy.

The neo-bop movement of the 1980s and 1990s revived the influence of bebop, post-bop, and hard bop styles after the free jazz and fusion eras.

Bebop style also influenced the Beat Generation whose spoken-word style drew on African-American &quot;jive&quot; dialog, jazz rhythms, and whose poets often employed jazz musicians to accompany them. Jack Kerouac would describe his writing in On the Road as a literary translation of the improvisations of Charlie Parker and Lester Young. The &quot;beatnik&quot; stereotype borrowed heavily from the dress and mannerisms of bebop musicians and followers, in particular the beret and lip beard of Dizzy Gillespie and the patter and bongo drumming of guitarist Slim Gaillard. The bebop subculture, defined as a non-conformist group expressing its values through musical communion, would echo in the attitude of the psychedelia-era hippies of the 1960s. Fans of bebop were not restricted to the United States; the music also gained cult status in France and Japan.

More recently, hip-hop artists (A Tribe Called Quest, Guru) have cited bebop as an influence on their rapping and rhythmic style. As early as 1983, Shawn Brown rapped the phrase &quot;Rebop, bebop, Scooby-Doo&quot; toward the end of the hit &quot;Rappin&#x27; Duke&quot;. Bassist Ron Carter collaborated with A Tribe Called Quest on 1991&#x27;s &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;, and vibraphonist Roy Ayers and trumpeter Donald Byrd were featured on &quot;Guru&#x27;s Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1&quot; in 1993. Bebop samples, especially bass lines, ride cymbal swing clips, and horn and piano riffs are found throughout the hip-hop compendium.

<text>A fossil fuel is a carbon compound- or hydrocarbon-containing material formed naturally in the Earth&#x27;s crust from the buried remains of prehistoric organisms (animals, plants or planktons), a process that occurs within geological formations. Reservoirs of such compound mixtures, such as coal, petroleum and natural gas, can be extracted and burnt as fuel for human consumption to provide energy for direct use (such as for cooking, heating or lighting), to power heat engines (such as steam or internal combustion engines) that can propel vehicles, or to generate electricity via steam turbine generators. Some fossil fuels are further refined into derivatives such as kerosene, gasoline and diesel, or converted into petrochemicals such as polyolefins (plastics), aromatics and synthetic resins.

The origin of fossil fuels is the anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms. The conversion from these organic materials to high-carbon fossil fuels typically requires a geological process of millions of years. Due to the length of time it takes for them to form, fossil fuels are considered non-renewable resources.

In 2022, over 80% of primary energy consumption in the world and over 60% of its electricity supply were from fossil fuels. The large-scale burning of fossil fuels causes serious environmental damage. Over 70% of the greenhouse gas emissions due to human activity in 2022 was carbon dioxide () released from burning fossil fuels. Natural carbon cycle processes on Earth, mostly absorption by the ocean, can remove only a small part of this, and terrestrial vegetation loss due to deforestation, land degradation and desertification further compounds this deficiency. Therefore, there is a net increase of many billion tonnes of atmospheric per year. Although methane leaks are significant, the burning of fossil fuels is the main source of greenhouse gas emissions causing global warming and ocean acidification. Additionally, most air pollution deaths are due to fossil fuel particulates and noxious gases, and it is estimated that this costs over 3% of the global gross domestic product and that fossil fuel phase-out will save millions of lives each year.

Recognition of the climate crisis, pollution and other negative impacts caused by fossil fuels has led to a widespread policy transition and activist movement focused on ending their use in favor of renewable and sustainable energy. Because the fossil-fuel industry is so heavily integrated in the global economy and heavily subsidized, this transition is expected to have significant economic impacts. Many stakeholders argue that this change needs to be a just transition and create policy that addresses the societal burdens created by the stranded assets of the fossil fuel industry. International policy, in the form of United Nations&#x27; sustainable development goals for affordable and clean energy and climate action, as well as the Paris Climate Agreement, is designed to facilitate this transition at a global level. In 2021, the International Energy Agency concluded that no new fossil fuel extraction projects could be opened if the global economy and society wants to avoid the worst impacts of climate change and meet international goals for climate change mitigation.

==Origin==
The theory that fossil fuels formed from the fossilized remains of dead plants by exposure to heat and pressure in Earth&#x27;s crust over millions of years was first introduced by Andreas Libavius &quot;in his 1597 Alchemia [Alchymia]&quot; and later by Mikhail Lomonosov &quot;as early as 1757 and certainly by 1763&quot;. The first recorded use of the term &quot;fossil fuel&quot; occurs in the work of the German chemist Caspar Neumann, in English translation in 1759. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; notes that in the phrase &quot;fossil fuel&quot; the adjective &quot;fossil&quot; means &quot;[o]btained by digging; found buried in the earth&quot;, which dates to at least 1652, before the English noun &quot;fossil&quot; came to refer primarily to long-dead organisms in the early 18th century.

Aquatic phytoplankton and zooplankton that died and sedimented in large quantities under anoxic conditions millions of years ago began forming petroleum and natural gas as a result of anaerobic decomposition. Over geological time this organic matter, mixed with mud, became buried under further heavy layers of inorganic sediment. The resulting high temperature and pressure caused the organic matter to chemically alter, first into a waxy material known as kerogen, which is found in oil shales, and then with more heat into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons in a process known as catagenesis. Despite these heat-driven transformations, the energy released in combustion is still photosynthetic in origin.

Terrestrial plants tended to form coal and methane. Many of the coal fields date to the Carboniferous period of Earth&#x27;s history. Terrestrial plants also form type III kerogen, a source of natural gas. Although fossil fuels are continually formed by natural processes, they are classified as non-renewable resources because they take millions of years to form and known viable reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are generated.

==Importance==

Fossil fuels have been important to human development because they can be readily burned in the open atmosphere to produce heat. The use of peat as a domestic fuel predates recorded history. Coal was burned in some early furnaces for the smelting of metal ore, while semi-solid hydrocarbons from oil seeps were also burned in ancient times, they were mostly used for waterproofing and embalming.

Commercial exploitation of petroleum began in the 19th century.

Natural gas, once flared-off as an unneeded byproduct of petroleum production, is now considered a very valuable resource. Natural gas deposits are also the main source of helium.

Heavy crude oil, which is much more viscous than conventional crude oil, and oil sands, where bitumen is found mixed with sand and clay, began to become more important as sources of fossil fuel in the early 2000s. Oil shale and similar materials are sedimentary rocks containing kerogen, a complex mixture of high-molecular weight organic compounds, which yield synthetic crude oil when heated (pyrolyzed). With additional processing, they can be employed instead of other established fossil fuels. During the 2010s and 2020s there was disinvestment from exploitation of such resources due to their high carbon cost relative to more easily-processed reserves.

Prior to the latter half of the 18th century, windmills and watermills provided the energy needed for work such as milling flour, sawing wood or pumping water, while burning wood or peat provided domestic heat. The wide-scale use of fossil fuels, coal at first and petroleum later, in steam engines enabled the Industrial Revolution. At the same time, gas lights using natural gas or coal gas were coming into wide use. The invention of the internal combustion engine and its use in automobiles and trucks greatly increased the demand for gasoline and diesel oil, both made from fossil fuels. Other forms of transportation, railways and aircraft, also require fossil fuels. The other major use for fossil fuels is in generating electricity and as feedstock for the petrochemical industry. Tar, a leftover of petroleum extraction, is used in the construction of roads.

The energy for the Green Revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers (natural gas), pesticides (oil), and hydrocarbon-fueled irrigation. The development of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer has significantly supported global population growth; it has been estimated that almost half of the Earth&#x27;s population are currently fed as a result of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use. According to head of a fertilizers commodity price agency, &quot;50% of the world&#x27;s food relies on fertilisers.&quot;

==Environmental effects==


The burning of fossil fuels has a number of negative externalitiesharmful environmental impacts where the effects extend beyond the people using the fuel. These effects vary between different fuels. All fossil fuels release when they burn, thus accelerating climate change. Burning coal, and to a lesser extent oil and its derivatives, contributes to atmospheric particulate matter, smog and acid rain.
Air pollution from fossil fuels in 2018 has been estimated to cost US$2.9 trillion, or 3.3% of the global gross domestic product (GDP).

Climate change is largely driven by the release of greenhouse gases like , and the burning of fossil fuels is the main source of these emissions. In most parts of the world climate change is negatively impacting ecosystems. This includes contributing to the extinction of species and reducing people&#x27;s ability to produce food, thus adding to the problem of world hunger. Continued rises in global temperatures will lead to further adverse effects on both ecosystems and people; the World Health Organization has said that climate change is the greatest threat to human health in the 21st century.

Combustion of fossil fuels generates sulfuric and nitric acids, which fall to Earth as acid rain, impacting both natural areas and the built environment. Monuments and sculptures made from marble and limestone are particularly vulnerable, as the acids dissolve calcium carbonate.

Fossil fuels also contain radioactive materials, mainly uranium and thorium, which are released into the atmosphere. In 2000, about 12,000 tonnes of thorium and 5,000 tonnes of uranium were released worldwide from burning coal. It is estimated that during 1982, US coal burning released 155 times as much radioactivity into the atmosphere as the Three Mile Island accident.

Burning coal also generates large amounts of bottom ash and fly ash. These materials are used in a wide variety of applications (see Fly ash reuse), utilizing, for example, about 40% of the United States production.

In addition to the effects that result from burning, the harvesting, processing, and distribution of fossil fuels also have environmental effects. Coal mining methods, particularly mountaintop removal and strip mining, have negative environmental impacts, and offshore oil drilling poses a hazard to aquatic organisms. Fossil fuel wells can contribute to methane release via fugitive gas emissions. Oil refineries also have negative environmental impacts, including air and water pollution. Coal is sometimes transported by diesel-powered locomotives, while crude oil is typically transported by tanker ships, requiring the combustion of additional fossil fuels.

A variety of mitigating efforts have arisen to counter the negative effects of fossil fuels. This includes a movement to use alternative energy sources, such as renewable energy. Environmental regulation uses a variety of approaches to limit these emissions; for example, rules against releasing waste products like fly ash into the atmosphere.

In December 2020, the United Nations released a report saying that despite the need to reduce greenhouse emissions, various governments are &quot;doubling down&quot; on fossil fuels, in some cases diverting over 50% of their COVID-19 recovery stimulus funding to fossil fuel production rather than to alternative energy. The UN secretary general António Guterres declared that &quot;Humanity is waging war on nature. This is suicidal. Nature always strikes backand it is already doing so with growing force and fury.&quot; He also claimed there is still cause for hope, anticipating the US plan to join other large emitters like China and the EU in adopting targets to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

==Inflation effects==
Fossilflation is a term that describes the impact of fossil fuels on inflation.

According to &quot;Vox&quot; in August 2022&quot;,&quot; &quot;Economists have pointed to energy prices as the main reason for high inflation,&quot; noting that &quot;energy prices indirectly affect virtually every part of the economy&quot;. Sectors that raise prices significantly as a result of higher fossil fuel prices include transportation, food, and shipping.

=== History ===
Mark Zandi of &quot;Moody&#x27;s&quot; says that fossil fuel prices have driven every big episode of inflation since WWII.

The economic impact of the Russian Invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was a major recent example of fossil fuels causing inflation. Some economists, including Isabel Schnabel, believe that dependence on fossil fuels is the main driver of the 2021-2022 inflation spike.

=== Efforts to combat fossilflation ===
Gernot Wagner argues that commodities are undesirable energy sources because they are susceptible to volatile price swings that technologies like renewable energy are not. He also argues that technologies improve and get relatively cheaper over time. Coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, some argued for the possibility of a base effect phenomenon due to cheaper than normal prices, such as for oil, at the onset of the pandemic, followed by above-average prices which exacerbated the perceived inflation.

=== Inflation Reduction Act ===
While not expected to provide much short-term relief, the Inflation Reduction Act seeks to make the United States less dependent on fossil fuels and their ability to cause inflation in the economy. Moody&#x27;s estimates that by 2030, the bill could reduce the typical American household&#x27;s spending on energy by more than $300 each year, in 2022 dollars.

==Illness and deaths==
Environmental pollution from fossil fuels impacts humans because particulates and other air pollution from fossil fuel combustion may cause illness and death when inhaled. These health effects include premature death, acute respiratory illness, aggravated asthma, chronic bronchitis and decreased lung function. The poor, undernourished, very young and very old, and people with preexisting respiratory disease and other ill health are more at risk. Global air pollution deaths due to fossil fuels have been estimated at over 8 million people (2018, nearly 1 in 5 deaths worldwide) at 10.2 million (2019), and 5.13 million excess deaths from ambient air pollution from fossil fuel use (2023).

While all energy sources inherently have adverse effects, the data show that fossil fuels cause the highest levels of greenhouse gas emissions and are the most dangerous for human health. In contrast, modern renewable energy sources appear to be safer for human health and cleaner. The death rates from accidents and air pollution in the EU are as follows per terawatt-hour (TWh):
 As the data shows, coal, oil, natural gas, and biomass cause higher death rates and higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions than hydropower, nuclear energy, wind, and solar power. Scientists propose that 1.8 million lives have been saved by replacing fossil fuel sources with nuclear power.

==Phase-out==

=== Just transition ===
=== Divestment ===
==Industrial sector==

In 2019, Saudi Aramco was listed and it reached a US$2 trillion valuation on its second day of trading, after the world&#x27;s largest initial public offering.

<text>Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that generally reflects a challenging or avant-garde approach to rock, or which makes use of modernist, experimental, or unconventional elements. Art rock aspires to elevate rock from entertainment to an artistic statement, opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Influences may be drawn from genres such as experimental music, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz.

Art rock was created with the intention of listening and contemplation rather than for dancing, and is often distinguished by the use of electronic effects and easy listening textures far removed from the propulsive rhythms of early rock. The term may sometimes be used interchangeably with &quot;progressive rock&quot;, though the latter is instead characterised in particular by its employment of classically trained instrumental technique and symphonic textures.

The music, as well as the theatrical nature of performances associated with the genre, was able to appeal to artistically inclined adolescents and younger adults, especially due to its virtuosity and musical/lyrical complexity. Art rock is most associated with a certain period of rock music, beginning in 1966–67 and ending with the arrival of punk rock in the mid-1970s. After, the genre would be infused within later popular music genres of the 1970s–90s.

==Definitions==

Critic John Rockwell says that art rock is one of rock&#x27;s most wide-ranging and eclectic genres with its overt sense of creative detachment, classical music pretensions, and experimental, avant-garde proclivities. In the rock music of the 1970s, the &quot;art&quot; descriptor was generally understood to mean &quot;aggressively avant-garde&quot; or &quot;pretentiously progressive&quot;. &quot;Art rock&quot; is often used synonymously with progressive rock. Historically, the term has been used to describe at least two related, but distinct, types of rock music. The first is progressive rock, while the second usage refers to groups who rejected psychedelia and the hippie counterculture in favour of a modernist, avant-garde approach defined by the Velvet Underground. Essayist Ellen Willis compared these two types:

Art rock emphasises Romantic and autonomous traditions, in distinction to the aesthetic of the everyday and the disposable embodied by art pop. Larry Starr and Christopher Waterman&#x27;s &quot;American Popular Music&quot; defines art rock as a &quot;form of rock music that blended elements of rock and European classical music&quot;, citing the English rock bands King Crimson, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, and Pink Floyd as examples. Common characteristics include album-oriented music divided into compositions rather than songs, with usually complicated and long instrumental sections and symphonic orchestration. Its music was traditionally used within the context of concept records, and its lyrical themes tended to be &quot;imaginative&quot; and politically oriented.

Differences have been identified between art rock and progressive rock, with art rock emphasising avant-garde or experimental influences and &quot;novel sonic structure&quot;, while progressive rock has been characterised as putting a greater emphasis on classically trained instrumental technique, literary content, and symphonic features. Compared to progressive rock, art rock is &quot;more challenging, noisy and unconventional&quot; and &quot;less classically influenced&quot;, with more of an emphasis on avant-garde music. Similarities are that they both describe a mostly British attempt to elevate rock music to new levels of artistic credibility, and became the instrumental analogue to concept albums and rock operas, which were typically more vocal oriented.

Art rock can also refer to either classically driven rock, or to a progressive rock-folk fusion. Bruce Eder&#x27;s essay &quot;The Early History of Art-Rock/Prog Rock&quot; states that progressive rock,&#x27; also sometimes known as &#x27;art rock,&#x27; or &#x27;classical rock is music in which the &quot;bands [are] playing suites, not songs; borrowing riffs from Bach, Beethoven, and Wagner instead of Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley; and using language closer to William Blake or T. S. Eliot than to Carl Perkins or Willie Dixon.&quot;

==History==
===1960s===

====Background====


The boundaries between art and pop music became increasingly blurred throughout the second half of the 20th century. The first usage of the term &quot;art rock&quot;, according to Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, was in 1968. As pop music&#x27;s dominant format transitioned from singles to albums, many rock bands created works that aspired to make grand artistic statements, where art rock would flourish. As it progressed in the late 1960s – in tandem with the development of progressive rock – art rock acquired notoriety alongside experimental rock.

====Proponents====
The earliest figure of art rock has been assumed to be record producer and songwriter Phil Spector, who became known as an auteur for his Wall of Sound productions that aspired to a &quot;classical grandiosity&quot;. According to biographer Richard Williams: &quot;[Spector] created a new concept: the producer as the overall director of the creative process, from beginning to end. He took control of everything, he picked the artists, wrote or chose the material, supervised the arrangements, told the singers how to phrase, masterminded all phases of the recording process with the most painful attention to detail, and released the result on his own label.&quot; Williams also says that Spector transformed rock music from a performing art into an art that could only exist in the recording studio, which &quot;paved the way for art rock&quot;.

The Beach Boys&#x27; leader Brian Wilson is also cited as one of the first examples of the auteur music producer. Like Spector, Wilson was known as a reclusive studio obsessive who laboriously produced fantastical soundscapes through his mastery of recording technology. Biographer Peter Ames Carlin wrote that Wilson was the forerunner of &quot;a new kind of art-rock that would combine the transcendent possibilities of art with the mainstream accessibility of pop music&quot;. Drawing from the influence of Wilson&#x27;s work and the work of the Beatles&#x27; producer George Martin, music producers after the mid 1960s began to view the recording studio as a musical instrument used to aid the process of composition. Critic Stephen Holden says that mid-1960s recordings by the Beatles, Spector and Wilson are often identified as marking the start of art pop, which preceded the &quot;bombastic, classically inflected&quot; art rock that started in the late 1960s.

Many of the top British groups during the 1960s – including members of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, the Who, 10cc, the Move, the Yardbirds and Pink Floyd – came to music via art school. This institution differed from its US counterpart in terms of having a less industry-applicable syllabus and in its focus on furthering eccentric talent. By the mid-1960s, several of these acts espoused an approach based on art and originality, where previously they had been absorbed solely in authentic interpretation of US-derived musical styles, such as rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and R&amp;B.

According to journalist Richard Goldstein, many popular musicians from California (like Wilson) desired to be acknowledged as artists, and struggled with this aspiration. Goldstein says that the line between violating musical conventions and making &quot;truly popular music&quot; caused those who did not have &quot;strong enough egos&quot; (in contrast to Bob Dylan and the Beatles) to be &quot;doomed to a respectful rejection, and a few albums with disappointing sales usually meant silence. ... They yearned for fame, as only needy people can, but they also wanted to make art, and when both of those impulses couldn&#x27;t be achieved they recoiled in a ball of frantic confusion.&quot;

Author Matthew Bannister traces &quot;the more self-conscious, camp aesthetic of art rock&quot; to pop artist Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground, who emulated Warhol&#x27;s art/pop synthesis. Accordingly: &quot;Warhol took Spector&#x27;s combination of the disembodiment, &#x27;distance&#x27; and refinement of high culture with the &#x27;immediacy&#x27; of mass cultural forms like rock and roll several stages further ... But Warhol&#x27;s aesthetic was more thoroughly worked out than Spector&#x27;s, which represented a transitional phase between old-fashioned auteurism and the thoroughly postmodern, detached tenets of pop art. ... Warhol&#x27;s approach reverberates throughout art rock, most obviously in his stance of distance and disengagement.&quot; In 1969, the Doors also explored art rock genre on their fourth album, &quot;The Soft Parade&quot;.

====Influential albums====
=====1965–66=====
The December 1965 release of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; signified a watershed for the pop album, transforming it in scope from a collection of singles with lesser-quality tracks to a distinct art form, filled with high-quality original compositions. The album garnered recognition for the Beatles as artists from the American mainstream press, anticipating rock music&#x27;s cultural legitimisation as an art form. Writing in 1968, Gene Sculatti of &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot; recognised &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; as &quot;the definitive &#x27;rock as art&#x27; album&quot; and &quot;the necessary prototype&quot; that major artists such as the Rolling Stones (with &quot;Aftermath&quot;) and the Beach Boys had felt compelled to follow.

The period when rock music became most closely aligned with art began in 1966 and continued until the mid 1970s. Academic Michael Johnson associates &quot;the first documented moments of ascension in rock music&quot; to the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967). Released in May 1966, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; came from Wilson&#x27;s desire to make a &quot;complete statement&quot;, as he believed the Beatles had previously done with &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. In 1978, biographer David Leaf wrote that the album heralded art rock, while according to &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, &quot;&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; proved that a pop group could make an album-length piece comparable with the greatest long-form works of Bernstein, Copland, Ives, and Rodgers and Hammerstein.&quot; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; is also noted as the first rock concept album. In 1971, &quot;Cue&quot; magazine described the Beach Boys as having been &quot;among the vanguard&quot; with regard to art rock, among many other aspects relating to the counterculture, over the period up to late 1967.

Jacqueline Edmondson&#x27;s 2013 encyclopaedia &quot;Music in American Life&quot; states that, although it was preceded by earlier examples, Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention&#x27;s debut album &quot;Freak Out!&quot; (June 1966) came to be seen as &quot;the first successful incorporation of art music in a pop context&quot;. With Los Angeles as his base since the early 1960s, Zappa was able to work in an environment where student radicalism was closely aligned with an active avant-garde scene, a setting that placed the city ahead of other countercultural centres at the time and would continue to inform his music. Writer and pianist Michael Campbell comments that the album &quot;contains a long noncategorical list of Zappa&#x27;s influences, from classical avant-garde composers to obscure folk musicians&quot;.

The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolver&quot; (August 1966) furthered the album-as-art perspective and continued pop music&#x27;s evolution. Led by the art-rock single &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, it expanded the genre&#x27;s scope in terms of the range of musical styles, which included Indian, avant-garde and classical, and the lyrical content of the album, and also in its departure from previous notions of melody and structure in pop songwriting. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;&quot;Revolver&quot; signaled that in popular music, anything – any theme, any musical idea – could now be realized.&quot; As with &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, the album inspired many of the progressive rock artists of the 1970s, and each of its songs has been recognised as anticipating a new subgenre or style.

&quot;Clash Music&quot; names the Velvet Underground&#x27;s debut March 1967 album &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; &quot;the original art-rock record&quot;. Bannister writes of the Velvet Underground: &quot;no other band exerted the same grip on the minds of 1970s/1980s art/alternative rock artists, writers and audiences.&quot; Their influence would recur from the 1970s onwards to various worldwide indie scenes, and in 2006, &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; was inducted into the Library of Congress&#x27; National Recording Registry, who commented: &quot;For decades [it] has cast a huge shadow over nearly every sub-variety of avant-garde rock, from 70s art-rock to no-wave, new-wave, and punk.&quot; However, when the Velvet Underground first appeared in the mid 1960s, they faced rejection and were commonly dismissed as a &quot;fag&quot; band. In 1982, musician Brian Eno famously stated that while &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; initially sold just 30,000 copies, &quot;everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band.&quot;

The Beatles&#x27; Paul McCartney deemed &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; &quot;the record of the time&quot;, and in June 1967, the band responded with their own album: &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s&quot;, which was also influenced by &quot;Freak Out!&quot; AllMusic states that the first wave of art rock musicians were inspired by &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s&quot; and believed that for rock music to grow artistically, they should incorporate elements of European and classical music to the genre. Many British groups flowered in the album&#x27;s wake; those who are listed in &quot;Music in American Life&quot; include the Moody Blues, the Strawbs, Genesis, and &quot;most notably&quot;, Pink Floyd. The band&#x27;s bassist, Roger Waters later stated that both &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; and &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; &quot;completely changed everything about records&quot; for him.

===1970s–1990s===

Art rock&#x27;s greatest level of popularity was in the early 1970s through British artists including King Crimson and Queen.
Early in the decade, Pink Floyd released &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;, with the 23-minute title track taking up the entire first side of the LP. This experiment with collaborator Ron Geesin yielded the longest unbroken Pink Floyd song on record, a suite divided into six parts, which required the band at times to utilise a choir and brass section on tour. The album was a commercial success, giving the band to its first number one record in the UK. It signalled a shift in their music from the psychedelic forays of their late &#x27;60s albums and into a period of renewed creativity in the form of longer and more progressive rock music.

Enthusiasm for art rock explorations waned in the mid 1970s. From then to the 1990s, art rock was infused within various popular music genres. &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; states that its genre&#x27;s tendencies were continued by some British and American hard rock and pop rock artists, and that Brian Eno&#x27;s late 1970s and early 1980s collaborations with David Bowie and Talking Heads are exemplary of &quot;the successful infusion of art rock tendencies into other popular music genres&quot;. Bowie and Eno collaborated on a series of consecutive albums called the &quot;Berlin Trilogy&quot;, characterised as an &quot;art rock trifecta&quot; by &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot;, who noted that at the time of their release, &quot;The experimental records weren&#x27;t connecting with audiences on the scale Bowie was used to. ... New Wave had exploded, and a generation of Bowie descendants had taken the stage.&quot;

In the 1980s, a new generation of English art rockers took the place of 1970s bands such as Roxy Music, Yes, Genesis, Jethro Tull and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. Journalist Roy Trakin said in 1981: &quot;Of course, these stalwarts can still fill Madison Square Garden and sell a great many records, as they always have, but their days of adventurous risk-taking and musical innovation are long gone – replaced by the smug satisfaction of commercial success.&quot;

In the early 1980s, the art rock genre influenced the emerging post-punk and new wave movements, as bands incorporated experimental and avant-garde elements that were hallmarks of art rock. Groups such as Talking Heads and Roxy Music utilized art rock’s emphasis on artistic expression and experimental sounds to push boundaries within popular music. Notably, Roxy Music&#x27;s use of synthesizers and visual aesthetics, influenced by art rock, became central to their identity and inspired later genres, including synth-pop and new wave.

<doc id="48152" wikidata="Q1470163" url="?curid=48152" title="Commodity money">
<text>Commodity money is money whose value comes from a commodity of which it is made. Commodity money consists of objects having value or use in themselves (intrinsic value) as well as their value in buying goods.
This is in contrast to representative money, which has no intrinsic value but represents something of value such as gold or silver, for which it can be exchanged, and fiat money, which derives its value from having been established as money by government regulation.

Examples of commodities that have been used as media of exchange include precious metals and stones, grain, animal parts (such as beaver pelts), tobacco, fuel, and others. Sometimes several types of commodity money were used together, with fixed relative values, in various commodity valuation or price system economies.

== Aspects ==

Commodity money is to be distinguished from representative money, which is a certificate or token which can be exchanged for the underlying commodity, but only by a formal process. A key feature of commodity money is that the value is directly perceived by its users, who recognize the utility or beauty of the tokens as goods in themselves. Since payment by commodity generally provides a useful good, commodity money is similar to barter, but is distinguishable from it in having a single recognized unit of exchange. Radford (1945) described the establishment of commodity money in P.O.W camps.

Radford documented the way that this &#x27;cigarette currency&#x27; was subject to Gresham&#x27;s law, inflation, and especially deflation.

In another example, in US prisons after smoking was banned circa 2003, commodity money has switched in many places to containers of mackerel fish fillets, which have a fairly standard cost and are easy to store. These may be exchanged for many services in prisons where currency is prohibited.

=== Metals ===
In metallic currencies, a government mint will coin money by placing a mark on metal tokens, typically gold or silver, which serves as a guarantee of their weight and purity. In issuing this coinage at a face value higher than its costs, the government gains a profit known as seigniorage.

The role of a mint and of coin differs between commodity money and fiat money. In commodity money, the coin retains its value if it is melted and physically altered, while in a fiat money it does not. Usually, in a fiat money the value drops if the coin is converted to metal, but in a few cases the value of metals in fiat moneys have been allowed to rise to values larger than the face value of the coin. In India, for example, fiat Rupees disappeared from the market after 2007 when their content of stainless steel became larger than the fiat or face value of the coins. In the US, the metal in pennies (97.5% zinc since 1982, 95% copper in 1982 and before) and nickels (75% copper, 25% nickel) has a value close to, and sometimes exceeding, the fiat face value of the coin.

== History ==
Commodities often come into being in situations where other forms of money are not available or not trusted, and these are social norms.
Various commodities were used in pre-Revolutionary America including wampum (shell beads), maize (corn), iron nails, beaver pelts, and tobacco.

In Canada, where the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and other fur trading companies controlled most of the country, fur traders quickly realized that gold and silver were of no interest to the First Nations. They wanted goods such as metal knives and axes. Rather than use a barter system, the fur traders established the made beaver (representing a single beaver pelt) as the standard currency, and created a price list for goods:

* 5 pounds of sugar cost 1 beaver pelt
* 2 scissors cost 1 beaver pelt
* 20 fish hooks cost 1 beaver pelt
* 1 pair of shoes cost 1 beaver pelt
* 1 gun cost 12 beaver pelts

Other animal furs were convertible into beaver pelts at a standard rate as well, so this created a viable currency in an economy where precious metals were not valued. However, for convenience, Hudson&#x27;s Bay post managers exchanged made beaver coins, which were stamped pieces of copper or brass.

Long after gold coins became rare in commerce, the Fort Knox gold repository of the United States functioned as a theoretical backing for Federal Reserve. Between 1933 and 1970 (when the U.S. officially left the gold standard), one U.S. dollar was technically worth exactly 1/35 of a troy ounce (889 mg) of gold. However, actual trade in gold bullion as a precious metal within the United States was banned after 1933, with the explicit purpose of preventing the &quot;hoarding&quot; of private gold during an economic depression period in which maximal circulation of money was desired by government policy. This was a fairly typical transition from commodity to representative to fiat money, with people trading in other goods being forced to trade in gold, then to receive paper money that purported to be &quot;as good as gold,&quot; and finally a fiat currency backed by government authority and social perceptions of value.

Cigarettes and gasoline were used as a form of commodity money in some parts of Europe, including Germany, France and Belgium, in the immediate aftermath of World War II. They have continued to be used as currency in war-torn locations experiencing inadequate supply of common goods and monetary collapse, such as during the Siege of Sarajevo in 1993 or in Russian-occupied Kherson in 2022.

== Functions ==
Although grains such as barley have been used historically in relations of trade and barter (Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC), they can be inconvenient as a medium of exchange or a standard of deferred payment due to transport and storage concerns and eventual spoilage. Gold or other metals are sometimes used in a price system as a durable, easily warehoused store of value (demurrage).

The use of barter-like methods using commodity money may date back to at least 100,000 years ago. Trading in red ochre is attested in Eswatini, shell jewellery in the form of strung beads also dates back to this period, and had the basic attributes needed of commodity money. To organize production and to distribute goods and services among their populations, before market economies existed, people relied on tradition, top-down command, or community cooperation. Relations of reciprocity, and/or redistribution, substituted for market exchange.

The city-states of Sumer developed a trade and market economy based originally on the commodity money of the Shekel, which was a certain weight measure of barley, while the Babylonians and their city-state neighbors later developed the earliest system of economics using a metric of various commodities, that was fixed in a legal code.

Several centuries after the invention of cuneiform script, the use of writing expanded beyond debt/payment certificates and inventory lists to codified amounts of commodity money being used in contract law, such as buying property and paying legal fines.

== Legal tender issues ==
Today, the face value of specie and base-metal coins is set by government fiat, and it is only this value which must be legally accepted as payment for debt, in the jurisdiction of the government which declares the coin to be legal tender. The value of the precious metal in the coin may give it another value, but this varies over time. The value of the metal is subject to bilateral agreement, just as is the case with pure metals or commodities which had not been monetized by any government. As an example, gold and silver coins from other non-U.S. countries are specifically exempted in U.S. law from being legal tender for the payment of debts in the United States, so that a seller who refuses to accept them cannot be sued by the payer who offers them to settle a debt. However, nothing prevents such arrangements from being made if both parties agree on a value for the coins.

<text>Marion Franklin Tinsley (February 3, 1927 – April 3, 1995) was an American mathematician and checkers player. He is widely considered to be the greatest checkers player ever. Tinsley was world champion from 1955–1958 and from 1975–1991 and never lost a world championship match. He lost only seven games (two of them to the Chinook computer program, one of them while competing drunk and one in a simultaneous exhibition) from 1950 until his death in 1995. He withdrew from championship play during the years 1958–1975, relinquishing the title during that time. Derek Oldbury, sometimes considered the second-best player of all time, thought that Tinsley was &quot;to checkers what Leonardo da Vinci was to science, what Michelangelo was to art and what Beethoven was to music.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Tinsley was born in Ironton, Ohio, but spent his early life in Greenup County. Tinsley was the son of a school teacher and a farmer who became a sheriff. He had a sister and &quot;felt unloved&quot; by his parents. To gain the affection of his parents, he competed in math and spelling bees as a child. He said of his parents&#x27; disapproval: &quot;And as a twig is bent, it grows: As I grew up, I still kept feeling that way.&quot;

He skipped four of his first eight grades. He graduated from a Columbus high school at fifteen. Tinsley had a doctorate from Ohio State University in the mathematical discipline of combinatorial analysis. He worked as a professor of mathematics at Florida State University and Florida A&amp;M University. Tinsley once claimed to have spent approximately 10,000 hours studying checkers while in graduate school. Tinsley also served as a lay preacher in the Disciples of Christ church.

== Checkers career ==
After reading a book by Millard Hopper, Tinsley became interested in the game.

Tinsley enlisted in the Navy in 1945 and was stationed at Gulfport, Mississippi, where he won the Southern Louisiana Open. In 1946, he finished second behind William F. Ryan at the Newark National Tourney, losing the finals 2–1–11. Tinsley won four Ohio State Opens (1946, 1947, 1948, 1949), six Cedar Point Tourneys (1946, 1949, 1950, 1951 and 1952), and two Canadian Opens (1949 and 1950).

Tinsley was an eight-time three-move world champion (1954, 1955, 1958, 1979, 1981, 1985, 1987 and 1989) and once in two-move checkers (1952).

His 1951–1995 tournament record, excluding the Chinook games:
==Chinook games==
Tinsley retired from championship play in 1991. In August 1992, he defeated the Chinook computer program 4–2 (with 33 draws) in a match. Chinook had placed second at the U.S. Nationals in 1990 after Tinsley, which usually qualifies one to compete for the World Championships. However, the American Checkers Federation and the English Draughts Association refused to allow a computer to play for the title. Unable to appeal their decision, Tinsley resigned his title as World Champion and immediately indicated his desire to play against Chinook. The unofficial yet highly publicized match was quickly organized, and was won by Tinsley.

In one game from their match in 1990, Chinook, playing with white pieces, made a mistake on the tenth move. Tinsley remarked, &quot;You&#x27;re going to regret that.&quot; Chinook resigned after move 36, only 26 moves later. The lead programmer Jonathan Schaeffer looked back into the database and discovered that Tinsley picked the only strategy that could have defeated Chinook from that point and Tinsley was able to see the win 64 moves into the future.

The ACF and the EDA were placed in the awkward position of naming a new world champion, a title which would be worthless as long as Tinsley was alive. The ACF granted Tinsley the title of World Champion Emeritus as a solution.

In August 1994, a second match with Chinook was organized, but Tinsley withdrew after only six games (all draws) for health reasons. Don Lafferty, rated the number two player in the world at the time, replaced Tinsley and fought Chinook to a drawn match at game 20. Tinsley was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer a week after the match, and died seven months later.

==Death==
Tinsley died in Humble, Texas, on April 3, 1995, at the age of 68. He lived in Conyers, Georgia, but was visiting his sister in Texas when he died of cancer. He was survived by a twin sister, Mary Clark, who lives in Humble, Texas, and by two brothers, Ed, of Sarasota, Fla., and Joe, of Thornville, Ohio. He is buried at Greenlawn Cemetery, Columbus, Ohio, next to his father, Edward H. Tinsley and his mother, Viola Mae Tinsley. His brother, Harold Edward Tinsley is also buried there.

==Television appearances==
In 1957, Tinsley appeared as a guest challenger on the television game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;.

<text>Walter F. Hellman (June 15, 1916 – July 28, 1975) was the longest reigning world American checkers champion.

==Background==
Walter Oskar Fredrik Hellman was born in Gamla Nordsjö, Nordmaling, Sweden. His family moved to Gary, Indiana, United States, in 1927.

==Career==
Hellman first entered at the age of fifteen and won a Gary City chess tournament. He won his first Indiana State Tournament in 1933 at the age of seventeen. Hellman placed 10th in the masters&#x27; level at a young age of 18. Three years later, in the 9th American tournament of 1937 held at Martins Ferry, Ohio, Hellman placed third in the checkers. In 1946, Hellman entered and won the eleventh ACA American tournament held at Nashville, Tennessee, and also the third NCA American tournament played in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1948, Walter defeated Asa Long to become the new World Checkers Champion.

Hellman held the title the American Checker Federation World Championship from 1948 until 1955 and from 1958 until 1975. Hellman lost only one World Title match, in 1955 to Marion Tinsley. Winning the 8 other occasions in 1948, 1949, 1951, 1953, 1962, 1963, 1965 and 1967. His final appearance in the checkers arena was when Hellman played on the U.S. checkers team in the third International Match between the U.S. and Great Britain at Bournemouth, England.

<doc id="48164" wikidata="Q1203540" url="?curid=48164" title="Maximal ideal">
<text>In mathematics, more specifically in ring theory, a maximal ideal is an ideal that is maximal (with respect to set inclusion) amongst all &quot;proper&quot; ideals. In other words, &quot;I&quot; is a maximal ideal of a ring &quot;R&quot; if there are no other ideals contained between &quot;I&quot; and &quot;R&quot;.

Maximal ideals are important because the quotients of rings by maximal ideals are simple rings, and in the special case of unital commutative rings they are also fields.

In noncommutative ring theory, a maximal right ideal is defined analogously as being a maximal element in the poset of proper right ideals, and similarly, a maximal left ideal is defined to be a maximal element of the poset of proper left ideals. Since a one-sided maximal ideal &quot;A&quot; is not necessarily two-sided, the quotient &quot;R&quot;/&quot;A&quot; is not necessarily a ring, but it is a simple module over &quot;R&quot;. If &quot;R&quot; has a unique maximal right ideal, then &quot;R&quot; is known as a local ring, and the maximal right ideal is also the unique maximal left and unique maximal two-sided ideal of the ring, and is in fact the Jacobson radical J(&quot;R&quot;).

It is possible for a ring to have a unique maximal two-sided ideal and yet lack unique maximal one-sided ideals: for example, in the ring of 2 by 2 square matrices over a field, the zero ideal is a maximal two-sided ideal, but there are many maximal right ideals.

==Definition==
There are other equivalent ways of expressing the definition of maximal one-sided and maximal two-sided ideals. Given a ring &quot;R&quot; and a proper ideal &quot;I&quot; of &quot;R&quot; (that is &quot;I&quot; ≠ &quot;R&quot;), &quot;I&quot; is a maximal ideal of &quot;R&quot; if any of the following equivalent conditions hold:
* There exists no other proper ideal &quot;J&quot; of &quot;R&quot; so that &quot;I&quot; ⊊ &quot;J&quot;.
* For any ideal &quot;J&quot; with &quot;I&quot; ⊆ &quot;J&quot;, either &quot;J&quot; = &quot;I&quot; or &quot;J&quot; = &quot;R&quot;.
* The quotient ring &quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot; is a simple ring.
There is an analogous list for one-sided ideals, for which only the right-hand versions will be given. For a right ideal &quot;A&quot; of a ring &quot;R&quot;, the following conditions are equivalent to &quot;A&quot; being a maximal right ideal of &quot;R&quot;:
* There exists no other proper right ideal &quot;B&quot; of &quot;R&quot; so that &quot;A&quot; ⊊ &quot;B&quot;.
* For any right ideal &quot;B&quot; with &quot;A&quot; ⊆ &quot;B&quot;, either &quot;B&quot; = &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; = &quot;R&quot;.
* The quotient module &quot;R&quot;/&quot;A&quot; is a simple right &quot;R&quot;-module.

Maximal right/left/two-sided ideals are the dual notion to that of minimal ideals.

==Examples==
* If F is a field, then the only maximal ideal is {0}.
* In the ring Z of integers, the maximal ideals are the principal ideals generated by a prime number.
* More generally, all nonzero prime ideals are maximal in a principal ideal domain.
* The ideal formula_1 is a maximal ideal in ring formula_2. Generally, the maximal ideals of formula_2 are of the form formula_4 where formula_5 is a prime number and formula_6 is a polynomial in formula_2 which is irreducible modulo formula_5.
* Every prime ideal is a maximal ideal in a Boolean ring, i.e., a ring consisting of only idempotent elements. In fact, every prime ideal is maximal in a commutative ring formula_9 whenever there exists an integer formula_10 such that formula_11 for any formula_12.
* The maximal ideals of the polynomial ring formula_13 are principal ideals generated by formula_14 for some formula_15.
* More generally, the maximal ideals of the polynomial ring over an algebraically closed field &quot;K&quot; are the ideals of the form . This result is known as the weak Nullstellensatz.

==Properties==
* An important ideal of the ring called the Jacobson radical can be defined using maximal right (or maximal left) ideals.
* If &quot;R&quot; is a unital commutative ring with an ideal &quot;m&quot;, then &quot;k&quot; = &quot;R&quot;/&quot;m&quot; is a field if and only if &quot;m&quot; is a maximal ideal. In that case, &quot;R&quot;/&quot;m&quot; is known as the residue field. This fact can fail in non-unital rings. For example, formula_16 is a maximal ideal in formula_17, but formula_18 is not a field.
* If &quot;L&quot; is a maximal left ideal, then &quot;R&quot;/&quot;L&quot; is a simple left &quot;R&quot;-module. Conversely in rings with unity, any simple left &quot;R&quot;-module arises this way. Incidentally this shows that a collection of representatives of simple left &quot;R&quot;-modules is actually a set since it can be put into correspondence with part of the set of maximal left ideals of &quot;R&quot;.
* Krull&#x27;s theorem (1929): Every nonzero unital ring has a maximal ideal. The result is also true if &quot;ideal&quot; is replaced with &quot;right ideal&quot; or &quot;left ideal&quot;. More generally, it is true that every nonzero finitely generated module has a maximal submodule. Suppose &quot;I&quot; is an ideal which is not &quot;R&quot; (respectively, &quot;A&quot; is a right ideal which is not &quot;R&quot;). Then &quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot; is a ring with unity (respectively, &quot;R&quot;/&quot;A&quot; is a finitely generated module), and so the above theorems can be applied to the quotient to conclude that there is a maximal ideal (respectively, maximal right ideal) of &quot;R&quot; containing &quot;I&quot; (respectively, &quot;A&quot;).
* Krull&#x27;s theorem can fail for rings without unity. A radical ring, i.e. a ring in which the Jacobson radical is the entire ring, has no simple modules and hence has no maximal right or left ideals. See regular ideals for possible ways to circumvent this problem.
* In a commutative ring with unity, every maximal ideal is a prime ideal. The converse is not always true: for example, in any nonfield integral domain the zero ideal is a prime ideal which is not maximal. Commutative rings in which prime ideals are maximal are known as zero-dimensional rings, where the dimension used is the Krull dimension.
* A maximal ideal of a noncommutative ring might not be prime in the commutative sense. For example, let formula_19 be the ring of all formula_20 matrices over formula_21. This ring has a maximal ideal formula_22 for any prime formula_23, but this is not a prime ideal since (in the case formula_24)formula_25 and formula_26 are not in formula_22, but formula_28. However, maximal ideals of noncommutative rings &quot;are&quot; prime in the generalized sense below.

==Generalization==
For an &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;A&quot;, a maximal submodule &quot;M&quot; of &quot;A&quot; is a submodule satisfying the property that for any other submodule &quot;N&quot;, implies or . Equivalently, &quot;M&quot; is a maximal submodule if and only if the quotient module &quot;A&quot;/&quot;M&quot; is a simple module. The maximal right ideals of a ring &quot;R&quot; are exactly the maximal submodules of the module &quot;R&quot;&quot;R&quot;.

Unlike rings with unity, a nonzero module does not necessarily have maximal submodules. However, as noted above, &quot;finitely generated&quot; nonzero modules have maximal submodules, and also projective modules have maximal submodules.

As with rings, one can define the radical of a module using maximal submodules. Furthermore, maximal ideals can be generalized by defining a maximal sub-bimodule &quot;M&quot; of a bimodule &quot;B&quot; to be a proper sub-bimodule of &quot;M&quot; which is contained in no other proper sub-bimodule of &quot;M&quot;. The maximal ideals of &quot;R&quot; are then exactly the maximal sub-bimodules of the bimodule &quot;R&quot;&quot;R&quot;&quot;R&quot;.

==Education==
Peotone Elementary School (PES), located in town Peotone, serves kindergarten through 3rd grade. Peotone Intermediate Center (PIC), formerly Green Garden Elementary School in Green Garden Township, serves 4th and 5th grades. The Connor Shaw Center is home to the district offices and the Pre-K Center.

Peotone Junior High School serves grades six through eight, and has been located in the former Peotone Junior Senior High School building since the 2001-2002 school year; the high school continues to use some of the outdoor sports facilities at the junior high. Several referendums have been orchestrated to build a new sports complex at the new high school, but have failed; these have also included plans to build on to the existing high school and junior high in order to resolve overcrowding.

In 2001, a new high school was built on the northwest side of Peotone. It&#x27;s named Peotone High School While the school was designed for a capacity of 600 students, its student enrollment for the 2010-2011 fiscal year was approximately 687. The school mascot of all schools, from elementary through high school, is the Blue Devil.

As of 2007, Peotone schools had a total enrollment of 2,107 students in kindergarten through 12th grade.

In 2014, the Peotone School Board, in a 4-3 vote, decided to close the Wilton Center Elementary School in Wilton Township. The remaining elementary schools were reformatted to grade centers.

==Proposed south suburban airport==

Peotone has long been the proposed site of a new airport to serve the Chicago area. As is often the case with the construction of airports, the proposal is controversial. In 1967, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; ran several editorials regarding the need for a third airport in Peotone.

Proponents point out that the existing facilities at O&#x27;Hare and Midway airports cannot meet the transportation needs of the Chicago area, and that the development will bring economic prosperity to Chicago Southland, an area deprived of economic development, as well as the rest of the state. Politicians backing plans include former Governor Rod Blagojevich; former Representative Jesse Jackson Jr., Congressman Jerry Weller, the former representative of the district in which the airport would be located, and Will County Executive Larry Walsh. The efforts were also supported by then-state senator Barack Obama.

Opponents to the plan are concerned about the environmental disruption that would be caused by new airport construction and the roads that would be needed to support it. They also point out that Gary/Chicago International Airport in Gary, Indiana already exists, is closer to Chicago than Peotone, and is already undergoing expansion to support heavier use with minimal environmental impact. Politicians opposing the Peotone airport plan include former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, former Gary Mayor Scott King, Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels, and Representative Pete Visclosky from Indiana.

Former Representative Jesse Jackson, jr. was the head of a private group in Cook County looking to take ownership of the proposed airport. A state-backed IDOT plan is more friendly to the citizens of the actual footprint of the proposed airport by giving local control of the airport to Will County officials instead.

In the science-fiction novel &quot;The Boy Who Would Live Forever&quot; (2004), which was the fifth in the Gateway series, Frederik Pohl has a character fly out of &quot;Peotone International Airport&quot;. The late Pohl lived in Palatine, Illinois.

<doc id="48167" wikidata="Q8349849" url="?curid=48167" title="Congruence relation">
<text>In abstract algebra, a congruence relation (or simply congruence) is an equivalence relation on an algebraic structure (such as a group, ring, or vector space) that is compatible with the structure in the sense that algebraic operations done with equivalent elements will yield equivalent elements. Every congruence relation has a corresponding quotient structure, whose elements are the equivalence classes (or congruence classes) for the relation.

== Definition ==
The definition of a congruence depends on the type of algebraic structure under consideration. Particular definitions of congruence can be made for groups, rings, vector spaces, modules, semigroups, lattices, and so forth. The common theme is that a congruence is an equivalence relation on an algebraic object that is compatible with the algebraic structure, in the sense that the operations are well-defined on the equivalence classes.

=== General ===
The general notion of a congruence relation can be formally defined in the context of universal algebra, a field which studies ideas common to all algebraic structures. In this setting, a relation formula_1 on a given algebraic structure is called compatible if
: for each formula_2 and each formula_2-ary operation formula_4 defined on the structure: whenever formula_5 and ... and formula_6, then formula_7.

A congruence relation on the structure is then defined as an equivalence relation that is also compatible.

== Examples ==

=== Basic example ===
The prototypical example of a congruence relation is congruence modulo formula_2 on the set of integers. For a given positive integer formula_2, two integers formula_10 and formula_11 are called congruent modulo formula_2, written
: formula_13
if formula_14 is divisible by formula_2 (or equivalently if formula_10 and formula_11 have the same remainder when divided by formula_2).

For example, formula_19 and formula_20 are congruent modulo formula_21,
: formula_22
since formula_23 is a multiple of 10, or equivalently since both formula_19 and formula_20 have a remainder of formula_26 when divided by formula_21.

Congruence modulo formula_2 (for a fixed formula_2) is compatible with both addition and multiplication on the integers. That is,

if
: formula_30 and formula_31 
then
: formula_32 and formula_33

The corresponding addition and multiplication of equivalence classes is known as modular arithmetic. From the point of view of abstract algebra, congruence modulo formula_2 is a congruence relation on the ring of integers, and arithmetic modulo formula_2 occurs on the corresponding quotient ring.

=== Example: Groups ===
For example, a group is an algebraic object consisting of a set together with a single binary operation, satisfying certain axioms. If formula_36 is a group with operation formula_37, a congruence relation on formula_36 is an equivalence relation formula_39 on the elements of formula_36 satisfying
:formula_41 and formula_42 
for all formula_43. For a congruence on a group, the equivalence class containing the identity element is always a normal subgroup, and the other equivalence classes are the other cosets of this subgroup. Together, these equivalence classes are the elements of a quotient group.

=== Example: Rings ===
When an algebraic structure includes more than one operation, congruence relations are required to be compatible with each operation. For example, a ring possesses both addition and multiplication, and a congruence relation on a ring must satisfy
: formula_44 and formula_45
whenever formula_46 and formula_47. For a congruence on a ring, the equivalence class containing 0 is always a two-sided ideal, and the two operations on the set of equivalence classes define the corresponding quotient ring.

If formula_48 is a homomorphism between two algebraic structures (such as homomorphism of groups, or a linear map between vector spaces), then the relation formula_1 defined by
: formula_50 if and only if formula_51 
is a congruence relation on formula_52. By the first isomorphism theorem, the image of &quot;A&quot; under formula_53 is a substructure of &quot;B&quot; isomorphic to the quotient of &quot;A&quot; by this congruence.

On the other hand, the congruence relation formula_1 induces a unique homomorphism formula_55 given by
: formula_56.

Thus, there is a natural correspondence between the congruences and the homomorphisms of any given algebraic structure.

== Congruences of groups, and normal subgroups and ideals ==
In the particular case of groups, congruence relations can be described in elementary terms as follows:
If &quot;G&quot; is a group (with identity element &quot;e&quot; and operation *) and ~ is a binary relation on &quot;G&quot;, then ~ is a congruence whenever:
# Given any element &quot;a&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, (reflexivity);
# Given any elements &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, if , then (symmetry);
# Given any elements &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, if and , then (transitivity);
# Given any elements &quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;′, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;b&quot;′ of &quot;G&quot;, if and , then ;
# Given any elements &quot;a&quot; and &quot;a&quot;′ of &quot;G&quot;, if , then (this is implied by the other four, so is strictly redundant).

Conditions 1, 2, and 3 say that ~ is an equivalence relation.

A congruence ~ is determined entirely by the set of those elements of &quot;G&quot; that are congruent to the identity element, and this set is a normal subgroup.
Specifically, if and only if .
So instead of talking about congruences on groups, people usually speak in terms of normal subgroups of them; in fact, every congruence corresponds uniquely to some normal subgroup of &quot;G&quot;.

=== Ideals of rings and the general case ===
A similar trick allows one to speak of kernels in ring theory as ideals instead of congruence relations, and in module theory as submodules instead of congruence relations.

A more general situation where this trick is possible is with Omega-groups (in the general sense allowing operators with multiple arity). But this cannot be done with, for example, monoids, so the study of congruence relations plays a more central role in monoid theory.

== Universal algebra ==
The general notion of a congruence is particularly useful in universal algebra. An equivalent formulation in this context is the following:

A congruence relation on an algebra &quot;A&quot; is a subset of the direct product that is both an equivalence relation on &quot;A&quot; and a subalgebra of .

The kernel of a homomorphism is always a congruence. Indeed, every congruence arises as a kernel.
For a given congruence ~ on &quot;A&quot;, the set of equivalence classes can be given the structure of an algebra in a natural fashion, the quotient algebra.
The function that maps every element of &quot;A&quot; to its equivalence class is a homomorphism, and the kernel of this homomorphism is ~.

The lattice Con(&quot;A&quot;) of all congruence relations on an algebra &quot;A&quot; is algebraic.

John M. Howie described how semigroup theory illustrates congruence relations in universal algebra:
: In a group a congruence is determined if we know a single congruence class, in particular if we know the normal subgroup which is the class containing the identity. Similarly, in a ring a congruence is determined if we know the ideal which is the congruence class containing the zero. In semigroups there is no such fortunate occurrence, and we are therefore faced with the necessity of studying congruences as such. More than anything else, it is this necessity that gives semigroup theory its characteristic flavour. Semigroups are in fact the first and simplest type of algebra to which the methods of universal algebra must be applied ...

==Category theory==
In category theory, a congruence relation &quot;R&quot; on a category &quot;C&quot; is given by: for each pair of objects &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; in &quot;C&quot;, an equivalence relation &quot;R&quot;&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot; on Hom(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;), such that the equivalence relations respect composition of morphisms. See for details.

<text>Adrienne Cecile Rich ( ; May 16, 1929 – March 27, 2012) was an American poet, essayist and feminist. She was called &quot;one of the most widely read and influential poets of the second half of the 20th century&quot;, and was credited with bringing &quot;the oppression of women and lesbians to the forefront of poetic discourse&quot;. Rich criticized rigid forms of feminist identities, and valorized what she coined the &quot;lesbian continuum&quot;, which is a female continuum of solidarity and creativity that impacts and fills women&#x27;s lives.

Her first collection of poetry, &quot;A Change of World&quot;, was selected by icon W. H. Auden for the Yale Series of Younger Poets Award. Auden went on to write the introduction to the book. Rich famously declined the National Medal of Arts to protest House Speaker Newt Gingrich&#x27;s vote to end funding for the National Endowment for the Arts.

==Early life and education==

Adrienne Cecile Rich was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on May 16, 1929, the elder of two sisters. Her father, pathologist Arnold Rice Rich, was the chairman of pathology at The Johns Hopkins Medical School. Her mother, Helen Elizabeth (Jones) Rich, was a concert pianist and a composer. Her father was from a Jewish family, and her mother was a Southern Protestant; the girls were raised as Christians. Her paternal grandfather Samuel Rice was an Ashkenazi immigrant from Košice in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (present day Slovakia), while his mother was a Sephardic Jew from Vicksburg, Mississippi. Samuel Rice owned a successful shoe store in Birmingham. 

Adrienne Rich&#x27;s early poetic influence stemmed from her father, who encouraged her to read but also to write poetry. Her interest in literature was sparked within her father&#x27;s library, where she read the work of writers such as Ibsen, Arnold, Blake, Keats, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Tennyson. Her father was ambitious for Adrienne and &quot;planned to create a prodigy&quot;. Adrienne Rich and her younger sister were home schooled by their mother until Adrienne commenced public education in the fourth grade. The poems &quot;Sources&quot; and &quot;After Dark&quot; document her relationship with her father, describing how she worked hard to fulfill her parents&#x27; ambitions—moving into a world in which excellence was expected.

In later years, Rich went to Roland Park Country School, which she described as a &quot;good old fashioned girls&#x27; school [that] gave us fine role models of single women who were intellectually impassioned.&quot; After graduating from high school, Rich earned her diploma at Radcliffe College of Harvard University, where she focused on poetry and learning the writing craft, encountering no women teachers at all. 

In 1951, her senior year at college, Rich&#x27;s first collection of poetry, &quot;A Change of World&quot;, was chosen by the poet W. H. Auden for the Yale Series of Younger Poets Award. He went on to write the introduction to the published volume. Following graduation, Rich received a Guggenheim Fellowship to study at Oxford for a year. After visiting Florence, she chose not to return to Oxford, and spent her remaining time in Europe writing and exploring Italy.

==Early career: 1953–75==
In 1953, Rich married Alfred Haskell Conrad, an economics professor at Harvard University she had met as an undergraduate. She said of the match: &quot;I married in part because I knew no better way to disconnect from my first family. I wanted what I saw as a full woman&#x27;s life, whatever was possible.&quot; They settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and had three sons. In 1955, she published her second volume, &quot;The Diamond Cutters&quot;, a collection she said she wished had not been published, saying &quot;a lot of the poems are incredibly derivative,&quot; and citing a &quot;pressure to produce again... to make sure I was still a poet.&quot; That year she also received the Ridgely Torrence Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America. Her three children were born in 1955 (David), 1957 (Pablo) and 1959 (Jacob).

The 1960s began a period of change in Rich&#x27;s life: she received the National Institute of Arts and Letters award (1960), her second Guggenheim Fellowship to work at the Netherlands Economic Institute (1961), and the Bollingen Foundation grant for the translation of Dutch poetry (1962). 

In 1963, Rich published her third collection, &quot;Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law&quot;, which was a much more personal work examining her female identity, reflecting the increasing tensions she experienced as a wife and mother in the 1950s, marking a substantial change in Rich&#x27;s style and subject matter. In her 1982 essay &quot;Split at the Root: An Essay on Jewish Identity&quot;, Rich states: &quot;The experience of motherhood was eventually to radicalize me.&quot; The book met with harsh reviews. She comments, &quot;I was seen as &#x27;bitter&#x27; and &#x27;personal&#x27;; and to be personal was to be disqualified, and that was very shaking because I&#x27;d really gone out on a limb ... I realised I&#x27;d gotten slapped over the wrist, and I didn&#x27;t attempt that kind of thing again for a long time.&quot;

Moving her family to New York in 1966, Rich became involved with the New Left and became heavily involved in anti-war, civil rights, and feminist activism. Her husband took a teaching position at City College of New York. 

In 1968, she signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. Her collections from this period include &quot;Necessities of Life&quot; (1966), &quot;Leaflets&quot; (1969), and &quot;The Will to Change&quot; (1971), which reflect increasingly radical political content and interest in poetic form.

From 1967 to 1969, Rich lectured at Swarthmore College and taught at Columbia University School of the Arts as an adjunct professor in the Writing Division. Additionally, in 1968, she began teaching in the SEEK program in City College of New York, a position she continued until 1975. During this time, Rich also received the Eunice Tietjens Memorial Prize from &quot;Poetry Magazine&quot;. Rich and Conrad hosted anti-war and Black Panther fundraising parties at their apartment. Rising tensions began to split the marriage, and Rich moved out in mid-1970, getting herself a small studio apartment nearby. Shortly afterward, in October, Conrad drove into the woods and shot himself, widowing Rich.

In 1971, she was the recipient of the Shelley Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America and spent the next year and a half teaching at Brandeis University as the Hurst visiting professor of creative writing. &quot;Diving into the Wreck&quot;, a collection of exploratory and often angry poems, split the 1974 National Book Award for Poetry with Allen Ginsberg, &quot;The Fall of America&quot;. Declining to accept it individually, Rich was joined by the two other feminist poets nominated, Alice Walker and Audre Lorde, to accept it on behalf of all women &quot;whose voices have gone and still go unheard in a patriarchal world.&quot; The following year, Rich took up the position of the Lucy Martin Donnelly Fellow at Bryn Mawr College.

==Later life: 1976–2012==

In 1976, Rich began her partnership with Jamaican-born novelist and editor Michelle Cliff, which lasted until her death. In her controversial work &quot;Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution&quot;, published the same year, Rich acknowledged that, for her, lesbianism was a political as well as a personal issue, writing, &quot;The suppressed lesbian I had been carrying in me since adolescence began to stretch her limbs.&quot; The pamphlet &quot;Twenty-One Love Poems&quot; (1977), which was incorporated into the following year&#x27;s &quot;Dream of a Common Language&quot; (1978), marked the first direct treatment of lesbian desire and sexuality in her writing, themes which run throughout her work afterwards, especially in &quot;A Wild Patience Has Taken Me This Far&quot; (1981) and some of her late poems in &quot;The Fact of a Doorframe&quot; (2001). In her analytical work &quot;Adrienne Rich: the moment of change&quot;, Langdell suggests these works represent a central rite of passage for the poet, as she (Rich) crossed a threshold into a newly constellated life and a &quot;new relationship with the universe&quot;. During this period, Rich also wrote a number of key socio-political essays, including &quot;Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence&quot;, one of the first to address the theme of lesbian existence. In this essay, she asks &quot;how and why women&#x27;s choice of women as passionate comrades, life partners, co-workers, lovers, community, has been crushed, invalidated, forced into hiding&quot;. Some of the essays were republished in &quot;On Lies, Secrets and Silence: Selected Prose, 1966–1978&quot; (1979). In integrating such pieces into her work, Rich claimed her sexuality and took a role in leadership for sexual equality.

From 1976 to 1979, Rich taught at City College and Rutgers University as an English professor. In 1979, she received an honorary doctorate from Smith College and moved with Cliff to Montague, MA. Ultimately, they moved to Santa Cruz, where Rich continued her career as a professor, lecturer, poet, and essayist. Rich and Cliff took over editorship of the lesbian arts journal &quot;Sinister Wisdom&quot; (1981–1983). Rich taught and lectured at UC Santa Cruz, Scripps College, San Jose State University, and Stanford University during the 1980s and 1990s. From 1981 to 1987, Rich served as an A.D. White Professor-At-Large for Cornell University. Rich published several volumes in the next few years: &quot;Your Native Land, Your Life&quot; (1986), &quot;Blood, Bread, and Poetry&quot; (1986), and &quot;Time&#x27;s Power: Poems 1985–1988&quot; (1989). She also was awarded the Ruth Paul Lilly Poetry Prize (1986), the Elmer Holmes Bobst Award in Arts and Letters from NYU, and the National Poetry Association Award for Distinguished Service to the Art of Poetry (1989).

In 1977, Rich became an associate of the Women&#x27;s Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.

Janice Raymond, in the foreword of her 1979 book &quot;The Transsexual Empire&quot;, thanked Rich for &quot;constant encouragement&quot; and cited her in the book&#x27;s chapter &quot;Sappho by Surgery.&quot; &quot;The Transsexual Empire&quot; is considered by some LGBT and feminist critics to be transphobic, and many have criticized Rich for her involvement in and support of its production. While Rich never explicitly disavowed her support for Raymond&#x27;s work, Leslie Feinberg cites Rich as having been supportive during Feinberg&#x27;s writing of &quot;Transgender Warriors&quot;.

By the early 1980s, Rich was using canes and wheelchairs due to rheumatoid arthritis. Diagnosed with the condition at age 22, Rich kept her disability quiet for decades. The cold air in New England motivated Rich and Cliff to settle in California. A 1992 spinal operation required Rich to wear a metal halo screwed into her head.

In June 1984, Rich presented a speech at the International Conference of Women, Feminist Identity, and Society in Utrecht, Netherlands titled &quot;Notes Toward a Politics of Location.&quot; Her keynote speech is a major document on politics of location and the birth of the concept of female &quot;locatedness&quot;. In discussing the locations from which women speak, Rich attempts to reconnect female thought and speech with the female body, with an intent to reclaim the body through verbalizing self-representation. Rich begins the speech by noting that while she speaks the words in Europe, she has searched for them in the United States. By acknowledging her location in an essay on the progression of the women&#x27;s movement, she expresses her concern for all women, not just women in Providence. Through widening her audience to women across the world Rich not only influences a larger movement but she invites all women to consider their existence. Through imagining geographical locations on a map as history and as places where women are created, and further focusing on those locations, Rich asks women to examine where they were created. In an attempt to try to find a sense of belonging in the world, Rich asks the audience not to begin with a continent, country, or house, but to start with the geography closest to themselves –which is their body. Rich, therefore, challenges members of the audience and readers to form their own identity by refusing to be defined by the parameters of government, religion, and home. The essay hypothesizes the women&#x27;s movement at the end of the 20th century. In an encouraging call for the women&#x27;s movement, Rich discusses how the movement for change is an evolution in itself. Through de-masculinizing and de-Westernizing itself, the movement becomes a critical mass of many different voices, languages and overall actions. She pleads for the movement to change in order to experience change. She further insists that women must change it. In her essay, Rich considers how one&#x27;s background might influence their identity. She furthers this notion by noting her own exploration of the body, her body, as female, as white, as Jewish and as a body in a nation. Rich is careful to define the location in which her writing takes place. Throughout her essay, Rich refers back to the concept of location. She recounts her growth towards understanding how the women&#x27;s movement grounded in Western culture and limited to the concerns of white women, then incorporated verbal and written expression of black United States citizens. Such professions have allowed her to experience the meaning of her whiteness as a point of location for which she needed to take responsibility. In 1986, she published the essay in her prose collection &quot;Blood, Bread, and Poetry&quot;.

Rich&#x27;s work with the New Jewish Agenda led to the founding of &quot;Bridges: A Journal for Jewish Feminists and Our Friends&quot; in 1990, a journal for which Rich served as editor. This work explored the relationship between private and public histories, especially in the case of Jewish women&#x27;s rights. Her next published piece, &quot;An Atlas of the Difficult World&quot; (1991), won both the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Book Award in Poetry and the Lenore Marshall/&quot;Nation&quot; Award as well as the Poet&#x27;s Prize in 1993 and Commonwealth Award in Literature in 1991. During the 1990s Rich joined advisory boards such as the Boston Woman&#x27;s Fund, National Writers Union and Sisterhood in Support of Sisters in South Africa. On the role of the poet, she wrote, &quot;We may feel bitterly how little our poems can do in the face of seemingly out-of-control technological power and seemingly limitless corporate greed, yet it has always been true that poetry can break isolation, show us to ourselves when we are outlawed or made invisible, remind us of beauty where no beauty seems possible, remind us of kinship where all is represented as separation.&quot; In July 1994, Rich won the MacArthur Fellowship, the &quot;Genius Grant&quot; for her work as a poet and writer. Also in 1992, Rich became a grandmother to Julia Arden Conrad and Charles Reddington Conrad.

In 1997, Rich declined the National Medal of Arts in protest against the House of Representatives&#x27; vote to end the National Endowment for the Arts as well as policies of the Clinton Administration regarding the arts generally, and literature in particular, stating that &quot;I could not accept such an award from President Clinton or this White House because the very meaning of art, as I understand it, is incompatible with the cynical politics of this administration ... [Art] means nothing if it simply decorates the dinner table of the power which holds it hostage&quot;. Her next few volumes were a mix of poetry and essays: &quot;Midnight Salvage: Poems 1995–1998&quot; (1999), &quot;The Art of the Possible: Essays and Conversations&quot; (2001), and &quot;Fox: Poems 1998–2000&quot; (2001).

In the early 2000s, Rich participated in anti-war activities, protesting against the threat of war in Iraq, both through readings of her poetry and other activities. In 2002, she was appointed a chancellor of the newly augmented board of the Academy of American Poets, along with Yusef Komunyakaa, Lucille Clifton, Jay Wright (who declined the honor), Louise Glück, Heather McHugh, Rosanna Warren, Charles Wright, Robert Creeley, and Michael Palmer. She won the 2003 Yale Bollingen Prize for American Poetry and was applauded by the panel of judges for her &quot;honesty at once ferocious, humane, her deep learning, and her continuous poetic exploration and awareness of multiple selves.&quot; In October 2006, Equality Forum honored Rich&#x27;s work, featuring her as an icon of LGBT history.

In 2009, despite initially having reservations about the movement, Rich endorsed the call for a cultural and academic boycott of Israel, denouncing &quot;the Occupation&#x27;s denial of Palestinian humanity, destruction of Palestinian lives and livelihoods, the &quot;settlements&quot;, the state&#x27;s physical and psychological walls against dialogue.&quot;

Rich died on March 27, 2012, at the age of 82 in her Santa Cruz, California, home. Her son, Pablo Conrad, reported that her death resulted from long-term rheumatoid arthritis. Her last collection was published the year before her death. Rich was survived by her sons, two grandchildren and her partner Michelle Cliff.

=== On feminism ===
Adrienne Rich wrote several pieces that address the rights of women in society. In &quot;Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law&quot; she offered a critical analysis of the life of being both a mother and a daughter-in-law, and the impact of their gender in their lives. &quot;Diving Into the Wreck&quot; was written in the early &#x27;seventies, and the collection marks the start of her darkening tone as she wrote about feminism and other social issues. In particular, she wrote openly about her outrage at the patriarchal nature of the greater society. In doing so, she became an example for other women to follow in the hopes that continued proactive work against sexism would eventually counteract it.

Her poems are also famous for their feminist elements. One such poem is &quot;Power&quot;, which was written about Marie Curie, one of the most important female icons of the 20th century. In this poem, she discussed the element of power and feminism. Curie was slowly succumbing to the radiation that she absorbed in her research, to which Rich refers in the poem as her source of power. The poem discusses the concept of power, particularly from a woman&#x27;s point of view.

Besides poems and novels, Rich also wrote nonfiction books that tackled feminist issues. Some of them were: &quot;Of Woman Born, Motherhood as Experience and Institution, Blood, Bread and Poetry, etc.&quot; Especially, &quot;Bread and Poetry&quot; contains the famous feminist essay entitled &quot;Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence&quot;, and &quot;Feminism and Community. &quot;

Her works, interviews, and documentaries demonstrated Rich&#x27;s in-depth perspective on feminism and society.

For one, Rich had something to say about the use of the term itself. She preferred using the term &quot;women&#x27;s liberation&quot; rather than feminism. She thought the latter term was more likely to induce resistance from women of the next generation. Also, she feared that the term would amount to nothing more than a label if used extensively. On the other hand, using the term women&#x27;s liberation means that women can finally be free from factors that can be seen as oppressive to their rights.

Rich also wrote in depth about &quot;white feminism&quot; and the need for intersectionality within the feminist movement. In &quot;Blood, Bread, and Poetry&quot;, Rich wrote that &quot;feminism became a political and spiritual base from which I could move to examine rather than try to hide my own racism, recognize that I have anti-racist work to do continuously within myself&quot;. She went on to write that &quot;so long as [feminists] identify only with white women, we are still connected to that system of objectification and callousness and cruelty called racism&quot;. Rich implored white feminists to consider the fact that &quot;[they], as victims of objectification, have objectified other women&quot; through their role as the oppressor, and through the white privilege they inherently possess under a racist regime.

Rich&#x27;s views on feminism are evident in her works. She says in &quot;Of Woman Born&quot; that &quot;we need to understand the power and powerlessness embodied in motherhood in patriarchal culture.&quot; She also speaks regarding the need for women to unite in her book &quot;On Lies, Secrets and Silence.&quot; In this book, she wrote:

&quot;Women have often felt insane when cleaving to the truth of our experience. Our future depends on the sanity of each of us, and we have a profound stake, beyond the personal, in the project of describing our reality as candidly and fully as we can to each other.&quot;

Given the feminist conditions during the 1950s–1970s, it can be said that Rich&#x27;s works on feminism were revolutionary. Her views on equality and the need for women to maximize their potential can be seen as progressive for the time. Her views strongly coincided with feminist thinking during that period. According to Rich, society was founded on patriarchy and limits the rights of women. For equality to be achieved between the sexes, the prevailing notions must be readjusted to accommodate the female perspective.

=== On racism ===
Rich wrote at length on the topic of white feminism and intersectionality within the feminist movement. Citing such prominent black feminist activists and academics as Gloria T. Hull, Michele Russel, Lorraine Bethel, and Toni Morrison in her works, Rich dedicated several chapters of her book &quot;Blood, Bread, and Poetry&quot; to the subject of racism. Of her essay &quot;Of Woman Born,&quot; Rich wrote that it &quot;could have been stronger had it drawn on more of the literature by Black women toward which Toni Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Sula&quot; inevitably pointed me.&quot;

Touching on the privilege conferred to her as a white feminist author, Rich wrote in &quot;Blood, Bread, and Poetry&quot; that she &quot;is probably going to be taken more seriously in some quarters than the Black woman scholar whose combined experience and research give her far more penetrating knowledge and awareness than mine. I will be taken more seriously because I am white, [..] and because the invisibility of the woman of color who is the scholar/critic &quot;or&quot; the poet &quot;or&quot; the novelist is part of the structure of &quot;my&quot; privilege, even my credibility.&quot;

In 1981, Rich co-presented the keynote address for the National Women&#x27;s Studies Association Convention in Storrs, Connecticut, along with Audre Lorde, delivering her speech entitled &quot;Disobedience is What NWSA is Potentially About.&quot; The theme of the convention was &quot;Women Respond to Racism&quot;, and Rich noted the homophobia and racism that still existed &quot;in the enclave of Women&#x27;s studies itself, where lesbians are still feared and women of color are still ignored&quot;. Rich went on to say that &quot;women of color who are found in the wrong place as defined at any given time by the white fathers will receive their retribution unseen: if they are beaten, raped, insulted, harassed, mutilated, murdered, these events will go unreported, unpunished, unconnected; and white women are not even supposed to know they occur, let alone identify with the sufferings endured.&quot; Rich asked the audience: &quot;how disobedient will Women&#x27;s Studies be in the 1980s; how will this Association address the racism, misogyny, homophobia of the university and of the corporate and militist society in which it is embedded; how will white feminist scholars and teachers and students practice disobedience to patriarchy?&quot; Rich implored the audience to rid themselves of the idea that &quot;by opposing racist violence, by doing anti-racist work, or by becoming feminists white women somehow cease to carry racism within them&quot;, asserting that white women are never absolved of their white privilege and must continually commit to anti-racist work while they are still in the role of the oppressor.

In 2009, Rich came forward with a statement in support of the U.S. Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (USACBI), criticizing Israeli occupation and expressing her “continued solidarity with the Palestinian people’s long resistance.”

<text>The following is a list of mental disorders as defined at any point by the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). A mental disorder, also known as a mental illness, mental health condition, or psychiatric disorder, is characterized by a pattern of behavior or mental function that significantly impairs personal functioning or causes considerable distress.

The DSM, a classification and diagnostic guide published by the American Psychiatric Association, includes over 450 distinct definitions of mental disorders. Meanwhile, the ICD, published by the World Health Organization, stands as the international standard for categorizing all medical conditions, including sections on mental and behavioral disorders.

Revisions and updates are periodically made to the diagnostic criteria and descriptions in the DSM and ICD to reflect current understanding and consensus within the mental health field. The list includes conditions currently recognized as mental disorders according to these systems. There is ongoing debate among mental health professionals, including psychiatrists, about the definitions and criteria used to delineate mental disorders. There is particular concern over whether certain conditions should be classified as &quot;mental illnesses&quot; or might more accurately be described as neurological disorders or in other terms.

<text>In the 1960s, national parks in the Netherlands were defined as areas of at least consisting of natural terrains, water and/or forests, with a special landscape and flora and fauna.

The first two national parks were founded in the 1930s by private organisations. The first official national park, Schiermonnikoog National Park, was not established until 1989. The most recent national park to have been established is the Nieuw Land National Park, which was established in 2018.

In 2011, the government decided to make the provinces responsible for the national parks.

As of 2021, there are 21 national parks.

<text>A humanoid robot is a robot resembling the human body in shape. The design may be for functional purposes, such as interacting with human tools and environments, for experimental purposes, such as the study of bipedal locomotion, or for other purposes. In general, humanoid robots have a torso, a head, two arms, and two legs, though some humanoid robots may replicate only part of the body. Androids are humanoid robots built to aesthetically resemble humans.

== History ==
The concept of a humanoid robot originated in many different cultures around the world. Some of the earliest accounts of the idea of humanoid automata date to the 4th century BCE in Greek mythologies and various religious and philosophical texts from China. Physical prototypes of humanoid automata were later created in the Middle East, Italy, Japan, and France.

=== Greece ===
The Greek god of blacksmiths, Hephaestus, created several different humanoid automata in various myths. In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad,&quot; Hephaestus created golden handmaidens and imbued them with human-like voices to serve as speaking tools or instruments. Another Greek myth details how Hephaestus crafted a giant bronze automaton named Talos to protect the island of Crete from invaders.

=== China ===
In the 3rd century BCE, a Taoist philosophical text called the &quot;Liezi&quot;, written by Chinese philosopher Lie Yukou, detailed the idea of a humanoid automaton. The text includes mention of an engineer named Yan Shi who created a life-size, human-like robot for the fifth king of the Chinese Zhou Dynasty, King Mu. The robot was primarily constructed of leather and wood. It was capable of walking, singing, and moving all parts of its body.

=== Middle East ===
In the 13th century, a Muslim engineer named Ismail al-Jazari designed various humanoid automata. He created a waitress robot that would dispense drinks from a liquid reservoir and appear out of an automatic door to serve them. Another automaton he created was used for hand washing to refill a basin with water after being drained.

=== Italy ===

In the 1400s, Leonardo da Vinci conceptualized a complex mechanical robot clad in a suit of armor, capable of sitting, standing, and independently moving its arms. The entire robot was operated by a system of pulleys and cables.

=== Japan ===
From the 17th to 19th centuries, the Japanese built humanoid automata called &quot;karakuri&quot; puppets. These puppets resembled dolls and were used for entertainment in theatre, homes, and religious festivals. &quot;Karakuri&quot; puppets that were used for theater plays were called &quot;butai karakuri&quot;. Small &quot;karakuri puppets&quot; found in homes, called &quot;zashiki kurakuri&quot;, were placed on tables to dance, beat drums, or serve drinks. The puppets used in religious festivals were known as &quot;Dashi karakuri&quot;, and they served to reenact myths and legends.

=== France ===
In the 18th century, French inventor Jacques de Vaucanson created a significant humanoid automaton called &quot;The Flute Player&quot;. This wooden, human-sized robot was capable of playing various melodies with the flute. It consisted of a system of bellows, pipes, weights, and other mechanical components to simulate to the muscles necessary to play the flute.

==Applications==

Humanoid robots are now used as research tools in several scientific areas. Researchers study the human body structure and behavior (biomechanics) to build humanoid robots. On the other side, the attempt to simulate the human body leads to a better understanding of it. Human cognition is a field of study which is focused on how humans learn from sensory information in order to acquire perceptual and motor skills. This knowledge is used to develop computational models of human behavior, and it has been improving over time.

It has been suggested that very advanced robotics will facilitate the enhancement of ordinary humans. See transhumanism.

=== Medical and research ===
Humanoid robots are a valuable resource in the world of medicine and biotechnology, as well as other fields of research such as biomechanics and cognitive science. Humanoid robots are being used to develop complex prosthetics for individuals with physical disabilities such as missing limbs. The WABIAN-2 is a new medical humanoid robot created to help patients in the rehabilitation of their lower limbs.

Although the initial aim of humanoid research was to build better orthosis and prosthesis for human beings, knowledge has been transferred between both disciplines. A few examples are powered leg prosthesis for the neuromuscularly impaired, ankle-foot orthosis, biological realistic leg prosthesis, and forearm prosthesis.

Humanoid robots can be used as test subjects for the practice and development of personalized healthcare aids, essentially performing as robotic nurses for demographics such as the elderly. Humanoids are also suitable for some procedurally-based vocations, such as reception-desk administrators and automotive manufacturing line workers. In essence, since they can use tools and operate equipment and vehicles designed for the human form, humanoids could theoretically perform any task a human being can, so long as they have the proper software. However, the complexity of doing so is immense.

=== Entertainment ===
Humanoid robots have had a long history in the realm of entertainment, from the conception and ideas in the story of Prometheus to the application and physical build of modern animatronics used for theme parks. Current uses and development of humanoid robots in theme parks are focused on creating stuntronics. Stuntronics are humanoid robots built for serving as stunt doubles, and are designed to simulate life-like, untethered, dynamic movement. Several Disney theme park shows utilize animatronic robots that look, move and speak much like human beings. Although these robots look realistic, they have no cognition or physical autonomy. Various humanoid robots and their possible applications in daily life are featured in an independent documentary film called &quot;Plug &amp; Pray&quot;, which was released in 2010.

=== Demonstrative ===

Though many real-world applications for humanoid robots are unexplored, their primary use is to demonstrate up-and-coming technologies. Modern examples of humanoid robots, such as the Honda Asimo, are revealed to the public in order to demonstrate new technological advancements in motor skills, such as walking, climbing, and playing an instrument. Other humanoid robots have been developed for household purposes, however excel only in single purpose skills and are far from autonomous. Humanoid robots, especially those with artificial intelligence algorithms, could be useful for future dangerous and/or distant space exploration missions, without having the need to turn back around again and return to Earth once the mission is completed.

==Sensors==
A sensor is a device that measures some attribute of the world. Being one of the three primitives of robotics (besides planning and control), sensing plays an important role in robotic paradigms.

Sensors can be classified according to the physical process with which they work or according to the type of measurement information that they give as output. In this case, the second approach was used.

===Proprioceptive===
Proprioceptive sensors sense the position, orientation, and speed of the humanoid&#x27;s body and joints, along with other internal values.

In human beings, the otoliths and semi-circular canals (in the inner ear) are used to maintain balance and orientation. Additionally, humans use their own proprioceptive sensors (e.g. touch, muscle extension, limb position) to help with their orientation. Humanoid robots use accelerometers to measure the acceleration, from which velocity can be calculated by integration; tilt sensors to measure inclination; force sensors placed in robot&#x27;s hands and feet to measure contact force with environment; position sensors that indicate the actual position of the robot (from which the velocity can be calculated by derivation); and even speed sensors.

=== Exteroceptive ===
Arrays of tactels can be used to provide data on what has been touched. The Shadow Hand uses an array of 34 tactels arranged beneath its polyurethane skin on each finger tip. Tactile sensors also provide information about forces and torques transferred between the robot and other objects.

Vision refers to processing data from any modality which uses the electromagnetic spectrum to produce an image. In humanoid robots it is used to recognize objects and determine their properties. Vision sensors work most similarly to the eyes of human beings. Most humanoid robots use CCD cameras as vision sensors.

Sound sensors allow humanoid robots to hear speech and environmental sounds, akin to the ears of the human being. Microphones are usually used for the robots to convey speech.

==Actuators==
Actuators are the motors responsible for motion in the robot.

Humanoid robots are constructed in such a way that they mimic the human body. They use actuators that perform like muscles and joints, though with a different structure. The actuators of humanoid robots can be either electric, pneumatic, or hydraulic. It is ideal for these actuators to have high power, low mass, and small dimensions.

=== Electric ===
Electric actuators are the most popular types of actuators in humanoid robots. These actuators are smaller in size, and a single electric actuator may not produce enough power for a human-sized joint. Therefore, it is common to use multiple electric actuators for a single joint in a humanoid robot. An example of a humanoid robot using electric actuators is HRP-2.

=== Hydraulic ===
Hydraulic actuators produce higher power than electric actuators and pneumatic actuators, and they have the ability to control the torque they produce better than other types of actuators. However, they can become very bulky in size. One solution to counter the size issue is electro-hydrostatic actuators (EHA). The most popular example of a humanoid robot using hydraulic actuators is the ATLAS robot made by Boston Dynamics.

=== Pneumatic ===
Pneumatic actuators operate on the basis of gas compressibility. As they are inflated, they expand along the axis, and as they deflate, they contract. If one end is fixed, the other will move in a linear trajectory. A popular example of a pneumatic actuator is the Mac Kibben muscle.

== Planning and control ==
Planning in robots is the process of planning out motions and trajectories for the robot to carry out. Control is the actual execution of these planned motions and trajectories. In humanoid robots, the planning must carry out biped motions, meaning that robots should plan motions similar to a human. Since one of the main uses of humanoid robots is to interact with humans, it is important for the planning and control mechanisms of humanoid robots to work in a variety of terrain and environments.

The question of walking biped robots stabilization on the surface is of great importance. Maintenance of the robot&#x27;s gravity center over the center of bearing area for providing a stable position can be chosen as a goal of control.

To maintain dynamic balance during the walk, a robot needs information about contact force and its current and desired motion. The solution to this problem relies on a major concept, the Zero Moment Point (ZMP).

Another characteristic of humanoid robots is that they move, gather information (using sensors) on the &quot;real world&quot;, and interact with it. They do not stay still like factory manipulators and other robots that work in highly structured environments. To allow humanoids to move in complex environments, planning and control must focus on self-collision detection, path planning and obstacle avoidance.

Humanoid robots do not yet have some features of the human body. They include structures with variable flexibility, which provide safety (to the robot itself and to the people), and redundancy of movements, i.e. more degrees of freedom and therefore wide task availability. Although these characteristics are desirable to humanoid robots, they will bring more complexity and new problems to planning and control. The field of whole-body control deals with these issues and addresses the proper coordination of numerous degrees of freedom, e.g. to realize several control tasks simultaneously while following a given order of priority.

==Timeline of developments==
== In science fiction ==
A common theme for the depiction of humanoid robots in science fiction pertains to how they can help humans in society or serve as threats to humanity. This theme essentially questions whether artificial intelligence is a force of good or bad for mankind. Humanoid robots that are depicted as good for society and benefit humans are Commander Data in &quot;Star Trek&quot; and C-3PO in &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Opposite portrayals where humanoid robots are shown as scary and threatening to humans are the T-800 in &quot;Terminator&quot; and Megatron in &quot;Transformers.&quot; An Indian Tamil-language film which showed the pros and cons of a humanoid robot Chitti.

Another prominent theme found in science fiction regarding humanoid robots focuses on personhood. Certain films, particularly &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot;, explore whether or not a constructed, synthetic being should be considered a person. In the films, androids called &quot;replicants&quot; are created indistinguishably from human beings, yet they are shunned and do not possess the same rights as humans. This theme incites audience sympathy while also sparking unease at the idea of humanoid robots mimicking humans too closely.

== Criticism ==
Humanoid robots, which are designed to resemble and mimic human form and behavior, have faced several criticisms:

* Uncanny Valley Effect: As robots become more human-like but not quite perfect, they can evoke feelings of unease or revulsion in humans.
* Ethical Confusion: Humanoid robots can potentially lead to ethical dilemmas, creating confusion about their rights or treatment.

<text>The Liberation Army of Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac (LAPMB; , UÇPMB; , OVPMB) was an Albanian militant insurgent group fighting for separation from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for three municipalities: Preševo, Medveđa, and Bujanovac, home to most of the Albanians in south Serbia, adjacent to Kosovo. Of the three municipalities, two have an ethnic Albanian majority, whilst Medveđa has a significant minority of them.

The UÇPMB&#x27;s uniforms, procedures and tactics mirrored those of the then freshly disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). The 1,500-strong paramilitary launched an insurgency in the Preševo Valley from 1999 to 2001, with the goal of joining these municipalities to Kosovo. The EU condemned what it described as the &quot;extremism&quot; and use of &quot;illegal terrorist actions&quot; by the group.

== Background ==
In 1992–1993, ethnic Albanians created the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) which started attacking police forces and secret-service officials who abused Albanian civilians in 1995. Starting in 1998, the KLA was involved in frontal battle, with increasing numbers of Yugoslav security forces. Escalating tensions led to the Kosovo War in February 1998.

==History==
After the end of the Kosovo War in 1999, a three-mile &quot;Ground Safety Zone&quot; (GSZ) was established between Kosovo (governed by the UN) and inner Serbia and Montenegro. Yugoslav Forces (VJ) units were not permitted there, and only the lightly armed Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs forces were left in the area.

The exclusion zone included the predominantly Albanian village of Dobrosin, but not Preševo. Serbian police had to stop patrolling the area to avoid being ambushed. Ethnic Albanian politicians opposed to the KLA were attacked, including Zemail Mustafi, the vice-president of the Bujanovac branch of Slobodan Milošević&#x27;s Socialist Party of Serbia who was later assassinated.

Between 21 June 1999 and 12 November 2000, 294 attacks were recorded. 246 in Bujanovac, 44 in Medveđa and 6 in Preševo. These attacks resulted in 14 people killed (of which six were civilians and eight were policemen), 37 people wounded (two UN observers, three civilians and 34 policemen) and five civilians kidnapped. In their attacks, UÇPMB used mostly assault rifles, machine guns, mortars and sniper rifles, but occasionally also RPGs, hand grenades, and anti-tank and anti-personnel mines.

The UÇPMB included child soldiers.

The Liberation army of Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac aimed to create autonomy for the three Albanian municipalities within Serbia and drive Serbian institutions out and hold an election for unification with the Republic of Kosovo.

On 4 March 2000, around 500 UÇPMB fighters attacked the city of Dobrosin. The battle resulted in one UÇPMB and one Serb fighter killed, while another 175 were displaced. On 21 November 2000, members of the UÇPMB attacked the city of Dobrosin and the surrounding villages. Heavy fighting resulted in the VJ retreating to Končulj, Lučane, and Bujanovac. After four policemen were killed and two wounded by the UÇPMB, the VJ retreated back to the GSZ.

On 6 January 2001, the UÇPMB took control of Gornja Šušaja, and were well received by the locals. On 19 January, in command of Bardhyl Osmani, raided VJ positions near Crnotince. On 20 January, the VJ launched an attack against the UÇPMB stronghold. The battle lasted for four days when VJ forces were forced to withdraw.

On 13 May 2001, the VJ and Serbian police launched an attack on the UÇPMB in Oraovica before they entered Sector B. The fighting began at 6:10 am when Yugoslav troops entered the city. At 7:00 am, the UÇPMB attacked Serbian police and fired three rockets towards Oraovica and VJ positions. Attacks from the UÇPMB stopped at 8:00 am. On 14 May 2001, the Yugoslav troops captured the city after the UÇPMB attacked again at 2:15 pm.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFE/RL&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 May 2001, members of the UÇPMB signed the Končulj Agreement, which resulted in the full demilitarization, demobilization, and disarmament of the UÇPMB. The agreement stated that the VJ was allowed to enter the GSZ by 31 May 2001. At the same time, the Serbian side agreed to sign the Statement on conditional amnesty for members of the UÇPMB, which promised amnesty to UÇPMB fighters on 23 May 2001.

As the situation escalated, NATO allowed the VJ to reclaim the GSZ on 24 May 2001, at the same time giving the UÇPMB the opportunity to turn themselves over to the Kosovo Force (KFOR), which promised to only take their weapons and note their names before releasing them. More than 450 UÇPMB members took advantage of KFOR&#x27;s &quot;screen and release&quot; policy, among them commander Shefket Musliu, who turned himself over to KFOR at a checkpoint along the GSZ just after midnight of 26 May 2001.

==Aftermath==
With the signing of the Končulj Agreement in May 2001, the former KLA and UÇPMB fighters next moved to western Macedonia where the NLA was established, which fought against the Macedonian government in 2001. Ali Ahmeti organized the NLA from former KLA and UÇPMB fighters from Kosovo, Albanian insurgents from the UÇPMB in Serbia, young Albanian radicals, nationalists from Macedonia, and foreign mercenaries. The acronym was the same as the KLA&#x27;s in Albanian.

Another Albanian paramilitary organization Albanian National Army (ANA, AKSh) also had former UÇPMB fighters. The group is associated with FBKSh (National Front for Reunification of Albanians), its political wing. The group participated in attacks against Macedonian forces with the NLA. After the NLA disbanded, the ANA later went and operated in the Preševo Valley.

== Organization ==
The UÇPMB was organized into five brigades, each with their own commanders:

* 111th Brigade, commanded by Sami Haziju
* 112th Brigade, commanded by Ridvan Qazimi
* 113th Brigade, commanded by Bardhyl Osmani
* 114th Brigade, commanded by Muhamet Xhemajli

<text>Sir William Ramsay (; 2 October 1852 – 23 July 1916) was a Scottish chemist who discovered the noble gases and received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1904 &quot;in recognition of his services in the discovery of the inert gaseous elements in air&quot; along with his collaborator, John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics that same year for their discovery of argon. After the two men identified argon, Ramsay investigated other atmospheric gases. His work in isolating argon, helium, neon, krypton, and xenon led to the development of a new section of the periodic table.

==Early years==
Ramsay was born at 2 Clifton Street in Glasgow on 2 October 1852, the son of civil engineer and surveyor, William C. Ramsay, and his wife, Catherine Robertson. The family lived at 2 Clifton Street in the city centre, a three-storey and basement Georgian townhouse. The family moved to 1 Oakvale Place in the Hillhead district in his youth. He was a nephew of the geologist Sir Andrew Ramsay.

He was educated at Glasgow Academy and then apprenticed to Robert Napier, a shipbuilder in Govan. However, he instead decided to study Chemistry at the University of Glasgow, matriculating in 1866 and graduating in 1869. He then undertook practical training with the chemist Thomas Anderson and then went to study in Germany at the University of Tübingen with Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig where his doctoral thesis was entitled &quot;Investigations in the Toluic and Nitrotoluic Acids&quot;.

Ramsay went back to Glasgow as Anderson&#x27;s assistant at Anderson College. He was appointed as Professor of Chemistry at the University College of Bristol in 1879 and married Margaret Buchanan in 1881. In the same year he became the Principal of University College, Bristol, and somehow managed to combine that with active research both in organic chemistry and on gases.

==Career==

William Ramsay formed pyridine in 1876 from acetylene and hydrogen cyanide in an iron-tube furnace in what was the first synthesis of a heteroaromatic compound.
In 1887, he succeeded Alexander Williamson as the chair of Chemistry at University College London (UCL). It was here at UCL that his most celebrated discoveries were made. As early as 1885–1890, he published several notable papers on the oxides of nitrogen, developing the skills that he needed for his subsequent work. 
On the evening of 19 April 1894, Ramsay attended a lecture given by Lord Rayleigh. Rayleigh had noticed a discrepancy between the density of nitrogen made by chemical synthesis and nitrogen isolated from the air by removal of the other known components. After a short conversation, he and Ramsay decided to investigate this. In August Ramsay told Rayleigh he had isolated a new, heavy component of air, which did not appear to have any chemical reactivity. He named this inert gas &quot;argon&quot;, from the Greek word meaning &quot;lazy&quot;. In the following years, working with Morris Travers, he discovered neon, krypton, and xenon. He also isolated helium, which had only been observed in the spectrum of the sun, and had not previously been found on earth. In 1910 he isolated and characterised radon.

During 1893–1902, Ramsay collaborated with Emily Aston, a British chemist, in experiments on mineral analysis and atomic weight determination. Their work included publications on the molecular surface energies of mixtures of non-associating liquids.

Ramsay was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1899.

He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, and invested as such by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October 1902.

In 1904, Ramsay received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
That same year, he was elected an International Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences. Ramsay&#x27;s standing among scientists led him to become an adviser to the Indian Institute of Science. He suggested Bangalore as the location for the institute.

Ramsay endorsed the Industrial and Engineering Trust Ltd., a company that claimed it could extract gold from seawater, in 1905. It bought property on the English coast to begin its secret process. The company never produced any gold.

Ramsay was the president of the British Association in 1911–1912.

==Personal life==
In 1881, Ramsay was married to Margaret Johnstone Marshall (née Buchanan), daughter of George Stevenson Buchanan. They had a daughter, Catherine Elizabeth (Elska) and a son, William George, who died at 40.

Ramsay lived in Hazlemere, Buckinghamshire, until his death. He died in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, on 23 July 1916 from nasal cancer at the age of 63 and was buried in Hazlemere parish church.

==Legacy==
A blue plaque at number 12 Arundel Gardens, Notting Hill, commemorates his life and work.

The Sir William Ramsay School in Hazlemere and Ramsay grease are named after him.

There is a memorial to him by Charles Hartwell in the north aisle of the choir at Westminster Abbey.

In 1923, University College London named its new Chemical Engineering department and seat after Ramsay, which had been funded by the Ramsay Memorial Fund. One of Ramsay&#x27;s former graduates, H. E. Watson was the third Ramsay professor of chemical engineering.

On 2 October 2019, Google celebrated his 167th birthday with a Google Doodle.

<text>Surrey () is a ceremonial county in South East England. It is bordered by Greater London to the northeast, Kent to the east, East and West Sussex to the south, and Hampshire and Berkshire to the west. The largest settlement is Woking.

The county has an area of and a population of 1,214,540. Much of the north of the county forms part of the Greater London Built-up Area, which includes the suburbs within the M25 motorway as well as Woking (103,900), Guildford (77,057), and Leatherhead (32,522). The west of the county contains part of built-up area which includes Camberley, Farnham, and Frimley and which extends into Hampshire and Berkshire. The south of the county is rural, and its largest settlements are Horley (22,693) and Godalming (22,689). For local government purposes Surrey is a non-metropolitan county with eleven districts. The county historically included much of south-west Greater London but excluded what is now the borough of Spelthorne, which was part of Middlesex. It is one of the home counties.

The defining geographical feature of the county is the North Downs, a chalk escarpment which runs from the south-west to north-east and divides the densely populated north from the more rural south; it is pierced by the rivers Wey and Mole, both tributaries of the Thames. The north of the county is a lowland, part of the Thames basin. The south-east is part of the Weald, and the south-west contains the Surrey Hills and Thursley, Hankley and Frensham Commons, an extensive area of heath. The county has the densest woodland cover in England, at 22.4 per cent.

== Geography ==

Surrey is divided in two by the chalk ridge of the North Downs, running east–west. The ridge is pierced by the rivers Wey and Mole, tributaries of the Thames, which formed the northern border of the county before modern redrawing of county boundaries, which has left part of its north bank within the county. To the north of the Downs the land is mostly flat, forming part of the basin of the Thames. The geology of this area is dominated by London Clay in the east, Bagshot Sands in the west and alluvial deposits along the rivers.

To the south of the Downs in the western part of the county are the sandstone Surrey Hills, while further east is the plain of the Low Weald, rising in the extreme southeast to the edge of the hills of the High Weald. The Downs and the area to the south form part of a concentric pattern of geological deposits which also extends across southern Kent and most of Sussex, predominantly composed of Wealden Clay, Lower Greensand and the chalk of the Downs.

Much of Surrey is in the Metropolitan Green Belt. It contains valued reserves of mature woodland (reflected in the official logo of Surrey County Council, a pair of interlocking oak leaves). Among its many notable beauty spots are Box Hill, Leith Hill, Frensham Ponds, Newlands Corner and Puttenham &amp; Crooksbury Commons.

Surrey is the most wooded county in England, with 22.4% coverage compared to a national average of 11.8% and as such is one of the few counties not to recommend new woodlands in the subordinate planning authorities&#x27; plans. In 2020 the Surrey Heath district had the highest proportion of tree cover in England at 41%. Surrey also contains England&#x27;s principal concentration of lowland heath, on sandy soils in the west of the county.
Agriculture not being intensive, there are many commons and access lands, together with an extensive network of footpaths and bridleways including the North Downs Way, a scenic long-distance path. Accordingly, Surrey provides many rural and semi-rural leisure activities, with a large horse population in modern terms.

The highest elevation in Surrey is Leith Hill near Dorking. It is above sea level and is the second highest point in southeastern England after Walbury Hill in West Berkshire which is .

===Surrey rivers===
The longest river to enter Surrey is the Thames, which historically formed the boundary between the county and Middlesex. As a result of the 1965 boundary changes, many of the Surrey boroughs on the south bank of the river were transferred to Greater London, shortening the length associated with the county. The Thames now forms the Surrey–Berkshire border between Runnymede and Staines-upon-Thames, before flowing wholly within Surrey to Sunbury, from which point it marks the Surrey–Greater London border as far as Surbiton.

The River Wey is the longest tributary of the Thames above London. Other tributaries of the Thames with their courses partially in Surrey include the Mole, the Addlestone branch and Chertsey branch of the River Bourne (which merge shortly before joining the Thames), and the Hogsmill River, which drains Epsom and Ewell.

The upper reaches of the River Eden, a tributary of the Medway, are in Tandridge District, in east Surrey.

The River Colne and its anabranch, the Wraysbury River, make a brief appearance in the north of the county to join the Thames at Staines.

Like the rest of the British Isles, Surrey has a maritime climate with warm summers and cool winters. The Met Office weather station at Wisley, about to the north-east of Guildford, has recorded temperatures between (August 2003) and (January 1982). From 2006 until 2015, the Wisley weather station held the UK July record high of .
== Settlements ==
Surrey has a population of approximately 1.1 million people. Its largest town is Woking with a population of 105,367, followed by Guildford with 77,057, and Walton-on-Thames with 66,566. Towns of between 30,000 and 50,000 inhabitants include Ewell, and Camberley.

Much of the north of the county, extending to Guildford, is within the Greater London Built-up Area. This is an area of continuous urban sprawl linked without significant interruption of rural area to Greater London. In the west, there is a developing conurbation straddling the Hampshire/Surrey border, including the Surrey towns of Camberley and Farnham.

Guildford is often regarded as the historic county town, although the county administration was moved to Newington in 1791 and to Kingston upon Thames in 1893. The county council&#x27;s headquarters were outside the county&#x27;s boundaries from 1 April 1965, when Kingston and other areas were included within Greater London by the London Government Act 1963, until the administration moved to Reigate at the start of 2021.

== History ==
=== Ancient British and Roman periods ===

Before Roman times the area today known as Surrey was probably largely occupied by the Atrebates tribe, centred at Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester), in the modern county of Hampshire, but eastern parts of it may have been held by the Cantiaci, based largely in Kent. The Atrebates are known to have controlled the southern bank of the Thames from Roman texts describing the tribal relations between them and the powerful Catuvellauni on the north bank.

In about AD 42 King Cunobelinus (in Welsh legend Cynfelin ap Tegfan) of the Catuvellauni died and war broke out between his sons and King Verica of the Atrebates. The Atrebates were defeated, their capital captured and their lands made subject to Togodumnus, king of the Catuvellauni, ruling from Camulodunum (Colchester). Verica fled to Gaul and appealed for Roman aid. The Atrebates were allied with Rome during the invasion of Britain in AD 43.

During the Roman era, the only important settlement within the historic area of Surrey was the London suburb of Southwark (now part of Greater London), but there were small towns at Staines, Ewell, Dorking, Croydon and Kingston upon Thames.Remains of Roman rural temples have been excavated on Farley Heath and near Wanborough and Titsey, and possible temple sites at Chiddingfold, Betchworth and Godstone. The area was traversed by Stane Street and other Roman roads.

=== Formation of Surrey ===
During the 5th and 6th centuries Surrey was conquered and settled by Saxons. The names of possible tribes inhabiting the area have been conjectured on the basis of place names. These include the (around Godalming) and (between Woking and Wokingham in Berkshire). It has also been speculated that the entries for the and peoples in the Tribal Hidage may refer to two groups living in the vicinity of Surrey. Together their lands were assessed at a total of 7,000 hides, equal to the assessment for Sussex or Essex.

Surrey may have formed part of a larger Middle Saxon kingdom or confederacy, also including areas north of the Thames. The name Surrey is derived from (or ), meaning &quot;southern region&quot; (while Bede refers to it as ) and this may originate in its status as the southern portion of the Middle Saxon territory.
If it ever existed, the Middle Saxon kingdom had disappeared by the 7th century, and Surrey became a frontier area disputed between the kingdoms of Kent, Essex, Sussex, Wessex and Mercia, until its permanent absorption by Wessex in 825. Despite this fluctuating situation it retained its identity as an enduring territorial unit. During the 7th century Surrey became Christian and initially formed part of the East Saxon diocese of London, indicating that it was under East Saxon rule at that time, but was later transferred to the West Saxon diocese of Winchester. Its most important religious institution throughout the Anglo-Saxon period and beyond was Chertsey Abbey, founded in 666. At this point Surrey was evidently under Kentish domination, as the abbey was founded under the patronage of King Ecgberht of Kent. However, a few years later at least part of it was subject to Mercia, since in 673–675 further lands were given to Chertsey Abbey by Frithuwald, a local sub-king () ruling under the sovereignty of Wulfhere of Mercia. A decade later Surrey passed into the hands of King Caedwalla of Wessex, who also conquered Kent and Sussex, and founded a monastery at Farnham in 686.

The region remained under the control of Caedwalla&#x27;s successor Ine in the early 8th century. Its political history for most of the 8th century is unclear, although West Saxon control may have broken down around 722, but by 784–785 it had passed into the hands of King Offa of Mercia. Mercian rule continued until 825, when following his victory over the Mercians at the Battle of Ellandun, King Egbert of Wessex seized control of Surrey, along with Sussex, Kent and Essex. It was incorporated into Wessex as a shire and continued thereafter under the rule of the West Saxon kings, who eventually became kings of all of England.

=== West Saxon and English shire ===

In the 9th century England was afflicted, along with the rest of northwestern Europe, by the attacks of Scandinavian Vikings. Surrey&#x27;s inland position shielded it from coastal raiding, so that it was not normally troubled except by the largest and most ambitious Scandinavian armies.

In 851 an exceptionally large invasion force of Danes arrived at the mouth of the Thames in a fleet of about 350 ships, which would have carried over 15,000 men. Having sacked Canterbury and London and defeated King Beorhtwulf of Mercia in battle, the Danes crossed the Thames into Surrey, but were slaughtered by a West Saxon army led by King Æthelwulf in the Battle of Aclea, bringing the invasion to an end.

Two years later the men of Surrey marched into Kent to help their Kentish neighbours fight a raiding force at Thanet, but suffered heavy losses including their ealdorman, Huda. In 892 Surrey was the scene of another major battle when a large Danish army, variously reported at 200, 250 and 350 ship-loads, moved west from its encampment in Kent and raided in Hampshire and Berkshire. Withdrawing with their loot, the Danes were intercepted and defeated at Farnham by an army led by Alfred the Great&#x27;s son Edward, the future King Edward the Elder, and fled across the Thames towards Essex.

Surrey remained safe from attack for over a century thereafter, due to its location and to the growing power of the West Saxon, later English, kingdom. Kingston was the scene for the coronations of Æthelstan in 924 and of Æthelred the Unready in 978, and, according to later tradition, also of other 10th-century Kings of England. The renewed Danish attacks during the disastrous reign of Æthelred led to the devastation of Surrey by the army of Thorkell the Tall, which ravaged all of southeastern England in 1009–1011. The climax of this wave of attacks came in 1016, which saw prolonged fighting between the forces of King Edmund Ironside and the Danish king Cnut, including an English victory over the Danes somewhere in northeastern Surrey, but ended with the conquest of England by Cnut.

Cnut&#x27;s death in 1035 was followed by a period of political uncertainty, as the succession was disputed between his sons. In 1036 Alfred, son of King Æthelred, returned from Normandy, where he had been taken for safety as a child at the time of Cnut&#x27;s conquest of England. It is uncertain what his intentions were, but after landing with a small retinue in Sussex he was met by Godwin, Earl of Wessex, who escorted him in apparently friendly fashion to Guildford. Having taken lodgings there, Alfred&#x27;s men were attacked as they slept and killed, mutilated or enslaved by Godwin&#x27;s followers, while the prince himself was blinded and imprisoned, dying shortly afterwards. This must have contributed to the antipathy between Godwin and Alfred&#x27;s brother Edward the Confessor, who came to the throne in 1042.

This hostility peaked in 1051, when Godwin and his sons were driven into exile; returning the following year, the men of Surrey rose to support them, along with those of Sussex, Kent, Essex and elsewhere, helping them secure their reinstatement and the banishment of the king&#x27;s Norman entourage. The repercussions of this antagonism helped bring about the Norman Conquest of England in 1066.

The Domesday Book records that the largest landowners in Surrey (then &quot;Sudrie&quot;) at the end of Edward&#x27;s reign were Chertsey Abbey and Harold Godwinson, Earl of Wessex and later king, followed by the estates of King Edward himself. Apart from the abbey, most of whose lands were within the shire, Surrey was not the principal focus of any major landowner&#x27;s holdings, a tendency which was to persist in later periods. Given the vast and widespread landed interests and the national and international preoccupations of the monarchy and the earldom of Wessex, the Abbot of Chertsey was therefore probably the most important figure in the local elite.

The Anglo-Saxon period saw the emergence of the shire&#x27;s internal division into 14 hundreds, which continued until Victorian times. These were the hundreds of Blackheath, Brixton, Copthorne, Effingham Half-Hundred, Elmbridge, Farnham, Godalming, Godley, Kingston, Reigate, Tandridge, Wallington, Woking and Wotton.

=== Later Medieval Surrey ===

After the Battle of Hastings, the Norman army advanced through Kent into Surrey, where they defeated an English force which attacked them at Southwark and then burned that suburb. Rather than try to attack London across the river, the Normans continued west through Surrey, crossed the Thames at Wallingford in Berkshire and descended on London from the north-west. As was the case across England, the native ruling class of Surrey was virtually eliminated by Norman seizure of land. Only one significant English landowner, the brother of the last English Abbot of Chertsey, remained by the time the Domesday survey was conducted in 1086. At that time the largest landholding in Surrey, as in many other parts of the country, was the expanded royal estate, while the next largest holding belonged to Richard fitz Gilbert, founder of the de Clare family.
In 1088, King William II granted William de Warenne the title of Earl of Surrey as a reward for Warenne&#x27;s loyalty during the rebellion that followed the death of William I. When the male line of the Warennes became extinct in the 14th century, the earldom was inherited by the Fitzalan Earls of Arundel. The Fitzalan line of Earls of Surrey died out in 1415, but after other short-lived revivals in the 15th century the title was conferred in 1483 on the Howard family, who still hold it. However, Surrey was not a major focus of any of these families&#x27; interests.
Guildford Castle, one of many fortresses originally established by the Normans to help them subdue the country, was rebuilt in stone and developed as a royal palace in the 12th century. Farnham Castle was built during the 12th century as a residence for the Bishop of Winchester, while other stone castles were constructed in the same period at Bletchingley by the de Clares and at Reigate by the Warennes.

During King John&#x27;s struggle with the barons, Magna Carta was issued in June 1215 at Runnymede near Egham. John&#x27;s efforts to reverse this concession reignited the war, and in 1216 the barons invited Prince Louis of France to take the throne. Having landed in Kent and been welcomed in London, he advanced across Surrey to attack John, then at Winchester, occupying Reigate and Guildford castles along the way.

Guildford Castle later became one of the favourite residences of King Henry III, who considerably expanded the palace there. During the baronial revolt against Henry, in 1264 the rebel army of Simon de Montfort passed southwards through Surrey on their way to the Battle of Lewes in Sussex. Although the rebels were victorious, soon after the battle royal forces captured and destroyed Bletchingley Castle, whose owner Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Hertford and Gloucester, was de Montfort&#x27;s most powerful ally.

By the 14th century, castles were of dwindling military importance, but remained a mark of social prestige, leading to the construction of castles at Starborough near Lingfield by Lord Cobham, and at Betchworth by John Fitzalan, whose father had recently inherited the Earldom of Surrey. Though Reigate and Bletchingley remained modest settlements, the role of their castles as local centres for the two leading aristocratic interests in Surrey had enabled them to gain borough status by the early 13th century. As a result, they gained representation in Parliament when it became established towards the end of that century, alongside the more substantial urban settlements of Guildford and Southwark. Surrey&#x27;s third sizeable town, Kingston, despite its size, borough status and historical association with the monarchy, did not gain parliamentary representation until 1832.

Surrey had little political or economic significance in the Middle Ages. Its agricultural wealth was limited by the infertility of most of its soils, and it was not the main power-base of any important aristocratic family, nor the seat of a bishopric. The London suburb of Southwark was a major urban settlement, and the proximity of the capital boosted the wealth and population of the surrounding area, but urban development elsewhere was sapped by the overshadowing predominance of London and by the lack of direct access to the sea. Population pressure in the 12th and 13th centuries initiated the gradual clearing of the Weald, the forest spanning the borders of Surrey, Sussex and Kent, which had hitherto been left undeveloped due to the difficulty of farming on its heavy clay soil.

Surrey&#x27;s most significant source of prosperity in the later Middle Ages was the production of woollen cloth, which emerged during that period as England&#x27;s main export industry. The county was an early centre of English textile manufacturing, benefiting from the presence of deposits of fuller&#x27;s earth, the rare mineral composite important in the process of finishing cloth, around Reigate and Nutfield. The industry in Surrey was focused on Guildford, which gave its name to a variety of cloth, &quot;gilforte&quot;, which was exported widely across Europe and the Middle East and imitated by manufacturers elsewhere in Europe. However, as the English cloth industry expanded, Surrey was outstripped by other growing regions of production.
Though Surrey was not the scene of serious fighting in the various rebellions and civil wars of the period, armies from Kent heading for London via Southwark passed through what were then the extreme north-eastern fringes of Surrey during the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381 and Cade&#x27;s Rebellion in 1450, and at various stages of the Wars of the Roses in 1460, 1469 and 1471. The upheaval of 1381 also involved widespread local unrest in Surrey, as was the case all across south-eastern England, and some recruits from Surrey joined the Kentish rebel army.

In 1082 a Cluniac abbey was founded at Bermondsey by Alwine, a wealthy English citizen of London. Waverley Abbey near Farnham, founded in 1128, was the first Cistercian monastery in England. Over the next quarter-century monks spread out from here to found new houses, creating a network of twelve monasteries descended from Waverley across southern and central England. The 12th and early 13th centuries also saw the establishment of Augustinian priories at Merton, Newark, Tandridge, Southwark and Reigate. A Dominican friary was established at Guildford by Henry III&#x27;s widow Eleanor of Provence, in memory of her grandson who had died at Guildford in 1274. In the 15th century a Carthusian priory was founded by King Henry V at Sheen. These would all perish, along with the still important Benedictine abbey of Chertsey, in the 16th-century Dissolution of the Monasteries.

Now fallen into disuse, some English counties had nicknames for those raised there such as a &#x27;tyke&#x27; from Yorkshire, or a &#x27;yellowbelly&#x27; from Lincolnshire. In the case of Surrey, the term was a &#x27;Surrey capon&#x27;, from Surrey&#x27;s role in the later Middle Ages as the county where chickens were fattened up for the London meat markets.

=== Early Modern Surrey ===

Under the early Tudor kings, magnificent royal palaces were constructed in northeastern Surrey, conveniently close to London. At Richmond an existing royal residence was rebuilt on a grand scale under King Henry VII, who also founded a Franciscan friary nearby in 1499. The still more spectacular palace of Nonsuch was later built for Henry VIII near Ewell. The palace at Guildford Castle had fallen out of use long before, but a royal hunting lodge existed outside the town. All these have since been demolished.

During the Cornish Rebellion of 1497, the rebels heading for London briefly occupied Guildford and fought a skirmish with a government detachment on Guildown outside the town, before marching on to defeat at Blackheath in Kent. The forces of Wyatt&#x27;s Rebellion in 1554 passed through what was then northeastern Surrey on their way from Kent to London, briefly occupying Southwark and then crossing the Thames at Kingston after failing to storm London Bridge.

Surrey&#x27;s cloth industry declined in the 16th century and collapsed in the 17th, harmed by falling standards and competition from more effective producers in other parts of England. The iron industry in the Weald, whose rich deposits had been exploited since prehistoric times, expanded and spread from its base in Sussex into Kent and Surrey after 1550. New furnace technology stimulated further growth in the early 17th century, but this hastened the extinction of the business as the mines were worked out. However, this period also saw the emergence of important new industries, centred on the valley of the Tillingbourne, south-east of Guildford, which often adapted watermills originally built for the now moribund cloth industry. The production of brass goods and wire in this area was relatively short-lived, falling victim to competitors in the Midlands in the mid-17th century, but the manufacture of paper and gunpowder proved more enduring. For a time in the mid-17th century the Surrey mills were the main producers of gunpowder in England.

A glass industry also developed in the mid-16th century on the southwestern borders of Surrey, but had collapsed by 1630, as the wood-fired Surrey glassworks were surpassed by emerging coal-fired works elsewhere in England. The Wey Navigation, opened in 1653, was one of England&#x27;s first canal systems.
George Abbot, the son of a Guildford clothworker, served as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1611–1633. In 1619 he founded Abbot&#x27;s Hospital, an almshouse in Guildford, which is still operating. He also made unsuccessful efforts to revitalise the local cloth industry. One of his brothers, Robert, became Bishop of Salisbury, while another, Maurice, was a founding shareholder of the East India Company who became the company&#x27;s Governor and later Lord Mayor of London.

Southwark expanded rapidly in this period, and by 1600, if considered as a separate entity, it was the second-largest urban area in England, behind only London itself. Parts of it were outside the jurisdiction of the government of the City of London, and as a result the area of Bankside became London&#x27;s principal entertainment district, since the social control exercised there by the local authorities of Surrey was less effective and restrictive than that of the City authorities. Bankside was the scene of the golden age of Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre, with the work of playwrights including William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, Ben Jonson and John Webster performed in its playhouses. The leading actor and impresario Edward Alleyn founded the College of God&#x27;s Gift in Dulwich with an endowment including an art collection, which was later expanded and opened to the public in 1817, becoming Britain&#x27;s first public art gallery.
Surrey almost entirely escaped the direct impact of fighting during the main phase of the English Civil War in 1642–1646. The local Parliamentarian gentry led by Sir Richard Onslow were able to secure the county without difficulty on the outbreak of war. Farnham Castle was briefly occupied by the advancing Royalists in late 1642, but was easily stormed by the Parliamentarians under Sir William Waller. A new Royalist offensive in late 1643 saw skirmishing around Farnham between Waller&#x27;s forces and Ralph Hopton&#x27;s Royalists, but these brief incursions into the western fringes of Surrey marked the limits of Royalist advances on the county. At the end of 1643 Surrey combined with Kent, Sussex and Hampshire to form the South-Eastern Association, a military federation modelled on Parliament&#x27;s existing Eastern Association.

In the uneasy peace that followed the Royalists&#x27; defeat, a political crisis in summer 1647 saw Sir Thomas Fairfax&#x27;s New Model Army pass through Surrey on their way to occupy London, and subsequent billeting of troops in the county caused considerable discontent. During the brief Second Civil War of 1648, the Earl of Holland entered Surrey in July, hoping to ignite a Royalist revolt. He raised his standard at Kingston and advanced south, but found little support. After confused manoeuvres between Reigate and Dorking as Parliamentary troops closed in, his force of 500 men fled northwards and was overtaken and routed at Kingston.

Surrey had a central role in the history of the radical political movements unleashed by the civil war. In October 1647 the first manifesto of the movement that became known as the Levellers, &quot;The Case of the Armie Truly Stated&quot;, was drafted at Guildford by the elected representatives of army regiments and civilian radicals from London. This document combined specific grievances with wider demands for constitutional change on the basis of popular sovereignty. It formed the template for the more systematic and radical &quot;Agreement of the People&quot;, drafted by the same men later that month. It also led to the Putney Debates shortly afterwards, in which its signatories met with Oliver Cromwell and other senior officers in the Surrey village of Putney, where the army had established its headquarters, to argue over the future political constitution of England. In 1649 the Diggers, led by Gerrard Winstanley, established their communal settlement at St. George&#x27;s Hill near Weybridge to implement egalitarian ideals of common ownership, but were eventually driven out by the local landowners through violence and litigation. A smaller Digger commune was then established near Cobham, but suffered the same fate in 1650.

=== Modern history ===

Prior to the Reform Act 1832, Surrey returned fourteen Members of Parliament (MPs), two representing the county and two each from the six boroughs of Bletchingley, Gatton, Guildford, Haslemere, Reigate and Southwark. For two centuries before the Reform Act, the dominant political network in Surrey was that of the Onslows of Clandon Park, a gentry family established in the county from the early 17th century, who were raised to the peerage in 1716. Members of the family won at least one of Surrey&#x27;s two county seats in all but three of the 30 general elections between 1628 and 1768, while they took one or both of the seats for their local borough of Guildford in every election from 1660 to 1830, usually representing the Whig Party after its emergence in the late 1670s. Successive heads of the family held the post of Lord Lieutenant of Surrey continuously from 1716 to 1814.
One of the principal residences of the British monarchy in the 18th century was Kew Palace in north Surrey, leased by Queen Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach in 1728 and inhabited by her son Frederick, Prince of Wales, and later by King George III and Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. After the latter&#x27;s death at the palace in 1818 it was sold. The White House was demolished about this time, but the Dutch House survives and is now a museum.

In 1765 the Richmond Theatre was built in Surrey under the supervision of David Garrick. It was modelled after the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and served as one of Surrey&#x27;s main theatre&#x27;s until it was demolished in 1884.

Until the modern era Surrey, apart from its northeastern corner, was quite sparsely populated in comparison with many parts of southern England, and remained somewhat rustic despite its proximity to the capital. Communications began to improve, and the influence of London to increase, with the development of turnpike roads and a stagecoach system in the 18th century. A far more profound transformation followed with the arrival of the railways, beginning in the late 1830s. The availability of rapid transport enabled prosperous London workers to settle all across Surrey and travel daily to work in the capital. This phenomenon of commuting brought explosive growth to Surrey&#x27;s population and wealth, and tied its economy and society inextricably to London.

There was rapid expansion in existing towns like Guildford, Farnham, and most spectacularly Croydon, while new towns such as Woking and Redhill emerged beside the railway lines. The huge numbers of incomers to the county and the transformation of rural, farming communities into a &quot;commuter belt&quot; contributed to a decline in the traditional local culture, including the gradual demise of the distinctive Surrey dialect. This may have survived among the &quot;Surrey Men&quot; into the late 19th century, but is now extinct.
Meanwhile, London itself spread swiftly across north-eastern Surrey. In 1800 it extended only to Vauxhall; a century later the city&#x27;s growth had reached as far as Putney and Streatham. This expansion was reflected in the creation of the County of London in 1889, detaching the areas subsumed by the city from Surrey. The expansion of London continued in the 20th century, engulfing Croydon, Kingston and many smaller settlements. This led to a further contraction of Surrey in 1965 with the creation of Greater London, under the London Government Act 1963; however, Staines and Sunbury-on-Thames, previously in Middlesex, were transferred to Surrey, extending the county across the Thames. Surrey&#x27;s boundaries were altered again in 1974 when Gatwick Airport was transferred to West Sussex.

In 1849 Brookwood Cemetery was established near Woking to serve the population of London, connected to the capital by its own railway service. It soon developed into the largest burial ground in the world. Woking was also the site of Britain&#x27;s first crematorium, which opened in 1878, and its first mosque, founded in 1889. In 1881 Godalming became the first town in the world with a public electricity supply.

The eastern part of Surrey was transferred from the Diocese of Winchester to that of Rochester in 1877. In 1905 this area was separated to form a new Diocese of Southwark. The rest of the county, together with part of eastern Hampshire, was separated from Winchester in 1927 to become the Diocese of Guildford, whose cathedral was consecrated in 1961.
During the later 19th century Surrey became important in the development of architecture in Britain and the wider world. Its traditional building forms made a significant contribution to the vernacular revival architecture associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement, and would exert a lasting influence. The prominence of Surrey peaked in the 1890s, when it was the focus for globally important developments in domestic architecture, in particular the early work of Edwin Lutyens, who grew up in the county and was greatly influenced by its traditional styles and materials.
The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw the demise of Surrey&#x27;s long-standing industries manufacturing paper and gunpowder. Most of the county&#x27;s paper mills closed in the years after 1870, and the last survivor shut in 1928. Gunpowder production fell victim to the First World War, which brought about a huge expansion of the British munitions industry, followed by sharp contraction and consolidation when the war ended, leading to the closure of the Surrey powder mills.

New industrial developments included the establishment of the vehicle manufacturers Dennis Brothers in Guildford in 1895. Beginning as a maker of bicycles and then of cars, the firm soon shifted into the production of commercial and utility vehicles, becoming internationally important as a manufacturer of fire engines and buses. Though much reduced in size and despite multiple changes of ownership, this business continues to operate in Guildford. Kingston and nearby Ham became a centre of aircraft manufacturing, with the establishment in 1912 of the Sopwith Aviation Company and in 1920 of its successor H.G. Hawker Engineering, which later became Hawker Aviation and then Hawker Siddeley.
During the Second World War a section of the GHQ Stop Line, a system of pillboxes, gun emplacements, anti-tank obstacles and other fortifications, was constructed along the North Downs. This line, running from Somerset to Yorkshire, was intended as the principal fixed defence of London and the industrial core of England against the threat of invasion. German invasion plans envisaged that the main thrust of their advance inland would cross the North Downs at the gap in the ridge formed by the Wey valley, thus colliding with the defence line around Guildford.

Between the wars Croydon Airport, opened in 1920, served as the main airport for London, but it was superseded after the Second World War by Heathrow, and closed in 1959. Gatwick Airport, where commercial flights began in 1933, expanded greatly in the 1950s and 1960s, but the area occupied by the airport was transferred from Surrey to West Sussex in 1974.

In June 1972, British European Airways Flight 548 crashed near Staines just after taking off from Heathrow Airport. This remains the worst air accident in the UK.

== Historic architecture and monuments ==

Few traces of the ancient British and Roman periods survive in Surrey. There are a number of round barrows and bell barrows in various locations, mostly dating to the Bronze Age. Remains of Iron Age hillforts exist at Holmbury Hill, Hascombe Hill, Anstiebury (near Capel), Dry Hill (near Lingfield), St Ann&#x27;s Hill (Chertsey) and St George&#x27;s Hill (Weybridge). Most of these sites were created in the 1st century BC and many were re-occupied during the middle of the 1st century AD. Only fragments of Stane Street and Ermine Street, the Roman roads which crossed the county, remain.

Anglo-Saxon elements survive in a number of Surrey churches, notably at Guildford (St Mary), Godalming (St Peter &amp; St Paul), Stoke D&#x27;Abernon (St Mary), Thursley, Witley, Compton and Albury (in &quot;Old Albury&quot;).

Numerous medieval churches exist in Surrey, but the county&#x27;s parish churches are typically relatively small and simple, and experienced particularly widespread destruction and remodelling of their form in the course of Victorian restoration. Important medieval church interiors survive at Chaldon, Lingfield, Stoke D&#x27;Abernon, Compton and Dunsfold. Large monastic churches fell into ruin after their institutions were dissolved, although fragments of Waverley Abbey and Newark Priory survive. Southwark Priory, no longer in Surrey has survived, though much altered, and is now Southwark Cathedral. Farnham Castle largely retains its medieval structure, while the keep and fragments of the curtain walls and palace buildings survive at Guildford Castle.

Very little non-military secular architecture survives in Surrey from earlier than the 15th century. Wholly or partially surviving houses and barns from that century, with considerable later modifications, include those at Wanborough Manor, Bletchingley, Littleton, East Horsley, Ewhurst, Dockenfield, Lingfield, Limpsfield, Oxted, Crowhurst Place, Haslemere and Old Surrey Hall.
Major examples of 16th-century architecture include the grand mid-century country houses of Loseley Park and Sutton Place and the old building of the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, founded in 1509. A considerable number of smaller houses and public houses of the 16th century are also still standing. From the 17th century the number of surviving buildings proliferates further. Abbot&#x27;s Hospital, founded in 1619, is a grand edifice built in the Tudor style, despite its date. More characteristic examples of major 17th-century building include West Horsley Place, Slyfield Manor, and the Guildhall in Guildford.

== Local government ==

=== History ===
The Local Government Act 1888 reorganised county-level local government throughout England and Wales. Accordingly, the administrative county of Surrey was formed in 1889 when the Provisional Surrey County Council first met, consisting of 19 aldermen and 57 councillors. The county council assumed the administrative responsibilities previously exercised by the county&#x27;s justices in quarter sessions. The county had revised boundaries, with the north east of the historic county bordering the City of London becoming part of a new County of London. These areas now form the London Boroughs of Lambeth, Southwark and Wandsworth, and the Penge area of the London Borough of Bromley. At the same time, the borough of Croydon became a county borough, outside the jurisdiction of the county council.

For purposes other than local government the administrative county of Surrey and county borough of Croydon continued to form a &quot;county of Surrey&quot; to which a Lord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum (chief magistrate) and a High Sheriff were appointed.

Surrey had been administered from Newington since the 1790s, and the county council was initially based in the sessions house there. As Newington was included in the County of London, it lay outside the area administered by the council, and a site for a new county hall within the administrative county was sought. By 1890 six towns were being considered: Epsom, Guildford, Kingston, Redhill, Surbiton and Wimbledon. In 1891 it was decided to build the new County Hall at Kingston, and the building opened in 1893, but this site was also overtaken by the growing London conurbation, and by the 1930s most of the north of the county had been built over, becoming outer suburbs of London, although continuing to form part of Surrey administratively.

In 1960 the report of the Herbert Commission recommended that much of north Surrey (including Kingston and Croydon) be included in a new &quot;Greater London&quot;. These recommendations were enacted in highly modified form in 1965 by the London Government Act 1963. The areas that now form the London Boroughs of Croydon, Kingston, Merton, and Sutton and that part of Richmond south of the River Thames, were transferred from Surrey to Greater London. At the same time part of the county of Middlesex, which had been abolished by the legislation, was added to Surrey. This area now forms the borough of Spelthorne.

Further local government reform under the Local Government Act 1972 took place in 1974. The 1972 Act abolished administrative counties and introduced non-metropolitan counties in their place. The boundaries of the non-metropolitan county of Surrey were similar to those of the administrative county with the exception of Gatwick Airport and some surrounding land which was transferred to West Sussex. It was originally proposed that the parishes of Horley and Charlwood would become part of West Sussex; however this met fierce local opposition and it was reversed by the Charlwood and Horley Act 1974.

=== Today ===
Following the elections of May 2021 the County Councillors&#x27; party affiliations were as follows:
As of 2 May 2019, the Conservative local councillors controlled 4 out of 11 councils in Surrey, the Liberal Democrats controlled Mole Valley, the Residents Associations of Epsom and Ewell controlled Epsom and Ewell, and the remaining 5 are in No Overall Control. Of the five No Overall Control councils, Elmbridge and Waverley were both run by coalitions of Residents and Liberal Democrats, Guildford was run by a Liberal Democrats minority administration, and Tandridge and Woking were both run by Conservative minority administrations.

The Conservatives held all 11 Parliamentary constituencies within the county borders.

== Transport ==

=== Road ===
Three major motorways pass through the county. These are:
*M25 (London Orbital) runs through the county, including a long cutting into the Reigate Hill-Walton Down scarp of the North Downs and has 8 junctions in the county.It connects among others to the M1, M11, M20, M26, M4 and M40. The motorway runs close to Heathrow Airport and the motorway network can be used to access Gatwick, Stansted and Luton Airports and the Channel Tunnel motor vehicle service.
*M3 crosses the north-west of the county. It connects London to Southampton and the South West of England having in Surrey the Sunbury-on-Thames, M25 interchange and the Lightwater and Bagshot junctions.
*M23 (north–south) in effect connects Croydon to Brighton as the dualled A23 trunk road to the north and beyond Crawley. It has junction to a spur to Gatwick Airport on the Surrey/Sussex border. It has a Surrey junction, the M25 Merstham interchange, close to the Reigate M25 junction.

Other major roads include:

*The A3 trunk road from Portsmouth to London. The road now bypasses and historically assisted in the growth of Haslemere, Godalming, Guildford, Esher and Kingston upon Thames. The Hindhead Tunnel bypasses a former bottleneck at Hindhead and the Devil&#x27;s Punchbowl.
*The A24 from London to Littlehampton and Worthing. In Surrey, it passes through or around Ewell, Epsom, Ashtead, Leatherhead and Dorking. It passes Box Hill, near Dorking. Unlike the A3, which is almost completely dual carriageway, the A24 is, apart from a central Surrey stretch, single carriageway; it bypasses Leatherhead, Dorking and Horsham.
*The A31 trunk road heads west from Guildford to Bere Regis via Farnham and is connected to the M3 near Winchester and via the A331 near Aldershot. It is dual carriageway along the Hog&#x27;s Back from the A3 to Farnham. It is one of the ancient routes from London to Winchester, see Pilgrims&#x27; Way.
*The short A331 connects the A31 to the M3. It runs along the Surrey-Hampshire border, bypassing Aldershot, Frimley and Farnborough.

=== Rail ===
Much of Surrey lies within the London commuter belt with regular services into Central London. South Western Railway is the sole train operator in Elmbridge, Runnymede, Spelthorne, Surrey Heath, Woking and Waverley, and the main train operator in the Borough of Guildford, running regular services into and regional services towards the south coast and South west.

Consequently, the towns Staines, Woking, Guildford, Walton-on-Thames, Epsom and Ewell and Reigate and Redhill, statistically the largest examples, are established rapid-transit commuter towns for Central London. The above routes have had a stimulative effect. The relative development of Surrey at the time of the Beeching cuts led to today&#x27;s retention of numerous other commuter routes except the Cranleigh Line, all with direct services to London, including:
# Chertsey Line linking the first two of the above national routes via and 
# New Guildford Line via and from 
# Hampton Court Branch Line to via from Surbiton
# Branch Line via Sunbury

<text>A commodity market is a market that trades in the primary economic sector rather than manufactured products. The primary sector includes agricultural products, energy products, and metals. Soft commodities may be perishable and harvested, while hard commodities are usually mined, such as gold and oil. Futures contracts are the oldest way of investing in commodities. Commodity markets can include physical trading and derivatives trading using spot prices, forwards, futures, and options on futures. Farmers have used a simple form of derivative trading in the commodities market for centuries for price risk management.

A financial derivative is a financial instrument whose value is derived from a commodity termed an underlier. Derivatives are either exchange-traded or over-the-counter (OTC). An increasing number of derivatives are traded via clearing houses some with central counterparty clearing, which provide clearing and settlement services on a futures exchange, as well as off-exchange in the OTC market.

Derivatives such as futures contracts, Swaps (1970s–), and Exchange-traded Commodities (ETC) (2003–) have become the primary trading instruments in commodity markets. Futures are traded on regulated commodities exchanges. Over-the-counter (OTC) contracts are &quot;privately negotiated bilateral contracts entered into between the contracting parties directly&quot;.

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) began to feature commodities in 2003. Gold ETFs are based on &quot;electronic gold&quot; that does not entail the ownership of physical bullion, with its added costs of insurance and storage in repositories such as the London bullion market. According to the World Gold Council, ETFs allow investors to be exposed to the gold market without the risk of price volatility associated with gold as a physical commodity.

== History ==
Commodity-based money and commodity markets in a crude early form are believed to have originated in Sumer between 4500 BC and 4000 BC. Sumerians first used clay tokens sealed in a clay vessel, then clay writing tablets to represent the amount—for example, the number of goats, to be delivered. These promises of time and date of delivery resemble futures contract.

Early civilizations variously used pigs, rare seashells, or other items as commodity money. Since that time traders have sought ways to simplify and standardize trade contracts.

Gold and silver markets evolved in classical civilizations. At first, the precious metals were valued for their beauty and intrinsic worth and were associated with royalty. In time, they were used for trading and were exchanged for other goods and commodities, or for payments of labor. Gold, measured out, then became money. Gold&#x27;s scarcity, its unique density and the way it could be easily melted, shaped, and measured made it a natural trading asset.

Beginning in the late 10th century, commodity markets grew as a mechanism for allocating goods, labor, land and capital across Europe. Between the late 11th and the late 13th century, English urbanization, regional specialization, expanded and improved infrastructure, the increased use of coinage and the proliferation of markets and fairs were evidence of commercialization. The spread of markets is illustrated by the 1466 installation of reliable scales in the villages of Sloten and Osdorp so villagers no longer had to travel to Haarlem or Amsterdam to weigh their locally produced cheese and butter.

The Amsterdam Stock Exchange, often cited as the first stock exchange, originated as a market for the exchange of commodities. Early trading on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange often involved the use of very sophisticated contracts, including short sales, forward contracts, and options. &quot;Trading took place at the Amsterdam Bourse, an open aired venue, which was created as a commodity exchange in 1530 and rebuilt in 1608. Commodity exchanges themselves were a relatively recent invention, existing in only a handful of cities.&quot;

In 1864, in the United States, wheat, corn, cattle, and pigs were widely traded using standard instruments on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), the world&#x27;s oldest futures and options exchange. Other food commodities were added to the Commodity Exchange Act and traded through CBOT in the 1930s and 1940s, expanding the list from grains to include rice, mill feeds, butter, eggs, Irish potatoes and soybeans. Successful commodity markets require broad consensus on product variations to make each commodity acceptable for trading, such as the purity of gold in bullion. Classical civilizations built complex global markets trading gold or silver for spices, cloth, wood and weapons, most of which had standards of quality and timeliness.

Through the 19th century &quot;the exchanges became effective spokesmen for, and innovators of, improvements in transportation, warehousing, and financing, which paved the way to expanded interstate and international trade.&quot;

Reputation and clearing became central concerns, and states that could handle them most effectively developed powerful financial centers.

==Commodity price index==
In 1934, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics began the computation of a daily Commodity price index that became available to the public in 1940. By 1952, the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued a Spot Market Price Index that measured the price movements of &quot;22 sensitive basic commodities whose markets are presumed to be among the first to be influenced by changes in economic conditions. As such, it serves as one early indication of impending changes in business activity.&quot;

==Commodity index fund==
A commodity index fund is a fund whose assets are invested in financial instruments based on or linked to a commodity index. In just about every case the index is in fact a Commodity Futures Index. The first such index was the Dow Jones Commodity Index, which began in 1933. The first practically investable commodity futures index was the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, created in 1991, and known as the &quot;GSCI&quot;. The next was the Dow Jones AIG Commodity Index. It differed from the GSCI primarily in the weights allocated to each commodity. The DJ AIG had mechanisms to periodically limit the weight of any one commodity and to remove commodities whose weights became too small. After AIG&#x27;s financial problems in 2008 the Index rights were sold to UBS and it is now known as the DJUBS index. Other commodity indices include the Reuters / CRB index (which is the old CRB Index as re-structured in 2005) and the Rogers Index.

==Cash commodity==
Cash commodities or &quot;actuals&quot; refer to the physical goods—e.g., wheat, corn, soybeans, crude oil, gold, silver—that someone is buying/selling/trading as distinguished from derivatives.

==Electronic commodities trading==
In traditional stock market exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), most trading activity took place in the trading pits in face-to-face interactions between brokers and dealers in open outcry trading. In 1992 the Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol was introduced, allowing international real-time exchange of information regarding market transactions. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ordered U.S. stock markets to convert from the fractional system to a decimal system by April 2001. Metrification, conversion from the imperial system of measurement to the metrical, increased throughout the 20th century. Eventually FIX-compliant interfaces were adopted globally by commodity exchanges using the FIX Protocol. In 2001 the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (later merged into the CME group, the world&#x27;s largest futures exchange company) launched their FIX-compliant interface.

By 2011, the alternative trading system (ATS) of electronic trading featured computers buying and selling without human dealer intermediation. High-frequency trading (HFT) algorithmic trading, had almost phased out &quot;dinosaur floor-traders&quot;.

===Complexity and interconnectedness of global market===
The robust growth of emerging market economies (EMEs, such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China), beginning in the 1990s, &quot;propelled commodity markets into a supercycle&quot;. The size and diversity of commodity markets expanded internationally, and pension funds and sovereign wealth funds started allocating more capital to commodities, in order to diversify into an asset class with less exposure to currency depreciation.

In 2012, as emerging-market economies slowed down, commodity prices peaked and started to decline. From 2005 through 2013, energy and metals&#x27; real prices remained well above their long-term averages. In 2012, real food prices were their highest since 1982.

The price of gold bullion fell dramatically on 12 April 2013 and analysts frantically sought explanations. Rumors spread that the European Central Bank (ECB) would force Cyprus to sell its gold reserves in response to its financial crisis. Major banks such as Goldman Sachs began immediately to short gold bullion. Investors scrambled to liquidate their exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and margin call selling accelerated. George Gero, precious metals commodities expert at the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) Wealth Management section reported that he had not seen selling of gold bullion as panicked as this in his forty years in commodity markets.

The earliest commodity exchange-traded fund (ETFs), such as SPDR Gold Shares and iShares Silver Trust , actually owned the physical commodities. Similar to these are (palladium) and (platinum). However, most Exchange Traded Commodities (ETCs) implement a futures trading strategy. At the time Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev warned that Russia could sink into recession. He argued that &quot;We live in a dynamic, fast-developing world. It is so global and so complex that we sometimes cannot keep up with the changes&quot;. Analysts have claimed that Russia&#x27;s economy is overly dependent on commodities.

===Contracts in the commodity market===
A Spot contract is an agreement where delivery and payment either takes place immediately, or with a short lag. Physical trading normally involves a visual inspection and is carried out in physical markets such as a farmers market. Derivatives markets, on the other hand, require the existence of agreed standards so that trades can be made without visual inspection.

===Standardization===

US soybean futures do not qualify as &quot;standard grade&quot; if they are &quot;GMO or a mixture of GMO and Non-GMO No. 2 yellow soybeans of Indiana, Ohio and Michigan origin produced in the U.S.A. (Non-screened, stored in silo)&quot;. They are of &quot;deliverable grade&quot; if they are &quot;GMO or a mixture of GMO and Non-GMO No. 2 yellow soybeans of Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin origin produced in the U.S.A. (Non-screened, stored in silo)&quot;. Note the distinction between states, and the need to clearly mention their status as GMO (genetically modified organism) which makes them unacceptable to most organic food buyers.

Similar specifications apply for cotton, orange juice, cocoa, sugar, wheat, corn, barley, pork bellies, milk, feed stuffs, fruits, vegetables, other grains, other beans, hay, other livestock, meats, poultry, eggs, or any other commodity which is so traded.

Standardization has also occurred technologically, as the use of the FIX Protocol by commodities exchanges has allowed trade messages to be sent, received and processed in the same format as stocks or equities. This process began in 2001 when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched a FIX-compliant interface that was adopted by commodity exchanges around the world.

==Derivatives==
Derivatives evolved from simple commodity future contracts into a diverse group of financial instruments that apply to every kind of asset, including mortgages, insurance and many more. Futures contracts, Swaps (1970s–), Exchange-traded Commodities (ETC) (2003–), forward contracts, etc. are examples. They can be traded through formal exchanges or through Over-the-counter (OTC). Commodity market derivatives unlike credit default derivatives, for example, are secured by the physical assets or commodities.

===Forward contracts===
A forward contract is an agreement between two parties to exchange at a fixed future date a given quantity of a commodity for a specific price defined when the contract is finalized. The fixed price is also called forward price. Such forward contracts began as a way of reducing pricing risk in food and agricultural product markets. By agreeing in advance on a price for a future delivery, farmers were able protect their output against a possible fall of market prices and in contrast buyers were able to protect themselves against a possible rise of market prices.

Forward contracts, for example, were used for rice in seventeenth century Japan.

===Futures contract===
Futures contracts are standardized forward contracts that are transacted through an exchange. In futures contracts the buyer and the seller stipulate product, grade, quantity and location and leaving price as the only variable.

Agricultural futures contracts are the oldest, in use in the United States for more than 170 years. Modern futures agreements, began in Chicago in the 1840s, with the appearance of grain elevators. Chicago, centrally located, emerged as the hub between Midwestern farmers and east coast consumer population centers.

===Call options ===
In a call option counterparties enter into a financial contract option where the buyer purchases the right but not the obligation to buy an agreed quantity of a particular commodity or financial instrument (the underlying) from the seller of the option at a certain time (the expiration date) for a certain price (the strike price). The seller (or &quot;writer&quot;) is obligated to sell the commodity or financial instrument should the buyer so decide. The buyer pays a fee (called a premium) for this right.

===Swaps===
A swap is a derivative in which counterparties exchange the cash flows of one party&#x27;s financial instrument for those of the other party&#x27;s financial instrument. They were introduced in the 1970s.

===Exchange-traded commodities (ETCs)===

Exchange-traded commodity is a term used for commodity ETFs (which are funds) or commodity exchange-traded notes (which are notes). These track the performance of an underlying commodity index including total return indices based on a single commodity. They are similar to ETFs and traded and settled exactly like stock funds. ETCs have market maker support with guaranteed liquidity, enabling investors to easily invest in commodities.

They were introduced in 2003.

At first, only professional institutional investors had access, but online exchanges opened some ETC markets to almost anyone. ETCs were introduced partly in response to the tight supply of commodities in 2000, combined with record low inventories and increasing demand from emerging markets such as China and India.

Prior to the introduction of ETCs, by the 1990s ETFs pioneered by Barclays Global Investors (BGI) revolutionized the mutual funds industry. By the end of December 2009 BGI assets hit an all-time high of $1 trillion.

Gold was the first commodity to be securitised through an ETF in the early 1990s, but it was not available for trade until 2003. The idea of a Gold ETF was first officially conceptualised by Benchmark Asset Management Company Private Ltd in India, when they filed a proposal with the Securities and Exchange Board of India in May 2002. The first gold exchange-traded fund was Gold Bullion Securities launched on the ASX in 2003, and the first silver exchange-traded fund was iShares Silver Trust launched on the NYSE in 2006. As of November 2010 a commodity ETF, namely SPDR Gold Shares, was the second-largest ETF by market capitalization.

Generally, commodity ETFs are index funds tracking non-security indices. Because they do not invest in securities, commodity ETFs are not regulated as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940 in the United States, although their public offering is subject to SEC review and they need an SEC no-action letter under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. They may, however, be subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

The earliest commodity ETFs, such as SPDR Gold Shares and iShares Silver Trust , actually owned the physical commodity (e.g., gold and silver bars). Similar to these are (palladium) and (platinum). However, most ETCs implement a futures trading strategy, which may produce quite different results from owning the commodity.

Commodity ETFs trade provide exposure to an increasing range of commodities and commodity indices, including energy, metals, softs and agriculture. Many commodity funds, such as oil roll so-called front-month futures contracts from month to month. This provides exposure to the commodity, but subjects the investor to risks involved in different prices along the &quot;term structure&quot;, such as a high cost to roll.

ETCs in China and India gained in importance due to those countries&#x27; emergence as commodities consumers and producers. China accounted for more than 60% of exchange-traded commodities in 2009, up from 40% the previous year. The global volume of ETCs increased by a 20% in 2010, and 50% since 2008, to around 2.5 billion million contracts.

=== Over-the-counter (OTC) commodities derivatives ===
Over-the-counter (OTC) commodities derivatives trading originally involved two parties, without an exchange. Exchange trading offers greater transparency and regulatory protections. In an OTC trade, the price is not generally made public. OTC commodities derivatives are higher risk but may also lead to higher profits.

Between 2007 and 2010, global physical exports of commodities fell by 2%, while the outstanding value of OTC commodities derivatives declined by two-thirds as investors reduced risk following a five-fold increase in the previous three years.

Money under management more than doubled between 2008 and 2010 to nearly $380 billion. Inflows into the sector totaled over $60 billion in 2010, the second-highest year on record, down from $72 billion the previous year. The bulk of funds went into precious metals and energy products. The growth in prices of many commodities in 2010 contributed to the increase in the value of commodities funds under management.

==Commodities exchange==

A commodities exchange is an exchange where various commodities and derivatives are traded. Most commodity markets across the world trade in agricultural products and other raw materials (like wheat, barley, sugar, maize, cotton, cocoa, coffee, milk products, pork bellies, oil, metals, etc.) and contracts based on them. These contracts can include spot prices, forwards, futures and options on futures. Other sophisticated products may include interest rates, environmental instruments, swaps, or freight contracts.

== Traded commodity classes ==

===Energy===
Energy commodities include crude oil particularly West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and Brent crude oil, natural gas, heating oil, ethanol and purified terephthalic acid. Hedging is a common practice for these commodities.

====Crude oil and natural gas====
For many years, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, a light, sweet crude oil, was the world&#x27;s most-traded commodity. WTI is a grade used as a benchmark in oil pricing. It is the underlying commodity of Chicago Mercantile Exchange&#x27;s oil futures contracts. WTI is often referenced in news reports on oil prices, alongside Brent Crude. WTI is lighter and sweeter than Brent and considerably lighter and sweeter than Dubai or Oman.

From April through October 2012, Brent futures contracts exceeded those for WTI, the longest streak since at least 1995.

Crude oil can be light or heavy. Oil was the first form of energy to be widely traded. Some commodity market speculation is directly related to the stability of certain states, e.g., Iraq, Bahrain, Iran, Venezuela and many others. Most commodities markets are not so tied to the politics of volatile regions.

Oil and gasoline are traded in units of 1,000 barrels (42,000 US gallons). WTI crude oil is traded through NYMEX under trading symbol CL and through Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) under trading symbol WBS. Brent crude oil is traded in through Intercontinental Exchange under trading symbol BRN and on the CME under trading symbol BZ. Gulf Coast Gasoline is traded through NYMEX with the trading symbol of LR. Gasoline (reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending or RBOB) is traded through NYMEX via trading symbol RB. Propane is traded through NYMEX, a subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange since early 2013, via trading symbol PN.

Natural gas is traded through NYMEX in units of 10,000 million BTU with the trading symbol of NG. Heating oil is traded through NYMEX under trading symbol HO.

====Others====
Purified terephthalic acid (PTA) is traded through ZCE in units of 5 tons with the trading symbol of TA. Ethanol is traded at CBOT in units of 29,000 U.S. gal under trading symbols AC (Open Auction) and ZE (Electronic).

===Metals===
====Precious metals====
Precious metals currently traded on the commodity market include gold, platinum, palladium and silver which are sold by the troy ounce. One of the main exchanges for these precious metals is COMEX.

According to the World Gold Council, investments in gold are the primary driver of industry growth. Gold prices are highly volatile, driven by large flows of speculative money.

====Industrial metals====
Industrial metals are sold by the metric ton through the London Metal Exchange and New York Mercantile Exchange. The London Metal Exchange trades include copper, aluminium, lead, tin, aluminium alloy, nickel, cobalt and molybdenum. In 2007, steel began trading on the London Metal Exchange.

Iron ore has been the latest addition to industrial metal derivatives. Deutsche Bank first began offering iron ore swaps in 2008, other banks quickly followed. Since then the size of the market has more than doubled each year between 2008 and 2012.

===Agriculture===

Agricultural commodities include grains, food and fiber as well as livestock and meat, various regulatory bodies define agricultural products.

In 1900, corn acreage was double that of wheat in the United States. But from the 1930s through the 1970s soybean acreage surpassed corn. Early in the 1970s grain and soybean prices, which had been relatively stable, &quot;soared to levels that were unimaginable at the time&quot;. There were a number of factors affecting prices including the &quot;surge in crude oil prices caused by the Arab Oil Embargo in October 1973 (U.S. inflation reached 11% in 1975)&quot;.

On 21 July 2010, United States Congress passed the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act with changes to the definition of agricultural commodity. The operational definition used by Dodd-Frank includes &quot;[a]ll other commodities that are, or once were, or are derived from, living organisms, including plant, animal and aquatic life, which are generally fungible, within their respective classes, and are used primarily for human food, shelter, animal feed, or natural fiber&quot;. Three other categories were explained and listed.

In February 2013, Cornell Law School included lumber, soybeans, oilseeds, livestock (live cattle and hogs), dairy products. Agricultural commodities can include lumber (timber and forests), grains excluding stored grain (wheat, oats, barley, rye, grain sorghum, cotton, flax, forage, tame hay, native grass), vegetables (potatoes, tomatoes, sweet corn, dry beans, dry peas, freezing and canning peas), fruit (citrus such as oranges, apples, grapes) corn, tobacco, rice, peanuts, sugar beets, sugar cane, sunflowers, raisins, nursery crops, nuts, soybean complex, aquacultural fish farm species such as finfish, mollusk, crustacean, aquatic invertebrate, amphibian, reptile, or plant life cultivated in aquatic plant farms.

===Diamonds===
As of 2012, diamond was not traded as a commodity. Institutional investors were repelled by campaign against &quot;blood diamonds&quot;, the monopoly structure of the diamond market and the lack of uniform standards for diamond pricing. In 2012 the SEC reviewed a proposal to create the &quot;first diamond-backed exchange-traded fund&quot; that would trade online in units of one-carat diamonds with a storage vault and delivery point in Antwerp, home of the Antwerp Diamond Bourse. The exchange fund was backed by a company based in New York City called IndexIQ. IndexIQ had already introduced 14 exchange-traded funds since 2008.

According to Citigroup analysts, the annual production of polished diamonds is about $18 billion. Like gold, diamonds are easily authenticated and durable. Diamond prices have been more stable than the metals, as the global diamond monopoly De Beers once held almost 90% (by 2013 reduced to 40%) of the new diamond market.

===Other commodity markets===
Rubber trades on the Singapore Commodity Exchange in units of 1 kg priced in U.S. cents. Palm oil is traded on the Malaysian Ringgit (RM), Bursa Malaysia in units of 1 kg priced in U.S. cents. Wool is traded on the AUD in units of 1 kg. Polypropylene and Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LL) did trade on the London Metal Exchange in units of 1,000 kg priced in USD but was dropped in 2011.

==Impact on inflation==
Fossil fuels and other commodities have been major drivers of inflationary periods, including the 2021-2022 inflation spike exacerbated by the Russian Invasion of Ukraine. Gernot Wagner argues that commodites are undesirable energy sources because of inflationary periods that come with commodity prices.

==Regulatory bodies and policies==
===United States===

In the United States, the principal regulator of commodity and futures markets is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The National Futures Association (NFA) was formed in 1976 and is the futures industry&#x27;s self-regulatory organization. The NFA&#x27;s first regulatory operations began in 1982 and fall under the Commodity Exchange Act of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act.

Dodd–Frank was enacted in response to the 2008 financial crisis. It called for &quot;strong measures to limit speculation in agricultural commodities&quot; calling upon the CFTC to further limit positions and to regulate over-the-counter trades.

===European Union===
Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) is the cornerstone of the European Commission&#x27;s Financial Services Action Plan that regulate operations of the EU financial service markets. It was reviewed in 2012 by the European Parliament (EP) and the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN). The European Parliament adopted a revised version of Mifid II on 26 October 2012 which include &quot;provisions for position limits on commodity derivatives&quot;, aimed at &quot;preventing market abuse&quot; and supporting &quot;orderly pricing and settlement conditions&quot;.

The European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma), based in Paris and formed in 2011, is an &quot;EU-wide financial markets watchdog&quot;. Esma sets position limits on commodity derivatives as described in Mifid II.

The EP voted in favor of stronger regulation of commodity derivative markets in September 2012 to &quot;end abusive speculation in commodity markets&quot; that were &quot;driving global food prices increases and price volatility&quot;. In July 2012, &quot;food prices globally soared by 10 percent&quot; (World Bank 2012). Senior British MEP Arlene McCarthy called for &quot;putting a brake on excessive food speculation and speculating giants profiting from hunger&quot; ending immoral practices that &quot;only serve the interests of profiteers&quot;. In March 2012, EP Member Markus Ferber suggested amendments to the European Commission&#x27;s proposals, intended to strengthen restrictions on high-frequency trading and commodity price manipulation.

<text>A camera obscura (; ) is the natural phenomenon in which the rays of light passing through a small hole into a dark space form an image where they strike a surface, resulting in an inverted (upside down) and reversed (left to right) projection of the view outside.

&quot;Camera obscura&quot; can also refer to analogous constructions such as a darkened room, box or tent in which an exterior image is projected inside or onto a translucent screen viewed from outside. &quot;Camera obscuras&quot; with a lens in the opening have been used since the second half of the 16th century and became popular as aids for drawing and painting. The technology was developed further into the photographic camera in the first half of the 19th century, when &quot;camera obscura&quot; boxes were used to expose light-sensitive materials to the projected image.

The image (or the principle of its projection) of a lensless &quot;camera obscura&quot; is also referred to as a &quot;pinhole image&quot;.

The &quot;camera obscura&quot; was used to study eclipses without the risk of damaging the eyes by looking directly into the Sun. As a drawing aid, it allowed tracing the projected image to produce a highly accurate representation, and was especially appreciated as an easy way to achieve proper graphical perspective.

Before the term &quot;camera obscura&quot; was first used in 1604, other terms were used to refer to the devices: &quot;cubiculum obscurum&quot;, &quot;cubiculum tenebricosum&quot;, &quot;conclave obscurum&quot;, and &quot;locus obscurus&quot;.

A &quot;camera obscura&quot; without a lens but with a very small hole is sometimes referred to as a &quot;pinhole camera&quot;, although this more often refers to simple (homemade) lensless cameras where photographic film or photographic paper is used.

==Physical explanation==
Rays of light travel in straight lines and change when they are reflected and partly absorbed by an object, retaining information about the color and brightness of the surface of that object. Lighted objects reflect rays of light in all directions. A small enough opening in a barrier admits only the rays that travel directly from different points in the scene on the other side, and these rays form an image of that scene where they reach a surface opposite from the opening.

The human eye (and that of many other animals) works much like a &quot;camera obscura&quot;, with rays of light entering an opening (pupil), getting focused through a convex lens and passing a dark chamber before forming an inverted image on a smooth surface (retina). The analogy appeared early in the 16th century and would in the 17th century find common use to illustrate Western theological ideas about God creating the universe as a machine, with a predetermined purpose (just like humans create machines). This had a huge influence on behavioral science, especially on the study of perception and cognition. In this context, it is noteworthy that the projection of inverted images is actually a physical principle of optics that predates the emergence of life (rather than a biological or technological invention) and is not characteristic of all biological vision.

==Technology==
A &quot;camera obscura&quot; consists of a box, tent, or room with a small hole in one side or the top. Light from an external scene passes through the hole and strikes a surface inside, where the scene is reproduced, inverted (upside-down) and reversed (left to right), but with color and perspective preserved.

To produce a reasonably clear projected image, the aperture is typically smaller than 1/100 the distance to the screen.
As the pinhole is made smaller, the image gets sharper, but dimmer. With too small of a pinhole, sharpness is lost because of diffraction. Optimum sharpness is attained with an aperture diameter approximately equal to the geometric mean of the wavelength of light and the distance to the screen.

In practice, &quot;camera obscuras&quot; use a lens rather than a pinhole because it allows a larger aperture, giving a usable brightness while maintaining focus.

If the image is caught on a translucent screen, it can be viewed from the back so that it is no longer reversed (but still upside-down). Using mirrors, it is possible to project a right-side-up image. The projection can also be displayed on a horizontal surface (e.g., a table). The 18th-century overhead version in tents used mirrors inside a kind of periscope on the top of the tent.

The box-type &quot;camera obscura&quot; often has an angled mirror projecting an upright image onto tracing paper placed on its glass top. Although the image is viewed from the back, it is reversed by the mirror.

==History==
===Prehistory to 500 BC: Possible inspiration for prehistoric art and possible use in religious ceremonies, gnomons===
There are theories that occurrences of &quot;camera obscura&quot; effects (through tiny holes in tents or in screens of animal hide) inspired paleolithic cave paintings. Distortions in the shapes of animals in many paleolithic cave artworks might be inspired by distortions seen when the surface on which an image was projected was not straight or not in the right angle.
It is also suggested that &quot;camera obscura&quot; projections could have played a role in Neolithic structures.
Perforated gnomons projecting a pinhole image of the sun were described in the Chinese &quot;Zhoubi Suanjing&quot; writings (1046 BC–256 BC with material added until ). The location of the bright circle can be measured to tell the time of day and year. In Middle Eastern and European cultures its invention was much later attributed to Egyptian astronomer and mathematician Ibn Yunus around 1000 AD.

===500 BC to 500 AD: Earliest written observations===
One of the earliest known written records of a pinhole image is found in the Chinese text called &quot;Mozi&quot;, dated to the 4th century BC, traditionally ascribed to and named for Mozi (circa 470 BC-circa 391 BC), a Chinese philosopher and the founder of Mohist School of Logic. These writings explain how the image in a &quot;collecting-point&quot; or &quot;treasure house&quot; is inverted by an intersecting point (pinhole) that collects the (rays of) light. Light coming from the foot of an illuminated person gets partly hidden below (i.e., strikes below the pinhole) and partly forms the top of the image. Rays from the head are partly hidden above (i.e., strike above the pinhole) and partly form the lower part of the image.

Another early account is provided by Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BC), or possibly a follower of his ideas. Similar to the later 11th-century Middle Eastern scientist Alhazen, Aristotle is also thought to have used &quot;camera obscura&quot; for observing solar eclipses. The formation of pinhole images is touched upon as a subject in the work &quot;Problems – Book XV&quot;, asking: and further on: 

In an attempt to explain the phenomenon, the author described how the light formed two cones; one between the Sun and the aperture and one between the aperture and the Earth. However, the roundness of the image was attributed to the idea that parts of the rays of light (assumed to travel in straight lines) are cut off at the angles in the aperture become so weak that they cannot be noticed.

Many philosophers and scientists of the Western world would ponder the contradiction between light travelling in straight lines and the formation of round spots of light behind differently shaped apertures, until it became generally accepted that the circular and crescent-shapes described in the &quot;problem&quot; were pinhole image projections of the sun.

In his book &quot;Optics&quot; (circa 300 BC, surviving in later manuscripts from around 1000 AD), Euclid proposed mathematical descriptions of vision with &quot;lines drawn directly from the eye pass through a space of great extent&quot; and &quot;the form of the space included in our vision is a cone, with its apex in the eye and its base at the limits of our vision.&quot; Later versions of the text, like Ignazio Danti&#x27;s 1573 annotated translation, would add a description of the &quot;camera obscura&quot; principle to demonstrate Euclid&#x27;s ideas.

===500 to 1000: Earliest experiments, study of light===

In the 6th century, the Byzantine-Greek mathematician and architect Anthemius of Tralles (most famous as a co-architect of the Hagia Sophia) experimented with effects related to the &quot;camera obscura&quot;. Anthemius had a sophisticated understanding of the involved optics, as demonstrated by a light-ray diagram he constructed in 555 AD.

In his optical treatise &quot;De Aspectibus&quot;, Al-Kindi (c. 801–873) wrote about pinhole images to prove that light travels in straight lines.

In the 10th century Yu Chao-Lung supposedly projected images of pagoda models through a small hole onto a screen to study directions and divergence of rays of light.

===1000 to 1400: Optical and astronomical tool, entertainment===

Middle Eastern physicist Ibn al-Haytham (known in the West by the Latinised Alhazen) (965–1040) extensively studied the &quot;camera obscura&quot; phenomenon in the early 11th century.

In his treatise &quot;On the shape of the eclipse&quot; he provided the first experimental and mathematical analysis of the phenomenon. 
He understood the relationship between the focal point and the pinhole.

In his &quot;Book of Optics&quot; (circa 1027), Ibn al-Haytham explained that rays of light travel in straight lines and are distinguished by the body that reflected the rays, writing:
Latin translations of the &quot;Book of Optics&quot; from about 1200 onward seemed very influential in Europe. Among those Ibn al-Haytham is thought to have inspired are Witelo, John Peckham, Roger Bacon, Leonardo da Vinci, René Descartes and Johannes Kepler. However, &quot;On the shape of the eclipse&quot; remained exclusively available in Arabic until the 20th century and no comparable explanation was found in Europe before Kepler addressed it. It were actually al-Kindi&#x27;s work and especially the widely circulated pseudo-Euclidean &quot;De Speculis&quot; that were cited by the early scholars who were interested in pinhole images.

In his 1088 book, &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot;, the Song dynasty Chinese scientist Shen Kuo (1031–1095) compared the focal point of a concave burning-mirror and the &quot;collecting&quot; hole of &quot;camera obscura&quot; phenomena to an oar in a rowlock to explain how the images were inverted:

Shen Kuo also responded to a statement of Duan Chengshi in &quot;Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang&quot; written in about 840 that the inverted image of a Chinese pagoda tower beside a seashore, was inverted because it was reflected by the sea: &quot;This is nonsense. It is a normal principle that the image is inverted after passing through the small hole.&quot;

English statesman and scholastic philosopher Robert Grosseteste (c. 1175 – 9 October 1253) was one of the earliest Europeans who commented on the &quot;camera obscura&quot;.

English philosopher and Franciscan friar Roger Bacon (c. 1219/20 – c. 1292) falsely stated in his &quot;De Multiplicatione Specerium&quot; (1267) that an image projected through a square aperture was round because light would travel in spherical waves and therefore assumed its natural shape after passing through a hole. He is also credited with a manuscript that advised to study solar eclipses safely by observing the rays passing through some round hole and studying the spot of light they form on a surface.

Polish friar, theologian, physicist, mathematician and natural philosopher Vitello wrote about the &quot;camera obscura&quot; in his influential treatise &quot;Perspectiva&quot; (circa 1270–1278), which was largely based on Ibn al-Haytham&#x27;s work.

English archbishop and scholar John Peckham (circa 1230 – 1292) wrote about the &quot;camera obscura&quot; in his &quot;Tractatus de Perspectiva&quot; (circa 1269–1277) and &quot;Perspectiva communis&quot; (circa 1277–79), falsely arguing that light gradually forms the circular shape after passing through the aperture. His writings were influenced by Bacon.

At the end of the 13th century, Arnaldus de Villa Nova is credited with using a &quot;camera obscura&quot; to project live performances for entertainment.

French astronomer Guillaume de Saint-Cloud suggested in his 1292 work &quot;Almanach Planetarum&quot; that the eccentricity of the Sun could be determined with the &quot;camera obscura&quot; from the inverse proportion between the distances and the apparent solar diameters at apogee and perigee.

Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī (1267–1319) described in his 1309 work &quot;Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir&quot; (&quot;The Revision of the Optics&quot;) how he experimented with a glass sphere filled with water in a &quot;camera obscura&quot; with a controlled aperture and found that the colors of the rainbow are phenomena of the decomposition of light.

French Jewish philosopher, mathematician, physicist and astronomer/astrologer Levi ben Gershon (1288–1344) (also known as Gersonides or Leo de Balneolis) made several astronomical observations using a &quot;camera obscura&quot; with a Jacob&#x27;s staff, describing methods to measure the angular diameters of the Sun, the Moon and the bright planets Venus and Jupiter. He determined the eccentricity of the Sun based on his observations of the summer and winter solstices in 1334. Levi also noted how the size of the aperture determined the size of the projected image. He wrote about his findings in Hebrew in his treatise &quot;Sefer Milhamot Ha-Shem&quot; (&quot;The Wars of the Lord&quot;) Book V Chapters 5 and 9.

===1450 to 1600: Depiction, lenses, drawing aid, mirrors===

Italian polymath Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), familiar with the work of Alhazen in Latin translation and having extensively studied the physics and physiological aspects of optics, wrote the oldest known clear description of the &quot;camera obscura&quot;, in 1502 (found in the &quot;Codex Atlanticus&quot;, translated from Latin):

These descriptions, however, would remain unknown until Venturi deciphered and published them in 1797.

Da Vinci was clearly very interested in the &quot;camera obscura&quot;: over the years he drew approximately 270 diagrams of the &quot;camera obscura&quot; in his notebooks. He systematically experimented with various shapes and sizes of apertures and with multiple apertures (1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 24, 28 and 32). He compared the working of the eye to that of the &quot;camera obscura&quot; and seemed especially interested in its capability of demonstrating basic principles of optics: the inversion of images through the pinhole or pupil, the non-interference of images and the fact that images are &quot;all in all and all in every part&quot;.
The oldest known published drawing of a &quot;camera obscura&quot; is found in Dutch physician, mathematician and instrument maker Gemma Frisius’ 1545 book &quot;De Radio Astronomica et Geometrica&quot;, in which he described and illustrated how he used the &quot;camera obscura&quot; to study the solar eclipse of 24 January 1544

Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano described using a glass disc – probably a biconvex lens – in a &quot;camera obscura&quot; in his 1550 book &quot;De subtilitate, vol. I, Libri IV&quot;. He suggested to use it to view &quot;what takes place in the street when the sun shines&quot; and advised to use a very white sheet of paper as a projection screen so the colours would not be dull.

Sicilian mathematician and astronomer Francesco Maurolico (1494–1575) answered Aristotle&#x27;s problem how sunlight that shines through rectangular holes can form round spots of light or crescent-shaped spots during an eclipse in his treatise &quot;Photismi de lumine et umbra&quot; (1521–1554). However this wasn&#x27;t published before 1611, after Johannes Kepler had published similar findings of his own.

Italian polymath Giambattista della Porta described the &quot;camera obscura&quot;, which he called &quot;camera obscura&quot;, in the 1558 first edition of his book series &quot;Magia Naturalis&quot;. He suggested to use a convex lens to project the image onto paper and to use this as a drawing aid. Della Porta compared the human eye to the &quot;camera obscura&quot;: &quot;For the image is let into the eye through the eyeball just as here through the window&quot;. The popularity of Della Porta&#x27;s books helped spread knowledge of the &quot;camera obscura&quot;.

In his 1567 work &quot;La Pratica della Perspettiva&quot; Venetian nobleman Daniele Barbaro (1513-1570) described using a &quot;camera obscura&quot; with a biconvex lens as a drawing aid and points out that the picture is more vivid if the lens is covered as much as to leave a circumference in the middle.
In his influential and meticulously annotated Latin edition of the works of Ibn al-Haytham and Witelo, (1572), German mathematician Friedrich Risner proposed a portable &quot;camera obscura&quot; drawing aid; a lightweight wooden hut with lenses in each of its four walls that would project images of the surroundings on a paper cube in the middle. The construction could be carried on two wooden poles. A very similar setup was illustrated in 1645 in Athanasius Kircher&#x27;s influential book &quot;Ars Magna Lucis Et Umbrae&quot;.

Around 1575 Italian Dominican priest, mathematician, astronomer, and cosmographer Ignazio Danti designed a &quot;camera obscura&quot; gnomon and a meridian line for the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella, Florence, and he later had a massive gnomon built in the San Petronio Basilica in Bologna. The gnomon was used to study the movements of the Sun during the year and helped in determining the new Gregorian calendar for which Danti took place in the commission appointed by Pope Gregorius XIII and instituted in 1582.

In his 1585 book &quot;Diversarum Speculationum Mathematicarum&quot; Venetian mathematician Giambattista Benedetti proposed to use a mirror in a 45-degree angle to project the image upright. This leaves the image reversed, but would become common practice in later &quot;camera obscura&quot; boxes.

Giambattista della Porta added a &quot;lenticular crystal&quot; or biconvex lens to the &quot;camera obscura&quot; description in the 1589 second edition of &quot;Magia Naturalis&quot;. He also described use of the &quot;camera obscura&quot; to project hunting scenes, banquets, battles, plays, or anything desired on white sheets. Trees, forests, rivers, mountains &quot;that are really so, or made by Art, of Wood, or some other matter&quot; could be arranged on a plain in the sunshine on the other side of the &quot;camera obscura&quot; wall. Little children and animals (for instance handmade deer, wild boars, rhinos, elephants, and lions) could perform in this set. &quot;Then, by degrees, they must appear, as coming out of their dens, upon the Plain: The Hunter he must come with his hunting Pole, Nets, Arrows, and other necessaries, that may represent hunting: Let there be Horns, Cornets, Trumpets sounded: those that are in the Chamber shall see Trees, Animals, Hunters Faces, and all the rest so plainly, that they cannot tell whether they be true or delusions: Swords drawn will glister in at the hole, that they will make people almost afraid.&quot; 
Della Porta claimed to have shown such spectacles often to his friends. They admired it very much and could hardly be convinced by della Porta&#x27;s explanations that what they had seen was really an optical trick.

===1600 to 1650: Name coined, &quot;camera obscura&quot; telescopy, portable drawing aid in tents and boxes===
The earliest use of the term &quot;camera obscura&quot; is found in the 1604 book &quot;Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena&quot; by German mathematician, astronomer, and astrologer Johannes Kepler. Kepler discovered the working of the &quot;camera obscura&quot; by recreating its principle with a book replacing a shining body and sending threads from its edges through a many-cornered aperture in a table onto the floor where the threads recreated the shape of the book. He also realized that images are &quot;painted&quot; inverted and reversed on the retina of the eye and figured that this is somehow corrected by the brain. 
In 1607, Kepler studied the Sun in his &quot;camera obscura&quot; and noticed a sunspot, but he thought it was Mercury transiting the Sun.
In his 1611 book &quot;Dioptrice&quot;, Kepler described how the projected image of the &quot;camera obscura&quot; can be improved and reverted with a lens. It is believed he later used a telescope with three lenses to revert the image in the &quot;camera obscura&quot;.

In 1611, Frisian/German astronomers David and Johannes Fabricius (father and son) studied sunspots with a &quot;camera obscura&quot;, after realizing looking at the Sun directly with the telescope could damage their eyes. They are thought to have combined the telescope and the &quot;camera obscura&quot; into &quot;camera obscura&quot; telescopy.

In 1612, Italian mathematician Benedetto Castelli wrote to his mentor, the Italian astronomer, physicist, engineer, philosopher, and mathematician Galileo Galilei about projecting images of the Sun through a telescope (invented in 1608) to study the recently discovered sunspots. Galilei wrote about Castelli&#x27;s technique to the German Jesuit priest, physicist, and astronomer Christoph Scheiner.
From 1612 to at least 1630, Christoph Scheiner would keep on studying sunspots and constructing new telescopic solar-projection systems. He called these &quot;Heliotropii Telioscopici&quot;, later contracted to helioscope. For his helioscope studies, Scheiner built a box around the viewing/projecting end of the telescope, which can be seen as the oldest known version of a box-type &quot;camera obscura&quot;. Scheiner also made a portable &quot;camera obscura&quot;.

In his 1613 book &quot;Opticorum Libri Sex&quot; Belgian Jesuit mathematician, physicist, and architect François d&#x27;Aguilon described how some charlatans cheated people out of their money by claiming they knew necromancy and would raise the specters of the devil from hell to show them to the audience inside a dark room. The image of an assistant with a devil&#x27;s mask was projected through a lens into the dark room, scaring the uneducated spectators.
By 1620 Kepler used a portable &quot;camera obscura&quot; tent with a modified telescope to draw landscapes. It could be turned around to capture the surroundings in parts.

Dutch inventor Cornelis Drebbel is thought to have constructed a box-type &quot;camera obscura&quot; which corrected the inversion of the projected image. In 1622, he sold one to the Dutch poet, composer, and diplomat Constantijn Huygens who used it to paint and recommended it to his artist friends. Huygens wrote to his parents (translated from French):
German Orientalist, mathematician, inventor, poet, and librarian Daniel Schwenter wrote in his 1636 book &quot;Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae&quot; about an instrument that a man from Pappenheim had shown him, which enabled movement of a lens to project more from a scene through a &quot;camera obscura&quot;. It consisted of a ball as big as a fist, through which a hole (AB) was made with a lens attached on one side (B). This ball was placed inside two-halves of part of a hollow ball that were then glued together (CD), in which it could be turned around. This device was attached to a wall of the &quot;camera obscura&quot; (EF). This universal joint mechanism was later called a scioptic ball.

In his 1637 book &quot;Dioptrique&quot; French philosopher, mathematician and scientist René Descartes suggested placing an eye of a recently dead man (or if a dead man was unavailable, the eye of an ox) into an opening in a darkened room and scraping away the flesh at the back until one could see the inverted image formed on the retina.
Italian Jesuit philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer Mario Bettini wrote about making a &quot;camera obscura&quot; with twelve holes in his &quot;Apiaria universae philosophiae mathematicae&quot; (1642). When a foot soldier would stand in front of the camera, a twelve-person army of soldiers making the same movements would be projected.

French mathematician, Minim friar, and painter of anamorphic art Jean-François Nicéron (1613–1646) wrote about the &quot;camera obscura&quot; with convex lenses. He explained how the &quot;camera obscura&quot; could be used by painters to achieve perfect perspective in their work. He also complained how charlatans abused the &quot;camera obscura&quot; to fool witless spectators and make them believe that the projections were magic or occult science. These writings were published in a posthumous version of &quot;La Perspective Curieuse&quot; (1652).

===1650 to 1800: Introduction of the magic lantern, popular portable box-type drawing aid, painting aid===
The use of the &quot;camera obscura&quot; to project special shows to entertain an audience seems to have remained very rare. A description of what was most likely such a show in 1656 in France, was penned by the poet Jean Loret, who expressed how rare and novel it was. The Parisian society were presented with upside-down images of palaces, ballet dancing and battling with swords. Loret felt somewhat frustrated that he did not know the secret that made this spectacle possible. There are several clues that this may have been a &quot;camera obscura&quot; show, rather than a very early magic lantern show, especially in the upside-down image and Loret&#x27;s surprise that the energetic movements made no sound.

German Jesuit scientist Gaspar Schott heard from a traveler about a small &quot;camera obscura&quot; device he had seen in Spain, which one could carry under one arm and could be hidden under a coat. He then constructed his own sliding box &quot;camera obscura&quot;, which could focus by sliding a wooden box part fitted inside another wooden box part. He wrote about this in his 1657 &quot;Magia universalis naturæ et artis&quot; (volume 1 – book 4 &quot;Magia Optica&quot; pages 199–201).

By 1659 the magic lantern was introduced and partly replaced the &quot;camera obscura&quot; as a projection device, while the &quot;camera obscura&quot; mostly remained popular as a drawing aid. The magic lantern can be regarded as a (box-type) &quot;camera obscura&quot; device that projects images rather than actual scenes. In 1668, Robert Hooke described the difference for an installation to project the delightful &quot;various apparitions and disappearances, the motions, changes and actions&quot; by means of a broad convex-glass in a &quot;camera obscura&quot; setup: &quot;if the picture be transparent, reflect the rays of the sun so as that they may pass through it towards the place where it is to be represented; and let the picture be encompassed on every side with a board or cloth that no rays may pass beside it. If the object be a statue or some living creature, then it must be very much enlightened by casting the sun beams on it by refraction, reflexion, or both.&quot; For models that can&#x27;t be inverted, like living animals or candles, he advised: &quot;let two large glasses of convenient spheres be placed at appropriate distances&quot;.

The 17th century Dutch Masters, such as Johannes Vermeer, were known for their magnificent attention to detail. It has been widely speculated that they made use of the &quot;camera obscura&quot;, but the extent of their use by artists at this period remains a matter of fierce contention, recently revived by the Hockney–Falco thesis.
German philosopher Johann Sturm published an illustrated article about the construction of a portable &quot;camera obscura&quot; box with a 45° mirror and an oiled paper screen in the first volume of the proceedings of the Collegium Curiosum, &quot;Collegium Experimentale, sive Curiosum&quot; (1676).

Johann Zahn&#x27;s &quot;Oculus Artificialis Teledioptricus Sive Telescopium&quot;, published in 1685, contains many descriptions, diagrams, illustrations and sketches of both the &quot;camera obscura&quot; and the magic lantern. A hand-held device with a mirror-reflex mechanism was first proposed by Johann Zahn in 1685, a design that would later be used in photographic cameras.

The scientist Robert Hooke presented a paper in 1694 to the Royal Society, in which he described a portable &quot;camera obscura&quot;. It was a cone-shaped box which fit onto the head and shoulders of its user.

From the beginning of the 18th century, craftsmen and opticians would make &quot;camera obscura&quot; devices in the shape of books, which were much appreciated by lovers of optical devices.

One chapter in the Conte Algarotti&#x27;s &quot;Saggio sopra Pittura&quot; (1764) is dedicated to the use of a &quot;camera obscura&quot; (&quot;optic chamber&quot;) in painting.

By the 18th century, following developments by Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke, more easily portable models in boxes became available. These were extensively used by amateur artists while on their travels, but they were also employed by professionals, including Paul Sandby and Joshua Reynolds, whose camera (disguised as a book) is now in the Science Museum in London. Such cameras were later adapted by Joseph Nicephore Niepce, Louis Daguerre and William Fox Talbot for creating the first photographs.


==Role in the modern age==

While the technical principles of the &quot;camera obscura&quot; have been known since antiquity, the broad use of the technical concept in producing images with a linear perspective in paintings, maps, theatre setups, and architectural, and, later, photographic images and movies started in the Western Renaissance and the scientific revolution. Although Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) had already observed an optical effect and developed a pioneering theory of the refraction of light, he was less interested in producing images with it (compare Hans Belting 2005); the society he lived in was even hostile (compare Aniconism in Islam) toward personal images.

Western artists and philosophers used the Middle Eastern findings in new frameworks of epistemic relevance. For example, Leonardo da Vinci used the &quot;camera obscura&quot; as a model of the eye, René Descartes for eye and mind, and John Locke started to use the &quot;camera obscura&quot; as a metaphor of human understanding per se. The modern use of the &quot;camera obscura&quot; as an epistemic machine had important side effects for science.

While the use of the &quot;camera obscura&quot; has waxed and waned, one can still be built using a few simple items: a box, tracing paper, tape, foil, a box cutter, a pencil, and a blanket to keep out the light. Homemade &quot;camera obscura&quot; are popular primary- and secondary-school science or art projects.

In 1827, critic Vergnaud complained about the frequent use of &quot;camera obscura&quot; in producing many of the paintings at that year&#x27;s Salon exhibition in Paris: &quot;Is the public to blame, the artists, or the jury, when history paintings, already rare, are sacrificed to genre painting, and what genre at that!... that of the &quot;camera obscura&quot;.&quot; (translated from French)

British photographer Richard Learoyd has specialized in making pictures of his models and motifs with a &quot;camera obscura&quot; instead of a modern camera, combining it with the ilfochrome process which creates large grainless prints.

Other contemporary visual artists who have explicitly used &quot;camera obscura&quot; in their artworks include James Turrell, Abelardo Morell, Minnie Weisz, Robert Calafiore, Vera Lutter, Marja Pirilä, and Shi Guorui.

=== Digital cameras ===

Camera obscura principle pinhole objectives machined out of aluminium are commercially available. As the luminosity of the image is very weak in the phenomenon, long exposure times or high sensitivity must be used in digital photography. The resulting image appears hazy and the image is not that sharp, even if the objective is attached to a state of the art camera body.

<text>The National Liberation Army (NLA; , UÇK; , ONA), also known as the Macedonian UÇK (; ), was an ethnic Albanian militant militia that operated in the Republic of Macedonia in 2001 and was closely associated with the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). Following the 2001 insurgency in Macedonia, it was disarmed through the Ohrid Framework Agreement, which gave greater rights and autonomy to the state&#x27;s Macedonian Albanians.

==Background and foundation==
In 1992–1993, ethnic Albanians created the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) which started attacking police forces and secret-service officials who abused Albanian civilians in 1995. Starting in 1998, the KLA was involved in frontal battle, with increasing numbers of Yugoslav security forces. Escalating tensions led to the Kosovo War in February 1998.

After the end of the Kosovo War in 1999 with the signing of the Kumanovo agreement, a 5-kilometer-wide Ground Safety Zone (GSZ) was created. It served as a buffer zone between the Yugoslav Army and the Kosovo Force (KFOR). In June 1999, a new Albanian militant insurgent group was formed under the Liberation Army of Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac (UÇPMB), which started training in the GSZ. The group began attacking Serbian civilians and police, which escalated into an insurgency.

The NLA was founded in 1999 and led by former KLA commander Ali Ahmeti, a nephew of one of the founders of the KLA. Ahmeti organized the NLA from former KLA and UÇPMB fighters from Kosovo, Albanian insurgents from the Liberation Army of Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac in Serbia, young Albanian radicals, nationalists from Macedonia, and foreign mercenaries. With the signing of the Končulj Agreement in May 2001, the former KLA and UÇPMB fighters next moved to western Macedonia where the NLA was established, which fought against the Macedonian government in 2001. The acronym was the same as the KLA&#x27;s in Albanian. A NLA communiqué from 30 January 2000 claimed responsibility for attacks on police stations in Skopje and Oslomej.

== 2001 insurgency in Macedonia==

The NLA operated secretly until it began openly engaging the Macedonian military and police. Per the NLA, the goal of the insurgency was to secure greater rights for Albanians. The NLA also demanded a confederate Macedonia. Senior NLA commanders insisted that &quot;We do not want to endanger the stability and the territorial integrity of Macedonia, but we will fight a guerrilla war until we have won our basic rights, until we are accepted as an equal people inside Macedonia.&quot; The Macedonian government claimed the NLA was a terrorist organization consisting primarily of KLA fighters, lacking domestic legitimacy and seeking secession or a Greater Albania. 

On 22 January 2001, the NLA attacked a police station in Tearce, killing 1 and injuring 3. After the attack, the NLA began to carry out attacks on Macedonian security forces using light weapons. In February, the NLA entered the village of Tanuševci and the conflict expanded to the Kumanovo, Lipkovo and Tetovo region. By the start of March, the NLA had taken effective control of a large swathe of northern and western Macedonia and had come within 12 miles of the capital Skopje.

In March, NLA members failed to take the city of Tetovo in an open attack, but controlled the hills and mountains between Tetovo and Kosovo. In 9 March, the NLA ambushed a police convoy consisting of deputy interior minister Refet Elmazi and secretary of state for interior affairs Ljube Boškoski. In April, the NLA committed an ambush near Vejce on eight soldiers. On 3 May, a Macedonian government counteroffensive failed in the Kumanovo area. By 8 June, the rebels took Aračinovo, a village outside of Skopje. The NLA threatened to bomb strategic targets, such as the Skopje International Airport and the oil refinery, Okta AD. A ceasefire was mediated by the EU and the NLA was evacuated by NATO to a village under its control, Nikuštak. On 7 August, five NLA rebels were killed in Skopje in a police raid. The NLA ambushed Macedonian reservists near Karpalak on the next day. On 13 August, the Ohrid Agreement was signed between ethnic Macedonian and Albanian representatives, ending the conflict. NLA&#x27;s leadership was not involved in the negotiations for the agreement but they accepted it.

===Composition and military capabilities===
Approximately 400 young Albanian men from Macedonia, including figures like Ali Ahmeti, Gëzim Ostreni, and Xhezair Shaqiri, had fought within KLA&#x27;s ranks. Many of these fighters later established the NLA, recruiting additional members from Kosovar Albanians, particularly from Prizren (a former stronghold of Ahmeti) and southeastern Kosovo, such as the municipality of Vitina, particularly the village of Debelldeh, which was a key stronghold of the NLA in Kosovo. Per NLA, about 80% of its fighters were local Albanians from Macedonia. The Macedonian government denied that local ethnic Albanians had joined the NLA, while foreign observers and ethnic Albanians in Macedonia argued that the NLA had gained significant support from the local Albanian population.

Ali Ahmeti stated that the NLA comprised 5,000 members during the conflict, including those in logistical roles. Other sources suggest the NLA claimed to have the capacity to mobilize a larger force of up to 16,000, likely to intimidate the government. The Macedonian government estimated around 7,000 rebels, while Kusovac provided a more modest figure of 2,000–2,500 &#x27;full-time&#x27; combatants. Nonetheless, the NLA had a broader network of supporters involved in tasks such as reconnaissance, patrolling, communications, and logistics. Interviews with former combatants in the spring and summer of 2003 revealed that the NLA&#x27;s total strength at its peak was between 5,000 and 5,500 troops. However, a distinction was noted between the fully armed front-line forces, numbering 2,800–3,500, and the remaining 2,000 personnel serving as rear-echelon support and logistics staff. According to the combatants, rear-echelon members, if armed at all, typically carried only light weapons, such as pistols. For instance, the NLA reported having two field hospitals staffed by 550 medical personnel, all of whom were unarmed. Members of the Albanian community in Switzerland and Germany raised funding for the NLA through a so-called National Liberation fund (&quot;Liria Komberate&quot;). The International Crisis Group argued that the NLA was the recipient of funding and weapons linked to criminal groups.

As with the KLA, they were fairly lightly armed – generally with small arms and mortars – though there were later reports that they had acquired SAM-7 anti-aircraft missiles. As the war progressed the rebels managed to acquire heavy weapons including T-55 tanks and armoured personnel carriers captured from Macedonian government forces. The NLA also had thousands of land and anti-tank mines.

=== Organization ===
The NLA claimed to have six brigades active within Macedonia. The 111th, 113th, and 114th Brigades operated in the Skopska Crna Gora (Karadak) region, while the 112th Brigade commanded several battalions in the Tetovo area. The 116th Brigade was responsible for the Gostivar region, and the 115th Brigade was positioned in the northwest of Skopje, including Raduša. In contrast, an OSCE official stated that the NLA had a total of 10 brigades but deployed only the six mentioned above, suggesting that the NLA possessed significant reserve potential.

The six brigades, each with their own commanders were:

* 111th Brigade, unknown commanders
* 112th Brigade &quot;Mujdin Aliu&quot;, commanded by Rahim Beqiri
* 113th Brigade &quot;Ismet Jashari&quot;, commanded by Xhezair Shaqiri
* 114th Brigade &quot;Fadil Nimani&quot;, commanded by Nazim Bushi
* 115th Brigade &quot;Radusha&quot;, commanded by Rafiz Aliti
* 116th Brigade &quot;Tahir Sinani&quot;, commanded by Tahir Sinani

=== NLA veterans in politics ===
Some former leaders of the NLA have taken positions in politics in North Macedonia.

* Ali Ahmeti, founder of the NLA, is the leader and founder of the third largest political party in North Macedonia, called the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI).
* Gëzim Ostreni, former NLA general, created the political party &quot;Unity&quot;, along with Zulfi Adeli. The party was later merged with the Alliance for Albanians (AA) political party in North Macedonia.
* Jakup Asipi, former NLA commander, was elected to be the mufti for the municipalities of Kumanovo and Lipkovo.
* Talat Xhaferi, former NLA commander, who was the Minister of Defense of Macedonia from 2013 to 2014, president of the Assembly of North Macedonia from 2017 to 2024, prime minister of North Macedonia from 28 January to 23 June 2024.

===Alleged war crimes===

According to Human Rights Watch: &quot;Ethnic Albanian rebels in Macedonia tortured, sexually abused road workers after abducting them from the Skopje–Tetovo highway.&quot; Dozens of ethnic Macedonians were kidnapped. Per Amnesty International, while many were released after a short time, 12 people apparently remained missing after the NLA released 14 others in late September. In October, reports suggested that the 12 may have been killed and buried in mass graves near Neprošteno. Another incident is the Vejce ambush, where Albanian guerrillas ambushed and killed eight Macedonian special operatives, part of a patrol of 16 special operatives.

The Macedonian government accused the NLA of bombing a 13th-century Orthodox monastery Sveti Atanasij in the village of Lešok on 21 August 2001. The attack occurred at around 3 am Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The interior had been gratified and destroyed. NATO military experts said that &quot;the fact that the battery was lying within an area spattered by rubble and wreckage seemed to suggest that it was detonated using a relatively sophisticated timer device;&quot;.

The Macedonian government referred four cases against the NLA to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in 2002 for investigation:
*&#x27;Mavrovo Road Workers&#x27; case – Five road workers from the Mavrovo construction company were abducted on 7 August 2001 and were tortured for eight hours.
*&#x27;Lipkovo Dam&#x27; case – The valves of the Kumanovo water supply system at Lipkovo dam were closed down for 40 days in an area under NLA&#x27;s control, leaving 120,000 citizens without drinking water.
*&#x27;Neproshteno&#x27; case – 12 civilians were abducted from various locations around Tetovo in July 2001.
*&#x27;NLA Leadership&#x27; case – Command responsibility with a combined charge of multiple war crimes, for which NLA&#x27;s leadership was accused.
The ICTY returned the cases to Macedonia in 2008.

== Ceasefire and disarmament ==

Under the Ohrid Agreement, the Macedonian government pledged to improve the rights of the Albanian population, that make up around 20% of the population. Those rights include making Albanian an official language, increasing the participation of ethnic Albanians in government institutions, police and the army. The Macedonian government also agreed to a new model of decentralization.

The Albanian side agreed to give up any separatist demands and to fully recognize all Macedonian institutions. In addition, the NLA was to disarm and hand over their weapons to a NATO force. The exact number of NLA rebels who were killed is unknown. Per the Macedonian Ministry of Interior, the NLA killed ten civilians.

Operation Essential Harvest was officially launched on 22 August and effectively started on 27 August. This 30-day mission was to initially involve approximately 3,500 NATO troops, a number that went up to 4,200 NATO troops and Macedonian troops, to disarm the NLA and destroy their weapons. In September, the NLA disbanded.

==Later developments==

In Albanian communities across North Macedonia, monuments dedicated to the NLA were erected. In 2002, the Macedonian parliament approved a general amnesty for former ethnic Albanian insurgents but it only applied for Macedonian citizens. On 26 March 2002, Albanian National Army members attacked former NLA members in the village and former NLA stronghold Mala Rečica near Tetovo. The shootout lasted around two hours and a half. According to some news sources, 1 to 2 militants died in this skirmish. Ali Ahmeti later formed the Democratic Union for Integration (which also included former NLA members), which has been the biggest Albanian political party in North Macedonia.

In April 2010, a weapon cache believed to be intended for group actions was discovered near the border with Serbia; it included uniforms with UÇK marks.

A movement calling itself the NLA claimed responsibility for the 2014 Skopje government attack. The organization, in the letter signed by &quot;Kushtrimi&quot; to the government, claimed that the &quot;Hasan Prishtina&quot; elite force hit the government building in a coordinated action. The organization claims it is dissatisfied with the 2001 Ohrid Agreement.

Bomb attacks were carried out on 9 December 2014 at 8 p.m. near Macedonian police stations in Kumanovo and Tetovo. The Ministry of the Interior announced that in both cases it was not about bombs, but about a kind of explosive device. there were no injuries and no major damage. A private car parked near the train station was damaged. After the attacks, an organization claiming to be the NLA claimed responsibility.

On 21 April 2015, a group of 40 armed men with UÇK patches attacked a border police station at Gošince. The group tied the policemen up and beat them, then stole their arms and communication devices. Before they left for Kosovo, they issued the message: &quot;We are from UÇK. Tell them that neither Ali Ahmeti nor Nikola Gruevski can save you. We do not want any framework agreement and if we see you here again, we will kill you. We want our own state.&quot;

On 9–10 May 2015, a series of shootouts happened in Kumanovo between Macedonian police and a group that claimed it was the NLA. Between 50-70 militants were present during the fighting. Ten militants were killed, and reports state they wore uniforms with UÇK insignia, with 30 more being arrested. According to Nikola Gruevski the armed group did not have the support of members of the Albanian minority contrary to the 2001 conflict.

<doc id="48203" wikidata="Q103184" url="?curid=48203" title="Article (grammar)">
<text>In grammar, an article is any member of a class of dedicated words that are used with noun phrases to mark the identifiability of the referents of the noun phrases. The category of articles constitutes a part of speech.

In English, both &quot;the&quot; and &quot;a(n)&quot; are articles, which combine with nouns to form noun phrases. Articles typically specify the grammatical definiteness of the noun phrase, but in many languages, they carry additional grammatical information such as gender, number, and case. Articles are part of a broader category called determiners, which also include demonstratives, possessive determiners, and quantifiers. In linguistic interlinear glossing, articles are abbreviated as .

== Types of article ==

===Definite article===

A definite article is an article that marks a definite noun phrase. Definite articles, such as the English &quot;the,&quot; are used to refer to a particular member of a group. It may be something that the speaker has already mentioned, or it may be otherwise something uniquely specified.

For example, Sentence 1 uses the definite article and thus, expresses a request for a particular book. In contrast, Sentence 2 uses an indefinite article and thus, conveys that the speaker would be satisfied with any book.

# Give me &quot;the&quot; book.
# Give me &quot;a&quot; book.

The definite article can also be used in English to indicate a specific class among other classes:
: The cabbage white butterfly lays its eggs on members of the Brassica &quot;genus.&quot;
However, recent developments show that definite articles are morphological elements linked to certain noun types due to lexicalization. Under this point of view, definiteness does not play a role in the selection of a definite article more than the lexical entry attached to the article.

Some languages (such as the continental North Germanic languages, Bulgarian or Romanian) have definite articles only as suffixes.

===Indefinite article===
An indefinite article is an article that marks an indefinite noun phrase. Indefinite articles are those such as English &quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot;, which do not refer to a specific identifiable entity. Indefinites are commonly used to introduce a new discourse referent which can be referred back to in subsequent discussion:

# A monster ate a cookie. His name is Cookie Monster.

Indefinites can also be used to generalize over entities who have some property in common:

# A cookie is a wonderful thing to eat.

Indefinites can also be used to refer to specific entities whose precise identity is unknown or unimportant.

# A monster must have broken into my house last night and eaten all my cookies.
# A friend of mine told me that happens frequently to people who live on Sesame Street.

Indefinites also have predicative uses:

# Leaving my door unlocked was a bad decision.

Indefinite noun phrases are widely studied within linguistics, in particular because of their ability to take exceptional scope.

===Proper article===

A proper article indicates that its noun is proper, and refers to a unique entity. It may be the name of a person, the name of a place, the name of a planet, etc. The Māori language has the proper article , which is used for personal nouns; so, &quot;&quot; means &quot;Peter&quot;. In Māori, when the personal nouns have the definite or indefinite article as an important part of it, both articles are present; for example, the phrase &quot;&quot;, which contains both the proper article and the definite article refers to the person name Te Rauparaha.

The definite article is sometimes also used with proper names, which are already specified by definition (there &quot;is&quot; just one of them). For example: &quot;the Amazon, the Hebrides&quot;. In these cases, the definite article may be considered superfluous. Its presence can be accounted for by the assumption that they are shorthand for a longer phrase in which the name is a specifier, i.e. &quot;the Amazon River&quot;, &quot;the Hebridean Islands&quot;. Where the nouns in such longer phrases cannot be omitted, the definite article is universally kept: &quot;the United States&quot;, &quot;the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;.

This distinction can sometimes become a political matter: the former usage &quot;the Ukraine&quot; stressed the word&#x27;s Russian meaning of &quot;borderlands&quot;; as Ukraine became a fully independent state following the collapse of the Soviet Union, it requested that formal mentions of its name omit the article. Similar shifts in usage have occurred in the names of Sudan and both Congo (Brazzaville) and Congo (Kinshasa); a move in the other direction occurred with The Gambia. In certain languages, such as French and Italian, definite articles are used with all or most names of countries: , , ; , , .

Some languages use definite articles with personal names, as in Portuguese (, literally: &quot;the Maria&quot;), Greek (, , , ), and Catalan (, /). Such usage also occurs colloquially or dialectally in Spanish, German, French, Italian and other languages. In Hungarian, the colloquial use of definite articles with personal names, though widespread, is considered to be a Germanism.

The definite article sometimes appears in American English nicknames such as &quot;the Donald&quot;, referring to current president Donald Trump, and &quot;the Gipper&quot;, referring to former president Ronald Reagan.

===Partitive article===
A partitive article is a type of article, sometimes viewed as a type of indefinite article, used with a mass noun such as &quot;water&quot;, to indicate a non-specific quantity of it. Partitive articles are a class of determiner; they are used in French and Italian in addition to definite and indefinite articles. (In Finnish and Estonian, the partitive is indicated by inflection.) The nearest equivalent in English is &quot;some&quot;, although it is classified as a determiner, and English uses it less than French uses . 
: French: 
: &quot;Do you want (some) coffee?&quot;

:For more information, see the article on the French partitive article.

Haida has a partitive article (suffixed ) referring to &quot;part of something or... to one or more objects of a given group or category,&quot; e.g., &quot;he is making a boat (a member of the category of boats).&quot;

===Negative article===
A negative article specifies &quot;none&quot; of its noun, and can thus be regarded as neither definite nor indefinite. On the other hand, some consider such a word to be a simple determiner rather than an article. In English, this function is fulfilled by &quot;no&quot;, which can appear before a singular or plural noun: 
: &quot;No man has been on this island.&quot;
: &quot;No dogs are allowed here.&quot;
: &quot;No one is in the room.&quot;

In German, the negative article is, among other variations, &quot;kein&quot;, in opposition to the indefinite article &quot;ein&quot;.
:&quot;Ein Hund&quot; – a dog
:&quot;Kein Hund&quot; – no dog

The equivalent in Dutch is &quot;geen&quot;:
: &quot;een hond&quot; – a dog
: &quot;geen hond&quot; – no dog

===Zero article===

The zero article is the absence of an article. In languages having a definite article, the lack of an article specifically indicates that the noun is indefinite. Linguists interested in X-bar theory causally link zero articles to nouns lacking a determiner. In English, the zero article rather than the indefinite is used with plurals and mass nouns, although the word &quot;some&quot; can be used as an indefinite plural article.

: &quot;Visitors end up walking in mud.&quot;

==Crosslinguistic variation==

Articles are found in many Indo-European languages, Semitic languages, Polynesian languages, and even language isolates such as Basque; however, they are formally absent from many of the world&#x27;s major languages including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, Tibetan, many Turkic languages (including Tatar, Bashkir, Tuvan and Chuvash), many Uralic languages (incl. Finnic and Saami languages), Hindi-Urdu, Punjabi, the Dravidian languages (incl. Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada), the Baltic languages, the majority of Slavic languages, the Bantu languages (incl. Swahili). In some languages that do have articles, such as some North Caucasian languages, the use of articles is optional; however, in others like English and German it is mandatory in all cases.

Linguists believe the common ancestor of the Indo-European languages, Proto-Indo-European, did not have articles. Most of the languages in this family do not have definite or indefinite articles: there is no article in Latin or Sanskrit, nor in some modern Indo-European languages, such as the families of Slavic languages (except for Bulgarian and Macedonian, which are rather distinctive among the Slavic languages in their grammar, and some Northern Russian dialects), Baltic languages and many Indo-Aryan languages. Although Classical Greek had a definite article (which has survived into Modern Greek and which bears strong functional resemblance to the German definite article, which it is related to), the earlier Homeric Greek used this article largely as a pronoun or demonstrative, whereas the earliest known form of Greek known as Mycenaean Greek did not have any articles. Articles developed independently in several language families.

Not all languages have both definite and indefinite articles, and some languages have different types of definite and indefinite articles to distinguish finer shades of meaning: for example, French and Italian have a partitive article used for indefinite mass nouns, whereas Colognian has two distinct sets of definite articles indicating focus and uniqueness, and Macedonian uses definite articles in a demonstrative sense, with a tripartite distinction (proximal, medial, distal) based on distance from the speaker or interlocutor. The words &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot; (and their plurals, &quot;these&quot; and &quot;those&quot;) can be understood in English as, ultimately, forms of the definite article &quot;the&quot; (whose declension in Old English included &quot;thaes&quot;, an ancestral form of this/that and these/those).

In many languages, the form of the article may vary according to the gender, number, or case of its noun. In some languages the article may be the only indication of the case. Many languages do not use articles at all, and may use other ways of indicating old versus new information, such as topic–comment constructions.

===Tables===


The following examples show articles which are always suffixed to the noun:

* Albanian: &quot;zog&quot;, a bird; &quot;zogu&quot;, the bird
* Aramaic: שלם (shalam), peace; שלמא (shalma), the peace
** Note: Aramaic is written from right to left, so an Aleph is added to the end of the word. ם becomes מ when it is not the final letter. 
* Assamese: &quot;কিতাপ (kitap)&quot;, book; &quot;কিতাপখন (kitapkhôn)&quot;: &quot;The book&quot;
* Bengali: &quot;বই (bôi)&quot;, book; &quot;বইটি (bôiti)/বইটা (bôita)/বইখানা (bôikhana)&quot; : &quot;The Book&quot;
* Bulgarian: стол &quot;stol&quot;, chair; столът &quot;stolǎt&quot;, the chair (subject); стола &quot;stola&quot;, the chair (object)
* Danish: &quot;hus&quot;, house; &quot;huset, the house; if there is an adjective: det gamle hus&quot;, the old house
* Icelandic: &quot;hestur&quot;, horse; &quot;hesturinn&quot;, the horse
* Macedonian: стол &quot;stol&quot;, chair; столот &quot;stolot&quot;, the chair; столов &quot;stolov&quot;, this chair; столон &quot;stolon&quot;, that chair
* Persian: &quot;sib&quot;, apple. (There is no definite articles in the Standard Persian. It has one indefinite article &#x27;yek&#x27; that means &#x27;one&#x27;. In Standard Persian, if a noun is not indefinite, it is a definite noun. &#x27;Sib e&#x27; man&#x27; means &#x27;my apple&#x27;. Here, &#x27;e&#x27; is like &#x27;of&#x27; in English, so literally &#x27;sib e man&#x27; means &#x27;the apple of mine&#x27;. However, in Iranian Persian, &quot;-e&quot; is used as a definite article, quite different from Standard Persian. &quot;pesar&quot;, boy; &quot;pesare&quot;, the boy; &quot;pesare in&#x27;o be&#x27;m dād&quot;, the boy gave me this.)
* Romanian: &quot;drum&quot;, road; &quot;drum&quot;ul, the road (the article is just &quot;l&quot;, &quot;u&quot; is a &quot;connection vowel&quot; )
* Swedish and Norwegian: &quot;hus&quot;, house; &quot;huset, the house; if there is an adjective: det gamle (N)/gamla (S) huset&quot;, the old house

* , transcribed as &quot;yeled&quot;, a boy; , transcribed as , the boy
* , a book; , the book; , a donation; , the donation; , a key; , the key; , a house; , the house; , an ant; , the ant; , a head; , the head; , a bed; , the bed; , an apple; , the apple; , a month; , the month; , a carrot; , the carrot; , a time; , the time

A different way, limited to the definite article, is used by Latvian and Lithuanian. 
The noun does not change but the adjective can be defined or undefined. In Latvian: &quot;galds&quot;, a table / the table; &quot;balts galds&quot;, a white table; &quot;baltais galds&quot;, the white table. In Lithuanian: &quot;stalas&quot;, a table / the table; &quot;baltas stalas&quot;, a white table; &quot;baltasis stalas&quot;, the white table.

Languages in the above table written in &quot;italics&quot; are constructed languages and are not natural, that is to say that they have been purposefully invented by an individual (or group of individuals) with some purpose in mind.

=== Tokelauan ===

When using a definite article in Tokelauan language, unlike in some languages like English, if the speaker is speaking of an item, they need not have referred to it previously as long as the item is specific. This is also true when it comes to the reference of a specific person. So, although the definite article used to describe a noun in the Tokelauan language is &quot;te&quot;, it can also translate to the indefinite article in languages that requires the item being spoken of to have been referenced prior. When translating to English, &quot;te&quot; could translate to the English definite article &quot;the&quot;, or it could also translate to the English indefinite article &quot;a&quot;. An example of how the definite article &quot;te&quot; can be used as an interchangeable definite or indefinite article in the Tokelauan language would be the sentence “&quot;Kua hau te tino&quot;”. In the English language, this could be translated as “A man has arrived” or “The man has arrived” where using &quot;te&quot; as the article in this sentence can represent any man or a particular man. The word &quot;he&quot;, which is the indefinite article in Tokelauan, is used to describe ‘any such item’, and is encountered most often with negatives and interrogatives. An example of the use of &quot;he&quot; as an indefinite article is “&quot;Vili ake oi k&#x27;aumai he toki&quot; ”, where ‘&quot;he toki&quot; ’ mean ‘an axe’. The use of &quot;he&quot; and &quot;te&quot; in Tokelauan are reserved for when describing a singular noun. However, when describing a plural noun, different articles are used. For plural definite nouns, rather than &quot;te&quot;, the article &quot;nā&quot; is used. ‘&quot;Vili ake oi k&#x27;aumai nā nofoa&quot;’ in Tokelauan would translate to “Do run and bring me the chairs” in English. There are some special cases in which instead of using &quot;nā&quot;, plural definite nouns have no article before them. The absence of an article is represented by &quot;0&quot;. One way that it is usually used is if a large amount or a specific class of things are being described. Occasionally, such as if one was describing an entire class of things in a nonspecific fashion, the singular definite noun &quot;te&quot; would is used. In English, ‘&quot;Ko te povi e kai mutia&quot;’ means “Cows eat grass”. Because this is a general statement about cows, &quot;te&quot; is used instead of &quot;nā&quot;. The &quot;ko&quot; serves as a preposition to the “&quot;te&quot;” The article &quot;ni&quot; is used for describing a plural indefinite noun. ‘&quot;E i ei ni tuhi?&quot;’ translates to “Are there any books?”

==Historical development==

Articles often develop by specialization of adjectives or determiners. Their development is often a sign of languages becoming more analytic instead of synthetic, perhaps combined with the loss of inflection as in English, Romance languages, Bulgarian, Macedonian and Torlakian.

Joseph Greenberg in Universals of Human Language describes &quot;the cycle of the definite article&quot;: Definite articles (Stage I) evolve from demonstratives, and in turn can become generic articles (Stage II) that may be used in both definite and indefinite contexts, and later merely noun markers (Stage III) that are part of nouns other than proper names and more recent borrowings. Eventually articles may evolve anew from demonstratives.

=== Definite articles ===

Definite articles typically arise from demonstratives meaning &quot;that&quot;. For example, the definite articles in most Romance languages—e.g., &quot;el&quot;, &quot;il&quot;, &quot;le&quot;, &quot;la&quot;, &quot;lo, a, o&quot; — derive from the Latin demonstratives &quot;ille&quot; (masculine), &quot;illa&quot; (feminine) and &quot;illud&quot; (neuter).

The English definite article &quot;the&quot;, written &quot;þe&quot; in Middle English, derives from an Old English demonstrative, which, according to gender, was written &quot;se&quot; (masculine), &quot;seo&quot; (feminine) (&quot;þe&quot; and &quot;þeo&quot; in the Northumbrian dialect), or &quot;þæt&quot; (neuter). The neuter form &quot;þæt&quot; also gave rise to the modern demonstrative &quot;that&quot;. The &quot;ye&quot; occasionally seen in pseudo-archaic usage such as &quot;Ye Olde Englishe Tea Shoppe&quot; is actually a form of &quot;þe&quot;, where the letter thorn (&quot;þ&quot;) came to be written as a &quot;y&quot;.

Multiple demonstratives can give rise to multiple definite articles. Macedonian, for example, in which the articles are suffixed, has &quot;столот&quot; (&quot;stolot&quot;), the chair; &quot;столов&quot; (&quot;stolov&quot;), this chair; and &quot;столон&quot; (&quot;stolon&quot;), that chair. These derive from the Proto-Slavic demonstratives &quot;&quot; &quot;this, that&quot;, &quot;&quot; &quot;this here&quot; and &quot;&quot; &quot;that over there, yonder&quot; respectively. Colognian prepositions articles such as in &quot;dat Auto&quot;, or &quot;et Auto&quot;, the car; the first being specifically selected, focused, newly introduced, while the latter is not selected, unfocused, already known, general, or generic.

Standard Basque distinguishes between proximal and distal definite articles in the plural (dialectally, a proximal singular and an additional medial grade may also be present). The Basque distal form (with infix &quot;-a-&quot;, etymologically a suffixed and phonetically reduced form of the distal demonstrative &quot;har-/hai-&quot;) functions as the default definite article, whereas the proximal form (with infix &quot;-o-&quot;, derived from the proximal demonstrative &quot;hau-/hon-&quot;) is marked and indicates some kind of (spatial or otherwise) close relationship between the speaker and the referent (e.g., it may imply that the speaker is included in the referent): &quot;etxeak&quot; (&quot;the houses&quot;) vs. &quot;etxeok&quot; (&quot;these houses [of ours]&quot;), &quot;euskaldunak&quot; (&quot;the Basque speakers&quot;) vs. &quot;euskaldunok&quot; (&quot;we, the Basque speakers&quot;).

Speakers of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, a modern Aramaic language that lacks a definite article, may at times use demonstratives &quot;aha&quot; and &quot;aya&quot; (feminine) or &quot;awa&quot; (masculine) – which translate to &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot;, respectively – to give the sense of &quot;the&quot;. In Indonesian, the third person possessive suffix &quot;-nya&quot; could be also used as a definite article.

=== Indefinite articles ===

Indefinite articles typically arise from adjectives meaning &quot;one&quot;. For example, the indefinite articles in the Romance languages—e.g., &quot;un&quot;, &quot;una&quot;, &quot;une&quot;—derive from the Latin adjective &quot;unus&quot;. Partitive articles, however, derive from Vulgar Latin &quot;de illo&quot;, meaning &quot;(some) of the&quot;.

The English indefinite article &quot;an&quot; is derived from the same root as &quot;one&quot;. The &quot;-n&quot; came to be dropped before consonants, giving rise to the shortened form &quot;a&quot;. The existence of both forms has led to many cases of juncture loss, for example transforming the original &quot;a napron&quot; into the modern &quot;an apron&quot;.

The Persian indefinite article is &quot;yek&quot;, meaning one.

<text>Allan Pinkerton (August 21, 1819 – July 1, 1884) was a Scottish-American cooper, abolitionist, detective, and spy, best known for creating the Pinkerton National Detective Agency in the United States and his claim to have foiled a plot in 1861 to assassinate president-elect Abraham Lincoln. During the Civil War, he provided the Union Army – specifically General George B. McClellan of the Army of the Potomac – with military intelligence, including extremely inaccurate enemy troop strength numbers. After the war, his agents played a significant role as strikebreakers – in particular during the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 – a role that Pinkerton men would continue to play after the death of their founder.

==Early life==
Allan Pinkerton was born in the Gorbals, a working-class area of Glasgow, on August 21, 1819, the second surviving son of William Pinkerton, a retired policeman, and Isobel McQueen; he was baptized on August 25, 1819, which many sources incorrectly give as his birthdate. He left school at the age of 10 after his father&#x27;s death. Pinkerton read voraciously and was largely self-educated. A cooper by trade, he was active in the Scottish Chartist movement as a young man. He was not raised in a religious upbringing, and was a lifelong atheist.

Pinkerton emigrated to the United States in 1842. In 1843, he heard of Dundee Township, Illinois, fifty miles northwest of Chicago on the Fox River. He built a cabin and started a cooperage, sending for his wife in Chicago when their cabin was complete. As early as 1844, Pinkerton worked for the Chicago abolitionist leaders, and his Dundee home was a stop on the Underground Railroad.

==Detective==
Pinkerton first became interested in criminal detective work while wandering through the wooded groves around Dundee, looking for trees to make barrel staves, when he came across a band of counterfeiters, who may have been affiliated with the notorious Banditti of the Prairie. After observing their movements for some time he informed the local sheriff, who arrested them. This later led to Pinkerton being appointed, in 1849, as the first police detective in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois. In 1850, he partnered with Chicago attorney Edward Rucker in forming the North-Western Police Agency, which later became Pinkerton &amp; Co, and finally Pinkerton National Detective Agency, still in existence today as Pinkerton Consulting and Investigations, a subsidiary of Securitas AB. Pinkerton&#x27;s business insignia was a wide open eye with the caption &quot;We never sleep.&quot; As the US expanded in territory, rail transport increased. Pinkerton&#x27;s agency solved a series of train robberies during the 1850s, first bringing Pinkerton into contact with George B. McClellan, then Chief Engineer and Vice President of the Illinois Central Railroad, and Abraham Lincoln, a lawyer who sometimes represented the company.

In 1859, he attended the secret meetings held by John Brown and Frederick Douglass in Chicago along with abolitionists John Jones and Henry O. Wagoner. At those meetings, Jones, Wagoner, and Pinkerton helped purchase clothes and supplies for Brown. Jones&#x27; wife, Mary, guessed that the supplies included the suit Brown was hanged in after the failure of John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry in November 1859.

==American Civil War==
When the Civil War began, Pinkerton served as head of the Union Intelligence Service during the first two years, heading off an alleged assassination plot in Baltimore, Maryland while guarding Abraham Lincoln on his way to Washington, D.C., as well as providing estimates of Confederate troop numbers to General George B. McClellan when he commanded the Army of the Potomac. His agents often worked undercover as Confederate soldiers and sympathizers to gather military intelligence. Pinkerton himself served on several undercover missions as a Confederate soldier using the alias Major E.J. Allen. He worked across the Deep South in the summer of 1861, focusing on fortifications and Confederate plans. He was found out in Memphis and barely escaped with his life. This counterintelligence work done by Pinkerton and his agents is comparable to the work done by today&#x27;s U.S. Army Counterintelligence Special Agents in which Pinkerton&#x27;s agency is considered an early predecessor. He was succeeded as Intelligence Service chief by Lafayette Baker; the Intelligence Service was the predecessor of the U.S. Secret Service. His work led to the establishment of the Federal secret service.

Military historians have been strongly critical of the intelligence Pinkerton provided for the Union Army, which for the most part was undigested raw data. In the view of T. Harry Williams, Pinkerton&#x27;s work was &quot;the poorest intelligence service any general ever had.&quot; Pinkerton&#x27;s estimates of Rebel troop numbers, derived from his credulous interrogations of Confederate prisoners, deserters, refugees, escaped slaves (&quot;contrabands&quot;), and civilians unused to counting large bodies of men, badly exaggerated the size of those formations, sometimes almost doubling their actual strength. Pinkerton&#x27;s numbers caused McClellan to consistently believe that he was drastically outnumbered by the Confederate forces he faced. McClellan&#x27;s action in the face of what he believed were overwhelming odds were unduly cautious, causing him to avoid offensive actions almost completely in favor of siege warfare and taking a defensive posture. This led to his retreat in the Peninsula Campaign, his failure to crush Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia at the Battle of Antietam, and his unnecessary delay in carrying out his orders to pursue Lee&#x27;s army as they retreated from their invasion of Maryland back into Virginia. These actions were all based on McClellan&#x27;s firm trust of Pinkerton&#x27;s reports, although the problem was compounded by the intelligence-gathering ineptitude of Brigadier General Alfred Pleasonton, McClellan&#x27;s head cavalryman and his alternate source of enemy troop information when Pinkerton did not have agents in place.

On the other hand, Edwin C. Fishel in &quot;The Secret War for the Union&quot; and James Mackay in &quot;Allan Pinkerton: The First Private Eye&quot; argue that the troop strength figures which Pinkerton passed on to McClellan were relatively accurate, and that McClellan himself held primary responsibility for inflating those numbers to wildly unrealistic levels.

==After the war==
Following Pinkerton&#x27;s services for the Union Army, he continued his pursuit of train robbers, including the Reno Gang. He was hired by the railroad express companies to track outlaw Jesse James, but after Pinkerton failed to capture him, the railroad withdrew their financial support and Pinkerton continued to track James at his own expense. After James allegedly captured and killed one of Pinkerton&#x27;s undercover agents (who was working undercover at the farm neighboring the James family&#x27;s farmstead), he abandoned the chase. Some consider this failure Pinkerton&#x27;s biggest defeat. In 1872, the Spanish Government hired Pinkerton to help suppress a revolution in Cuba which intended to end slavery and give citizens the right to vote. If Pinkerton knew this, then it directly contradicts statements in his 1883 book &quot;The Spy of the Rebellion&quot;, where he professes to be an ardent abolitionist and hater of slavery. The Spanish government abolished slavery in 1880 and a Royal Decree abolished the last vestiges of it in 1886.

==Personal life==
Pinkerton married Joan Carfrae (1822–1887), a singer from Duddingston, in Glasgow on March 13, 1842. They remained married until his death. They had six children: Isabella, William, Joan, Robert, Mary, and Joan.

==Death==
Pinkerton died in Chicago on July 1, 1884. It is usually said that Pinkerton slipped on the pavement and bit his tongue, resulting in gangrene. Contemporary reports give conflicting causes, such as that he succumbed to a stroke – he had a year earlier – or to malaria, which he had contracted during a trip to the Southern United States. At the time of his death, he was working on a system to centralize all criminal identification records; such a database is now maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Pinkerton is buried between his wife and Kate Warne in the family plot in Graceland Cemetery, Chicago. He is a member of the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame.

==Legacy==
After his death, the agency continued to operate and soon became a major force against the labor movement developing in the US and Canada. This effort changed the image of the Pinkertons for years. They were involved in numerous activities against labor during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including:

* The Homestead Strike (1892), the direct impetus for the federal Anti-Pinkerton Act of 1893, prohibiting the federal government from hiring its detectives
* The Pullman Strike (1894)
* The Wild Bunch Gang (1896)
* The Ludlow Massacre (1914)
* The La Follette Committee (1933–1937)

Despite his agency&#x27;s later reputation for anti-labor activities, Pinkerton himself was heavily involved in pro-labor politics as a young man. Though Pinkerton considered himself pro-labor, he opposed strikes and distrusted labor unions.

Allan Pinkerton was so famous that for decades after his death, his surname was a slang term for a private eye, whether they were agents of the Pinkerton Agency or not. The &quot;Mr. Pinkerton&quot; novels, by American mystery writer Zenith Jones Brown (under the pseudonym David Frome), were about Welsh-born amateur detective Evan Pinkerton and may have been inspired by the slang term.

==Writings==
Pinkerton produced numerous popular detective books, ostensibly based on his own exploits and those of his agents. Some were published after his death, and they are considered to have been more motivated by a desire to promote his detective agency than a literary endeavour. Most historians believe that Allan Pinkerton hired ghostwriters, but the books nonetheless bear his name and no doubt reflect his views.

<text>Thomas Graham (20 December 1805 – 11 September 1869) was a Scottish chemist known for his pioneering work in dialysis and the diffusion of gases. He is regarded as one of the founders of colloid chemistry.

==Life==
Graham was born in Glasgow, Scotland and was educated at the High School of Glasgow. Graham&#x27;s father was a successful textile manufacturer, and wanted his son to enter into the Church of Scotland. Instead, defying his father&#x27;s wishes, Graham became a student at the University of Glasgow in 1819. There he developed a strong interest in chemistry, studying under Professor Thomas Thomson, who was impressed and influenced by the young man. He left the university after receiving his MA in 1824.

He later studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and then briefly taught chemistry at the Glasgow University Portland Street Medical School. In 1828 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposer was Edward Turner. He won the Society&#x27;s Keith Medal for the period 1831–33.

in 1830 he was appointed to be the first professor of chemistry at the Anderson&#x27;s Medical School, a post later named the Freeland Chair of Chemistry. He also delivered lectures to the Glasgow Mechanics&#x27; Institution before moving to take up a professorship at the University of London, where Graham founded the Chemical Society of London in 1841. In 1866, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

His final position was the Master of the Mint, where he stayed from 1855 until his death. He was the last person to hold that position: afterwards the post was amalgamated into the Chancellor of the Exchequer while all the actual responsibilities were transferred to the Deputy Master.

He died in Gordon Square in London but his body was returned to Glasgow for burial in the family plot at Glasgow Cathedral.

*&quot;On the Law of Diffusion of Gases&quot; (1833)

==Scientific works==
Thomas Graham is known for his studies on the behavior of gases, which resulted in his formulation of two relationships, both since becoming known as &quot;Graham&#x27;s laws,&quot; the first regarding gas diffusion, and the second regarding gas effusion. In the former case, Graham deduced that when measured repeatedly under the same conditions of pressure and temperature, the rate of diffusive mixing of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its density, and given the relationship between density and molar mass, also inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass. In the same way, in the latter case, regarding effusion of a gas through a pin hole in to a vacuum, Graham deduced that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass. These two are sometimes referred to as a combined law (describing both phenomena).

In applied areas, Graham also made fundamental discoveries related to dialysis, a process used in research and industrial settings, as well as in modern health care. Graham&#x27;s study of colloids resulted in his ability to separate colloids and crystalloids using a so-called &quot;dialyzer&quot;, using technology that is a rudimentary forerunner of technology in modern kidney dialysis machines. These studies were foundational in the field known as colloid chemistry, and Graham is credited as one of its founders.

He also proposed the association theory which claimed that the substances such as cellulose or starch that we now know are polymers are composed from smaller molecules hold together by unknown forces. It remained the most popular explanation until Hermann Staudinger&#x27;s macromolecular theory of 1920s.

<text>The laws describing the behaviour of gases under fixed pressure, volume, amount of gas, and absolute temperature conditions are called gas laws. The basic gas laws were discovered by the end of the 18th century when scientists found out that relationships between pressure, volume and temperature of a sample of gas could be obtained which would hold to approximation for all gases. The combination of several empirical gas laws led to the development of the ideal gas law.

The ideal gas law was later found to be consistent with atomic and kinetic theory.

== History ==
In 1643, the Italian physicist and mathematician, Evangelista Torricelli, who for a few months had acted as Galileo Galileo&#x27;s secretary, conducted a celebrated experiment in Florence. He demonstrated that a column of mercury in an inverted tube can be supported by the pressure of air outside of the tube, with the creation of a small section of vacuum above the mercury. This experiment essentially paved the way towards the invention of the barometer, as well as drawing the attention of Robert Boyle, then a &quot;skeptical&quot; scientist working in England. Boyle was inspired by Torricelli&#x27;s experiment to investigate how the elasticity of air responds to varying pressure, and he did this through a series of experiments with a setup reminiscent of that used by Torricelli. Boyle published his results in 1662. 

Later on, in 1676, the French physicist Edme Mariotte, independently arrived at the same conclusions of Boyle, while also noting some dependency of air volume on temperature. However it took another century and a half for the development of thermometry and recognition of the absolute zero temperature scale, which eventually allowed the discovery of temperature-dependent gas laws.

==Boyle&#x27;s law==

In 1662, Robert Boyle systematically studied the relationship between the volume and pressure of a fixed amount of gas at a constant temperature. He observed that the volume of a given mass of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure at a constant temperature.
Boyle&#x27;s law, published in 1662, states that, at a constant temperature, the product of the pressure and volume of a given mass of an ideal gas in a closed system is always constant. It can be verified experimentally using a pressure gauge and a variable volume container. It can also be derived from the kinetic theory of gases: if a container, with a fixed number of molecules inside, is reduced in volume, more molecules will strike a given area of the sides of the container per unit time, causing a greater pressure.

=== Statement ===
Boyle&#x27;s law states that:

The concept can be represented with these formulae:
*formula_1, meaning &quot;Volume is inversely proportional to Pressure&quot;, or
*formula_2, meaning &quot;Pressure is inversely proportional to Volume&quot;, or
*formula_3, or
formula_4
where is the pressure, is the volume of a gas, and is the constant in this equation (and is not the same as the proportionality constants in the other equations).

==Charles&#x27; law==

Charles&#x27; law, or the law of volumes, was founded in 1787 by Jacques Charles. It states that, for a given mass of an ideal gas at constant pressure, the volume is directly proportional to its absolute temperature, assuming in a closed system.
The statement of Charles&#x27; law is as follows:
the volume (V) of a given mass of a gas, at constant pressure (P), is directly proportional to its temperature (T).

=== Statement ===
Charles&#x27; law states that:

Therefore,

* formula_5, or
* formula_6, or
:formula_7,
where &quot;V&quot; is the volume of a gas, &quot;T&quot; is the absolute temperature and &quot;k&quot;2 is a proportionality constant (which is not the same as the proportionality constants in the other equations in this article).

==Gay-Lussac&#x27;s law==

Gay-Lussac&#x27;s law, Amontons&#x27; law or the pressure law was founded by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac in 1808.

=== Statement ===
Gay-Lussac&#x27;s law states that:

Therefore,

* formula_8, or
* formula_9, or

formula_10,

:where &quot;P&quot; is the pressure, &quot;T&quot; is the absolute temperature, and &quot;k&quot; is another proportionality constant.

==Avogadro&#x27;s law==
Avogadro&#x27;s law, Avogadro&#x27;s hypothesis, Avogadro&#x27;s principle or Avogadro-Ampère&#x27;s hypothesis is an experimental gas law which was hypothesized by Amedeo Avogadro in 1811. It related the volume of a gas to the amount of substance of gas present.

=== Statement ===
Avogadro&#x27;s law states that:

This statement gives rise to the molar volume of a gas, which at STP (273.15 K, 1 atm) is about 22.4 L. The relation is given by:

:formula_11, orformula_12where &quot;n&quot; is equal to the number of molecules of gas (or the number of moles of gas).

==Combined and ideal gas laws==
The combined gas law or general gas equation is obtained by combining Boyle&#x27;s law, Charles&#x27;s law, and Gay-Lussac&#x27;s law. It shows the relationship between the pressure, volume, and temperature for a fixed mass of gas:

:formula_13

This can also be written as:

:formula_14

With the addition of Avogadro&#x27;s law, the combined gas law develops into the ideal gas law:

:formula_15
:where &quot;P&quot; is the pressure, &quot;V&quot; is volume, &quot;n&quot; is the number of moles, &quot;R&quot; is the universal gas constant and &quot;T&quot; is the absolute temperature.
:The proportionality constant, now named R, is the universal gas constant with a value of 8.3144598 (kPa∙L)/(mol∙K).
An equivalent formulation of this law is:
:formula_16
:where &quot;P&quot; is the pressure, &quot;V&quot; is the volume, &quot;N&quot; is the number of gas molecules, &quot;k&quot;B is the Boltzmann constant (1.381×10−23J·K−1 in SI units) and T is the absolute temperature.

These equations are exact only for an ideal gas, which neglects various intermolecular effects (see real gas). However, the ideal gas law is a good approximation for most gases under moderate pressure and temperature.

This law has the following important consequences:
# If temperature and pressure are kept constant, then the volume of the gas is directly proportional to the number of molecules of gas.
# If the temperature and volume remain constant, then the pressure of the gas changes is directly proportional to the number of molecules of gas present.
# If the number of gas molecules and the temperature remain constant, then the pressure is inversely proportional to the volume.
# If the temperature changes and the number of gas molecules are kept constant, then either pressure or volume (or both) will change in direct proportion to the temperature.

==Other gas laws==
;Graham&#x27;s law: This law states that the rate at which gas molecules diffuse is inversely proportional to the square root of the gas density at a constant temperature. Combined with Avogadro&#x27;s law (i.e. since equal volumes have an equal number of molecules) this is the same as being inversely proportional to the root of the molecular weight.
;Dalton&#x27;s law of partial pressures: This law states that the pressure of a mixture of gases simply is the sum of the partial pressures of the individual components. Dalton&#x27;s law is as follows:
:formula_17
:and all component gases and the mixture are at the same temperature and volume
:where &quot;P&quot;total is the total pressure of the gas mixture
:&quot;P&quot;i is the partial pressure or pressure of the component gas at the given volume and temperature.
;Amagat&#x27;s law of partial volumes: This law states that the volume of a mixture of gases (or the volume of the container) simply is the sum of the partial volumes of the individual components. Amagat&#x27;s law is as follows:
:formula_18
:and all component gases and the mixture are at the same temperature and pressure
:where &quot;V&quot;total is the total volume of the gas mixture or the volume of the container,
:&quot;V&quot;i is the partial volume, or volume of the component gas at the given pressure and temperature.
;Henry&#x27;s law: This states that at constant temperature, the amount of a given gas dissolved in a given type and volume of liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas in equilibrium with that liquid. The equation is as follows:
:formula_19
;Real gas law: This was formulated by Johannes Diderik van der Waals in 1873.

<doc id="48211" wikidata="Q1426478" url="?curid=48211" title="Golomb ruler">
<text>In mathematics, a Golomb ruler is a set of marks at integer positions along a ruler such that no two pairs of marks are the same distance apart. The number of marks on the ruler is its &quot;order&quot;, and the largest distance between two of its marks is its &quot;length&quot;. Translation and reflection of a Golomb ruler are considered trivial, so the smallest mark is customarily put at 0 and the next mark at the smaller of its two possible values. Golomb rulers can be viewed as a one-dimensional special case of Costas arrays.

The Golomb ruler was named for Solomon W. Golomb and discovered independently by and . Sophie Piccard also published early research on these sets, in 1939, stating as a theorem the claim that two Golomb rulers with the same distance set must be congruent. This turned out to be false for six-point rulers, but true otherwise.

There is no requirement that a Golomb ruler be able to measure &quot;all&quot; distances up to its length, but if it does, it is called a &quot;perfect&quot; Golomb ruler. It has been proved that no perfect Golomb ruler exists for five or more marks. A Golomb ruler is &quot;optimal&quot; if no shorter Golomb ruler of the same order exists. Creating Golomb rulers is easy, but proving the optimal Golomb ruler (or rulers) for a specified order is computationally very challenging.

Distributed.net has completed distributed massively parallel searches for optimal order-24 through order-28 Golomb rulers, each time confirming the suspected candidate ruler.

Currently, the complexity of finding optimal Golomb rulers (OGRs) of arbitrary order &quot;n&quot; (where &quot;n&quot; is given in unary) is unknown. In the past there was some speculation that it is an NP-hard problem. Problems related to the construction of Golomb rulers are provably shown to be NP-hard, where it is also noted that no known NP-complete problem has similar flavor to finding Golomb rulers.

==Definitions==

===Golomb rulers as sets===
A set of integers formula_1 where formula_2 is a Golomb ruler if and only if

:formula_3

The &quot;order&quot; of such a Golomb ruler is formula_4 and its &quot;length&quot; is formula_5. The canonical form has formula_6 and, if formula_7, formula_8. Such a form can be achieved through translation and reflection.

===Golomb rulers as functions===
An injective function formula_9 with formula_10 and formula_11 is a Golomb ruler if and only if

:formula_12

The &quot;order&quot; of such a Golomb ruler is formula_4 and its &quot;length&quot; is formula_14. The canonical form has
:formula_15 if formula_7.

===Optimality===
A Golomb ruler of order m with length n may be optimal in either of two respects:

* It may be &quot;optimally dense&quot;, exhibiting maximal m for the specific value of n,
* It may be &quot;optimally short&quot;, exhibiting minimal n for the specific value of m.

The general term &quot;optimal Golomb ruler&quot; is used to refer to the second type of optimality.

==Practical applications==
===Information theory and error correction===
Golomb rulers are used within information theory related to error correcting codes.

===Radio frequency selection===
Golomb rulers are used in the selection of radio frequencies to reduce the effects of intermodulation interference with both terrestrial and extraterrestrial applications.

===Radio antenna placement===
Golomb rulers are used in the design of phased arrays of radio antennas. In radio astronomy one-dimensional synthesis arrays can have the antennas in a Golomb ruler configuration in order to obtain minimum redundancy of the Fourier component sampling.

===Current transformers===
Multi-ratio current transformers use Golomb rulers to place transformer tap points.

==Methods of construction==
A number of construction methods produce asymptotically optimal Golomb rulers.

===Erdős–Turán construction===
The following construction, due to Paul Erdős and Pál Turán, produces a Golomb ruler for every odd prime p.

:formula_17

==Known optimal Golomb rulers==
The following table contains all known optimal Golomb rulers, excluding those with marks in the reverse order. The first four are perfect.

<doc id="48212" wikidata="Q13233" url="?curid=48212" title="Ice cream">
<text>Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that has been flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. It can also be made by whisking a flavoured cream base and liquid nitrogen together. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below ). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.

Ice cream may be served in dishes, eaten with a spoon, or licked from edible wafer ice cream cones held by the hands as finger food. Ice cream may be served with other desserts—such as cake or pie—or used as an ingredient in cold dishes—like ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, and ice cream cakes—or in baked items such as Baked Alaska.

Italian ice cream is gelato. Frozen custard is a type of rich ice cream. Soft serve is softer and is often served at amusement parks and fast-food restaurants in the United States. Ice creams made from cow&#x27;s milk alternatives, such as goat&#x27;s or sheep&#x27;s milk, or milk substitutes (e.g., soy, oat, cashew, coconut, almond milk, or tofu), are available for those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan. Banana &quot;nice cream&quot; is a 100% fruit-based vegan alternative. Frozen yoghurt, or &quot;froyo&quot;, is similar to ice cream but uses yoghurt and can be lower in fat. Fruity sorbets or sherbets are not ice creams but are often available in ice cream shops.

The meaning of the name &quot;ice cream&quot; varies from one country to another. In some countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, &quot;ice cream&quot; applies only to a specific variety, and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients, notably the amount of cream. Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are sometimes labelled &quot;frozen dairy dessert&quot; instead. In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina, one word is used for all variants.

== History ==
===Early frozen desserts===
The origins of frozen desserts are obscure, although several accounts exist about their history. Some sources say the history of ice cream begins in Persia in 550 BC. 
A Roman cookbook dating back to the 1st century includes recipes for sweet desserts that are sprinkled with snow, and there are Persian records from the 2nd century for sweetened drinks chilled with ice.

 is a Japanese dessert made with ice and flavoured syrup. The origins of date back to the Heian period in Japanese history, when blocks of ice saved during the colder months would be shaved and served with sweet syrup to the Japanese aristocracy during the summer. &#x27;s origin is referred to in &quot;The Pillow Book&quot;, a book of observations written by Sei Shōnagon, who served the Imperial Court during the Heian period.

The earliest known written process to artificially make ice is known not from culinary texts, but the 13th-century writings of Syrian historian Ibn Abu Usaybia in his book “Kitab Uyun al-anba fi tabaqat-al-atibba“ (Book of Sources of Information on the Classes of Physicians) concerning medicine in which Ibn Abu Usaybi’a attributes the process to an even older author, Ibn Bakhtawayhi, of whom nothing is known.

Ice cream production became easier with the discovery of the endothermic effect. Prior to this, cream could be chilled easily but not frozen. The addition of salt lowered the melting point of ice, drawing heat from the cream and allowing it to freeze.

===Early modern===

In the 16th century, the Mughal Empire used relays of horsemen to bring ice from the Hindu Kush to its capital, Delhi, used to create kulfi, a popular frozen dairy dessert from the Indian subcontinent often described as traditional Indian ice cream.

=== Europe ===
The technique of freezing was not known from any European sources prior to the 16th century. During the 16th century, authors made reference to the refrigerant effect that happened when salt was added to ice. By the latter part of the 17th century sorbets and ice creams were made using this process.

Ice cream&#x27;s spread throughout Europe is sometimes attributed to Moorish traders, but more often Marco Polo. Though it is not mentioned in any of his writings, Polo is often credited with introducing sorbet-style desserts to Italy after learning of them during his travels to China. According to a legend, the Italian duchess Catherine de&#x27; Medici introduced flavoured sorbet ices to France when she brought Italian chefs with her to France upon marrying the Duke of Orléans (Henry II of France) in 1533. No Italian chefs were present in France during the Medici period, and ice cream already existed in France before de Medici was born. One hundred years later, Charles I of England was reportedly so impressed by the &quot;frozen snow&quot; that he offered his own ice cream maker a lifetime pension in return for keeping the formula secret, so that ice cream could be a royal prerogative. There is no evidence to support these legends.

==== France ====
In 1665, the , edited in Montpellier by Jean Fargeon, listed a type of frozen sorbet. While the composition of this sorbet is not provided, Fargeon specified that it was consumed frozen using a container that was plunged into a mixture of ice and saltpetre. These sorbets were transported in pots made of clay and sold for three livres per pound.

According to , the practice of cooling drinks with ice and snow had already emerged in Paris, particularly in the court, during the 16th century. The narrator notes that his hosts stored ice and snow, which they later added to their wine. This practice slowly progressed during the reign of Louis XIII and was likely a necessary step towards the creation of ice cream. In 1682, provided a recipe for a specific type of ice cream, called .

In 1686, Italian Francesco dei Coltelli opened an ice cream café in Paris, and the product became so popular that during the next 50 years, another 250 cafés opened in Paris.

The first recipe in French for flavoured ices appears in 1674, in Nicholas Lemery&#x27;s . Recipes for saw publication in the 1694 edition of Antonio Latini&#x27;s (The Modern Steward). Recipes for flavoured ices begin to appear in François Massialot&#x27;s , starting with the 1692 edition. Massialot&#x27;s recipes result in a coarse, pebbly texture. Latini claims that the results of his recipes should have the fine consistency of sugar and snow.

==== England ====
The first recorded mention of ice cream in England was in 1671. Elias Ashmole described the dishes served at the Feast of St George at Windsor for Charles II in 1671 and included &quot;one plate of ice cream&quot;. The only table at the banquet with ice cream on it was that of the King. The first recipe for ice cream in English was published in &quot;Mrs. Mary Eales&#x27;s Receipts,&quot; a book dedicated to confectionary, in London in 1718:


The 1751 edition of &quot;The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy&quot; by Hannah Glasse includes a recipe for ice cream: &quot;H. GLASSE Art of Cookery (ed. 4) 333 (heading) To make Ice Cream...set it [the cream] into the larger Bason. Fill it with Ice, and a Handful of Salt.&quot; by M. Emy, in 1768, was a cookbook devoted to recipes for flavoured ices and ice cream.

In 1769 Domenico Negri, an Italian confectioner, founded a business in Berkeley Square London which would become famous for its ice creams. His shop was at the Sign of the Pineapple (an emblem used by confectioners) and his trade card said he sold &quot;All Sorts of English, French and Italian wet and dry&#x27;d Sweet Meats, Cedrati and Bergamot Chips, Naples Diavoloni, All sorts of Baskets &amp; Cakes, fine and Common Sugar plums&quot;, but most importantly, &quot;all Sorts of Ice, Fruits and creams in the best Italian manner.&quot;

In 1789 Frederick Nutt, who served an apprenticeship at Negri&#x27;s establishment, first published &quot;The Complete Confectioner&quot;. The book had 31 recipes for ice creams, some with fresh fruit, others with jams, and some using fruit syrups. Flavours included ginger, chocolate, brown breadcrumbs and one flavoured with Parmesan cheese.

=== North America ===
An early North American reference to ice cream is from 1744: &quot;Among the rarities[...] was some fine ice cream, which, with the strawberries and milk, eat most deliciously.&quot; It was served by the lady of Governor Bland.

Who brought ice cream to the United States first is unknown. Confectioners sold ice cream at their shops in New York and other cities during the colonial era. Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson were known to have regularly eaten and served ice cream. Records, kept by a merchant from Chatham street, New York, show George Washington spending approximately $200 on ice cream in the summer of 1790. The same records show president Thomas Jefferson having an 18-step recipe for ice cream. Although it is incorrect that Jefferson introduced ice cream to America, as is popularly believed, he did help to introduce vanilla ice cream. First Lady Dolley Madison, wife of U.S. President James Madison, served ice cream at her husband&#x27;s Inaugural Ball in 1813.

Small-scale hand-cranked ice cream freezers were invented in England by Agnes Marshall and in America by Nancy Johnson in the 1840s.

=== Expansion in popularity ===


In the Mediterranean, ice cream appears to have been accessible to ordinary people by the mid-18th century. Ice cream became popular and inexpensive in England in the mid-19th century, when Swiss émigré Carlo Gatti set up the first stand outside Charing Cross station in 1851. He sold scoops in shells for one penny. Prior to this, ice cream was an expensive treat confined to those with access to an ice house. Gatti built an &#x27;ice well&#x27; to store ice that he cut from Regent&#x27;s Canal under a contract with the Regent&#x27;s Canal Company. By 1860, he expanded the business and began importing ice on a large scale from Norway.

In New Zealand, a newspaper advertisement for ice cream appeared in 1866, claiming to be the first time ice cream was available in Wellington. Commercial manufacturing was underway in 1875. Ice cream rapidly gained in popularity in New Zealand throughout the 20th century. By 2018, exported ice cream products included new flavours such as matcha to cater to Asian markets.

Agnes Marshall, regarded as the &quot;queen of ices&quot; in England, did much to popularize ice cream recipes and make its consumption into a fashionable middle-class pursuit. She wrote four books: &quot;The Book of Ices&quot; (1885), &quot;Mrs. A.B. Marshall&#x27;s Book of Cookery&quot; (1888), &quot;Mrs. A.B. Marshall&#x27;s Larger Cookery Book of Extra Recipes&quot; (1891) and &quot;Fancy Ices&quot; (1894) and gave public lectures on cooking. She even suggested using liquid nitrogen to make ice cream.

Ice cream soda was invented in the 1870s, adding to ice cream&#x27;s popularity. The invention of this cold treat is attributed to American Robert Green in 1874, although there is no conclusive evidence to prove his claim. The ice cream sundae originated in the late 19th century. Some sources say that the sundae was invented to circumvent blue laws, which forbade serving sodas on Sunday. Towns claiming to be the birthplace of the sundae include Buffalo, Two Rivers, Ithaca, and Evanston. Both the ice cream cone and banana split became popular in the early 20th century.

The first mention of the cone being used as an edible receptacle for the ice cream is in &quot;Mrs. A.B. Marshall&#x27;s Book of Cookery&quot; of 1888. Her recipe for &quot;Cornet with Cream&quot; said that &quot;the cornets were made with almonds and baked in the oven, not pressed between irons&quot;. The ice cream cone was popularized in the US at the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair in St. Louis, Missouri.

The history of ice cream in the 20th century is one of great change and increases in availability and popularity. In the United States in the early 20th century, the ice cream soda was a popular treat at the soda shop, the soda fountain, and the ice cream parlour. During the American Prohibition, the soda fountain to some extent replaced the outlawed alcohol establishments such as bars and saloons.

Ice cream became popular throughout the world in the second half of the 20th century after cheap refrigeration became common. There was an explosion of ice cream stores and of flavours and types. Vendors often competed on the basis of variety: Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants advertised &quot;a world of 28 flavors&quot;, and Baskin-Robbins made its 31 flavours (&quot;one for every day of the month&quot;) the cornerstone of its marketing strategy (the company now boasts that it has developed over 1,000 varieties).

One important development in the 20th century was the introduction of soft ice cream, which has more air mixed in, thereby reducing costs. The soft ice cream machine fills a cone or dish from a spigot. In the United States, chains such as Dairy Queen, Carvel, and Tastee-Freez helped popularize soft-serve ice cream. Baskin-Robbins later incorporated it into their menu.

Technological innovations such as these have introduced various food additives into ice cream, most notably the stabilizing agent gluten, to which some people have an intolerance. Recent awareness of this issue has prompted a number of manufacturers to start producing gluten-free ice cream.

The 1980s saw thicker ice creams being sold as &quot;premium&quot; and &quot;super-premium&quot; varieties under brands such as Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s, Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream Company and Häagen-Dazs.

== Composition ==
Ice cream is a colloidal emulsion made with water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air. Water and fat have the highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion that has dispersed phase as fat globules. The emulsion is turned into foam by incorporating air cells which are frozen to form dispersed ice cells. The triacylglycerols in fat are nonpolar and will adhere to themselves by Van der Waals interactions. Water is polar, thus emulsifiers are needed for dispersion of fat. Also, ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in its light texture. Milk proteins such as casein and whey protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can adsorb water and form micelles which will contribute to its consistency. The proteins contribute to the emulsification, aeration and texture. Sucrose, which is a disaccharide, is usually used as a sweetening agent. Lactose, which is sugar present in milk, will cause freezing point depression. Thus, on freezing some water will remain unfrozen and will not give a hard texture. Too much lactose will result in a non-ideal texture because of either excessive freezing point depression or lactose crystallization.

== Production ==

Before the development of modern refrigeration, ice cream was a luxury reserved for special occasions. Making it was quite laborious; ice was cut from lakes and ponds during the winter and stored in holes in the ground, or in wood-frame or brick ice houses, insulated by straw. Many farmers and plantation owners, including US Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, cut and stored ice in the winter for use in the summer. Frederic Tudor of Boston turned ice harvesting and shipping into a business, cutting ice in New England and shipping it around the world.

Ice cream was made by hand in a large bowl placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt. This is called the pot-freezer method. French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a (a covered pail with a handle attached to the lid). In the pot-freezer method, the temperature of the ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing latent heat and bringing the mixture below the freezing point of pure water.

The hand-cranked churn, which also uses ice and salt for cooling, replaced the pot-freezer method. The exact origin of the hand-cranked freezer is unknown, but the first US patent for one was #3254 issued to Nancy Johnson on 9 September 1843. The hand-cranked churn produced smoother ice cream than the pot freezer and did it quicker. Many inventors patented improvements on Johnson&#x27;s design.

In Europe and America, ice cream was made and sold by small businesses, mostly confectioners and caterers. Jacob Fussell of Baltimore, Maryland was the first to manufacture ice cream on a large scale. Fussell bought fresh dairy products from farmers in York County, Pennsylvania, and sold them in Baltimore. An unstable demand for his dairy products often left him with a surplus of cream, which he made into ice cream. He built his first ice cream factory in Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania, in 1851. Two years later, he moved his factory to Baltimore. Later, he opened factories in several other cities and taught the business to others, who operated their own plants. Mass production reduced the cost of ice cream and added to its popularity.

The development of industrial refrigeration by German engineer Carl von Linde during the 1870s eliminated the need to cut and store natural ice, and, when the freezer was perfected in 1926, commercial mass production of ice cream and the birth of the modern ice cream industry was underway.

In modern times, a common method for producing ice cream at home is to use an ice cream maker, an electrical device that churns the ice cream mixture while cooled inside a household freezer. Some more expensive models have an built-in freezing element. A newer method is to add liquid nitrogen to the mixture while stirring it using a spoon or spatula for a few seconds; a similar technique, advocated by Heston Blumenthal as ideal for home cooks, is to add dry ice to the mixture while stirring for a few minutes.

An unusual method of making ice cream was done during World War II by American fighter pilots based in the South Pacific. They attached pairs of cans to their aircraft. The cans were fitted with a small propeller, this was spun by the slipstream and drove a stirrer, which agitated the mixture while the intense cold of high altitude froze it. B-17 crews in Europe did something similar on their bombing runs as did others.

== Retail sales ==

Ice cream can be mass-produced and thus is widely available in developed parts of the world. Ice cream can be purchased in large cartons (vats and squrounds) from supermarkets and grocery stores, in smaller quantities from ice cream shops, convenience stores, and milk bars, and in individual servings from small carts or vans at public events. In 2015, the US produced nearly of ice cream.

=== Specialty job ===

Today, jobs specialize in the selling of ice cream. The title of a person who works in this speciality is often called an &#x27;ice cream man&#x27;, however women also specialize in the selling of ice cream. People in this line of work often sell ice cream on beaches. On beaches, ice cream is either sold by a person who carries a box full of ice cream and is called over by people who want to purchase ice cream, or by a person who drives up to the top of the beach and rings a bell. In the second method, people go up to the top of the beach and purchase ice cream straight from the ice cream seller, who is often in an ice cream van. In Turkey and Australia, ice cream is sometimes sold to beach-goers from small powerboats equipped with chest freezers.

Some ice cream distributors sell ice cream products from travelling refrigerated vans or carts (commonly referred to in the US as &quot;ice cream trucks&quot;), sometimes equipped with speakers playing children&#x27;s music or folk melodies (such as &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot;). The driver of an ice cream van drives throughout neighbourhoods and stops every so often, usually every block. The seller on the ice cream van sells the ice cream through a large window; this window is also where the customer asks for ice cream and pays. Ice cream vans in the United Kingdom make a music box noise rather than actual music.

== Ingredients and definitions ==
Many countries have regulations controlling what can be described as ice cream.

In the United Kingdom, Food Labelling Regulations (1996) set a requirement of at least 5% milk fat and 2.5% milk protein in order to be sold as ice cream within the UK. In rest of the European Union, a trade organization called European Ice Cream Association calls for minimum dairy fat content of 5%. In 2015, these regulations were relaxed so that containing milk fat or protein was no longer necessary in the UK for a product to be sold as &quot;ice cream&quot;, though at least 5% milk fat is still required for a product to be labeled &quot;dairy ice cream&quot;. After this change, many UK products labelled as &quot;ice cream&quot; substitute milk fat with cheaper alternatives like palm oil, coconut oil, and vegetable fats. 

In the US, the FDA rules state that to be described as &quot;ice cream&quot;, a product must have the following composition:

* greater than 10% milk fat
* 6 to 10% milk and non-fat milk solids: this component, also known as the milk solids-not-fat or serum solids, contains the proteins (caseins and whey proteins) and carbohydrates (lactose) found in milk

It generally also has:

* 12 to 16% sweeteners: usually a combination of sucrose and glucose-based corn syrup sweeteners
* 0.2 to 0.5% stabilizers and emulsifiers
* 55 to 64% water, which comes from the milk or other ingredients

These compositions are percentage by weight. Since ice cream can contain as much as half air by volume, these numbers may be reduced by as much as half if cited by volume. In terms of dietary considerations, the percentages by weight are more relevant. Even low-fat products have high caloric content: Ben and Jerry&#x27;s No-Fat Vanilla Fudge, for instance, contains per half-cup due to its high sugar content.

According to the Canadian Food and Drugs Act and Regulations, ice cream in Canada is divided into &quot;ice cream mix&quot; and &quot;ice cream&quot;. Each has a different set of regulations.

* &quot;Ice cream&quot; must be at least 10 percent milk fat, and must contain at least of solids per litre. When cocoa, chocolate syrup, fruit, nuts, or confections are added, the percentage of milk fat can be 8 percent.
* &quot;Ice cream mix&quot; is defined as the pasteurized mix of cream, milk and other milk products that are not yet frozen. It may contain eggs, artificial or non-artificial flavours, cocoa or chocolate syrup, a food colour, an agent that adjusts the pH level in the mix, salt, a stabilizing agent that does not exceed 0.5% of the ice cream mix, a sequestering agent which preserves the food colour, edible casein that does not exceed 1% of the mix, propylene glycol mono fatty acids in an amount that will not exceed 0.35% of the ice cream mix, and sorbitan tristearate in an amount that will not exceed 0.035% of the mix. Ice cream mix may not include less than 36% solid components.

== Physical properties ==
Ice cream is considered a colloidal system. It is composed by ice cream crystals and aggregates, air that does not mix with the ice cream by forming small bubbles in the bulk and partially coalesced fat globules. This dispersed phase made from all the small particles is surrounded by an unfrozen continuous phase composed by sugars, proteins, salts, polysaccharides and water. Their interactions determine the properties of ice cream, whether soft and whippy or hard.

=== Ostwald ripening ===
Ostwald ripening is the explanation for the growth of large crystals at the expense of small ones in the dispersion phase. This process is also called migratory recrystallization. It involves the formation of sharp crystals. Theories about Ostwald recrystallization admit that after a period of time, the recrystallization process can be described by the following equation:

formula_1

Where r (0) is the initial size, n the order of recrystallization, and t a time constant for recrystallization that depends on the rate R (in units of size/time).

To make ice cream smooth, recrystallization must occur as slowly as possible, because small crystals create smoothness, meaning that r must decrease.

== Food safety concerns ==
From the perspective of food chemistry, ice cream is a colloid or foam. The dietary emulsifier plays an important role in ice cream. Soy lecithin and polysorbate are two popular emulsifiers used for ice cream production. A mouse study in 2015 shows that two commonly used dietary emulsifiers carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and polysorbate 80 (P80) can potentially cause inflammatory bowel diseases, weight gain, and other metabolic syndromes.

== Around the world ==


Around the world, different cultures have developed unique versions of ice cream, suiting the product to local tastes and preferences.

The most traditional Argentine (ice cream) is very similar to Italian gelato, in large part due to the historical influence of Italian immigrants on Argentine customs.

Per capita, Australians and New Zealanders are among the leading ice cream consumers in the world, eating and each per year respectively, behind the United States where people eat each per year.

In China, besides the popular flavours such as vanilla, chocolate, coffee, mango and strawberry, many Chinese ice-cream manufacturers have also introduced other traditional Chinese flavours such as black sesame and red bean.

In Greece, ice cream in its modern form, or (), was introduced at least from the middle of the 19th century.

India is one of the largest producers of ice cream in the world, but most of its ice cream is consumed domestically. One of its most well-known ice creams is the &quot;kulfi&quot; available in both usual and local flavours like mango, rose, &quot;badam&quot; (almond), strawberry, &quot;kesar&quot; (saffron), pistachio, chocolate and can contain nuts, rose petals, saffron stalks, and pieces of other sweets like rabdri and gulab jamun.

&quot;Golas&quot; are summer treat consisting of shaved ice packed into a popsicle form on a stick and soaked in flavoured sugar syrup, a popular choice being &quot;kala khatta&quot;, made from the sweet and sour jamun fruit.

In Indonesia, a type of traditional ice cream called or &quot;stirred ice cream&quot; is made from coconut milk, pandanus leaves, sugar—and flavours that include avocado, jackfruit, durian, palm sugar, chocolate, red bean, and mung bean.

In Iran, () or (Persian: ) is a Persian sorbet made of thin vermicelli noodles, frozen with sugar syrup and rose water. The dessert is often served with lime juice and sometimes ground pistachios.

Italian ice cream, or gelato as it is known, is a traditional and popular dessert in Italy. Much of the production is still hand-made and flavoured by each individual shop in &quot;produzione propria&quot; gelaterias. Gelato is made from whole milk, sugar, sometimes eggs, and natural flavourings. Gelato typically contains 7–8% fat, less than ice cream&#x27;s minimum of 10%.

 is a Philippine version of common ice cream usually peddled from carts by peddlers who roam streets in the Philippines. Despite the similarities between the name and &quot;sorbet&quot;, is not a type of sorbet.

In Spain, ice cream is often in the style of Italian gelato. Spanish can be found in many cafés or speciality ice cream stores. While many traditional flavours are sold, cafés may also sell flavours like nata, viola, crema catalana, or tiramisu. In the 1980s, the Spanish industry was known for creating many creative and weird ice cream bars.

In Syria, there is a traditional ice cream called booza. It is made by freezing dairy milk with mastic and sahlab (salep), giving it a distinctive stretchy and chewy texture.

 is the name given to ice cream in Turkey. Dondurma typically includes milk, sugar, salep, and mastic.

In the United Kingdom, 14million adults buy ice cream as a treat, in a market worth £1.8billion (according to a report produced in 2024). In the United States, ice cream made with just cream, sugar, and a flavouring (usually fruit) is sometimes referred to as &quot;Philadelphia style&quot; ice cream. Ice cream that uses eggs to make a custard is sometimes called &quot;French ice cream&quot;. American federal labelling standards require ice cream to contain a minimum of 10% milk fat. Americans consume about 23 litres of ice cream per person per year—the most in the world. According to the NPD Group, the most popular ice cream flavours in the U.S. are vanilla and chocolate with a combined market share of 40% as of 2008.

== Cones ==

&quot;Mrs A. B. Marshall&#x27;s Cookery Book&quot;, published in 1888, endorsed serving ice cream in cones. Agnes Marshall was a celebrated cookery writer of her day and helped to popularize ice cream. She patented and manufactured an ice cream maker and was the first to suggest using liquefied gases to freeze ice cream after seeing a demonstration at the Royal Institution.

Reliable evidence proves that ice cream cones were served in the 19th century, and their popularity increased greatly during the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair in 1904. According to legend, an ice cream vendor at the fair ran out of cardboard dishes. The vendor at the Syrian waffle booth next door, unsuccessful in the intense heat, offered to make cones by rolling up his waffles. The new product sold well and was widely copied by other vendors.

== Cryogenics ==
In 2006, some commercial ice cream makers began to use liquid nitrogen in the primary freezing of ice cream, thus eliminating the need for a conventional ice cream freezer. The preparation results in a column of white condensed water vapour cloud. The ice cream, dangerous to eat while still &quot;steaming&quot; with liquid nitrogen, is allowed to rest until the liquid nitrogen is completely vaporized. Sometimes ice cream is frozen to the sides of the container, and must be allowed to thaw. Good results can also be achieved with the more readily available dry ice, and authors such as Heston Blumenthal have published recipes to produce ice cream and sorbet using a simple blender.

<text>In economics, a commodity is an economic good, usually a resource, that specifically has full or substantial fungibility: that is, the market treats instances of the good as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them. 

The price of a commodity good is typically determined as a function of its market as a whole: well-established physical commodities have actively traded spot and derivative markets. The wide availability of commodities typically leads to smaller profit margins and diminishes the importance of factors (such as brand name) other than price. 

Most commodities are raw materials, basic resources, agricultural, or mining products, such as iron ore, sugar, or grains like rice and wheat. Commodities can also be mass-produced unspecialized products such as chemicals and computer memory. Popular commodities include crude oil, corn, gold.

Other definitions of commodity include something useful or valued and an alternative term for an economic good or service available for purchase in the market. In such standard works as Alfred Marshall&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Economics&quot; (1920) and Léon Walras&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Pure Economics&quot; ([1926] 1954) &#x27;commodity&#x27; serves as general term for an economic good or service.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;commodity&quot; came into use in English in the 15th century, from the French &quot;commodité&quot;, &quot;amenity, convenience&quot;. Going further back, the French word derives from the Latin &quot;commoditas&quot;, meaning &quot;suitability, convenience, advantage&quot;. The Latin word &quot;commodus&quot; (from which English gets other words including &quot;commodious&quot; and &quot;accommodate&quot;) meant variously &quot;appropriate&quot;, &quot;proper measure, time, or condition&quot;, and &quot;advantage, benefit&quot;.

== Description ==

===Characteristics=== 
In economics, the term &quot;commodity&quot; is used specifically for economic goods that have full or partial but substantial fungibility; that is, the market treats their instances as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them. Karl Marx described this property as follows: &quot;From the taste of wheat, it is not possible to tell who produced it, a Russian serf, a French peasant or an English capitalist.&quot; Petroleum and copper are examples of commodity goods: their supply and demand are a part of one universal market.

Non-commodity items such as stereo systems have many aspects of product differentiation, such as the brand, the user interface and the perceived quality. The demand for one type of stereo may be much larger than demand for another.

The price of a commodity good is typically determined as a function of its market as a whole. Well-established physical commodities have actively traded spot and derivative markets.

=== Hard and soft commodities ===

Soft commodities are goods that are grown, such as wheat, or rice.

Hard commodities are mined. Examples include gold, silver, helium, oil.

Energy commodities include electricity, gas, coal and oil. Electricity has the particular characteristic that it is usually uneconomical to store, and must therefore be consumed as soon as it is produced.

== Commoditization ==

Commoditization occurs as a goods or services market loses differentiation across its supply base, often by the diffusion of the intellectual capital necessary to acquire or produce it efficiently. As such, goods that formerly carried premium margins for market have become commodities, such as generic pharmaceuticals and DRAM chips. An article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; cites multivitamin supplements as an example of commoditization; a 50 mg tablet of calcium is of equal value to a consumer no matter what company produces and markets it, and as such, multivitamins are now sold in bulk and are available at any supermarket with little brand differentiation. Following this trend, nanomaterials are emerging from carrying premium profit margins for market participants to a status of commodification.

There is a spectrum of commoditization, rather than a binary distinction of &quot;commodity versus differentiable product&quot;. Few products have complete undifferentiability and hence fungibility; even electricity can be differentiated in the market based on its method of generation (e.g., fossil fuel, wind, solar), in markets where energy choice lets a buyer opt (and pay more) for renewable methods if desired. Many products&#x27; degree of commoditization depends on the buyer&#x27;s mentality and means. For example, milk, eggs, and notebook paper are not differentiated by many customers; for them, the product is fungible and lowest price is the main decisive factor in the purchasing choice. Other customers take into consideration other factors besides price, such as environmental sustainability and animal welfare. To these customers, distinctions such as &quot;organic versus not&quot; or &quot;cage free versus not&quot; count toward differentiating brands of milk or eggs, and percentage of recycled content or Forest Stewardship Council certification count toward differentiating brands of notebook paper.

==Commodity trade==

In the original and simplified sense, commodities were things of value, of uniform quality, that were produced in large quantities by many different producers; the items from each different producer were considered equivalent. On a commodity exchange, it is the underlying standard stated in the contract that defines the commodity, not any quality inherent in a specific producer&#x27;s product.

Commodities exchanges include:
* Bourse Africa (formerly GBOT)
* Bursa Malaysia Derivatives (MDEX)
* Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT)
* Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)
* Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE)
* Euronext.liffe (LIFFE)
* Kansas City Board of Trade (KCBT)
* London Metal Exchange (LME)
* Marché à Terme International de France (MATIF)
* Mercantile Exchange Nepal Limited (MEX)
* Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX)
* National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX)
* National Commodity Exchange Limited (NCEL)
* New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX)
* Yiwu International Trade City(Yiwu Market)
Markets for trading commodities can be very efficient, particularly if the division into pools matches demand segments. These markets will quickly respond to changes in supply and demand to find an equilibrium price and quantity. In addition, investors can gain passive exposure to the commodity markets through a commodity price index.

In order to diversify their investments and mitigate the risks associated with inflationary debasement of currencies, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds allocate capital to non-listed assets such as a commodities and commodity-related infrastructure.

== Inventory data ==
The inventory of commodities, with low inventories typically leading to more volatile future prices and increasing the risk of a &quot;stockout&quot; (inventory exhaustion). According to economist theorists, companies receive a convenience yield by holding inventories of certain commodities. Data on inventories of commodities are not available from one common source, although data is available from various sources. Inventory data on 31 commodities was used in a 2006 study on the relationship between inventories and commodity futures risk premiums.

==Commodification of labour==
In classical political economy and especially in Karl Marx&#x27;s critique of political economy, a commodity is an object or a good or service (&quot;product&quot; or &quot;activity&quot;) produced by human labour. Objects are external to man. However, some objects attain &quot;use value&quot; to persons in this world, when they are found to be &quot;necessary, useful or pleasant in life&quot;. &quot;Use value&quot; makes an object &quot;an object of human wants&quot;, or &quot;a means of subsistence in the widest sense&quot;.

As society developed, people found that they could trade goods and services for other goods and services. At this stage, these goods and services became &quot;commodities&quot;. According to Marx, commodities are defined as objects which are offered for sale or are &quot;exchanged in a market&quot;. In the marketplace, where commodities are sold, &quot;use value&quot; is not helpful in facilitating the sale of commodities. Accordingly, in addition to having use value, commodities must have an &quot;exchange value&quot;—a value that could be expressed in the market.

Prior to Marx, many economists debated as to what elements made up exchange value. Adam Smith maintained that exchange value was made up of rent, profit, labour and the costs of wear and tear on the instruments of husbandry. David Ricardo, a follower of Adam Smith, modified Smith&#x27;s approach on this point by alleging that labour alone is the content of the exchange value of any good or service. While maintaining that all exchange value in commodities was derived directly from the hands of the people that made the commodity, Ricardo noted that only part of the exchange value of the commodity was paid to the worker who made the commodity. The other part of the value of this particular commodity was labour that was not paid to the worker—unpaid labour. This unpaid labour was retained by the owner of the means of production. In capitalist society, the capitalist owns the means of production and therefore the unpaid labour is retained by the capitalist as rent or as profit. The means of production means the site where the commodity is made, the raw products that are used in the production and the instruments or machines that are used for the production of the commodity.

However, not all commodities are reproducible nor were all commodities originally intended to be sold in the market. These priced goods are also treated as commodities, e.g. human labour-power, works of art and natural resources (&quot;earth itself is an instrument of labour&quot;), even though they may not be produced specifically for the market, or be non-reproducible goods.

Marx&#x27;s analysis of the commodity is intended to help solve the problem of what establishes the economic value of goods, using the labour theory of value. This problem was extensively debated by Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Karl Rodbertus-Jagetzow among others.

All three of the above-mentioned economists rejected the theory that labour composed 100% of the exchange value of any commodity. In varying degrees, these economists turned to supply and demand to establish the price of commodities. Marx held that the &quot;price&quot; and the &quot;value&quot; of a commodity were not synonymous. Price of any commodity would vary according to the imbalance of supply to demand at any one period of time. The &quot;value&quot; of the same commodity would be consistent and would reflect the amount of labour value used to produce that commodity.

Prior to Marx, economists noted that the problem with using the &quot;quantity of labour&quot; to establish the value of commodities was that the time spent by an unskilled worker would be longer than the time spent on the same commodity by a skilled worker. Thus, under this analysis, the commodity produced by an unskilled worker would be more valuable than the same commodity produced by the skilled worker. Marx pointed out, however, that in society at large, an average amount of time that was necessary to produce the commodity would arise. This average time necessary to produce the commodity Marx called the &quot;socially necessary labour time&quot;. Socially necessary labour time was the proper basis on which to base the &quot;exchange value&quot; of a given commodity.

== Commodity Super Cycle ==
Commodity Super Cycles are periods of time, around a decade, where commodities as a whole trade at a price that is greater than their long term moving average. A Super Cycle will usually occur when there is large industrial and commercial change in a country or world that requires more resources to support the change. As prices rise, goods and services that rely on commodities rise with them.

=== History of Super Cycles ===
There have been four super cycles over the last 120 years worldwide. The first commodity super cycle started in late 1890 and was accelerated on the back of widespread U.S. industrialization and World War 1. In 1917 commodity prices peaked and then entered a downtrend to the 1930s. As war erupted in Europe in the late 1930s and eventually including the U.S. the world saw a new cycle begin. Countries were not just preparing for war but also the Aftermath of World War II as lots of Europe and Asia faced heavy rebuilding. This cycle eventually peaked in 1951 and faded away in the early 70s. In the 1970s as world economies grew they needed more materials and energy to support expansion leading to increases in prices across the board. This boom came to an end as foreign investments fled as extractive industries became nationalized. The most recent of commodity super cycles began in 2000 as China joined the World Trade Organization. China was also in the beginning of their boom as industry and expansion took off. Workers moved into cities as emerging industries took off and offered a lots of new jobs and opportunities. In 2008 when the Great Recession hit it put a halt onto the supercycle as GDP&#x27;s across the world tanked leaving many economies in recessions.

The next or the fifth supercycle could arrive as the world enters the final phases of the COVID-19 pandemic and starts to build massive clean energy infrastructure in view of the commodity price increase.

<text>Torquato Tasso ( , , ; 11 March 154425 April 1595) was an Italian poet of the 16th century, known for his 1591 poem &quot;Gerusalemme liberata&quot; (Jerusalem Delivered), in which he depicts a highly imaginative version of the combats between Christians and Muslims at the end of the First Crusade, during the Siege of Jerusalem of 1099.

Tasso had mental illness and died a few days before he was to be crowned on the Capitoline Hill as the king of poets by Pope Clement VIII. His work was widely translated and adapted, and until the beginning of the 20th century, he remained one of the most widely read poets in Europe.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in Sorrento, Torquato was the son of Bernardo Tasso, a nobleman of Bergamo and an epic and lyric poet of considerable fame in his day, and his wife Porzia de Rossi, a noblewoman born in Naples of Tuscan origins. His father had for many years been secretary in the service of Ferrante Sanseverino, Prince of Salerno, and his mother was closely connected with the most illustrious Neapolitan families. When, during the boy&#x27;s childhood, the prince of Salerno came into collision with the Spanish government of Naples, being subsequently outlawed and deprived of his hereditary fiefs, Tasso&#x27;s father shared his patron&#x27;s fate. He was proclaimed a rebel to the state, along with his son Torquato, and his patrimony was sequestered. In 1552 Torquato was living with his mother and his only sister Cornelia at Naples, pursuing his education under the Jesuits, who had recently opened a school there. The precocity of intellect and the religious fervour of the boy attracted general admiration. At the age of eight he was already famous.

Soon after this date he was allowed to join his father, who then lived in great poverty and unemployment in exile in Rome. News reached them in 1556 that Porzia Tasso had died suddenly and mysteriously at Naples. Her husband was firmly convinced that she had been poisoned by her brother with the object of getting control over her property.

As it subsequently happened, Porzia&#x27;s estate never descended to her son; and the daughter Cornelia married below her birth, at the instigation of her maternal relatives. Tasso&#x27;s father was a poet by predilection and a professional courtier. Therefore, when an opening at the court of Urbino was offered in 1557, Bernardo Tasso gladly accepted it.

The young Torquato, a handsome and brilliant lad, became the companion in sports and studies of Francesco Maria della Rovere, heir to the duke of Urbino. At Urbino a society of cultivated men pursued the aesthetic and literary studies which were then in vogue. Bernardo Tasso read cantos of his poem &quot;L&#x27;Amadigi&quot; to the duchess and her ladies, or discussed the merits of Homer and Virgil, Trissino and Ariosto, with the duke&#x27;s librarians and secretaries. Torquato grew up in an atmosphere of refined luxury and somewhat pedantic criticism, both of which gave a permanent tone to his character.

At Venice, where his father went to superintend the printing of his own epic, &quot;L&#x27;Amadigi&quot; (1560), these influences continued. He found himself the pet and prodigy of a distinguished literary circle but Bernardo had suffered in his own career so seriously from dependence on his writings and the nobility, that he now determined on a lucrative profession for his son. Torquato was sent to study law at Padua. Instead of applying himself to law, the young man bestowed all his attention upon philosophy and poetry. Before the end of 1562, he had produced a twelve-canto epic poem called &quot;Rinaldo&quot;, which was meant to combine the regularity of the Virgilian with the attractions of the romantic epic. In the attainment of this object, and in all the minor qualities of style and handling, &quot;Rinaldo&quot; showed marked originality, although other parts seem unfinished and betray the haste in which the poem was composed. Nevertheless, its author was recognized as the most promising young poet of his time. The flattered father allowed the work to be printed; and, after a short period of study at Bologna, he consented to his son&#x27;s entering the service of Cardinal Luigi d&#x27;Este. Even before that date, the young Tasso had been a frequent visitor at the Este court in Ferrara, where in 1561 he had encountered Lucrezia Bendidio, one of Eleanora d&#x27;Este&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting, and fallen in love with her. She became the addressee of his first series of love sonnets, to be followed in 1563 by Laura Peperara, the next object of Tasso&#x27;s affections. Both Lucrezia and Laura had in the meantime become well known singers, and for a while Tasso seems to have courted them both.

===France and Ferrara===
From 1565, Tasso&#x27;s life was centered on the castle at Ferrara, the scene of many later glories and cruel sufferings. After the publication of &quot;Rinaldo&quot; he had expressed his views upon the epic in some &quot;Discourses on the Art of Poetry&quot;, which committed him to a distinct theory and gained for him the additional celebrity of a philosophical critic. The next five years seem to have been the happiest of Tasso&#x27;s life, although his father&#x27;s death in 1569 caused his affectionate nature profound pain. Young, handsome, accomplished in all the exercises of a well-bred gentleman, accustomed to the society of the great and learned, illustrious by his published works in verse and prose, he became the idol of the most brilliant court in Italy. The first two books of his five-hundred-odd love poems were addressed to Lucrezia Bendidio and Laura Peverara. The princesses Lucrezia and Eleonora d&#x27;Este, both unmarried, both his seniors by about ten years, took him under their protection. He was admitted to their familiarity. He owed much to the constant kindness of both sisters. In 1570 he traveled to Paris with the cardinal.

Frankness of speech and a certain habitual want of tact caused a disagreement with his worldly patron. He left France next year, and took service under Duke Alfonso II of Ferrara, the Cardinal&#x27;s brother. The most important events in Tasso&#x27;s biography during the following four years are the completion of &quot;Aminta&quot; in 1573 and &quot;Gerusalemme Liberata&quot; in 1574. &quot;Aminta&quot; is a pastoral drama of very simple plot, but of exquisite lyrical charm. It appeared at the moment when music, under the influence of composers like Palestrina, Monteverdi, Marenzio and others, was becoming the dominant art of Italy. The honeyed melodies and sensuous melancholy of &quot;Aminta&quot; exactly suited and interpreted the spirit of its age. Its influence, in opera and cantata, was felt through two successive centuries. &quot;Aminta&quot;, played by courtiers in an island of Po river where the duke had his &quot;Giardino di delizie&quot;, was first printed by Aldus Manutius the Younger in Venice in January 1581. A Croatian translation of &quot;Aminta&quot; by the poet Dominko Zlatarić, &quot;Ljubmir, pripovijest pastijerska&quot;, was printed one year before the original, also in Venice.

===The &quot;Gerusalemme Liberata&quot;===
The &quot;Gerusalemme Liberata&quot; or &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot; occupies a larger space in the history of European literature, and is a more considerable work. Yet the commanding qualities of this epic poem, those which revealed Tasso&#x27;s individuality, and which made it immediately pass into the rank of classics, beloved by the people no less than by persons of culture, are akin to the lyrical graces of &quot;Aminta&quot;.

In the &quot;Gerusalemme Liberata&quot;, as in the &quot;Rinaldo&quot;, Tasso aimed at ennobling the Italian epic style by preserving strict unity of plot and heightening poetic diction. He chose Virgil for his model, took the First Crusade for subject, infused the fervour of religion into his conception of the hero, Godfrey. But his natural bent was for romance.

As he had done in &quot;Rinaldo&quot;, Tasso adorned &quot;Gerusalemme Liberata&quot; with a number of romantic episodes, which have proved more popular and influential than the grand sweep of the main theme. Thus, while the nominal hero of &quot;Gerusalemme Liberata&quot; is Godfrey of Bouillon (&quot;Goffredo&quot;), the leader of the First Crusade, and the climax of the epic is the capture of the holy city, Tasso&#x27;s Goffredo, who is a mixture of Virgil&#x27;s pious Aeneas and Tridentine Catholicism, is not the real hero of the epic. Instead, the reader is attracted to the stories of Ruggiero, fiery and passionate Rinaldo, melancholy and impulsive Tancredi, and also by the chivalrous Saracens with whom they clash in love and war.

The action of the epic turns on three stories of interaction between noble beautiful pagan women and these Crusaders. &quot;Armida&quot;, a beautiful witch, is sent forth by the infernal senate to sow discord in the Christian camp. Instead, she is converted to the true faith by her adoration for a crusading knight, and quits the scene with a phrase of the Virgin Mary on her lips. Clorinda, a brave female warrior, dons armor like Ariosto&#x27;s Marfisa, fights a duel with her devoted lover, and receives baptism at his hands as she lies dying. Finally, Erminia, hopelessly in love with Tancredi, seeks refuge in the shepherds&#x27; hut.

These stories rivet the reader&#x27;s attention, while the battles, religious ceremonies, conclaves and stratagems of the campaign are less engaging. Tasso&#x27;s great invention as an artist was the poetry of sentiment. Sentiment, not sentimentality, gives value to what is immortal in the &quot;Gerusalemme&quot;. It was a new thing in the 16th century, something concordant with a growing feeling for woman and with the ascendant art of music. This sentiment, refined, noble, natural, steeped in melancholy, exquisitely graceful, pathetically touching, breathes throughout the episodes of the &quot;Gerusalemme&quot;, finds metrical expression in the languishing cadence of its mellifluous verse, and sustains the ideal life of those seductive heroines whose names were familiar as household words to all Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.

The epic was finished in Tasso&#x27;s thirty-first year; when the manuscripts lay before him the best part of his life was over, his best work had been already accomplished. Troubles immediately began to gather round him. Instead of having the courage to obey his own instinct, and to publish the &quot;Gerusalemme&quot; as he had conceived it, he yielded to the excessive scrupulosity which formed a feature of his paranoid character. The poem was sent in manuscript to a large committee of eminent literary men, Tasso expressing his willingness to hear their strictures and to adopt their suggestions unless he could convert them to his own views. The result was that each of these candid friends, while expressing in general high admiration for the epic, took some exception to its plot, its title, its moral tone, its episodes or its diction, in detail. One wished it to be more regularly classical; another wanted more romance. One hinted that the Inquisition would not tolerate its supernatural machinery; another demanded the excision of its most charming passages, the loves of &quot;Armida&quot;, &quot;Clorinda&quot; and &quot;Erminia&quot;. Tasso had to defend himself against all these ineptitudes and pedantries, and to accommodate his practice to the theories he had rashly expressed.

Tasso&#x27;s self-chosen critics were not men to admit what the public has since accepted as incontrovertible. They vaguely felt that a great and beautiful romantic poem was imbedded in a dull and not very correct epic. In their uneasiness they suggested every course but the right one, which was to publish the &quot;Gerusalemme&quot; without further dispute.

Tasso, already overworked by his precocious studies, by exciting court life and exhausting literary industry, now grew almost mad with worry. His health began to fail him. He complained of headache, malarious fevers, and wished to leave Ferrara. The &quot;Gerusalemme&quot; was laid in manuscript upon a shelf. He opened negotiations with the court of Florence for an exchange of service. This irritated the duke of Ferrara. Alfonso hated nothing more than to see courtiers (especially famous ones) leave him for a rival duchy. Moreover, Alfonso was married to a French Calvinist princess and thus justly worried about antagonizing the more orthodox powers in Italy, concentrated in Florence and Rome.

===Difficult relationships in the Court of Ferrara===

Alfonso thought, moreover, that, if Tasso were allowed to go, the Medici would get the coveted dedication of that already famous epic. Therefore, he bore with the poet&#x27;s humours, and so contrived that the latter should have no excuse for quitting Ferrara. Meanwhile, through the years 1575, 1576 and 1577, Tasso&#x27;s health grew worse.

Jealousy inspired the courtiers to malign and insult him. His irritable and suspicious temper, vain and sensitive to slights, rendered him only too easy a prey to their malevolence.

In the course of the 1570s Tasso developed a persecution mania which led to legends about the restless, half-mad, and misunderstood author. He became consumed by thoughts that his servants betrayed his confidence, fancied he had been denounced to the Inquisition, and expected daily to be poisoned. Literary and political events surrounding him upset his mental state, escalating his stress and social troubles.

In the autumn of 1576 Tasso quarrelled with a Ferrarese gentleman, Maddalo, who had talked too freely about some same-sex love affair; the same year he wrote a letter to his homosexual friend Luca Scalabrino dealing with his own love for a 21-year-old young man Orazio Ariosto; in the summer of 1577 he drew his knife upon a servant in the presence of Lucrezia d&#x27;Este, duchess of Urbino. For this excess he was arrested; but the duke released him, and took him for a change of air to his country seat of Villa Belriguardo. What happened there is not known. Some biographers have surmised that a compromising liaison with Leonora d&#x27;Este came to light, and that Tasso agreed to feign madness in order to cover her honour, but of this, there is no proof. It is only certain that from Belriguardo he returned to a Franciscan convent at Ferrara, for the express purpose of attending to his health. There the dread of being murdered by the duke took a firm hold on his mind. He escaped at the end of July, disguised himself as a peasant, and went on foot to his sister at Sorrento.

The conclusions were that Tasso, after the beginning of 1575, developed a mental malady, which, without amounting to actual insanity, rendered him fantastical and insupportable, a cause of anxiety to his patrons. There is no evidence whatsoever for the later romantic myth that this state of things was due to an overwhelming passion for Leonora. The duke, contrary to his image as a tyrant, showed considerable forbearance. Though a rigid and unsympathetic man, as egotistical as any princeling of his era, to Tasso he was never cruel; unintelligent perhaps, but far from being that monster of ferocity as which was later portrayed. The subsequent history of his connection with the poet corroborates this view.

While with his sister at Sorrento, Tasso yearned for Ferrara. The court-made man could not breathe freely outside its charmed circle. He wrote humbly requesting to be taken back. Alfonso consented, provided Tasso would agree to undergo a medical course of treatment for his melancholy. When he returned, which he did with alacrity under those conditions, he was well received by the ducal family.

All might have gone well if his old maladies had not revived. Scene followed scene of irritability, moodiness, suspicion, wounded vanity and violent outbursts.

===In the madhouse of St. Anna===
In the summer of 1578 he ran away again, travelling through Mantua, Padua, Venice, and Urbino Lombardy. In September he reached the gates of Turin on foot and was courteously entertained by Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy. Wherever he went, wandering like the world&#x27;s rejected guest, he met with the honour due his illustrious name. Great folk gladly opened their houses to him, partly in compassion, partly in admiration of his genius. But he soon wearied of their society and wore their kindness thin by his querulous peevishness. It seemed, moreover, that life was intolerable to him outside Ferrara. Accordingly, he once more opened negotiations with the duke; and in February 1579 he again set foot in the castle.

Alfonso was about to contract his third marriage, this time with a princess of the house of Mantua. He had no children, and unless he got an heir there was a probability that his state would fall to the Holy See, as in fact it eventually did. The nuptial festivals, on the eve of which Tasso arrived, were therefore not an occasion of great rejoicing for the elderly bridegroom. As a forlorn hope Alfonso had to wed a third wife; but his heart was not in it and his expectations were far from sanguine.

Tasso, preoccupied as always with his own sorrows and his own sense of dignity, made no allowance for the troubles of his master. Rooms below his rank, he thought, had been assigned him; the Duke was engaged. Without exercising common patience, or giving his old friends the benefit of the doubt, Tasso broke into terms of open abuse, behaved like a lunatic, and was sent off without ceremony to the madhouse of St. Anna. This happened in March 1579, and there he remained until July 1586. Duke Alfonso&#x27;s long patience at last had given way. He firmly believed that Tasso was insane, and he felt that if he were so St. Anna was the safest place for him.

After the first few months of his incarceration, he obtained spacious apartments, received the visits of friends, went abroad attended by responsible persons of his acquaintance, and was allowed to correspond freely with others. The letters written from St. Anna to the princes and cities of Italy, to warm well-wishers, and to men of the highest reputation in the world of art and learning, form the most valuable source of information, not only on his then condition, but also on his temperament at large. It is singular that he spoke always respectfully, even affectionately, of the Duke. Some critics have attempted to make it appear that he was hypocritically kissing the hand which had chastised him, with the view of being released from prison, but no one who has impartially considered the whole tone and tenor of his epistles will adopt this opinion. What emerges clearly from them is that he laboured under a serious mental disease, and that he was conscious of it.

Meanwhile, he occupied his uneasy leisure with copious compositions. The mass of his prose dialogues on philosophical and ethical themes, which is very considerable, belong to the years of imprisonment in St. Anna. Except for occasional odes or sonnets—some written at request, others inspired by his keen sense of suffering and therefore poignant, he neglected poetry. In the year 1580, he heard that part of the &quot;Gerusalemme&quot; was being published without his permission and without his corrections. The following year, the whole poem was given to the world, and in the following six months seven editions issued from the press.

The prisoner of St. Anna had no control over his editors; and from the masterpiece which placed him on the level of Petrarch and Ariosto he never derived one penny of pecuniary profit. A rival poet at the court of Ferrara undertook to revise and edit his lyrics in 1582. This was Battista Guarini; and Tasso, in his cell, had to allow odes and sonnets, poems of personal feeling, occasional pieces of compliment, to be collected and emended, without lifting a voice in the matter.

A few years later, in 1585, two Florentine pedants of the Crusca Academy declared war against the &quot;Gerusalemme&quot;. They loaded it with insults, which seem to those who read their pamphlets now mere parodies of criticism. Yet Tasso felt bound to reply; and he did so with a moderation and urbanity which prove him to have been not only in full possession of his reasoning faculties, but a gentleman of noble manners also. The man, like Hamlet, was distraught through ill accommodation to his circumstances and his age; brain-sick he was undoubtedly; and this is the Duke of Ferrara&#x27;s justification for the treatment he endured. In the prison, he bore himself pathetically, peevishly, but never ignobly.

What remained over, untouched by the malady, unoppressed by his consciousness thereof, displayed a sweet and gravely-toned humanity. The oddest thing about his life in prison is that he was always trying to place his two nephews, the sons of his sister Cornelia, in court service. One of them he attached to Guglielmo I, Duke of Mantua, the other to Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma.

===Late years===
In 1586 Tasso left St. Anna at the solicitation of Vincenzo Gonzaga, Prince of Mantua. He followed his young deliverer to the city by the Mincio, basked awhile in liberty and courtly pleasures, enjoyed a splendid reception from his paternal town of Bergamo, and reworked his 1573 tragedy &quot;Galealto Re di Norvegia&quot; into a classical drama entitled &quot;Torrismondo&quot;. But only a few months passed before he grew discontented. Vincenzo Gonzaga, succeeding to his father&#x27;s dukedom of Mantua, had scanty leisure to bestow upon the poet. Tasso felt neglected. In the autumn of 1587, he journeyed through Bologna and Loreto to Rome where he took up quarters with an old friend, Scipione Gonzaga, now Patriarch of Jerusalem. The following year he wandered off to Naples, where he wrote several religious poems including Monte Oliveto. In 1589 he returned to Rome and took quarters again with the patriarch of Jerusalem. But the servants found Tasso insufferable and turned him out of doors. He fell ill and went to a hospital. The patriarch in 1590 again received him, but Tasso&#x27;s restless spirit drove him forth to Florence. The Florentines said, &quot;Actum est de eo.&quot; Rome once more, then Mantua, then Florence, then Rome, then Naples, then Rome, then Naples—such is the weary record of the years 1590–94. He endured a veritable Odyssey of malady, indigence and misfortune. To Tasso, everything was amiss. Though the palaces of princes, cardinals, patriarchs, nay popes, were always open to him, he could rest in none.

His health grew ever feebler and his genius dimmer. In 1592 he published a revised version of the &quot;Gerusalemme&quot;, &quot;Gerusalemme Conquistata&quot;. All that made the poem of his early manhood charming he rigidly erased. The versification became more pedantic; the romantic and magical episodes were excised; the heavier elements of the plot underwent dull rhetorical development. During the same year a blank-verse retelling of &quot;Genesis&quot;, called &quot;Le Sette Giornate&quot;, saw the light.

Though mental disorder, physical weakness, and a decline in inspiration seemed to doom Tasso to oblivion, hope cheered his last years. Pope Clement VIII ascended the papal chair in 1592. He and his nephew, Cardinal Aldobrandini of San Giorgio, were determined to befriend the poet. In 1594 they invited him to Rome. There Tasso was to receive the crown of laurels, as Petrarch had been crowned, on the Capitol.

Worn out with illness, Tasso reached Rome in November. The ceremony of his coronation was deferred because Cardinal Aldobrandini had fallen ill. But the pope assigned Tasso a pension. Also, under pontifical pressure, Prince Avellino (who held Tasso&#x27;s maternal estate) agreed to discharge a portion of his claims against Tasso by payment of a yearly stipend.

At no time since Tasso left St. Anna had the heavens so smiled upon him. Capitolian honours and money were now at his disposal. Yet fortune arrived too late. Before he donned the crown of poet laureate and received his pensions, Tasso went to the hilltop convent of Sant&#x27;Onofrio on a stormy 1 April 1595. After his coach toiled up the steep Trasteverine Hill and the monks came to the door to greet it, Tasso stepped out and announced to the prior that he had come there to die.

Tasso died in Sant&#x27;Onofrio in April 1595 aged 51. The last twenty years of his existence had been practically and artistically unsatisfying.

==Other works==
&quot;Rime&quot; (Rhymes), nearly two thousand lyrics in nine books, were written between 1567 and 1593, influenced by Petrarch&#x27;s &quot;Canzoniere&quot; (&quot;Songbook&quot;).

&quot;Galealto re di Norvegia&quot; (1573–4) is an unfinished tragedy, which was later finished under a new title: &quot;Re Torrismondo&quot; (1587). It is influenced by the tragedies of Sophocles and Seneca, and tells the story of princess Alvida of Norway, who is forcibly married off to the Goth king Torrismondo, when she is devoted to her childhood friend, king Germondo of Sweden.

In &quot;Messaggiero (The Messenger)&quot; (1582), Tasso touches on the nature of the diplomat.

&quot;Dialoghi&quot; (&quot;Dialogues&quot;), written between 1578 and 1594. These 28 texts deal with issues from morality (love, virtue, nobility) to the mundane (masks, play, courtly style, beauty). Sometimes Tasso touches on major themes of his time, such as religion vs. intellectual freedom; Christianity vs. Islam at Lepanto.

&quot;Discorsi del poema eroico&quot;, published in 1594, is the main text for Tasso&#x27;s poetics. It was probably written in the years while he was working on &quot;Gerusalemme Liberata&quot;.

==Mental illness==

The disease Tasso had is now believed to be bipolarity. Legends describe him wandering the streets of Rome half-mad, convinced that he was being persecuted. After his lengthy imprisonment in Ferrara&#x27;s Santa Anna lunatic asylum, he was able to resume his writing, although he never fully recovered.

== Influence ==
*Tasso&#x27;s lyric poetry may have had some influence in late Renaissance France on Desportes and Ronsard (whom Tasso met in Paris). It almost certainly influenced a number of English Elizabethans, including Sir Philip Sidney, Abraham Fraunce and Samuel Daniel.
*Claudio Monteverdi composed &quot;Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda&quot; upon the text of &quot;Gerusalemme Liberata&quot;, canto XII. He also composed music over some of Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Rime&quot;, particularly madrigals.
*Giaches de Wert and Carlo Gesualdo da Venosa put into music many texts from Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Rime&quot; and &quot;Gerusalemme&quot;.
*The German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote a play, &quot;Torquato Tasso&quot;, in 1790, which explores the struggles of the artist. He also composed a cantata text, &quot;Rinaldo&quot;, inspired by canto XVI of &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot;, later set to music by Johannes Brahms.
* Giacomo Leopardi wrote &quot;Dialogo di Torquato Tasso e del suo Genio familiare&quot; (&quot;Operette morali&quot;, 1824), a prose about the long stay in St. Anna. The main theme is a comparison between pain and boredom, expressed in a dialogue between Tasso and a &quot;Genius&quot;, or ghost, said to be visiting him in his loneliness.
*Among the numerous operas based on &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot; are works by Lully, Alessandro Scarlatti, Vivaldi, Handel, Haydn, Salieri, Cherubini, Christoph Willibald Gluck, Rossini and Dvořák. An experimental modern opera on the theme, by Judith Weir, transposes the scene into contemporary Iraq.
*Both Edmund Spenser and John Milton were greatly influenced by Tasso&#x27;s work.
*Lord Byron&#x27;s poem &quot;The Lament of Tasso&quot; narrates Tasso&#x27;s spell in St. Anna&#x27;s hospital.
*The Italian composer Gaetano Donizetti wrote an opera on the subject of &quot;Torquato Tasso&quot; (1833) and incorporated some of the poet&#x27;s writing into the libretto.
*Felicia Hemans&#x27;s poem &quot;Tasso&#x27;s Coronation&quot; records the poet&#x27;s death immediately prior to his intended crowning.
*Letitia Elizabeth Landon published her poem &quot;Tasso&#x27;s last interview with the Princess Leonora&quot; as a Metrical Fragment in 1826.
*Franz Liszt composed a symphonic poem, &quot;Tasso, Lamento e Trionfo&quot;, in commemoration of the centenary of Goethe&#x27;s birth. 
*Artists inspired by both &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot; and &quot;Aminta&quot; have been legion and include Tintoretto, the Carracci, Guercino, Pietro da Cortona, Domenichino, Cigoli, Van Dyck, Poussin, Claude Lorrain, Tiepolo, Boucher, Fragonard, Johann Friedrich Overbeck, Hayez and Delacroix.

== Translations==
During the Renaissance, the first (incomplete) translation of &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot; was brought out by Richard Carew (1594). A complete version by Edward Fairfax appeared under the title &quot;Godfrey of Bouillon&quot; in 1600. John Hoole&#x27;s version in heroic couplets followed in 1772, and Jeremiah Holmes Wiffen&#x27;s (in Spenserian stanzas) in 1821. There were several 20th- and 21st-century versions, including by Anthony Esolen (2000) and by Max Wickert, published as &quot;The Liberation of Jerusalem&quot; by Oxford University Press (2009). &quot;Aminta&quot;, also his early love poems, as &quot;Love Poems for Lucrezia Bendidio&quot;, ed. and trans. by Max Wickert. New York: Italica Press, 2011, and as &quot;Rhymes of Love&quot;, ed. M.H. and S. Acocella, trans. by Maria Pastore Passaro (Ottawa: Legas, 2011). Several of the &quot;Dialogues&quot;, &quot;Torrismondo,&quot; and some of the late religious works have also been issued in English.

Translation in most European languages: in German by Gries (1st edition 1800), Streckfuss (1822) and Duttenhofer (1840), in French by, among others, Baour-Lormian (best edition 1819) and Philippon de la Madeleine (1841), in English, among others, by Hunt (1819) and Wiffen (1825), in Swedish by Carl Anders Kullberg (1860), in Danish by Christine Daugaard (1884, abridged)

==Legacy==
Tasso is commemorated by monuments in Bergamo and Sorrento. There are streets named after him in virtually every major Italian city, most notably in Bergamo, Posillipo (Naples), Rome, Turin, Palermo and Catania, as well as in Paris and Palo Alto, California.

<doc id="48230" wikidata="Q211171" url="?curid=48230" title="Polychlorinated biphenyl">
<text>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are organochlorine compounds with the formula C12H10−&quot;x&quot;Cl&quot;x&quot;; they were once widely used in the manufacture of carbonless copy paper, as heat transfer fluids, and as dielectric and coolant fluids for electrical equipment. They are highly toxic and carcinogenic chemical compounds, formerly used in industrial and consumer electronic products, whose production was banned internationally by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2001.

Because of their longevity, PCBs are still widely in use, even though their manufacture has declined drastically since the 1960s, when a host of problems were identified. With the discovery of PCBs&#x27; environmental toxicity, and classification as persistent organic pollutants, their production was banned for most uses by United States federal law on January 1, 1978.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) rendered PCBs as definite carcinogens in humans. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), PCBs cause cancer in animals and are probable human carcinogens. Moreover, because of their use as a coolant in electric transformers, PCBs still persist in built environments.

Some PCBs share a structural similarity and toxic mode of action with dioxins. Other toxic effects such as endocrine disruption (notably blocking of thyroid system functioning) and neurotoxicity are known. The bromine analogues of PCBs are polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), which have analogous applications and environmental concerns.

An estimated 1.2 million tons have been produced globally. Though the US EPA enforced the federal ban as of 1978, PCBs continued to create health problems in later years through their continued presence in soil and sediment, and from products which were made before 1979. In 1988, Japanese scientists Tanabe et al. estimated 370,000 tons were in the environment globally, and 780,000 tons were present in products, landfills, and dumps or kept in storage.

==Physical and chemical properties==
===Physical properties===
The compounds are pale-yellow viscous liquids. They are hydrophobic, with low water solubilities: 0.0027–0.42 ng/L for Aroclors brand, but they have high solubilities in most organic solvents, oils, and fats. They have low vapor pressures at room temperature. They have dielectric constants of 2.5–2.7, very high thermal conductivity, and high flash points (from 170 to 380 °C).

The density varies from 1.182 to 1.566 g/cm3. Other physical and chemical properties vary widely across the class. As the degree of chlorination increases, melting point and lipophilicity increase, and vapour pressure and water solubility decrease.

PCBs do not easily break down or degrade, which made them attractive for industries. PCB mixtures are resistant to acids, bases, oxidation, hydrolysis, and temperature change. They can generate extremely toxic dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans through partial oxidation. Intentional degradation as a treatment of unwanted PCBs generally requires high heat or catalysis (see Methods of destruction below).

PCBs readily penetrate skin, PVC (polyvinyl chloride), and latex (natural rubber). PCB-resistant materials include Viton, polyethylene, polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), butyl rubber, nitrile rubber, and Neoprene.

===Structure and toxicity===
PCBs are derived from biphenyl, which has the formula C12H10, sometimes written (C6H5)2. In PCBs, some of the hydrogen atoms in biphenyl are replaced by chlorine atoms. There are 209 different chemical compounds in which one to ten chlorine atoms can replace hydrogen atoms. PCBs are typically used as mixtures of compounds and are given the single identifying CAS number . About 130 different individual PCBs are found in commercial PCB products.

Toxic effects vary depending on the specific PCB. In terms of their structure and toxicity, PCBs fall into two distinct categories, referred to as coplanar or non-&quot;ortho&quot;-substituted arene substitution patterns and noncoplanar or &quot;ortho&quot;-substituted congeners.
;Coplanar or non-&quot;ortho&quot;
:The coplanar group members have a fairly rigid structure, with their two phenyl rings in the same plane. It renders their structure similar to polychlorinated dibenzo-&quot;p&quot;-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans, and allows them to act like PCDDs, as an agonist of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in organisms. They are considered as contributors to overall dioxin toxicity, and the term dioxins and dioxin-like compounds is often used interchangeably when the environmental and toxic impact of these compounds is considered.

;Noncoplanar
:Noncoplanar PCBs, with chlorine atoms at the &quot;ortho&quot; positions can cause neurotoxic and immunotoxic effects, but only at concentrations much higher than those normally associated with dioxins. However, as they are typically found at much higher levels in biological and environmental samples they also pose health concerns, particularly to developing animals (including humans). As they do not activate the AhR, they are not considered part of the dioxin group. Because of their lower overt toxicity, they have typically been of lesser concern to regulatory bodies.

Di-&quot;ortho&quot;-substituted, non-coplanar PCBs interfere with intracellular signal transduction dependent on calcium which may lead to neurotoxicity. &quot;ortho&quot;-PCBs can disrupt thyroid hormone transport by binding to transthyretin.

*Therminol FR Series (Monsanto ceased production in 1971).
===Aroclor mixtures ===
The only North American producer, Monsanto Company, marketed PCBs under the trade name Aroclor from 1930 to 1977. These were sold under trade names followed by a four-digit number. In general, the first two digits refer to the product series as designated by Monsanto (e.g. 1200 or 1100 series); the second two numbers indicate the percentage of chlorine by mass in the mixture. Thus, Aroclor 1260 is a 1200 series product and contains 60% chlorine by mass. It is a myth that the first two digits referred to the number of carbon atoms; the number of carbon atoms do not change in PCBs. The 1100 series was a crude PCB material which was distilled to create the 1200 series PCB product.

The exception to the naming system is Aroclor 1016 which was produced by distilling 1242 to remove the highly chlorinated congeners to make a more biodegradable product. &quot;1016&quot; was given to this product during Monsanto&#x27;s research stage for tracking purposes but the name stuck after it was commercialized.

Different Aroclors were used at different times and for different applications. In electrical equipment manufacturing in the US, Aroclor 1260 and Aroclor 1254 were the main mixtures used before 1950; Aroclor 1242 was the main mixture used in the 1950s and 1960s until it was phased out in 1971 and replaced by Aroclor 1016.

==Production==
One estimate (2006) suggested that 1 million tonnes of PCBs had been produced. 40% of this material was thought to remain in use. Another estimate put the total global production of PCBs on the order of 1.5 million tonnes. The United States was the single largest producer with over 600,000 tonnes produced between 1930 and 1977. The European region follows with nearly 450,000 tonnes through 1984. It is unlikely that a full inventory of global PCB production will ever be accurately tallied, as there were factories in Poland, East Germany, and Austria that produced unknown amounts of PCBs. , there were still 21,500 tons of PCBs stored in the easternmost regions of Slovakia.

Although deliberate production of PCBs is banned by international treaty, significant amounts of PCBs are still being &quot;inadvertently&quot; produced. Research suggests that 45,000 tons of &#x27;by-product&#x27; PCBs are legally produced per year in the US as part of certain chemical and product formulations.

Commercial production of PCBs was banned in the United States in 1979, with the passage of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).

==Applications==
The utility of PCBs is based largely on their chemical stability, including low flammability and high dielectric constant. In an electric arc, PCBs generate incombustible gases.

Use of PCBs is commonly divided into closed and open applications. Examples of closed applications include coolants and insulating fluids (transformer oil) for transformers and capacitors, such as those used in old fluorescent light ballasts, and hydraulic fluids considered a semi-closed application. In contrast, the major open application of PCBs was in carbonless copy (&quot;NCR&quot;) paper, which even presently results in paper contamination.

Other open applications were lubricating and cutting oils, and as plasticizers in paints and cements, stabilizing additives in flexible PVC coatings of electrical cables and electronic components, pesticide extenders, reactive flame retardants and sealants for caulking, adhesives, wood floor finishes, such as &quot;Fabulon&quot; and other products of Halowax in the U.S., de-dusting agents, waterproofing compounds, casting agents. It was also used as a plasticizer in paints and especially &quot;coal tars&quot; that were used widely to coat water tanks, bridges and other infrastructure pieces.

Modern sources include pigments, which may be used in inks for paper or plastic products. PCBs are also still found in old equipment like capacitors, ballasts, X-ray machine, and other e-waste.

==Environmental transport and transformations==
PCBs have entered the environment through both use and disposal. The environmental fate of PCBs is complex and global in scale.

===Water===
Because of their low vapour pressure, PCBs accumulate primarily in the hydrosphere, despite their hydrophobicity, in the organic fraction of soil, and in organisms including the human body. The hydrosphere is the main reservoir. The immense volume of water in the oceans is still capable of dissolving a significant quantity of PCBs.

As the pressure of ocean water increases with depth, PCBs become heavier than water and sink to the deepest ocean trenches where they are concentrated.

===Air===
A small volume of PCBs has been detected throughout the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The atmosphere serves as the primary route for global transport of PCBs, particularly for those congeners with one to four chlorine atoms.

In the atmosphere, PCBs may be degraded by hydroxyl radicals, or directly by photolysis of carbon–chlorine bonds (even if this is a less important process).

Atmospheric concentrations of PCBs tend to be lowest in rural areas, where they are typically in the picogram per cubic meter range, higher in suburban and urban areas, and highest in city centres, where they can reach 1 ng/m3 or more. In Milwaukee, an atmospheric concentration of 1.9 ng/m3 has been measured, and this source alone was estimated to account for 120 kg/year of PCBs entering Lake Michigan. In 2008, concentrations as high as 35 ng/m3, 10 times higher than the EPA guideline limit of 3.4 ng/m3, have been documented inside some houses in the U.S.

Volatilization of PCBs in soil was thought to be the primary source of PCBs in the atmosphere, but research suggests ventilation of PCB-contaminated indoor air from buildings is the primary source of PCB contamination in the atmosphere.

===Biosphere===
In the biosphere, PCBs can be degraded by the sun, bacteria or eukaryotes, but the speed of the reaction depends on both the number and the disposition of chlorine atoms in the molecule: less substituted, &quot;meta&quot;- or &quot;para&quot;-substituted PCBs undergo biodegradation faster than more substituted congeners.

In bacteria, PCBs may be dechlorinated through reductive dechlorination, or oxidized by dioxygenase enzyme. In eukaryotes, PCBs may be oxidized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme.

Like many lipophilic toxins, PCBs undergo biomagnification and bioaccumulation primarily due to the fact that they are easily retained within organisms.

Plastic pollution, specifically microplastics, are a major contributor of PCBs into the biosphere and especially into marine environments. PCBs concentrate in marine environments because freshwater systems, like rivers, act as a bridge for plastic pollution to be transported from terrestrial environments into marine environments. It has been estimated that 88–95% of marine plastic is exported into the ocean by just 10 major rivers.

An organism can accumulate PCBs by consuming other organisms that have previously ingested PCBs from terrestrial, freshwater, or marine environments. The concentration of PCBs within an organism will increase over their lifetime; this process is called bioaccumulation. PCB concentrations within an organism also change depending upon which trophic level they occupy. When an organism occupies a high trophic level, like orcas or humans, they will accumulate more PCBs than an organism that occupies a low trophic level, like phytoplankton. If enough organisms with a trophic level are killed due to the accumulation of toxins, like PCB, a trophic cascade can occur.

PCBs can cause harm to human health or even death when eaten. PCBs can be transported by birds from aquatic sources onto land via feces and carcasses.

==Biochemical metabolism==
===Overview===
PCBs undergo xenobiotic biotransformation, a mechanism used to make lipophilic toxins more polar and more easily excreted from the body. The biotransformation is dependent on the number of chlorine atoms present, along with their position on the rings. Phase I reactions occur by adding an oxygen to either of the benzene rings by Cytochrome P450. The type of P450 present also determines where the oxygen will be added; phenobarbital (PB)-induced P450s catalyze oxygenation to the meta-para positions of PCBs while 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC)-induced P450s add oxygens to the &quot;ortho&quot;–&quot;meta&quot; positions. PCBs containing &quot;ortho&quot;–&quot;meta&quot; and &quot;meta&quot;–&quot;para&quot; protons can be metabolized by either enzyme, making them the most likely to leave the organism. However, some metabolites of PCBs containing &quot;ortho&quot;–&quot;meta&quot; protons have increased steric hindrance from the oxygen, causing increased stability and an increased chance of accumulation.

===Species dependent===
Metabolism is also dependent on the species of organism; different organisms have slightly different P450 enzymes that metabolize certain PCBs better than others. Looking at the PCB metabolism in the liver of four sea turtle species (green, olive ridley, loggerhead and hawksbill), green and hawksbill sea turtles have noticeably higher hydroxylation rates of PCB 52 than olive ridley or loggerhead sea turtles. This is because the green and hawksbill sea turtles have higher P450 2-like protein expression. This protein adds three hydroxyl groups to PCB 52, making it more polar and water-soluble. P450 3-like protein expression that is thought to be linked to PCB 77 metabolism, something that was not measured in this study.

===Temperature dependent===
Temperature plays a key role in the ecology, physiology and metabolism of aquatic species. The rate of PCB metabolism was temperature dependent in yellow perch (&quot;Perca flavescens&quot;). In fall and winter, only 11 out of 72 introduced PCB congeners were excreted and had halflives of more than 1,000 days. During spring and summer when the average daily water temperature was above 20 °C, persistent PCBs had halflives of 67 days. The main excretion processes were fecal egestion, growth dilution and loss across respiratory surfaces. The excretion rate of PCBs matched with the perch&#x27;s natural bioenergetics, where most of their consumption, respiration and growth rates occur during the late spring and summer. Since the perch is performing more functions in the warmer months, it naturally has a faster metabolism and has less PCB accumulation. However, multiple cold-water periods mixed with toxic PCBs with coplanar chlorine molecules can be detrimental to perch health.

===Sex dependent===
Enantiomers of chiral compounds have similar chemical and physical properties, but can be metabolized by the body differently. This was looked at in bowhead whales (&quot;Balaena mysticetus&quot;) for two main reasons: they are large animals with slow metabolisms (meaning PCBs will accumulate in fatty tissue) and few studies have measured chiral PCBs in cetaceans. They found that the average PCB concentrations in the blubber were approximately four times higher than the liver; however, this result is most likely age- and sex-dependent. As reproductively active females transferred PCBs and other poisonous substances to the fetus, the PCB concentrations in the blubber were significantly lower than males of the same body length (less than 13 meters).

==Health effects==
The toxicity of PCBs varies considerably among congeners. The coplanar PCBs, known as nonortho PCBs because they are not substituted at the ring positions &quot;ortho&quot; to (next to) the other ring, (such as PCBs 77, 126 and 169), tend to have dioxin-like properties, and generally are among the most toxic congeners. Because PCBs are almost invariably found in complex mixtures, the concept of toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) has been developed to facilitate risk assessment and regulation, where more toxic PCB congeners are assigned higher TEF values on a scale from 0 to 1. One of the most toxic compounds known, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo[p]dioxin, a PCDD, is assigned a TEF of 1. In June 2020, State Impact of Pennsylvania stated that &quot;In 1979, the EPA banned the use of PCBs, but they still exist in some products produced before 1979. They persist in the environment because they bind to sediments and soils. High exposure to PCBs can cause birth defects, developmental delays, and liver changes.&quot;

===Exposure and excretion===
In general, people are exposed to PCBs overwhelmingly through food, much less so by breathing contaminated air, and least by skin contact. Once exposed, some PCBs may change to other chemicals inside the body. These chemicals or unchanged PCBs can be excreted in feces or may remain in a person&#x27;s body for years, with half lives estimated at 10–15 years. PCBs collect in body fat and milk fat. PCBs biomagnify up the food web and are present in fish and overflow of contaminated aquifers. Human infants are exposed to PCBs through breast milk or by intrauterine exposure through transplacental transfer of PCBs and are at the top of the food chain.

Workers recycling old equipment in the electronics recycling industry can also be exposed to PCBs.

===Signs and symptoms===
====Humans====
The most commonly observed health effects in people exposed to extremely high levels of PCBs are skin conditions, such as chloracne and rashes, but these were known to be symptoms of acute systemic poisoning dating back to 1922. Studies in workers exposed to PCBs have shown changes in blood and urine that may indicate liver damage. In Japan in 1968, 280 kg of PCB-contaminated rice bran oil was used as chicken feed, resulting in a mass poisoning, known as Yushō disease, in over 1800 people. Common symptoms included dermal and ocular lesions, irregular menstrual cycles and lowered immune responses. Other symptoms included fatigue, headaches, coughs, and unusual skin sores. Additionally, in children, there were reports of poor cognitive development. Women exposed to PCBs before or during pregnancy can give birth to children with lowered cognitive ability, compromised immune systems, and motor control problems.

There is evidence that crash dieters that have been exposed to PCBs have an elevated risk of health complications. Stored PCBs in the adipose tissue become mobilized into the blood when individuals begin to crash diet.

PCBs have shown toxic and mutagenic effects by interfering with hormones in the body. PCBs, depending on the specific congener, have been shown to both inhibit and imitate estradiol, the main sex hormone in females. Imitation of the estrogen compound can feed estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells, and possibly cause other cancers, such as uterine or cervical. Inhibition of estradiol can lead to serious developmental problems for both males and females, including sexual, skeletal, and mental development issues. In a cross-sectional study, PCBs were found to be negatively associated with testosterone levels in adolescent boys.

High PCB levels in adults have been shown to result in reduced levels of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine, which affects almost every physiological process in the body, including growth and development, metabolism, body temperature, and heart rate. It also resulted in reduced immunity and increased thyroid disorders.

====Animals====
Animals that eat PCB-contaminated food, even for short periods of time, suffer liver damage and may die. In 1968 in Japan, 400,000 birds died after eating poultry feed that was contaminated with PCBs. Animals that ingest smaller amounts of PCBs in food over several weeks or months develop various health effects, including anemia; acne-like skin conditions (chloracne); liver, stomach, and thyroid gland injuries (including hepatocarcinoma), and thymocyte apoptosis. Other effects of PCBs in animals include changes in the immune system, behavioral alterations, and impaired reproduction. PCBs that have dioxin-like activity are known to cause a variety of teratogenic effects in animals. Exposure to PCBs causes hearing loss and symptoms similar to hypothyroidism in rats.

===Cancer===
In 2013, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified dioxin-like PCBs as human carcinogens.
According to the U.S. EPA, PCBs have been shown to cause cancer in animals and evidence supports a cancer-causing effect in humans. Per the EPA, studies have found increases in malignant melanoma and rare liver cancers in PCB workers.

In 2013, the IARC determined that the evidence for PCBs causing non-Hodgkin lymphoma is &quot;limited&quot; and &quot;not consistent&quot;. In contrast an association between elevated blood levels of PCBs and non-Hodgkin lymphoma had been previously accepted. PCBs may play a role in the development of cancers of the immune system because some tests of laboratory animals subjected to very high doses of PCBs have shown effects on the animals&#x27; immune system, and some studies of human populations have reported an association between environmental levels of PCBs and immune response.

===Lawsuits related to health effects===

In the early 1990s, Monsanto faced several lawsuits over harm caused by PCBs from workers at companies such as Westinghouse that bought PCBs from Monsanto and used them to build electrical equipment. Monsanto and its customers, such as Westinghouse and GE, also faced litigation from third parties, such as workers at scrap yards that bought used electrical equipment and broke them down to reclaim valuable metals. Monsanto settled some of these cases and won the others, on the grounds that it had clearly told its customers that PCBs were dangerous chemicals and that protective procedures needed to be implemented.

In 2003, Monsanto and Solutia Inc., a Monsanto corporate spin-off, reached a $700 million settlement with the residents of West Anniston, Alabama, who had been affected by the manufacturing and dumping of PCBs. In a trial lasting six weeks, the jury found that &quot;Monsanto had engaged in outrageous behavior, and held the corporations and its corporate successors liable on all six counts it considered – including negligence, nuisance, wantonness and suppression of the truth.&quot;

In 2014, the Los Angeles Superior Court found that Monsanto was not liable for cancers claimed to be from PCBs permeating the food supply of three plaintiffs who had developed non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma. After a four-week trial, the jury found that Monsanto&#x27;s production and sale of PCBs between 1935 and 1977 were not substantial causes of the cancer.

In 2015, the cities of Spokane, San Diego, and San Jose initiated lawsuits against Monsanto to recover cleanup costs for PCB contaminated sites, alleging that Monsanto continued to sell PCBs without adequate warnings after they knew of their toxicity. Monsanto issued a media statement concerning the San Diego case, claiming that improper use or disposal by third-parties, of a lawfully sold product, was not the company&#x27;s responsibility.

In July 2015, a St Louis county court in Missouri found that Monsanto, Solutia, Pharmacia and Pfizer were not liable for a series of deaths and injuries caused by PCBs manufactured by Monsanto Chemical Company until 1977. The trial took nearly a month and the jury took a day of deliberations to return a verdict against the plaintiffs from throughout the USA. Similar cases are ongoing. &quot;The evidence simply doesn&#x27;t support the assertion that the historic use of PCB products was the cause of the plaintiffs&#x27; harms. We are confident that the jury will conclude, as two other juries have found in similar cases, that the former Monsanto Company is not responsible for the alleged injuries,&quot; a Monsanto statement said.

In May 2016, a Missouri state jury ordered Monsanto to pay $46.5 million to three plaintiffs whose exposure to PCB caused non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

In December 2016, the state of Washington filed suit in King County. The state sought damages and clean up costs related to PCBs. In March 2018 Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine also filed a lawsuit against Monsanto over health issues posed by PCBs.

On November 21, 2019, a federal judge denied a bid by Monsanto to dismiss a lawsuit filed by LA County calling the company to clean up cancer-causing PCBs from Los Angeles County waterways and storm sewer pipelines. The lawsuit calls for Monsanto to pay for cleanup of PCBs from dozens of waterways, including the LA River, San Gabriel River and the Dominguez Watershed.

In June 2020, Bayer agreed to pay $650 million to settle local lawsuits related to Monsanto&#x27;s pollution of public waters in various areas of the United States with PCBs.

In 2023, over 90 Vermont school districts joined a lawsuit against Monsanto alleging that PCBs created by the company were used in the construction of their schools. The Vermont Attorney General&#x27;s office also filed its own lawsuit against Monsanto related to the use of its PCBs.

==History==

In 1865, the first &quot;PCB-like&quot; chemical was discovered, and was found to be a byproduct of coal tar. Years later in 1876, German chemist Oscar Döbner (Doebner) synthesized the first PCB in a laboratory. Since then, large amounts of PCBs were released into the environment, to the extent that there are even measurable amounts of PCBs in feathers of birds currently held in museums before the production of PCBs peaked.

In 1935, Monsanto Chemical Company (later Solutia Inc) took over commercial production of PCBs from Swann Chemical Company which had begun in 1929. PCBs, originally termed &quot;chlorinated diphenyls&quot;, were commercially produced as mixtures of isomers at different degrees of chlorination. The electric industry used PCBs as a non-flammable replacement for mineral oil to cool and insulate industrial transformers and capacitors. PCBs were also commonly used as heat stabilizer in cables and electronic components to enhance the heat and fire resistance of PVC.

In the 1930s, the toxicity associated with PCBs and other chlorinated hydrocarbons, including polychlorinated naphthalenes, was recognized because of a variety of industrial incidents. Between 1936 and 1937, there were several medical cases and papers released on the possible link between PCBs and its detrimental health effects. In 1936, a U.S. Public health Service official described the wife and child of a worker from the Monsanto Industrial Chemical Company who exhibited blackheads and pustules on their skin. The official attributed these symptoms to contact with the worker&#x27;s clothing after he returned from work. In 1937, a conference about the hazards was organized at Harvard School of Public Health, and a number of publications referring to the toxicity of various chlorinated hydrocarbons were published before 1940.

In 1947, Robert Brown reminded chemists that Arochlors were &quot;objectionably toxic&quot;: &quot;Thus the maximum permissible concentration for an 8-hr. day is 1 mg. per cu.m. [] of air. They also produce a serious and disfiguring dermatitis&quot;.

In 1954, Kanegafuchi Chemical Co. Ltd. (Kaneka Corporation) first produced PCBs, and continued until 1972.

Through the 1960s Monsanto Chemical Company knew increasingly more about PCBs&#x27; harmful effects on humans and the environment, per internal leaked documents released in 2002, yet PCB manufacture and use continued with few restraints until the 1970s.

In 1966, PCBs were determined by Swedish chemist Sören Jensen to be an environmental contaminant. Jensen, according to a 1994 article in &quot;Sierra&quot;, named chemicals PCBs, which previously, had simply been called &quot;phenols&quot; or referred to by various trade names, such as Aroclor, Kanechlor, Pyrenol, Chlorinol and others. In 1972, PCB production plants existed in Austria, West Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Japan, Spain, the USSR and the US.

In the early 1970s, Ward B. Stone of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) first published his findings that PCBs were leaking from transformers and had contaminated the soil at the bottom of utility poles.

There have been allegations that Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories engaged in data falsification in testing relating to PCBs. In 2003, Monsanto and Solutia Inc., a Monsanto corporate spinoff, reached a US$700 million settlement with the residents of West Anniston, Alabama, who had been affected by the manufacturing and dumping of PCBs. In a trial lasting six weeks, the jury found that &quot;Monsanto had engaged in outrageous behavior, and held the corporations and its corporate successors liable on all six counts it considered – including negligence, nuisance, wantonness and suppression of the truth.&quot;

Existing products containing PCBs which are &quot;totally enclosed uses&quot; such as insulating fluids in transformers and capacitors, vacuum pump fluids, and hydraulic fluid, are allowed to remain in use in the US. The public, legal, and scientific concerns about PCBs arose from research indicating they are likely carcinogens having the potential to adversely impact the environment and, therefore, undesirable as commercial products. Despite active research spanning five decades, extensive regulatory actions, and an effective ban on their production since the 1970s, PCBs still persist in the environment and remain a focus of attention.

==Pollution due to PCBs==
===Belgium===
In 1999, the Dioxin Affair occurred when 50 kg of PCB transformer oils were added to a stock of recycled fat used for the production of 500 tonnes of animal feed, eventually affecting around 2,500 farms in several countries. The name &quot;Dioxin Affair&quot; was coined from early misdiagnosis of dioxins as the primary contaminants, when in fact they turned out to be a relatively small part of the contamination caused by thermal reactions of PCBs. The PCB congener pattern suggested the contamination was from a mixture of Aroclor 1260 and 1254. Over 9 million chickens, and 60,000 pigs were destroyed because of the contamination. The extent of human health effects has been debated, in part because of the use of differing risk assessment methods. One group predicted increased cancer rates, and increased rates of neurological problems in those exposed as neonates. A second study suggested carcinogenic effects were unlikely and that the primary risk would be associated with developmental effects due to exposure in pregnancy and neonates. Two businessmen who knowingly sold the contaminated feed ingredient received two-year suspended sentences for their role in the crisis.

===Italy===
The Italian company Caffaro, located in Brescia, specialized in producing PCBs from 1938 to 1984, following the acquisition of the exclusive rights to use the patent in Italy from Monsanto. The pollution resulting from this factory and the case of Anniston, in the US, are the largest known cases in the world of PCB contamination in water and soil, in terms of the amount of toxic substance dispersed, size of the area contaminated, number of people involved and duration of production.

The values reported by the local health authority (ASL) of Brescia since 1999 are 5,000 times above the limits set by Ministerial Decree 471/1999 (levels for residential areas, 0.001 mg/kg). As a result of this and other investigations, in June 2001, a complaint of an environmental disaster was presented to the Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office of Brescia. Research on the adult population of Brescia showed that residents of some urban areas, former workers of the plant, and consumers of contaminated food, have PCB levels in their bodies that are in many cases 10–20 times higher than reference values in comparable general populations. PCBs entered the human food supply by animals grazing on contaminated pastures near the factory, especially in local veal mostly eaten by farmers&#x27; families. The exposed population showed an elevated risk of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but not for other specific cancers.

===Japan===
In 1968, a mixture of dioxins and PCBs got into rice bran oil produced in northern Kyushu. Contaminated cooking oil sickened more than 1,860 people. The symptoms were called Yushō disease.

In Okinawa, high levels of PCB contamination in soil on Kadena Air Base were reported in 1987 at thousands of parts per million, some of the highest levels found in any pollution site in the world.

===Republic of Ireland===

In December 2008, a number of Irish news sources reported testing had revealed &quot;extremely high&quot; levels of dioxins, by toxic equivalent, in pork products, ranging from 80 to 200 times the EU&#x27;s upper safe limit of 1.5 pg WHO-TEQDFP/μg i.e. 0.12 to 0.3 parts per billion.

Brendan Smith, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, stated the pork contamination was caused by PCB-contaminated feed that was used on 9 of Ireland&#x27;s 400 pig farms, and only one feed supplier was involved. Smith added that 38 beef farms also used the same contaminated feed, but those farms were quickly isolated and no contaminated beef entered the food chain. While the contamination was limited to just 9 pig farms, the Irish government requested the immediate withdrawal and disposal of all pork-containing products produced in Ireland and purchased since September 1, 2008. This request for withdrawal of pork products was confirmed in a press release by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on December 6.

It is thought that the incident resulted from the contamination of fuel oil used in a drying burner at a single feed processor, with PCBs. The resulting combustion produced a highly toxic mixture of PCBs, dioxins and furans, which was included in the feed produced and subsequently fed to a large number of pigs.

===Kenya===
In Kenya, a number of cases have been reported in the 2010s of thieves selling transformer oil, stolen from electric transformers, to the operators of roadside food stalls for use in deep frying. When used for frying, it is reported that transformer oil lasts much longer than regular cooking oil. The downside of this misuse of the transformer oil is the threat to the health of the consumers, due to the presence of PCBs.

===Slovakia===
The chemical plant Chemko in Strážske (east Slovakia) was an important producer of polychlorinated biphenyls for the former communist bloc (Comecon) until 1984. Chemko contaminated a large part of east Slovakia, especially the sediments of the Laborec river and reservoir Zemplínska šírava.

===Slovenia===
Between 1962 and 1983, the Iskra Kondenzatorji company in Semič (White Carniola, Southeast Slovenia) manufactured capacitors using PCBs. Due to the wastewater and improperly disposed waste products, the area (including the Krupa and Lahinja rivers) became highly contaminated with PCBs. The pollution was discovered in 1983, when the Krupa river was meant to become a water supply source. The area was sanitized then, but the soil and water are still highly polluted. Traces of PCBs were found in food (eggs, cow milk, walnuts) and Krupa is still the most PCB-polluted river in the world.

===Spain and Portugal===
Several cetacean species have very high mean blubber PCB concentrations likely to cause population declines and suppress population recovery. Striped dolphins, bottlenose dolphins and orcas were found to have mean levels that markedly exceeded all known marine mammal PCB toxicity thresholds. The western Mediterranean Sea and the south-west Iberian Peninsula were identified as &quot;hotspots&quot;.

===United Kingdom===
Monsanto manufactured PCBs at its chemical plant in Newport, South Wales, until the mid- to late-1970s. During this period, waste matter, including PCBs, from the Newport site was dumped at a disused quarry near Groes-faen, west of Cardiff, and Penhros landfill site from where it continues to be released in waste water discharges.

===United States===
Monsanto was the only company that manufactured PCBs in the US. Its production was entirely halted in 1977. (Kimbrough, 1987, 1995) On November 25, 2020, U.S. District Judge Fernando M. Olguin rejected a proposed $650 million settlement from Bayer, the company which acquired Monsanto in 2018, and allowed Monsanto-related lawsuits involving PCB to proceed.

====Alabama====
PCBs originating from Monsanto Chemical Company in Anniston, Alabama, were dumped into Snow Creek, which then spread to Choccolocco Creek, then Logan Martin Lake. In the early 2000s, class action lawsuits were settled by local land owners, including those on Logan Martin Lake, and Lay Reservoir (downstream on the Coosa River), for the PCB pollution. Donald Stewart, former Senator from Alabama, first learned of the concerns of hundreds of west Anniston residents after representing a church which had been approached about selling its property by Monsanto. Stewart went on to be the pioneer and lead attorney in the first and majority of cases against Monsanto and focused on residents in the immediate area known to be most polluted. Other attorneys later joined in to file suits for those outside the main immediate area around the plant; one of these was the late Johnnie Cochran.

In 2007, the highest pollution levels remained concentrated in Snow and Choccolocco Creeks. Concentrations in fish have declined and continue to decline over time; sediment disturbance, however, can resuspend the PCBs from the sediment back into the water column and food web.

====California====

San Francisco Bay has been contaminated by PCBs, &quot;a legacy of PCBs spread widely across the land surface of the watershed, mixed deep into the sediment of the Bay, and contaminating the Bay food web&quot;. Levels of PCBs in fish and shellfish exceed thresholds for safe consumption. Signs around the Bay warn anglers of which species to avoid. State water quality regulators set a Total Maximum Daily Load for PCBs require city and county governments around the Bay to implement control measures to limit PCBs in urban runoff. An important part of the second, revised version of this permit was the requirement for municipalities to install green infrastructure with a goal of reducing pollutant levels in stormwater.

====Connecticut====
In New Haven, the decommissioned English Station has a high concentration of PCB contamination due to the chemicals used in the running of the plant. This, along with asbestos contamination, has made cleaning and demolishing the abandoned site extremely difficult. The PCB contamination has spread to the soil, and to the river, where locals will sometimes fish unaware of the danger.

====Great Lakes====
In 1976, environmentalists found PCBs in the sludge at Waukegan Harbor, the southwest end of Lake Michigan. They were able to trace the source of the PCBs back to the Outboard Marine Corporation that was producing boat motors next to the harbor. By 1982, the Outboard Marine Corporation was court-ordered to release quantitative data referring to their PCB waste released. The data stated that from 1954 they released 100,000 tons of PCB into the environment, and that the sludge contained PCBs in concentrations as high as 50%.

In 1989, during construction near the Zilwaukee bridge, workers uncovered an uncharted landfill containing PCB-contaminated waste which cost $100,000 to clean up.

Much of the Great Lakes area were still heavily polluted with PCBs in 1988, despite extensive remediation work.

====Indiana====
From the late 1950s through 1977, Westinghouse Electric used PCBs in the manufacture of capacitors in its Bloomington, Indiana, plant. Reject capacitors were hauled and dumped in area salvage yards and landfills, including Bennett&#x27;s Dump, Neal&#x27;s Landfill and Lemon Lane Landfill. Workers also dumped PCB oil down factory drains, which contaminated the city sewage treatment plant. The City of Bloomington gave away the sludge to area farmers and gardeners, creating anywhere from 200 to 2,000 sites, which remain unaddressed.

Over 1,000 tons of PCBs were estimated to have been dumped in Monroe and Owen counties. Although federal and state authorities have been working on the sites&#x27; environmental remediation, many areas remain contaminated. Concerns have been raised regarding the removal of PCBs from the karst limestone topography, and regarding the possible disposal options. To date, the Westinghouse Bloomington PCB Superfund site case does not have a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) and Record of Decision (ROD), although Westinghouse signed a US Department of Justice Consent Decree in 1985. The 1985 consent decree required Westinghouse to construct an incinerator that would incinerate PCB-contaminated materials. Because of public opposition to the incinerator, however, the State of Indiana passed a number of laws that delayed and blocked its construction. The parties to the consent decree began to explore alternative remedies in 1994 for six of the main PCB contaminated sites in the consent decree. Hundreds of sites remain unaddressed as of 2014. Monroe County will never be PCB-free, as noted in a 2014 Indiana University program about the local contamination.

On February 15, 2008, Monroe County approved a plan to clean up the three remaining contaminated sites in the City of Bloomington, at a cost of $9.6 million to CBS Corp., the successor of Westinghouse. In 1999, Viacom bought CBS, so they are current responsible party for the PCB sites.

====Massachusetts====
Pittsfield, in western Massachusetts, was home to the General Electric (GE) transformer, capacitor, and electrical generating equipment divisions. The electrical generating division built and repaired equipment that was used to power the electrical utility grid throughout the nation. PCB-contaminated oil routinely migrated from GE&#x27;s industrial plant located in the very center of the city to the surrounding groundwater, nearby Silver Lake, and to the Housatonic River, which flows through Massachusetts, Connecticut, and down to Long Island Sound. PCB-containing solid material was widely used as fill, including oxbows of the Housatonic River. Fish and waterfowl which live in and around the river contain significant levels of PCBs and are not safe to eat. EPA designated the Pittsfield plant and several miles of the river as a Superfund site in 1997, and ordered GE to remediate the site. EPA and GE began a cleanup of the area in 1999.

New Bedford Harbor, which is a listed Superfund site, contained some of the highest sediment concentrations of PCBs in the marine environment. Cleanup of the area began in 1994 and is mostly complete as of 2020.

Investigations into historic waste dumping in the Bliss Corner neighborhood have revealed the existence of PCBs, among other hazardous materials, buried in soil and waste material.

====Missouri====
In 1982, Martha C. Rose Chemical Inc. began processing and disposing of materials contaminated with PCBs in Holden, Missouri, a small rural community about east of Kansas City. From 1982 until 1986, nearly 750 companies, including General Motors Corp., Commonwealth Edison, Illinois Power Co. and West Texas Utilities, sent millions of pounds of PCB contaminated materials to Holden for disposal. Instead, according to prosecutors, the company began storing the contaminated materials while falsifying its reports to the EPA to show they had been removed. After investigators learned of the deception, Rose Chemical was closed and filed for bankruptcy. The site had become the nation&#x27;s largest waste site for the chemical PCB. In the four years the company was operational, the EPA inspected it four times and assessed $206,000 in fines but managed to collect only $50,000.

After the plant closed the state environmental agency found PCB contamination in streams near the plant and in the city&#x27;s sewage treatment sludge. A 100,000 square-foot warehouse and unknown amounts of contaminated soil and water around the site had to be cleaned up. Most of the surface debris, including close to 13 million pounds of contaminated equipment, carcasses and tanks of contaminated oil, had to be removed. Walter C. Carolan, owner of Rose Chemical, and five others pleaded guilty in 1989 to committing fraud or falsifying documents. Carolan and two other executives served sentences of less than 18 months; the others received fines and were placed on probation. Cleanup costs at the site are estimated at $35 million.

====Montana====
Two launch facilities at Malmstrom Air Force Base showed PCB levels higher than the thresholds recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency when extensive sampling began of active U.S. intercontinental ballistic missile bases to address specific cancer concerns in 2023.

====New York====
Pollution of the Hudson River is largely due to dumping of PCBs by General Electric from 1947 to 1977. GE dumped an estimated 1.3 million pounds of PCBs into the Hudson River during these years. The PCBs came from the company&#x27;s two capacitor manufacturing plants at Hudson Falls and Fort Edward, New York. This pollution caused a range of harmful effects to wildlife and people who eat fish from the river or drink the water. In 1984, EPA declared a 200-mile (320 km) stretch of the river, from Hudson Falls to New York City, to be a Superfund site requiring cleanup. Extensive remediation actions on the river began in the 1970s with the implementation of wastewater discharge permits and consequent control or reduction of wastewater discharges, and sediment removal operations, which have continued into the 21st century.

Love Canal is a neighborhood in Niagara Falls, New York, that was heavily contaminated with toxic waste including PCBs. Eighteen Mile Creek in Lockport, New York, is an EPA Superfund site for PCBs contamination.

PCB pollution at the State Office Building in Binghamton was responsible for what is now considered to be the first indoor environmental disaster in the United States. In 1981, a transformer explosion in the basement spewed PCBs throughout the entire 18-story building. The contamination was so severe that cleanup efforts kept the building closed for 13 years.

====North Carolina====
One of the largest deliberate PCB spills in American history occurred in the summer of 1978 when 31,000 gallons (117 m^3) of PCB-contaminated oil were illegally sprayed by the Ward PCB Transformer Company in swaths along the roadsides of some of North Carolina highway shoulders in 14 counties and at the Fort Bragg Army Base. The crime, known as &quot;the midnight dumpings&quot;, occurred over nearly two weeks, as drivers of a black-painted tanker truck drove down one side of rural Piedmont highways spraying PCB-laden waste and then up the other side the following night.

Under Governor James B. Hunt, Jr., state officials then erected large, yellow warning signs along the contaminated highways that read: &quot;CAUTION: PCB Chemical Spills Along Highway Shoulders&quot;. The illegal dumping is believed to have been motivated by the passing of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which became effective on August 2, 1978, and increased the expense of chemical waste disposal.

Within a couple of weeks of the crime, Robert Burns and his sons, Timothy and Randall, were arrested for dumping the PCBs along the roadsides. Burns was a business partner of Robert &quot;Buck&quot; Ward Jr., of the Ward PCB Transformer Company, in Raleigh. Burns and sons pleaded guilty to state and Federal criminal charges; Burns received a three to five-year prison sentence. Ward was acquitted of state charges in the dumping, but was sentenced to 18 months prison time for violation of TSCA.

Cleanup and disposal of the roadside PCBs generated controversy, as the Governor&#x27;s plan to pick up the roadside PCBs and to bury them in a landfill in rural Warren County were strongly opposed in 1982 by local residents.

In October 2013, at the request of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC), the City of Charlotte, North Carolina, decided to stop applying sewage sludge to land while authorities investigated the source of PCB contamination.
In February 2014, the City of Charlotte admitted PCBs have entered their sewage treatment centers as well.

After the 2013 SCDHEC had issued emergency regulations, the City of Charlotte discovered high levels of PCBs entering its sewage waste water treatment plants, where sewage is converted to sewage sludge. The city at first denied it had a problem, then admitted an &quot;event&quot; occurred in February 2014, and in April that the problem had occurred much earlier. The city stated that its very first test with a newly changed test method revealed very high PCB levels in its sewage sludge farm field fertilizer. Because of the widespread use of the contaminated sludge, SCDHEC subsequently issued PCB fish advisories for nearly all streams and rivers bordering farm fields that had been applied with city waste.

====Ohio====
The Clyde cancer cluster (also known as the Sandusky County cancer cluster) is a childhood cancer cluster that has affected many families in Clyde, Ohio, and surrounding areas. PCBs were found in soil in a public park within the area of the cancer cluster.

In Akron, Ohio, soil was contaminated and noxious PCB-laden fumes had been put into the air by an electrical transformer deconstruction operation from the 1930s to the 1960s.

====South Carolina====
From 1955 until 1977, the Sangamo Weston plant in Pickens, South Carolina, used PCBs to manufacture capacitors, and dumped 400,000 pounds of PCB contaminated wastewater into the Twelve Mile Creek. In 1990, the EPA declared the site of the capacitor plant, its landfills and the polluted watershed, which stretches nearly downstream to Lake Hartwell as a Superfund site. Two dams on the Twelve Mile Creek are to be removed and on Feb. 22, 2011 the first of two dams began to be dismantled. Some contaminated sediment is being removed from the site and hauled away, while other sediment is pumped into a series of settling ponds.

In 2013, the state environmental regulators issued a rare emergency order, banning all sewage sludge from being land applied or deposited on landfills, as it contained very high levels of PCBs. The problem had not been discovered until thousands of acres of farm land in the state had been contaminated by the hazardous sludge. A criminal investigation to determine the perpetrator of this crime was launched.

====Washington====
As of 2015, several bodies of water in the state of Washington were contaminated with PCBs, including the Columbia River, the Duwamish River, Green Lake, Lake Washington, the Okanogan River, Puget Sound, the Spokane River, the Walla Walla River, the Wenatchee River, and the Yakima River. A study by Washington State published in 2011 found that the two largest sources of PCB flow into the Spokane River were City of Spokane stormwater (44%) and municipal and industrial discharges (20%).

PCBs entered the environment through paint, hydraulic fluids, sealants, inks and have been found in river sediment and wildlife. Spokane utilities will spend $300 million to prevent PCBs from entering the river in anticipation of a 2017 federal deadline to do so. In August 2015 Spokane joined other U.S. cities like San Diego and San Jose, California, and Westport, Massachusetts, in seeking damages from Monsanto.

====Wisconsin====
From 1954 until 1971, the Fox River in Appleton, Wisconsin, had PCBs deposited into it from Appleton Paper/NCR, P.H. Gladfelter, Georgia-Pacific and other notable local paper manufacturing facilities. The Wisconsin DNR estimates that after wastewater treatment the PCB discharges to the Fox River due to production losses ranged from 81,000 kg to 138,000 kg. (178,572 lbs. to 304,235 lbs). The production of Carbon Copy Paper and its byproducts led to the discharge into the river. Fox River clean up is ongoing.

=== Pacific Ocean ===
Polychlorinated biphenyls have been discovered in organisms living in the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean. Levels were as high as 1,900 nanograms per gram of amphipod tissue in the organisms analyzed.

==Regulation==
===Japan===
In 1972 the Japanese government banned the production, use, and import of PCBs.

===Sweden===
In 1973, the use of PCBs in &quot;open&quot; or &quot;dissipative&quot; sources (such as plasticisers in paints and cements, casting agents, fire retardant fabric treatments and heat stabilizing additives for PVC electrical insulation, adhesives, paints and waterproofing, railroad ties) was banned in Sweden.

===United Kingdom===
In 1981, the UK banned closed uses of PCBs in new equipment, and nearly all UK PCB synthesis ceased; closed uses in existing equipment containing in excess of 5 litres of PCBs were not stopped until December 2000.

===United States===
In 1976, concern over the toxicity and persistence (chemical stability) of PCBs in the environment led the United States Congress to ban their domestic production, effective January 1, 1978, pursuant to the Toxic Substances Control Act. To implement the law, EPA banned new manufacturing of PCBs, but issued regulations that allowed for their continued use in electrical equipment for economic reasons. EPA began issuing regulations for PCB usage and disposal in 1979. The agency has issued guidance publications for safe removal and disposal of PCBs from existing equipment.

EPA defined the &quot;maximum contaminant level goal&quot; for public water systems as zero, but because of the limitations of water treatment technologies, a level of 0.5 parts per billion is the actual regulated level (maximum contaminant level).

==Methods of destruction==
===Physical===
PCBs were technically attractive because of their inertness, which includes their resistance to combustion. Nonetheless, they can be effectively destroyed by incineration at 1000 °C. When combusted at lower temperatures, they convert in part to more hazardous unintentional persistent organic pollutants, including polychlorinated dibenzofurans and dibenzo-p-dioxins. When conducted properly, the combustion products are water, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen chloride. In some cases, the PCBs are combusted as a solution in kerosene. PCBs have also been destroyed by pyrolysis in the presence of alkali metal carbonates.

Thermal desorption is highly effective at removing PCBs from soil.

===Chemical===
PCBs are fairly chemically unreactive, this property being attractive for its application as an inert material. They resist oxidation.
Many chemical compounds are available to destroy or reduce the PCBs. Commonly, PCBs are degraded by basic mixtures of glycols, which displace some or all chloride. Also effective are reductants such as sodium or sodium naphthalene. Vitamin B12 has also shown promise.

===Microbial===
The use of microorganisms to degrade PCBs from contaminated sites, relying on multiple microorganisms&#x27; co-metabolism, is known as bioremediation of polychlorinated biphenyl. Some micro-organisms degrade PCBs by reducing the C-Cl bonds. Microbial dechlorination tends to be rather slow-acting in comparison to other methods. Enzymes extracted from microbes can show PCB activity. In 2005, &quot;Shewanella oneidensis&quot; biodegraded a high percentage of PCBs in soil samples. A low voltage current can stimulate the microbial degradation of PCBs.

===Fungal===
There is research showing that some ligninolytic fungi can degrade PCBs.

==Bioremediation==
The remediation, or removal, of PCBs from estuarian and coastal river sediments is quite difficult due to the overlying water column and the potential for resuspension of contaminants during the removal process. The most common method of PCB extraction from sediments is to dredge an area and dispose of the sediments in a landfill. This method is troubling for a number of reasons, namely that it has a risk of resuspension of the chemicals as the sediments are disturbed, and this method can be very damaging to ecosystems.

A potential cost effective, low risk remediation technique is bioremediation. Bioremediation involves the use of biota to remediate sediments. Phytoremediation, the use of plants to remediate soils, has been found to be effective for a broad range of contaminants such as mercury PCB and PAHs in terrestrial soils. A promising study conducted in New Bedford Harbor found that &quot;Ulva rigida&quot;, a type of seaweed common throughout the world, is effective at removing PCB from sediments. During a typical bloom in New Bedford Harbor, &quot;U. rigida&quot; forms a thick mat that lies on top of and in contact with the sediment. This allows for &quot;U. rigida&quot; to uptake large amounts of PCB from the sediment with concentrations of PCB in &quot;U. rigida&quot; reaching 1580 μg kg−1 within 24 hours of the bloom. Live tissue tended to take up higher concentrations of PCB than dead tissue, but this is not to say that dead tissue did not still take up large amounts of PCB as well.

==Homologs==
For a complete list of the 209 PCB congeners, see PCB congener list. Note that biphenyl, while not technically a PCB congener because of its lack of chlorine substituents, is still typically included in the literature.

<doc id="48232" wikidata="Q43413" url="?curid=48232" title="Phenyl group">
<text>In organic chemistry, the phenyl group, or phenyl ring, is a cyclic group of atoms with the formula , and is often represented by the symbol Ph (archaically φ) or Ø. The phenyl group is closely related to benzene and can be viewed as a benzene ring, minus a hydrogen, which may be replaced by some other element or compound to serve as a functional group. A phenyl group has six carbon atoms bonded together in a hexagonal planar ring, five of which are bonded to individual hydrogen atoms, with the remaining carbon bonded to a substituent. Phenyl groups are commonplace in organic chemistry. Although often depicted with alternating double and single bonds, the phenyl group is chemically aromatic and has equal bond lengths between carbon atoms in the ring.

==Nomenclature==
Usually, a &quot;phenyl group&quot; is synonymous with and is represented by the symbol Ph (archaically, Φ), or Ø. Benzene is sometimes denoted as PhH. Phenyl groups are generally attached to other atoms or groups. For example, triphenylmethane () has three phenyl groups attached to the same carbon center. Many or even most phenyl compounds are not described with the term &quot;phenyl&quot;. For example, the chloro derivative is normally called chlorobenzene, although it could be called phenyl chloride. In special (and rare) cases, isolated phenyl groups are detected: the phenyl anion (), the phenyl cation (), and the phenyl radical ().

Although Ph and phenyl uniquely denote , substituted derivatives also are described using the phenyl terminology. For example, is nitrophenyl, and is pentafluorophenyl. Monosubstituted phenyl groups (that is, disubstituted benzenes) are associated with electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions and the products follow the arene substitution pattern. So, a given substituted phenyl compound has three isomers, &quot;ortho&quot; (1,2-disubstitution), &quot;meta&quot; (1,3-disubstitution) and &quot;para&quot; (1,4-disubstitution). A disubstituted phenyl compound (trisubstituted benzene) may be, for example, 1,3,5-trisubstituted or 1,2,3-trisubstituted. Higher degrees of substitution, of which the pentafluorophenyl group is an example, exist and are named according to IUPAC nomenclature.

===Etymology===
Phenyl is derived , which in turn derived , as the first phenyl compounds named were byproducts of making and refining various gases used for lighting. According to McMurry, &quot;The word is derived , commemorating the discovery of benzene by Michael Faraday in 1825 from the oily residue left by the illuminating gas used in London street lamps.&quot;

==Structure, bonding, and characterization==
Phenyl compounds are derived from benzene (), at least conceptually and often in terms of their production. In terms of its electronic properties, the phenyl group is related to a vinyl group. It is generally considered an inductively withdrawing group (-&quot;I&quot;), because of the higher electronegativity of sp2 carbon atoms, and a resonance donating group (+&quot;M&quot;), due to the ability of its π system to donate electron density when conjugation is possible. The phenyl group is hydrophobic. Phenyl groups tend to resist oxidation and reduction. Phenyl groups (like all aromatic compounds) have enhanced stability in comparison to equivalent bonding in aliphatic (non-aromatic) groups. This increased stability is due to the unique properties of aromatic molecular orbitals.

The bond lengths between carbon atoms in a phenyl group are approximately 1.4 Å.

In 1H-NMR spectroscopy, protons of a phenyl group typically have chemical shifts around 7.27 ppm. These chemical shifts are influenced by aromatic ring current and may change depending on substituents.

==Preparation, occurrence, and applications==
Phenyl groups are usually introduced using reagents that behave as sources of the phenyl anion or the phenyl cation. Representative reagents include phenyllithium () and phenylmagnesium bromide (). Electrophiles are attacked by benzene to give phenyl derivatives:
:&lt;chem&gt;C6H6 + E+ -&gt; C6H5E + H+&lt;/chem&gt;
where (the &quot;electrophile&quot;) = . These reactions are called electrophilic aromatic substitutions.
Phenyl groups are found in many organic compounds, both natural and synthetic (see figure). Most common among natural products is the amino acid phenylalanine, which contains a phenyl group. A major product of the petrochemical industry is &quot;BTX&quot; consisting of benzene, toluene, and xylene - all of which are building blocks for phenyl compounds. The polymer polystyrene is derived from a phenyl-containing monomer and owes its properties to the rigidity and hydrophobicity of the phenyl groups. Many drugs as well as many pollutants contain phenyl rings.
One of the simplest phenyl-containing compounds is phenol, . It is often said the resonance stability of phenol makes it a stronger acid than that of aliphatic alcohols such as ethanol (p&quot;K&quot;a = 10 vs. 16–18). However, a significant contribution is the greater electronegativity of the &quot;sp&quot;2 alpha carbon in phenol compared to the &quot;sp&quot;3 alpha carbon in aliphatic alcohols.

<text>Dafydd ap Gwilym ( 1315/1320 – 1350/1370) is regarded as one of the leading Welsh poets and amongst the great poets of Europe in the Middle Ages. Dafydd’s poetry also offers a unique window into the transcultural movement of cultural practices and preservation of culture in the face of occupation. Dafydd also helps answer questions that linger over the spread of culture. Even though it has been given less attention, cultural development in Wales differed slightly than in other parts of Europe during the same time.

==Life==
R. Geraint Gruffydd suggests 1315- 1350 as the poet&#x27;s dates; others place him a little later from 1320-40 1370-80.

Later tradition has it that Dafydd was born at Brogynin, Penrhyn-coch (at the time Llanbadarn Fawr parish), Ceredigion. His father, Gwilym Gam, and mother, Ardudfyl, were both from noble families. As one of noble birth it seems Dafydd did not belong to the guild of professional poets in medieval Wales, and yet the poetic tradition had been strong in his family for generations.

According to R. Geraint Gruffydd he died in 1350, a possible victim of the Black Death. Tradition says that he was buried within the precinct of the Cistercian Strata Florida Abbey, Ceredigion. This burial location is disputed by supporters of the Talley Abbey theory who contend that burial took place in the Talley Abbey Churchyard:
On Saturday 15 September 1984 a memorial stone was unveiled by a Prifardd to mark the site in the churchyard at Talley where a deeply-rooted tradition asserts that the poet Dafydd ap Gwilym lies buried. For many centuries the rival claims of Talley and Ystrad Fflur have been debated as the burialplace of Wales’ foremost poet.While it may be difficult to trace the exact years Dafydd was active, it is clear he wrote after the Edwardian conquests of Wales. Despite living under English authority, Dafydd’s poetry presents ways in which Welsh culture continued to distinguish itself and prevail. Some of Dafydd’s poetry outright reflects rejection of the standards of English authority, like in one poem where he draws attention to the state of housing after English subjugation of Wales.

The first recorded observation that Dafydd ap Gwilym was buried in Talley was made in the sixteenth century. Talley is located about 30 miles from Strata Florida (Welsh: Ystrad Fflur).

== Welsh literature after the Norman invasion ==
While Dafydd’s work displays the role literature played in forming Welsh culture in the early 14th century, artistic expression of culture was not as prevalent in the centuries prior. A large majority of cultural expression was demonstrated militarily, as the Welsh suffered many incursions by Norman and English invaders.

As the English kingdom fell to William I’s Norman conquest, Welsh holdings that were already contested by the English fell to Norman power. Immediately, William I placed William fitz Osbern in charge of managing the defense of the holdings. Quickly, Norman and trusted Anglo-Saxon nobility were put into centers of control within Welsh lands. The Norman Invasions began a long period where the preservation of Welsh culture coincided with the need for military defense.

In the following decades, the Norman advance grew slow, as the Welsh had time to plan defenses unlike their English counterparts. As the campaigns drew on, marcher lordships were established on the border of Wales to help facilitate a defense against any counter-incursions. Due to the relative freedom granted to marcher lords, local marcher lords would often compete over territory. The lack of pressure exercised on Welsh authorities during the period of marcher lordships allowed Welsh cultural authority to strengthen in regions not controlled by the Normans or English.

In 1277, after multiple attempts to gain more local authority by the Welsh, Edward I began his conquests of the Welsh territories to firmly plant control in English hands. Within 5 years of the conquest’s start, most of Wales was under English control. Under English control, the newly acquired Welsh territories saw a large expansion of English influence. The English made large investments into Welsh infrastructure and instituted new laws that would align more similarly to English law. This period of Welsh history saw Welsh culture physically dominated by English occupation; however, the peace brought under English rule allowed for Welsh culture to manifest in more artistic means. Poetry, like Dafydd’s, became a more popular expression of Welsh culture because there was less of a united interest on warfare and defense.

==Themes in Dafydd&#x27;s poetry==
It is believed that about one hundred and seventy of his poems have survived, though many others have been attributed to him over the centuries. His main themes were love and nature. The influence of wider European ideas of courtly love, as exemplified in the troubadour poetry of Provençal, is seen as a significant influence on Dafydd&#x27;s poetry. Courtly love was not a unique theme of Dafydd’s poetry. While courtly love is primarily associated with the literature of mainland Europe, its elements can be found in works across the British Isles. Elements of courtly love have been noted in Welsh literature well before the Dafydd’s active days, suggesting that courtly love grew as a culturally connected phenomena across European literature.

Dafydd’s poetry reflected the individuality of his own personal as well as Welsh cultural expression through his unique expression of common literary practices, as well as his individual voice in his poetry. One aspect that differed from conventional poetry in Dafydd’s works was the use of himself as the subject. Traditional contemporary poetry traditionally kept the poet far removed from the scene. Dafydd&#x27;s work, in contrast, is full of his own feelings and experiences, and he is a key figure in this transition from a primarily social poetic tradition into one in which the poet&#x27;s own vision and art is given precedence. Dafydd’s poetry was also unique in its expressions of religion and nature. In “Praise of Summer,” Dafydd praises both the divine and the changing of summer as connected and benevolent. Reference to the divine in prior and contemporary literature usually depicted strong themes of judgement and virtue. With Dafydd’s poetry, we see these forces as a gift worth celebrating.

Dafydd’s poetry also differs from the conventions of other love poetry in its use of sexual metaphor. Some of Dafydd’s poetry, such as “A Poem in Praise of the Penis” display explicit connection to sexual desire. Yet, Dafydd was also well adept at keeping his metaphors subtle. In “The Lady Goldsmith,” Dafydd praises his devotion to a woman who creates attire out of her hair and nature’s bristle. In the poem, the woman crafts a belt for Dafydd. In this poem, the metaphor of sexual desire is drawn from the proximity of the woman’s hair to Dafydd’s waist. The belt itself stands as the sexual connection between this woman and Dafydd. In contrast, traditional courtly love literature tended to shy away from praising sexual desire in favor of patience and virtuous romance.

He was an innovative poet who was responsible for popularising the metre known as the &quot;cywydd&quot; and first to use it for praise. Dafydd also has been credited for popularizing the meter form known as “cynghanedd.” The continued use of cynghanedd and cywydd by Welsh poets after Dafydd’s active years is a testament to the effect Dafydd had on shaping Welsh literary culture. Dafydd’s poetry provided a framework for which Welsh literary culture could grow its own unique traditions.

Although Dafydd wrote comparatively conventional praise poetry, he also wrote love poetry and poetry expressing a personal wonderment at nature; Dafydd&#x27;s poetry on the latter subject in particular is largely without precedent in Welsh or European literature in terms of its depth and complexity. His popularity during his own historic period is testified by the fact that so many of his poems were selected for preservation in texts, despite a relatively short career compared to some of his contemporaries.

Many of his poems are addressed to women, but particularly to two of them, Morfudd and Dyddgu. His best-known works include the following poems:

*&quot;Morfudd fel yr haul&quot; (Morfudd Like the Sun), a poem to the wife of an Aberystwyth merchant who seems to have had a long affair with Dafydd, and whom he addressed in many poems;
*&quot;Merched Llanbadarn&quot; (The Girls of Llanbadarn), in which he speaks of going to church on Sunday in order to ogle the local women;
*&quot;Trafferth mewn tafarn&quot; (Trouble at a Tavern), in which he comically recounts the injuries and difficulties he faces trying to meet his lover in a tavern;
*&quot;Yr wylan&quot; (The Seagull), a poem in which Dafydd asks a seagull to carry a message to his love;
*&quot;Y Rhugl Groen&quot; (The Rattle Bag), in which Dafydd&#x27;s intercourse with a young girl is cruelly interrupted; and
*&quot;Cywydd y gal&quot; (A Poem in Praise of the Penis), a risqué piece of pure medieval erotica. Until recently not included in editions of Dafydd&#x27;s works.

The lyrics to the &quot;Lied&quot; &#x27;Der Traum&#x27; in Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s 1810 collection &quot;26 Welsh Songs&quot; are a German translation and adaption of a dream-vision poem supposedly by Dafydd, though not to be found among his works or in his apocrypha.

== Dafydd&#x27;s window into Welsh culture ==
The development of culture has been a topic of discussion for many years. As Robert Bartlett argues, European cultures formed in a homogeneous nature, primarily through conquest and settlement. This view has a favorable outlook if you take Wales in the time of Dafydd. The Welsh had become predominantly subservient to the English after the Edwardian conquests. Bartlett might argue that the cultural developments that came in the period of peace after the conquests is evidence for this principle of assimilation.

Some contend still that cultures developed as a product of their internal audiences. In the case of Dafydd, Helen Fulton argues that his poetry reflected the values admired by Welsh audiences and reflected values of the culture’s uniqueness. In this context, Welsh culture is formed outside of outside influences of other cultures.

Others place their arguments somewhere on a spectrum of these two extremes. Andrew Breeze has noted that from even the earliest evidence of Welsh literature, there are many similarities between works of cultures from close and far proximity to the Welsh. While some of these similarities are directly attributed to warfare, there is also an apparent spread of cultural traditions peacefully. The argument is taken further by Carol Llyod Wood, who demonstrates how intermarriage and architectural similarity amongst various regions also support an idea of passive cultural diffusion. Although, when looking at architecture from after the Edwardian conquests, the narratives of the polarized views tend to be amplified. Architecture tended to reflect the cultures of either the Welsh or English based on the level of authority of either group in the region.

Dafydd’s poetry reflects the multiple avenues in which cultural exchange manifested in medieval Europe. Dafydd had clear influences by traditions of foreign origin that became used often in his poetry. Some of Dafydd’s poetry also reflects the assimilation and domination present by the Edwardian conquests. Yet, Dafydd also displays poetic structure that would become part of the Welsh literary identity. Scratching the surface of Dafydd’s poetry reveals that culture was defined and controlled by many aspects, and not just one major force.

When looking at a successor of Dafydd, Guto’r Glyn, one is able see to how these forces that control culture interact in a different context. Like Dafydd, Glyn used cywydd meter and referenced himself in his poetry; however, in Glyn’s “Moliant i Syr Rhisiart Gethin ap Rhys Gethin o Fuellt, capten Mantes yn Ffrainc,” one can see other influences in Welsh literary culture. The poem praises an English lord in the same manner of classic heroes such as Arthur. God is also mentioned as an omnipotent protector. Glyn’s poem demonstrates a much more traditional approach of gallantry and chivalry popular in continental European literature. Glyn also demonstrates the principle of assimilation in the sense that the English are viewed as equals or interchangeable with the Welsh. Despite taking influence from a previous Welsh figure in Dafydd, Glyn also demonstrates the effect outside influences had in shaping Welsh literary culture.

It is fair to say Dafydd was important in establishing certain customs that would become popular among Welsh literary culture. Although literary culture was very prevalent in the identities of medieval cultures, it often gets overlooked in larger debates about the spread of culture. By looking at Dafydd ap Gwilym, literary culture appears as just as an important part of Welsh cultural identity as resistance to occupation was.

<doc id="48234" wikidata="Q1388537" url="?curid=48234" title="Hedd Wyn">
<text>Hedd Wyn (born Ellis Humphrey Evans, 13 January 188731 July 1917) was a Welsh-language poet who was killed on the first day of the Battle of Passchendaele during World War I. He was posthumously awarded the bard&#x27;s chair at the 1917 National Eisteddfod. Evans, who had been awarded several chairs for his poetry, was inspired to take the bardic name &quot;Hedd Wyn&quot; (, &quot;blessed peace&quot;) from the way sunlight penetrated the mist in the Meirionnydd valleys.

Born in the village of Trawsfynydd, Wales, Evans wrote much of his poetry while working as a shepherd on his family&#x27;s hill farm. His style, which was influenced by romantic poetry, was dominated by themes of nature and religion. He also wrote several war poems following the outbreak of war on the Western Front in 1914.

==Early life==
Ellis Humphrey Evans was born on 13 January 1887 at Penlan, a house in the centre of Trawsfynydd, Meirionydd, Wales. He was the eldest of eleven children born to Evan and Mary Evans. In the spring of 1887, the family moved to his father&#x27;s family 168-acre hill-farm of Yr Ysgwrn, in Cwm Prysor, a few miles from Trawsfynydd. He spent his life there, apart from a short stint in South Wales.

Ellis Evans received a basic education from the age of six at the local primary school and Sunday school. He left school around fourteen years of age and worked as a shepherd on his father&#x27;s farm. Despite his brief attendance in formal schooling (6–14) he had a talent for poetry and had already composed his first poem by the age of eleven, &quot;Y Das Fawn&quot; (the peat stack). Ellis&#x27;s interests included both Welsh and English poetry. His main influence was the Romantic poetry of Percy Bysshe Shelley, and themes of nature and religion dominated his work.

== Eisteddfodau ==
His talent for poetry was well known in the village of Trawsfynydd, and he took part in numerous competitions and local eisteddfodau, winning his first chair (&quot;Cadair y Bardd&quot;) at Bala in 1907, aged 20. In 1910, he was given the bardic name Hedd Wyn by the bard Bryfdir at a poets&#x27; meeting in Blaenau Ffestiniog. &#x27;Hedd&#x27; is Welsh for peace and &#x27;Wyn&#x27; can mean white or pure; this &quot;blessed peace&quot; also alluded to the way rays of sunlight penetrated the mists in the Meirionydd valleys.

Bryfdir was the bardic name of Evans&#x27;s older friend Humphrey Jones (1867–1947), a quarryman from Blaenau Ffestiniog; in his lifetime, Jones published two volumes of poetry, won more than 60 bardic chairs and was an eisteddfodau compère. Jones said he bestowed Hedd Wyn on Evans because he had the manner of a dreamer who moved slowly and calmly. Another close friend of Hedd Wyn was the clergyman and writer R. Silyn Roberts, who was known as &#x27;Rhosyr&#x27;.

In 1913, 26-year-old Hedd Wyn began to find fame for his poetry when he won chairs at the local eisteddfodau at Pwllheli and Llanuwchllyn. In 1915 he was successful at local eisteddfodau in Pontardawe and Llanuwchllyn. That same year he entered his first poem &quot;Eryri&quot; (an ode to Snowdonia) in the National Eisteddfod of Wales which was held in Bangor, Gwynedd. The following year he took second place at the National Eisteddfod in Aberystwyth with &quot;Ystrad Fflur&quot;, an awdl written in honour of Strata Florida, the medieval Cistercian abbey ruins in Ceredigion.

==First World War==
Hedd Wyn was a Christian pacifist and did not enlist for the war initially, feeling he could never kill anyone. The war left Welsh non-conformists deeply divided. Traditionally, the Nonconformists had not been comfortable at all with the idea of warfare. The war saw a major clash within Welsh Nonconformism between those who backed military action and those who adopted a pacifist stance on religious grounds.

The war inspired Hedd Wyn&#x27;s work and produced some of his most noted poetry, including &quot;Plant Trawsfynydd&quot; (&quot;Children of Trawsfynydd&quot;), &quot;Y Blotyn Du&quot; (&quot;The Black Dot&quot;), and &quot;Nid â’n Ango&quot; (&quot;[It] Will Not Be Forgotten&quot;). His poem, &quot;Rhyfel&quot; (&quot;War&quot;), remains one of his most frequently quoted works.
===Conscription===
Although farm work was classed as a reserved occupation due its national importance, in 1916, the Evans family were required to send one of their sons to join the British Army. The 29-year-old Ellis enlisted rather than his younger brother Robert. In February 1917, he received his training at Litherland Camp, Liverpool, but in March 1917 the government called for farm workers to help with ploughing and many soldiers were temporarily released. Hedd Wyn was given seven weeks&#x27; leave. He spent most of this leave working on the awdl &quot;Yr Arwr&quot; (&quot;The Hero&quot;), his submission for the National Eisteddfod. According to his nephew, Gerald Williams, &quot;It was a wet year in 1917. He came back for fourteen days leave and wrote the poem, &quot;Yr Arwr&quot;, on the table by the fire. As it was such a wet year, he stayed for another seven days. This extra seven days made him a deserter. So the military police came to fetch him from the hayfield and took him to the jail at Blaenau. From there he travelled to... the war in Belgium. Because he left in such a hurry he forgot the poem on the table, so he wrote it again on the journey. So there are two copies: one in Aberystwyth and one in Bangor.&quot;

In June 1917, Hedd Wyn joined the 15th Battalion Royal Welsh Fusiliers (part of the 38th (Welsh) Division) at Fléchin, France. His arrival depressed him, as exemplified in his quote, &quot;Heavy weather, heavy soul, heavy heart. That is an uncomfortable trinity, isn’t it?&quot; Nevertheless, at Fléchin he finished his National Eisteddfod entry and signed it “Fleur de Lis”. It is believed it was sent via the Royal Mail around the end of June. On 31 July 15 Battalion marched towards the major offensive which would become known as the Battle of Passchendaele.

===Third Battle of Ypres and death===

Hedd Wyn was fatally wounded within the first few hours of the start of the Third Battle of Ypres on 31 July, 1917. He fell during the Battle of Pilckem Ridge which had begun at 3:50 a.m. with a heavy bombardment of the German lines (this was the opening attack in what became known as Battle of Passchendaele). However, the troops&#x27; advance was hampered by incoming artillery and machine gun fire, and by heavy rain turning the battlefield to swamp.

Private Evans, as part of the 15th (Service) Battalion (1st London Welsh), was advancing towards a German strongpoint –created within the ruins of the Belgian hamlet of Hagebos (&quot;Iron Cross&quot;)– when he was hit. In an interview conducted in 1975 by St Fagans National History Museum, Simon Jones, a veteran of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, recalled, &quot;We started over Canal Bank at Ypres, and he was killed half way across Pilckem. I&#x27;ve heard many say that they were with Hedd Wyn and this and that, well I was with him... I saw him fall and I can say that it was a nosecap shell in his stomach that killed him. You could tell that... He was going in front of me, and I saw him fall on his knees and grab two fistfuls of dirt... He was dying, of course... There were stretcher bearers coming up behind us, you see. There was nothing – well, you&#x27;d be breaking the rules if you went to help someone who was injured when you were in an attack.&quot;

Soon after being wounded, Hedd Wyn was carried to a first-aid post. Still conscious, he asked the doctor &quot;Do you think I will live?&quot; though it was clear that he had little chance of surviving; he died at about 11:00 a.m. Among the fatalities that day was the Irish war poet, Francis Ledwidge, who was &quot;blown to bits&quot; while drinking tea in a shell hole.

Ellis H. Evans was buried in Section II, Row F, Grave 11 at Artillery Wood Cemetery, near Boezinge. After a petition was submitted to the Imperial War Graves Commission after the war, his headstone was given the additional words &quot;Y Prifardd Hedd Wyn&quot; (English: &quot;The Chief Bard, Hedd Wyn&quot;).

==Legacy==
===National Eisteddfod===
On 6 September 1917, the ceremony of Chairing of the Bard took place at the National Eisteddfod in Birkenhead Park, England; in attendance was the Welsh-speaking British Prime Minister, David Lloyd George. After the adjudicators announced that the entry submitted under the pseudonym &quot;Fleur de Lys&quot; was the winner, the trumpets were sounded for the author to identify themselves. After three such summons, Archdruid Dyfed solemnly announced that the winner had been killed in action six weeks earlier. The empty chair was then draped in a black sheet. It was delivered to Evans&#x27;s parents in the same condition, &quot;the festival in tears and the poet in his grave&quot;, as Archdruid Dyfed said. The festival is now referred to as &quot;Eisteddfod y Gadair Ddu&quot; (&quot;The Eisteddfod of the Black Chair&quot;).

The chair was hand-crafted by Flemish craftsman, Eugeen Vanfleteren (1880–1950), a carpenter born in Mechelen, Belgium, who had fled to England on the outbreak of war and had settled in Birkenhead.

===Manuscripts and publications===

Immediately after the Eisteddfod, a committee was formed in Trawsfynydd to look after the poet&#x27;s legacy. Under the leadership of J. R. Jones, the head teacher of the village school, all manuscripts in the poet&#x27;s hand were collected and carefully preserved. Due to the committee&#x27;s efforts, the first anthology of the bard&#x27;s work, titled &quot;Cerddi&#x27;r Bugail&quot; (&quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Poems&quot;), was published in 1918. The manuscripts were donated to the National Library of Wales in 1934.

&quot;Hedd Wyn, Ei Farddoniaeth&quot;, a complete Welsh language anthology of his works, was published by Trawsfynydd&#x27;s Merilang Press in 2012.

The poem &quot;Yr Arwr&quot; (&quot;The Hero&quot;), for which Hedd Wyn won the National Eisteddfod, is still considered his greatest work. The ode is structured in four parts and presents two principal characters, &quot;Merch y Drycinoedd&quot; (&quot;Daughter of the Tempests&quot;) and the &quot;Arwr&quot;. There has been much disagreement in the past regarding the meaning of the ode. It can be said with certainty that Hedd Wyn, like his favourite poet Shelley, longed for a perfect humanity and a perfect world during the chaos of war.

&quot;Merch y Drycinoedd&quot; has been perceived as a symbol of love, the beauty of nature, and creativity; and &quot;Yr Arwr&quot; as a symbol of goodness, fairness, freedom, and justice. It is wished that through his sacrifice, and his union with &quot;Merch y Drycinoedd&quot; at the end of the ode, a better age will come.

===Trawsfynydd and Yr Ysgwrn===

A bronze statue of Hedd Wyn, dressed as a shepherd, was unveiled by his mother in the centre of the village in 1923. It bears an englyn which Hedd Wyn had written in memory of a slain friend, Tommy Morris.
Evans&#x27;s bardic chair is on permanent display at his family&#x27;s hill farm, Yr Ysgwrn. The property was preserved just as it was in 1917 by the poet&#x27;s family and his nephew Gerald Williams (d. 2021), who was the last of his relatives to live on the farm. For years, Gerald and his brother Ellis continued to farm the land surrounding the farmhouse as custodians of both Yr Ysgwrn and Hedd Wyn’s legacy, welcoming visitors and working to ensure Hedd Wyn’s story lived on. In 2012, fourteen years after Ellis&#x27;s death, Gerald decided it was time to pass on the custodianship of Yr Ysgwrn to the Snowdonia National Park Authority.

The Park Authority, with support from the Welsh Government and the National Lottery, announced on St David&#x27;s Day 2012 that it had acquired the Grade II-listed farmstead and its surrounding lands for the Welsh nation. The Authority&#x27;s objectives are to protect and preserve the site while enhancing the visitor experience in order to share the story of Hedd Wyn. In the same year, Gerald Williams was awarded an MBE for his &quot;exceptional contribution&quot; to conserving the heritage of his bardic uncle.

===Centennial commemorations===
In August 2014, the Welsh Memorial Park, Ypres was unveiled at Pilckem Ridge near Ypres. The war memorial stands close to the spot where Hedd Wyn was mortally wounded in July 1917 during the Battle of Passchendaele.

To mark the 100th anniversary of his death, a Bardic chair was made to celebrate the life of Hedd Wyn. It was presented to the Welsh Government at a special service of remembrance at Birkenhead Park in September 2017. A memorial to the poet was also unveiled in the park, the site of the 1917 National Eisteddfod.

In November 2017, as part of the annual British Armistice commemorations, a video installation commemorating the life of Hedd Wyn was beamed onto the exterior walls of the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth. The work was the culmination of a project involving more than 800 schoolchildren and adults at primary and secondary schools across Wales which looked at the life and legacy of the poet.

==In popular culture==

===Film===
The anti-war biopic &quot;Hedd Wyn&quot; was released in 1992. The film, which starred Huw Garmon as the poet, is based on a screenplay by Alan Llwyd. It depicts Hedd Wyn as a tragic hero who has an intense dislike of the wartime ultranationalism which surrounds him and his doomed struggle to avoid conscription.

In 1993, &quot;Hedd Wyn&quot; won the Royal Television Society&#x27;s Television Award for Best Single Drama. It became the first British motion picture to be nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 66th Academy Awards in 1993. In 1994, at the newly inaugurated BAFTA Cymru Awards, it won in six categories: Best Director (Paul Turner), Best Design (by Jane Roberts and Martin Morley), Best Drama – Welsh (Shan Davies and Paul Turner), Best Editor (Chris Lawrence), Best Original Music (John E.R. Hardy) and Best Screenwriter – Welsh (Alan Llwyd).

===Literature===
&quot;The Black Chair&quot;, a 2009 novel for young people by Phil Carradice, is based on the life of Hedd Wyn. In July 2017, Y Lolfa published &quot;An Empty Chair&quot;, a novel for young people telling the story of Hedd Wyn as seen from the point of view of his teenage sister, Anni (mother of Gerald Williams). It is an adaptation by Haf Llewelyn of her prize-winning Welsh-language novel, &quot;Diffodd Y Sêr&quot;.

=== Music ===
The track &quot;Halflife&quot; on the 2015 album &quot;Everyone Was a Bird&quot; by avant garde electronica group Grasscut references Hedd Wyn as a figure in the history of Trawsfynydd, merging his presence with that of the reactors of the Trawsfynydd nuclear power station.

===Opera===

The 2017 opera &quot;2117/Hedd Wyn&quot;, with music by Stephen McNeff and libretto by Gruff Rhys, was inspired by the life of Hedd Wyn; set in the year 2117, it imagines a group of schoolchildren in a post-apocalyptic Trawsfynydd learning about the life and work of the poet. It was recorded by Ty Cerdd Records and released in 2022.
