<text>Fever or pyrexia in humans is a symptom of an anti-infection defense mechanism that appears with body temperature exceeding the normal range due to an increase in the body&#x27;s temperature set point in the hypothalamus. There is no single agreed-upon upper limit for normal temperature: sources use values ranging between in humans.

The increase in set point triggers increased muscle contractions and causes a feeling of cold or chills. This results in greater heat production and efforts to conserve heat. When the set point temperature returns to normal, a person feels hot, becomes flushed, and may begin to sweat. Rarely a fever may trigger a febrile seizure, with this being more common in young children. Fevers do not typically go higher than .

A fever can be caused by many medical conditions ranging from non-serious to life-threatening. This includes viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections—such as influenza, the common cold, meningitis, urinary tract infections, appendicitis, Lassa fever, COVID-19, and malaria. Non-infectious causes include vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis, connective tissue disease, side effects of medication or vaccination, and cancer. It differs from hyperthermia, in that hyperthermia is an increase in body temperature over the temperature set point, due to either too much heat production or not enough heat loss.

Treatment to reduce fever is generally not required. Treatment of associated pain and inflammation, however, may be useful and help a person rest. Medications such as ibuprofen or paracetamol (acetaminophen) may help with this as well as lower temperature. Children younger than three months require medical attention, as might people with serious medical problems such as a compromised immune system or people with other symptoms. Hyperthermia requires treatment.

Fever is one of the most common medical signs. It is part of about 30% of healthcare visits by children and occurs in up to 75% of adults who are seriously sick. While fever evolved as a defense mechanism, treating a fever does not appear to improve or worsen outcomes. Fever is often viewed with greater concern by parents and healthcare professionals than is usually deserved, a phenomenon known as &quot;fever phobia.&quot;
==Associated symptoms==
A fever is usually accompanied by sickness behavior, which consists of lethargy, depression, loss of appetite, sleepiness, hyperalgesia, dehydration, and the inability to concentrate. Sleeping with a fever can often cause intense or confusing nightmares, commonly called &quot;fever dreams&quot;. Mild to severe delirium (which can also cause hallucinations) may also present itself during high fevers.

==Diagnosis==

A range for normal temperatures has been found. Central temperatures, such as rectal temperatures, are more accurate than peripheral temperatures.
Fever is generally agreed to be present if the elevated temperature is caused by a raised set point and:
* Temperature in the anus (rectum/rectal) is at or over . An ear (tympanic) or forehead (temporal) temperature may also be used.
* Temperature in the mouth (oral) is at or over in the morning or over in the afternoon
* Temperature under the arm (axillary) is usually about below core body temperature.

In adults, the normal range of oral temperatures in healthy individuals is among men and among women, while when taken rectally it is among men and among women, and for ear measurement it is among men and among women.

Normal body temperatures vary depending on many factors, including age, sex, time of day, ambient temperature, activity level, and more. Normal daily temperature variation has been described as 0.5 °C (0.9 °F). A raised temperature is not always a fever. For example, the temperature rises in healthy people when they exercise, but this is not considered a fever, as the set point is normal. On the other hand, a &quot;normal&quot; temperature may be a fever, if it is unusually high for that person; for example, medically frail elderly people have a decreased ability to generate body heat, so a &quot;normal&quot; temperature of may represent a clinically significant fever.

===Hyperthermia===
Hyperthermia is an elevation of body temperature over the temperature set point, due to either too much heat production or not enough heat loss. Hyperthermia is thus not considered fever. Hyperthermia should not be confused with hyperpyrexia (which is a very high fever).

Clinically, it is important to distinguish between fever and hyperthermia as hyperthermia may quickly lead to death and does not respond to antipyretic medications. The distinction may however be difficult to make in an emergency setting, and is often established by identifying possible causes.

==Types==
Various patterns of measured patient temperatures have been observed, some of which may be indicative of a particular medical diagnosis:
* Continuous fever, where temperature remains above normal and does not fluctuate more than in 24 hours (e.g. in bacterial pneumonia, typhoid fever, infective endocarditis, tuberculosis, or typhus).
* Intermittent fever is present only for a certain period, later cycling back to normal (e.g., in malaria, leishmaniasis, pyemia, sepsis, or African trypanosomiasis).
* Remittent fever, where the temperature remains above normal throughout the day and fluctuates more than in 24 hours (e.g., in infective endocarditis or brucellosis).
* Pel–Ebstein fever is a cyclic fever that is rarely seen in patients with Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma.
* Undulant fever, seen in brucellosis.
* Typhoid fever is a continuous fever showing a characteristic &quot;step-ladder pattern,&quot; a step-wise increase in temperature with a high plateau.

Among the types of intermittent fever are ones specific to cases of malaria caused by different pathogens. These are:
* Quotidian fever, with a 24-hour periodicity, typical of malaria caused by &quot;Plasmodium knowlesi&quot; (&quot;P. knowlesi&quot;);
* Tertian fever, with a 48-hour periodicity, typical of later course malaria caused by &quot;P. falciparum&quot;, &quot;P. vivax&quot;, or &quot;P. ovale&quot;;
* Quartan fever, with a 72-hour periodicity, typical of later course malaria caused by &quot;P. malariae&quot;.

In addition, there is disagreement regarding whether a specific fever pattern is associated with Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma—the Pel–Ebstein fever, with patients argued to present high temperature for one week, followed by low for the next week, and so on, where the generality of this pattern is debated.

Persistent fever that cannot be explained after repeated routine clinical inquiries is called fever of unknown origin. A neutropenic fever, also called febrile neutropenia, is a fever in the absence of normal immune system function. Because of the lack of infection-fighting neutrophils, a bacterial infection can spread rapidly; this fever is, therefore, usually considered to require urgent medical attention. This kind of fever is more commonly seen in people receiving immune-suppressing chemotherapy than in apparently healthy people.

=== Hyperpyrexia ===
Hyperpyrexia is an extreme elevation of body temperature which, depending upon the source, is classified as a core body temperature greater than or equal to ; the range of hyperpyrexia includes cases considered severe (≥ 40 °C) and extreme (≥ 42 °C). It differs from hyperthermia in that one&#x27;s thermoregulatory system&#x27;s set point for body temperature is set above normal, then heat is generated to achieve it. In contrast, hyperthermia involves body temperature rising above its set point due to outside factors. The high temperatures of hyperpyrexia are considered medical emergencies, as they may indicate a serious underlying condition or lead to severe morbidity (including permanent brain damage), or to death. A common cause of hyperpyrexia is an intracranial hemorrhage. Other causes in emergency room settings include Malignant Catatonia, sepsis, Kawasaki syndrome, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, drug overdose, serotonin syndrome, and thyroid storm.

==Differential diagnosis==
Fever is a common symptom of many medical conditions:

* Infectious disease, e.g., COVID-19, dengue, Ebola, gastroenteritis, HIV, influenza, Lyme disease, rocky mountain spotted fever, secondary syphilis, malaria, mononucleosis, as well as infections of the skin, e.g., abscesses and boils.
* Immunological diseases, e.g., relapsing polychondritis, autoimmune hepatitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Horton disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, Kawasaki disease, lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, Still&#x27;s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, lymphoproliferative disorders and psoriasis;
* Tissue destruction, as a result of cerebral bleeding, crush syndrome, hemolysis, infarction, rhabdomyolysis, surgery, etc.;
* Cancers, particularly blood cancers such as leukemia and lymphomas;
* Metabolic disorders, e.g., gout, and porphyria; and
* Inherited metabolic disorder, e.g., Fabry disease.
Adult and pediatric manifestations for the same disease may differ; for instance, in COVID-19, one metastudy describes 92.8% of adults versus 43.9% of children presenting with fever.

In addition, fever can result from a reaction to an incompatible blood product.

==Function==
=== Immune function ===
Fever is thought to contribute to host defense, as the reproduction of pathogens with strict temperature requirements can be hindered, and the rates of some important immunological reactions are increased by temperature. Fever has been described in teaching texts as assisting the healing process in various ways, including:
:* increased mobility of leukocytes;
:* enhanced leukocyte phagocytosis;
:* decreased endotoxin effects; and
:* increased proliferation of T cells.

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===
A fever response to an infectious disease is generally regarded as protective, whereas fever in non-infections may be maladaptive. Studies have not been consistent on whether treating fever generally worsens or improves mortality risk. Benefits or harms may depend on the type of infection, health status of the patient and other factors. Studies using warm-blooded vertebrates suggest that they recover more rapidly from infections or critical illness due to fever. In sepsis, fever is associated with reduced mortality.

==Pathophysiology of fever induction==
===Hypothalamus===
Temperature is regulated in the hypothalamus. The trigger of a fever, called a pyrogen, results in the release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 in turn acts on the hypothalamus, which creates a systemic response in the body, causing heat-generating effects to match a new higher temperature set point. There are four receptors in which PGE2 can bind (EP1-4), with a previous study showing the EP3 subtype is what mediates the fever response. Hence, the hypothalamus can be seen as working like a thermostat. When the set point is raised, the body increases its temperature through both active generation of heat and retention of heat. Peripheral vasoconstriction both reduces heat loss through the skin and causes the person to feel cold. Norepinephrine increases thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue, and muscle contraction through shivering raises the metabolic rate.

If these measures are insufficient to make the blood temperature in the brain match the new set point in the hypothalamus, the brain orchestrates heat effector mechanisms via the autonomic nervous system or primary motor center for shivering. These may be:
* Increased heat production by increased muscle tone, shivering (muscle movements to produce heat) and release of hormones like epinephrine; and
* Prevention of heat loss, e.g., through vasoconstriction.
When the hypothalamic set point moves back to baseline—either spontaneously or via medication—normal functions such as sweating, and the reverse of the foregoing processes (e.g., vasodilation, end of shivering, and nonshivering heat production) are used to cool the body to the new, lower setting.

This contrasts with hyperthermia, in which the normal setting remains, and the body overheats through undesirable retention of excess heat or over-production of heat. Hyperthermia is usually the result of an excessively hot environment (heat stroke) or an adverse reaction to drugs. Fever can be differentiated from hyperthermia by the circumstances surrounding it and its response to anti-pyretic medications.

In infants, the autonomic nervous system may also activate brown adipose tissue to produce heat (non-shivering thermogenesis).

Increased heart rate and vasoconstriction contribute to increased blood pressure in fever.

===Pyrogens===

A pyrogen is a substance that induces fever. In the presence of an infectious agent, such as bacteria, viruses, viroids, &quot;etc&quot;., the immune response of the body is to inhibit their growth and eliminate them. The most common pyrogens are endotoxins, which are lipopolysaccharides (LPS) produced by Gram-negative bacteria such as &quot;E. coli.&quot; But pyrogens include non-endotoxic substances (derived from microorganisms other than gram-negative-bacteria or from chemical substances) as well. The types of pyrogens include internal (endogenous) and external (exogenous) to the body.

The &quot;pyrogenicity&quot; of given pyrogens varies: in extreme cases, bacterial pyrogens can act as superantigens and cause rapid and dangerous fevers. 

====Endogenous====
Endogenous pyrogens are cytokines released from monocytes (which are part of the immune system). In general, they stimulate chemical responses, often in the presence of an antigen, leading to a fever. Whilst they can be a product of external factors like exogenous pyrogens, they can also be induced by internal factors like damage associated molecular patterns such as cases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.

Major endogenous pyrogens are interleukin 1 (α and β) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Minor endogenous pyrogens include interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-β, macrophage inflammatory protein-α and macrophage inflammatory protein-β as well as interferon-α, interferon-β, and interferon-γ. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) also acts as a pyrogen, mediated by interleukin 1 (IL-1) release. These cytokine factors are released into general circulation, where they migrate to the brain&#x27;s circumventricular organs where they are more easily absorbed than in areas protected by the blood–brain barrier. The cytokines then bind to endothelial receptors on vessel walls to receptors on microglial cells, resulting in activation of the arachidonic acid pathway.

Of these, IL-1β, TNF, and IL-6 are able to raise the temperature setpoint of an organism and cause fever. These proteins produce a cyclooxygenase which induces the hypothalamic production of PGE2 which then stimulates the release of neurotransmitters such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate and increases body temperature.

==== Exogenous ====
Exogenous pyrogens are external to the body and are of microbial origin. In general, these pyrogens, including bacterial cell wall products, may act on Toll-like receptors in the hypothalamus and elevate the thermoregulatory setpoint.

An example of a class of exogenous pyrogens are bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) present in the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria. According to one mechanism of pyrogen action, an immune system protein, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), binds to LPS, and the LBP–LPS complex then binds to a CD14 receptor on a macrophage. The LBP-LPS binding to CD14 results in cellular synthesis and release of various endogenous cytokines, e.g., interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα). A further downstream event is activation of the arachidonic acid pathway.

===PGE2 release===
PGE2 release comes from the arachidonic acid pathway. This pathway (as it relates to fever), is mediated by the enzymes phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and prostaglandin E2 synthase. These enzymes ultimately mediate the synthesis and release of PGE2.

PGE2 is the ultimate mediator of the febrile response. The setpoint temperature of the body will remain elevated until PGE2 is no longer present. PGE2 acts on neurons in the preoptic area (POA) through the prostaglandin E receptor 3 (EP3). EP3-expressing neurons in the POA innervate the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), the rostral raphe pallidus nucleus in the medulla oblongata (rRPa), and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Fever signals sent to the DMH and rRPa lead to stimulation of the sympathetic output system, which evokes non-shivering thermogenesis to produce body heat and skin vasoconstriction to decrease heat loss from the body surface. It is presumed that the innervation from the POA to the PVN mediates the neuroendocrine effects of fever through the pathway involving pituitary gland and various endocrine organs.

==Management==
Fever does not necessarily need to be treated, and most people with a fever recover without specific medical attention. Although it is unpleasant, fever rarely rises to a dangerous level even if untreated. Damage to the brain generally does not occur until temperatures reach , and it is rare for an untreated fever to exceed . Treating fever in people with sepsis does not affect outcomes. Small trials have shown no benefit of treating fevers of or higher of critically ill patients in ICUs, and one trial was terminated early because patients receiving aggressive fever treatment were dying more often.

According to the NIH, the two assumptions which are generally used to argue in favor of treating fevers have not been experimentally validated. These are that (1) a fever is noxious, and (2) suppression of a fever will reduce its noxious effect. Most of the other studies supporting the association of fever with poorer outcomes have been observational in nature. In theory, these critically ill patients and those faced with additional physiologic stress may benefit from fever reduction, but the evidence on both sides of the argument appears to be mostly equivocal.

===Conservative measures===
Limited evidence supports sponging or bathing feverish children with tepid water. The use of a fan or air conditioning may somewhat reduce the temperature and increase comfort. If the temperature reaches the extremely high level of hyperpyrexia, aggressive cooling is required (generally produced mechanically via conduction by applying numerous ice packs across most of the body or direct submersion in ice water). In general, people are advised to keep adequately hydrated. Whether increased fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illnesses such as the common cold is not known.

===Medications===
Medications that lower fevers are called &quot;antipyretics&quot;. The antipyretic ibuprofen is effective in reducing fevers in children. It is more effective than acetaminophen (paracetamol) in children. Ibuprofen and acetaminophen may be safely used together in children with fevers. The efficacy of acetaminophen by itself in children with fevers has been questioned. Ibuprofen is also superior to aspirin in children with fevers. Additionally, aspirin is not recommended in children and young adults (those under the age of 16 or 19 depending on the country) due to the risk of Reye&#x27;s syndrome.

Using both paracetamol and ibuprofen at the same time or alternating between the two is more effective at decreasing fever than using only paracetamol or ibuprofen. It is not clear if it increases child comfort. Response or nonresponse to medications does not predict whether or not a child has a serious illness.

With respect to the effect of antipyretics on the risk of death in those with infection, studies have found mixed results, as of 2019.

==Epidemiology==
Fever is one of the most common medical signs. It is part of about 30% of healthcare visits by children, and occurs in up to 75% of adults who are seriously sick. About 5% of people who go to an emergency room have a fever.

==History==
A number of types of fever were known as early as 460 BC to 370 BC when Hippocrates was practicing medicine including that due to malaria (tertian or every 2 days and quartan or every 3 days). It also became clear around this time that fever was a symptom of disease rather than a disease in and of itself.

Infections presenting with fever were a major source of mortality in humans for about 200,000 years. Until the late nineteenth century, approximately half of all humans died from infections before the age of fifteen.

An older term, febricula (a diminutive form of the Latin word for fever), was once used to refer to a low-grade fever lasting only a few days. This term fell out of use in the early 20th century, and the symptoms it referred to are now thought to have been caused mainly by various minor viral respiratory infections.

==Society and culture==
===Mythology===
*Febris (&quot;fever&quot; in Latin) is the goddess of fever in Roman mythology. People with fevers would visit her temples. 
*Tertiana and Quartana are the goddesses of tertian and quartan fevers of malaria in Roman mythology.
*Jvarasura (&quot;fever-demon&quot; in Hindi) is the personification of fever and disease in Hindu and Buddhist mythology.

===Pediatrics===
Fever is often viewed with greater concern by parents and healthcare professionals than might be deserved, a phenomenon known as fever phobia, which is based in both caregiver&#x27;s and parents&#x27; misconceptions about fever in children. Among them, many parents incorrectly believe that fever is a disease rather than a medical sign, that even low fevers are harmful, and that any temperature even briefly or slightly above the oversimplified &quot;normal&quot; number marked on a thermometer is a clinically significant fever. They are also afraid of harmless side effects like febrile seizures and dramatically overestimate the likelihood of permanent damage from typical fevers. The underlying problem, according to professor of pediatrics Barton D. Schmitt, is that &quot;as parents we tend to suspect that our children&#x27;s brains may melt.&quot; As a result of these misconceptions parents are anxious, give the child fever-reducing medicine when the temperature is technically normal or only slightly elevated, and interfere with the child&#x27;s sleep to give the child more medicine.

== Other species ==

Fever is an important metric for the diagnosis of disease in domestic animals. The body temperature of animals, which is taken rectally, is different from one species to another. For example, a horse is said to have a fever above (). In species that allow the body to have a wide range of &quot;normal&quot; temperatures, such as camels, whose body temperature varies as the environmental temperature varies, the body temperature which constitutes a febrile state differs depending on the environmental temperature. Fever can also be behaviorally induced by invertebrates that do not have immune-system based fever. For instance, some species of grasshopper will thermoregulate to achieve body temperatures that are 2–5 °C higher than normal in order to inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens such as &quot;Beauveria bassiana&quot; and &quot;Metarhizium acridum&quot;. Honeybee colonies are also able to induce a fever in response to a fungal parasite &quot;Ascosphaera apis&quot;.

<text>Telemetry is the in situ collection of measurements or other data at remote points and their automatic transmission to receiving equipment (telecommunication) for monitoring. The word is derived from the Greek roots &quot;tele&quot;, &#x27;far off&#x27;, and &quot;metron&quot;, &#x27;measure&#x27;. Systems that need external instructions and data to operate require the counterpart of telemetry: telecommand.

Although the term commonly refers to wireless data transfer mechanisms (e.g., using radio, ultrasonic, or infrared systems), it also encompasses data transferred over other media such as a telephone or computer network, optical link or other wired communications like power line carriers. Many modern telemetry systems take advantage of the low cost and ubiquity of GSM networks by using SMS to receive and transmit telemetry data.

A &quot;telemeter&quot; is a physical device used in telemetry. It consists of a sensor, a transmission path, and a display, recording, or control device. Electronic devices are widely used in telemetry and can be wireless or hard-wired, analog or digital. Other technologies are also possible, such as mechanical, hydraulic and optical.

Telemetry may be commutated to allow the transmission of multiple data streams in a fixed frame.

==History==

The beginning of industrial telemetry lies in the steam age, although the sensor was not called &quot;telemeter&quot; at that time. Examples are James Watt&#x27;s (1736-1819) additions to his steam engines for monitoring from a (near) distance such as the mercury pressure gauge and the fly-ball governor.

Although the original telemeter referred to a ranging device (the rangefinding telemeter), by the late 19th century the same term had been in wide use by electrical engineers applying it refer to electrically operated devices measuring many other quantities besides distance (for instance, in the patent of an &quot;Electric Telemeter Transmitter&quot;). General telemeters included such sensors as the thermocouple (from the work of Thomas Johann Seebeck), the resistance thermometer (by William Siemens based on the work of Humphry Davy), and the electrical strain gauge (based on Lord Kelvin&#x27;s discovery that conductors under mechanical strain change their resistance) and output devices such as Samuel Morse&#x27;s telegraph sounder and the relay. In 1889 this led an author in the Institution of Civil Engineers proceedings to suggest that the term for the rangefinder telemeter might be replaced with tacheometer.

In the 1930s use of electrical telemeters grew rapidly. The electrical strain gauge was widely used in rocket and aviation research and the radiosonde was invented for meteorological measurements. The advent of World War II gave an impetus to industrial development and henceforth many of these telemeters became commercially viable.

Carrying on from rocket research, radio telemetry was used routinely as space exploration got underway. Spacecraft are in a place where a physical connection is not possible, leaving radio or other electromagnetic waves (such as infrared lasers) as the only viable option for telemetry. During crewed space missions it is used to monitor not only parameters of the vehicle, but also the health and life support of the astronauts. During the Cold War telemetry found uses in espionage. US intelligence found that they could monitor the telemetry from Soviet missile tests by building a telemeter of their own to intercept the radio signals and hence learn a great deal about Soviet capabilities.

===Types of telemeter===
Telemeters are the physical devices used in telemetry. It consists of a sensor, a transmission path, and a display, recording, or control device. Electronic devices are widely used in telemetry and can be wireless or hard-wired, analog or digital. Other technologies are also possible, such as mechanical, hydraulic and optical.

Telemetering information over wire had its origins in the 19th century. One of the first data-transmission circuits was developed in 1845 between the Russian Tsar&#x27;s Winter Palace and army headquarters. In 1874, French engineers built a system of weather and snow-depth sensors on Mont Blanc that transmitted real-time information to Paris. In 1901 the American inventor C. Michalke patented the selsyn, a circuit for sending synchronized rotation information over a distance. In 1906 a set of seismic stations were built with telemetering to the Pulkovo Observatory in Russia. In 1912, Commonwealth Edison developed a system of telemetry to monitor electrical loads on its power grid. The Panama Canal (completed 1913–1914) used extensive telemetry systems to monitor locks and water levels.

Wireless telemetry made early appearances in the radiosonde, developed concurrently in 1930 by Robert Bureau in France and Pavel Molchanov in Russia. Molchanov&#x27;s system modulated temperature and pressure measurements by converting them to wireless Morse code. The German V-2 rocket used a system of primitive multiplexed radio signals called &quot;Messina&quot; to report four rocket parameters, but it was so unreliable that Wernher von Braun once claimed it was more useful to watch the rocket through binoculars.

In the US and the USSR, the Messina system was quickly replaced with better systems; in both cases, based on pulse-position modulation (PPM).
Early Soviet missile and space telemetry systems which were developed in the late 1940s used either PPM (e.g., the Tral telemetry system developed by OKB-MEI) or pulse-duration modulation (e.g., the RTS-5 system developed by NII-885). In the United States, early work employed similar systems, but were later replaced by pulse-code modulation (PCM) (for example, in the Mars probe Mariner 4). Later Soviet interplanetary probes used redundant radio systems, transmitting telemetry by PCM on a decimeter band and PPM on a centimeter band.

==Applications==
===Meteorology===
Weather balloons use telemetry to transmit meteorological data since 1920.

===Oil and gas industry===
Telemetry is used to transmit drilling mechanics and formation evaluation information uphole, in real time, as a well is drilled. These services are known as Measurement while drilling and Logging while drilling. Information acquired thousands of feet below ground, while drilling, is sent through the drilling hole to the surface sensors and the demodulation software. The pressure wave (sana) is translated into useful information after DSP and noise filters. This information is used for Formation evaluation, Drilling Optimization, and Geosteering.

===Motor racing===
Telemetry is a key factor in modern motor racing, allowing race engineers to interpret data collected during a test or race and use it to properly tune the car for optimum performance. Systems used in series such as Formula One have become advanced to the point where the potential lap time of the car can be calculated, and this time is what the driver is expected to meet. Examples of measurements on a race car include accelerations (G forces) in three axes, temperature readings, wheel speed, and suspension displacement. In Formula One, driver input is also recorded so the team can assess driver performance and (in case of an accident) the FIA can determine or rule out driver error as a possible cause.

Later developments include two-way telemetry which allows engineers to update calibrations on the car in real time (even while it is out on the track). In Formula One, two-way telemetry surfaced in the early 1990s and consisted of a message display on the dashboard which the team could update. Its development continued until May 2001, when it was first allowed on the cars. By 2002, teams were able to change engine mapping and deactivate engine sensors from the pit while the car was on the track. For the 2003 season, the FIA banned two-way telemetry from Formula One; however, the technology may be used in other types of racing or on road cars.

One way telemetry system has also been applied in R/C racing car to get information by car&#x27;s sensors like: engine RPM, voltage, temperatures, throttle.

===Transportation===
In the transportation industry, telemetry provides meaningful information about a vehicle or driver&#x27;s performance by collecting data from sensors within the vehicle. This is undertaken for various reasons ranging from staff compliance monitoring, insurance rating to predictive maintenance.

Telemetry is used to link traffic counter devices to data recorders to measure traffic flows and vehicle lengths and weights.

Telemetry is used by the railway industry for measuring the health of trackage. This permits optimized and focused predictive and preventative maintenance. Typically this is done with specialized trains, such as the New Measurement Train used in the United Kingdom by Network Rail, which can check for track defects, such as problems with gauge, and deformations in the rail. Japan uses similar, but quicker trains, nicknamed Doctor Yellow. Such trains, besides checking the tracks, can also verify whether or not there are any problems with the overhead power supply (catenary), where it is installed. Dedicated rail inspection companies, such as Sperry Rail, have their own customized rail cars and rail-wheel equipped trucks, that use a variety of methods, including lasers, ultrasound, and induction (measuring resulting magnetic fields from running electricity into rails) to find any defects.

===Agriculture===
Most activities related to healthy crops and good yields depend on timely availability of weather and soil data. Therefore, wireless weather stations play a major role in disease prevention and precision irrigation. These stations transmit parameters necessary for decision-making to a base station: air temperature and relative humidity, precipitation and leaf wetness (for disease prediction models), solar radiation and wind speed (to calculate evapotranspiration), water deficit stress (WDS) leaf sensors and soil moisture (crucial to irrigation decisions).

Because local micro-climates can vary significantly, such data needs to come from within the crop. Monitoring stations usually transmit data back by terrestrial radio, although occasionally satellite systems are used. Solar power is often employed to make the station independent of the power grid.

===Water management===
Telemetry is important in water management, including water quality and stream gauging functions. Major applications include AMR (automatic meter reading), groundwater monitoring, leak detection in distribution pipelines and equipment surveillance. Having data available in almost real time allows quick reactions to events in the field. Telemetry control allows engineers to intervene with assets such as pumps and by remotely switching pumps on or off depending on the circumstances. Watershed telemetry is an excellent strategy of how to implement a water management system.
===Defense, space and resource exploration===
Telemetry is used in complex systems such as missiles, RPVs, spacecraft, oil rigs, and chemical plants since it allows the automatic monitoring, alerting, and record-keeping necessary for efficient and safe operation. Space agencies such as NASA, ISRO, the European Space Agency (ESA), and other agencies use telemetry and/or telecommand systems to collect data from spacecraft and satellites.

Telemetry is vital in the development of missiles, satellites and aircraft because the system might be destroyed during or after the test. Engineers need critical system parameters to analyze (and improve) the performance of the system. In the absence of telemetry, this data would often be unavailable.

====Space science====
Telemetry is used by crewed or uncrewed spacecraft for data transmission. Distances of more than 10 billion kilometres have been covered, e.g., by Voyager 1.

====Rocketry====
In rocketry, telemetry equipment forms an integral part of the rocket range assets used to monitor the position and health of a launch vehicle to determine range safety flight termination criteria (Range purpose is for public safety). Problems include the extreme environment (temperature, acceleration and vibration), the energy supply, antenna alignment and (at long distances, e.g., in spaceflight) signal travel time.

====Flight testing====
Today nearly every type of aircraft, missiles, or spacecraft carries a wireless telemetry system as it is tested. Aeronautical mobile telemetry is used for the safety of the pilots and persons on the ground during flight tests. Telemetry from an on-board flight test instrumentation system is the primary source of real-time measurement and status information transmitted during the testing of crewed and uncrewed aircraft.

====Military intelligence====
Intercepted telemetry was an important source of intelligence for the United States and UK when Soviet missiles were tested; for this purpose, the United States operated a listening post in Iran. Eventually, the Russians discovered the United States intelligence-gathering network and encrypted their missile-test telemetry signals. Telemetry was also a source for the Soviets, who operated listening ships in Cardigan Bay to eavesdrop on UK missile tests performed in the area.

===Energy monitoring===
In factories, buildings and houses, energy consumption of systems such as HVAC are monitored at multiple locations; related parameters (e.g., temperature) are sent via wireless telemetry to a central location. The information is collected and processed, enabling the most efficient use of energy. Such systems also facilitate predictive maintenance.

===Resource distribution===
Many resources need to be distributed over wide areas. Telemetry is useful in these cases, since it allows the logistics system to channel resources where they are needed, as well as provide security for those assets; principal examples of this are dry goods, fluids, and granular bulk solids.

====Dry goods====
Dry goods, such as packaged merchandise, may be tracked and remotely monitored, tracked and inventoried by RFID sensing systems, barcode reader, optical character recognition (OCR) reader, or other sensing devices—coupled to telemetry devices, to detect RFID tags, barcode labels or other identifying markers affixed to the item, its package, or (for large items and bulk shipments) affixed to its shipping container or vehicle. This facilitates knowledge of their location, and can record their status and disposition, as when merchandise with barcode labels is scanned through a checkout reader at point-of-sale systems in a retail store. Stationary or hand-held barcode RFID scanners or Optical reader with remote communications, can be used to expedite inventory tracking and counting in stores, warehouses, shipping terminals, transportation carriers and factories.

====Fluids====
Fluids stored in tanks are a principal object of constant commercial telemetry. This typically includes monitoring of tank farms in gasoline refineries and chemical plants—and distributed or remote tanks, which must be replenished when empty (as with gas station storage tanks, home heating oil tanks, or ag-chemical tanks at farms), or emptied when full (as with production from oil wells, accumulated waste products, and newly produced fluids). Telemetry is used to communicate the variable measurements of flow and tank level sensors detecting fluid movements and/or volumes by pneumatic, hydrostatic, or differential pressure; tank-confined ultrasonic, radar or Doppler effect echoes; or mechanical or magnetic sensors.

====Bulk solids====
Telemetry of bulk solids is common for tracking and reporting the volume status and condition of grain and livestock feed bins, powdered or granular food, powders and pellets for manufacturing, sand and gravel, and other granular bulk solids. While technology associated with fluid tank monitoring also applies, in part, to granular bulk solids, reporting of overall container weight, or other gross characteristics and conditions, are sometimes required, owing to bulk solids&#x27; more complex and variable physical characteristics.

===Medicine/healthcare===
Telemetry is used for patients (biotelemetry) who are at risk of abnormal heart activity, generally in a coronary care unit. Telemetry specialists are sometimes used to monitor many patients within a hospital. Such patients are outfitted with measuring, recording and transmitting devices. A data log can be useful in diagnosis of the patient&#x27;s condition by doctors. An alerting function can alert nurses if the patient is suffering from an acute (or dangerous) condition.

Systems are available in medical-surgical nursing for monitoring to rule out a heart condition, or to monitor a response to antiarrhythmic medications such as amiodarone.

A new and emerging application for telemetry is in the field of neurophysiology, or neurotelemetry. Neurophysiology is the study of the central and peripheral nervous systems through the recording of bioelectrical activity, whether spontaneous or stimulated. In neurotelemetry (NT) the electroencephalogram (EEG) of a patient is monitored remotely by a registered EEG technologist using advanced communication software. The goal of neurotelemetry is to recognize a decline in a patient&#x27;s condition before physical signs and symptoms are present.

Neurotelemetry is synonymous with real-time continuous video EEG monitoring and has application in the epilepsy monitoring unit, neuro ICU, pediatric ICU and newborn ICU. Due to the labor-intensive nature of continuous EEG monitoring NT is typically done in the larger academic teaching hospitals using in-house programs that include R.EEG Technologists, IT support staff, neurologist and neurophysiologist and monitoring support personnel.

Modern microprocessor speeds, software algorithms and video data compression allow hospitals to centrally record and monitor continuous digital EEGs of multiple critically ill patients simultaneously.

Neurotelemetry and continuous EEG monitoring provides dynamic information about brain function that permits early detection of changes in neurologic status, which is especially useful when the clinical examination is limited.

===Fishery and wildlife research and management===
Telemetry is used to study wildlife, and has been useful for monitoring threatened species at the individual level. Animals under study can be outfitted with instrumentation tags, which include sensors that measure temperature, diving depth and duration (for marine animals), speed and location (using GPS or Argos packages). Telemetry tags can give researchers information about animal behavior, functions, and their environment. This information is then either stored (with archival tags) or the tags can send (or transmit) their information to a satellite or handheld receiving device. Capturing and marking wild animals can put them at some risk, so it is important to minimize these impacts.

===Retail===
At a 2005 workshop in Las Vegas, a seminar noted the introduction of telemetry equipment which would allow vending machines to communicate sales and inventory data to a route truck or to a headquarters. This data could be used for a variety of purposes, such as eliminating the need for drivers to make a first trip to see which items needed to be restocked before delivering the inventory.

Retailers also use RFID tags to track inventory and prevent shoplifting. Most of these tags passively respond to RFID readers (e.g., at the cashier), but active RFID tags are available which periodically transmit location information to a base station.

===Law enforcement===
Telemetry hardware is useful for tracking persons and property in law enforcement. An ankle collar worn by convicts on probation can warn authorities if a person violates the terms of his or her parole, such as by straying from authorized boundaries or visiting an unauthorized location. Telemetry has also enabled bait cars, where law enforcement can rig a car with cameras and tracking equipment and leave it somewhere they expect it to be stolen. When stolen the telemetry equipment reports the location of the vehicle, enabling law enforcement to deactivate the engine and lock the doors when it is stopped by responding officers.

===Energy providers===
In some countries, telemetry is used to measure the amount of electrical energy consumed. The electricity meter communicates with a concentrator, and the latter sends the information through GPRS or GSM to the energy provider&#x27;s server. Telemetry is also used for the remote monitoring of substations and their equipment. For data transmission, phase line carrier systems operating on frequencies between 30 and 400 kHz are sometimes used.

===Falconry===
In falconry, &quot;telemetry&quot; means a small radio transmitter carried by a bird of prey that will allow the bird&#x27;s owner to track it when it is out of sight.

===Testing===
Telemetry is used in testing hostile environments which are dangerous to humans. Examples include munitions storage facilities, radioactive sites, volcanoes, deep sea, and outer space.

===Communications===
Telemetry is used in many battery operated wireless systems to inform monitoring personnel when the battery power is reaching a low point and the end item needs fresh batteries.

===Mining===
In the mining industry, telemetry serves two main purposes: the measurement of key parameters from mining equipment and the monitoring of safety practices. The information provided by the collection and analysis of key parameters allows for root-cause identification of inefficient operations, unsafe practices and incorrect equipment usage for maximizing productivity and safety. Further applications of the technology allow for sharing knowledge and best practices across the organization.

===Software===

In software, telemetry is used to gather data on the use and performance of applications and application components, e.g. how often certain features are used, measurements of start-up time and processing time, hardware, application crashes, and general usage statistics and/or user behavior. In some cases, very detailed data is reported like individual window metrics, counts of used features, and individual function timings.

This kind of telemetry can be essential to software developers to receive data from a wide variety of endpoints that can&#x27;t possibly all be tested in-house, as well as getting data on the popularity of certain features and whether they should be given priority or be considered for removal. Due to concerns about privacy since software telemetry can easily be used to profile users, telemetry in user software is often user choice, commonly presented as an opt-out feature (requiring explicit user action to disable it) or user choice during the software installation process.

==International standards==
As in other telecommunications fields, international standards exist for telemetry equipment and software. International standards producing bodies include Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) for space agencies, Inter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) for missile ranges, and Telemetering Standards Coordination Committee (TSCC), an organisation of the International Foundation for Telemetering.

<text>The Corinthian order (, &quot;Korinthiakós rythmós&quot;; ) is the last developed and most ornate of the three principal classical orders of Ancient Greek architecture and Roman architecture. The other two are the Doric order, which was the earliest, followed by the Ionic order. In Ancient Greek architecture, the Corinthian order follows the Ionic in almost all respects, other than the capitals of the columns, though this changed in Roman architecture.

A Corinthian capital may be seen as an enriched development of the Ionic capital, though one may have to look closely at a Corinthian capital to see the Ionic volutes (&quot;helices&quot;), at the corners, perhaps reduced in size and importance, scrolling out above the two ranks of stylized acanthus leaves and stalks (&quot;cauliculi&quot; or &quot;caulicoles&quot;), eight in all, and to notice that smaller volutes scroll inwards to meet each other on each side. The leaves may be quite stiff, schematic and dry, or they may be extravagantly drilled and undercut, naturalistic and spiky. The flat abacus at the top of the capital has a concave curve on each face, and usually a single flower (&quot;rosette&quot;) projecting from the leaves below overlaps it on each face.

When classical architecture was revived during the Renaissance, two more orders were added to the : the Tuscan order and the Composite order, known in Roman times, but regarded as a grand imperial variant of the Corinthian. The Corinthian has fluted columns and elaborate capitals decorated with acanthus leaves and scrolls. There are many variations.

The name &quot;Corinthian&quot; is derived from the ancient Greek city of Corinth, although it was probably invented in Athens.

==Description==
===Greek Corinthian order===

The Corinthian order is named for the Greek city-state of Corinth, to which it was connected in the period. However, according to the architectural historian Vitruvius, the column was created by the sculptor Callimachus, probably an Athenian, who drew acanthus leaves growing around a votive basket of toys, with a slab on top, on the grave of a Corinthian girl.

Its earliest use can be traced back to the Late Classical Period (430–323 BC). The earliest Corinthian capitals, already in fragments and now lost, were found in Bassae in 1811–12; they are dated around 420 BC, and are in a temple of Apollo otherwise using the Ionic. There were three of them, carrying the frieze across the far end of the cella, which was open to the adytum. The Corinthian was probably devised to solve the awkwardness the Ionic capital created at corners by having clear and distinct front or back and side-on faces, a problem only finally solved by Vincenzo Scamozzi in the 16th century.

A simplified late version of the Greek Corinthian capital is often known as the &quot;Tower of the Winds Corinthian&quot; after its use on the porches of the Tower of the Winds in Athens (about 50 BC). There is a single row of acanthus leaves at the bottom of the capital, with a row of &quot;tall, narrow leaves&quot; behind. These cling tightly to the swelling shaft, and are sometimes described as &quot;lotus&quot; leaves, as well as the vague &quot;water-leaves&quot; and palm leaves; their similarity to leaf forms on many ancient Egyptian capitals has been remarked on. The form is usually found in smaller columns, both ancient and modern.

===Roman Corinthian order===


The style developed its own model in Roman practice, following precedents set by the Temple of Mars Ultor in the Forum of Augustus (). It was employed in southern Gaul at the Maison Carrée, Nîmes and at the comparable Temple of Augustus and Livia at Vienne. Other prime examples noted by Mark Wilson Jones are the lower order of the Basilica Ulpia and the Arch of Trajan at Ancona (both of the reign of Trajan, 98–117 AD), the Column of Phocas (re-erected in Late Antiquity but 2nd century in origin), and the Temple of Bacchus at Baalbek ().

Proportion is a defining characteristic of the Corinthian order: the &quot;coherent integration of dimensions and ratios in accordance with the principles of &quot;symmetria&quot;&quot; are noted by Mark Wilson Jones, who finds that the ratio of total column height to column-shaft height is in a 6:5 ratio, so that, secondarily, the full height of column with capital is often a multiple of 6 Roman feet while the column height itself is a multiple of 5. In its proportions, the Corinthian column is similar to the Ionic column, though it is more slender, and stands apart by its distinctive carved capital.

The abacus upon the capital has concave sides to conform to the outscrolling corners of the capital, and it may have a rosette at the center of each side. Corinthian columns were erected on the top level of the Roman Colosseum, holding up the least weight, and also having the slenderest ratio of thickness to height. Their height to width ratio is about 10:1.

One variant is the Tivoli order, found at the Temple of Vesta, Tivoli. The Tivoli order&#x27;s Corinthian capital has two rows of acanthus leaves and its abacus is decorated with oversize fleurons in the form of hibiscus flowers with pronounced spiral pistils. The column flutes have flat tops. The frieze exhibits fruit festoons suspended between bucrania. Above each festoon has a rosette over its center. The cornice does not have modillions.

===Gandharan capitals===

Indo-Corinthian capitals are capitals crowning columns or pilasters, which can be found in the northwestern Indian subcontinent, and usually combine Hellenistic and Indian elements. These capitals are typically dated to the 1st centuries of our era, and constitute important elements of Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara.

The classical design was often adapted, usually taking a more elongated form, and sometimes being combined with scrolls, generally within the context of Buddhist stupas and temples. Indo-Corinthian capitals also incorporated figures of the Buddha or Bodhisattvas, usually as central figures surrounded, and often in the shade, of the luxurious foliage of Corinthian designs.

===Byzantine Empire and medieval Europe===
Though the term &quot;Corinthian&quot; is reserved for columns and capitals that adhere fairly closely to one of the classical versions, vegetal decoration to capitals continued to be extremely common in Byzantine architecture and the various styles of the European Middle Ages, from Carolingian architecture to Romanesque architecture and Gothic architecture. There was considerable freedom in the details and the relationship between column (generally not fluted) and capital. Many types of plant were represented, sometimes realistically, as in the capitals in the chapter house at Southwell Minster in England.

===Renaissance Corinthian order===

During the first flush of the Italian Renaissance, the Florentine architectural theorist Francesco di Giorgio expressed the human analogies that writers who followed Vitruvius often associated with the human form, in squared drawings he made of the Corinthian capital overlaid with human heads, to show the proportions common to both.

The Corinthian architrave is divided in two or three sections, which may be equal, or may bear interesting proportional relationships, to one with another. Above the plain, unadorned architrave lies the frieze, which may be richly carved with a continuous design or left plain, as at the U.S. Capitol extension. At the Capitol the proportions of architrave to frieze are exactly 1:1. Above that, the profiles of the cornice mouldings are like those of the Ionic order. If the cornice is very deep, it may be supported by brackets or modillions, which are ornamental brackets used in a series under a cornice.

The Corinthian column is almost always fluted, and the flutes of a Corinthian column may be enriched. They may be filleted, with rods nestled within the hollow flutes, or stop-fluted, with the rods rising a third of the way, to where the entasis begins. In French, these are called &quot;chandelles&quot; and sometimes terminate in carved wisps of flame, or with bellflowers. Alternatively, beading or chains of husks may take the place of the fillets in the fluting, Corinthian being the most flexible of the orders, with more opportunities for variation.

Elaborating upon an offhand remark when Vitruvius accounted for the origin of its acanthus capital, it became a commonplace to identify the Corinthian column with the slender figure of a young girl; in this mode the classifying French painter Nicolas Poussin wrote to his friend Fréart de Chantelou in 1642:

The beautiful girls whom you will have seen in Nîmes will not, I am sure, have delighted your spirit any less than the beautiful columns of Maison Carrée for the one is no more than an old copy of the other.

Sir William Chambers expressed the conventional comparison with the Doric order:

The proportions of the orders were by the ancients formed on those of the human body, and consequently, it could not be their intention to make a Corinthian column, which, as Vitruvius observes, is to represent the delicacy of a young girl, as thick and much taller than a Doric one, which is designed to represent the bulk and vigour of a muscular full grown man.

==History==
The oldest known example of a Corinthian column is in the Temple of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae in Arcadia, c. 450–420 BC. It is not part of the order of the temple itself, which has a Doric colonnade surrounding the temple and an Ionic order within the cella enclosure. A single Corinthian column stands free, centered within the cella. This is a mysterious feature, and archaeologists debate what this shows: some state that it is simply an example of a votive column. A few examples of Corinthian columns in Greece during the next century are all used &quot;inside&quot; temples. A more famous example, and the first documented use of the Corinthian order on the exterior of a structure, is the circular Choragic Monument of Lysicrates in Athens, erected c. 334 BC.

A Corinthian capital carefully buried in antiquity in the foundations of the circular tholos at Epidaurus was recovered during modern archaeological campaigns. Its enigmatic presence and preservation have been explained as a sculptor&#x27;s model for stonemasons to follow in erecting the temple dedicated to Asclepius. The architectural design of the building was credited in antiquity to the sculptor Polykleitos the Younger, son of the Classical Greek sculptor Polykleitos the Elder.

The temple was erected in the 4th century BC. These capitals, in one of the most-visited sacred sites of Greece, influenced later Hellenistic and Roman designs for the Corinthian order. The concave sides of the abacus meet at a sharp keel edge, easily damaged, which in later and post-Renaissance practice has generally been replaced by a canted corner. Behind the scrolls the spreading cylindrical form of the central shaft is plainly visible.

Much later, the Roman writer Vitruvius () related that the Corinthian order had been invented by Callimachus, a Greek architect and sculptor who was inspired by the sight of a votive basket that had been left on the grave of a young girl. A few of her toys were in it, and a square tile had been placed over the basket, to protect them from the weather. An acanthus plant had grown through the woven basket, mixing its spiny, deeply cut leaves with the weave of the basket.

Claude Perrault incorporated a vignette epitomizing the Callimachus tale in his illustration of the Corinthian order for his translation of Vitruvius, published in Paris, 1684. Perrault demonstrates in his engraving how the proportions of the carved capital could be adjusted according to demands of the design, without offending. The texture and outline of Perrault&#x27;s leaves is dry and tight compared to their 19th-century naturalism at the U.S. Capitol.

In Late Antique and Byzantine practice, the leaves may be blown sideways, as if by the wind of Faith. Unlike the Doric and Ionic column capitals, a Corinthian capital has no neck beneath it, just a ring-like astragal molding or a banding that forms the base of the capital, recalling the base of the legendary basket.

Most buildings (and most clients) are satisfied with just two orders. When orders are superposed one above another, as they are at the Colosseum, the natural progression is from sturdiest and plainest (Doric) at the bottom, to slenderest and richest (Corinthian) at the top. The Colosseum&#x27;s topmost tier has an unusual order that came to be known as the Composite order during the 16th century. The mid-16th-century Italians, especially Sebastiano Serlio and Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola, who established a version of the orders, thought they detected a &quot;Composite order&quot;, combining the volutes of the Ionic with the foliage of the Corinthian, but in Roman practice volutes were almost always present.

In Romanesque and Gothic architecture, where the Classical system had been replaced by a new aesthetic composed of arched vaults springing from columns, the Corinthian capital was still retained. It might be severely plain, as in the typical Cistercian architecture, which encouraged no distraction from liturgy and ascetic contemplation, or in other contexts it could be treated to numerous fanciful variations, even on the capitals of a series of columns or colonettes within the same system.

During the 16th century, a sequence of engravings of the orders in architectural treatises helped standardize their details within rigid limits: Sebastiano Serlio; the &quot;Regola delli cinque ordini&quot; of Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola (1507–1573); &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot; of Andrea Palladio, and Vincenzo Scamozzi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;idea dell&#x27;architettura universale&quot;, were followed in the 17th century by French treatises with further refined engraved models, such as Perrault&#x27;s.

<doc id="46262" wikidata="Q192692" url="?curid=46262" title="Nightmare">
<text>A nightmare, also known as a bad dream, is an unpleasant dream that can cause a strong emotional response from the mind, typically fear but also despair, anxiety, disgust or sadness. The dream may contain situations of discomfort, psychological or physical terror, or panic. After a nightmare, a person will often awaken in a state of distress and may be unable to return to sleep for a short period of time. Recurrent nightmares may require medical help, as they can interfere with sleeping patterns and cause insomnia.

Nightmares can have physical causes such as sleeping in an uncomfortable position or having a fever, or psychological causes such as stress or anxiety. Eating before going to sleep, which triggers an increase in the body&#x27;s metabolism and brain activity, can be a potential stimulus for nightmares.

The prevalence of nightmares in children (5–12 years old) is between 20 and 30%, and for adults between 8 and 30%. In common language, the meaning of &quot;nightmare&quot; has extended as a metaphor to many bad things, such as a bad situation or a scary monster or person.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;nightmare&quot; is derived from the Old English , a mythological demon or goblin who torments others with frightening dreams. The term has no connection with the Modern English word for a female horse. The word &quot;nightmare&quot; is cognate with the Dutch term and German (dated). 

Originally, &quot;mare&quot; or &quot;nightmare&quot; referred more specifically to sleep paralysis, in which an experience of terror and paralysis during sleep can be associated with a sense of pressure on the chest and the dreamed presence of entities often pictured as demons, sometimes sitting on the chest. The words also referred to such a &quot;demon,&quot; which was also referred to as a hag and the experience as being &quot;hag-ridden.&quot; The meaning of &quot;nightmare&quot; had generalized from sleep paralysis to any bad dream by 1829. In other languages, the word for &quot;bad dream&quot; similarly evolved in sense from words for &quot;sleep paralysis,&quot; often with senses related to the pressure on the chest. For example, French &quot;cauchemar&quot; (the first element from old French &quot;chauchier&quot; &quot;to press, trample,&quot; the second related to &quot;mare&quot;); Spanish &quot;pesadilla&quot;, from &quot;pesada&quot; &quot;weight&quot;; or Hungarian &quot;lidércnyomás&quot;, from &quot;nyomás&quot; &quot;pressure.&quot;

==History and folklore==
The sorcerous demons of Iranian mythology known as Divs are likewise associated with the ability to afflict their victims with nightmares.
The mare of Germanic and Slavic folklore were thought to ride on people&#x27;s chests while they sleep, causing nightmares.

==Signs and symptoms==
Those with nightmares experience abnormal sleep architecture. The impact of having a nightmare during the night has been found to be very similar to that of insomnia. This is thought to be caused by frequent nocturnal awakenings and fear of falling asleep. When awoken from REM sleep by a nightmare, the dreamer can usually recall the nightmare in detail. They may also awaken in a heightened state of distress, with an elevated heart rate or increased perspiration. Nightmare disorder symptoms include repeated awakenings from the major sleep period or naps with detailed recall of extended and extremely frightening dreams, usually involving threats to survival, security, or self-esteem. The awakenings generally occur during the second half of the sleep period.

==Classification==
According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders-Third Edition (ICSD-3), the nightmare disorder, together with REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) and recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, form the REM-related parasomnias subcategory of the Parasomnias cluster. Nightmares may be idiopathic without any signs of psychopathology or associated with disorders like stress, anxiety, substance abuse, psychiatric illness or PTSD (&gt;80% of PTSD patients report nightmares). As regarding the dream content of the dreams they are usually imprinting negative emotions like sadness, fear or rage. According to the clinical studies the content can include being chased, injury or death of others, falling, natural disasters or accidents. Typical dreams or recurrent dreams may also have some of these topics.

==Cause==
Scientific research shows that nightmares may have many causes. In a study focusing on children, researchers were able to conclude that nightmares directly correlate with the stress in children&#x27;s lives. Children who experienced the death of a family member or a close friend or know someone with a chronic illness have more frequent nightmares than those who are only faced with stress from school or stress from social aspects of daily life.
A study researching the causes of nightmares focuses on patients who have sleep apnea. The study was conducted to determine whether or not nightmares may be caused by sleep apnea, or being unable to breathe. In the nineteenth century, authors believed that nightmares were caused by not having enough oxygen, therefore it was believed that those with sleep apnea had more frequent nightmares than those without it. The results actually showed that healthy people have more nightmares than sleep apnea patients.
Another study supports the hypothesis. In this study, 48 patients (aged 20–85 yrs) with obstructive airways disease (OAD), including 21 with and 27 without asthma, were compared with 149 sex- and age-matched controls without respiratory disease. OAD subjects with asthma reported approximately 3 times as many nightmares as controls or OAD subjects without asthma. The evolutionary purpose of nightmares then could be a mechanism to awaken a person who is in danger.

Lucid-dreaming advocate Stephen LaBerge has outlined a possible reason for how dreams are formulated and why nightmares occur. To LaBerge, a dream starts with an individual thought or scene, such as walking down a dimly lit street. Since dreams are not predetermined, the brain responds to the situation by either thinking a good thought or a bad thought, and the dream framework follows from there. If bad thoughts in a dream are more prominent than good thoughts, the dream may proceed to be a nightmare.

There is a view, possibly featured in the story &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, that eating cheese before sleep can cause nightmares, but there is little scientific evidence for this. A single, biased study conducted by the British Cheese Board in 2005 argued that consuming cheese could trigger more vivid dreams, but this study was not backed up with sufficient research, and contradicts existing studies which found that consuming dairy products is associated with better overall sleep quality.

Severe nightmares are also likely to occur when a person has a fever; these nightmares are often referred to as fever dreams. 

Recent research has shown that frequent nightmares may precede the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease and dementia.

==Treatment==
Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung seemed to have shared a belief that people frequently distressed by nightmares could be re-experiencing some stressful event from the past. Both perspectives on dreams suggest that therapy can provide relief from the dilemma of the nightmarish experience.

Halliday (1987) grouped treatment techniques into four classes. Direct nightmare interventions that combine compatible techniques from one or more of these classes may enhance overall treatment effectiveness:

* Analytic and cathartic techniques
* Storyline alteration procedures
* Face-and-conquer approaches
* Desensitization and related behavioral techniques

===Post-traumatic stress disorder===
Recurring post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) nightmares in which traumas are re-experienced respond well to a technique called imagery rehearsal. This involves dreamers coming up with alternative, mastery outcomes to the nightmares, mentally rehearsing those outcomes while awake and then reminding themselves at bedtime that they wish these alternative outcomes should the nightmares recur. Research has found that this technique not only reduces the occurrence of nightmares and insomnia but also improves other daytime PTSD symptoms. The most common variations of imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT) &quot;relate to the number of sessions, duration of treatment, and the degree to which exposure therapy is included in the protocol&quot;.

===Medication===
* Prazosin (alpha-1 blocker) appears useful in decreasing the number of nightmares and the distress caused by them in people with PTSD.
* Risperidone (atypical antipsychotic) at a dosage of 2 mg per day, has been shown in a case report to lead to the remission of nightmares on the first night.
* Trazodone (antidepressant) has been shown in a case report to treat nightmares associated with depressed patients.

Trials have included hydrocortisone, gabapentin, paroxetine, tetrahydrocannabinol, eszopiclone, Sodium oxybate, and carvedilol.

<text>Nadsat is a fictional register or argot used by the teenage gang members in Anthony Burgess&#x27;s dystopian novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. Burgess was a linguist and he used this background to depict his characters as speaking a form of Russian-influenced English. The name comes from the Russian suffix equivalent of &quot;-teen&quot; as in &quot;thirteen&quot; (, ). Nadsat was also used in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film adaptation of the book.

== Description ==

Nadsat is a mode of speech used by the &quot;nadsat&quot;, members of the teen subculture in the novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. The narrator and protagonist of the book, Alex, uses it in first-person style to relate the story to the reader. He also uses it to communicate with other characters in the novel, such as his &quot;droogs&quot;, parents, victims and any authority-figures with whom he comes in contact. As with many speakers of non-standard varieties of English, Alex is capable of speaking standard English when he wants to. It is not a written language: the sense that readers get is of a transcription of vernacular speech.

Nadsat is English with some borrowed words from Russian. It also contains influences from Cockney rhyming slang, the King James Bible, German, some words of unclear origin and some that Burgess invented. The word &quot;nadsat&quot; is the suffix of Russian numerals from 11 to 19 (). The suffix is an almost exact linguistic parallel to the English &quot;-teen&quot; and is derived from , meaning &#x27;on&#x27; and a shortened form of , the number ten. &quot;Droog&quot; is derived from the Welsh word , meaning &#x27;bad&#x27;, &#x27;naughty&#x27; or &#x27;evil&#x27; and the Russian word , meaning a &#x27;close friend&#x27;. Some of the words are almost childish plays on English words, such as (&#x27;egg&#x27;) and (&#x27;apology&#x27;), as well as regular English slang &quot;sod&quot; and &quot;snuff it&quot;. The word &quot;like&quot; and the expression &quot;the old&quot; are often used as fillers or discourse markers.

The original 1991 translation of Burgess&#x27;s book into Russian solved the problem of how to illustrate the Nadsat words by using transliterated, slang English words in places where Burgess had used Russian onesfor example, &quot;droogs&quot; became (). Borrowed English words with Russian inflection were widely used in Russian slang, especially among Russian hippies in the 1970s–1980s. 

== Function ==
Burgess was a polyglot who loved language in all its forms. However, he realized that if he used contemporary slang, the novel would very quickly become dated, owing to the way in which teenage language is constantly changing. He was therefore forced to invent his own vocabulary, and to set the book in an imaginary future. Burgess was later to point out that, ironically, some of the Nadsat words in the book had been appropriated by American teenagers, &quot;and thus shoved [his] future into the discardable past.&quot; His use of Nadsat was pragmatic; he needed his narrator to have a unique voice that would remain ageless, while reinforcing Alex&#x27;s indifference to his society&#x27;s norms, and to suggest that youth subculture was independent from the rest of society. In &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, Alex&#x27;s interrogators describe the source of his argot as &quot;subliminal penetration&quot;.

== Russian influences ==
Russian influences play the biggest role in Nadsat. Most of those Russian-influenced words are slightly anglicized loan-words, often maintaining the original Russian pronunciation. One example is the Russian word , which is anglicized to , meaning &#x27;people&#x27;. Another Russian word is which is anglicized to , meaning &#x27;grandmother&#x27;, &#x27;old woman&#x27;. Some of the anglicised words are truncated, for example from , &#x27;to understand&#x27;, or otherwise shortened, for example from , &#x27;person, man&#x27; (though the anglicized word is also used in the book).

A further means of constructing Nadsat words is the employment of homophones (known as folk etymology). For example, one Nadsat term which may seem like an English composition, , actually stems from the Russian word for &#x27;good&#x27;; , which sounds similar to . In this same manner many of the Russian loan-words become an English–Russian hybrid, with Russian origins, and English spellings and pronunciations. A further example is the Russian word for &#x27;head&#x27;, , which sounds similar to &quot;Gulliver&quot; known from &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;; became the Nadsat expression for the concept &#x27;head&#x27;.

Many of Burgess&#x27;s loan-words, such as (&#x27;girl&#x27;) and (&#x27;friend&#x27;), maintain both their relative spelling and meaning over the course of translation.

== Other influences ==
Additional words were borrowed from other languages: A (possibly Saudi-owned) hotel was named &#x27;Al Idayyin, an Arabic-sounding variant on &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; Hotel chain, while also alluding to the name Aladdin.

== Word derivation by common techniques ==
Nadsat&#x27;s English slang is constructed with common language-formation techniques. Some words are blended, others clipped or compounded. In Nadsat language a &#x27;fit of laughter&#x27; becomes a (shortened version of &quot;guffawing&quot;); a &#x27;skeleton key&#x27; becomes a (&#x27;many keys&#x27;); and the &#x27;state jail&#x27; is blended to the , which has the double entendre , so that its prisoners got there by a staged act of corruption, as revenge by the state, an interpretation that would fit smoothly into the storyline. Many common English slang terms are simply shortened. A &quot;cancer stick&quot;, which is (or was) a common English-slang expression for a cigarette, is shortened to a .

== Rhyming slang ==
This feature of Nadsat is derived from Cockney.
; = &#x27;chaplain&#x27;: &quot;Chaplain&quot; and &quot;Chaplin&quot; (from Charlie Chaplin) are homophones. Using the principles of rhyming slang Burgess uses &quot;Charlie Chaplin&quot; as a synonym for &#x27;chaplain&#x27; and shortens it to .
; = &#x27;money&#x27;: rhymes with &quot;bread and butter&quot;, a wilful alteration of &quot;bread and honey&quot; &#x27;money&#x27;.
; = &#x27;money&#x27;: Another colloquial expression used to describe the concept &#x27;money&#x27; is . rhymes with &quot;pretty polly&quot;, which is the name of an English folk song and in the world of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; becomes a new expression for &#x27;money&#x27;.
; = &#x27;corny&#x27;
; = &#x27;fun&#x27;: &quot;Fun&quot; means &#x27;gang violence&#x27; in the context of the story.
The language was also used in the film made by Kubrick.

<doc id="46265" wikidata="Q259563" url="?curid=46265" title="Atbash">
<text>Atbash (; also transliterated Atbaš) is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher originally used to encrypt the Hebrew alphabet. It can be modified for use with any known writing system with a standard collating order.

== Encryption ==
The Atbash cipher is a particular type of monoalphabetic cipher formed by taking the alphabet (or abjad, syllabary, etc.) and mapping it to its reverse, so that the first letter becomes the last letter, the second letter becomes the second to last letter, and so on. For example, the Hebrew alphabet would work like this:
Because there is only one way to perform this, the Atbash cipher provides no communications security, as it lacks any sort of key. If multiple collating orders are available, which one was used in encryption can be used as a key, but this does not provide significantly more security, considering that only a few letters can give away which one was used.

== History ==

The name derives from the first, last, second, and second to last Hebrew letters (Aleph–Taw–Bet–Shin).

The Atbash cipher for the modern Hebrew alphabet would be:

By shifting the correlation one space to the left or the right, one may derive a variant Batgash (named for Bet–Taw–Gimel–Shin) or Ashbar (for Aleph–Shin–Bet–Reish). Either alternative mapping leaves one letter unsubstituted; respectively Aleph and Taw.

=== In the Bible===
Several biblical words are described by commentators as being examples of Atbash:
* Jeremiah 25:26 – &quot;The king of &quot;Sheshach&quot; shall drink after them&quot; – Sheshach meaning Babylon in Atbash ( &quot;bbl&quot; → &quot;ššk&quot;).
* Jeremiah 51:1 – &quot;Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against the inhabitants of &quot;Lev-kamai&quot;, a destroying wind.&quot; – Lev-kamai meaning Chaldeans ( &quot;kśdym&quot; → &quot;lbqmy&quot;).
* Jeremiah 51:41 – &quot;How has &quot;Sheshach&quot; been captured! and the praise of the whole earth taken! How has Babylon become a curse among the nations!&quot; – Sheshach meaning Babylon ( &quot;bbl&quot; → &quot;ššk&quot;).
Regarding a potential Atbash switch of a single letter:
* - &quot;Any place &quot;I&quot; will mention My name&quot; () → &quot;Any place &quot;you&quot; will mention My name&quot; () (a → t), according to Yom Tov Asevilli

== Relationship to the affine cipher ==
The Atbash cipher can be seen as a special case of the affine cipher.

Under the standard affine convention, an alphabet of &quot;m&quot; letters is mapped to the numbers (The Hebrew alphabet has and the standard Latin alphabet has The Atbash cipher may then be enciphered and deciphered using the encryption function for an affine cipher by setting 

: formula_1

This may be simplified to
:formula_2

If, instead, the &quot;m&quot; letters of the alphabet are mapped to then the encryption and decryption function for the Atbash cipher becomes
: formula_3

<text>Encaustic painting, also known as hot wax painting, is a form of painting that involves a heated wax medium to which colored pigments have been added. The molten mix is applied to a surface—usually prepared wood, though canvas and other materials are sometimes used. The simplest encaustic medium could be made by adding pigments to wax, though recipes most commonly consist of beeswax and damar resin, potentially with other ingredients. For pigmentation, dried powdered pigments can be used, though some artists use pigmented wax, inks, oil paints or other forms of pigmentation.

Metal tools and special brushes can be used to shape the medium as it cools. Also, heated metal tools, including spatulas, knives and scrapers, can be used to manipulate the medium after it has cooled onto the surface. Additionally, heat lamps, torches, heat guns, and other methods of applying heat are used by encaustic artists to fuse and bind the medium. Because encaustic medium is thermally malleable, the medium can be also sculpted, and materials can be encased, collaged or layered into the medium.

A completely unrelated type of &quot;encaustic painting&quot;, not involving wax at all, is found in British ceramics, after Josiah Wedgwood devised and patented the technique in 1769. This was a mixture of ceramic slip and overglaze &quot;enamel&quot; paints used to imitate ancient Greek vase painting, and given a light second firing. Usually the vessel was black and painted in the red of red-figure painting. The technique was copied by other British potteries. Encaustic tiles are not painted at all, but effectively inlaid with contrasting colours of clay for a polychrome pattern.

== History ==
The word encaustic originates from , which means &quot;burning in&quot;, from &quot;en&quot;, &quot;in&quot; and &quot;kaiein&quot;, &quot;to burn&quot;, and this element of heat is necessary for a painting to be called encaustic.
Encaustice or Encaustike (ἐγκαυστική) was the art of painting by burning in the colours.

The wax encaustic painting technique was described by the Roman scholar Pliny the Elder in his &quot;Natural History&quot; from the 1st Century AD. The oldest surviving encaustic panel paintings are the Romano-Egyptian Fayum mummy portraits from Egypt, around 100–300 AD, but it was a very common technique in ancient Greek and Roman painting. It continued to be used in early Byzantine icons but was effectively abandoned in the Western Church.

Kut-kut, a lost art of the Philippines, employs sgraffito and encaustic techniques. It was practiced by the indigenous tribe of Samar island around 1600 to 1800. Artists in the Mexican muralism movement, such as Diego Rivera, Fernando Leal (artist) and Jean Charlot sometimes used encaustic painting. The Belgian artist James Ensor also experimented with encaustic.
In the 20th century, painter Fritz Faiss (1905–1981), a student of Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky at the Bauhaus, together with Dr. Hans Schmid, rediscovered the so-called Punic wax technique of encaustic painting. Faiss held two German patents related to the preparation of waxes for encaustic painting. One covered a method for treating beeswax so that its melting point was raised from . This occurred after boiling the wax in a solution of sea water and soda three successive times. The resulting harder wax is the same as the Punic wax referred to in ancient Greek writings on encaustic painting. Other 20th-century North American artists, including Jasper Johns, Tony Scherman, Mark Perlman, John Shaw and Fernando Leal Audirac, have used encaustic techniques.

Encaustic art has seen a resurgence in popularity since the 1990s, with artists using electric irons, hotplates and heated styli on different surfaces, including card, paper, and even pottery, and wax crayons started to be used as an inexpensive and accessible medium for crafting and art education. The iron makes producing a variety of artistic patterns easier. The medium is not limited to just simple designs; it can also be used to create complex paintings, just as in other media such as oil and acrylic. Although technically difficult to master, attractions of this medium for contemporary artists are its dimensional quality and luminous color.

<doc id="46270" wikidata="Q17155125" url="?curid=46270" title="New materials in 20th-century art">
<text>New materials in 20th-century art were introduced to art making from the very beginning of the century. The introduction of new materials (and techniques) and heretofore non-art materials helped drive change in art during the 20th century. Traditional materials and techniques were not necessarily displaced in the 20th century. Rather, they functioned alongside innovations that came with the 20th century. Such mainstays as oil-on-canvas painting, and sculpting in traditional materials continued right through the 20th century into the 21st century. Furthermore, even &quot;traditional&quot; materials were greatly expanded in the course of the 20th century. The number of pigments available to artists (painters, primarily) has increased both in quantity and quality, by most reckoning. New formulations for traditional materials especially the commercial availability of acrylic paint have become widely used, introducing initial issues over their stability and longevity.

Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Kurt Schwitters, Joseph Cornell and others incorporated paper collage and mixed drawing (materials) with paint to fashion their work. Both Picasso and Marcel Duchamp pioneered the use of found objects as material for paintings and sculpture during the 1910s. In the 1940s Jackson Pollock pioneered the use of housepaint, silver and aluminum paint, duco, and various objects for use in his paintings. In the 1950s Robert Rauschenberg included 3-D elements like tires and stuffed animals
as well as using discarded materials like crushed or flattened cardboard boxes. Yves Klein incorporated live nude models and a symphony orchestra in his performance pieces of his paintings. John Chamberlain used crushed auto parts for sculpture. In the 1960s Pop artists Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, Tom Wesselmann and Roy Lichtenstein made art from commercial products, or art that resembled commercial products like television sets, soup cans, brillo boxes, comic books, household furniture and restaurant items among other things. Edward Kienholz made replicas of actual environments both domestic and commercial, while George Segal made life-size plaster figures in settings using real objects and props. Dan Flavin used electric fluorescent lights and ballasts to create sculpture. In the 1970s Frank Stella introduced honeycombed aluminum and glitter. In the 1980s Julian Schnabel made &quot;plate paintings&quot; with broken crockery stuck to the surface and then painted over, Anselm Kiefer and Richard Long used mud, soil or tar in their works. In the 1960s and again in the 1990s artists used excrement notably - the Italian artist Piero Manzoni in 1961 and the British artist Chris Ofili who specialized in using elephant dung in the 1990s. Tracey Emin included her bed, entitled My Bed, in 1999.

Some innovations concerning materials used in art merely function in a supportive way, and other innovative materials are much more conspicuous. Frank Stella&#x27;s use of honeycombed aluminum served as a lightweight and strong and very configurable support for imagery. In the sculpture entitled &quot;Monogram,&quot; by Robert Rauschenberg, an angora goat assumes a position of central importance.

==Early 20th century==

The advent of Modernism and Modern Art in the first decades of the 20th century inspired artists to test and transcend the boundaries and the limitations of the traditional and conventional forms of art making in search of newer forms and in search of new materials. The innovations of painters like Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and the French Symbolists provided essential inspiration for the development of modern art by the younger generation of artists in Paris and elsewhere in Europe. Henri Matisse and other young artists revolutionized the Paris art world with &quot;wild&quot;, multi-colored, expressive, paintings that the critics called Fauvism. Henri Rousseau, Pablo Picasso, Giorgio de Chirico, Amedeo Modigliani, Marc Chagall, Robert Delaunay and scores of young artists in Paris made their first modern paintings venturing toward abstraction and other new ways of formulating figurative, still-life and landscape imagery.

===1900s===
During the first decade of the 20th century modern art developed simultaneously in several different areas in Europe (France, England, Scandinavia, Russia, Germany, Italy), and in the United States. Artists began to formulate different directions of modern art, seemingly unrelated to one another.

In printmaking, the linocut was invented by the artists of Die Brücke in Germany between 1905 and 1913. At first they described their prints as woodcuts, which sounded more respectable. The technique remains popular as a very simple method of printmaking, even suitable for use in schools.

===1910s===

====Cubism====

Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Juan Gris and other cubist artists introduced new elements and materials like newspaper clippings, fabric, and sheet music into their paintings. Eventually the movement was called Synthetic Cubism developed between 1912 and 1919. Synthetic cubism is characterized by works with different textures, surfaces, collage elements, papier collé and a large variety of subject matter. It was the beginning of collage materials being introduced as an important ingredient of fine art work by the avant-garde.

Considered the first work of this new style was Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Still Life with Chair-caning&quot; (1911–1912), which includes oil cloth that was printed to look like chair-caning pasted onto an oval canvas, with text; and rope framing the whole picture. At the upper left are the letters &quot;JOU&quot;, which appear in many cubist paintings and refers to the newspaper titled &quot;Le Journal&quot;.

====Dada====
The Dada movement began during World War I as a protest against the madness and violence of war. Applying shock tactics and anarchy to art the Dadaists pioneered the use of new artistic techniques such as collage, photomontage readymades and the use of found objects. Artists like Marcel Duchamp, Hannah Höch, Kurt Schwitters, Francis Picabia, Man Ray and others incorporated into their work random everyday objects often combined with more conventional artist materials. They included photographs, panes of glass, picture frames, eyeglasses, boxes, newspapers, magazines, ticket stubs, metal pipes, bulbs, bottle racks, urinals, bicycle wheels and other objects. Marcel Duchamp created &quot;The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even,&quot; working on the piece from 1915 to 1923. He made the work on two panes of glass; with materials such as lead foil, fuse wire, and dust.

===1920s===

====Surrealism====
During the 1930s Surrealist artist Méret Oppenheim created sexually charged erotic pieces. Oppenheim&#x27;s best known piece is &quot;Object (Le Déjeuner en fourrure)&quot; (1936). The sculpture consists of a teacup, saucer and spoon that the artist covered with fur from a Chinese gazelle. It is displayed at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

====American Modernism====
==Mid 20th century==

===1950s===
Robert Rauschenberg began to create what became known as his Combine paintings in the early 1950s.

===1960s===
In 1960 Yves Klein incorporated live nude models and a symphony orchestra in his performance pieces of his paintings. Klein also made use of Photomontage in the famous pseudo-performance picture of himself diving off a wall onto a Paris street &quot;Le Saut dans le Vide&quot; (Leap into the Void. In the 1960s John Chamberlain continued using crushed auto parts for sculpture. Dan Flavin used electric fluorescent lights and ballasts to create his sculpture. In May 1961 Italian artist Piero Manzoni used his own excrement, selling it in cans titled &quot;Artist&#x27;s Shit&quot; (&quot;Merda d&#x27;Artista&quot;). However the contents of the cans remain a much-disputed enigma, since opening them would destroy the value of the artwork. Various theories about the contents have been proposed, including speculation that it is plaster.

<doc id="46276" wikidata="Q47502" url="?curid=46276" title="Mother's Day">
<text>Mother&#x27;s Day is a celebration honoring the mother of the family or individual, as well as motherhood, maternal bonds, and the influence of mothers in society. It is celebrated on different days in many parts of the world, most commonly in March or May. It complements similar celebrations honoring family members, such as Father&#x27;s Day, Siblings Day, and Grandparents&#x27; Day.

In the 19th century in the British Isles, &quot;Mothering Sunday&quot; was celebrated on the fourth Sunday in Lent, a practice which continues in the present day. On this day, clerics and curates were encouraged to use the time at their disposal to visit their original mother churches.

While other countries also have a multi-century history of a day to celebrate mothers, the modern American version of the holiday began in the United States in the early 20th century at the initiative of Anna Jarvis. She organized the first Mother&#x27;s Day service of worship and celebration at Andrews Methodist Episcopal Church in Grafton, West Virginia, which serves as the International Mother&#x27;s Day Shrine today. It is not directly related to the many traditional celebrations of mothers and motherhood that have existed throughout the world over thousands of years, such as the Greek cult to Cybele, the mother deity Rhea, the Roman festival of Hilaria, or the other Christian ecclesiastical Mothering Sunday celebration (associated with the image of Mother Church). However, in some countries, Mother&#x27;s Day is still synonymous with these older traditions.

The American version of Mother&#x27;s Day has been criticized for having become too commercialized. Jarvis herself, who began the celebration as a liturgical observance, regretted this commercialism and expressed that this was never her intention. In response, Constance Adelaide Smith successfully advocated for Mothering Sunday as a commemoration of a broader definition of motherhood in many other parts of the English-speaking world.

==Establishment of holiday==
The modern holiday was first celebrated in 1907, when Anna Jarvis held the first Mother&#x27;s Day service of worship at Andrews Methodist Episcopal Church in Grafton, West Virginia. Andrew&#x27;s Methodist Church now holds the International Mother&#x27;s Day Shrine. Her campaign to make Mother&#x27;s Day a recognized holiday in the United States began in 1905, the year her mother, Ann Reeves Jarvis, died. Ann Jarvis had been a peace activist who cared for wounded soldiers on both sides of the American Civil War, and created Mother&#x27;s Day Work Clubs to address public health issues. She and another peace activist and suffragist, Julia Ward Howe, had been urging for the creation of a &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day For Peace&quot; where mothers would ask that their husbands and sons were no longer killed in wars. Forty years before it became an official holiday, Ward Howe had made her Mother&#x27;s Day Proclamation in 1870, which called upon mothers of all nationalities to band together to promote the &quot;amicable settlement of international questions, the great and general interests of peace.&quot; Anna Jarvis wanted to honor this and to set aside a day to honor all mothers because she believed a mother is &quot;the person who has done more for you than anyone in the world&quot;.

In 1908, the U.S. Congress rejected a proposal to make Mother&#x27;s Day an official holiday, joking that they would also have to proclaim a &quot;Mother-in-law&#x27;s Day&quot;. However, owing to the efforts of Anna Jarvis, by 1911 all U.S. states observed the holiday, with some of them officially recognizing Mother&#x27;s Day as a local holiday (the first being West Virginia, Jarvis&#x27;s home state, in 1910). In 1914, Woodrow Wilson signed a proclamation designating Mother&#x27;s Day, held on the second Sunday in May, as a national holiday to honor mothers.

Although Jarvis, who started Mother&#x27;s Day as a liturgical service, was successful in founding the celebration, she became resentful of the commercialization of the holiday, and it became associated with the phrase &quot;Hallmark holiday&quot;. By the early 1920s, Hallmark Cards and other companies had started selling Mother&#x27;s Day cards. Jarvis believed that the companies had misinterpreted and exploited the idea of Mother&#x27;s Day, and that the emphasis of the holiday was on sentiment, not profit. As a result, she organized boycotts of Mother&#x27;s Day and threatened to issue lawsuits against the companies involved. Jarvis argued that people should appreciate and honor their mothers through handwritten letters expressing their love and gratitude, instead of buying gifts and pre-made cards. Jarvis protested at a candy makers&#x27; convention in Philadelphia in 1923, and at a meeting of American War Mothers in 1925. By this time, carnations had become associated with Mother&#x27;s Day, and the selling of carnations by the American War Mothers to raise money angered Jarvis, who was arrested for disturbing the peace.

In Britain, Constance Adelaide Smith was inspired to advocate for Mothering Sunday, an already-existing Christian ecclesiastical celebration in which the faithful visit the church in which they received the sacrament of baptism, as an equivalent celebration. She referred to medieval traditions of celebrating Mother Church, &#x27;mothers of earthly homes&#x27;, Mary, mother of Jesus, and Mother Nature. Her efforts were successful in the British Isles and other parts of the English-speaking world.

== Spelling ==

In 1912, Anna Jarvis trademarked the phrase &quot;Second Sunday in May, Mother&#x27;s Day, Anna Jarvis, Founder&quot;, and created the Mother&#x27;s Day International Association. She specifically noted that &quot;Mother&#x27;s&quot; should &quot;be a singular possessive, for each family to honor its own mother, not a plural possessive commemorating all mothers in the world.&quot; This is also the spelling used by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson in his 1914 presidential proclamation, by the U.S. Congress in relevant bills, and by various U.S. presidents in their proclamations concerning Mother&#x27;s Day.

==Dates around the world==
While the United States holiday was adopted by some other countries, existing celebrations, held on different dates, honoring motherhood have become described as &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot;, such as Mothering Sunday in the United Kingdom or, in Greece, the Eastern Orthodox celebration of the presentation of Jesus Christ to the temple (2 February of Julian Calendar). Both the secular and religious Mother Day are present in Greece. Mothering Sunday is often referred to as &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot; even though it is an unrelated celebration.

In some countries, the date adopted is one significant to the majority religion, such as Virgin Mary Day in Catholic countries. Other countries selected a date with historical significance. For example, Bolivia&#x27;s Mother&#x27;s Day is a fixed date, commemorating a battle in which women participated to defend their children.

Some countries, such as Russia, celebrate International Women&#x27;s Day instead of Mother&#x27;s Day or simply celebrate both holidays, which is the custom in Ukraine. Kyrgyzstan has recently introduced Mother&#x27;s Day, but &quot;year on year International Women&#x27;s Day is certainly increasing in status&quot;.

==International history and tradition==


In most countries, Mother&#x27;s Day is an observance derived from the holiday as it has evolved in the United States, promoted by companies who saw benefit in making it popular. As adopted by other countries and cultures, the holiday has different meanings, is associated with different events (religious, historical or legendary), and is celebrated on different dates.

In some cases, countries already had existing celebrations honoring motherhood, and their celebrations then adopted several external characteristics from the US holiday, such as giving carnations and other presents to one&#x27;s mother.

The extent of the celebrations varies greatly. In some countries, it is potentially offensive to one&#x27;s mother not to mark Mother&#x27;s Day. In others, it is a little-known festival celebrated mainly by immigrants, or covered by the media as a taste of foreign culture.

===Religion===
In certain traditional branches of Christianity, the holiday is strongly associated with revering the Virgin Mary. In some Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican homes, families have a special shrine on their home altar devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary. In many Eastern Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, a special prayer service is held in honor of the Theotokos Virgin Mary.

In Islam, special attention is paid to mothers. The Prophet Muhammad said in this regard: ″The Paradise is beneath mother&#x27;s feet″
Also there is no concept of Mother&#x27;s Day in Islam, but the Quran teaches that children should give priority to loving their mother over their father.&lt;br&gt;
Quran the holy book of Muslims has mentioned the status and respect of Mother in many verses: Surah Al-Isra, verse 23, Al-Ahqaf, verse 15, Luqman, verse 14 and Al-Baqarah, verse 233, is one of them.

In Hindu tradition, Mother&#x27;s Day is called &quot;Mata Tirtha Aunshi&quot; or &quot;Mother Pilgrimage fortnight&quot;, and is celebrated in countries with a Hindu population, especially in Nepal, where mothers are honored with special foods. The holiday is observed on the new moon day in the month of Baisakh, i.e., April/May. This celebration is based on the Hindu religion and it pre-dates the creation of the US-inspired celebration by at least a few centuries.

In Buddhism, the festival of Ullambana is derived from the story of Maudgalyayana and his mother.

===By country===
====Albania====
In Albania, as in a number of Balkan and Eastern European countries, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on 8 March, in conjunction with International Women&#x27;s Day.

====Arab world====
Mother&#x27;s Day in most Arab countries is celebrated on 21 March. It was introduced in Egypt by journalist Mustafa Amin and was first celebrated in 1956. The practice has since been adopted by other Arab countries.

====Argentina====
In Argentina, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on the third Sunday of October. The holiday was originally celebrated on 11 October, the old liturgical date for the celebration of the Maternity of the Blessed Virgin Mary but after the Second Vatican Council, which moved the Virgin Mary festivity to 1 January, the Mother&#x27;s Day started to be celebrated the third Sunday of October because of popular tradition. Argentina is the only country in the world that celebrates Mother&#x27;s Day on this date.

====Armenia====
In Armenia, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on 8 March, and on 7 April as Maternity and Beauty Day.

====Australia====
In Australia, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on the second Sunday in May. Australia celebrated Mother’s Day for the first time in 1910 with special church services, however, it was not popularly observed until the 1920s. Because it is autumn in Australia for Mother’s Day, and carnations are a spring flower, white chrysanthemums are the traditional Mother’s Day flower in Australia.

====Bangladesh====
There is no historical tradition of celebrating Mother&#x27;s Day in Bangladesh (Bangla: মা/আম্মু দিবস, &quot;Ma/ammu dibosh&quot;), and it has become popular in the country due to western influences. It is celebrated on the second Sunday of May and is not a public holiday. Mother&#x27;s Day was not very popular and in recent times it has been spread more widely by the Millennial and Generation Z communities across the country through social media. Although many religious families do not celebrate it, it is more widespread than ever before. There is a popular phrase used by many parents, including mothers, which is &quot;Every day is Father&#x27;s/Mother&#x27;s Day so you will love your parents every day.&quot; Most people just wish or pray for their mother, but many from big cities like Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Sylhet, Barishal, Narayangonj, Bogura etc. go to restaurants to celebrate, many also cut cakes. Many others cut cakes at home or order meals online. Some children may give small gifts to their mothers.

====Belarus====
Belarus celebrates Mother&#x27;s Day on 14 October. Like other ex-Communist republics, Belarus used to celebrate only International Women&#x27;s Day on 8 March. Mother&#x27;s Day in Belarus was officially established by the Belarusian government, and it was celebrated for the first time in 1996. The celebration of the Virgin Mary (the holiday of Protection of the Holy Mother of God) is celebrated on the same day.

====Bhutan====
Mother&#x27;s Day in Bhutan is celebrated on 8 May. It was introduced in Bhutan by the Tourism Council of Bhutan.

====Belgium====
In Belgium, Mother&#x27;s Day (&quot;Moederdag&quot; or &quot;Moederkesdag&quot; in Dutch and &quot;Fête des Mères&quot; in French) is celebrated on the second Sunday of May. In the week before this holiday children make little presents at primary school, which they give to their mothers in the early morning of Mother&#x27;s Day. Typically, the father will buy croissants and other sweet breads and pastries and bring these to the mother while she is still in bed – the beginning of a day of pampering for the mother. There are also many people who celebrate Mother&#x27;s Day on 15 August instead; these are mostly people around Antwerp, who consider that day (Assumption) the classical Mother&#x27;s Day and the observance in May an invention for commercial reasons. It was originally established on that day as the result of a campaign by Frans Van Kuyck, a painter and Alderman from Antwerp.

====Bolivia====
In Bolivia, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on 27 May. El &quot;Día de la Madre Boliviana&quot; was passed into law on 8 November 1927, during the presidency of Hernando Siles Reyes. The date commemorates the Battle of La Coronilla, which took place on 27 May 1812, during the Bolivian War of Independence, in what is now the city of Cochabamba. In this battle, women fighting for the country&#x27;s independence were slaughtered by the Spanish army. It is not a public holiday, but all schools hold activities and festivities throughout the day.

====Brazil====
In Brazil, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on the second Sunday of May. The first Mother&#x27;s Day in Brazil was promoted by Associação Cristã de Moços de Porto Alegre (Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association of Porto Alegre) on 12 May 1918. In 1932, then President Getúlio Vargas made the second Sunday of May the official date for Mother&#x27;s Day. In 1947, Archbishop Jaime de Barros Câmara, Cardinal-Archbishop of Rio de Janeiro, decided that this holiday would also be included in the official calendar of the Catholic Church.

Mother&#x27;s Day is not an official holiday (see Public holidays in Brazil), but it is widely observed and typically involves spending time with and giving gifts to one&#x27;s mother. Because of this, it is considered one of the celebrations most related to consumerism in the country, second only to Christmas Day as the most commercially lucrative holiday.

====Canada====
:&quot;See also Other observances in Canada&quot;

Mother&#x27;s Day in Canada is celebrated on the second Sunday in May (it is not a public holiday or bank holiday), and typically involves small celebrations and gift-giving to one&#x27;s mother, grandmother, or other important female figures in one&#x27;s family. Celebratory practices are very similar to those of other western nations. A Québécois tradition is for Québécois men to offer roses or other flowers to the women.

====China====
Mother&#x27;s Day is becoming more popular in China. Carnations are a very popular Mother&#x27;s Day gift and the most sold flowers in relation to the day. In 1997 Mother&#x27;s Day was set as the day to help poor mothers and to remind people of the poor mothers in rural areas such as China&#x27;s western region. In the People&#x27;s Daily, the Chinese government&#x27;s official newspaper, an article explained that &quot;despite originating in the United States, people in China accept the holiday without hesitation because it is in line with the country&#x27;s traditional ethics – respect for the elderly and filial piety towards parents.&quot;

In recent years, the Communist Party member Li Hanqiu began to advocate for the official adoption of Mother&#x27;s Day in memory of Meng Mu, the mother of Mèng Zǐ. He formed a non-governmental organization called &quot;Chinese Mothers&#x27; Festival Promotion Society&quot;, with the support of 100 Confucian scholars and lecturers of ethics. Li and the Society want to replace the Western-style gift of carnations with lilies, which, in ancient times, were planted by Chinese mothers when children left home. Mother&#x27;s Day remains an unofficial festival, except in a small number of cities.

====Costa Rica====
In Costa Rica, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on 15 August. In 1927, at the Nicolás Ulloa School in Heredia, Evangelina Solís founded an annual event that would celebrate the mothers of the students. It was held around the time of the distribution of midterm notes, in July. Evangelina&#x27;s reasoning was that mothers should be congratulated for their children&#x27;s successes. The event gained national traction and was enacted into law in 1932. The final date of 15 August was chosen as it coincided with the celebration of Assumption of Mary, mother of Jesus.

====Czech Republic====
In the Czech Republic, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated every second Sunday in May. It started in former Czechoslovakia in 1923. The promoter of this celebration was Alice Masaryková. After World War II communists replaced Mother&#x27;s Day with International Woman&#x27;s Day, celebrated on 8 March. The former Czechoslovakia celebrated Women&#x27;s Day until the Velvet Revolution in 1989. After the split of the country in 1993, the Czech Republic started celebrating Mother&#x27;s Day again.

====Egypt====
Mother&#x27;s Day in Egypt is celebrated on 21 March, the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere. It was introduced in Egypt by journalist Mustafa Amin in his book &quot;Smiling America&quot; (1943). The idea was overlooked at the time. Later Amin heard the story of a widowed mother who devoted her whole life to raising her son until he became a doctor. The son then married and left without showing any gratitude to his mother. Hearing this, Amin became motivated to promote &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot;. The idea was first ridiculed by president Gamal Abdel Nasser but he eventually accepted it and Mother&#x27;s Day was first celebrated on 21 March 1956. The practice has since been copied by other Arab countries.

When Mustafa Amin was arrested and imprisoned, the government changed the name of the holiday from &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot; to &quot;Family Day&quot;, but they reverted the name after Egyptian mothers wrote to complain. Celebrations continued to be held on the same date and classic songs celebrating mothers remain famous to this day.

==== Ethiopia ====
Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated for three days in Ethiopia, after the end of the rainy season. It comes in mid-fall where people enjoy a three-day feast called &quot;Antrosht&quot;.

For the feast, ingredients will be brought by the children for a traditional hash recipe. The ingredients are divided along genders, with girls bringing spices, vegetables, cheese and butter, while the boys bring a lamb or bull. The mother hands out the hash to the family.

A celebration takes place after the meal. The mothers and daughters anoint themselves using butter on their faces and chests. While honoring their family and heroes, men sing songs.

====Estonia====
In Estonia, Mother&#x27;s Day (&quot;emadepäev&quot; in Estonian) is celebrated on the second Sunday of May. It is recognized nationally, but is not a public holiday.

====Finland====
In Finland, Mother&#x27;s Day (&quot;äitienpäivä&quot; in Finnish) is celebrated on the second Sunday of May. It is recognized nationally and is a public holiday. It is usually celebrated at homes where children or grandchildren bring Mother&#x27;s day cards that they have drawn to their mothers and grandmothers. Usually, some food, coffee and cakes are served for guests. Grown up children visit their parents&#x27; homes and bring traditionally Mother&#x27;s day roses or other flowers accompanied by a Mother&#x27;s day card.
The president of Finland honors with medals every year some mothers who have done something exceptional and positive during the year.

====France====
In France, amidst alarm at the low birth rate, there were attempts in 1896 and 1904 to create a national celebration honoring the mothers of large families. In 1906 ten mothers who had nine children each were given an award recognising &quot;High Maternal Merit&quot; (&quot;Haut mérite maternel&quot;). American World War I soldiers fighting in France popularized the US Mother&#x27;s Day holiday created by Anna Jarvis. They sent so much mail back to their country for Mother&#x27;s Day that the Union Franco-Américaine created a postal card for that purpose. In 1918, also inspired by Jarvis, the town of Lyon wanted to celebrate a &quot;journée des Mères&quot;, but instead decided to celebrate a &quot;Journée Nationale des Mères de familles nombreuses.&quot; The holiday was more inspired by anti-depopulation efforts than by the US holiday, with medals awarded to the mothers of large families. The French government made the day official in 1920 as a day for mothers of large families. Since then the French government awards the Médaille de la Famille française to mothers of large families.

In 1941, by an initiative of Philippe Pétain, the wartime Vichy government used the celebration in support of their policy to encourage larger families, but all mothers were now honored, even mothers with smaller families.

In 1950, after the war, the celebration was reinstated. The law of 24 May 1950 required (in Article 1) that the Republic pay official homage to French Mothers. Article 2 stated it should be celebrated on the last Sunday in May as the &quot;Fête des Mères&quot; (except when Pentecost fell on that day, in which case it was moved to the first Sunday in June). Article 3 stated that all expenditure shall be covered from the budget of the Ministry of Public Health and Population.

During the 1950s, the celebration lost all its patriotic and natalist ideologies, and became heavily commercialized.

In 1956, the celebration was given a budget and integrated into the new Code de l&#x27;action Sociale et des familles. In 2004 responsibility for the holiday was transferred to the Minister responsible for families.

====Georgia====
Georgia celebrates Mother&#x27;s Day on 3 March. It was declared by the first President of Georgia Zviad Gamsakhurdia in order to replace the International Women Day, and it was officially approved by the Supreme Council in 1991. Nowadays Georgia celebrates both Mother&#x27;s Day on 3 March and International Women&#x27;s Day on 8 March.

====Germany====
In the 1920s, Germany had the lowest birthrate in Europe, and the declining trend was continuing. This was attributed to women&#x27;s participation in the labor market. At the same time, influential groups in society (politicians of left and right, churchwomen, and feminists) believed that mothers should be honored but could not agree on how to do so. However, all groups strongly agreed on the promotion of the values of motherhood. In 1923, this resulted in the unanimous adoption of &quot;Muttertag&quot;, the Mother&#x27;s Day holiday as imported from America. The head of the Association of German Florists cited &quot;the inner conflict of our &quot;Volk&quot; and the loosening of the family&quot; as his reason for introducing the holiday. He expected that the holiday would unite the divided country. In 1925, the Mother&#x27;s Day Committee joined the task force for the recovery of the &quot;volk&quot;, and the holiday stopped depending on commercial interests and began emphasizing the need to increase the population in Germany by promoting motherhood.

The holiday was then seen as a means to encourage women to bear more children, which nationalists saw as a way to rejuvenate the nation. The holiday did not celebrate individual women, but an idealized standard of motherhood. The progressive forces resisted the implementation of the holiday because it was backed by so many conservatives and because they saw it as a way to eliminate the rights of working women. &quot;Die Frau&quot;, the newspaper of the Federation of German Women&#x27;s Associations, refused to recognize the holiday. Many local authorities adopted their own interpretation of the holiday: it would be a day to support economically larger families or single-mother families. The guidelines for the subsidies had eugenics criteria, but there is no indication that social workers ever implemented them in practice, and subsidies were given preferentially to families in economic need rather than to families with more children or &quot;healthier&quot; children.

With the Nazi party in power during 1933–1945, the situation changed radically. The promotion of Mother&#x27;s Day increased in many European countries, including the UK and France. From the position of the German Nazi government, the role of mothers was to give healthy children to the German nation. The Nazi party&#x27;s intention was to create a pure &quot;Aryan race&quot; according to nazi eugenics. Among other Mother&#x27;s Day ideas, the government promoted the death of a mother&#x27;s sons in battle as the highest embodiment of patriotic motherhood.

The Nazis quickly declared Mother&#x27;s Day an official holiday and put it under the control of the NSV (National Socialist People&#x27;s Welfare) and the NSF (National Socialist Women&#x27;s League). This created conflicts with other organizations that resented Nazi control of the holiday, including Catholic and Protestant churches and local women&#x27;s organizations. Local authorities resisted the guidelines from the Nazi government and continued assigning resources to families who were in economic need, much to the dismay of the Nazi officials.
In 1938, the government began issuing an award called Mother&#x27;s Cross (&quot;Mutterkreuz&quot;), according to categories that depended on the number of children a mother had. The medal was awarded on Mother&#x27;s Day and also on other holidays due to a large number of recipients. The Cross was an effort to encourage women to have more children, and recipients were required to have at least four.

====Hungary====
In Hungary, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on the first Sunday of May. It was first celebrated in 1925 by the Hungarian Red Cross Youth.

====India====
The modern Mother&#x27;s Day has been assimilated into Indian culture and is celebrated every year on the second Sunday of May. Indians do not celebrate the occasion as a religious event; its celebration is mostly restricted to urban areas where the occasion has been largely commercialized.

====Indonesia====
Indonesian Mother&#x27;s Day () is celebrated nationally on 22 December. The date was made an official holiday by President Sukarno under Presidential Decree No. 316/1953, on the 25th anniversary of the 1928 Indonesian Women Congress. The day originally sought to celebrate the spirit of Indonesian women and to improve the condition of the nation. Today, the meaning of Mother&#x27;s Day has changed, and it is celebrated by expressing love and gratitude to mothers. People present gifts to mothers (such as flowers) and hold surprise parties and competitions, which include cooking and kebaya wearing. People also allow mothers a day off from domestic chores.

The holiday is celebrated on the anniversary of the opening day of the first Indonesian Women Congress (&quot;Kongres Perempuan Indonesia&quot;), which was held from 22 to 25 December 1928. The Congress took place in a building called Dalem Jayadipuran, which now serves as the office of the Center of History and Traditional Values Preservation (&quot;Balai Pelestarian Sejarah dan Nilai Tradisional&quot;) in Brigjen Katamso Street, Yogyakarta. The Congress was attended by 30 feminist organizations from 12 cities in Java and Sumatra. In Indonesia, feminist organizations have existed since 1912, inspired by Indonesian heroines of the 19th century, e.g., Kartini, Martha Christina Tiahahu, Cut Nyak Meutia, Maria Walanda Maramis, Dewi Sartika, Nyai Ahmad Dahlan, Rasuna Said, etc. The Congress intended to improve women&#x27;s rights in education and marriage.

Indonesia also celebrates the Kartini Day (&quot;Hari Kartini&quot;) on 21 April, in memory of activist Raden Ajeng Kartini. This is a celebration of the emancipation of women. The observance was instituted at the 1938 Indonesian Women Congress.

During President Suharto&#x27;s New Order (1965–1998), government propaganda used Mother&#x27;s Day and Kartini Day to inculcate into women the idea that they should be docile and stay at home.

====Iran====
In Iran, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on 20 Jumada al-thani. This is the sixth month in the Islamic calendar (a lunar calendar) and every year the holiday falls on a different day of the Gregorian calendar. This is the birthday anniversary of Fatimah, the Islamic prophet Muhammad&#x27;s only daughter according to Shia Islam. On this day, banners reading &quot;&quot;Ya Fatemeah&quot; (O! Fatemeh)&quot; are displayed on &quot;government buildings, private buildings, public streets and car windows.&quot; Mother&#x27;s Day was originally observed on 16 December but the date was changed after the Iranian Revolution in 1979. The celebration is both Women&#x27;s Day (replacing International Women&#x27;s Day) and Mother&#x27;s Day.

In 1960, the Institute for Women Protection adopted the Western holiday and established it on 25 Azar (16 December), the date the Institute was founded. The Institute&#x27;s action had the support of Empress Farah Pahlavi, the wife of the last Shah of Persia, who promoted the construction of maternity clinics in remote parts of the country to commemorate the day. Pahlavi regime used the holiday to promote &quot;gender ideologies&quot; of the regime. The Shah&#x27;s government honored and gave awards to women who represented the idealized view of the regime, including mothers who had many healthy children.

According to Shahla Haeri, the Islamic Republic government has used the holiday to &quot;control and channel women&#x27;s movements&quot; and to promote role models for the traditional concept of family. Fatimah is seen by these critics as the chosen model of a woman completely dedicated to certain traditionally sanctioned feminine roles. However, supporters of the choice contend that there is much more to her life story than simply such &quot;traditional&quot; roles.

====Ireland====
In Ireland, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on the fourth Sunday of Lent, as in the United Kingdom, and has the same roots in Mothering Sunday. The practice died out in Ireland around the late 18th century but was revived around the 1950s due to Americanisation.

====Israel====
The Jewish population of Israel used to celebrate Mother&#x27;s Day on Shevat 30 of the Jewish calendar, which falls between 30 January and 1 March. The celebration was set as the same date that Henrietta Szold died (13 February 1945). Henrietta had no biological children, but her organization Youth Aliyah rescued many Jewish children from Nazi Germany and provided for them. She also championed children&#x27;s rights. Szold is considered the &quot;mother&quot; of all those children, and that is why her annual remembrance day (יום השנה) was set as Mother&#x27;s Day (יוֹם הָאֵם, yom ha&#x27;em). The holiday has evolved over time, becoming a celebration of mutual love inside the family, called Family Day (יוֹם הַמִשְּפָּחָה, yom hamishpacha). This holiday is mainly celebrated in preschools with an activity to which parents are invited. Mother&#x27;s Day is mainly celebrated by children at kindergartens. There are no longer mutual gifts among members of the family, and there is no longer any commercialization of the celebration. It is not an official holiday.

====Italy====
Mother&#x27;s Day in Italy was celebrated for the first time on 24 December 1933 as the &quot;Day of the mother and the child&quot; (&quot;Giornata della madre e del fanciullo&quot;). It was instituted by the Opera nazionale maternità e infanzia in order to publicly reward the most prolific Italian women every year.

After World War II, Mother&#x27;s Day was first celebrated on 12 May 1957 in Assisi, at the initiative of Reverend Otello Migliosi, the parish priest of the Tordibetto church. This celebration was so popular that in the following year Mother&#x27;s Day was adopted throughout Italy. On 18 December 1958, a proposal was presented to the Italian Senate to make the holiday official.

====Japan====
In Japan, was initially commemorated during the Shōwa period as the birthday of Empress Kōjun (mother of Emperor Akihito) on 6 March. This was established in 1931 when the Imperial Women&#x27;s Union was organized. In 1937, the first meeting of &quot;Praise Mothers&quot; was held on 8 May, and in 1949 Japanese society adopted the second Sunday of May as the official date for Mother&#x27;s Day in Japan. Today, people typically give their mothers gifts of flowers such as red carnations and roses. Giving carnations on Mother&#x27;s Day is the most common in Japan.

====Kyrgyzstan====
In Kyrgyzstan, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on 19 May every year. The holiday was first celebrated in 2012. Mothers are also honored on International Women&#x27;s Day

====Latvia====
Mother&#x27;s Day in Latvia was celebrated for the first time in 1922. Since 1934, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on the second Sunday of May. After the end of the Soviet occupation of Baltic states celebration was resumed in 1992. Mothers are also honored on International Women&#x27;s Day.

====Lithuania====
Mother&#x27;s Day in Lithuania was celebrated for the first time in 1928. In Lithuania, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on the first Sunday of May.

====Malawi====
In Malawi, Mother&#x27;s Day is a public holiday. The day is observed on 15 October or the following workday. It is celebrated on the UN&#x27;s World Rural Women&#x27;s Day.

====Maldives====
In the Maldives, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on 13 May. The day is celebrated in different ways. Children give gifts and spend time with their mothers. Daughters give their mothers cards and handmade gifts and sons give their mothers gifts and flowers. Maldivians love to celebrate Mother&#x27;s day, and they have it specially written on their calendar.

====Malta====
The first mention of Mother&#x27;s Day in Malta occurred during the Radio Children&#x27;s Programmes run by Frans H. Said in May 1961. Within a few years, Mother&#x27;s Day became one of the most popular dates in the Maltese calendar. In Malta, this day is commemorated on the second Sunday in May. Mothers are invariably given gifts and invited for lunch, usually at a good quality restaurant.

====Mexico====

In Mexico, the government of Álvaro Obregón imported the Mother&#x27;s Day holiday from the US in 1922, and the newspaper &quot;Excélsior&quot; held a massive promotional campaign for the holiday that year. The conservative government tried to use the holiday to promote a more conservative role for mothers in families, but that perspective was criticized by the socialists as promoting an unrealistic image of a woman who was not good for much more than breeding.

In the mid-1930s, the leftist government of Lázaro Cárdenas promoted the holiday as a &quot;patriotic festival&quot;. The Cárdenas government tried to use the holiday as a vehicle for various efforts: to stress the importance of families as the basis for national development; to benefit from the loyalty that Mexicans felt towards their mothers; to introduce new morals to Mexican women; and to reduce the influence that the church and the Catholic right exerted over women. The government sponsored the holiday in the schools. However, ignoring the strict guidelines from the government, theatre plays were filled with religious icons and themes. Consequently, the &quot;national celebrations&quot; became &quot;religious fiestas&quot; despite the efforts of the government.

Soledad Orozco García, the wife of President Manuel Ávila Camacho, promoted the holiday during the 1940s, resulting in an important state-sponsored celebration. The 1942 celebration lasted a full week and included an announcement that all women could reclaim their pawned sewing machines from the Monte de Piedad at no cost.

Due to Orozco&#x27;s promotion, the Catholic National Synarchist Union (UNS) took heed of the holiday around 1941. Shop-owner members of the Party of the Mexican Revolution (now the Institutional Revolutionary Party) observed a custom allowing women from humble classes to pick a free Mother&#x27;s Day gift from a shop to bring home to their families. The Synarchists worried that this promoted both materialism and the idleness of lower classes, and in turn, reinforced the systemic social problems of the country. Currently this holiday practice is viewed as very conservative, but the 1940s&#x27; UNS saw Mother&#x27;s Day as part of the larger debate on the modernization that was happening at the time. This economic modernization was inspired by US models and was sponsored by the state. The fact that the holiday was originally imported from the US was seen as evidence of an attempt at imposing capitalism and materialism in Mexican society.

The UNS and the clergy of the city of León interpreted the government&#x27;s actions as an effort to secularize the holiday and to promote a more active role for women in society. They concluded that the government&#x27;s long-term goal was to cause women to abandon their traditional roles at home in order to spiritually weaken men. They also saw the holiday as an attempt to secularize the cult to the Virgin Mary, inside a larger effort to dechristianize several holidays. The government sought to counter these claims by organizing widespread masses and asking religious women to assist with the state-sponsored events in order to &quot;depaganize&quot; them. The clergy preferred to promote 2 July celebration of the Santísima Virgen de la Luz, the patron of León, Guanajuato, in replacement of Mother&#x27;s Day. In 1942, at the same time as Soledad&#x27;s greatest celebration of Mother&#x27;s Day, the clergy organized the 210th celebration of the Virgin Mary with a large parade in León.

There is a consensus among scholars that the Mexican government abandoned its revolutionary initiatives during the 1940s, including its efforts to influence Mother&#x27;s Day.

Today the &quot;Día de las Madres&quot; is an unofficial holiday in Mexico held each year on 10 May, the day on which it was first celebrated in Mexico.

In Mexico, to show affection and appreciation to the mother, it is traditional to start the celebration with the famous song &quot;Las Mañanitas&quot;, either a cappella, with the help of a mariachi or a contracted trio. Families usually gather to celebrate, trying to spend as much time as possible with mothers to honor them. They bring some dishes and eat together or visit a restaurant.

====Myanmar====
In Myanmar, Mothers&#x27; Day (the plural form of mother is used as an official title) is celebrated on the full moon day of Pyatho, the tenth month of the Myanmar calendar, which usually falls in January. At the proposal and initiative of U Thukha, who put a lot of effort into founding this day, it was first celebrated in Mandalay on the full moon day of Pyatho in 1995, but it was officially added to the Myanmar calendar in 1997, two years after its first celebration.

People who are away from home, send postcards or phone their mothers to express love and gratitude and those who live with their mother, give her personal service, like bathing or shampooing, and usually take her to pagodas.

====Nepal====
In Nepal, there is a festival equivalent to Mother&#x27;s Day, called Mata Tirtha Aunsi (&quot;Mother Pilgrimage New Moon&quot;), or Mata Tirtha Puja (&quot;Mother Pilgrimage Worship&quot;). It is celebrated according to the lunar calendar. It falls on the last day of the dark fortnight in the month of Baishakh which falls in April–May (in 2015, it will occur on 18 April). The dark fortnight lasts for 15 days from the full moon to the new moon. This festival is observed to commemorate and honor mothers, and it is celebrated by giving gifts to mothers and remembering mothers who are no more.

To honor mothers who have died, it is the tradition to go on a pilgrimage to the Mata Tirtha ponds, located 6 km to the southwest of downtown Kathmandu. The nearby Mata Tirtha village is named after these ponds. Previously, the tradition was observed primarily by the Newar community and other people living in the Kathmandu Valley. Now this festival is widely celebrated across the country.

Many tragic folklore legends have been created, suggesting different reasons why this pond became a pilgrimage site. The most popular version says that, in ancient times, the mother of a shepherd died, and he made offerings to a nearby pond. There he saw the face of his mother in the water, with her hand taking the offerings. Since then, many people have visited the pond, hoping to see their deceased mother&#x27;s face. Pilgrims believe that they will bring peace to their mothers&#x27; souls by visiting the sacred place. There are two ponds. The larger one is for ritual bathing. The smaller one is used to &quot;look upon mother&#x27;s face&quot;, and is fenced by iron bars to prevent people from bathing in it.

Traditionally, in the Kathmandu valley the South-Western corner is reserved for women and women-related rituals, and the North-Eastern is for men and men-related rituals. The worship place for Mata Tirtha Aunsi is located in Mata Tirtha in the South-Western half of the valley, while the worship place for Gokarna Aunsi, the equivalent celebration for deceased fathers is located in Gokarna, Nepal, in the North-Eastern half. This division is reflected in many aspects of the life in Kathmandu valley.

Mother&#x27;s Day is known as Aama ko Mukh Herne Din in Nepali, which literally means &quot;day to see mother&#x27;s face&quot;. In Nepal Bhasa, the festival is known as Mām yā Khwā Swayegu, which can be translated as &quot;to look upon mother&#x27;s face&quot;.

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, Mother&#x27;s Day was introduced as early as 1910 by the Dutch branch of the Salvation Army. The Royal Dutch Society for Horticulture and Botany, a group protecting the interest of Dutch florists, worked to promote the holiday; they hoped to emulate the commercial success achieved by American florists. They were imitating the campaign already underway by florists in Germany and Austria, but they were aware that the traditions had originated in the US.

Florists launched a major promotional effort in 1925. This included the publication of a book of articles written by famous intellectuals, radio broadcasts, newspapers ads, and the collaboration of priests and teachers who wanted to promote the celebration for their own reasons. In 1931 the second Sunday of May was adopted as the official celebration date. In the mid-1930s the slogan &quot;Moederdag – Bloemendag&quot; (Mother&#x27;s Day – Flowers&#x27; Day) was coined, and the phrase was popular for many years. In the 1930s and 1940s &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day cakes&quot; were given as gifts in hospitals and to the Dutch Queen, who is known as the &quot;mother of the country&quot;. Other trade groups tried to cash in on the holiday and to give new meaning to the holiday in order to promote their own wares as gifts.

Roman Catholic priests complained that the holiday interfered with the honoring of the Virgin Mary, the divine mother, which took place during the whole month of May. In 1926 Mother&#x27;s Day was celebrated on 7 July in order to address these complaints. Catholic organizations and priests tried to Christianize the holiday, but those attempts were rendered futile around the 1960s when the church lost influence and the holiday was completely secularized.

In later years, the initial resistance disappeared, and even leftist newspapers stopped their criticism and endorsed Mother&#x27;s Day.

In the 1980s, the American origin of the holiday was still not widely known, so feminist groups who opposed the perpetuation of gender roles sometimes claimed that Mother&#x27;s Day was invented by Nazis and celebrated on the birthday of Klara Hitler, Hitler&#x27;s mother.

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on the second Sunday in May. Mother&#x27;s Day is not a public holiday. The New Zealand tradition is to send or give cards and gifts and at-home youngsters to attempt to serve mothers a variation on breakfast in bed.

====Nicaragua====
In Nicaragua, the &quot;Día de la Madre&quot; has been celebrated on 30 May since the early 1940s. The date was chosen by President Anastasio Somoza García because it was the birthday of Casimira Sacasa, his wife&#x27;s mother.

====North Korea====
Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on 16 November as a public holiday in North Korea. The date takes its significance from the First National Meeting of Mothers held in 1961, for which Kim Il Sung, the leader of the country, published a work called &quot;The Duty of Mothers in the Education of Children&quot;. The date was designated as Mother&#x27;s Day in May 2012 by the Presidium of the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly but only became a public holiday and appeared on the North Korean calendar starting in 2015.

====Norway====
Mother&#x27;s Day was first celebrated on 9 February 1919 and was initially organized by religious institutions. Later it has become a family day, and the mother is often treated to breakfast in bed, flowers and cake.

It has gradually become a major commercial event, with special pastries, flowers and other presents offered by retailers. Day-cares and primary schools often encourage children to make cards and other gifts.

====Pakistan====
In Pakistan, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on the second Sunday of May. Media channels celebrate with special shows. Individuals honor their mothers by giving gifts and commemorative articles. Individuals who have lost their mothers pray and pay their respects to their loved ones lost. Schools hold special programs in order to acknowledge the efforts of their mothers.

====Panama====
In Panama, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on 8 December, the same day as the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. This date was suggested in 1930 by the wife of Panama&#x27;s President Florencio Harmodio Arosemena. 8 December was adopted as Mother&#x27;s Day under Law 69, which was passed the same year.

According to another account, in 1924 the Rotary Club of Panama asked that Mother&#x27;s Day be celebrated on 11 May. Politician Aníbal D. Ríos changed the proposal so that the celebration would be held on 8 December. He then established Mother&#x27;s Day as a national holiday on that date.

====Paraguay====
In Paraguay, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on 15 May, the same day as the &quot;Dia de la Patria&quot;, which celebrates the independence of Paraguay. This date was chosen to honor the role played by Juana María de Lara in the events of 14 May 1811 that led to Paraguay&#x27;s independence.

In 2008, the Paraguayan Minister of Culture, Bruno Barrios, lamented this coincidence because, in Paraguay, Mother&#x27;s Day is much more popular than independence day and the independence celebration goes unnoticed. As a result, Barrios asked that the celebration be moved to the end of the month. A group of young people attempted to gather 20,000 signatures to ask the Parliament to move Mother&#x27;s Day. In 2008, the &quot;Comisión de festejos&quot; (Celebration Committee) of the city of Asunción asked that Mother&#x27;s Day be moved to the second Sunday of May.

====Philippines====
In the Philippines, Mother&#x27;s Day is officially celebrated on the second Sunday of May, but it is not a public holiday. Although not a traditional Filipino holiday, the occasion owes its popularity to American Colonial Period influence.

According to a 2008 article by the Philippine News Agency, in 1921 the Ilocos Norte Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs asked to declare the first Monday of December as Mother&#x27;s Day &quot;to honor these fabulous women who brought forth God&#x27;s children into this world.&quot; In response, Governor-General Charles Yeater issued Circular No. 33 declaring the celebration. In 1937 President Manuel L. Quezon issued Presidential Proclamation No. 213, changing the name of the occasion from &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot; to &quot;Parent&#x27;s Day&quot; to address the complaints that there wasn&#x27;t a &quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot;. In 1980 President Ferdinand Marcos issued Presidential Proclamation No. 2037 proclaiming the date as both Mother&#x27;s Day and Father&#x27;s Day. In 1988 President Corazon Aquino issued Presidential Proclamation No. 266, changing Mother&#x27;s Day to the second Sunday of May, and Father&#x27;s Day to the third Sunday of June, discontinuing the traditional date. In 1998 President Joseph Estrada returned both celebrations to the first Monday of December.

====Portugal====
In Portugal, the &quot;Dia da Mãe&quot; (&quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot;) is an unofficial holiday held each year on the first Sunday of May (sometimes coinciding with Labour Day). In the weeks leading up to this Sunday, school children spend a few hours a day preparing a gift for their mothers, aided by their school teachers. In general, mothers receive gifts from their family members and this day is meant to be celebrated with the whole family.
It used to be celebrated on 8 December, the same date as the Conception of the Virgin celebration.

====Romania====
In Romania, Mother&#x27;s Day has been celebrated on the first Sunday of May since 2010. Law 319/2009 made both Mother&#x27;s Day and Father&#x27;s Day official holidays in Romania. The measure was passed thanks to campaign efforts from the Alliance Fighting Discrimination Against Fathers (TATA). Previously, Mother&#x27;s Day was celebrated on 8 March, as part of International Women&#x27;s Day (a tradition dating back to when Romania was part of the Eastern bloc). Today, Mother&#x27;s Day and International Women&#x27;s Day are two separate holidays, with International Women&#x27;s Day being held on its original date of 8 March.

====Russia====

Traditionally Russia had celebrated International Women&#x27;s Day and Mother&#x27;s Day on 8 March, an inheritance from the Soviet Union, and a public holiday.

Women&#x27;s Day was first celebrated on the last Sunday in February in 1913 in Russia.

In 1917, demonstrations marking International Women&#x27;s Day in Saint Petersburg on the last Sunday in February (which fell on 8 March on the Gregorian calendar) initiated the February Revolution. Following the October Revolution later that year, the Bolshevik Alexandra Kollontai persuaded Vladimir Lenin to make it an official holiday in the Soviet Union, and it was established, but was a working day until 1965.

On 8 May 1965, by the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, International Women&#x27;s Day was declared a non-working day in the Soviet Union &quot;in commemoration of the outstanding merits of Soviet women in communistic construction, in the defense of their Fatherland during the Great Patriotic War, in their heroism and selflessness at the front and in the rear, and also marking the great contribution of women to strengthening friendship between peoples, and the struggle for peace. But still, women&#x27;s day must be celebrated as are other holidays.&quot;

====Samoa====
In Samoa, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on the second Sunday in May, and as a recognised national holiday on the Monday following.

====Singapore====
In Singapore, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on the second Sunday of May. It is not recognized as a holiday by the government.

====Slovakia====
Czechoslovakia celebrated only Women&#x27;s Day until the Velvet Revolution in 1989. After the country split in 1993, Slovakia started celebrating both Women&#x27;s Day and Mother&#x27;s Day. The politicization of Women&#x27;s Day has affected the official status of Mother&#x27;s Day. Center-right parties want Mother&#x27;s Day to replace Women&#x27;s Day, and social-democrats want to make Women&#x27;s Day an official holiday. Currently, both days are festive, but they are not &quot;state holidays&quot;. In the Slovak Republic, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated every second Sunday in May.

====South Africa====
In South Africa, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on the second Sunday of May. It is not recognized as a holiday by the government. The tradition is to give cards and gifts and to serve mothers breakfast in bed or to go out to lunch together as a family.

====South Sudan====
In South Sudan, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on the first Monday in July. The president Salva Kiir Mayardit proclaimed Mother&#x27;s Day as the first Monday in July after handing over from Sudan. Children in South Sudan are presenting mothers with gifts and flowers. The first Mother&#x27;s Day was held in that country on 2 July 2012.

====Spain====
In Spain, Mother&#x27;s Day or Día de la Madre is celebrated on the first Sunday of May. The weeks leading up to this Sunday, school children spend a few hours a day preparing a gift for their mothers, aided by their school teachers. In general, mothers receive gifts from their family members &amp; this day is meant to be celebrated with the whole family. It is also said to be celebrated in May, as May is the month dedicated to the Virgin Mary (mother of Jesus) according to Catholicism. The idea of a month dedicated specifically to Mary can be traced back to baroque times. Although it wasn&#x27;t always held during May, Mary Month included thirty daily spiritual exercises honoring Mary.

In 1925 the Valencian poet Julio Menéndez García published a &quot;Hymn to Mother&quot; in a pamphlet in which he proposed the celebration of Mother&#x27;s Day in all Spanish-speaking countries. The official declaration was never produced, but at that time the initiative was adopted at a local level on different dates; thus, for example, in Madrid, Mother&#x27;s Day was celebrated on 4 October 1926.

In 1939 the Youth Front of FET y de las JONS party, promoted the celebration of Mother&#x27;s Day coinciding with the feast of the Immaculate Conception, on 8 December.

In the early 1960s, on the initiative of a chain of department stores (Galerías Preciados), which copied the custom established in Cuba, Mother&#x27;s Day was also celebrated on the first Sunday of May (El Corte Inglés, the great competitor of Galerías Preciados, celebrated the holiday in December). The two dates, May and December, coexisted until 1965 when the ecclesiastical authorities chose to celebrate the festival in May, within the month consecrated to the Virgin, to recover the authentic character of the Day of the Immaculate Conception.

====Sri Lanka====
In Sri Lanka, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on the second Sunday of May.

====Sweden====
In Sweden, Mother&#x27;s Day was first celebrated in 1919, by an initiative of the author Cecilia Bååth-Holmberg. It took several decades for the day to be widely recognized. Swedes born in the early nineteen hundreds typically did not celebrate the day because of the common belief that the holiday was invented strictly for commercial purposes. This was in contrast to Father&#x27;s Day, which has been widely celebrated in Sweden since the late 1970s. Mother&#x27;s Day in Sweden is celebrated on the last Sunday in May. A later date was chosen to allow everyone to go outside and pick flowers.

====Switzerland====
In Switzerland, the &quot;règle de Pentecôte&quot; law allows Mother&#x27;s Day to be celebrated a week late if the holiday falls on the same day as Pentecost. In 2008, merchants declined to move the date.

====Taiwan====
In Taiwan, Mother&#x27;s Day is celebrated on the second Sunday of the month of May, coinciding with Buddha&#x27;s birthday and the traditional ceremony of &quot;washing the Buddha&quot;. In 1999 the Taiwanese government established the second Sunday of May as Buddha&#x27;s birthday, so they would be celebrated in the same day.

Since 2006, the Tzu Chi, the largest charity organization in Taiwan, celebrates the Tzu Chi Day, Mother&#x27;s Day and Buddha&#x27;s birthday all together, as part of a unified celebration and religious observance.

====Thailand====
Mother&#x27;s day in Thailand is celebrated on the birthday of the Queen Mother of Thailand, Sirikit (12 August). The holiday was first celebrated around the 1980s as part of the campaign by the Prime Minister of Thailand Prem Tinsulanonda to promote Thailand&#x27;s Royal family. Father&#x27;s Day is celebrated on the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej&#x27;s birthday.

====Ukraine====
Ukraine celebrates Mother&#x27;s Day () on the second Sunday of May. In Ukraine, Mother&#x27;s Day officially became a holiday in 1999 and has been celebrated since 2000. Ukrainian society also celebrates International Women&#x27;s Day, a holiday adopted under the Soviet Union that remained a tradition in Ukraine after its collapse.

====United Kingdom====
The United Kingdom celebrates Mother&#x27;s Day on the Fourth Sunday in Lent (). In the United Kingdom, the holiday has its roots in the religious Mothering Sunday celebration and was originally unrelated to the international Mother&#x27;s Day holiday. Most historians believe that Mothering Sunday evolved from a medieval practice of visiting one&#x27;s mother church annually on Laetare Sunday.

====United States====


The United States celebrates Mother&#x27;s Day on the second Sunday in May. In 1872 Julia Ward Howe called for women to join in support of disarmament and asked for 2 June 1872, to be established as a &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day for Peace&quot;. Her 1870 &quot;Appeal to womanhood throughout the world&quot; is sometimes referred to as Mother&#x27;s Day Proclamation. But Howe&#x27;s day was not for honouring mothers but for organizing pacifist mothers against war. In the 1880s and 1890s there were several further attempts to establish an American &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot;, but these did not succeed beyond the local level.

In the United States, Mother&#x27;s Day remains one of the biggest days for sales of flowers, greeting cards, and the like; Mother&#x27;s Day is also the biggest holiday for long-distance telephone calls. Moreover, churchgoing is also popular on Mother&#x27;s Day, yielding the highest church attendance after Christmas Eve and Easter. Many worshippers celebrate the day with carnations, coloured if the mother is living and white if she is dead.

Mother&#x27;s Day continues to be one of the most commercially successful U.S. occasions.

It is possible that the holiday would have withered over time without the support and continuous promotion of the florist industries and other commercial industries. Other Protestant holidays from the same time, such as Children&#x27;s Day and Temperance Sunday, do not have the same level of popularity.

<doc id="46279" wikidata="Q8798" url="?curid=46279" title="Ukrainian language">
<text>Ukrainian (, ) is one of the East Slavic languages in the Indo-European languages family, and it is spoken primarily in Ukraine. It is the first (native) language of a large majority of Ukrainians.

Written Ukrainian uses the Ukrainian alphabet, a variant of the Cyrillic script. The standard language is studied by the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and Potebnia Institute of Linguistics. Comparisons are often made between Ukrainian and Russian, another East Slavic language, yet there is more mutual intelligibility with Belarusian, and a closer lexical distance to West Slavic Polish and South Slavic Bulgarian.

Ukrainian is a descendant of Old East Slavic, a language spoken in the medieval state of Kievan Rus&#x27;. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the language developed into Ruthenian, where it became an official language, before a process of Polonization began in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. By the 18th century, Ruthenian diverged into regional variants, and the modern Ukrainian language developed in the territory of present-day Ukraine. Russification saw the Ukrainian language banned as a subject from schools and as a language of instruction in the Russian Empire, and continued in various ways in the Soviet Union. Even so, the language continued to see use throughout the country, and remained particularly strong in Western Ukraine.

==Linguistic development==

===Theories===
Specific developments that led to a gradual change of the Old East Slavic vowel system into the system found in modern Ukrainian began approximately in the 12th/13th century (that is, still at the time of the Kievan Rus&#x27;) with a lengthening and raising of the Old East Slavic mid vowels &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; when followed by a consonant and a weak yer vowel that would eventually disappear completely, for example Old East Slavic котъ /kɔtə/ &gt; Ukrainian кіт /kit/ &#x27;cat&#x27; (via transitional stages such as /koˑtə̆/, /kuˑt(ə̆)/, /kyˑt/ or similar) or Old East Slavic печь /pʲɛtʃʲə/ &gt; Ukrainian піч /pitʃ/ &#x27;oven&#x27; (via transitional stages such as /pʲeˑtʃʲə̆/, /pʲiˑtʃʲ/ or similar). This raising and other phonological developments of the time, such as the merger of the Old East Slavic vowel phonemes и /i/ and ы /ɨ/ into the specifically Ukrainian phoneme /ɪ ~ e/, spelled with и (in the 13th/14th centuries), and the fricativisation of the Old East Slavic consonant г /g/, probably first to /ɣ/ (in the 13th century), with /ɦ/ as a reflex in Modern Ukrainian, did not happen in Russian. Only the fricativisation of Old East Slavic г /g/ occurred in Belarusian, where the present-day reflex is /ɣ/.

Ahatanhel Krymsky and Aleksey Shakhmatov assumed the existence of the common spoken language of Eastern Slavs only in prehistoric times. According to their point of view, the diversification of the Old East Slavic language took place in the 8th or early 9th century.

Russian linguist Andrey Zaliznyak stated that the Old Novgorod dialect differed significantly from that of other dialects of Kievan Rus&#x27; during the 11th–12th century, but started becoming more similar to them around the 13th–15th centuries. The modern Russian language hence developed from the fusion of this Novgorod dialect and the common dialect spoken by the other Kievan Rus&#x27;, whereas the modern Ukrainian and Belarusian languages developed from dialects which did not differ from each other in a significant way.

Ukrainian linguist Stepan Smal-Stotsky denies the existence of a common Old East Slavic language at any time in the past. Similar points of view were shared by Yevhen Tymchenko, Vsevolod Hantsov, Olena Kurylo, Ivan Ohienko and others. According to this theory, the dialects of East Slavic tribes evolved gradually from the common Proto-Slavic language without any intermediate stages during the 6th through 9th centuries. The Ukrainian language was formed by convergence of tribal dialects, mostly due to an intensive migration of the population within the territory of today&#x27;s Ukraine in later historical periods. This point of view was also supported by George Shevelov&#x27;s phonological studies, which argue that specific features were already recognizable in the southern dialects of Old East Slavic (seen as ancestors to Ukrainian) as far back as these varieties can be documented.

===Origins and developments during medieval times===

As a result of close Slavic contacts with the remnants of the Scythian and Sarmatian population north of the Black Sea, lasting into the early Middle Ages, the appearance of the voiced fricative γ/г (romanized &quot;h&quot;), in modern Ukrainian and some southern Russian dialects is explained by the assumption that it initially emerged in Scythian and related eastern Iranian dialects, from earlier common Proto-Indo-European &quot;*g&quot; and &quot;*gʰ&quot;.

During the 13th century, when German settlers were invited to Ukraine by the princes of the Kingdom of Ruthenia, German words began to appear in the language spoken in Ukraine. Their influence would continue under Poland not only through German colonists but also through the Yiddish-speaking Jews. Often such words involve trade or handicrafts. Examples of words of German or Yiddish origin spoken in Ukraine include (&quot;roof&quot;), (&quot;pipe&quot;), (&quot;market&quot;), (&quot;furrier&quot;), and (&quot;master&quot; or &quot;craftsman&quot;).

===Developments under Poland and Lithuania===
In the 13th century, eastern parts of Rus (including Moscow) came under Tatar rule until their unification under the Tsardom of Muscovy, whereas the south-western areas (including Kyiv) were incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. For the following four centuries, the languages of the two regions evolved in relative isolation from each other. Direct written evidence of the existence of the Ukrainian language dates to the late 16th century. By the 16th century, a peculiar official language formed: a mixture of the liturgical standardised language of Old Church Slavonic, Ruthenian and Polish. The influence of the latter gradually increased relative to the former two, as the nobility and rural large-landowning class, known as the szlachta, was largely Polish-speaking. Documents soon took on many Polish characteristics superimposed on Ruthenian phonetics.

Polish–Lithuanian rule and education also involved significant exposure to the Latin language. Much of the influence of Poland on the development of the Ukrainian language has been attributed to this period and is reflected in multiple words and constructions used in everyday Ukrainian speech that were taken from Polish or Latin. Examples of Polish words adopted from this period include &quot;zavzhdy&quot; (always; taken from old Polish word &quot;zawżdy&quot;) and &quot;obitsiaty&quot; (to promise; taken from Polish &quot;obiecać&quot;) and from Latin (via Polish) &quot;raptom&quot; (suddenly) and &quot;meta&quot; (aim or goal).

Significant contact with Tatars and Turks resulted in many Turkic words, particularly those involving military matters and steppe industry, being adopted into the Ukrainian language. Examples include &quot;torba&quot; (bag) and &quot;tyutyun&quot; (tobacco).

Because of the substantial number of loanwords from Polish, German, Czech and Latin, early modern vernacular Ukrainian (&quot;prosta mova&quot;, &quot;simple speech&quot;) had more lexical similarity with West Slavic languages than with Russian or Church Slavonic. By the mid-17th century, the linguistic divergence between the Ukrainian and Russian languages had become so significant that there was a need for translators during negotiations for the Treaty of Pereyaslav, between Bohdan Khmelnytsky, head of the Zaporozhian Host, and the Russian state.

By the 18th century, Ruthenian had diverged into regional variants, developing into the modern Belarusian, Rusyn, and Ukrainian languages.

===Chronology===
The accepted chronology of Ukrainian divides the language into Old Ukrainian, Middle Ukrainian, and Modern Ukrainian. Shevelov explains that much of this is based on the character of contemporary written sources, ultimately reflecting socio-historical developments, and he further subdivides the Middle period into three phases:

* Proto-Ukrainian (abbreviated PU, Ukrainian: , until the mid-11th century), with no extant written sources by speakers in Ukraine. Corresponding to aspects of Old East Slavic.
* Old Ukrainian (OU, or , mid-11th to 14th c., conventional end date 1387), elements of phonology are deduced from written texts mainly in Church Slavic. Part of broader Old East Slavic.
* Middle Ukrainian ( or , 15th to 18th c.), historically called Ruthenian.
** Early Middle Ukrainian (EMU, , 15th to mid-16th c., 1387–1575), analysis focuses on distinguishing Ukrainian and Belarusian texts.
** Middle Ukrainian (MU, , mid-16th to early 18th c., 1575–1720), represented by several vernacular language varieties as well as a version of Church Slavonic.
** Late Middle Ukrainian (LMU, , rest of the 18th c., 1720–1818), found in many mixed Ukrainian–Russian and Russian–Ukrainian texts.
* Modern Ukrainian (MoU, from the very end of the 18th c., or , from 1818), the vernacular recognized first in literature, and subsequently all other written genres.

Ukraine annually marks the Day of Ukrainian Writing and Language on 9 November, the Eastern Orthodox feast day of Nestor the Chronicler.

==History of the spoken language==

===Rus&#x27; and Kingdom of Ruthenia===

The era of Kievan Rus&#x27; ( 880–1240) is the subject of some linguistic controversy, as the language of much of the literature was purely or heavily Old Church Slavonic. Some theorists see an early Ukrainian stage in language development here, calling it Old Ruthenian; others term this era Old East Slavic. Russian theorists tend to amalgamate Rus&#x27; to the modern nation of Russia, and call this linguistic era Old Russian. However, according to Russian linguist Andrey Zaliznyak (2012), people from the Novgorod Republic did not call themselves &quot;Rus″&quot; until the 14th century; earlier Novgorodians reserved the term &quot;Rus″&quot; for the Kiev, Pereyaslavl and Chernigov principalities. At the same time as evidenced by contemporary chronicles, the ruling princes and kings of Galicia–Volhynia and Kiev called themselves &quot;people of Rus″&quot; (in foreign sources called &quot;Ruthenians&quot;), and Galicia–Volhynia has alternately been called the Principality or Kingdom of Ruthenia.

Also according to Andrey Zaliznyak, the Novgorodian dialect differed significantly from that of other dialects of Kievan Rus during the 11th–12th century, but 
started becoming more similar to them around 13th–15th centuries. The modern Russian language hence developed from the fusion of this Novgorodian dialect and the common dialect spoken by the other Kievan Rus, whereas the modern Ukrainian and Belarusian languages developed from the dialects which did not differ from each other in a significant way.

===Under Lithuania/Poland and Muscovy/Russia ===
After the fall of the Kingdom of Ruthenia, Ukrainians mainly fell under the rule of Lithuania and then Poland. Local autonomy of both rule and language was a marked feature of Lithuanian rule. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Old East Slavic became the language of the chancellery and gradually evolved into the Ruthenian language. Polish rule, which came later, was accompanied by a more assimilationist policy. By the 1569 Union of Lublin that formed the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, a significant part of Ukrainian territory was moved from Lithuanian rule to Polish administration, resulting in cultural Polonization and visible attempts to colonize Ukraine by the Polish nobility.

Many Ukrainian nobles learned the Polish language and converted to Catholicism during that period in order to maintain their lofty aristocratic position. Lower classes were less affected because literacy was common only in the upper class and clergy. The latter were also under significant Polish pressure after the Union with the Catholic Church. Most of the educational system was gradually Polonized. In Ruthenia, the language of administrative documents gradually shifted towards Polish.

Polish has had heavy influences on Ukrainian (particularly in Western Ukraine). The southwestern Ukrainian dialects are transitional to Polish. As the Ukrainian language developed further, some borrowings from Tatar and Turkish occurred. Ukrainian culture and language flourished in the sixteenth and first half of the 17th century, when Ukraine was part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, albeit in spite of being part of the PLC, not as a result. Among many schools established in that time, the Kyiv-Mohyla Collegium (the predecessor of the modern Kyiv-Mohyla Academy), founded by the Orthodox Metropolitan Peter Mogila, was the most important. At that time languages were associated more with religions: Catholics spoke Polish, and members of the Orthodox church spoke Ruthenian.

The 1654 Pereiaslav Agreement between Cossack Hetmanate and Alexis of Russia divided Ukraine between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Tsardom of Russia. During the following century, both monarchies became increasingly intolerant of Ukrainian own cultural and political aspirations. Ukrainians found themselves in a colonial situation. The Russian centre adopted the name &quot;Little Russia&quot; for Ukraine and &quot;Little Russian&quot; for the language, an expression that originated in Byzantine Greek and may originally have meant &quot;old, original, fundamental Russia&quot;, and had been in use since the 14th century. Ukrainian high culture went into a long period of steady decline. The Kyiv-Mohyla Academy was taken over by the Russian Empire. Most of the remaining Ukrainian schools also switched to Polish or Russian in the territories controlled by these respective countries, which was followed by a new wave of Polonization and Russification of the native nobility. Gradually the official language of Ukrainian provinces under Poland was changed to Polish, while the upper classes in the Russian part of Ukraine used Russian.

=== In Austrian Galicia and Lodomeria (1772–1918) ===
After the 1772 First Partition of Poland, when the lands annexed by the Austrian Habsburg monarchy were reorganised as the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, the Habsburg administration was initially surprised to find out that, apart from Poles, there were a lot of other people living in it whom they began calling &quot;Ruthenen&quot; (&quot;Ruthenians&quot; or &quot;Rusyny&quot;). They differed from the Poles in that the vast majority of them adhered to the Greek Catholic faith (organised as the Ruthenian Uniate Church) rather than Roman Catholic, and that their liturgical language was Church Slavonic rather than Latin. Most of them had not received much education; they used Ruthenian only as a spoken language, few could read or write, and those who did more often used Polish or (increasingly) German instead. As Empress Maria Theresa had introduced a general compulsory education (&quot;Allgemeiner Schulzwang&quot;) in 1774, and enacted it in newly-acquired Galicia and Lodomeria in 1777, the decision was made to produce Polish and Ruthenian textbooks that were used in elementary schools for those language communities. 

Although some Ruthenian parish schools were established in some villages, and some printed primers and catechisms in Ruthenian were distributed there, the effects of Ruthenian-language education achieved very little until 1815. That year, , a Przemyśl eparchy canon who contributed to the establishment of a strong network of Ruthenian parish schools and a teacher training school, published a catechism at the Royal University of Buda entitled &quot;Christian Learning in the Case of the Common Catechism for Parish Children&quot;. He followed this up in 1823 by a &quot;Grammar of the Slovene–Ruthenian language&quot; (never published), and in 1829 by his treatise &quot;Information on the Ruthenian Language&quot; (published both in Polish as &quot;Rozprawa o ięzyku ruskim&quot; and in Russian as &quot;Відомість о руском языці&quot;), which represents the first scholarly study arguing that Ruthenian was a language in its own right, separate from Polish, Russian, and Church Slavonic. On the other hand, new educational regulations in 1818 determined that schools that were exclusively attended by children of Greek Catholic parents were to receive instruction in Ruthenian, whereas schools attended by children of both Roman Catholic and Greek Catholic parents had Polish as the medium of instruction. Nevertheless, pupils at Ruthenian-instruction schools had to learn Polish as a second language as well. In higher education, Ruthenian was not valued as an equal language, and students were expected to learn and use Latin and Polish instead. Students training to become Greek Catholic priests at the University of Lviv did receive instruction in Ruthenian in the so-called &quot;Studium ruthenum&quot; according to Austrian regulations between 1787 and 1809, but it was not a fully-fledged course; instead, it was regarded as a temporary measure for students who did not yet know Latin. Both its professors and alumni received only half the salary of their counterparts from the &quot;Studium latinum&quot;, the number of students steadily decreased over the decades, and in 1809 the Ruthenians themselves requested the &quot;Studium ruthenum&quot; to be abandoned.

In the first few decades of the Austrian period in Galicia, there was also confusion amongst both the Habsburg administration and educated Ruthenians about which variety of written Ruthenian to use: late Church Slavonic, literary Russian, traditional written Ruthenian, or something close to how Ruthenian was actually spoken in Galicia at that time. The Habsburg Imperial censor for Slavic publications, Jernej Kopitar (himself from Slovenia), encouraged Ruthenian authors to base their written language on the Ruthenian vernacular, and from December 1833 onwards, to write Ruthenian in a Latin alphabet rather than Cyrillic. This initiated a discussion on Ruthenian identity, later called the &quot;First Alphabet War&quot; or &quot;Blizzard&quot;. Although most Ruthenian intellectuals did respond by increasingly basing their writings on spoken Ruthenian, the majority of them defended the use Cyrillic over concerns of Polonisation. Nevertheless, they could not agree on various standardisation issues; three different Ruthenian grammars were published between 1834 and 1848, and none of them was widely adopted. Before 1848, no Ruthenian dictionaries were produced, no Ruthenian-language periodical press existed within Habsburg Galicia, and Ruthenian played no role as language of administration.
The Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire changed everything: the native languages of most populations in the Empire, including Ruthenian, were accorded official status, and all laws in the Danubian monarchy would be published in these languages from 1 October 1849 onwards. Ruthenian would henceforth to be used in local administration in the &quot;Landesgesetzblätter&quot;. From 1849 onwards, various official periodicals were established in Ruthenian, and the Interior Ministry stipulated in July 1849 that street signs in Lviv had to include Ruthenian versions. In October 1852, the Ministry of Justice also decreed that Ruthenian could be used by parties involved in legal issues in their communication with the courts of law, although it would take until 1861 to allow these letters to employ &quot;skoropys&quot; Cyrillic rather than Latin script (or the Muscovite &quot;graždanka&quot; variety of Cyrillic). In the post-1848, there were some contradictory developments, some of which countered Polonisation in the sphere of education, while others stimulated further Polonisation in the sphere of administration. Similarly, Galician Russophilia or Moscophilia strived towards ever greater assimilation of Ruthenian towards the so-called &quot;Great Russian&quot; language as used in Moscow that still heavily leaned on Church Slavonic, while both the Habsburg administration and Greek Catholic Church raised concerns that these were &quot;barely comprehensible&quot; to the common people of Galicia and hampered the &quot;development of the Ruthenian language&quot;, adding that Orthodox Imperial Russia was a threat to the overwhelmingly Catholic Habsburg realm. 

Matters once again came to a head in May 1859, when the Polish governor of Galicia Gołuchowski recommended Czech linguist Josef Jireček&#x27;s proposal for a Ruthenian Latin alphabet, leading to the &quot;Second Alphabet War&quot; or &quot;Blizzard&quot;. Ruthenian intellectuals almost unanimously rejected the proposal for fear of Polonisation, leading the government to overreact by banning the &quot;Russian script&quot; (meaning the Muscovite &quot;graždanka&quot;) in July 1859, which Ruthenian writers generally ignored. By March 1861, the Habsburg State Ministry essentially conceded defeat by stating that the Ruthenians themselves were responsible for developing their own language, and that it was not up to the government. Around the same time, however, Ruthenian intellectuals became acquainted with the writings of Ukrainian intellectuals from &quot;Little Russia&quot; in the Russian Empire, such as poet Taras Shevchenko (died 1861), who was fiercely anti-Russian and Ukrainophile, leading many earlier Galician Ruthenians to abandon their Russophilia. In between the pro-Polish and pro-Russian tendencies, the Ruthenian language in Galicia would gradually develop into an independent literary and intellectual written language in the second half of the 19th century, when it was increasingly called &quot;Ukrainian&quot;.

=== In the Russian Empire ===
During the 19th century, a revival of Ukrainian self-identification manifested in the literary classes of both Russian-Empire Dnieper Ukraine and Austrian Galicia. The Brotherhood of Sts Cyril and Methodius in Kyiv applied an old word for the Cossack motherland, &quot;Ukrajina&quot;, as a self-appellation for the nation of Ukrainians, and &quot;Ukrajins&#x27;ka mova&quot; for the language. Many writers published works in the Romantic tradition of Europe demonstrating that Ukrainian was not merely a language of the village but suitable for literary pursuits.

However, in the Russian Empire expressions of Ukrainian culture and especially language were repeatedly persecuted for fear that a self-aware Ukrainian nation would threaten the unity of the empire. In 1804 Ukrainian as a subject and language of instruction was banned from schools. In 1811, by order of the Russian government, the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy was closed.

In 1847 the Brotherhood of St Cyril and Methodius was terminated. The same year Taras Shevchenko was arrested, exiled for ten years, and banned for political reasons from writing and painting. In 1862 Pavlo Chubynsky was exiled for seven years to Arkhangelsk. The Ukrainian magazine &quot;Osnova&quot; was discontinued. In 1863, the tsarist interior minister Pyotr Valuyev proclaimed in his decree that &quot;there never has been, is not, and never can be a separate Little Russian language&quot;.

Although the name of Ukraine is known since 1187, it was not applied to the language until the mid-19th century. The linguonym &quot;Ukrainian language&quot; appears in Yakub Holovatsky&#x27;s book from 1849, listed there as a variant name of the &quot;Little Russian language&quot;. In a private letter from 1854, Taras Shevchenko lauds &quot;our splendid Ukrainian language&quot;. Valuyev&#x27;s decree from 1863 derides the &quot;Little Russian&quot; language throughout, but also mentions &quot;the so-called Ukrainian language&quot; once. In Galicia, the earliest applications of the term &quot;Ukrainian&quot; to the language were in the hyphenated names &quot;Ukrainian-Ruthenian&quot; (1866, by Paulin Święcicki) or &quot;Ruthenian-Ukrainian&quot; (1871, by Panteleimon Kulish and Ivan Puluj), with non-hyphenated &quot;Ukrainian language&quot; appearing shortly thereafter (in 1878, by Mykhailo Drahomanov).

A following ban on Ukrainian books led to Alexander II&#x27;s secret Ems Ukaz, which prohibited publication and importation of most Ukrainian-language books, public performances and lectures, and even banned the printing of Ukrainian texts accompanying musical scores. A period of leniency after 1905 was followed by another strict ban in 1914, which also affected Russian-occupied Galicia.

For much of the 19th century the Austrian authorities demonstrated some preference for Polish culture, but the Ukrainians were relatively free to partake in their own cultural pursuits in Halychyna and Bukovina, where Ukrainian was widely used in education and official documents. The suppression by Russia hampered the literary development of the Ukrainian language in Dnipro Ukraine, but there was a constant exchange with Halychyna, and many works were published under Austria and smuggled to the east.

By the time of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the collapse of Austro-Hungary in 1918, Ukrainians were ready to openly develop a body of national literature, institute a Ukrainian-language educational system, and form an independent state (the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, shortly joined by the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic). During this brief independent statehood the stature and use of Ukrainian greatly improved.

====Speakers in the Russian Empire====

In the Russian Empire Census of 1897 the following picture emerged, with Ukrainian being the second most spoken language of the Russian Empire. According to the Imperial census&#x27;s terminology, the Russian language (&quot;Русскій&quot;) was subdivided into Ukrainian (Малорусскій, &#x27;Little Russian&#x27;), what is known as Russian today (Великорусскій, &#x27;Great Russian&#x27;), and Belarusian (Бѣлорусскій, &#x27;White Russian&#x27;).

The following table shows the distribution of settlement by native language (&quot;по родному языку&quot;) in 1897 in Russian Empire governorates (&quot;guberniyas&quot;) that had more than 100,000 Ukrainian speakers.

Although in the rural regions of the Ukrainian provinces, 80% of the inhabitants said that Ukrainian was their native language in the Census of 1897 (for which the results are given above), in the urban regions only 32.5% of the population claimed Ukrainian as their native language. For example, in Odesa (then part of the Russian Empire), at the time the largest city in the territory of current Ukraine, only 5.6% of the population said Ukrainian was their native language.

Until the 1920s the urban population in Ukraine grew faster than the number of Ukrainian speakers. This implies that there was a (relative) decline in the use of Ukrainian language. For example, in Kyiv, the number of people stating that Ukrainian was their native language declined from 30.3% in 1874 to 16.6% in 1917.

===Soviet era===
During the seven-decade-long Soviet era, the Ukrainian language held the formal position of the principal local language in the Ukrainian SSR. However, practice was often a different story: Ukrainian always had to compete with Russian, and the attitudes of the Soviet leadership towards Ukrainian varied from encouragement and tolerance to de facto banishment.

Officially, there was no state language in the Soviet Union until the very end when it was proclaimed in 1990 that Russian language was the all-Union state language and that the constituent republics had rights to declare additional state languages within their jurisdictions. Still it was implicitly understood in the hopes of minority nations that Ukrainian would be used in the Ukrainian SSR, Uzbek would be used in the Uzbek SSR, and so on. However, Russian was used as the lingua franca in all parts of the Soviet Union and a special term, &quot;a language of inter-ethnic communication&quot;, was coined to denote its status.

====Stalin====


====Khrushchev thaw====
After the death of Stalin (1953), a general policy of relaxing the language policies of the past was implemented (1958 to 1963). The Khrushchev era which followed saw a policy of relatively lenient concessions to development of the languages at the local and republic level, though its results in Ukraine did not go nearly as far as those of the Soviet policy of Ukrainianization in the 1920s. Journals and encyclopedic publications advanced in the Ukrainian language during the Khrushchev era, as well as transfer of Crimea under Ukrainian SSR jurisdiction.

Yet, the 1958 school reform that allowed parents to choose the language of primary instruction for their children, unpopular among the circles of the national intelligentsia in parts of the USSR, meant that non-Russian languages would slowly give way to Russian in light of the pressures of survival and advancement. The gains of the past, already largely reversed by the Stalin era, were offset by the liberal attitude towards the requirement to study the local languages (the requirement to study Russian remained).

Parents were usually free to choose the language of study of their children (except in few areas where attending the Ukrainian school might have required a long daily commute) and they often chose Russian, which reinforced the resulting Russification. In this sense, some analysts argue that it was not the &quot;oppression&quot; or &quot;persecution&quot;, but rather the &quot;lack of protection&quot; against the expansion of Russian language that contributed to the relative decline of Ukrainian in the 1970s and 1980s. According to this view, it was inevitable that successful careers required a good command of Russian, while knowledge of Ukrainian was not vital, so it was common for Ukrainian parents to send their children to Russian-language schools, even though Ukrainian-language schools were usually available.

The number of students in Russian-language in Ukraine schools was constantly increasing, from 14 percent in 1939 to more than 30 percent in 1962.

====Shelest period====
The Communist Party leader from 1963 to 1972, Petro Shelest, pursued a policy of defending Ukraine&#x27;s interests within the Soviet Union. He proudly promoted the beauty of the Ukrainian language and developed plans to expand the role of Ukrainian in higher education. He was removed, however, after only a brief tenure, for being too lenient on Ukrainian nationalism.

====Shcherbytsky period====
The new party boss from 1972 to 1989, Volodymyr Shcherbytsky, purged the local party, was fierce in suppressing dissent, and insisted Russian be spoken at all official functions, even at local levels. His policy of Russification was lessened only slightly after 1985.

====Gorbachev and perebudova====

The management of dissent by the local Ukrainian Communist Party was more fierce and thorough than in other parts of the Soviet Union. As a result, at the start of the Mikhail Gorbachev reforms perebudova and hlasnist’ (Ukrainian for &quot;perestroika&quot; and &quot;glasnost&quot;), Ukraine under Shcherbytsky was slower to liberalize than Russia itself.

Although Ukrainian still remained the native language for the majority in the nation on the eve of Ukrainian independence, a significant share of ethnic Ukrainians were russified. In Donetsk there were no Ukrainian language schools and in Kyiv only a quarter of children went to Ukrainian language schools.

The Russian language was the dominant vehicle, not just of government function, but of the media, commerce, and modernity itself. This was substantially less the case for western Ukraine, which escaped the artificial famine, Great Purge, and most of Stalinism. And this region became the center of a hearty, if only partial, renaissance of the Ukrainian language during independence.

===Independence in the modern era===

Since 1991, Ukrainian has been the official state language in Ukraine, and the state administration implemented government policies to broaden the use of Ukrainian. The educational system in Ukraine has been transformed over the first decade of independence from a system that is partly Ukrainian to one that is overwhelmingly so. The government has also mandated a progressively increased role for Ukrainian in the media and commerce.

In the 2001 census, 67.5% of the country&#x27;s population named Ukrainian as their native language (a 2.8% increase from 1989), while 29.6% named Russian (a 3.2% decrease). For many Ukrainians (of various ethnic origins), the term &quot;native language&quot; may not necessarily associate with the language they use more frequently. The overwhelming majority of ethnic Ukrainians consider the Ukrainian language &quot;native&quot;, including those who often speak Russian.

According to the official 2001 census data, 92.3% of Kyiv region population responded &quot;Ukrainian&quot; to the &quot;native language&quot; (&quot;ridna mova&quot;) census question, compared with 88.4% in 1989, and 7.2% responded &quot;Russian&quot;. 

In 2019, the law of Ukraine &quot;On protecting the functioning of the Ukrainian language as the state language&quot; was approved by the parliament, formalizing rules governing the usage of the language and introducing penalties for violations.

==Literature and literary language==
The literary Ukrainian language, which was preceded by Old East Slavic literature, may be subdivided into two stages: during the 12th to 18th centuries what in Ukraine is referred to as &quot;Old Ukrainian&quot;, but elsewhere, and in contemporary sources, is known as the Ruthenian language, and from the end of the 18th century to the present what in Ukraine is known as &quot;Modern Ukrainian&quot;, but elsewhere is known as just Ukrainian.

Influential literary figures in the development of modern Ukrainian literature include the philosopher Hryhorii Skovoroda, Ivan Kotlyarevsky, Mykola Kostomarov, Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky, Shevchenko, Ivan Franko, and Lesia Ukrainka. The earliest literary work in the Ukrainian language was recorded in 1798 when Kotlyarevsky, a playwright from Poltava in southeastern Ukraine, published his epic poem, &quot;Eneyida&quot;, a burlesque in Ukrainian, based on Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. His book was published in vernacular Ukrainian in a satirical way to avoid being censored, and is the earliest known Ukrainian published book to survive through Imperial and, later, Soviet policies on the Ukrainian language.

Kotlyarevsky&#x27;s work and that of another early writer using the Ukrainian vernacular language, Petro Artemovsky, used the southeastern dialect spoken in the Poltava, Kharkiv and southern Kyiven regions of the Russian Empire. This dialect would serve as the basis of the Ukrainian literary language when it was developed by Shevchenko and Kulish in the mid 19th century. In order to raise its status from that of a dialect to that of a language, various elements from folklore and traditional styles were added to it.

The Ukrainian literary language developed further when the Russian state banned the use of the Ukrainian language, prompting many of its writers to move to the western Ukrainian region of Galicia which was under more liberal Austrian rule; after the 1860s the majority of Ukrainian literary works were published in Austrian Galicia. During this period Galician influences were adopted in the Ukrainian literary language, particularly with respect to vocabulary involving law, government, technology, science, and administration.

==Current usage==
The use of the Ukrainian language is increasing after a long period of decline. Although there are almost fifty million ethnic Ukrainians worldwide, including 37.5 million in Ukraine in 2001 (77.8% of the total population at the time), the Ukrainian language is prevalent mainly in western and central Ukraine. In Kyiv, both Ukrainian and Russian are spoken, a notable shift from the recent past when the city was primarily Russian-speaking.

The shift is believed to be caused mainly by an influx of migrants from western regions of Ukraine but also by some Kyivans opting to use the language they speak at home more widely in public settings. Public signs and announcements in Kyiv are displayed in Ukrainian. In southern and eastern Ukraine, Russian is the prevalent language in most large and some small cities. According to the Ukrainian Census of 2001, 87.8% of people living in Ukraine were fluent in Ukrainian.

In August 2022, a survey in Ukraine by Rating Group found that 85% said they speak Ukrainian or Ukrainian and Russian at home, 51% only Ukrainian, an increase from 61% and 44% in February 2014. In the same survey, 76% considered Ukrainian their native language (), up from 57% in July 2012, including 30% of Russian speakers.

===Popular culture===
====Music====
Ukrainian has become popular in other countries through movies and songs performed in the Ukrainian language. The most popular Ukrainian rock bands, such as Okean Elzy, Vopli Vidopliassova, and BoomBox perform regularly in tours across Europe, Israel, North America and especially Russia. In countries with significant Ukrainian populations, bands singing in the Ukrainian language sometimes reach top places on the charts, such as Enej (a band from Poland). Other notable Ukrainian-language bands are The Ukrainians from the United Kingdom, Klooch from Canada, Ukrainian Village Band from the United States, and the Kuban Cossack Choir from the Kuban region in Russia.

====Cinema====
The 2010s saw a revival of Ukrainian cinema. The top Ukrainian-language films (by IMDb rating) are:

====Argots====
Oleksa Horbach&#x27;s 1951 study of argots analyzed historical primary sources (argots of professionals, thugs, prisoners, homeless, school children, etc.) paying special attention to etymological features of argots, word formation and borrowing patterns depending on the source-language (Church Slavonic, Russian, Czech, Polish, Romani, Greek, Romanian, Hungarian, German).

===Dialects===

Several modern dialects of Ukrainian exist.
* dialects:
** is spoken in Chernihiv (excluding the southeastern districts), in the northern part of Sumy, and in the southeastern portion of the Kyiv Oblast as well as in the adjacent areas of Russia, which include the southwestern part of the Bryansk Oblast (the area around Starodub), as well as in some places in the Kursk, Voronezh and Belgorod Oblasts. No linguistic border can be defined. The vocabulary approaches Russian as the language approaches the Russian Federation. Both Ukrainian and Russian grammar sets can be applied to this dialect.
** is spoken in the northwestern part of the Kyiv Oblast, in the northern part of Zhytomyr and the northeastern part of the Rivne Oblast.
** is spoken in the northern part of the Volyn Oblast, the northwestern part of the Rivne Oblast, and in the adjacent districts of the Brest Region in Belarus. The dialect spoken in Belarus uses Belarusian grammar and thus is considered by some to be a dialect of Belarusian.
* dialects:
** is the basis of the Standard Literary Ukrainian. It is spoken in the central part of Ukraine, primarily in the southern and eastern part of the Kyiv Oblast. In addition, the dialects spoken in Cherkasy, Poltava, and Kyiv regions are considered to be close to &quot;standard&quot; Ukrainian.
** is spoken in Kharkiv, Sumy, Luhansk, and the northern part of Donetsk, as well as in the Voronezh and Belgorod regions of Russia. This dialect is formed from a gradual mixture of Russian and Ukrainian, with progressively more Russian in the northern and eastern parts of the region. Thus, there is no linguistic border between Russian and Ukrainian, and, thus, both grammar sets can be applied.
** A dialect is spoken in southern and southeastern Ukraine. This dialect was originally the main language of the Zaporozhian Cossacks.
** A dialect related to or based on the Steppe dialect is often referred to as &quot;Balachka&quot; and is spoken by the Kuban Cossacks in the Kuban region in Russia by the descendants of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, who settled in that area in the late 18th century. It was formed from a gradual mixture of Russian into Ukrainian. This dialect features the use of some Russian vocabulary along with some Russian grammar. There are three main variants, which have been grouped together according to location.
* dialects:
** is spoken by the Boyko people on the northern side of the Carpathian Mountains in the Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblasts. It can also be heard across the border in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship of Poland.
** is spoken by the Hutsul people on the northern slopes of the Carpathian Mountains, in the extreme southern parts of the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, and in parts of the Chernivtsi and Transcarpathian Oblasts.
** is spoken by the Lemko people, whose homeland rests outside the borders of Ukraine in the Prešov Region of Slovakia along the southern side of the Carpathian Mountains, and in the southeast of modern Poland, along the northern sides of the Carpathians.
** is spoken in the southern parts of the Vinnytsia and Khmelnytskyi Oblasts, in the northern part of the Odesa Oblast, and in the adjacent districts of the Cherkasy Oblast, the Kirovohrad Oblast, and the Mykolaiv Oblast.
** is spoken in Rivne and Volyn, as well as in parts of Zhytomyr and Ternopil. It is also used in Chełm, Poland.
** is spoken in the Chernivtsi Oblast of Ukraine. This dialect has some distinct vocabulary borrowed from Romanian.
** (Kresy) is considered to be the main Galician dialect, spoken in the Lviv, Ternopil, and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblasts. Its distinguishing characteristics are the influence of Polish and the German vocabulary, which is reminiscent of the Austro-Hungarian rule. Some of the distinct words used in this dialect can be found here.
** is spoken in the border area between Ukraine and Poland in the San river valley.
* The is considered by Ukrainian linguists to be a dialect of Ukrainian as well:
** is spoken in the Transcarpathian Oblast.
** is spoken in northwestern Serbia and eastern Croatia. Rusin language of the Bačka dialect is one of the official languages of the Serbian Autonomous Province of Vojvodina.
** is the Rusyn spoken in the Prešov (in Ukrainian: Pryashiv) region of Slovakia, as well as by some émigré communities, primarily in the United States of America.

===Neighbouring countries===

All the countries neighbouring Ukraine (except for Hungary) historically have regions with a sizable Ukrainian population and therefore Ukrainian language speakers. Ukrainian is an official minority language in Belarus, Romania, and Moldova.

===Ukrainian diaspora===
Ukrainian is also spoken by a large émigrée population, particularly in Canada, the United States, and several countries of South America like Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. The founders of this population primarily emigrated from Galicia, which used to be part of Austro-Hungary before World War I, and belonged to Poland between the World Wars. The language spoken by most of them is the Galician dialect of Ukrainian from the first half of the 20th century. Compared with modern Ukrainian, the vocabulary of Ukrainians outside Ukraine reflects less influence of Russian, but often contains many loanwords from the local language.

Most of the countries where it is spoken are ex-USSR, where many Ukrainians have migrated. Canada and the United States are also home to a large Ukrainian population. Broken up by country (to the nearest thousand):

# Russia 1,129,838 (according to the 2010 census);
# Canada 200,525 (67,665 spoken at home in 2001, 148,000 spoken as &quot;mother tongue&quot; in 2001)

Ukrainian is declaratively proclaimed as one of three official languages of the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria.

Ukrainian is widely spoken within the 400,000-strong (in 1994) Ukrainian community in Brazil. It is the official language in Prudentópolis alongside Portuguese.

==Language structure==
: &quot;Cyrillic letters in this article are romanized using scientific transliteration.&quot;

===Grammar===
Ukrainian is a fusional, nominative–accusative, satellite-framed language. It exhibits T–V distinction, and is null-subject. The canonical word order of Ukrainian is SVO. Other word orders are common due to the free word order enabled by Ukrainian&#x27;s inflectional system.

Nouns have one of 3 genders: masculine, feminine, neuter; nouns decline for:
* 7 cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, locative, vocative;
* 2 numbers: singular, plural.

Adjectives agree with nouns in gender, case, and number.

Verbs conjugate for:
* 4 tenses: past, pluperfect, present, future;
* 2 voices: active, mediopassive;
* 3 persons: first, second, third;
* 2 numbers: singular, plural.

Ukrainian verbs come in aspect pairs: perfective, and imperfective. Pairs are usually formed by a prepositional prefix and occasionally a root change. The past tense agrees with its subject in number and gender (but &quot;not&quot; person), having developed from the perfect participle.

The Old East Slavic and Russian &quot;o&quot; in syllables ending in a consonant, often correspond to a Ukrainian &quot;i&quot;, as in &quot;pod&quot; → &quot;pid&quot; (під, &#x27;under&#x27;). Thus, in the declension of nouns, the &quot;o&quot; can re-appear when it is no longer located in a closed syllable, such as &quot;rik&quot; (рік, &#x27;year&#x27;) (nom): &quot;rotsi&quot; (loc) (році). Similarly, some words can have &quot;і&quot; in some cases when most of the cases have &quot;o&quot;, for example &quot;слово&quot; (nominative singular), &quot;слова&quot; (nominative plural) but &quot;слiв&quot; (genitive plural).

Ukrainian case endings are somewhat different from Old East Slavic, and the vocabulary includes a large overlay of Polish terminology. Russian &quot;na pervom etaže&quot; &#x27;on the first floor&#x27; is in the locative (prepositional) case. The Ukrainian corresponding expression is &quot;na peršomu poversi&quot; (на першому поверсі). &quot;-omu&quot; is the standard locative (prepositional) ending, but variants in &quot;-im&quot; are common in dialect and poetry, and allowed by the standards bodies. The &quot;kh&quot; of Ukrainian &quot;poverkh&quot; (поверх) has mutated into &quot;s&quot; under the influence of the soft vowel &quot;i&quot; (&quot;k&quot; is similarly mutable into &quot;c&quot; in final positions).

===Phonology===


The Ukrainian language has six vowels, , , , , , .

A number of the consonants come in three forms: hard, soft (palatalized) and long, for example, , , and or , , and .

The letter represents the voiced glottal fricative , often transliterated as Latin &quot;h&quot;. It is the voiced equivalent of English . Russian speakers from Ukraine often use the soft Ukrainian in place of Russian , which comes from northern dialects of Old East Slavic. The Ukrainian alphabet has the additional letter for , which appears in a few native words such as &quot;gryndžoly&quot; &#x27;sleigh&#x27; and &quot;gudzyk&quot; &#x27;button&#x27;. However, appears almost exclusively in loan words, and is usually simply written . For example, loanwords from English on public signs usually use for both English &quot;g&quot; and &quot;h&quot;.

Another phonetic divergence between the Ukrainian and Russian languages is the pronunciation of Cyrillic &quot;v/w&quot;. While in standard Russian it represents , in many Ukrainian dialects it denotes (following a vowel and preceding a consonant (cluster), either within a word or at a word boundary, it denotes the allophone , and like the off-glide in the English words &quot;flow&quot; and &quot;cow&quot;, it forms a diphthong with the preceding vowel). Native Russian speakers will pronounce the Ukrainian as , which is one way to tell the two groups apart. As with above, Ukrainians use to render both English &quot;v&quot; and &quot;w&quot;; Russians occasionally use for &quot;w&quot; instead.

Unlike Russian and most other modern Slavic languages, Ukrainian does not have final devoicing.

===Alphabet===

Ukrainian is written in a version of Cyrillic, consisting of 33 letters, representing 38 phonemes; an apostrophe is also used. Ukrainian orthography is based on the phonemic principle, with one letter generally corresponding to one phoneme, although there are a number of exceptions. The orthography also has cases where the semantic, historical, and morphological principles are applied.

The modern Ukrainian alphabet is the result of a number of proposed alphabetic reforms from the 19th and early 20th centuries, in Ukraine under the Russian Empire, in Austrian Galicia, and later in Soviet Ukraine. A unified Ukrainian alphabet (the &quot;Skrypnykivka&quot;, after Mykola Skrypnyk) was officially established at a 1927 international Orthographic Conference in Kharkiv, during the period of Ukrainization in Soviet Ukraine. But the policy was reversed in the 1930s, and the Soviet Ukrainian orthography diverged from that used by the diaspora. The Ukrainian letter ge &quot;ґ&quot; was banned in the Soviet Union from 1933 until the period of Glasnost in 1990.

The letter щ represents two consonants . The combination of with some of the vowels is also represented by a single letter ( = я, = є, or = ї, = ю), while = йо and the rare regional = йи are written using two letters. These iotated vowel letters and a special soft sign change a preceding consonant from hard to soft. An apostrophe is used to indicate the hardness of the sound in the cases when normally the vowel would change the consonant to soft; in other words, it functions like the yer in the Russian alphabet.

A consonant letter is doubled to indicate that the sound is doubled, or long.

The phonemes and do not have dedicated letters in the alphabet and are rendered with the digraphs дз and дж, respectively. is equivalent to English &quot;ds&quot; in &quot;pods&quot;, is equivalent to &quot;j&quot; in &quot;jump&quot;.

As in Russian, the acute accent may be used to denote vowel stress.

====Transliteration====


===Orthography===
Spelling search, which began in the late 18th century with the emergence of modern literary language, led to the emergence of several spelling options. In particular, there was the spelling system of Oleksii Pavlovskyi, the spelling version of &quot;Mermaid of the Dniester&quot; (1837), Kulishivka (P. Kulish&#x27;s spelling system), Drahomanivka (produced in Kyiv in the 1870s by a group of cultural figures led by linguist P. Zhytetskyi, which included and M. Drahomanov), Zhelekhivka (system of Yevhen Zhelekhovskyi (1886), enshrined in the &quot;Russian Grammar&quot; by Smal-Stotskyi and Theodore Gartner 1893).

Borys Hrinchenko used some corrections in the fundamental four-volume &quot;Dictionary of the Ukrainian Language&quot; (1907–1909). Most of the spelling rules (practically based on phonetics – &quot;write as you hear&quot;) used in Hrinchenko&#x27;s dictionary are still valid. Hrinchenko&#x27;s work became an informal spelling and model for Ukrainian writers and publications from 1907 until the creation of the first official Ukrainian spelling in 1918.

On 17 January 1918, the Central Rada of Ukraine issued the &quot;Main Rules of Ukrainian orthography&quot;, which, however, did not cover the entire scope of the language. On 17 May 1919, the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences approved the &quot;Main Rules of Ukrainian Orthography&quot;, which became the basis for all subsequent revisions and amendments.

On 23 July 1925, the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the USSR decided to organize a State Commission for the Organization of Ukrainian Spelling (State Spelling Commission). It included more than 20 academics from the USSR, who also expressed a desire to invite representatives of Western Ukraine: Smal-Stotskyi, Volodymyr Hnatiuk and Vasyl Simovych.

After almost a year of work in April 1926, the &quot;Project of Ukrainian Spelling&quot; was published to acquaint the general public with the new system. After several months of discussion and consideration of the project at the All-Ukrainian Spelling Conference (26 May – 6 June 1927), the Ukrainian orthography of 1928 was adopted in accordance with the RNC resolution of 6 September 1928. It went down in history as &quot;Kharkiv&quot; or &quot;Skrypnik orthography&quot; – from the place of creation, or from the surname of Skrypnyk.

In 1929, Hryhorii Holoskevych published the &quot;Ukrainian Spelling Dictionary&quot; (about 40,000 words), agreed with the full spelling produced by the State Spelling Commission and approved by the People&#x27;s Commissar for Education (6 September 1928).

In 1933, a spelling commission headed by Andrii Khvylia branded the Ukrainian orthography of 1928 as &quot;nationalist&quot;, immediately stopped publishing any dictionaries, and without any discussion, in a very short time (five months), created a new spelling that unified as never before the Ukrainian and Russian languages. The letter ґ was removed from the alphabet, and Ukrainian scientific terminology was revised and harmonized with Russian-Ukrainian dictionaries (the Institute of Ukrainian Scientific Language was abolished in 1930). This version of the spelling was approved by the resolution of the People&#x27;s Commissar of Education of the USSR of 5 September 1933.

Some minor changes were made in the spelling of 1946 and 1959 (published the following year). It was connected with the document &quot;The rules of Russian spelling and punctuation&quot;, published in 1956. From 1960 until 1990, the 1960 edition was the official standard.

After the beginning of &quot;perestroika&quot;, the issue of improving Ukrainian spelling became relevant again: the editing of the spelling code was started by the Orthographic Commission at the LMM of the USSR Academy of Sciences. The project was also discussed in the newly established Ukrainian Language Society. T. Shevchenko (headed by Dmytro Pavlychko). The new version was approved on 14 November 1989, and published in 1990. The main achievements were the restoration of the letter ґ and the accusative case (in Soviet times it was optional and was called the &quot;accusative form&quot;).

Today, despite the existence of the official spelling of the Ukrainian language, it is not the only spelling standard in use. Even in Ukraine itself, many publishers and publications use other versions of the spelling, which either tend to &quot;skrypnykivka&quot;, or else differ from the official rules of transmission of words of foreign origin.

On 22 May 2019, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine approved a new version of the orthography prepared by the Ukrainian National Commission on Spelling. The new edition brought to life some features of orthography in 1928, which were part of the Ukrainian orthographic tradition. At the same time, the commission was guided by the understanding that the language practice of Ukrainians in the second half of the 20th to the beginning of the 21st century has already become part of the Ukrainian orthographic tradition.

===Vocabulary===
&quot;The Dictionary of the Ukrainian Language&quot;, in 11 volumes, contains 253,000 entries. Lexical card catalog of the Ukrainian Institute of Language Studies has six million cards. As mentioned at the top of the article, Ukrainian is most closely related lexically to Belarusian, and is also closer to Polish than to Russian (for example, можливість, &quot;mozhlyvist″&quot;, &quot;possibility&quot;, and Polish &quot;możliwość&quot;, but Russian возможность, &quot;vozmozhnost&quot;).

===False cognates with Russian===

The standard Ukrainian language which is based on the Kyiv–Poltava dialect has a plethora of false friends with the standard Russian language which is based on the dialect of Moscow. Many people intentionally do or do not use them, causing their language shift into what is known as Surzhyk, where the meaning of some words mimicking Russian could be understood out of context rather than their literal meaning in Ukrainian.
==Classification==

Ukrainian has varying degrees of mutual intelligibility with other Slavic languages. It is closely related to other East Slavic languages with high levels of mutual intelligibility. Ukrainian is considered to be most closely related to Belarusian.

The separation of the East Slavic languages is considered to be relatively recent. In the 19th century, the question of whether the Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian languages are dialects of a single language or three separate languages was actively discussed, with the debate affected by linguistic and political factors. The political situation (Ukraine and Belarus being mainly part of the Russian Empire at the time) and the historical existence of the medieval state of Kievan Rus&#x27;, which occupied large parts of these three nations, led to the creation of the common classification known later as the East Slavic languages. The underlying theory of the grouping is their descent from a common ancestor. In modern times, Ukrainian, Russian, and Belarusian are usually listed by linguists as separate languages.

The Ukrainians were predominantly peasants and petits bourgeois. In 1897, 93% of Ukrainians were classified as peasants. As a result, the Ukrainian language was mostly vernacular and few earlier literary works from the period can be found. In the cities, Ukrainian coexisted with Church Slavonic—a literary language of religion that evolved from Old Church Slavonic—and later Polish and Russian, both languages which were more often used in formal writing and communication during that time.

===Differences from other Slavic languages===
The Ukrainian language has the following similarities with and differences from other Slavic languages:

*Like all Slavic languages with the exception of Russian, Belarusian, standard written Slovak and Slovene, the Ukrainian language has preserved the Common Slavic vocative case. When addressing one&#x27;s sister (&quot;sestra&quot;) she is referred to as &quot;sestro.&quot; In the Russian language the vocative case has been almost entirely replaced by the nominative (except for a handful of vestigial forms, e.g. &quot;Bozhe&quot; &quot;God!&quot; and &quot;Gospodi&quot; &quot;Lord!&quot;).
*The Ukrainian language, in common with all Slavic languages other than Russian, Slovak and Slovene, has retained the Common Slavic second palatalization of the velars *k, *g and *x in front of the secondary vowel *ě of the dative and locative ending in the female declension, resulting in the final sequences -cě, -zě, and -sě. For example, &quot;ruka&quot; (hand) becomes &quot;ruci&quot; in Ukrainian. In Russian, the dative and locative of &quot;ruka&quot; is &quot;ruke.&quot;
*The Ukrainian language, in common with Serbo-Croatian and Slovene, has developed the ending -&quot;mo&quot; for first-person plurals in verbs (&quot;khodymo&quot; for &quot;we walk&quot;). In all cases, it resulted from lengthening of the Common Slavic -&quot;mŭ&quot;.
*The Ukrainian language, along with Russian and Belarusian, has changed the Common Slavic word-initial &quot;ye&quot;- into &quot;o&quot;, such as in the words &quot;ozero&quot; (lake) and &quot;odyn&quot; (one).
*The Ukrainian language, in common with Czech, Slovak, Upper Sorbian, Belarusian and southern Russian dialects, has changed the Common Slavic &quot;g&quot; into an &quot;h&quot; sound (for example, &quot;noha&quot; – leg).
*The Ukrainian language, in common with some northern Russian and Croatian dialects, has transformed the Common Slavic &quot;yě&quot; into &quot;i&quot; (for example, &quot;lis&quot; – forest).
*The Ukrainian language, in common with Russian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Serbo-Croatian, Macedonian, and Slovene, has simplified the Common Slavic &quot;tl&quot; and &quot;dl&quot; into &quot;l&quot; (for example, &quot;mela&quot; – she swept&quot;).
*The Ukrainian language, in common with the most of Slavic ones, is a stress-timed language, in which syllables may last different amounts of time, but there is perceived to be a fairly constant amount of time (on average) between consecutive stressed syllables. 
*The Ukrainian language, in common with all modern Slavic languages other than Bulgarian and Macedonian, does not use articles.
*Other Slavic &quot;o&quot; in closed syllables, i.e., syllables ending in a consonant, in many cases corresponds to a Ukrainian &quot;i&quot;, as in &quot;pod&quot; → &quot;pid&quot; (під, &#x27;under&#x27;). This also includes place names such as Lviv (Львів in Ukrainian), Lwów in Polish, and Львов (Lvov) in Russian.

Unlike all other Slavic languages, Ukrainian has a synthetic future (also termed inflectional future) tense which developed through the erosion and cliticization of the verb &quot;to have&quot; (or possibly &quot;to take&quot;): &quot;pysat-ymu&quot; (infinitive-future-1st sg.) &quot;I will write&quot;. Although the inflectional future (based on the verb &#x27;to have&#x27;) is characteristic of Romance languages, Ukrainian linguist A. Danylenko argues that Ukrainian differs from Romance in the choice of auxiliary, which should be interpreted as &#x27;to take&#x27; and not &#x27;to have.&#x27; He states that Late Common Slavic (LCS) had three verbs with the same Proto-Indo-European root : 
* a determined imperfective LCS *jęti: *jĭmǫ &#x27;to take&#x27; (later superseded by numerous prefixed perfectives)
* an indetermined imperfective LCS *jĭmati: jemljǫ &#x27;to take&#x27; (which would not take any prefixes)
* an imperfective LCS *jĭměti: *jĭmamĭ &#x27;to hold, own, have&#x27;
The three verbs became conflated in East Slavic due to morphological overlap, in particular of *iměti &quot;to have&quot; and *jati &quot;to take&quot; as exemplified in the Middle Ukrainian homonymic imut’ from both iměti (&lt; *jĭměti) and jati (&lt; *jęti). Analogous grammaticalization of the type take (&quot;to take&quot;, &quot;to seize&quot;) &gt; future is found in Chinese and Hungarian.

<text>Father&#x27;s Day is a holiday honoring one&#x27;s father, as well as fatherhood, paternal bonds, and the influence of fathers in society. The holiday complements similar celebrations honoring family members, such as Mother&#x27;s Day and, in some countries, Siblings Day, and Grandparents&#x27; Day. The day is held on various dates across the world, and different regions maintain their own traditions of honoring fatherhood.

In Catholic countries of Europe, it has been celebrated on 19 March as Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day since the Middle Ages. In the United States, Father&#x27;s Day was founded in the state of Washington by Sonora Smart Dodd in 1910. Father&#x27;s Day is a recognized public holiday in Lithuania and some parts of Spain and was regarded as such in Italy until 1977. It is a national holiday in Estonia, Samoa, and equivalently in South Korea, where it is celebrated as Parents&#x27; Day. Sikhs celebrate Father&#x27;s Day (ਪਿਤਾ ਦਿਵਸ) on 29 December, birthday of Guru Gobind Singh.

== History ==
For centuries, the Eastern Orthodox Church has appointed the second Sunday before Nativity as the Sunday of the Forefathers to commemorate the ancestors of Christ according to the flesh, starting with Adam and emphasizing the patriarch Abraham, to whom God said,
This feast can fall between 11 and 17 December. This feast includes the ancestors of Mary, mother of Jesus and various prophets.

A customary day for the celebration of fatherhood in Catholic Europe is known to date back to at least 1508. It is usually celebrated on 19 March, as the feast day of Saint Joseph, who is referred to as the fatherly &quot;Nutritor Domini&quot; (&quot;Nourisher of the Lord&quot;) in Catholicism and &quot;the putative father of Jesus&quot; in southern European tradition. This celebration was brought to the Americas by the Spanish and Portuguese. The Catholic Church actively supported the custom of a celebration of fatherhood on St. Joseph&#x27;s Day from either the last years of the 14th century or from the early 15th century, apparently on the initiative of the Franciscans.

In the Coptic Orthodox Church, the celebration of fatherhood is also observed on St Joseph&#x27;s Day, but the Copts observe this on 20 July. The Coptic celebration may date back to the fifth century.

In the United States, whether to celebrate this day nationwide or not is a matter for debate. In 1908, Grace Golden Clayton proposed the day to honor those men who had died in a mining accident in the US. Though it was not accepted then, in 1909 Sonora Smart Dodd, who along with her five brothers was raised by her father alone, after attending Mother&#x27;s Day in a church, convinced the Spokane Ministerial Association to celebrate Father&#x27;s Day nationwide.

In addition to Father&#x27;s Day, International Men&#x27;s Day is celebrated in many countries on 19 November in honor of both men and boys.

==Spelling==
&quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot; is spelled as a singular possessive following the precedent established by its predecessor, Mother&#x27;s Day. In 1912, Anna Jarvis trademarked the phrase &quot;Second Sunday in May, Mother&#x27;s Day, Anna Jarvis, Founder.&quot; Jarvis specifically noted that &quot;Mother&#x27;s&quot; should &quot;be a singular possessive, for each family to honor its own mother, not a plural possessive commemorating all mothers in the world.&quot;

The celebration of the festival has been modernized in some ways in recent years. Children worship their father on this day, put tika on his forehead and give him sweets, delicacies and gifts as a part of celebration. In return, the father bless good fortune to his children.

On the new moon day (&quot;Amavasya&quot;), it is traditional to pay respect to one&#x27;s deceased father; Hindus go to the Shiva temple of Gokarneswor Mahadev, in Gokarna, a suburb of Kathmandu while Buddhists go to Jana Bahal (Seto Machhendranath or white Tara) temple in Kathmandu.

The eighth day of the eighth month () is a pun for dad ().

===Thailand===
In Thailand, Father&#x27;s Day is observed on 5 December, the birthday of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX).

Traditionally, Thais celebrate by giving their father or grandfather a canna flower (), which is considered a masculine flower; however, this is not as commonly practiced today.

Thais flood the Sanam Luang, a massive park in front of the palace, to watch the king give his annual speech, and often stay until the evening when there is a national ceremony. Thais will light candles and show respect to the king by declaring their faith. This ceremony happens in almost every village in Thailand, and even overseas at Thai organizations.

In 1950, they introduced &quot;la Fête des Pères&quot;, which would take place every third Sunday of June (following the American example). Their slogan is &quot;Nos papas nous l&#x27;ont dit, pour la fête des pères, ils désirent tous un Flaminaire&quot; (Our daddies told us, for Father&#x27;s Day, they all want a Flaminaire). In 1952, the holiday was officially decreed. A national Father&#x27;s Day committee was set up to give a prize for fathers who deserved it most (originally, candidates were nominated by the social services of each town hall&#x27;s/mayor&#x27;s office); This complements &quot;la Fête des Mères&quot; (Mother&#x27;s Day) which was made official in France in 1928 and added to the calendar in Vichy in 1941.

===Germany===
In Germany, Father&#x27;s Day (&quot;Vatertag&quot;) is celebrated differently from other parts of the world, as it is celebrated on Ascension Day (the Thursday forty days after Easter), which is a federal holiday. Regionally, it is also called gentlemen&#x27;s day, &quot;Herrentag&quot; or Männertag (men&#x27;s day). It is a tradition for groups of males (young and old but usually excluding pre-teenage boys) to do a hiking tour with one or more smaller wagons, &quot;Bollerwagen&quot;, pulled by manpower. In the wagons are wine or beer bottles (according to the region) and traditional regional food, &quot;Hausmannskost&quot;. Many men use this holiday as an opportunity to get drunk. According to the Federal Statistical Office of Germany, alcohol-related traffic accidents triple on this day. The tradition of Father&#x27;s Day is especially prevalent in Eastern Germany.

These traditions are probably rooted in Christian Ascension Day&#x27;s processions to the farmlands, which has been celebrated since the 18th century. Men would be seated in a wooden cart and carried to the village&#x27;s plaza, and the mayor would award a prize to the father who had the most children, usually with a big piece of ham. In the late 19th century the religious component was progressively lost, especially in urban areas such as Berlin, and groups of men organized walking excursions with beer and ham. By the 20th century, alcohol consumption had become a major part of the tradition. Many people will take the following Friday off work, and some schools are closed on that Friday as well; many people then use the resulting four-day-long weekend for a short vacation.

==Oceanian traditions==

===Australia===
In Australia, Father&#x27;s Day is celebrated on the first Sunday of September, which is the first Sunday of spring in Australia. Most families present fathers with gifts and cards, and share a meal. It is not a public holiday.

The idea of Father&#x27;s Day wasn&#x27;t initially well received in Australia in the 1910s and 1920s. Many thought it was either unnecessary or undermined a father&#x27;s assumed “supremacy” as head of the household. Newspapers at the time printed satirical poems and critical editorials of the new tradition. Father&#x27;s Day was originally observed in June, matching the USA date, with church services and the wearing of a red flower. In June 1925, Janet Heyden of Sydney (who also advocated for Mother&#x27;s Day celebrations in Australia) began collecting donations to bring cheer to elderly men in nursing/charity homes. While Mother&#x27;s Day became instantly popular, it wasn&#x27;t until the 1930s that Father&#x27;s Day came to be popularly celebrated in Australia on the first Sunday in September. The Father&#x27;s Day Council of Australia was established in 1957 and continues to honor distinguished fathers with an annual Australian Father of the Year award. Father&#x27;s Day traditions in Australia include school crafts with handmade gifts and cards from younger children, taking dad out for lunch, BBQs, and outdoor family activities. Public schools often hold a Father&#x27;s Day gift stall with inexpensive presents for fathers, grandfathers, carers, or other role-models.

YMCA Victoria continues the tradition of honoring the role fathers and father figures play in parenting through the annual awarding of Local Community Father of the Year in 32 municipalities in Victoria. The Father&#x27;s Day Council of Victoria also annually recognizes fathers in the Victorian Father of the Year Award.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, Father&#x27;s Day is celebrated on the first Sunday of September and it is not a public holiday. Father&#x27;s Day was first observed at St Matthew&#x27;s Church, Auckland on 14 July 1929 and first appeared in commercial advertising the following year. By 1931 other churches had adopted the day and in 1935 much of Australia moved to mark the day at the beginning of September. New Zealand followed this, with a Wellington advert in 1937 and a Christchurch Salvation Army service in 1938.

===Samoa===
In Samoa, Father&#x27;s Day is celebrated on the second Sunday in August, and is a recognized national holiday on the Monday following.

===Fiji===

==South American traditions==

===Argentina===
Father&#x27;s Day in Argentina is celebrated on the third Sunday of June.

Attempts have been made to change the date to 24 August, to commemorate the day on which the &quot;Father of the Nation&quot;, José de San Martín, became a father. In 1953, the proposal to celebrate Father&#x27;s Day in all educational establishments on 24 August, in honor of José de San Martín, was raised to the General Direction of Schools of Mendoza Province. The day was celebrated for the first time in 1958, on the third Sunday of June, but it was not included in the school calendars due to pressure from several groups.

Schools in the Mendoza Province continued to celebrate Father&#x27;s Day on 24 August, and in 1982 the provincial governor passed a law declaring Father&#x27;s Day in the province to be celebrated on that day.

In 2004, a proposal to change the date to 24 August was presented to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies as a single, unified project.

===Bolivia===
In Bolivia Father&#x27;s Day (&quot;Día del padre&quot;, in Spanish) is celebrated on 19 March (Saint Joseph Day). People usually give a present to their fathers and spend time with them.

===Brazil===
In Brazil Fathers&#x27; Day (&quot;Dia dos Pais&quot;, in Portuguese a plural form) is celebrated three months after Mother&#x27;s Day, on the second Sunday of August. Publicist Sylvio Bhering picked the day in honor of Saint Joachim, patron of fathers. While it is not an official holiday (see Public holidays in Brazil), it is widely observed and typically involves spending time with and giving gifts to one&#x27;s father or father figure.

===Chile===
In Chile Father&#x27;s Day (&quot;Día del padre&quot;, in Spanish) is officially celebrated on 19 June.

===Colombia===

<doc id="46284" wikidata="Q558933" url="?curid=46284" title="Milton Berle">
<text>Milton Berle (born Mendel Berlinger; ; July 12, 1908 – March 27, 2002) was an American actor and comedian. His career as an entertainer spanned over eight decades, first in silent films and on stage as a child actor, then in radio, movies and television. As the host of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Texaco Star Theatre&quot; (1948–1953), he was the first major American television star and was known to millions of viewers as &quot;Uncle Miltie&quot; and &quot;Mr. Television&quot; during the first Golden Age of Television. He was honored with two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in both radio and TV.

==Early life==
Milton Berle was born into a Jewish family in a five-story walkup in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan. His given name was Mendel Berlinger, but he chose Milton Berle as his professional name when he was 16. His father, Moses Berlinger (1872–1938), was a paint and varnish salesman. His mother, Sarah (Sadie) Glantz Berlinger (1877–1954), changed her name to Sandra Berle when Milton became famous. He had three older brothers (from oldest to youngest): Phil, Frank, and Jack Berle. For many years, the latter two worked on Berle&#x27;s TV production staff while Phil was a programming executive at NBC.

==Child actor==
Berle entered show business in 1913 at the age of five when he won a children&#x27;s Charlie Chaplin contest. He also worked as a child model and was &quot;Buster Brown&quot; for Buster Brown shoes. He appeared as a child actor in silent films. He claimed &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot; as his first film appearance, playing the character of a young boy, although this has never been independently verified. In &quot;Milton Berle: An Autobiography&quot;, he explained that the director told him that he would portray a little boy who would be thrown from a moving train. He said, &quot;I was scared shitless, even when he went on to tell me that Pauline would save my life. This is exactly what happened, except that at the crucial moment they threw a bundle of rags instead of me from the train. I bet there are a lot of comedians around today who are sorry about that.&quot;

By Berle&#x27;s account, he continued to play child roles in other films: &quot;Bunny&#x27;s Little Brother&quot;, &quot;Tess of the Storm Country&quot;, &quot;Birthright&quot;, &quot;Love&#x27;s Penalty&quot;, &quot;Divorce Coupons&quot; and &quot;Ruth of the Range&quot;. Berle recalled, &quot;There were even trips out to Hollywood—the studios paid—where I got parts in &quot;Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm&quot;, with Mary Pickford; &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot;, with Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.; and &quot;Tillie&#x27;s Punctured Romance&quot;, with Charlie Chaplin, Mabel Normand and Marie Dressler.&quot; However, Berle&#x27;s claim to have appeared in &quot;Tillie&#x27;s Punctured Romance&quot; has been disputed by film historians including Glenn Mitchell, who in his book, &quot;The Chaplin Encyclopedia&quot;, writes that Berle&#x27;s alleged role was most likely played by child actor Gordon Griffith.

In 1916, Berle enrolled in the Professional Children&#x27;s School.

==Career==
===Vaudeville===
Around 1920 at age 12, Berle made his stage debut in a revival of the musical comedy &quot;Florodora&quot; in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which later moved to Broadway. By the time he was 16, he was working as a master of ceremonies in vaudeville. He is also known to have played small bit parts in several silent films in the 1910s and 1920s, although his presence in some is disputed (see Filmography, below). In 1932, he starred in Earl Carrol&#x27;s Vanities, a Broadway musical. By the early 1930s, he was a successful stand-up comedian, patterning himself after one of vaudeville&#x27;s top comics, Ted Healy.

===Rising star===
In 1933, Berle was hired by producer Jack White to star in the theatrical featurette &quot;Poppin&#x27; the Cork&quot;, a topical musical comedy concerning the repealing of Prohibition. Berle also co-wrote the score for this film, which was released by Educational Pictures. Berle continued to dabble in songwriting: with Ben Oakland and Milton Drake, he wrote the title song for the RKO Radio Pictures release &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; (1940), an adaptation of Al Capp&#x27;s comic strip, featuring Buster Keaton as Lonesome Polecat. Berle co-wrote a Spike Jones B-side, &quot;Leave the Dishes in the Sink, Ma&quot;.

===Radio===
From 1934 to 1936, Berle appeared frequently on &quot;The Rudy Vallee Hour&quot; and attracted publicity as a regular on &quot;The Gillette Original Community Sing&quot;, a Sunday night comedy-variety program broadcast on CBS from September 6, 1936, to August 29, 1937. In 1939, he was the host of &quot;Stop Me If You&#x27;ve Heard This One&quot; with panelists spontaneously finishing jokes sent in by listeners.

In the late 1940s, he canceled well-paying nightclub appearances to expand his radio career. &quot;Three Ring Time&quot;, a comedy-variety show sponsored by Ballantine Ale, was followed by a 1943 program sponsored by Campbell&#x27;s Soups. The audience participation show &quot;Let Yourself Go&quot; (1944–1945) could best be described as &quot;slapstick radio&quot;, with studio audience members acting out long-suppressed urges—often directed at host Berle. &quot;Kiss and Make Up&quot; on CBS in 1946 featured the problems of contestants decided by a jury from the studio audience with Berle as the judge. Berle also made guest appearances on many comedy-variety radio programs during the 1930s and 1940s.

Scripted by Nat Hiken and Aaron Ruben, &quot;The Milton Berle Show&quot; also featured Arnold Stang, later a familiar face as Berle&#x27;s TV sidekick. Others in the cast were Pert Kelton, Mary Schipp, Jack Albertson, Arthur Q. Bryan, Ed Begley, Brazilian singer Dick Farney and announcer Frank Gallop. Sponsored by Philip Morris, it aired on NBC from March 11, 1947, until April 13, 1948. It ran for an additional season (with new sponsor Texaco), keeping the same format but running concurrently with Berle&#x27;s better known TV series, from September 22, 1948, to June 15, 1949.

Berle later described this series as &quot;the best radio show I ever did ... a hell of a funny variety show&quot;. It served as a springboard for Berle&#x27;s emergence as television&#x27;s first major star.

===Mr. Television===
Berle first appeared on television in 1929 in an experimental broadcast in Chicago which he hosted in front of 129 people. He would return to television 20 years later.

Berle would revive the structure and routines of his vaudeville act for his debut on commercial TV, hosting The &quot;Texaco Star Theatre&quot; on June 8, 1948, over the NBC Television Network. They did not settle on Berle as the permanent host right away; he was originally part of a rotation of hosts (Berle himself had only a four-week contract). Jack Carter was the host for August. Berle was named the permanent host that fall. Berle&#x27;s highly visual style, characterized by vaudeville slapstick and outlandish costumes, proved ideal for the new medium. Berle modeled the show&#x27;s structure and skits directly from his vaudeville shows and hired writer Hal Collins to revive his old routines.

Berle dominated Tuesday night television for the next several years, reaching the number one slot in the Nielsen ratings with as much as a 97% share of the viewing audience. Berle and the show each won Emmy Awards after the first season. Fewer movie tickets were sold on Tuesdays. Some theaters, restaurants, and other businesses shut down for the hour or closed for the evening so their customers would not miss Berle&#x27;s antics. Berle&#x27;s autobiography notes that in Detroit, &quot;an investigation took place when the water levels took a drastic drop in the reservoirs on Tuesday nights between 9 and 9:05. It turned out that everyone waited until the end of the &quot;Texaco Star Theatre&quot; before going to the bathroom.&quot;

Television sales more than doubled after &quot;Texaco Star Theatre&quot;&#x27;s debut, reaching two million in 1949. Berle&#x27;s stature as the medium&#x27;s first superstar earned him the sobriquet &quot;Mr. Television&quot;. He also earned another nickname after ending a 1949 broadcast with a brief ad-libbed remark to children watching the show: &quot;Listen to your Uncle Miltie and go to bed&quot;. Francis Craig and Kermit Goell&#x27;s &quot;Near You&quot; became the theme song that closed Berle&#x27;s TV shows.

Berle risked his newfound TV stardom at its zenith to challenge Texaco when the sponsor tried to prevent black performers from appearing on his show:

I remember clashing with the advertising agency and the sponsor over my signing the Four Step Brothers for an appearance on the show. The only thing I could figure out was that there was an objection to black performers on the show, but I couldn&#x27;t even find out who was objecting. &quot;We just don&#x27;t like them,&quot; I was told, but who the hell was &quot;we?&quot; Because I was riding high in 1950, I sent out the word: &quot;If they don&#x27;t go on, I don&#x27;t go on.&quot; At ten minutes of eight—minutes before showtime—I got permission for the Step Brothers to appear. If I broke the color-line policy or not, I don&#x27;t know, but later on, I had no trouble booking Bill Robinson or Lena Horne.

Berle&#x27;s mother Sadie was often in the audience for his broadcasts; she had long served as a &quot;plant&quot; to encourage laughter from his stage show audiences. Her unique, &quot;piercing, roof-shaking laugh&quot; would stand out, especially when Berle made an entrance in an outrageous costume. After feigning surprise he would &quot;ad-lib&quot; a response; for example: &quot;Lady, you&#x27;ve got all night to make a fool of yourself. I&#x27;ve only got an hour!&quot;

Berle asked NBC to switch from live broadcasts to film, which would have made possible reruns (and residual income from them); he was angered when the network refused. However, NBC did consent to make a kinescope of each show. Later, Berle was offered 25% ownership of the TelePrompTer Corporation by its inventor, Irving Berlin Kahn, if he would replace cue cards with the new device on his program. He turned down the offer.

A frequent user of tranquilizers, Berle frequently endorsed Miltown on his show and became one of its leading advocates in 1950s America. Due to his promotion of the drug, Berle was dubbed &quot;Uncle Miltown&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

For Berle&#x27;s contribution to television, he was inducted to the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.

Berle&#x27;s imperious, abrasive and controlling manner on the show was the inspiration for the 1957 CBS Playhouse 90 production of &quot;The Comedian&quot;. starring Mickey Rooney as egomanaical TV comic Sammy Hogarth, who ran his weekly show through explosive tantrums, intimidation, bullying and cruelty. Writer Ernest Lehman had been assigned to profile Berle for a magazine, and captured Berle&#x27;s high-handedness so completely that the magazine declined to run it, but suggested he fictionalize it and recast it as a novella. When it was picked up for the show, Rod Serling wrote the teleplay. John Frankenheimer directed the live production which received considerable acclaim. The cast included Edmond O&#x27;Brien, Kim Hunter and jazz singer Mel Tormé in his first dramatic role, portraying Hogarth&#x27;s spineless brother Lester. While some speculated the play was based on Jackie Gleason&#x27;s loud, controlling personality, Berle, aware the production echoed his own reputation, was quoted as saying, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t that bad&quot;. The episode won two Emmy Awards.

===TV decline===
In 1951, NBC signed Berle to an unprecedented 30-year exclusive television contract at a million dollars a year.

In 1953, Texaco pulled out of sponsorship of the show but Buick picked it up, prompting a renaming as &quot;The Buick-Berle Show&quot;. The program&#x27;s format was changed to include the backstage preparations for the variety show. Critics generally approved of the changes, but Berle&#x27;s ratings continued to fall, and Buick pulled out after two seasons. In addition, &quot;Berle&#x27;s persona had shifted from the impetuous and aggressive style of the &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot; days to a more cultivated but less distinctive personality, leaving many fans somehow unsatisfied.&quot;

By the time the again-renamed &quot;Milton Berle Show&quot; finished its only full season (1955–56), Berle was already becoming history—though his final season was host to two of Elvis Presley&#x27;s earliest television appearances, April 3 and June 5, 1956. The final straw during that last season may have come from CBS scheduling &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; opposite Berle. Silvers was one of Berle&#x27;s best friends in show business and had come to CBS&#x27;s attention in an appearance on Berle&#x27;s program. &quot;Bilko&#x27;s&quot; creator-producer, Nat Hiken, had been one of Berle&#x27;s radio writers.

Berle knew that NBC had already decided to cancel his show before Presley appeared. He later hosted the first television version of the popular radio variety series, The &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot; from 1958 to 1959, but NBC was finding increasingly fewer showcases for its one-time superstar. By 1960, he was reduced to hosting a bowling program, &quot;Jackpot Bowling&quot;, delivering his quips and interviewing celebrities between the efforts of that week&#x27;s bowling contestants.

===Life after &quot;The Milton Berle Show&quot;===

In Las Vegas, Berle played to packed showrooms at Caesars Palace, the Sands, the Desert Inn, and other casino hotels. Berle had appeared at the El Rancho, the first Las Vegas Strip full service resort, starting in the late 1940s. In addition to constant club appearances, Berle performed on Broadway in Herb Gardner&#x27;s &quot;The Goodbye People&quot; in 1968. He also became a commercial spokesman for the thriving Lum&#x27;s restaurant chain.

He appeared in numerous films, including &quot;Always Leave Them Laughing&quot; (released in 1949, shortly after his TV debut) with Virginia Mayo and Bert Lahr; &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Love&quot; with Marilyn Monroe and Yves Montand; &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World;&quot; &quot;The Loved One;&quot; &quot;The Oscar;&quot; &quot;Who&#x27;s Minding the Mint?;&quot; &quot;Lepke;&quot; Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Broadway Danny Rose;&quot; and &quot;Driving Me Crazy&quot;.

Freed in part from the obligations of his NBC contract, Berle was signed in 1966 to a new weekly variety series on ABC. Unrelated to the 1950s Texaco Star show, the new 1966 ABC series was also called &quot;The Milton Berle Show&quot;. made its debut on September 9, 1966, and ABC announced its cancellation within two months. The show failed to capture a large audience and was canceled after half a season. with the final show running on January 6, 1967. Berle later appeared as guest villain Louie the Lilac on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; series. Other appearances included stints on &quot;The Barbara Stanwyck Show&quot;, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, &quot;Get Smart&quot;, &quot;Laugh-In&quot;, &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;, &quot;Ironside&quot;, &quot;F Troop&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;, &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, &quot;CHiPs&quot;, &quot;The Muppet Show,&quot; and &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;.

Like his contemporary Jackie Gleason, Berle proved a solid dramatic actor and was acclaimed for several such performances, most notably his lead role in &quot;Doyle Against the House&quot; on &quot;The Dick Powell Show&quot; in 1961, a role for which he received an Emmy nomination. He also played the part of a blind survivor of an airplane crash in &quot;Seven in Darkness&quot;, the first in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Movie of the Week&quot; series. He also played a dramatic role as a talent agent in &quot;The Oscar&quot; (1966) and was one of the few actors in that movie to get good notices from critics.

During this period, Berle was named to the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; for the greatest number of charity performances made by a show-business performer. Unlike the high-profile shows done by Bob Hope to entertain the troops, Berle did more shows, over a period of 50 years, on a lower-profile basis. Berle received an award for entertaining at stateside military bases in World War I as a child performer, in addition to traveling to foreign bases during World War II and the Vietnam War. The first charity telethon (for the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation) was hosted by Berle in 1949. A permanent fixture at charity benefits in the Hollywood area, he was instrumental in raising millions for charitable causes.

===Late career===
On April 14, 1979, Berle guest-hosted NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Berle&#x27;s long reputation for taking control of an entire television production—whether invited to do so or not—was a cause of stress on the set. In addition, he appeared skeptical about the show&#x27;s satirical bent. One of the show&#x27;s writers, Rosie Shuster, described the rehearsals for the Berle &quot;SNL&quot; show and the telecast as &quot;watching a comedy train accident in slow motion on a loop.&quot; Upstaging, camera mugging, doing spit-takes, inserting old comedy bits, and climaxing the show with a maudlin performance of &quot;September Song&quot; complete with a pre-arranged standing ovation (something producer Lorne Michaels had never sanctioned) resulted in Berle being banned from hosting the show again. The episode was also barred from being rerun until surfacing in 2003 because Michaels thought it brought down the show&#x27;s reputation.

As a guest star on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, Berle was memorably upstaged by the heckling theater critics Statler and Waldorf. The Statler and Waldorf puppets were inspired by a character named Sidney Spritzer, played by comedian Irving Benson, who regularly heckled Berle from a box seat during episodes of the 1960s ABC series. Milton Berle also made a cameo appearance in &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; as a used car dealer, taking Fozzie Bear&#x27;s 1951 Studebaker in trade for a station wagon. 

In 1974, Berle had a minor altercation with a younger actor/comedian Richard Pryor when both appeared as guests on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;. At the time, Berle was discussing the emotional fallout from an experience he had with impregnating a woman with whom he was not married, having to then decide whether or not they would keep the child. During his talk, Pryor let out a laugh, to which Berle took exception and confronted him, stating, &quot;I wish, I wish, Richard, that I could have laughed at that time at your age when I was your age, the way you just laughed now, but I just couldn&#x27;t ... I told you this nine years ago, and now I&#x27;ll tell you on the air in front of millions of people: Pick your spots, baby.&quot; This prompted Pryor to mockingly quip back, &quot;All right, sweetheart&quot; in a Humphrey Bogart voice.
Another well-known incident of upstaging occurred during the 1982 Emmy Awards, when Berle and Martha Raye were the presenters of the Emmy for Outstanding Writing. Berle was reluctant to give up the microphone as the award&#x27;s numerous recipients from &quot;Second City Television&quot; (SCTV) flooded the stage. Berle interrupted actor/writer Joe Flaherty&#x27;s acceptance speech several times, with comments like, &quot;Hurry up, we&#x27;re 15 minutes over.&quot; After Flaherty made a joke about the size of the &quot;SCTV&quot; crew rivaling &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, Berle replied sarcastically, &quot;That&#x27;s funny.&quot; Flaherty&#x27;s follow-up response of &quot;Sorry, Uncle Miltie ... go to sleep,&quot; flustered Berle.

In 1984, Berle appeared in drag in the video for &quot;Round and Round&quot; by the 1980s metal band Ratt (his nephew Marshall Berle was then their manager). He also made a brief appearance in the band&#x27;s &quot;Back For More&quot; video as a motorcyclist.

In 1985, he appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; (created by Steven Spielberg) in the episode &quot;Fine Tunin&#x27;&quot;. In it, friendly aliens from space receive TV signals from the Earth of the 1950s and travel to Hollywood in search of their idols, Lucille Ball, Jackie Gleason, The Three Stooges, Burns and Allen, and Milton Berle. When Berle realizes the aliens are doing his old material, Uncle Miltie is thunderstruck: &quot;Stealing from Berle? Is that even possible?&quot; Speaking gibberish, Berle is the only person able to communicate directly with the aliens.

One of Berle&#x27;s most popular performances in his later years was guest-starring in 1992 in &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; alongside Will Smith as womanizing, wise-cracking patient Max Jakey. Most of his dialogue was improvised and he shocked the studio audience by mistakenly blurting out a curse word. He also appeared in an acclaimed and Emmy-nominated turn on &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; as an aging comedian befriended by Steve Sanders, who idolizes him, but is troubled by his bouts of senility due to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He also voiced the Prince of Darkness, the main antagonist in the Canadian animated television anthology special &quot;The Real Story of Au Clair De La Lune&quot;. He appeared in 1995 as a guest star in an episode of &quot;The Nanny&quot; as her lawyer and great uncle.

In 1994, Berle released a fitness videotape titled &quot;Milton Berle&#x27;s Low Impact/High Comedy Workout&quot; which was targeted towards seniors.

Berle was again on the receiving end of an onstage gibe at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards when RuPaul responded to Berle&#x27;s reference of having once worn dresses himself (during his old television days) with the quip that Berle now wore diapers. A surprised Berle replied by recycling a line he had delivered to Henny Youngman on his &quot;Hollywood Palace&quot; show in 1966: &quot;Oh, we&#x27;re going to ad lib? I&#x27;ll check my brain and we&#x27;ll start even.&quot;

==Berle offstage==

In 1947, Milton Berle was one of the founding members of the Friars Club of Beverly Hills at the old Savoy Hotel on Sunset Boulevard. In 1961, the club moved to Beverly Hills. The Friars is a private show business club famous for its celebrity members and roasts, where a member is mocked by his club friends in good fun.

Berle avoided consuming drugs and alcohol, but was an avid cigar smoker, womanizer, and gambler; primarily gambling on horse racing. His proclivity for the latter may have been responsible for Berle never equaling the wealth of many of his contemporaries.

Although Berle &quot;worked clean&quot; for his entire career, excluding the Friars Club private celebrity roasts, he reportedly used profane language extensively in private.

=== Purported penis size ===
Berle was famous within show business for the rumored size of his penis. Phil Silvers once told a story about standing next to Berle at a urinal, glancing down, and quipping, &quot;You&#x27;d better feed that thing, or it&#x27;s liable to turn on you!&quot;. In the short story &quot;A Beautiful Child&quot;, Truman Capote wrote Marilyn Monroe as saying, &quot;Christ! Everybody says Milton Berle has the biggest schlong in Hollywood.&quot; At a memorial service for Berle at the New York Friars&#x27; Club, Freddie Roman solemnly announced, &quot;On May 1st and May 2nd, his penis will be buried&quot;. In 2023, on episode 1478 of &quot;WTF with Marc Maron&quot;, Arnold Schwarzenegger recalled how he joked during Berle&#x27;s eulogy, saying, &quot;Look, even though the son of a bitch is dead, they still had a difficult time putting the top on his casket&quot;.

Radio shock jock Howard Stern barraged Berle with an array of penis questions during his appearances on Stern&#x27;s morning talk show in 1988 and 1996. In Berle&#x27;s 1988 appearance, when fielding phone calls, Stern purposely asked his producer to air only callers whose questions dealt with Berle&#x27;s penis. In his autobiography, Berle tells of a man who accosted him in a steam bath and challenged him to compare sizes, leading a bystander to remark, &quot;Go ahead, Milton, just take out enough to win&quot;. Berle attributed this line to comedian Jackie Gleason and said, &quot;It was maybe the funniest spontaneous line I ever heard&quot;. In the oral history &quot;Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;SNL&quot; writer Alan Zweibel describes how Berle opened his bathrobe in his dressing room to show his penis size to Zweibel, only to have cast member Gilda Radner walk into an uncomfortable scene.

==Personal life==

After twice marrying and divorcing showgirl Joyce Mathews, Berle married publicist Ruth Cosgrove ( Rosenthal) in 1953; she died of cancer in 1989. In 1989, Berle stated that his mother was behind the breakup of his marriages to Mathews. He also said that she managed to damage his previous relationships: &quot;My mother never resented me going out with a girl, but if I had more than three dates with one girl, Mama found some way to break it up.&quot; He married a fourth time in 1992 to Lorna Adams, a fashion designer 30 years his junior. He had three children, Victoria (adopted by Berle and Mathews), William (adopted by Berle and Cosgrove) and a biological son, Bob Williams, with showgirl Junior Standish &quot;(née&quot; Jean Dunne Arthur; 1925–2006). Berle had two stepdaughters from his marriage to Adams: Leslie and Susan Brown. He also had three grandchildren: Victoria&#x27;s sons James and Mathew, and William&#x27;s son Tyler Daniel Roe, who died in 2014.

Berle&#x27;s autobiography contains many tales of his sexual exploits. He claimed relationships with numerous famous women including Marilyn Monroe and Betty Hutton, columnist Dorothy Kilgallen, and evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. The veracity of some of these claims has been questioned. The McPherson story, in particular, has been challenged by McPherson&#x27;s biographer and her daughter, among others.

In later life, Berle found comfort in Christian Science and subsequently characterized himself as &quot;a Jew and a Christian Scientist.&quot; Oscar Levant, when queried by Jack Paar about Berle&#x27;s adoption of Christian Science, quipped, &quot;Our loss is their loss.&quot;

Berle was a Democrat who endorsed Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election.

==Final role and death==

Berle guest-starred as Uncle Leo in the &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot; special &quot;Two Heads Are Better than None&quot;, which premiered in 2000. This would be his last acting role.

In April 2001, Berle announced that a malignant tumor had been found in his colon, but he had declined surgery. Berle&#x27;s wife said the tumor was growing so slowly that it would take 10 to 12 years to affect him in any significant or life-threatening way. However, one year after the announcement, on March 27, 2002, Berle died in Los Angeles from colon cancer. He died on the same day as Dudley Moore and Billy Wilder.

Berle reportedly left arrangements to be buried with his second wife, Ruth, at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Burbank, but his body was cremated and interred at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City. (Warren Cowan, Berle&#x27;s publicist, told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;I only know he told me he bought plots at Hillside, and it was his idea.&quot;) In addition to his third wife, Lorna Adams, Berle was survived by his three children and extended family.

<text>Long John Silver&#x27;s, formerly known as Long John Silver&#x27;s Seafood Shoppes and sometimes abbreviated as LJS, is an American chain of fast-food restaurants that specializes in seafood. The brand&#x27;s name is derived from the character of the same name from Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s novel &quot;Treasure Island&quot;.

In November 2022, Long John Silver&#x27;s was acquired by Four Oaks Partners, a group of investors led by Bob Jenkins, himself a Long John Silver&#x27;s franchisee and president of Charter Foods.

==History==
Long John Silver&#x27;s was founded in 1969 by Jim Patterson in Lexington, Kentucky. The original location, on 301 Southland Drive, was previously the Cape Codder seafood carry-out restaurant. The original Cape Codder concrete block building was redesigned by architect Druce Henn, who created the New England style of Long John Silver&#x27;s early chain restaurants. That original location is now a styling salon.

Earlier restaurants were known for their Cape Cod style buildings, blue roofs with square cupolas, wood benches/tables, lobster pots, and ship&#x27;s wheels. Later, more nautically themed decorations were added such as seats made to look like nautical flags.

The restaurant chain arrived in Singapore in 1983 and has had a continuous presence in the country ever since. It remains one of 30 countries outside of the United States to have Long John Silver&#x27;s outlets.

Early restaurants also featured separate entrance and exit doors, a -like waiting line area, deep fryers with food heaters that were transparent so customers could view the food to be served, and wrought iron &#x27;sword&#x27; door handles. These buildings had dock-like walkways, lined with pilings and thick ropes.

Long John Silver&#x27;s was acquired by Jerrico in 1988. Jerrico was taken private in 1989 through a highly leveraged management buyout, and one year later, the other restaurant concepts were divested to focus on Long John Silver&#x27;s.

After struggling for the next several years under its heavy debt load, Jerrico Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 1998. In September 1999, A&amp;W announced to acquire the chain out of bankruptcy. As a result, Yorkshire Global Restaurants was formed.

In 2000, Yorkshire Global Restaurants agreed to test multi-branded locations with Louisville, Kentucky-based Tricon Global, owner of the KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell chains.

The parent company of Long John Silver&#x27;s and A&amp;W, Yorkshire was acquired by Tricon Global and Tricon was renamed Yum! Brands, Inc in May 2002. By January 2011, Yum! announced it was seeking a buyer for its Long John Silver&#x27;s and A&amp;W All-American Restaurants divisions, citing poor sales and a desire to shift its focus to international expansion.

In September 2011, Yum! announced the impending sale of Long John Silver&#x27;s to LJS Partners – a group consisting of franchisees and other private investors.

In July 2013, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nutrition and health policy watchdog group, named Long John Silver&#x27;s &quot;Big Catch&quot; meal the worst restaurant meal in America, noting that it contained 33 grams of trans fat, 19 grams of saturated fat, 1,320 calories, and almost 3,700 milligrams of sodium. The company announced that it had eliminated trans fats from its menu by January 2014.

In March 2015, James O&#x27;Reilly, who had previously worked for KFC (another Yum! Brands holding), was appointed as the CEO. He stated that he expected the chain to maintain its 1,132 stores, refocus its marketing following negative press about the fat and sodium content of the menu, and looked to the possibility of future expansion.

On May 22, 2018, Long John Silver&#x27;s announced the acquisition of 76 franchised restaurants, primarily owned and renovated by ServUS, located primarily in Indiana. On October 19, 2019, Warren W. Rosenthal, former president of Jerrico and developer of 1,350 Long John Silver&#x27;s restaurants, died, aged 96.

On January 18, 2021, Long John Silver&#x27;s announced Blain Shortreed to take over as CEO.

<doc id="46289" wikidata="Q129165" url="?curid=46289" title="Xerxes I">
<text>Xerxes I ( – August 465 BC), commonly known as Xerxes the Great, was a Persian ruler who served as the fourth King of Kings of the Achaemenid Empire, reigning from 486 BC until his assassination in 465 BC. He was the son of Darius the Great and Atossa, a daughter of Cyrus the Great. 

In Western history, Xerxes is best known for his invasion of Greece in 480 BC, which ended in Persian defeat. Xerxes was designated successor by Darius over his elder brother Artobazan and inherited a large, multi-ethnic empire upon his father&#x27;s death. He consolidated his power by crushing revolts in Egypt and Babylon, and renewed his father&#x27;s campaign to subjugate Greece and punish Athens and its allies for their interference in the Ionian Revolt. In 480 BC, Xerxes personally led a large army and crossed the Hellespont into Europe. He achieved victories at Thermopylae and Artemisium before capturing and razing Athens. His forces gained control of mainland Greece north of the Isthmus of Corinth until their defeat at the Battle of Salamis. Fearing that the Greeks might trap him in Europe, Xerxes retreated with the greater part of his army back to Asia, leaving behind Mardonius to continue his campaign. Mardonius was defeated at Plataea the following year, effectively ending the Persian invasion.

After returning to Persia, Xerxes dedicated himself to large-scale construction projects, many of which had been left unfinished by his father. He oversaw the completion of the Gate of All Nations, the Apadana and the Tachara at Persepolis, and continued the construction of the Palace of Darius at Susa. He also maintained the Royal Road built by his father. In 465 BC, Xerxes and his heir Darius were assassinated by Artabanus, the commander of the royal bodyguard. He was succeeded by his third son, who took the throne as Artaxerxes I.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Xérxēs&quot; () is the Greek and Latin (&quot;Xerxes&quot;, &quot;Xerses&quot;) transliteration of the Old Iranian &quot;Xšaya-ṛšā&quot; (&quot;ruling over heroes&quot;), which can be seen by the first part &quot;xšaya&quot;, meaning &quot;ruling&quot;, and the second &quot;ṛšā&quot;, meaning &quot;hero, man&quot;. The name of Xerxes was known in Akkadian as &quot;Ḫi-ši-ʾ-ar-šá&quot; and in Aramaic as &quot;ḥšyʾrš&quot;. Xerxes would become a popular name among the rulers of the Achaemenid Empire.

== Early life ==
=== Parentage and birth ===
Xerxes&#x27; father was Darius the Great (), the incumbent monarch of the Achaemenid Empire, albeit himself not a member of the family of Cyrus the Great, the founder of the empire. Xerxes&#x27; mother was Atossa, a daughter of Cyrus. Darius and Atossa married in 522 BC, and Xerxes was born around 518 BC.

=== Upbringing and education ===

According to the Greek dialogue First Alcibiades, which describes typical upbringing and education of Persian princes, they were raised by eunuchs. Starting at the age of seven, they learned how to ride and hunt; after reaching the age of fourteen, they were each taught by four teachers from aristocratic backgrounds, who taught them how to be &quot;wise, just, prudent, and brave.&quot; Persian princes also learned the basics of the Zoroastrian religion, and were taught to be truthful, to be courageous, and to have self-restraint. The dialogue further added that &quot;fear, for a Persian, is the equivalent of slavery.&quot; At the age of 16 or 17, they began their mandatory 10 years of national service, which included practicing archery and javelin, competing for prizes, and hunting. Afterwards, they served in the military for around 25 years, after which they were elevated to the status of elders and advisers to the king. Families in this time, including Xerxes&#x27;, would intermarry.

This account of education among the Persian elite is supported by Xenophon&#x27;s description of the 5th-century BC Achaemenid prince Cyrus the Younger, with whom he was well-acquainted. Stoneman suggests that this was the type of upbringing and education that Xerxes experienced. It is unknown if Xerxes ever learned to read or write, with the Persians favoring oral history over written literature. Stoneman suggests that Xerxes&#x27; upbringing and education was possibly not much different from that of the later Iranian kings, such as Abbas the Great, king of the Safavid Empire in the 17th-century AD. Starting from 498 BC, Xerxes resided in the royal palace of Babylon.

===Accession to the throne===
While Darius was preparing for another war against Greece, a revolt began in Egypt in 486 BC due to heavy taxes and the deportation of craftsmen to build the royal palaces at Susa and Persepolis. The king was required by Persian law to choose a successor before setting out on dangerous expeditions; when Darius decided to leave for Egypt (487–486 BC), he prepared his tomb at Naqsh-e Rustam (five kilometers from his royal palace at Persepolis) and appointed Xerxes, his eldest son by Atossa, as his successor. However, Darius could not lead the campaign due to his failing health; he died in October 486 BC at the age of 64.

Artobazan claimed that he should take the crown as the eldest of all Darius&#x27; children, while Xerxes argued for his own claim on the grounds that he was the son of Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus, and that Cyrus had won the Persians their freedom. Xerxes&#x27; claim was supported by a Spartan king in exile who was present in Persia at the time, the Eurypontid king Demaratus, who also argued that the eldest son did not universally have the best claim to the crown, citing Spartan law, which stated that the first son born while the father is king was the heir to the kingship. Some modern scholars also view the unusual decision of Darius to give the throne to Xerxes as a result of his consideration of the particular prestige that Cyrus the Great and his daughter Atossa enjoyed. Artobazan was born to &quot;Darius the subject&quot;, while Xerxes was the eldest son &quot;born in the purple&quot; after Darius&#x27; rise to the throne. Furthermore, while Artobazan&#x27;s mother was a commoner, Xerxes&#x27; mother was the daughter of the founder of the Achaemenid Empire.

Xerxes was crowned and succeeded his father in October–December 486 BC when he was about 32 years old. The transition of power to Xerxes was smooth, due again in part to the great authority of Atossa and his accession to royal power was not challenged by any person at court or in the Achaemenian family, or by any subject nation.

== Consolidation of power ==

At the time of Xerxes&#x27; accession, trouble was brewing in some of his domains. A revolt occurred in Egypt, which seemed dangerous enough for Xerxes to personally lead the army to restore order (which also gave him the opportunity to begin his reign with a military campaign). Xerxes suppressed the revolt in January 484 BC and appointed his full-brother Achaemenes as satrap of Egypt, replacing the previous satrap Pherendates, who was reportedly killed during the revolt. The suppression of the Egyptian revolt expended the army, which had been mobilized by Darius over the previous three years. Xerxes, therefore, had to raise another army for his expedition into Greece, which took another four years. There was also unrest in Babylon, which revolted at least twice against Xerxes during his reign. The first revolt broke out in June or July of 484 BC and was led by a rebel of the name Bel-shimanni. Bel-shimmani&#x27;s revolt was short-lived; Babylonian documents written during his reign only account for a period of two weeks.

Two years later, Babylon produced another rebel leader, Shamash-eriba. Beginning in the summer of 482 BC, Shamash-eriba seized Babylon itself and other nearby cities, such as Borsippa and Dilbat, and was only defeated in March 481 BC after a lengthy siege of Babylon. The precise cause of the unrest in Babylon is uncertain. It may have been due to tax increases. Prior to these revolts, Babylon had occupied a special position within the Achaemenid Empire; the Achaemenid kings had held the titles of &quot;King of Babylon&quot; and &quot;King of the Lands,&quot; implying that they perceived Babylonia as a somewhat separate entity within their empire, united with their own kingdom in a personal union. After the revolts, however, Xerxes dropped &quot;King of Babylon&quot; from his titulature and divided the previously large Babylonian satrapy (accounting for most of the Neo-Babylonian Empire&#x27;s territory) into smaller sub-units.

Based on texts written by classical authors, it is often assumed that Xerxes enacted a brutal vengeance on Babylon following the two revolts. According to ancient writers, Xerxes destroyed Babylon&#x27;s fortifications and damaged the temples in the city. The Esagila was allegedly subject to great damage, and Xerxes allegedly carried the statue of Marduk away from the city, possibly bringing it to Iran and melting it down (classical authors hold that the statue was made entirely of gold, which would have made melting it down possible). Modern historian Amélie Kuhrt considers it unlikely that Xerxes destroyed the temples, but believes that the story of him doing so may derive from an anti-Persian sentiment among the Babylonians. It is doubtful if the statue was removed from Babylon at all and some have even suggested that Xerxes did remove a statue from the city, but that this was the golden statue of a man rather than the statue of the god Marduk. Though mentions of it are lacking considerably compared to earlier periods, contemporary documents suggest that the Babylonian New Year&#x27;s Festival continued in some form during the Achaemenid period. Because the change in rulership from the Babylonians themselves to the Persians and due to the replacement of the city&#x27;s elite families by Xerxes following its revolt, it is possible that the festival&#x27;s traditional rituals and events had changed considerably.

==Campaigns==
===Invasion of the Greek mainland===
Darius died while in the process of preparing a second army to invade the Greek mainland, leaving to his son the task of punishing the Athenians, Naxians, and Eretrians for their interference in the Ionian Revolt, the burning of Sardis, and their victory over the Persians at Marathon. From 483 BC, Xerxes prepared his expedition: The Xerxes Canal was dug through the isthmus of the peninsula of Mount Athos, provisions were stored in the stations on the road through Thrace, and two pontoon bridges later known as Xerxes&#x27; Pontoon Bridges were built across the Hellespont. Soldiers of many nationalities served in the armies of Xerxes from all over his multi-ethnic massive Eurasian-sized empire and beyond, including the Assyrians, Phoenicians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Jews, Macedonians, European Thracians, Paeonians, Achaean Greeks, Ionians, Aegean islanders, Aeolians, Greeks from Pontus, Colchians, Sindhis and many more.

According to the Greek historian Herodotus, Xerxes&#x27;s first attempt to bridge the Hellespont ended in failure when a storm destroyed the flax and papyrus cables of the bridges. In retaliation, Xerxes ordered the Hellespont (the strait itself) whipped three hundred times, and had fetters thrown into the water. Xerxes&#x27;s second attempt to bridge the Hellespont was successful. The Carthaginian invasion of Sicily deprived Greece of the support of the powerful monarchs of Syracuse and Agrigentum; ancient sources assume Xerxes was responsible, modern scholarship is skeptical. Many smaller Greek states, moreover, took the side of the Persians, especially Thessaly, Thebes and Argos. Xerxes was victorious during the initial battles.

Xerxes set out in the spring of 480 BC from Sardis with a fleet and army which Herodotus estimated was roughly one million strong along with 10,000 elite warriors named the Immortals. More recent estimates place the Persian force at around 60,000 combatants.

===Battle of Thermopylae and destruction of Athens===

At the Battle of Thermopylae, a small force of Greek warriors led by King Leonidas of Sparta resisted the much larger Persian forces, but were ultimately defeated. According to Herodotus, the Persians broke the Spartan phalanx after a Greek man called Ephialtes betrayed his country by telling the Persians of another pass around the mountains. At Artemisium, large storms had destroyed ships from the Greek side and so the battle stopped prematurely as the Greeks received news of the defeat at Thermopylae and retreated.
After Thermopylae, Athens was captured. Most of the Athenians had abandoned the city and fled to the island of Salamis before Xerxes arrived. A small group attempted to defend the Athenian Acropolis, but they were defeated. Xerxes ordered the Destruction of Athens and burnt the city, leaving an archaeologically attested destruction layer, known as the Perserschutt. The Persians thus gained control of all of mainland Greece to the north of the Isthmus of Corinth.

===Battles of Salamis and Plataea===
Xerxes was induced, by the message of Themistocles (against the advice of Artemisia of Halicarnassus), to attack the Greek fleet under unfavourable conditions, rather than sending a part of his ships to the Peloponnesus and awaiting the dissolution of the Greek armies. The Battle of Salamis (September, 480 BC) was won by the Greek fleet, after which Xerxes set up a winter camp in Thessaly.

According to Herodotus, fearing that the Greeks might attack the bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe, Xerxes decided to retreat back to Asia, taking the greater part of the army with him. Another cause of the retreat might have been that the continued unrest in Babylon, a key province of the empire, required the king&#x27;s personal attention.
He left behind a contingent in Greece to finish the campaign under Mardonius, who according to Herodotus had suggested the retreat in the first place. This force was defeated the following year at Plataea by the combined forces of the Greek city states, ending the Persian offensive on Greece for good.

==Construction projects==

After his military blunders in Greece, Xerxes returned to Persia and oversaw the completion of the many construction projects left unfinished by his father at Susa and Persepolis. He oversaw the building of the Gate of All Nations and the Hall of a Hundred Columns at Persepolis, which are the largest and most imposing structures of the palace. He oversaw the completion of the Apadana, the Tachara (Palace of Darius) and the Treasury, all started by Darius, as well as having his own palace built which was twice the size of his father&#x27;s. His taste in architecture was similar to that of Darius, though on an even more gigantic scale. He had colorful enameled brick laid on the exterior face of the Apadana. He also maintained the Royal Road built by his father and completed the Susa Gate and built a palace in Susa.

==Death and succession==

In August 465 BC, Artabanus, the commander of the royal bodyguard and the most powerful official in the Persian court, assassinated Xerxes with the help of a eunuch, Aspamitres. Although the Hyrcanian Artabanus bore the same name as the famed uncle of Xerxes, his rise to prominence was due to his popularity in religious quarters of the court and harem intrigues. He put his seven sons in key positions and had a plan to dethrone the Achaemenids.

Greek historians give differing accounts of events. According to Ctesias (in Persica 20), Artabanus then accused the Crown Prince Darius, Xerxes&#x27;s eldest son, of the murder and persuaded another of Xerxes&#x27;s sons, Artaxerxes, to avenge the patricide by killing Darius. But according to Aristotle (in Politics 5.1311b), Artabanus killed Darius first and then killed Xerxes. After Artaxerxes discovered the murder, he killed Artabanus and his sons. Participating in these intrigues was the general Megabyzus, whose decision to switch sides probably saved the Achaemenids from losing their control of the Persian throne.

==Religion==
While there is no general consensus in scholarship as to whether Xerxes and his predecessors had been influenced by Zoroastrianism, it is well established that Xerxes was a firm believer in Ahura Mazda, whom he saw as the supreme deity. However, Ahura Mazda was also worshipped by adherents of the (Indo-)Iranian religious tradition. On his treatment of other religions, Xerxes followed the same policy as his predecessors: he appealed to local religious scholars, made sacrifices to local deities, and destroyed temples in cities and countries that caused disorder.

== Reception ==

Xerxes&#x27; presentation in Greek and Roman sources is largely negative and this set the tone for most subsequent depictions of him within the western tradition. Xerxes is a central character of Aeschylus&#x27; play &quot;The Persians&quot;, first performed in Athens in 472 BC, only seven years after his invasion of Greece. The play presents him as an effeminate figure and his hubristic effort to bring both Asia and Europe under his control leads to the ruin of both himself and his kingdom.

Herodotus&#x27;s &quot;Histories&quot;, written later in the fifth century BC, centre on the Persian Wars, with Xerxes as a major figure. Some of Herodotus&#x27; information is spurious. Pierre Briant has accused him of presenting a stereotyped and biased portrayal of the Persians. Richard Stoneman regards his portrayal of Xerxes as nuanced and tragic, compared to the vilification that he suffered at the hands of the Macedonian king Alexander the Great ().

Xerxes is identified with the king Ahasuerus in the biblical Book of Esther, which some scholars, including Eduard Schwartz, William Rainey Harper, and Michael V. Fox, consider to be historical romance. There is nothing close to a consensus, however, as to what historical event provided the basis for the story.

Xerxes is the protagonist of the opera &quot;Serse&quot; by the German-English Baroque composer George Frideric Handel. It was first performed in the King&#x27;s Theatre London on 15 April 1738. The famous aria opens the opera.

The murder of Xerxes by Artabanus (&quot;Artabano&quot;), execution of crown prince Darius (&quot;Dario&quot;), revolt by Megabyzus (&quot;Megabise&quot;), and subsequent succession of Artaxerxes I is romanticised by the Italian poet Metastasio in his opera libretto &quot;Artaserse&quot; (1730), which was first set to music by Leonardo Vinci, and subsequently by other composers such as Johann Adolf Hasse and Johann Christian Bach.

The historical novel &quot;Xerxes of de Hoogmoed&quot; (1919) by Dutch writer Louis Couperus describes the Persian wars from the perspective of Xerxes. Though the account is fictionalised, Couperus nevertheless based himself on an extensive study of Herodotus. The English translation &quot;Arrogance: The Conquests of Xerxes&quot; by Frederick H. Martens appeared in 1930.
Later generations&#x27; fascination with ancient Sparta, particularly the Battle of Thermopylae, has led to Xerxes&#x27; portrayal in works of popular culture. He was played by David Farrar in the film &quot;The 300 Spartans&quot; (1962), where he is portrayed as a cruel, power-crazed despot and an inept commander. He also features prominently in the graphic novels &quot;300&quot; and &quot;&quot; by Frank Miller, as well as the film adaptation &quot;300&quot; (2007) and its sequel &quot;300: Rise of an Empire&quot; (2014), as portrayed by Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro, in which he is represented as a giant man with androgynous qualities, who claims to be a god-king. This portrayal attracted controversy, especially in Iran. Ken Davitian plays Xerxes in &quot;Meet the Spartans&quot;, a parody of the first &quot;300&quot; movie replete with sophomoric humour and deliberate anachronisms. Similarly, a highly satirized depiction of Xerxes based on his portrayal in &quot;300&quot; appears in the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;D-Yikes!&quot;

Other works dealing with the Persian Empire or the Biblical story of Esther have also featured or alluded to Xerxes, such as the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey&quot; and the film &quot;One Night with the King&quot; (2006), in which Ahasuerus (Xerxes) was portrayed by British actor Luke Goss. He is the leader of the Persian Empire in the video game &quot;Civilization II&quot; and &quot;III&quot; (along with Scheherazade), although &quot;Civilization IV&quot; replaces him with Cyrus the Great and Darius I. He reappears as a Leader in &quot;Civilization VII&quot;. In the &quot;Age of Empires&quot;, Xerxes featured as a short swordsman.
Gore Vidal, in his historical fiction novel &quot;Creation&quot; (1981), describes at length the rise of the Achaemenids, especially Darius I, and presents the life and death circumstances of Xerxes. Vidal&#x27;s version of the Persian Wars, which diverges from the orthodoxy of the Greek histories, is told through the invented character of Cyrus Spitama, a half-Greek, half-Persian, and grandson of the prophet Zoroaster. Thanks to his family connection, Cyrus is brought up in the Persian court after the murder of Zoroaster, becoming the boyhood friend of Xerxes, and later a diplomat who is sent to India, and later to Greece, and who is thereby able to gain privileged access to many leading historical figures of the period.

Xerxes (Ahasuerus) is portrayed by Richard Egan in the 1960 film &quot;Esther and the King&quot; and by Joel Smallbone in the 2013 film, &quot;The Book of Esther&quot;. In at least one of these films, the events of the Book of Esther are depicted as taking place upon Xerxes&#x27; return from Greece.

Xerxes plays an important background role (never making an appearance) in two short works of alternate history taking place generations after his complete victory over Greece. These are: &quot;Counting Potsherds&quot; by Harry Turtledove in his anthology &quot;Departures&quot; and &quot;The Craft of War&quot; by Lois Tilton in &quot;Alternate Generals&quot; volume 1 (edited by Turtledove).

<text>Xerxes II (; ; ; died 424 BC) was a Persian king who was very briefly a ruler of the Achaemenid Empire, as the son and successor of Artaxerxes I. 

After a reign of forty-five days—where he only had control over the Persian heartlands—he was assassinated in 424 BC by his half-brother Sogdianus, who in turn was murdered by Darius II six months later. He is an obscure historical figure known primarily from the writings of Ctesias. He was the only legitimate son of Artaxerxes I and Damaspia, and is known to have served as crown prince.

The last inscription mentioning Artaxerxes I being alive can be dated to 424 BC. He succeeded to the throne but two of his illegitimate brothers claimed the throne for themselves. The first was Sogdianus, Artaxerxes I&#x27;s son by his concubine Alogyne of Babylon. The second was Darius II, Artaxerxes I&#x27;s son by his concubine Cosmartidene of Babylon, who was married to their common half-sister Parysatis, daughter of Artaxerxes I and his concubine Andia of Babylon.

Xerxes II was only recognized as king in Persia and Sogdianus in Elam. Ochus&#x27; first inscription as Darius II can be dated to January 10, 423 BC. He was already satrap of Hyrcania and was soon recognized by Media, Babylonia and Egypt. Xerxes II only ruled forty-five days. He was murdered while drunk by Sogdianus, with help from Pharnacyas and Menostanes, who had great influence over him according to Ctesias. Sogdianus gained the support of his regions, but was killed a few months later. Darius II became the sole ruler of the Persian Empire and reigned until 404 BC.

<text>In Greek mythology, Menelaus (; , &#x27;wrath of the people&#x27;, ) was a Greek king of Mycenaean (pre-Dorian) Sparta. According to the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the Trojan war began as a result of Menelaus&#x27;s wife, Helen, fleeing to Troy with the Trojan prince Paris. Menelaus was a central figure in the Trojan War, leading the Spartan contingent of the Greek army, under his elder brother Agamemnon, king of Mycenae. Prominent in both the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Menelaus was also popular in Greek vase painting and Greek tragedy, the latter more as a hero of the Trojan War than as a member of the doomed House of Atreus.

== Description ==
In the account of Dares the Phrygian, Menelaus was described as &quot;of moderate stature, auburn-haired, and handsome. He had a pleasing personality.&quot;

== Family ==
Menelaus was a descendant of Pelops son of Tantalus. He was the younger brother of Agamemnon, and the husband of Helen of Troy. According to the usual version of the story, followed by the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; of Homer, Agamemnon and Menelaus were the sons of Atreus, king of Mycenae, and Aerope, daughter of the Cretan king Catreus. However, according to another tradition, Agamemnon and Menelaus were the sons of Atreus&#x27;s son Pleisthenes, with their mother being Aerope, Cleolla, or Eriphyle. According to this tradition Pleisthenes died young, with Agamemnon and Menelaus being raised by Atreus. Agamemnon and Menelaus had a sister Anaxibia (or Astyoche) who married Strophius, the son of Crisus.

According to the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Menelaus had only one child by Helen, a daughter named Hermione; and an illegitimate son, Megapenthes, by a slave. Other sources mention other sons of Menelaus by either Helen, or slaves. A scholiast on Sophocles&#x27;s &quot;Electra&quot; quotes Hesiod as saying that after Hermione, Helen also bore Menelaus a son Nicostratus, while according to a &quot;Cypria&quot; fragment, Menelaus and Helen had a son Pleisthenes. The mythographer Apollodorus, tells us that Megapenthes&#x27;s mother was a slave &quot;Pieris, an Aetolian, or, according to Acusilaus, ... Tereis&quot;, and that Menelaus had another illegitimate son Xenodamas by another slave girl, Cnossia, while according to the geographer Pausanias, Megapenthes &quot;and&quot; Nicostratus were sons of Menelaus by a slave. The scholiast on &quot;Iliad&quot; 3.175 mentions Nicostratus and Aethiolas as two sons of Helen (by Menelaus?) worshipped by the Lacedaemonians and another son of Helen by Menelaus, Maraphius, from whom descended the Persian Maraphions.

== Mythology ==

===Ascension and reign===
Although early authors, such as Aeschylus, refer in passing to Menelaus&#x27;s early life, detailed sources are quite late, post-dating 5th-century BC Greek tragedy. According to these sources, Menelaus&#x27;s father, Atreus, had been feuding with his brother Thyestes over the throne of Mycenae. After a back-and-forth struggle that featured adultery, incest, and cannibalism, Thyestes gained the throne after his son Aegisthus murdered Atreus. As a result, Atreus&#x27; sons, Menelaus and Agamemnon, went into exile. They first stayed with King Polypheides of Sicyon, and later with King Oeneus of Calydon. But when they thought the time was ripe to dethrone Mycenae&#x27;s hostile ruler, they returned. Assisted by King Tyndareus of Sparta, they drove Thyestes away, and Agamemnon took the throne for himself.

When it was time for Tyndareus&#x27; stepdaughter Helen to marry, many kings and princes came to seek her hand. Among the contenders were Odysseus, Menestheus, Ajax the Great, Patroclus, and Idomeneus. Most offered opulent gifts. Tyndareus would accept none of the gifts, nor would he send any of the suitors away for fear of offending them and giving grounds for a quarrel. Odysseus promised to solve the problem in a satisfactory manner if Tyndareus would support him in his courting of Tyndareus&#x27;s niece Penelope, the daughter of Icarius. Tyndareus readily agreed, and Odysseus proposed that, before the decision was made, all the suitors should swear a most solemn oath to defend the chosen husband in any quarrel. Then it was decreed that straws were to be drawn for Helen&#x27;s hand. The suitor who won was Menelaus (Tyndareus, not to displease the mighty Agamemnon offered him another of his daughters, Clytaemnestra). The rest of the suitors swore their oaths, and Helen and Menelaus were married, Menelaus becoming a ruler of Sparta with Helen after Tyndareus and Leda abdicated the thrones.

Their supposed palace (ἀνάκτορον) has been discovered (the excavations started in 1926 and continued until 1995) in Pellana, Laconia, to the north-west of modern (and classical) Sparta. Other archaeologists consider that Pellana is too far away from other Mycenaean centres to have been the &quot;capital of Menelaus&quot;.

According to tradition Menelaus founded the port-city Menelai Portus on the coast of Marmarica in Northern Africa.

 

===Trojan War===
According to legend, in return for awarding her a golden apple inscribed &quot;to the fairest,&quot; Aphrodite promised Paris the most beautiful woman in all the world. After concluding a diplomatic mission to Sparta during the latter part of which Menelaus was absent to attend the funeral of his maternal grandfather Catreus in Crete, Paris ran off to Troy with Helen despite his brother Hector&#x27;s prohibition. Invoking the oath of Tyndareus, Menelaus and Agamemnon raised a fleet of a thousand ships and went to Troy to secure Helen&#x27;s return; the Trojans refused, providing a &quot;casus belli&quot; for the Trojan War.

Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; is the most comprehensive source for Menelaus&#x27;s exploits during the Trojan War. In Book 3, Menelaus challenges Paris to a duel for Helen&#x27;s return. Menelaus soundly beats Paris, but before he can kill him and claim victory, Aphrodite spirits Paris away inside the walls of Troy. In Book 4, while the Greeks and Trojans squabble over the duel&#x27;s winner, Athena inspires the Trojan Pandarus to shoot Menelaus with his bow and arrow. However, Athena never intended for Menelaus to die and she protects him from the arrow of Pandarus. Menelaus is wounded in the abdomen, and the fighting resumes. Later, in Book 17, Homer gives Menelaus an extended &quot;aristeia&quot; as the hero retrieves the corpse of Patroclus from the battlefield.

According to Hyginus, Menelaus killed eight men in the war, and was one of the Greeks hidden inside the Trojan Horse. During the sack of Troy, Menelaus killed Deiphobus, who had married Helen after the death of Paris.

There are four versions of Menelaus&#x27;s and Helen&#x27;s reunion on the night of the sack of Troy:
*Menelaus sought out Helen in the conquered city. Raging at her infidelity, he raised his sword to kill her, but as he saw her weeping at his feet, begging for her life, Menelaus&#x27;s wrath instantly left him. He took pity on her and decided to take her back as his wife.
*Menelaus resolved to kill Helen, but her irresistible beauty prompted him to drop his sword and take her back to his ship &quot;to punish her at Sparta&quot;, as he claimed.
*According to the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, Menelaus raised his sword in front of the temple in the central square of Troy to kill her, but his wrath went away when he saw her rending her clothes in anguish, revealing her naked breasts.
*A similar version by Stesichorus in &quot;Ilion&#x27;s Conquest&quot; narrated that Menelaus surrendered her to his soldiers to stone her to death, but when she ripped the front of her robes, the Achaean warriors were stunned by her beauty and the stones fell harmlessly from their hands as they stared at her.

===After the war===

Book 4 of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; provides an account of Menelaus&#x27;s return from Troy and his homelife in Sparta. When visited by Odysseus&#x27;s son Telemachus, Menelaus recounts his voyage home. As happened to many Greeks, Menelaus&#x27;s homebound fleet was blown by storms to Crete and Egypt where they were becalmed, unable to sail away. They trapped Proteus and forced him to reveal how to make the voyage home. Once back in Sparta, he and Helen are shown to be reconciled and have a harmonious married life—he holding no grudge at her having run away with a lover and she feeling no restraint in telling anecdotes of her life inside besieged Troy. Menelaus does seem to be pained that he and Helen have no male heir, and is shown to be fond of Megapenthes and Nicostratus, his sons by slave women. According to Euripides&#x27; &quot;Helen&quot;, Menelaus is reunited with Helen after death, on the Isle of the Blessed.

==In vase painting==
Menelaus appears in Greek vase painting in the 6th to 4th centuries BC, such as: Menelaus&#x27;s reception of Paris at Sparta; his retrieval of Patroclus&#x27;s corpse; and his reunion with Helen.

==In Greek tragedy==
Menelaus appears as a character in a number of 5th-century Greek tragedies: Sophocles&#x27;s &quot;Ajax&quot;, and Euripides&#x27;s &quot;Andromache&quot;, &quot;Helen&quot;, &quot;Orestes&quot;, &quot;Iphigenia at Aulis&quot;, and &quot;The Trojan Women&quot;.

<text>Menelaus of [[Alexandria]] (; , &quot;Menelaos ho Alexandreus&quot;; c. 70 – 140 CE) was a Greek mathematician and astronomer, the first to recognize geodesics on a curved surface as natural analogs of straight lines.

==Life and works==

Although very little is known about Menelaus&#x27;s life, it is supposed that he lived in Rome, where he probably moved after having spent his youth in Alexandria. He was called &quot;Menelaus of Alexandria&quot; by both Pappus of Alexandria and Proclus, and a conversation of his with Lucius, held in Rome, is recorded by Plutarch.

Ptolemy (2nd century CE) also mentions, in his work &quot;Almagest&quot; (VII.3), two astronomical observations made by Menelaus in Rome in January of the year 98. These were occultations of the stars Spica and Beta Scorpii by the moon, a few nights apart. Ptolemy used these observations to confirm precession of the equinoxes, a phenomenon that had been discovered by Hipparchus in the 2nd century BCE.

In the 10th-century &quot;Kitāb al-Fihrist&quot; [&quot;The Book Catalogue&quot;] by Ibn al-Nadīm, six books by Menelaus are mentioned: the &quot;Book of Spherical Propositions&quot; (&quot;Sphaerica&quot;), &quot;On the Knowledge of the Weights and Distribution of Different Bodies&quot;, The &quot;Elements of Geometry&quot; in three books, and &quot;The Book on the Triangle&quot;. Only the first of these, &quot;Sphaerica&quot;, survives today in Arabic translation. Composed of three books, it deals with the geometry of the sphere and its application in astronomical measurements and calculations. The book introduces the concept of spherical triangle (figures formed of three great circle arcs, which he named &quot;trilaterals&quot;) and proves Menelaus&#x27; theorem on collinearity of points on the edges of a triangle (which may have been previously known) and its analog for spherical triangles. It was later translated by the sixteenth century astronomer and mathematician Francesco Maurolico.

The lunar crater Menelaus is named after him.

==Bibliography==
The titles of a few books by Menelaus have been preserved:

* &quot;On the calculation of the chords in a circle&quot;, composed of six books
* &quot;Elements of geometry&quot;, composed of three books, later edited by Thabit ibn Qurra
* &quot;On the knowledge of the weights and distributions of different bodies&quot;
* He may also have written a star catalogue.

<text>Lobsters are malacostracans of the family Nephropidae or its synonym Homaridae. They have long bodies with muscular tails and live in crevices or burrows on the sea floor. Three of their five pairs of legs have claws, including the first pair, which are usually much larger than the others. Highly prized as seafood, lobsters are economically important and are often one of the most profitable commodities in the coastal areas they populate.

Commercially important species include two species of &quot;Homarus&quot; from the northern Atlantic Ocean and scampi (which look more like a shrimp, or a &quot;mini lobster&quot;)—the Northern Hemisphere genus &quot;Nephrops&quot; and the Southern Hemisphere genus &quot;Metanephrops&quot;.

== Distinction ==
Although several other groups of crustaceans have the word &quot;lobster&quot; in their names, the unqualified term &quot;lobster&quot; generally refers to the clawed lobsters of the family Nephropidae. Clawed lobsters are not closely related to spiny lobsters or slipper lobsters, which have no claws (chelae), or to squat lobsters. The most similar living relatives of clawed lobsters are the reef lobsters and the three families of freshwater crayfish.

== Description ==
=== Body ===

Lobsters are invertebrates with a hard protective exoskeleton. Like most arthropods, lobsters must shed to grow, which leaves them vulnerable. During the shedding process, several species change color. Lobsters have eight walking legs; the front three pairs bear claws, the first of which are larger than the others. The front pincers are also biologically considered legs, so they belong in the order Decapods (&quot;ten-footed&quot;). Although lobsters are largely bilaterally symmetrical like most other arthropods, some genera possess unequal, specialized claws.

Lobster anatomy includes two main body parts: the cephalothorax and the abdomen. The cephalothorax fuses the head and the thorax, both of which are covered by a chitinous carapace. The lobster&#x27;s head bears antennae, antennules, mandibles, the first and second maxillae. The head also bears the (usually stalked) compound eyes. Because lobsters live in murky environments at the bottom of the ocean, they mostly use their antennae as sensors. The lobster eye has a reflective structure above a convex retina. In contrast, most complex eyes use refractive ray concentrators (lenses) and a concave retina. The lobster&#x27;s thorax is composed of maxillipeds, appendages that function primarily as mouthparts, and pereiopods, appendages that serve for walking and for gathering food. The abdomen includes pleopods (also known as &quot;swimmerets&quot;), used for swimming, as well as the tail fan, composed of uropods and the telson.

Lobsters, like snails and spiders, have blue blood due to the presence of hemocyanin, which contains copper. In contrast, vertebrates, and many other animals have red blood from iron-rich hemoglobin. Lobsters possess a green hepatopancreas, called the tomalley by chefs, which functions as the animal&#x27;s liver and pancreas.

Lobsters of the family Nephropidae are similar in overall form to several other related groups. They differ from freshwater crayfish in lacking the joint between the last two segments of the thorax, and they differ from the reef lobsters of the family Enoplometopidae in having full claws on the first three pairs of legs, rather than just one. The distinctions from fossil families such as the Chilenophoberidae are based on the pattern of grooves on the carapace.

Analysis of the neural gene complement revealed extraordinary development of the chemosensory machinery, including a profound diversification of ligand-gated ion channels and secretory molecules.

=== Coloring ===
Typically, lobsters are dark colored, either bluish-green or greenish-brown, to blend in with the ocean floor, but they can be found in many colors. Lobsters with atypical coloring are extremely rare, accounting for only a few of the millions caught every year, and due to their rarity, they usually are not eaten, instead being released back into the wild or donated to aquariums. Often, in cases of atypical coloring, there is a genetic factor, such as albinism or hermaphroditism. Special coloring does not appear to affect the lobster&#x27;s taste once cooked; except for albinos, all lobsters possess astaxanthin, which is responsible for the bright red color lobsters turn after being cooked.
== Longevity ==
Lobsters live up to an estimated 45 to 50 years in the wild, although determining age is difficult: it is typically estimated from size and other variables. Newer techniques may lead to more accurate age estimates.

Research suggests that lobsters may not slow down, weaken, or lose fertility with age and that older lobsters may be more fertile than younger lobsters. This longevity may be due to telomerase, an enzyme that repairs long repetitive sections of DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes, referred to as telomeres. Telomerase is expressed by most vertebrates during embryonic stages but is generally absent from adult stages of life. However, unlike most vertebrates, lobsters express telomerase as adults through most tissue, which has been suggested to be related to their longevity. Telomerase is especially present in green spotted lobsters, whose markings are thought to be produced by the enzyme interacting with their shell pigmentation. Lobster longevity is limited by their size. Moulting requires metabolic energy, and the larger the lobster, the more energy is needed; 10 to 15% of lobsters die of exhaustion during moulting, while in older lobsters, moulting ceases and the exoskeleton degrades or collapses entirely, leading to death.

Like many decapod crustaceans, lobsters grow throughout life and can add new muscle cells at each moult. Lobster longevity allows them to reach impressive sizes. According to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, the largest lobster ever caught was in Nova Scotia, Canada, weighing .

== Ecology ==
Lobsters live in all oceans, on rocky, sandy, or muddy bottoms from the shoreline to beyond the edge of the continental shelf, contingent largely on size and age. Smaller, younger lobsters are typically found in crevices or in burrows under rocks and do not typically migrate. Larger, older lobsters are more likely to be found in deeper seas, migrating back to shallow waters seasonally.

Lobsters are omnivores and typically eat live prey such as fish, mollusks, other crustaceans, worms, and some plant life. They scavenge if necessary and are known to resort to cannibalism in captivity. However, when lobster skin is found in lobster stomachs, this is not necessarily evidence of cannibalism because lobsters eat their shed skin after moulting. While cannibalism was thought to be nonexistent among wild lobster populations, it was observed in 2012 by researchers studying wild lobsters in Maine. These first known instances of lobster cannibalism in the wild are theorized to be attributed to a local population explosion among lobsters caused by the disappearance of many of the Maine lobsters&#x27; natural predators.

In general, lobsters are long and move by slowly walking on the sea floor. However, they swim backward quickly when they flee by curling and uncurling their abdomens. A speed of has been recorded. This is known as the caridoid escape reaction.

Symbiotic animals of the genus &quot;Symbion&quot;, the only known member of the phylum Cycliophora, live exclusively on lobster gills and mouthparts. Different species of &quot;Symbion&quot; have been found on the three commercially important lobsters of the North Atlantic Ocean: &quot;Nephrops norvegicus&quot;, &quot;Homarus gammarus&quot;, and &quot;Homarus americanus&quot;.

== As food ==

Lobster is commonly served boiled or steamed in the shell. Diners crack the shell with lobster crackers and fish out the meat with lobster picks. The meat is often eaten with melted butter and lemon juice. Lobster is also used in soup, bisque, lobster rolls, &quot;cappon magro&quot;, and dishes such as lobster Newberg and lobster Thermidor.

Cooks boil or steam live lobsters. When a lobster is cooked, its shell&#x27;s color changes from brown to orange because the heat from cooking breaks down a protein called crustacyanin, which suppresses the orange hue of the chemical astaxanthin, which is also found in the shell.

According to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the mean level of mercury in American lobster between 2005 and 2007 was 0.107ppm.

=== History ===


Humans are claimed to have eaten lobster since early history. Large piles of lobster shells near areas populated by fishing communities attest to the crustacean&#x27;s extreme popularity during this period. Evidence indicates that lobster was being consumed as a regular food product in fishing communities along the shores of Britain, South Africa, Australia, and Papua New Guinea years ago. Lobster became a significant source of nutrients among European coastal dwellers. Historians suggest lobster was an important secondary food source for most European coastal dwellers, and it was a primary food source for coastal communities in Britain during this time.

Lobster became a popular mid-range delicacy during the mid to late Roman period. The price of lobster could vary widely due to various factors, but evidence indicates that lobster was regularly transported inland over long distances to meet popular demand. A mosaic found in the ruins of Pompeii suggests that the spiny lobster was of considerable interest to the Roman population during the early imperial period.

Lobster was a popular food among the Moche people of Peru between 50 CE and 800 CE. Besides its use as food, lobster shells were also used to create a light pink dye, ornaments, and tools. A mass-produced lobster-shaped effigy vessel dated to this period attests to lobster&#x27;s popularity at this time, though the purpose of this vessel has not been identified.

The Viking period saw an increase in lobster and other shellfish consumption among northern Europeans. This can be attributed to the overall increase in marine activity due to the development of better boats and the increasing cultural investment in building ships and training sailors. The consumption of marine life went up overall in this period, and the consumption of lobster went up in accordance with this general trend.

Unlike fish, however, lobster had to be cooked within two days of leaving salt water, limiting the availability of lobster for inland dwellers. Thus lobster, more than fish, became a food primarily available to the relatively well-off, at least among non-coastal dwellers.
Lobster is first mentioned in cookbooks during the medieval period. &quot;Le Viandier de Taillevent,&quot; a French recipe collection written around 1300, suggests that lobster (also called saltwater crayfish) be &quot;Cooked in wine and water, or in the oven; eaten in vinegar.&quot; &quot;Le Viandier de Taillevent&quot; is considered to be one of the first &quot;haute cuisine&quot; cookbooks, advising on how to cook meals that would have been quite elaborate for the period and making usage of expensive and hard to obtain ingredients. Though the original edition, which includes the recipe for lobster, was published before the birth of French court cook Guillaume Tirel, Tirel later expanded and republished this recipe collection, suggesting that the recipes included in both editions were popular among the highest circles of French nobility, including King Philip VI. The inclusion of a lobster recipe in this cookbook, especially one which does not make use of other more expensive ingredients, attests to the popularity of lobster among the wealthy.

The French household guidebook &quot;Le Ménagier de Paris&quot;, published in 1393, includes no less than five recipes including lobster, which vary in elaboration. A guidebook intended to provide advice for women running upper-class households, &quot;Le Ménagier de Paris&quot; is similar to its predecessor in that it indicates the popularity of lobster as a food among the upper classes.

That lobster was first mentioned in cookbooks during the 1300s and only mentioned in two during this century should not be taken as an implication that lobster was not widely consumed before or during this time. Recipe collections were virtually non-existent before the 1300s, and only a handful exist from the medieval period.

During the early 1400s, lobster was still a popular dish among the upper classes. During this time, influential households used the variety and variation of species served at feasts to display wealth and prestige. Lobster was commonly found among these spreads, indicating that it continued to be held in high esteem among the wealthy. In one notable instance, the Bishop of Salisbury offered at least 42 kinds of crustaceans and fish at his feasts over nine months, including several varieties of lobster. However, lobster was not a food exclusively accessed by the wealthy. The general population living on the coasts made use of the various food sources provided by the ocean, and shellfish especially became a more popular source of nutrition. Among the general population, lobster was generally eaten boiled during the mid-15th century, but the influence of the cuisine of higher society can be seen in that it was now also regularly eaten cold with vinegar. The inland peasantry would still have generally been unfamiliar with lobster during this time.

Lobster continued to be eaten as a delicacy and a general staple food among coastal communities until the late 17th century. During this time, the influence of the Church and the government regulating and sometimes banning meat consumption during certain periods continued to encourage the popularity of seafood, especially shellfish, as a meat alternative among all classes. Throughout this period, lobster was eaten fresh, pickled, and salted. From the late 17th century onward, developments in fishing, transportation, and cooking technology allowed lobster to more easily make its way inland, and the variety of dishes involving lobster and cooking techniques used with the ingredient expanded. However, these developments coincided with a decrease in the lobster population, and lobster increasingly became a delicacy food, valued among the rich as a status symbol and less likely to be found in the diet of the general population.

The American lobster was not originally popular among European colonists in North America. This was partially due to the European inlander&#x27;s association of lobster with barely edible salted seafood and partially due to a cultural opinion that seafood was a lesser alternative to meat that did not provide the taste or nutrients desired. It was also due to the extreme abundance of lobster at the time of the colonists&#x27; arrival, which contributed to a general perception of lobster as an undesirable peasant food. The American lobster did not achieve popularity until the mid-19th century when New Yorkers and Bostonians developed a taste for it, and commercial lobster fisheries only flourished after the development of the lobster smack, a custom-made boat with open holding wells on the deck to keep the lobsters alive during transport.

Before this time, lobster was considered a poverty food or as a food for indentured servants or lower members of society in Maine, Massachusetts, and the Canadian Maritimes. Some servants specified in employment agreements that they would not eat lobster more than twice per week, however there is limited evidence for this. Lobster was also commonly served in prisons, much to the displeasure of inmates. American lobster was initially deemed worthy only of being used as fertilizer or fish bait, and until well into the 20th century, it was not viewed as more than a low-priced canned staple food.

As a crustacean, lobster remains a taboo food in the dietary laws of Judaism and certain streams of Islam.

=== Grading ===

Caught lobsters are graded as new-shell, hard-shell, or old-shell. Because lobsters that have recently shed their shells are the most delicate, an inverse relationship exists between the price of American lobster and its flavor. New-shell lobsters have paper-thin shells and a worse meat-to-shell ratio, but the meat is very sweet. However, the lobsters are so delicate that even transport to Boston almost kills them, making the market for new-shell lobsters strictly local to the fishing towns where they are offloaded. Hard-shell lobsters with firm shells but less sweet meat can survive shipping to Boston, New York, and even Los Angeles, so they command a higher price than new-shell lobsters. Meanwhile, old-shell lobsters, which have not shed since the previous season and have a coarser flavor, can be air-shipped anywhere in the world and arrive alive, making them the most expensive.

=== Killing methods and animal welfare ===
Several methods are used for killing lobsters. The most common way of killing lobsters is by placing them live in boiling water, sometimes after being placed in a freezer for a period. Boiling lobsters has been banned in several jurisdictions, including Switzerland, New Zealand, and parts of Italy. In Italy, offenders face fines of up to €495. Boiling has been deemed to cause extreme suffering in lobsters, who continue to show intense brain activity for 30 to 150 seconds after immersion in boiling water. Slowly raising the water temperature may also cause pain in crustaceans over a longer period of time.

Another method is to split the lobster or sever the body in half lengthwise. To effectively kill the lobster quickly, the whole lobster must be split in two (not just its head, as is the practice in some restaurants). Lobsters may also be killed or immobilized immediately before boiling by a stab into the brain (pithing), in the belief that this will stop suffering. However, a lobster&#x27;s brain operates from not one but several ganglia, and disabling only the frontal ganglion does not usually result in death. Lobsters can be killed by electrocution prior to cooking with a device called the CrustaStun. Another method of rendering a lobster unconscious, chilling, has not been found to be effective.

Since March 2018, lobsters in Switzerland need to be knocked out, or killed instantly, before they are boiled. They also receive other forms of protection while in transit.

=== Recognition of the sentience of European lobsters ===
A 2021 London School of Economics report found strong evidence to suggest that lobsters can experience pain. Dr Jonathan Birch, Principal Investigator on the project, said, &quot;After reviewing over 300 scientific studies, we concluded that cephalopod molluscs and decapod crustaceans should be regarded as sentient, and should therefore be included within the scope of animal welfare law.”

Following the publication of the report, octopuses, crabs and lobsters are now protected under stronger animal welfare legislation in the UK (under the Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill).

== Fishery and aquaculture ==

Lobsters are caught using baited one-way traps with a color-coded marker buoy to mark cages. Lobster is fished in water between , although some lobsters live at . Cages are of plastic-coated galvanized steel or wood. A lobster fisher may tend to as many as 2,000 traps.

Around the year 2000, owing to overfishing and high demand, lobster aquaculture expanded.

<text>Flounders are a group of flatfish species. They are demersal fish, found at the bottom of oceans around the world; some species will also enter estuaries.

== Taxonomy ==
The name &quot;flounder&quot; is used for several only distantly related species, though all are in the suborder Pleuronectoidei (families Achiropsettidae, Bothidae, Pleuronectidae, Paralichthyidae, and Samaridae). Some of the better known species that are important in fisheries are:
* Western Atlantic
** Gulf flounder – &quot;Paralichthys albigutta&quot;
** Southern flounder – &quot;Paralichthys lethostigma&quot;
** Summer flounder (also known as &quot;fluke&quot;) – &quot;Paralichthys dentatus&quot;
** Winter flounder – &quot;Pseudopleuronectes americanus&quot;
* European waters
**European flounder – &quot;Platichthys flesus&quot;
**Witch flounder – &quot;Glyptocephalus cynoglossus&quot;
* North Pacific
** Halibut – &quot;Hippoglossus stenolepis&quot;
** Olive flounder – &quot;Paralichthys olivaceus&quot;

== Eye migration ==

Larval flounder are born with one eye on each side of their head, but as they grow from the larval to juvenile stage through metamorphosis, one eye migrates to the other side of the body. As a result, both eyes are then on the side which faces up. The side to which the eyes migrate is dependent on the species type. As an adult, a flounder changes its habits and camouflages itself by lying on the bottom of the ocean floor as protection against predators.

== Habitat ==
Flounders ambush their prey, feeding at soft muddy areas of the sea bottom, near bridge piles, docks, and coral reefs.

A flounder&#x27;s diet consists mainly of fish spawn, crustaceans, polychaetes and small fish. Flounder typically grow to a length of , and as large as . Their width is about half their length. Male &quot;Platichthys&quot; have been found up to off the coast of northern Sardinia, sometimes with heavy encrustations of various species of barnacle.

Fluke, a type of flounder, are being farm raised in open water by Mariculture Technologies in Greenport, New York.

== Threats ==

World stocks of large predatory fish and large ground fish, including sole and flounder, were estimated in 2003 to be only about 10% of pre-industrial levels, largely due to overfishing. Most overfishing is due to the extensive activities of the fishing industry. Current estimates suggest that approximately 30 million flounder (excluding sole) are alive in the world today. In the Gulf of Mexico, along the coast of Texas, research indicates the flounder population could be as low as 15 million due to heavy overfishing and industrial pollution.

<text>Globalization is the process of increasing interdependence and integration among the economies, markets, societies, and cultures of different countries worldwide. This is made possible by the reduction of barriers to international trade, the liberalization of capital movements, the development of transportation, and the advancement of information and communication technologies. The term &quot;globalization&quot; first appeared in the early 20th century (supplanting an earlier French term &quot;mondialisation&quot;), developed its current meaning sometime in the second half of the 20th century, and came into popular use in the 1990s to describe the unprecedented international connectivity of the post–Cold War world. The origins of globalization can be traced back to the 18th and 19th centuries, driven by advances in transportation and communication technologies. These developments increased global interactions, fostering the growth of international trade and the exchange of ideas, beliefs, and cultures. While globalization is primarily an economic process of interaction and integration, it is also closely linked to social and cultural dynamics. Additionally, disputes and international diplomacy have played significant roles in the history and evolution of globalization, continuing to shape its modern form.

Economically, globalization involves goods, services, data, technology, and the economic resources of capital. The expansion of global markets liberalizes the economic activities of the exchange of goods and funds. Removal of cross-border trade barriers has made the formation of global markets more feasible. Advances in transportation, like the steam locomotive, steamship, jet engine, and container ships, and developments in telecommunication infrastructure such as the telegraph, the Internet, mobile phones, and smartphones, have been major factors in globalization and have generated further interdependence of economic and cultural activities around the globe.

Though many scholars place the origins of globalization in modern times, others trace its history to long before the European Age of Discovery and voyages to the New World, and some even to the third millennium BCE. Large-scale globalization began in the 1820s, and in the late 19th century and early 20th century drove a rapid expansion in the connectivity of the world&#x27;s economies and cultures. The term &quot;global city&quot; was subsequently popularized by sociologist Saskia Sassen in her work &quot;The Global City: New York, London, Tokyo&quot; (1991).

In 2000, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified four basic aspects of globalization: trade and transactions, capital and investment movements, migration and movement of people, and the dissemination of knowledge. Globalizing processes affect and are affected by business and work organization, economics, sociocultural resources, and the natural environment. Academic literature commonly divides globalization into three major areas: economic globalization, cultural globalization, and political globalization.

Proponents of globalization point to economic growth and broader societal development as benefits, while opponents claim globalizing processes are detrimental to social well-being due to ethnocentrism, environmental consequences, and other potential drawbacks.

Between 1990 and 2010, globalization progressed rapidly, driven by the information and communication technology revolution that lowered communication costs, along with trade liberalization and the shift of manufacturing operations to emerging economies (particularly China). 
==Etymology and usage==
The word globalization was used in the English language as early as the 1930s, but only in the context of education, and the term failed to gain traction. Over the next few decades, the term was occasionally used by other scholars and media, but it was not clearly defined. One of the first usages of the term in the meaning resembling the later, was by French economist François Perroux in his essays from the early 1960s (in his French works he used the term &quot;mondialisation&quot; (literarly worldization in French), also translated as mundialization). Theodore Levitt is often credited with popularizing the term and bringing it into the mainstream business audience in the later in the middle of 1980s.

Though often treated as synonyms, in French, globalization is seen as a stage following mondialisation, a stage that implies the dissolution of national identities and the abolishment of borders inside the world network of economic exchanges.

Since its inception, the concept of globalization has inspired competing definitions and interpretations. Its antecedents date back to the great movements of trade and empire across Asia and the Indian Ocean from the 15th century onward.

In 1848, Karl Marx noticed the increasing level of national inter-dependence brought on by capitalism, and predicted the universal character of the modern world society. He states:
Sociologists Martin Albrow and Elizabeth King define globalization as &quot;all those processes by which the people of the world are incorporated into a single world society.&quot; In &quot;The Consequences of Modernity&quot;, Anthony Giddens writes: &quot;Globalization can thus be defined as the intensification of worldwide social relations which link distant localities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and vice versa.&quot; In 1992, Roland Robertson, professor of sociology at the University of Aberdeen and an early writer in the field, described globalization as &quot;the compression of the world and the intensification of the consciousness of the world as a whole.&quot;

In &quot;Global Transformations&quot;, David Held and his co-writers state:
Held and his co-writers&#x27; definition of globalization in that same book as &quot;transformation in the spatial organization of social relations and transactions—assessed in terms of their extensity, intensity, velocity and impact—generating transcontinental or inter-regional flows&quot; was called &quot;probably the most widely-cited definition&quot; in the 2014 DHL Global Connectiveness Index.

Swedish journalist Thomas Larsson, in his book &quot;The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization&quot;, states that globalization:

Paul James defines globalization with a more direct and historically contextualized emphasis:

Globalization is the extension of social relations across world-space, defining that world-space in terms of the historically variable ways that it has been practiced and socially understood through changing world-time.

Manfred Steger, professor of global studies and research leader in the Global Cities Institute at RMIT University, identifies four main empirical dimensions of globalization: economic, political, cultural, and ecological. A fifth dimension—the ideological—cutting across the other four. The ideological dimension, according to Steger, is filled with a range of norms, claims, beliefs, and narratives about the phenomenon itself.

James and Steger stated that the concept of globalization &quot;emerged from the intersection of four interrelated sets of &#x27;communities of practice&#x27; (Wenger, 1998): academics, journalists, publishers/editors, and librarians.&quot; They note the term was used &quot;in education to describe the global life of the mind&quot;; in international relations to describe the extension of the European Common Market, and in journalism to describe how the &quot;American Negro and his problem are taking on a global significance&quot;. They have also argued that four forms of globalization can be distinguished that complement and cut across the solely empirical dimensions. According to James, the oldest dominant form of globalization is embodied globalization, the movement of people. A second form is agency-extended globalization, the circulation of agents of different institutions, organizations, and polities, including imperial agents. Object-extended globalization, a third form, is the movement of commodities and other objects of exchange. He calls the transmission of ideas, images, knowledge, and information across world-space disembodied globalization, maintaining that it is currently the dominant form of globalization. James holds that this series of distinctions allows for an understanding of how, today, the most embodied forms of globalization such as the movement of refugees and migrants are increasingly restricted, while the most disembodied forms such as the circulation of financial instruments and codes are the most deregulated.

The journalist Thomas L. Friedman popularized the term &quot;flat world&quot;, arguing that globalized trade, outsourcing, supply-chaining, and political forces had permanently changed the world, for better and worse. He asserted that the pace of globalization was quickening and that its impact on business organization and practice would continue to grow.

Economist Takis Fotopoulos defined &quot;economic globalization&quot; as the opening and deregulation of commodity, capital, and labor markets that led toward present neoliberal globalization. He used &quot;political globalization&quot; to refer to the emergence of a transnational élite and a phasing out of the nation-state. Meanwhile, he used &quot;cultural globalization&quot; to reference the worldwide homogenization of culture. Other of his usages included &quot;ideological globalization&quot;, &quot;technological globalization&quot;, and &quot;social globalization&quot;.

Lechner and Boli (2012) define globalization as more people across large distances becoming connected in more and different ways.

&quot;Globophobia&quot; is used to refer to the fear of globalization, though it can also mean the fear of balloons.

==History==

There are both distal and proximate causes which can be traced in the historical factors affecting globalization. Large-scale globalization began in the 19th century.

===Archaic===

Archaic globalization conventionally refers to a phase in the history of globalization including globalizing events and developments from the time of the earliest civilizations until roughly the 1600s. This term is used to describe the relationships between communities and states and how they were created by the geographical spread of ideas and social norms at both local and regional levels.

In this schema, three main prerequisites are posited for globalization to occur. The first is the idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how Western states have adapted and implemented learned principles from the East. Without the spread of traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did. The interactions of states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, North Africa, the Middle East, and certain parts of Europe. With early globalization, it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not close. Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others&#x27; existence and thus another phase of globalization can occur. The third has to do with inter-dependency, stability, and regularity. If a state is not dependent on another, then there is no way for either state to be mutually affected by the other. This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either, globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own production and resources to work. This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization. It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today.

Also posited is a &quot;multi-polar&quot; nature to archaic globalization, which involved the active participation of non-Europeans. Because it predated the Great Divergence in the nineteenth century, where Western Europe pulled ahead of the rest of the world in terms of industrial production and economic output, archaic globalization was a phenomenon that was driven not only by Europe but also by other economically developed Old World centers such as Gujarat, Bengal, coastal China, and Japan.
The German historical economist and sociologist Andre Gunder Frank argues that a form of globalization began with the rise of trade links between Sumer and the Indus Valley civilization in the third millennium BCE. This archaic globalization existed during the Hellenistic Age, when commercialized urban centers enveloped the axis of Greek culture that reached from India to Spain, including Alexandria and the other Alexandrine cities. Early on, the geographic position of Greece and the necessity of importing wheat forced the Greeks to engage in maritime trade. Trade in ancient Greece was largely unrestricted: the state controlled only the supply of grain.

Trade on the Silk Road was a significant factor in the development of civilizations from China, the Indian subcontinent, Persia, Europe, and Arabia, opening long-distance political and economic interactions between them. Though silk was certainly the major trade item from China, common goods such as salt and sugar were traded as well; and religions, syncretic philosophies, and various technologies, as well as diseases, also traveled along the Silk Routes. In addition to economic trade, the Silk Road served as a means of carrying out cultural trade among the civilizations along its network. The movement of people, such as refugees, artists, craftsmen, missionaries, robbers, and envoys, resulted in the exchange of religions, art, languages, and new technologies. From around 3000 BCE to 1000 CE, connectivity within Afro-Eurasia was centered upon the Indo-Mediterranean region, with the Silk Road later rising in importance with the Mongol Empire&#x27;s consolidation of Asia in the 13th century.

===Early modern===
&quot;Early modern&quot; or &quot;proto-globalization&quot; covers a period of the history of globalization roughly spanning the years between 1600 and 1800. The concept of &quot;proto-globalization&quot; was first introduced by historians A. G. Hopkins and Christopher Bayly. The term describes the phase of increasing trade links and cultural exchange that characterized the period immediately preceding the advent of high &quot;modern globalization&quot; in the late 19th century. This phase of globalization was characterized by the rise of maritime European empires, in the 15th and 17th centuries, first the Portuguese Empire (1415) followed by the Spanish Empire (1492), and later the Dutch and British Empires. In the 17th century, world trade developed further when chartered companies like the British East India Company (founded in 1600) and the Dutch East India Company (founded in 1602, often described as the first multinational corporation in which stock was offered) were established.
An alternative view from historians Dennis Flynn and Arturo Giraldez, postulated that: globalization began with the first circumnavigation of the globe under the Magellan-Elcano expedition which preluded the rise of global silver trade.

Early modern globalization is distinguished from modern globalization on the basis of expansionism, the method of managing global trade, and the level of information exchange. The period is marked by the shift of hegemony to Western Europe, the rise of larger-scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the Thirty Years&#x27; War, and demand for commodities, most particularly slaves. The triangular trade made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the Western Hemisphere. The transfer of animal stocks, plant crops, and epidemic diseases associated with Alfred W. Crosby&#x27;s concept of the Columbian exchange also played a central role in this process. European, Middle Eastern, Indian, Southeast Asian, and Chinese merchants were all involved in early modern trade and communications, particularly in the Indian Ocean region.


===Modern===
According to economic historians Kevin H. O&#x27;Rourke, Leandro Prados de la Escosura, and Guillaume Daudin, several factors promoted globalization in the period 1815–1870:

* The conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars brought in an era of relative peace in Europe.
* Innovations in transportation technology reduced trade costs substantially.
* New industrial military technologies increased the power of European states and the United States, and allowed these powers to forcibly open up markets across the world and extend their empires.
* A gradual move towards greater liberalization in European countries.

During the 19th century, globalization approached its form as a direct result of the Industrial Revolution. Industrialization allowed standardized production of household items using economies of scale while rapid population growth created sustained demand for commodities. In the 19th century, steamships reduced the cost of international transportation significantly and railroads made inland transportation cheaper. The transportation revolution occurred some time between 1820 and 1850. More nations embraced international trade. Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenth-century imperialism such as in Africa and Asia.

=== Contemporary ===
After World War II, work by politicians led to the agreements of the Bretton Woods Conference, in which major governments laid down the framework for international monetary policy, commerce, and finance, and the founding of several international institutions intended to facilitate economic growth by lowering trade barriers. Initially, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) led to a series of agreements to remove trade restrictions. GATT&#x27;s successor was the World Trade Organization (WTO), which provided a framework for negotiating and formalizing trade agreements and a dispute resolution process. Exports nearly doubled from 8.5% of total gross world product in 1970 to 16.2% in 2001. The approach of using global agreements to advance trade stumbled with the failure of the Doha Development Round of trade negotiation. Many countries then shifted to bilateral or smaller multilateral agreements, such as the 2011 United States–Korea Free Trade Agreement.

The invention of shipping containers in 1956 helped advance the globalization of commerce. Since the 1970s, aviation has become increasingly affordable to middle classes in developed countries. Open skies policies and low-cost carriers have helped to bring competition to the market. In the 1990s, the growth of low-cost communication networks cut the cost of communicating between countries. More work can be performed using a computer without regard to location. This included accounting, software development, and engineering design.

Student exchange programs became popular after World War II, and are intended to increase the participants&#x27; understanding and tolerance of other cultures, as well as improving their language skills and broadening their social horizons. Between 1963 and 2006 the number of students studying in a foreign country increased 9 times.
Since the 1980s, modern globalization has spread rapidly through the expansion of capitalism and neoliberal ideologies. The implementation of neoliberal policies has allowed for the privatization of public industry, deregulation of laws or policies that interfered with the free flow of the market, as well as cut-backs to governmental social services. These neoliberal policies were introduced to many developing countries in the form of structural adjustment programs (SAPs) that were implemented by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). These programs required that the country receiving monetary aid would open its markets to capitalism, privatize public industry, allow free trade, cut social services like healthcare and education and allow the free movement of giant multinational corporations. These programs allowed the World Bank and the IMF to become global financial market regulators that would promote neoliberalism and the creation of free markets for multinational corporations on a global scale.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, the connectedness of the world&#x27;s economies and cultures grew very quickly. This slowed down from the 1910s onward due to the World Wars and the Cold War, but picked up again in the 1980s and 1990s. The revolutions of 1989 and subsequent liberalization in many parts of the world resulted in a significant expansion of global interconnectedness. The migration and movement of people can also be highlighted as a prominent feature of the globalization process. In the period between 1965 and 1990, the proportion of the labor force migrating approximately doubled. Most migration occurred between the developing countries and least developed countries (LDCs). As economic integration intensified workers moved to areas with higher wages and most of the developing world oriented toward the international market economy. The collapse of the Soviet Union not only ended the Cold War&#x27;s division of the world – it also left the United States its sole policeman and an unfettered advocate of free market. It also resulted in the growing prominence of attention focused on the movement of diseases, the proliferation of popular culture and consumer values, the growing prominence of international institutions like the UN, and concerted international action on such issues as the environment and human rights. Other developments as dramatic were the Internet&#x27;s becoming influential in connecting people across the world; , more than 2.4 billion people—over a third of the world&#x27;s human population—have used the services of the Internet. Growth of globalization has never been smooth. One influential event was the late 2000s recession, which was associated with lower growth (in areas such as cross-border phone calls and Skype usage) or even temporarily negative growth (in areas such as trade) of global interconnectedness.

The China–United States trade war, starting in 2018, negatively affected trade between the two largest national economies. The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic included a massive decline in tourism and international business travel as many countries temporarily closed borders. The 2021–2022 global supply chain crisis resulted from temporary shutdowns of manufacturing and transportation facilities, and labor shortages. Supply problems incentivized some switches to domestic production. The economic impact of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine included a blockade of Ukrainian ports and international sanctions on Russia, resulting in some de-coupling of the Russian economy with global trade, especially with the European Union and other Western countries.

Modern consensus for the last 15 years regards globalization as having run its course and gone into decline. A common argument for this is that trade has dropped since its peak in 2008, and never recovered since the Great Recession. New opposing views from some economists have argued such trends are a result of price drops and in actuality, trade volume is increasing, especially with agricultural products, natural resources and refined petroleum. The 21st century melting of the Arctic will also affect global trade, as it is paving the way for shorter trade routes.

==Economic globalization==

Economic globalization is the increasing economic interdependence of national economies across the world through a rapid increase in cross-border movement of goods, services, technology, and capital. Whereas the globalization of business is centered around the diminution of international trade regulations as well as tariffs, taxes, and other impediments that suppresses global trade, economic globalization is the process of increasing economic integration between countries, leading to the emergence of a global marketplace or a single world market. Depending on the paradigm, economic globalization can be viewed as either a positive or a negative phenomenon. Economic globalization comprises: globalization of production; which refers to the obtainment of goods and services from a particular source from locations around the globe to benefit from difference in cost and quality. Likewise, it also comprises globalization of markets; which is defined as the union of different and separate markets into a massive global marketplace. Economic globalization also includes competition, technology, and corporations and industries.

Current globalization trends can be largely accounted for by developed economies integrating with less developed economies by means of foreign direct investment, the reduction of trade barriers as well as other economic reforms, and, in many cases, immigration.

International standards have made trade in goods and services more efficient. An example of such standard is the intermodal container. Containerization dramatically reduced the costs of transportation, supported the post-war boom in international trade, and was a major element in globalization. International standards are set by the International Organization for Standardization, which is composed of representatives from various national standards organizations.

A multinational corporation, or worldwide enterprise, is an organization that owns or controls the production of goods or services in one or more countries other than their home country. It can also be referred to as an international corporation, a transnational corporation, or a stateless corporation.

A free-trade area is the region encompassing a trade bloc whose member countries have signed a free-trade agreement (FTA). Such agreements involve cooperation between at least two countries to reduce trade barriers import quotas and tariffs and to increase trade of goods and services with each other.

If people are also free to move between the countries, in addition to a free-trade agreement, it would also be considered an open border. Arguably, the most significant free-trade area in the world is the European Union, a politico-economic union of member states that are primarily located in Europe. The EU has developed European Single Market through a standardized system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market,

Trade facilitation looks at how procedures and controls governing the movement of goods across national borders can be improved to reduce associated cost burdens and maximize efficiency while safeguarding legitimate regulatory objectives.

Global trade in services is also significant. For example, in India, business process outsourcing has been described as the &quot;primary engine of the country&#x27;s development over the next few decades, contributing broadly to GDP growth, employment growth, and poverty alleviation&quot;.

William I. Robinson&#x27;s theoretical approach to globalization is a critique of Wallerstein&#x27;s World Systems Theory. He believes that the global capital experienced today is due to a new and distinct form of globalization which began in the 1980s. Robinson argues not only are economic activities expanded across national boundaries but also there is a transnational fragmentation of these activities. One important aspect of Robinson&#x27;s globalization theory is that production of goods are increasingly global. This means that one pair of shoes can be produced by six countries, each contributing to a part of the production process.
==Cultural globalization==

Cultural globalization refers to the transmission of ideas, meanings, and values around the world in such a way as to extend and intensify social relations. This process is marked by the common consumption of cultures that have been diffused by the Internet, popular culture media, and international travel. This has added to processes of commodity exchange and colonization which have a longer history of carrying cultural meaning around the globe. The circulation of cultures enables individuals to partake in extended social relations that cross national and regional borders. The creation and expansion of such social relations is not merely observed on a material level. Cultural globalization involves the formation of shared norms and knowledge with which people associate their individual and collective cultural identities. It brings increasing interconnectedness among different populations and cultures.

Cross-cultural communication is a field of study that looks at how people from differing cultural backgrounds communicate, in similar and different ways among themselves, and how they endeavor to communicate across cultures. Intercultural communication is a related field of study.

Cultural diffusion is the spread of cultural items—such as ideas, styles, religions, technologies, languages etc.
Cultural globalization has increased cross-cultural contacts, but may be accompanied by a decrease in the uniqueness of once-isolated communities. For example, sushi is available in Germany as well as Japan, but Euro-Disney outdraws the city of Paris, potentially reducing demand for &quot;authentic&quot; French pastry. Globalization&#x27;s contribution to the alienation of individuals from their traditions may be modest compared to the impact of modernity itself, as alleged by existentialists such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. Globalization has expanded recreational opportunities by spreading pop culture, particularly via the Internet and satellite television. The cultural diffusion can create a homogenizing force, where globalization is seen as synonymous with homogenizing force via connectedness of markets, cultures, politics and the desire for modernizations through imperial countries sphere of influence.

Religions were among the earliest cultural elements to globalize, being spread by force, migration, evangelists, imperialists, and traders. Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and more recently sects such as Mormonism are among those religions which have taken root and influenced endemic cultures in places far from their origins.
Globalization has strongly influenced sports. For example, the modern Olympic Games has athletes from more than 200 nations participating in a variety of competitions. The FIFA World Cup is the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the Olympic Games; a ninth of the entire population of the planet watched the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final.

The term globalization implies transformation. Cultural practices including traditional music can be lost or turned into a fusion of traditions. Globalization can trigger a state of emergency for the preservation of musical heritage. Archivists may attempt to collect, record, or transcribe repertoires before melodies are assimilated or modified, while local musicians may struggle for authenticity and to preserve local musical traditions. Globalization can lead performers to discard traditional instruments. Fusion genres can become interesting fields of analysis.

Music has an important role in economic and cultural development during globalization. Music genres such as jazz and reggae began locally and later became international phenomena. Globalization gave support to the world music phenomenon by allowing music from developing countries to reach broader audiences. Though the term &quot;World Music&quot; was originally intended for ethnic-specific music, globalization is now expanding its scope such that the term often includes hybrid subgenres such as &quot;world fusion&quot;, &quot;global fusion&quot;, &quot;ethnic fusion&quot;, and worldbeat.
Bourdieu claimed that the perception of consumption can be seen as self-identification and the formation of identity. Musically, this translates into each individual having their own musical identity based on likes and tastes. These likes and tastes are greatly influenced by culture, as this is the most basic cause for a person&#x27;s wants and behavior. The concept of one&#x27;s own culture is now in a period of change due to globalization. Also, globalization has increased the interdependency of political, personal, cultural, and economic factors.

A 2005 UNESCO report showed that cultural exchange is becoming more frequent from Eastern Asia, but that Western countries are still the main exporters of cultural goods. In 2002, China was the third largest exporter of cultural goods, after the UK and US. Between 1994 and 2002, both North America&#x27;s and the European Union&#x27;s shares of cultural exports declined while Asia&#x27;s cultural exports grew to surpass North America. Related factors are the fact that Asia&#x27;s population and area are several times that of North America. Americanization is related to a period of high political American clout and of significant growth of America&#x27;s shops, markets and objects being brought into other countries.

Some critics of globalization argue that it harms the diversity of cultures. As a dominating country&#x27;s culture is introduced into a receiving country through globalization, it can become a threat to the diversity of local culture. Some argue that globalization may ultimately lead to Westernization or Americanization of culture, where the dominating cultural concepts of economically and politically powerful Western countries spread and cause harm to local cultures.

Globalization is a diverse phenomenon that relates to a multilateral political world and to the increase of cultural objects and markets between countries. The Indian experience particularly reveals the plurality of the impact of cultural globalization.

Transculturalism is defined as &quot;seeing oneself in the other&quot;. Transcultural is in turn described as &quot;extending through all human cultures&quot; or &quot;involving, encompassing, or combining elements of more than one culture&quot;. Children brought up in transcultural backgrounds are sometimes called third-culture kids.

==Political globalization==


Political globalization refers to the growth of the worldwide political system, both in size and complexity. That system includes national governments, their governmental and intergovernmental organizations as well as government-independent elements of global civil society such as international non-governmental organizations and social movement organizations. One of the key aspects of the political globalization is the declining importance of the nation-state and the rise of other actors on the political scene.
William R. Thompson has defined it as &quot;the expansion of a global political system, and its institutions, in which inter-regional transactions (including, but certainly not limited to trade) are managed&quot;. 
Political globalization is one of the three main dimensions of globalization commonly found in academic literature, with the two other being economic globalization and cultural globalization.

Intergovernmentalism is a term in political science with two meanings. The first refers to a theory of regional integration originally proposed by Stanley Hoffmann; the second treats states and the national government as the primary factors for integration. Multi-level governance is an approach in political science and public administration theory that originated from studies on European integration. Multi-level governance gives expression to the idea that there are many interacting authority structures at work in the emergent global political economy. It illuminates the intimate entanglement between the domestic and international levels of authority.

Some people are citizens of multiple nation-states. Multiple citizenship, also called dual citizenship or multiple nationality or dual nationality, is a person&#x27;s citizenship status, in which a person is concurrently regarded as a citizen of more than one state under the laws of those states.
Increasingly, non-governmental organizations influence public policy across national boundaries, including humanitarian aid and developmental efforts. Philanthropic organizations with global missions are also coming to the forefront of humanitarian efforts; charities such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Accion International, the Acumen Fund (now Acumen) and the Echoing Green have combined the business model with philanthropy, giving rise to business organizations such as the Global Philanthropy Group and new associations of philanthropists such as the Global Philanthropy Forum. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation projects include a current multibillion-dollar commitment to funding immunizations in some of the world&#x27;s more impoverished but rapidly growing countries. The Hudson Institute estimates total private philanthropic flows to developing countries at US$59 billion in 2010.

As a response to globalization, some countries have embraced isolationist policies. For example, the North Korean government makes it very difficult for foreigners to enter the country and strictly monitors their activities when they do. Aid workers are subject to considerable scrutiny and excluded from places and regions the government does not wish them to enter. Citizens cannot freely leave the country.

=== Globalization and gender ===

Globalization has been a gendered process where giant multinational corporations have outsourced jobs to low-wage, low skilled, quota free economies like the ready made garment industry in Bangladesh where poor women make up the majority of labor force. Despite a large proportion of women workers in the garment industry, women are still heavily underemployed compared to men. Most women that are employed in the garment industry come from the countryside of Bangladesh triggering migration of women in search of garment work. It is still unclear as to whether or not access to paid work for women where it did not exist before has empowered them. The answers varied depending on whether it is the employers perspective or the workers and how they view their choices. Women workers did not see the garment industry as economically sustainable for them in the long run due to long hours standing and poor working conditions. Although women workers did show significant autonomy over their personal lives including their ability to negotiate with family, more choice in marriage, and being valued as a wage earner in the family. This did not translate into workers being able to collectively organize themselves in order to negotiate a better deal for themselves at work.

Another example of outsourcing in manufacturing includes the maquiladora industry in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico where poor women make up the majority of the labor force. Women in the maquiladora industry have produced high levels of turnover not staying long enough to be trained compared to men. A gendered two tiered system within the maquiladora industry has been created that focuses on training and worker loyalty. Women are seen as being untrainable, placed in un-skilled, low wage jobs, while men are seen as more trainable with less turnover rates, and placed in more high skilled technical jobs. The idea of training has become a tool used against women to blame them for their high turnover rates which also benefit the industry keeping women as temporary workers.

==Other dimensions==
Scholars also occasionally discuss other, less common dimensions of globalization, such as environmental globalization (the internationally coordinated practices and regulations, often in the form of international treaties, regarding environmental protection) or military globalization (growth in global extent and scope of security relationships). Those dimensions, however, receive much less attention the three described above, as academic literature commonly subdivides globalization into three major areas: economic globalization, cultural globalization and political globalization.

===Movement of people===
An essential aspect of globalization is movement of people, and state-boundary limits on that movement have changed across history. The movement of tourists and business people opened up over the last century. As transportation technology improved, travel time and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century. For example, travel across the Atlantic Ocean used to take up to 5 weeks in the 18th century, but around the time of the 20th century it took a mere 8 days. Today, modern aviation has made long-distance transportation quick and affordable.

Tourism is travel for pleasure. The developments in technology and transportation infrastructure, such as jumbo jets, low-cost airlines, and more accessible airports have made many types of tourism more affordable. At any given moment half a million people are in the air. International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012.
A visa is a conditional authorization granted by a country to a foreigner, allowing them to enter and temporarily remain within, or to leave that country. Some countries – such as those in the Schengen Area – have agreements with other countries allowing each other&#x27;s citizens to travel between them without visas (for example, Switzerland is part of a Schengen Agreement allowing easy travel for people from countries within the European Union). The World Tourism Organization announced that the number of tourists who require a visa before traveling was at its lowest level ever in 2015.

Immigration is the international movement of people into a destination country of which they are not natives or where they do not possess citizenship in order to settle or reside there, especially as permanent residents or naturalized citizens, or to take-up employment as a migrant worker or temporarily as a foreign worker. According to the International Labour Organization, there were an estimated 232 million international migrants in the world (defined as persons outside their country of origin for 12 months or more) and approximately half of them were estimated to be economically active (i.e. being employed or seeking employment). International movement of labor is often seen as important to economic development. For example, freedom of movement for workers in the European Union means that people can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country.
Globalization is associated with a dramatic rise in international education. The development of global cross-cultural competence in the workforce through ad-hoc training has deserved increasing attention in recent times. More and more students are seeking higher education in foreign countries and many international students now consider overseas study a stepping-stone to permanent residency within a country. The contributions that foreign students make to host nation economies, both culturally and financially has encouraged major players to implement further initiatives to facilitate the arrival and integration of overseas students, including substantial amendments to immigration and visa policies and procedures.

A transnational marriage is a marriage between two people from different countries. A variety of special issues arise in marriages between people from different countries, including those related to citizenship and culture, which add complexity and challenges to these kinds of relationships. In an age of increasing globalization, where a growing number of people have ties to networks of people and places across the globe, rather than to a current geographic location, people are increasingly marrying across national boundaries. Transnational marriage is a by-product of the movement and migration of people.

===Movement of information===


Before electronic communications, long-distance communications relied on mail. Speed of global communications was limited by the maximum speed of courier services (especially horses and ships) until the mid-19th century. The electric telegraph was the first method of instant long-distance communication. For example, before the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas took weeks because ships had to carry mail across the ocean. The first transatlantic cable reduced communication time considerably, allowing a message and a response in the same day. Lasting transatlantic telegraph connections were achieved in the 1865–1866. The first wireless telegraphy transmitters were developed in 1895.

The Internet has been instrumental in connecting people across geographical boundaries. For example, Facebook is a social networking service which has more than 1.65 billion monthly active users .

Globalization can be spread by Global journalism which provides massive information and relies on the internet to interact, &quot;makes it into an everyday routine to investigate how people and their actions, practices, problems, life conditions, etc. in different parts of the world are interrelated. possible to assume that global threats such as climate change precipitate the further establishment of global journalism.&quot;

===Globalization and disease===

In the current era of globalization, the world is more interdependent than at any other time. Efficient and inexpensive transportation has left few places inaccessible, and increased global trade has brought more and more people into contact with animal diseases that have subsequently jumped species barriers (see zoonosis).

Coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated COVID-19, first appeared in Wuhan, China in November 2019. More than 180 countries have reported cases since then. , the U.S. has the most confirmed active cases in the world. More than 3.4 million people from the worst-affected countries entered the U.S. in the first three months since the inception of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has caused a detrimental impact on the global economy, particularly for SME&#x27;s and Microbusinesses with unlimited liability/self-employed, leaving them vulnerable to financial difficulties, increasing the market share for oligopolistic markets as well as increasing the barriers of entry.

==Measurement==
One index of globalization is the &quot;KOF Index of Globalization&quot;, which measures three important dimensions of globalization: economic, social, and political. Another is the A.T. Kearney / Foreign Policy Magazine Globalization Index.
Measurements of economic globalization typically focus on variables such as trade, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP), portfolio investment, and income. However, newer indices attempt to measure globalization in more general terms, including variables related to political, social, cultural, and even environmental aspects of globalization.

The DHL Global Connectedness Index studies four main types of cross-border flow: trade (in both goods and services), information, people (including tourists, students, and migrants), and capital. It shows that the depth of global integration fell by about one-tenth after 2008, but by 2013 had recovered well above its pre-crash peak. The report also found a shift of economic activity to emerging economies.

==Support and criticism==

Reactions to processes contributing to globalization have varied widely with a history as long as extraterritorial contact and trade. Philosophical differences regarding the costs and benefits of such processes give rise to a broad-range of ideologies and social movements. Proponents of economic growth, expansion, and development, in general, view globalizing processes as desirable or necessary to the well-being of human society.

Antagonists view one or more globalizing processes as detrimental to social well-being on a global or local scale; this includes those who focus on social or natural sustainability of long-term and continuous economic expansion, the social structural inequality caused by these processes, and the colonial, imperialistic, or hegemonic ethnocentrism, cultural assimilation and cultural appropriation that underlie such processes.

Globalization tends to bring people into contact with foreign people and cultures. Xenophobia is the fear of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange. Xenophobia can manifest itself in many ways involving the relations and perceptions of an ingroup towards an outgroup, including a fear of losing identity, suspicion of its activities, aggression, and desire to eliminate its presence to secure a presumed purity.

Critiques of globalization generally stem from discussions surrounding the impact of such processes on the planet as well as the human costs. They challenge directly traditional metrics, such as GDP, and look to other measures, such as the Gini coefficient or the Happy Planet Index, and point to a &quot;multitude of interconnected fatal consequences–social disintegration, a breakdown of democracy, more rapid and extensive deterioration of the environment, the spread of new diseases, increasing poverty and alienation&quot; which they claim are the unintended consequences of globalization. Others point out that, while the forces of globalization have led to the spread of western-style democracy, this has been accompanied by an increase in inter-ethnic tension and violence as free market economic policies combine with democratic processes of universal suffrage as well as an escalation in militarization to impose democratic principles and as a means to conflict resolution.

On 9 August 2019, Pope Francis denounced isolationism and hinted that the Catholic Church will embrace globalization at the October 2019 Amazonia Synod, stating &quot;the whole is greater than the parts. Globalization and unity should not be conceived as a sphere, but as a polyhedron: each people retains its identity in unity with others&quot;

===Public opinion===
As a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, globalization is considered by some as a form of capitalist expansion which entails the integration of local and national economies into a global, unregulated market economy. A 2005 study by Peer Fis and Paul Hirsch found a large increase in articles negative towards globalization in the years prior. In 1998, negative articles outpaced positive articles by two to one. The number of newspaper articles showing negative framing rose from about 10% of the total in 1991 to 55% of the total in 1999. This increase occurred during a period when the total number of articles concerning globalization nearly doubled.

A number of international polls have shown that residents of Africa and Asia tend to view globalization more favorably than residents of Europe or North America. In Africa, a Gallup poll found that 70% of the population views globalization favorably. The BBC found that 50% of people believed that economic globalization was proceeding too rapidly, while 35% believed it was proceeding too slowly.

In 2004, Philip Gordon stated that &quot;a clear majority of Europeans believe that globalization can enrich their lives, while believing the European Union can help them take advantage of globalization&#x27;s benefits while shielding them from its negative effects&quot;. The main opposition consisted of socialists, environmental groups, and nationalists. Residents of the EU did not appear to feel threatened by globalization in 2004. The EU job market was more stable and workers were less likely to accept wage/benefit cuts. Social spending was much higher than in the US. In a Danish poll in 2007, 76% responded that globalization is a good thing.

Fiss, &quot;et al.&quot;, surveyed US opinion in 1993. Their survey showed that, in 1993, more than 40% of respondents were unfamiliar with the concept of globalization. When the survey was repeated in 1998, 89% of the respondents had a polarized view of globalization as being either good or bad. At the same time, discourse on globalization, which began in the financial community before shifting to a heated debate between proponents and disenchanted students and workers. Polarization increased dramatically after the establishment of the WTO in 1995; this event and subsequent protests led to a large-scale anti-globalization movement.
Initially, college educated workers were likely to support globalization. Less educated workers, who were more likely to compete with immigrants and workers in developing countries, tended to be opponents. The situation changed after the Great Recession. According to a 1997 poll 58% of college graduates said globalization had been good for the US. By 2008 only 33% thought it was good. Respondents with high school education also became more opposed.

According to Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi, there was a perception in Japan that the economy was &quot;Small and Frail&quot;. However, Japan was resource-poor and used exports to pay for its raw materials. Anxiety over their position caused terms such as &quot;internationalization&quot; and &quot;globalization&quot; to enter everyday language. However, Japanese tradition was to be as self-sufficient as possible, particularly in agriculture.

Many in developing countries see globalization as a positive force that lifts them out of poverty. Those opposing globalization typically combine environmental concerns with nationalism. Opponents consider governments as agents of neo-colonialism that are subservient to multinational corporations. Much of this criticism comes from the middle class; the Brookings Institution suggested this was because the middle class perceived upwardly mobile low-income groups as threatening to their economic security.

===Economics===
The literature analyzing the economics of free trade is extremely rich with extensive work having been done on the theoretical and empirical effects. Though it creates winners and losers, the broad consensus among economists is that free trade is a large and unambiguous net gain for society. In a 2006 survey of 83 American economists, &quot;87.5% agree that the U.S. should eliminate remaining tariffs and other barriers to trade&quot; and &quot;90.1% disagree with the suggestion that the U.S. should restrict employers from outsourcing work to foreign countries.&quot;

Quoting Harvard economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw, &quot;Few propositions command as much consensus among professional economists as that open world trade increases economic growth and raises living standards.&quot; In a survey of leading economists, none disagreed with the notion that &quot;freer trade improves productive efficiency and offers consumers better choices, and in the long run these gains are much larger than any effects on employment.&quot; Most economists would agree that although increasing returns to scale might mean that certain industry could settle in a geographical area without any strong economic reason derived from comparative advantage, this is not a reason to argue against free trade because the absolute level of output enjoyed by both &quot;winner&quot; and &quot;loser&quot; will increase with the &quot;winner&quot; gaining more than the &quot;loser&quot; but both gaining more than before in an absolute level.

In the book &quot;The End of Poverty&quot;, Jeffrey Sachs discusses how many factors can affect a country&#x27;s ability to enter the world market, including government corruption; legal and social disparities based on gender, ethnicity, or caste; diseases such as AIDS and malaria; lack of infrastructure (including transportation, communications, health, and trade); unstable political landscapes; protectionism; and geographic barriers. Jagdish Bhagwati, a former adviser to the U.N. on globalization, holds that, although there are obvious problems with overly rapid development, globalization is a very positive force that lifts countries out of poverty by causing a virtuous economic cycle associated with faster economic growth. However, economic growth does not necessarily mean a reduction in poverty; in fact, the two can coexist. Economic growth is conventionally measured using indicators such as GDP and GNI that do not accurately reflect the growing disparities in wealth. Additionally, Oxfam International argues that poor people are often excluded from globalization-induced opportunities &quot;by a lack of productive assets, weak infrastructure, poor education and ill-health;&quot; effectively leaving these marginalized groups in a poverty trap. Economist Paul Krugman is another staunch supporter of globalization and free trade with a record of disagreeing with many critics of globalization. He argues that many of them lack a basic understanding of comparative advantage and its importance in today&#x27;s world.

The flow of migrants to advanced economies has been claimed to provide a means through which global wages converge. An IMF study noted a potential for skills to be transferred back to developing countries as wages in those a countries rise. Lastly, the dissemination of knowledge has been an integral aspect of globalization. Technological innovations (or technological transfer) are conjectured to benefit most developing and least developing countries (LDCs), as for example in the adoption of mobile phones.

There has been a rapid economic growth in Asia after embracing market orientation-based economic policies that encourage private property rights, free enterprise and competition. In particular, in East Asian developing countries, GDP per head rose at 5.9% a year from 1975 to 2001 (according to 2003 Human Development Report of UNDP). Like this, the British economic journalist Martin Wolf says that incomes of poor developing countries, with more than half the world&#x27;s population, grew substantially faster than those of the world&#x27;s richest countries that remained relatively stable in its growth, leading to reduced international inequality and the incidence of poverty.
Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active economic liberalization and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality. According to Wolf, in the developing world as a whole, life expectancy rose by four months each year after 1970 and infant mortality rate declined from 107 per thousand in 1970 to 58 in 2000 due to improvements in standards of living and health conditions. Also, adult literacy in developing countries rose from 53% in 1970 to 74% in 1998 and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes. Furthermore, the reduction in fertility rate in the developing world as a whole from 4.1 births per woman in 1980 to 2.8 in 2000 indicates improved education level of women on fertility, and control of fewer children with more parental attention and investment. Consequently, more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of child labor. Thus, despite seemingly unequal distribution of income within these developing countries, their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole.

Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) growth among post-1980 globalizing countries accelerated from 1.4 percent a year in the 1960s and 2.9 percent a year in the 1970s to 3.5 percent in the 1980s and 5.0 percent in the 1990s. This acceleration in growth seems even more remarkable given that the rich countries saw steady declines in growth from a high of 4.7 percent in the 1960s to 2.2 percent in the 1990s. Also, the non-globalizing developing countries seem to fare worse than the globalizers, with the former&#x27;s annual growth rates falling from highs of 3.3 percent during the 1970s to only 1.4 percent during the 1990s. This rapid growth among the globalizers is not simply due to the strong performances of China and India in the 1980s and 1990s—18 out of the 24 globalizers experienced increases in growth, many of them quite substantial.
The globalization of the late 20th and early 21st centuries has led to the resurfacing of the idea that the growth of economic interdependence promotes peace. This idea had been very powerful during the globalization of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and was a central doctrine of classical liberals of that era, such as the young John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946).

Some opponents of globalization see the phenomenon as a promotion of corporate interests. They also claim that the increasing autonomy and strength of corporate entities shapes the political policy of countries. They advocate global institutions and policies that they believe better address the moral claims of poor and working classes as well as environmental concerns. Economic arguments by fair trade theorists claim that unrestricted free trade benefits those with more financial leverage (i.e. the rich) at the expense of the poor.

Globalization allows corporations to outsource manufacturing and service jobs from high-cost locations, creating economic opportunities with the most competitive wages and worker benefits. Critics of globalization say that it disadvantages poorer countries. While it is true that free trade encourages globalization among countries, some countries try to protect their domestic suppliers. The main export of poorer countries is usually agricultural productions. Larger countries often subsidize their farmers (e.g., the EU&#x27;s Common Agricultural Policy), which lowers the market price for foreign crops.

===Global democracy===
Democratic globalization is a movement towards an institutional system of global democracy that would give world citizens a say in political organizations. This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate oligopolies, ideological non-governmental organizations (NGO), political cults and mafias. One of its most prolific proponents is the British political thinker David Held. Advocates of democratic globalization argue that economic expansion and development should be the first phase of democratic globalization, which is to be followed by a phase of building global political institutions. Francesco Stipo, Director of the United States Association of the Club of Rome, advocates unifying nations under a world government, suggesting that it &quot;should reflect the political and economic balances of world nations. A world confederation would not supersede the authority of the State governments but rather complement it, as both the States and the world authority would have power within their sphere of competence&quot;. Former Canadian Senator Douglas Roche, O.C., viewed globalization as inevitable and advocated creating institutions such as a directly elected United Nations Parliamentary Assembly to exercise oversight over unelected international bodies.

===Global civics===

Global civics suggests that civics can be understood, in a global sense, as a social contract between global citizens in the age of interdependence and interaction. The disseminators of the concept define it as the notion that we have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth. World citizen has a variety of similar meanings, often referring to a person who disapproves of traditional geopolitical divisions derived from national citizenship. An early incarnation of this sentiment can be found in Socrates, whom Plutarch quoted as saying: &quot;I am not an Athenian, or a Greek, but a citizen of the world.&quot; In an increasingly interdependent world, world citizens need a compass to frame their mindsets and create a shared consciousness and sense of global responsibility in world issues such as environmental problems and nuclear proliferation.

Baha&#x27;i-inspired author Meyjes, while favoring the single world community and emergent global consciousness, warns of globalization as a cloak for an expeditious economic, social, and cultural Anglo-dominance that is insufficiently inclusive to inform the emergence of an optimal world civilization. He proposes a process of &quot;universalization&quot; as an alternative.

Cosmopolitanism is the proposal that all human ethnic groups belong to a single community based on a shared morality. A person who adheres to the idea of cosmopolitanism in any of its forms is called a cosmopolitan or cosmopolite. A cosmopolitan community might be based on an inclusive morality, a shared economic relationship, or a political structure that encompasses different nations. The cosmopolitan community is one in which individuals from different places (e.g. nation-states) form relationships based on mutual respect. For instance, Kwame Anthony Appiah suggests the possibility of a cosmopolitan community in which individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.) enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing beliefs (religious, political, etc.).

Canadian philosopher Marshall McLuhan popularized the term &quot;Global Village&quot; beginning in 1962. His view suggested that globalization would lead to a world where people from all countries will become more integrated and aware of common interests and shared humanity.

===International cooperation===

Military cooperation – Past examples of international cooperation exist. One example is the security cooperation between the United States and the former Soviet Union after the end of the Cold War, which astonished international society. Arms control and disarmament agreements, including the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (see START I, START II, START III, and New START) and the establishment of NATO&#x27;s Partnership for Peace, the Russia NATO Council, and the G8 Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, constitute concrete initiatives of arms control and de-nuclearization. The US–Russian cooperation was further strengthened by anti-terrorism agreements enacted in the wake of 9/11.

Environmental cooperation – One of the biggest successes of environmental cooperation has been the agreement to reduce chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions, as specified in the Montreal Protocol, in order to stop ozone depletion. The most recent debate around nuclear energy and the non-alternative coal-burning power plants constitutes one more consensus on what not to do. Thirdly, significant achievements in IC can be observed through development studies.

Economic cooperation – One of the biggest challenges in 2019 with globalization is that many believe the progress made in the past decades are now back tracking. The back tracking of globalization has coined the term &quot;Slobalization.&quot; Slobalization is a new, slower pattern of globalization.

===Anti-globalization movement===

Anti-globalization, or counter-globalization, consists of a number of criticisms of globalization but, in general, is critical of the globalization of corporate capitalism. The movement is also commonly referred to as the alter-globalization movement, anti-globalist movement, anti-corporate globalization movement, or movement against neoliberal globalization. Opponents of globalization argue that power and respect in terms of international trade between the developed and underdeveloped countries of the world are unequally distributed. The diverse subgroups that make up this movement include some of the following: trade unionists, environmentalists, anarchists, land rights and indigenous rights activists, organizations promoting human rights and sustainable development, opponents of privatization, and anti-sweatshop campaigners.

In &quot;The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy&quot;, Christopher Lasch analyzed the widening gap between the top and bottom of the social composition in the United States. For him, our epoch is determined by a social phenomenon: the revolt of the elites, in reference to &quot;The Revolt of the Masses&quot; (1929) by the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset. According to Lasch, the new elites, i.e. those who are in the top 20% in terms of income, through globalization which allows total mobility of capital, no longer live in the same world as their fellow-citizens. In this, they oppose the old bourgeoisie of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which was constrained by its spatial stability to a minimum of rooting and civic obligations. Globalization, according to the sociologist, has turned elites into tourists in their own countries. The denationalization of business enterprise tends to produce a class who see themselves as &quot;world citizens, but without accepting ... any of the obligations that citizenship in a polity normally implies&quot;. Their ties to an international culture of work, leisure, information – make many of them deeply indifferent to the prospect of national decline. Instead of financing public services and the public treasury, new elites are investing their money in improving their voluntary ghettos: private schools in their residential neighborhoods, private police, garbage collection systems. They have &quot;withdrawn from common life&quot;. Composed of those who control the international flows of capital and information, who preside over philanthropic foundations and institutions of higher education, manage the instruments of cultural production and thus fix the terms of public debate. So, the political debate is limited mainly to the dominant classes and political ideologies lose all contact with the concerns of the ordinary citizen. The result of this is that no one has a likely solution to these problems and that there are furious ideological battles on related issues. However, they remain protected from the problems affecting the working classes: the decline of industrial activity, the resulting loss of employment, the decline of the middle class, increasing the number of the poor, the rising crime rate, growing drug trafficking, the urban crisis.

D.A. Snow et al. contend that the anti-globalization movement is an example of a new social movement, which uses tactics that are unique and use different resources than previously used before in other social movements.

One of the most infamous tactics of the movement is the Battle of Seattle in 1999, where there were protests against the World Trade Organization&#x27;s Third Ministerial Meeting. All over the world, the movement has held protests outside meetings of institutions such as the WTO, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the World Economic Forum, and the Group of Eight (G8). Within the Seattle demonstrations the protesters that participated used both creative and violent tactics to gain the attention towards the issue of globalization.

===Opposition to capital market integration===

Capital markets have to do with raising and investing money in various human enterprises. Increasing integration of these financial markets between countries leads to the emergence of a global capital marketplace or a single world market. In the long run, increased movement of capital between countries tends to favor owners of capital more than any other group; in the short run, owners and workers in specific sectors in capital-exporting countries bear much of the burden of adjusting to increased movement of capital.

Those opposed to capital market integration on the basis of human rights issues are especially disturbed by the various abuses which they think are perpetuated by global and international institutions that, they say, promote neoliberalism without regard to ethical standards. Common targets include the World Bank (WB), International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) and free trade treaties like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). In light of the economic gap between rich and poor countries, movement adherents claim free trade without measures in place to protect the under-capitalized will contribute only to the strengthening the power of industrialized nations (often termed the &quot;North&quot; in opposition to the developing world&#x27;s &quot;South&quot;).

===Anti-corporatism and anti-consumerism===
Corporatist ideology, which privileges the rights of corporations (artificial or juridical persons) over those of natural persons, is an underlying factor in the recent rapid expansion of global commerce. In recent years, there have been an increasing number of books (Naomi Klein&#x27;s 2000 &quot;No Logo&quot;, for example) and films (&quot;e.g. The Corporation&quot; &amp; &quot;Surplus&quot;) popularizing an anti-corporate ideology to the public.

A related contemporary ideology, consumerism, which encourages the personal acquisition of goods and services, also drives globalization. Anti-consumerism is a social movement against equating personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions. Concern over the treatment of consumers by large corporations has spawned substantial activism, and the incorporation of consumer education into school curricula. Social activists hold materialism is connected to global retail merchandizing and supplier convergence, war, greed, anomie, crime, environmental degradation, and general social malaise and discontent. One variation on this topic is activism by &quot;postconsumers&quot;, with the strategic emphasis on moving &quot;beyond&quot; addictive consumerism.

===Global justice and inequality===
====Global justice====

The global justice movement is the loose collection of individuals and groups—often referred to as a &quot;movement of movements&quot;—who advocate fair trade rules and perceive current institutions of global economic integration as problems. The movement is often labeled an anti-globalization movement by the mainstream media. Those involved, however, frequently deny that they are anti-globalization, insisting that they support the globalization of communication and people and oppose only the global expansion of corporate power. The movement is based in the idea of social justice, desiring the creation of a society or institution based on the principles of equality and solidarity, the values of human rights, and the dignity of every human being. Social inequality within and between nations, including a growing global digital divide, is a focal point of the movement. Many nongovernmental organizations have now arisen to fight these inequalities that many in Latin America, Africa and Asia face. A few very popular and well known non-governmental organizations (NGOs) include: War Child, Red Cross, Free The Children and CARE International. They often create partnerships where they work towards improving the lives of those who live in developing countries by building schools, fixing infrastructure, cleaning water supplies, purchasing equipment and supplies for hospitals, and other aid efforts.

====Social inequality====

The economies of the world have developed unevenly, historically, such that entire geographical regions were left mired in poverty and disease while others began to reduce poverty and disease on a wholesale basis. From around 1980 through at least 2011, the GDP gap, while still wide, appeared to be closing and, in some more rapidly developing countries, life expectancies began to rise. If we look at the Gini coefficient for world income, since the late 1980s, the gap between some regions has markedly narrowed—between Asia and the advanced economies of the West, for example—but huge gaps remain globally. Overall equality across humanity, considered as individuals, has improved very little. Within the decade between 2003 and 2013, income inequality grew even in traditionally egalitarian countries like Germany, Sweden and Denmark. With a few exceptions—France, Japan, Spain—the top 10 percent of earners in most advanced economies raced ahead, while the bottom 10 percent fell further behind. By 2013, 85 multibillionaires had amassed wealth equivalent to all the wealth owned by the poorest half (3.5 billion) of the world&#x27;s total population of 7 billion.

Critics of globalization argue that globalization results in weak labor unions: the surplus in cheap labor coupled with an ever-growing number of companies in transition weakened labor unions in high-cost areas. Unions become less effective and workers their enthusiasm for unions when membership begins to decline. They also cite an increase in the exploitation of child labor: countries with weak protections for children are vulnerable to infestation by rogue companies and criminal gangs who exploit them. Examples include quarrying, salvage, and farm work as well as trafficking, bondage, forced labor, prostitution and pornography.
Women often participate in the workforce in precarious work, including export-oriented employment. Evidence suggests that while globalization has expanded women&#x27;s access to employment, the long-term goal of transforming gender inequalities remains unmet and appears unattainable without regulation of capital and a reorientation and expansion of the state&#x27;s role in funding public goods and providing a social safety net. Furthermore, the intersectionality of gender, race, class, can be overlooked by scholars and commentators when assessing the impact of globalization.

In 2016, a study published by the IMF posited that neoliberalism, the ideological backbone of contemporary globalized capitalism, has been &quot;oversold&quot;, with the benefits of neoliberal policies being &quot;fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries&quot; and the costs, most significantly higher income inequality within nations, &quot;hurt the level and sustainability of growth.&quot;

===Anti-global governance===
Beginning in the 1930s, opposition arose to the idea of a world government, as advocated by organizations such as the World Federalist Movement (WFM). Those who oppose global governance typically do so on objections that the idea is unfeasible, inevitably oppressive, or simply unnecessary. In general, these opponents are wary of the concentration of power or wealth that such governance might represent. Such reasoning dates back to the founding of the League of Nations and, later, the United Nations.

===Environmentalist opposition===

Environmentalism is a broad philosophy, ideology and social movement regarding concerns for environmental conservation and improvement of the health of the environment. Environmentalist concerns with globalization include issues such as global warming, global water supply and water crises, inequity in energy consumption and energy conservation, transnational air pollution and pollution of the world ocean, overpopulation, world habitat sustainability, deforestation, biodiversity loss and species extinction.

One critique of globalization is that natural resources of the poor have been systematically taken over by the rich and the pollution promulgated by the rich is systematically dumped on the poor. Some argue that Northern corporations are increasingly exploiting resources of less wealthy countries for their global activities while it is the South that is disproportionately bearing the environmental burden of the globalized economy. Globalization is thus leading to a type of&quot; environmental apartheid&quot;.

Helena Norberg-Hodge, the director and founder of Local Futures/International Society for Ecology and Culture, criticizes globalization in many ways. In her book &quot;Ancient Futures&quot;, Norberg-Hodge claims that &quot;centuries of ecological balance and social harmony are under threat from the pressures of development and globalization.&quot; She also criticizes the standardization and rationalization of globalization, as it does not always yield the expected growth outcomes. Although globalization takes similar steps in most countries, scholars such as Hodge claim that it might not be effective to certain countries and that globalization has actually moved some countries backward instead of developing them.

A related area of concern is the pollution haven hypothesis, which posits that, when large industrialized nations seek to set up factories or offices abroad, they will often look for the cheapest option in terms of resources and labor that offers the land and material access they require (see Race to the bottom). This often comes at the cost of environmentally sound practices. Developing countries with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent environmental regulations, and conversely, nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies as a result of the costs associated with meeting these standards. Thus, companies that choose to physically invest in foreign countries tend to (re)locate to the countries with the lowest environmental standards or weakest enforcement.

The European Union–Mercosur Free Trade Agreement, which would form one of the world&#x27;s largest free trade areas, has been denounced by environmental activists and indigenous rights campaigners. The fear is that the deal could lead to more deforestation of the Amazon rainforest as it expands market access to Brazilian beef.

<text>Chowder is a thick soup prepared with milk or cream, a roux, and seafood or vegetables. Oyster crackers or saltines may accompany chowders as a side item, and cracker pieces may be dropped atop the dish. 

Clam chowder from New England is typically made with chopped clams and diced potatoes, in a mixed cream and milk base, often with a small amount of butter. Other common chowders include seafood chowder, which often consists of fish, clams, and other types of shellfish; lamb or veal chowder made with barley; corn chowder, which uses corn instead of clams; various fish chowders; and potato chowder, which is often made with cheese. Fish, corn, and clam chowders are popular in North America, especially Atlantic Canada and New England.

==Etymology==
The origin of the term &quot;chowder&quot; is obscure. One possible source is the French word &quot;chaudron&quot;, the French word for cauldron, the type of cooking or heating stove on which the first chowders were probably cooked. &quot;Chodier&quot; was also a name for a cooking pot in the Creole language of the French Caribbean islands. Additionally, a Portuguese, Brazilian, Galician and Basque fish and shellfish stew is known as &quot;caldeirada&quot; which appears to have a similar etymology. 

Another possible source of the word &quot;chowder&quot; could be the French dish called &quot;chaudrée&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;chauderée&quot;), which is a thick fish soup from the coastal regions of Charente-Maritime and Vendée. Yet another etymology could be the Quebecois French word &quot;chaudière&quot;, which means &quot;bucket&quot;.

In the sixteenth century in Cornwall and Devon the dialectal word &quot;jowter&quot; was used to describe hawkers, particularly fishmongers, which later turned into &quot;chowder&quot; and &quot;chowter&quot;. However, this is not cited by the Oxford English Dictionary as a possible source due to controversy regarding the origins of the dish itself. The earliest citation the &quot;OED&quot; gives for the word used in its current sense of a fish-based stew is American.

==History==
Chowder as it is known today originated as a shipboard dish, and was thickened with the use of hardtack. Chowder was brought to North America with immigrants from England and France and seafarers more than 250 years ago. It became popular for its flavour, and is now used widely for its simple preparation.
An early description of chowder is found in the journal kept by the young botanist Joseph Banks, who visited English and French Labrador fisheries in 1766. Banks gives an account of chowder, which he described as &quot;Peculiar to this Country&quot;, and its preparation. Even though it was unfamiliar, he stated that &quot;when well made a Luxury that the rich Even in England at Least in my opinion might be fond of It is a Soup made with a small Quantity of salt Pork cut into Small Slices a good deal of fish and Biscuit Boyled for about an hour&quot;.

Chowder was not utterly unfamiliar in England at the time, as in &quot;Sir Launcelot Greaves&quot; (1762) Tobias Smollett has one character state, &quot;My head sings and simmers like a pot of chowder&quot;. A Manx sailor in his memoirs recalls a meal made aboard a British ship on a voyage through the Caribbean in 1786: &quot;...we frequently served up a mess called &quot;chowder&quot;, consisting of a mixture of fresh fish, salt pork, pounded biscuit and onions; and which, when well seasoned and stewed, we found to be an excellent palatable dish.&quot; Cookbooks of the period included recipes for &quot;Chowder, a Sea Dish&quot; which might be thicker than a soup: in 1830 an English baked dish made with salmon and potato was called a chowder.

In 1890, in the magazine &quot;American Notes and Queries&quot;, it was said that the dish was of French origin. Among French settlers in Canada, it was a custom to stew clams and fish laid in courses with bacon, sea biscuits, and other ingredients in a bucket called a &quot;chaudière&quot;. The Native Americans adopted it as &quot;chawder&quot;, and the name (and the dish) eventually became &quot;chowder&quot; in the United States. After the Revolutionary war, the fourth of July was celebrated with picnics, fireworks, dances and dinners. The foods served varied according to the customs of each region. Chowder was one of the dishes commonly served for the celebrations in the northern United States.

In the United States, early chowder making is traced to New England. It was a bowl of simmering chowder by the seaside that provided in its basic form &quot;sustenance of body and mind – a marker of hearth and home, community, family and culture&quot;. It evolved along the coastal shoreline of New England as a &quot;congerie&quot; of simple things, very basic and cooked simply. It is a simple dish of salt and pepper, potatoes and onion, pork and fish, cream and hard crackers, and not a sophisticated dish of the elite. Its simplicity made it attractive and it became a regional dish of the New Englanders, and their favourite recipe was &quot;chowder master&quot;. &quot;Symbolically, functionally, mnemonically or dynamically&quot; chowder has become a community-defining symbol for New Englanders. Etta M. Madden and Martha L. Finch observe that chowder provides &quot;visceral memories that provided feelings of familiarity, comfort and continuity&quot;.

A recipe formulated and published in 1894 by Charles Ranhofer, a famous chef of Delmonico&#x27;s restaurant, was called &quot;Chowder de Lucines&quot; and had ingredients of pork, clams, potato (sliced to a seven sixteenths-inch size), onion, parsley, tomato, crackers garnished by thyme, salt and pepper. Others in the same family, totally different from the New England clam chowder, are: &quot;Fulton Market style&quot;, introduced in 1904 and made from clams, tomatoes, allspice, cloves, red pepper, and Worcester sauce; a &quot;Vegetable Clam Chowder&quot; introduced in 1929 and made of clams, chopped onions, diced carrots, stewed tomatoes, and thyme; &quot;Coney Island Clam Chowder&quot;; &quot;New York Clam Chowder&quot;; and &quot;Manhattan Clam Chowder&quot;, a late entry after 1930.

In most cases, particularly in the Maritime Provinces, Canadian chowder is thinner and more seafood-forward than its creamier American counterparts.

==Types==
Chowder is a soup with cream or milk mixed with ingredients such as potatoes, sweet corn, smoked haddock, clams and prawns, etc. Some cream-style chowders do not use cream, and are instead prepared using milk and a roux to thicken them. Some of the popular variations are clam chowder and potatoes; seafood chowder; spiced haddock chowder; Irish fish chowder with soda bread; crayfish chowder; clam chowder with cod; British seaside chowder with saffron; thick smoked-haddock chowder; Raymond Blanc&#x27;s light shellfish chowder; New England–style clam chowder traditionally served with oyster crackers; smoked haddock chowder with leeks and sweetcorn; clam, broad bean and salami chowder; and many more. Chowder can be a comfort food, especially during the winter months.

===Bermuda fish===
Considered a national dish of Bermuda, the primary ingredients in Bermuda fish chowder include fish, tomato, and onion that is seasoned with black rum and a sherry pepper sauce. The dish is of British origin, and was brought to the New World by the colonists.

===Clam===

Clam chowder is prepared with clams, diced potato, onion, and sometimes celery. It may be prepared as a cream-style or broth-style soup. Several variations of clam chowder exist, including New England clam chowder, which is a cream-style soup; Manhattan clam chowder, a broth-style soup prepared using tomato, vegetables and clams; Rhode Island clam chowder is a broth-style soup without dairy, and alternatively also includes stewed tomatoes which is known as red chowder; New Jersey clam chowder; Delaware clam chowder; Hatteras clam chowder; and Minorcan clam chowder. In Connecticut clam chowder, milk is used instead of cream. New England clam chowder is made in a diverse variety of styles.

Clam chowder may be prepared with fresh, steamed clams or canned clams. The &quot;clam liquor&quot; from steamed or canned clams may be retained for use in the soup, and fresh or bottled clam juice may be used. January 21 is the National New England Clam Chowder Day in the United States.

In the late 1800s clam chowder was introduced in New Zealand as an &quot;American&quot; dish and has become integral to New Zealand cuisine. A variant of New Zealand clam chowder is &quot;pipi chowder&quot;, also known as &quot;pipi soup&quot; made with New Zealand surf clams. &quot;Pipi&quot; comes from the indigenous Maori name for the shellfish. Although there are variations in ingredients all New Zealand seafood chowders are made in the style of New England chowders, always with milk and/or cream.

===Corn===

Corn chowder is similar in consistency to New England clam chowder, with corn being used instead of clams. Additional vegetables that may be used in its preparation include potatoes, celery and onion. Some are prepared using meats, such as chicken or bacon. Corn chowder may be prepared with fresh, frozen, or canned corn.

===Fish===
Fish chowder is prepared with fish such as salmon or cod, and is similar to clam chowder in ingredients and texture. Ingredients used in fish chowder may include potato, onion, celery, carrot, corn and bacon.

===Smoked salmon===
A popular dish in Pacific Northwest cuisine, smoked salmon chowder gets its red color from tomato paste and is prepared with celery, garlic, leeks, chives, potatoes and Alaskan smoked salmon. The best known smoked salmon chowders are made at Pike Place Market and by Ivar&#x27;s Salmon House, both in Seattle, Washington.

===Southern Illinois===

Southern Illinois chowder, also referred to as &quot;downtown chowder&quot;, is a thick stew or soup that is very different from the New England and Manhattan chowders. The main ingredients are beef, chicken, tomatoes, cabbage, lima beans, and green beans. Traditionally, squirrel meat was a common addition. Southern Illinois chowder is a hearty dish that has been described as being closer in style to burgoo and Brunswick stew than coastal chowders.

===Seafood===
Seafood chowder is prepared with various types of seafood as a primary ingredient, and may be prepared as a broth- or cream-style chowder. It is a popular menu item in New Zealand using ready-prepared mixed seafood, called &quot;seafood marinara&quot;, &quot;marinara mix&quot;, or simply &quot;marinara&quot;. These terms to describe mixed seafood are unique to New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa and not to be confused with the meaning of &quot;marinara&quot; as in marinara sauce.

===Spiced haddock===
Spiced haddock chowder is made with haddock fillets, carrot, potato, plain flour, bay leaves, peppercorns, mustard, and spices added to milk and cooked in a pot with butter.

===Other types===
The White Castle restaurant serves a potato-and-bacon chowder.

==Use of preserved clams==
In North America, as people moved west, some homemade preparations of traditional chowder used canned or bottled clams when fresh clams were not available. In some places the ingredients were modified based upon other locally available foods such as salmon, corn and chicken.

==Commercial varieties==
Mass-produced, canned varieties of chowder are manufactured and purveyed to consumers, such as Campbell&#x27;s and Progresso&#x27;s New England Clam Chowder, among other brands.

<text>Portable soup was a form of dehydrated food of English origin used in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was a precursor of meat extract and bouillon cubes, and of industrially dehydrated and instant food. It is also known as pocket soup or veal glue. It is essentially a partially dehydrated broth and a solid counterpart of the &quot;glace de viande&quot; (meat glaze) used in French cuisine. It was long a staple of British seamen, military and explorers, as it would keep for many months or even a year. In this context, it was considered a filling and nutritious dish.

==Process==
Portable soup was made from a slow-cooked beef or veal broth (often 6 to 8 hours), reduced, degreased to remove the fat (which may spoil and become rancid over time) and then reduced repeatedly until it solidified into a jelly. Once it was sufficiently gelatinous to hold its form, it was placed on pieces of flannel or unglazed earthenware dishes and rotated regularly to dry it further. Historically, this was a seasonal process attempted only in the winter when humidity was low. Once dry, it was wrapped in paper and stored in boxes.

==History==
===Hugh Plat===
In the late sixteenth century, Sir Hugh Plat wrote, in his unpublished notes, of portable soup as a potential military rations for the army and navy, describing it as meat broth boiled down to a thick and dry paste which he called &quot;gelly&quot;. Plat&#x27;s basic recipe was to boil the feet or legs of beef cattle for a long time to make &quot;a good broath&quot; which was then strained and boiled down to &quot;a strong &amp; stiff gelly&quot;. This in turn was dried on clean cloths in a windy place out of the sun, cut with wire into pieces, powdered with flour to stop the pieces from sticking, and stored in wooden boxes.

Made in March, it would &quot;keepe all the yeere&quot; (keep all year). Alternatively, the dry jelly could be &quot;stamped&quot; into shape with a wooden die, like the &quot;Genoa Paste&quot; of quinces familiar to Plat and other cooks of the time. He instructed that no sugar or salt should be added to the jelly because such taste would be concentrated by the boiling process, although he speculated that saffron might add colour, and that rosewater could also be added at this stage. He wondered whether baked flour or grated bread could be incorporated to make the jelly &quot;serve as bread and meate the better&quot;, and whether the addition of isinglass would make it stiffer. The jelly was variously described by Plat as a &quot;Victual for Warr&quot;, &quot;dry gelly carried to the sea&quot;, and a food for soldiers on the march. Plat envisaged using this jelly either as the base for soup, or &quot;neat&quot; as a concentrated food. Reconstitution as soup simply involved dissolving a piece of the jelly in hot water to make &quot;good broath&quot;, and, because jelly and water alone would be rather bland, adding such flavourings as were available or to taste – sugar, salt, liquorice, aniseed, or other &quot;convenient spice&quot;.

Plat emphasised the utility of the jelly as field rations, for &quot;a soldier may satisfie his hunger herwith, whilst hee is in his march&quot;. He recommended that a leg of beef or veal be boiled with every 6 or 8 neats&#x27; (cows&#x27;) feet to produce a jelly which would more easily dissolve in the mouth.

The existence of portable soups (called &quot;bouillons en tablettes&quot; in French) is also mentioned, in 1690, in Antoine Furetière&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire universel&quot;, under the article &quot;Tablette&quot;: &quot;&quot;. (&quot;We have seen consommés reduced into tablets, or broth to carry in your pocket&quot;.)

===Mrs Dubois===
As a mass-produced product, portable soup is generally held to have been invented by Mrs Dubois, a London tavern keeper who, with William Cookworthy, won a contract to manufacture it for the Royal Navy in 1756. Mrs Dubois was described as &quot;a person of good character and circumstances&quot;. She operated from a tavern, at the Golden Head, in Three Kings Court in Fleet Street. She may have been the widow of a French chef and tavern keeper; but, by 1757, she had a new husband, Edward Bennet, son of a Sheffield knife-grinder. The contract with the navy was alluded to in advertising material long after it had lapsed, Benjamin Piper, successor in the business announced he was &quot;Successor to Messieurs Bennet and Dubois, The original Portable Soup-Makers to His majesty’s Royal Navy&quot; and one Vigor, successor to Piper, used the same rubric on his flyers. The naval authorities hoped that portable soup would prevent scurvy among their crews. They therefore allotted a daily ration to each sailor beginning in the 1750s. Captain Cook was convinced of its efficacy and carried it on both his South Seas voyages.

Lewis and Clark carried portable soup on their 1804–1806 expedition into the territory of the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase. According to his letter from Fredericktown, Ohio, on 15 April 1803, Lewis purchased the soup from Francois Baillet, a cook in Philadelphia. He paid $289.50 for the 193 pounds of portable soup stored in &quot;32 canisters&quot;. Lewis carried it with him overland to the embarkation point on the Ohio River.

===Decline===
By 1815, with the publication of physician Gilbert Blane&#x27;s &quot;On the Comparative Health of the British Navy from 1779 to 1814&quot;, the efficacy of portable soup for promoting the health of sailors was found lacking. Opinion shifted in favour of canned meats, a process invented in France in 1806, and the proliferation of meat extract, invented by Justus von Liebig. 

A similar product, portable gelatin, was developed by American inventor Peter Cooper in 1845, as a staple meal or dessert for families.

Nevertheless, as late as 1881 portable soup was still being described by the &quot;Household Cyclopedia&quot; as:

* In Johann David Wyss&#x27;s novel &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot; (1812), set in the 1790s, portable soup makes a number of appearances. The youngest son, Franz, first mistakes it for glue, and then later suggests it be used as a substitute.
* The Aubrey–Maturin series by Patrick O&#x27;Brian, set on the high seas during the Napoleonic Wars, is replete with references to portable soup.

<text>Asparagus (Asparagus officinalis) is a perennial flowering plant species in the genus &quot;Asparagus&quot; native to Eurasia. Widely cultivated as a vegetable crop, its young shoots are used as a spring vegetable.

== Description ==

Asparagus is an herbaceous, perennial plant growing to tall, with stout stems with much-branched, feathery foliage. The &#x27;leaves&#x27; are needle-like cladodes (modified stems) in the axils of scale leaves; they are long and broad, and clustered in fours, up to 15, together, in a rose-like shape. The root system, often referred to as a &#x27;crown&#x27;, is adventitious; the root type is fasciculated. The flowers are bell-shaped, greenish-white to yellowish, long, with six tepals partially fused together at the base; they are produced singly or in clusters of two or three in the junctions of the branchlets. It is usually dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate plants, but sometimes hermaphrodite flowers are found. The fruit is a small red berry in diameter, which is toxic to humans.

Plants native to the western coasts of Europe (from northern Spain to northwest Germany, north Ireland, and Great Britain) are treated as &quot;A. officinalis&quot; subsp. &quot;prostratus&quot; , distinguished by its low-growing, often prostrate stems growing to only high, and shorter cladodes long. Some authors treat it as a distinct species, &quot;A. prostratus&quot; .

== Taxonomy ==
Asparagus was once classified in the lily family, as were the related &quot;Allium&quot; species onions and garlic. Genetic research currently places lilies, &quot;Allium&quot;, and asparagus in three separate families: the Liliaceae, Amaryllidaceae, and Asparagaceae, respectively. The latter two are part of the order Asparagales.

=== Etymology ===
The English word &quot;asparagus&quot; derives from classical Latin but the plant was once known in English as &quot;sperage&quot;, from the Medieval Latin &quot;sparagus&quot;. This term itself derives from the - &quot;aspáragos&quot;, a variant of - &quot;aspháragos&quot;. The Greek terms are of uncertain provenance; the former form admits the possibility of a Proto-Indo-European root meaning &quot;to jerk, scatter,&quot; directly or via a Persian descendant meaning &quot;twig, branch&quot;; but the Ancient Greek word itself, meaning &quot;gully, chasm,&quot; seems to be of Pre-Greek origin instead.

In English, &quot;A. officinalis&quot; is widely known simply as &quot;asparagus&quot;, or sometimes &quot;garden asparagus&quot;.

Asparagus was corrupted by folk etymology in some places to &quot;sparrow grass&quot;; indeed, John Walker wrote in 1791 that &quot;&quot;Sparrowgrass&quot; is so general that &quot;asparagus&quot; has an air of stiffness and pedantry&quot;.
The name &#x27;sparrow grass&#x27; was still in common use in rural East Anglia, England well into the twentieth century.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Sources differ as to the plant&#x27;s native range, but generally include most of Europe and western temperate Asia. 

== Cultivation ==
Since asparagus often originates in maritime habitats, it thrives in soils that are too saline for normal weeds to grow. Thus, a little salt was traditionally used to suppress weeds in beds intended for asparagus; this has the disadvantage that the soil cannot be used for anything else. Some regions and gardening zones are better-suited for growing asparagus than others, such as the west coast of North America and other more maritime, “Mediterranean” environments. The fertility of the soil is a large factor. &quot;Crowns&quot; are planted in winter, and the first shoots appear in spring; the first pickings or &quot;thinnings&quot; are known as sprue asparagus. Sprue has thin stems.

A breed of &quot;early-season asparagus&quot; that can be harvested two months earlier than usual was announced by a UK grower in early 2011. This variety does not need to lie dormant and blooms at , rather than the usual .
Purple asparagus differs from its green and white counterparts in having high sugar and low fibre levels. Purple asparagus was originally developed in Italy, near the city of Albenga and commercialized under the variety name &#x27;Violetto d&#x27; Albenga&#x27;. Purple asparagus can also turn green while being cooked due to its sensitivity to heat.

=== Companion planting ===
Asparagus is said to be a useful companion plant for tomatoes, as the tomato plant repels the asparagus beetle. Asparagus may repel some harmful root nematodes that affect tomato plants.

== Uses ==
The genome of the species has been sequenced as a model to study the evolution of sex chromosomes in plants and dioecy.

=== Nutrition ===
Water makes up 93% of asparagus&#x27;s composition. Asparagus is low in food energy and very low in sodium. It is a good source of vitamin B6, calcium, magnesium, and zinc, and a very good source of dietary fibre, protein, beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, rutin, niacin, folic acid, iron, phosphorus, potassium, copper, manganese, and selenium, as well as chromium, a trace mineral that regulates the ability of insulin to transport glucose from the bloodstream into cells. The amino acid asparagine gets its name from asparagus, from which it was first isolated, as the asparagus plant is relatively rich in this compound.

=== Culinary ===
Only young asparagus shoots are commonly eaten: once the buds start to open (&quot;ferning out&quot;), the shoots quickly turn woody. The roots contain starch.

The shoots are prepared and served in a number of ways around the world, typically as an appetizer or vegetable side dish. In Asian-style cooking, asparagus is often stir-fried. Cantonese restaurants in the United States often serve asparagus stir-fried with chicken, shrimp, or beef. It may also be quickly grilled over charcoal or hardwood embers, and is also used as an ingredient in some stews and soups. 

Asparagus can also be pickled and stored for several years. Some brands label shoots prepared in this way as &quot;marinated&quot;.

Stem thickness indicates the age of the plant (and not the age of the stalk), with the thicker stems coming from older plants. Older, thicker stalks can be woody, although peeling the skin at the base removes the tough layer. Peeled asparagus will poach much faster. The bottom portion of asparagus often contains sand and soil, so thorough cleaning is generally advised before cooking. 
Male plants tend to produce spears that are smaller and thinner, while female plants tend produce larger and thicker spears. Thickness and thinness are not an indication of tenderness or toughness. The stalks are thick or thin from the moment they sprout from the ground.

Green asparagus is eaten worldwide, and the availability of imports throughout the year has made it less of a delicacy than it once was. In Europe, according to one source, the &quot;asparagus season is a highlight of the foodie calendar&quot;; in the UK this traditionally begins on 23 April and ends on Midsummer Day. As in continental Europe, due to the short growing season and demand for local produce, asparagus commands a premium price.

=== Commercial production ===
The top asparagus importers (2016) were the United States (214,735 tonnes), followed by Germany (24,484 tonnes), and Canada (19,224 tonnes).

China is by far the world&#x27;s largest producer: in 2017 it produced 7,845,162 tonnes, followed by Peru with 383,098 tonnes and Mexico with 245,681 tonnes. U.S. production was concentrated in California, Michigan, and Washington.
The annual production for white asparagus in Germany is 57,000 tonnes (61% of consumer demand).

When grown under tunnels, growers can extend the harvest season. In the UK, it is estimated that the asparagus harvest season can begin as early as mid-February and continue into late autumn by growing cold-resistant cultivars under heated polytunnels. Furthermore, late season harvests can be achieved using &#x27;reverse season growth&#x27; where spears are left to fern between March–August and harvested in September–October.

In Asia, an alternative approach to cultivating asparagus has been employed and is referred to as &#x27;Mother Stalk Method&#x27; where three to five stalks per plant are allowed to develop into fern, while harvesting adjacent spears.

=== White asparagus ===
White asparagus is very popular in Europe and western Asia. White asparagus is the result of applying a blanching technique while the asparagus shoots are growing. To cultivate white asparagus, the shoots are covered with soil as they grow, i.e. earthed up; without exposure to sunlight, no photosynthesis starts, and the shoots remain white. Compared to green asparagus, the locally cultivated so-called &quot;white gold&quot; or &quot;edible ivory&quot; asparagus, also referred to as &quot;the royal vegetable&quot;, is believed to be less bitter and much more tender. Freshness is very important, and the lower ends of white asparagus must be peeled before cooking or raw consumption.

Only seasonally on the menu, asparagus dishes are advertised outside many restaurants, usually from late April to June. For the French style, asparagus is often boiled or steamed and served with Hollandaise sauce, white sauce, melted butter or most recently with olive oil and Parmesan cheese. Tall, narrow asparagus cooking pots allow the shoots to be steamed gently, their tips staying out of the water.

During the German &quot;Spargelsaison&quot; or &quot;Spargelzeit&quot; (&quot;asparagus season&quot; or &quot;asparagus time&quot;), the asparagus season that traditionally finishes on 24 June, roadside stands and open-air markets sell about half of the country&#x27;s white asparagus consumption.

In western Himalayan regions, such as Nepal and north-western India, wild asparagus is harvested as a seasonal vegetable delicacy known as kurilo or jhijhirkani.

== In culture ==
Asparagus has been used as a vegetable owing to its distinct flavor, and in medicine due to its diuretic properties and its purported function as an aphrodisiac. It is pictured as an offering on an Egyptian frieze dating to 3000 BC. In ancient times, it was also known in Syria and in the Iberian Peninsula. Greeks and Romans ate it fresh when in season, and dried the vegetable for use in winter. Emperor Augustus coined the expression &quot;faster than cooking asparagus&quot; for quick action.

A recipe for cooking asparagus is given in one of the oldest surviving collections of recipes (Apicius&#x27;s 1st century AD &quot;De re coquinaria&quot;, Book III). In the second century AD, the Greek physician Galen, highly respected within Roman society, mentioned asparagus as a beneficial herb, but as dominance of the Roman empire waned, asparagus&#x27; medicinal value drew little attention
until al-Nafzawi&#x27;s &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot;. That piece of writing celebrates its purported aphrodisiacal power that the Indian &quot;Ananga Ranga&quot; attributes to &quot;special phosphorus elements&quot; that also counteract fatigue.

By 1469, asparagus was cultivated in French monasteries. Asparagus appears to have been little noticed in England until 1538, and in Germany until 1542.

Asparagus was brought to North America by European settlers at least as early as 1655. Adriaen van der Donck, a Dutch immigrant to New Netherland, mentions asparagus in his description of Dutch farming practices in the New World. Asparagus was grown by British immigrants as well; in 1685, one of William Penn&#x27;s advertisements for Pennsylvania included asparagus in a long list of crops that grew well in the American climate.

The &quot;points d&#x27;amour&quot; (&quot;love tips&quot;) were served as a delicacy to Madame de Pompadour (1721–1764).
=== Effects on urine ===
The effect of eating asparagus on urine excreted afterwards has long been observed:

[Asparagus] cause a powerful and disagreeable smell in the urine, as everybody knows.
:— &quot;Treatise of All Sorts of Foods&quot;, Louis Lémery, 1702

asparagus... affects the urine with a smell (especially if cut when they are white) and therefore have been suspected by some physicians as not friendly to the kidneys; when they are older, and begin to ramify, they lose this quality; but then they are not so agreeable.
:— &quot;An Essay Concerning the Nature of Aliments&quot;, John Arbuthnot, 1735

A few Stems of Asparagus eaten, shall give our Urine a disagreeable Odour...
:— &quot;Letter to the Royal Academy of Brussels&quot;, Benjamin Franklin, c. 1781

Asparagus &quot;...transforms my chamber-pot into a flask of perfume.&quot;
:— Marcel Proust (1871–1922)

Asparagus contains asparagusic acid. When the vegetable is digested, a group of volatile sulfur-containing compounds is produced.

Certain compounds in asparagus are metabolized to yield ammonia and various sulfur-containing degradation products, including various thiols and thioesters, which following consumption give urine a characteristic smell. Some of the volatile organic compounds responsible for the smell are:
* methanethiol
* dimethyl sulfide
* dimethyl disulfide
* bis(methylthio)methane
* dimethyl sulfoxide
* dimethyl sulfone

Subjectively, the first two are the most pungent, while the last two (sulfur-oxidized) give a sweet aroma. A mixture of these compounds form a &quot;reconstituted asparagus urine&quot; odor. This was first investigated in 1891 by Marceli Nencki, who attributed the smell to methanethiol. These compounds originate in the asparagus as asparagusic acid and its derivatives, as these are the only sulfur-containing compounds unique to asparagus. As these are more present in young asparagus, this accords with the observation that the smell is more pronounced after eating young asparagus. The biological mechanism for the production of these compounds is less clear.

The onset of the asparagus urine smell is remarkably rapid while the decline is slower. The smell has been reported to be detectable 15 to 30 minutes after ingestion and subsides with a half-life of approximately four hours.
Asparagus has been eaten and cultivated for at least two millennia but the association between odorous urine and asparagus consumption was not observed until the late 17th century when sulfur-rich fertilisers became common in agriculture. Small-scale studies noted that the &quot;asparagus urine&quot; odour was not produced by all individuals and estimates as to the proportion of the population who are excretors (reporting a noticeable asparagus urine odour after eating asparagus) has ranged from about 40% to as high as 79%. When excretors are exposed to non-excretor urine after asparagus consumption, however, the characteristic asparagus urine odour is usually reported. More recent work has confirmed that a small proportion of individuals do not produce asparagus urine, and amongst those that do, some cannot detect the odour due to a single-nucleotide polymorphism within a cluster of olfactory receptors.

Debate exists about the universality of producing the sulfurous smell, as well as the ability to detect it. Originally, this was thought to be because some people digested asparagus differently from others, so some excreted odorous urine after eating asparagus, and others did not. In the 1980s, three studies from France, China, and Israel published results showing that producing odorous urine from asparagus was a common human characteristic. The Israeli study found that from their 307 subjects, all of those who could smell &quot;asparagus urine&quot; could detect it in the urine of anyone who had eaten asparagus, even if the person who produced it could not detect it. A 2010 study found variations in both production of odorous urine and the ability to detect the odor, but that these were not tightly related. Most people are thought to produce the odorous compounds after eating asparagus, but the differing abilities of various individuals to detect the odor at increasing dilutions suggests a genetically determined specific sensitivity.

In 2010, the company 23andMe published a genome-wide association study on whether participants have &quot;ever noticed a peculiar odor when [they] pee after eating asparagus&quot;. This study pinpointed a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in a cluster of olfactory genes associated with the ability to detect the odor. While this SNP did not explain all of the difference in detection between people, it provides support for the theory that genetic differences occur in olfactory receptors that lead people to be unable to smell these odorous compounds.

=== Celebrations ===
The green crop is significant enough in California&#x27;s Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta region that the city of Stockton holds a festival every year to celebrate it. Oceana County, Michigan, the self-proclaimed &quot;asparagus capital of the world&quot; hosts an annual festival complete with a parade and asparagus queen; The Vale of Evesham in Worcestershire is the largest producer within Northern Europe, celebrating with the annual British Asparagus Festival involving auctions of the best crop, an &quot;Asparagus Run&quot; modelled on the Beaujolais Run and a weekend &quot;Asparafest&quot; music festival.

Many German cities hold an annual &quot;Spargelfest&quot; (asparagus festival) celebrating the harvest of white asparagus. Schwetzingen claims to be the &quot;Asparagus Capital of the World&quot;, and during its festival, an Asparagus Queen is crowned. The Bavarian city of Nuremberg feasts a week long in April, with a competition to find the fastest asparagus peeler in the region; this usually involves generous amounts of the local wines and beers being consumed to aid the spectators&#x27; appreciative support.
Helmut Zipner, who peeled a ton of asparagus in 16 hours, holds the world record in asparagus peeling.

<text>A flatfish is a member of the ray-finned demersal fish superorder Pleuronectoidei, also called the Heterosomata. In many species, both eyes lie on one side of the head, one or the other migrating through or around the head during development. Some species face their left sides upward, some face their right sides upward, and others face either side upward. The most primitive members of the group, the threadfins, do not resemble the flatfish but are their closest relatives.

Many important food fish are in this order, including the flounders, soles, turbot, plaice, and halibut. Some flatfish can camouflage themselves on the ocean floor.

==Taxonomy==
Due to their highly distinctive morphology, flatfishes were previously treated as belonging to their own order, Pleuronectiformes. However, more recent taxonomic studies have found them to group within a diverse group of nektonic marine fishes known as the Carangiformes, which also includes jacks and billfish. Specifically, flatfish are most closely related to the threadfins, which are now also placed in the suborder Pleuronectoidei. Together, the group is most closely related to the archerfish and beachsalmons within Toxotoidei. Due to this, they are now treated as a suborder of the Carangiformes.

Over 800 described species are placed into 16 families. When they were treated as an order, the flatfishes are divided into two suborders, Psettodoidei and Pleuronectoidei, with &gt; 99% of the species diversity found within the Pleuronectoidei. The largest families are Soleidae, Bothidae and Cynoglossidae with more than 150 species each. There also exist two monotypic families (Paralichthodidae and Oncopteridae). Some families are the results of relatively recent splits. For example, the Achiridae were classified as a subfamily of Soleidae in the past, and the Samaridae were considered a subfamily of the Pleuronectidae. The families Paralichthodidae, Poecilopsettidae, and Rhombosoleidae were also traditionally treated as subfamilies of Pleuronectidae, but are now recognised as families in their own right. The Paralichthyidae has long been indicated to be paraphyletic, with the formal description of Cyclopsettidae in 2019 resulting in the split of this family as well.

The taxonomy of some groups is in need of a review. The last monograph covering the entire order was John Roxborough Norman&#x27;s &quot;Monograph of the Flatfishes&quot; published in 1934. In particular, &quot;Tephrinectes sinensis&quot; may represent a family-level lineage and requires further evaluation e.g. New species are described with some regularity and undescribed species likely remain.

===Hybrids===
Hybrids are well known in flatfishes. The Pleuronectidae have the largest number of reported hybrids of marine fishes. Two of the most famous intergeneric hybrids are between the European plaice (&quot;Pleuronectes platessa&quot;) and European flounder (&quot;Platichthys flesus&quot;) in the Baltic Sea, and between the English sole (&quot;Parophrys vetulus&quot;) and starry flounder (&quot;Platichthys stellatus&quot;) in Puget Sound. The offspring of the latter species pair is popularly known as the hybrid sole and was initially believed to be a valid species in its own right.

==Distribution==
Flatfishes are found in oceans worldwide, ranging from the Arctic, through the tropics, to Antarctica. Species diversity is centered in the Indo-West Pacific and declines following both latitudinal and longitudinal gradients away from the Indo-West Pacific. Most species are found in depths between 0 and , but a few have been recorded from depths in excess of . None have been confirmed from the abyssal or hadal zones. An observation of a flatfish from the Bathyscaphe Trieste at the bottom of the Mariana Trench at a depth of almost has been questioned by fish experts, and recent authorities do not recognize it as valid. Among the deepwater species, &quot;Symphurus thermophilus&quot; lives congregating around &quot;ponds&quot; of sulphur at hydrothermal vents on the seafloor. No other flatfish is known from hydrothermal vents. Many species will enter brackish or fresh water, and a smaller number of soles (families Achiridae and Soleidae) and tonguefish (Cynoglossidae) are entirely restricted to fresh water.

==Characteristics==
The most obvious characteristic of the flatfish is its asymmetry, with both eyes lying on the same side of the head in the adult fish. In some families, the eyes are usually on the right side of the body (dextral or right-eyed flatfish), and in others, they are usually on the left (sinistral or left-eyed flatfish). The primitive spiny turbots include equal numbers of right- and left-sided individuals, and are generally less asymmetrical than the other families. Other distinguishing features of the order are the presence of protrusible eyes, another adaptation to living on the seabed (benthos), and the extension of the dorsal fin onto the head.

The most basal members of the group, the threadfins, do not closely resemble the flatfishes.

The surface of the fish facing away from the sea floor is pigmented, often serving to camouflage the fish, but sometimes with striking coloured patterns. Some flatfishes are also able to change their pigmentation to match the background, in a manner similar to some cephalopods. The side of the body without the eyes, facing the seabed, is usually colourless or very pale.

In general, flatfishes rely on their camouflage for avoiding predators, but some have aposematic traits such as conspicuous eyespots (e.g., &quot;Microchirus ocellatus&quot;) and several small tropical species (at least &quot;Aseraggodes&quot;, &quot;Pardachirus&quot; and &quot;Zebrias&quot;) are poisonous. Juveniles of &quot;Soleichthys maculosus&quot; mimic toxic flatworms of the genus &quot;Pseudobiceros&quot; in both colours and swimming mode. Conversely, a few octopus species have been reported to mimic flatfishes in colours, shape and swimming mode.

The flounders and spiny turbots eat smaller fish, and have well-developed teeth. They sometimes seek prey in the midwater, away from the bottom, and show fewer extreme adaptations than other families. The soles, by contrast, are almost exclusively bottom-dwellers, and feed on invertebrates. They show a more extreme asymmetry, and may lack teeth on one side of the jaw.

Flatfishes range in size from &quot;Tarphops oligolepis&quot;, measuring about in length, and weighing , to the Atlantic halibut, at and .

==Reproduction==
Flatfishes lay eggs that hatch into larvae resembling typical, symmetrical, fish. These are initially elongated, but quickly develop into a more rounded form. The larvae typically have protective spines on the head, over the gills, and in the pelvic and pectoral fins. They also possess a swim bladder, and do not dwell on the bottom, instead dispersing from their hatching grounds as plankton.

The length of the planktonic stage varies between different types of flatfishes, but eventually they begin to metamorphose into the adult form. One of the eyes migrates across the top of the head and onto the other side of the body, leaving the fish blind on one side. The larva also loses its swim bladder and spines, and sinks to the bottom, laying its blind side on the underlying surface.

==Origin and evolution==
Scientists have been proposing since the 1910s that flatfishes evolved from percoid ancestors. There has been some disagreement whether they are a monophyletic group. Some palaeontologists think that some percomorph groups other than flatfishes were &quot;experimenting&quot; with head asymmetry during the Eocene, and certain molecular studies conclude that the primitive family of Psettodidae evolved their flat bodies and asymmetrical head independently of other flatfish groups. Many scientists, however, argue that pleuronectiformes are monophyletic. 

The fossil record indicates that flatfishes might have been present before the Eocene, based on fossil otoliths resembling those of modern pleuronectiforms dating back to the Thanetian and Ypresian stages (57-53 million years ago).

Flatfishes have been cited as dramatic examples of evolutionary adaptation. Richard Dawkins, in &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot;, explains the flatfishes&#x27; evolutionary history thus:

...bony fish as a rule have a marked tendency to be flattened in a vertical direction... It was natural, therefore, that when the ancestors of [flatfish] took to the sea bottom, they should have lain on one &quot;side&quot;... But this raised the problem that one eye was always looking down into the sand and was effectively useless. In evolution this problem was solved by the lower eye &#x27;moving&#x27; round to the upper side.
The origin of the unusual morphology of flatfishes was enigmatic up to the 2000s, and early researchers suggested that it came about as a result of saltation rather than gradual evolution through natural selection, because a partially migrated eye were considered to have been maladaptive. This started to change in 2008 with a study on the two fossil genera &quot;Amphistium&quot; and &quot;Heteronectes&quot;, dated to about 50 million years ago. These genera retain primitive features not seen in modern types of flatfishes. In addition, their heads are less asymmetric than modern flatfishes, retaining one eye on each side of their heads, although the eye on one side is closer to the top of the head than on the other. The more recently described fossil genera &quot;Quasinectes&quot; and &quot;Anorevus&quot; have been proposed to show similar morphologies and have also been classified as &quot;stem pleuronectiforms&quot;. Suchs findings lead Friedman to conclude that the evolution of flatfish morphology &quot;happened gradually, in a way consistent with evolution via natural selection—not suddenly, as researchers once had little choice but to believe.&quot; 

To explain the survival advantage of a partially migrated eye, it has been proposed that primitive flatfishes like &quot;Amphistium&quot; rested with the head propped up above the seafloor (a behaviour sometimes observed in modern flatfishes), enabling them to use their partially migrated eye to see things closer to the seafloor.

While known basal genera like &quot;Amphistium&quot; and &quot;Heteronectes&quot; support a gradual acquisition of the flatfish morphology, they were probably not direct ancestors to living pleuronectiforms, as fossil evidence indicate that most flatfish lineages living today were present in the Eocene and contemporaneous with them. It has been suggested that the more primitive forms were eventually outcompeted.

==As food==
Flatfish is considered a Whitefish because of the high concentration of oils within its liver. Its lean flesh makes for a unique flavor that differs from species to species. Methods of cooking include grilling, pan-frying, baking and deep-frying.

<text>A flat tax (short for flat-rate tax) is a tax with a single rate on the taxable amount, after accounting for any deductions or exemptions from the tax base. It is not necessarily a fully proportional tax. Implementations are often progressive due to exemptions, or regressive in case of a maximum taxable amount. There are various tax systems that are labeled &quot;flat tax&quot; even though they are significantly different. The defining characteristic is the existence of only one tax rate other than zero, as opposed to multiple non-zero rates that vary depending on the amount subject to taxation.

A flat tax system is usually discussed in the context of an income tax, where progressivity is common, but it may also apply to taxes on consumption, property or transfers.

== Major categories ==
Flat tax proposals differ in how the subject of the tax is defined.

=== True flat-rate income tax ===
A true flat-rate tax is a system of taxation where one tax rate is applied to all personal income with no deductions.

=== Marginal flat tax ===
Where deductions are allowed, a &#x27;flat tax&#x27; is a progressive tax with the special characteristic that, above the maximum deduction, the marginal rate on all further income is constant. Such a tax is said to be marginally flat above that point. The difference between a true flat tax and a marginally flat tax can be reconciled by recognizing that the latter simply excludes certain types of income from being defined as taxable income; hence, both kinds of tax are flat on taxable income.

=== Flat tax with limited deductions ===
Modified flat taxes have been proposed which would allow deductions for a very few items, while still eliminating the vast majority of existing deductions. Charitable deductions and home mortgage interest are the most discussed examples of deductions that would be retained, as these deductions are popular with voters and are often used. Another common theme is a single, large, fixed deduction. This large fixed deduction would compensate for the elimination of various existing deductions and would simplify taxes, having the side-effect that many (mostly low income) households will not have to file tax returns.

=== Hall–Rabushka flat tax ===

Designed by economists at the Hoover Institution, Hall–Rabushka is a flat tax on consumption. Principally, Hall–Rabushka accomplishes a consumption tax effect by taxing income and then excluding investment. Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka have consulted extensively in designing the flat tax systems in Eastern Europe.

=== Negative income tax ===

The negative income tax (NIT), which Milton Friedman proposed in his 1962 book &quot;Capitalism and Freedom&quot;, is a type of flat tax. The basic idea is the same as a flat tax with personal deductions, except that when deductions exceed income, the taxable income is allowed to become negative rather than being set to zero. The flat tax rate is then applied to the resulting &quot;negative income,&quot; resulting in a &quot;negative income tax&quot; that the government would owe to the household—unlike the usual &quot;positive&quot; income tax, which the household owes the government.

For example, let the flat rate be 20%, and let the deductions be $20,000 per adult and $7,000 per dependent. Under such a system, a family of four making $54,000 a year would owe no tax. A family of four making $74,000 a year would owe tax amounting to 0.20 × (74,000 − 54,000) = $4,000, as would be the case under a flat tax system with deductions. Families of four earning less than $54,000 per year, however, would experience a &quot;negative&quot; amount of tax (that is, the family would receive money from the government instead of paying to the government). For example, if the family earned $34,000 a year, it would receive a check for $4,000. The NIT is intended to replace not just the USA&#x27;s income tax, but also many benefits low income American households receive, such as food stamps and Medicaid. The NIT is designed to avoid the welfare trap—effective high marginal tax rates arising from the rules reducing benefits as market income rises. An objection to the NIT is that it is welfare without a work requirement. Those who would owe negative tax would be receiving a form of welfare without having to make an effort to obtain employment. Another objection is that the NIT subsidizes industries employing low-cost labor, but this objection can also be made against current systems of benefits for the working poor.

=== Capped flat tax ===
A capped flat tax is one in which income is taxed at a flat rate until a specified cap amount is reached. For example, the United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax is 6.2% of gross compensation up to a limit (in 2025, up to $176,100 of earnings, for a maximum tax of $10,918.20). This cap has the effect of turning a nominally flat tax into a regressive tax.

== Requirements for a fully defined schema ==
In devising a flat tax system, several recurring issues must be enumerated, principally with deductions and the identification of when money is earned.

=== Defining when income occurs ===
Since a central tenet of the flat tax is to minimize the compartmentalization of incomes into myriad special or sheltered cases, a vexing problem is deciding when income occurs. This is demonstrated by the taxation of interest income and stock dividends. The shareholders own the company and so the company&#x27;s profits belong to them. If a company is taxed on its profits, then the funds paid out as dividends have already been taxed. It&#x27;s a debatable question if they should subsequently be treated as income to the shareholders and thus subject to further tax. A similar issue arises in deciding if interest paid on loans should be deductible from the taxable income since that interest is in-turn taxed as income to the loan provider. There is no universally agreed answer to what is fair. For example, in the United States, dividends are not deductible but mortgage interest is deductible. &quot;Thus a Flat Tax proposal is not fully defined until it differentiates new untaxed income from a pass-through of already taxed income.&quot;

=== Policy administration ===
Taxes, in addition to providing revenue, can be potent instruments of policy. For example, it is common for governments to encourage social policy such as home insulation or low income housing with tax credits rather than constituting a ministry to implement these policies. In a flat tax system with limited deductions such policy administration, mechanisms are curtailed. In addition to social policy, flat taxes can remove tools for adjusting economic policy as well. For example, in the United States, short-term capital gains are taxed at a higher rate than long-term gains as means to promote long-term investment horizons and damp speculative fluctuation. &quot;Thus, if one assumes that government should be active in policy decisions such as this, then claims that flat taxes are cheaper/simpler to administer than others are incomplete until they factor in costs for alternative policy administration.&quot;

=== Minimizing deductions ===
In general, the question of how to eliminate deductions is fundamental to the flat tax design; deductions dramatically affect the effective &quot;flatness&quot; in the tax rate. Perhaps the single biggest necessary deduction is for business expenses. If businesses were not allowed to deduct expenses, businesses with a profit margin below the flat tax rate could never earn any money since the tax on revenues would always exceed the earnings. For example, grocery stores typically earn pennies on every dollar of revenue; they could not pay a tax rate of 25% on revenues unless their markup exceeded 25%. Thus, corporations must be able to deduct operating expenses even if individuals cannot. A practical dilemma arises as to identifying what is an expense for a business. For example, if a peanut butter producer purchases a jar manufacturer, is that an expense (since the producer has to purchase jars somehow) or a sheltering of income through investment? Flat tax systems can differ greatly in how they accommodate such gray areas. For example, the &quot;9-9-9&quot; flat tax proposal would allow businesses to deduct purchases but not labor costs, which effectively taxes labor-intensive industrial revenue at a higher rate. How deductions are implemented will dramatically change the effective total tax, and thus the flatness of the tax. &quot;Thus, a flat tax proposal is not fully defined unless the proposal includes a differentiation between deductible and non-deductible expenses.&quot;

== Tax effects ==

=== Diminishing marginal utility ===
Flat tax benefits higher income brackets progressively due to decline in marginal value. If a flat tax system has a large exemption, it is effectively a progressive tax. As a result, the term &quot;flat tax&quot; is actually a shorthand for the more proper marginally flat tax.

=== Administration and enforcement ===
One type of flat tax would be imposed on all income once: at the source of the income. Hall and Rabushka proposed an amendment to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code that would implement the variant of the flat tax they advocate. This amendment, only a few pages long, would replace hundreds of pages of statutory language (although most statutory language in taxation statutes is &quot;not&quot; directed at specifying graduated tax rates).

As it now stands, the U.S. Internal Revenue Code is over several million words long, and contains many loopholes, deductions, and exemptions which, advocates of flat taxes claim, render the collection of taxes and the enforcement of tax law complicated and inefficient.

It is further argued that current tax law slows economic growth by distorting economic incentives, and by allowing, even encouraging, tax avoidance. With a flat tax, there are fewer incentives than in the current system to create tax shelters, and to engage in other forms of tax avoidance.

Flat tax critics contend that a flat tax system could be created with many loopholes, or a progressive tax system without loopholes, and that a progressive tax system could be as simple, or simpler, than a flat tax system. A simple progressive tax would also discourage tax avoidance.

Under a pure flat tax without deductions, every tax period a company would make a single payment to the government covering the taxes on the employees and the taxes on the company profit. For example, suppose that in a given year, a company called ACME earns a profit of 3 million, spends 2 million in wages, and spends 1 million on other expenses that under the tax law is taxable income to recipients, such as the receipt of stock options, bonuses, and certain executive privileges. Given a flat rate of 15%, ACME would then owe the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (3M + 2M + 1M) × 0.15 = 900,000. This payment would, in one fell swoop, settle the tax liabilities of ACME&#x27;s employees as well as the corporate taxes owed by ACME. Most employees throughout the economy would never need to interact with the IRS, as all tax owed on wages, interest, dividends, royalties, etc. would be withheld at the source. The main exceptions would be employees with incomes from personal ventures. The &quot;Economist&quot; claims that such a system would reduce the number of entities required to file returns from about 130 million individuals, households, and businesses, as at present, to a mere 8 million businesses and self-employed.

However, this simplicity depends on the absence of deductions of any kind being allowed (or at least no variability in the deductions of different people). Furthermore, if income of differing types are segregated (e.g., pass-through, long term cap gains, regular income, etc.) then complications ensue. For example, if realized capital gains were subject to the flat tax, the law would require brokers and mutual funds to calculate the realized capital gain on all sales and redemption. If there were a gain, a tax equal to 15% of the amount of the gain would be withheld and sent to the IRS. If there were a loss, the amount would be reported to the IRS. The loss would offset gains, and then the IRS would settle up with taxpayers at the end of the period. Lacking deductions, this scheme cannot be used to implement economic and social policy indirectly by tax credits and thus, as noted above, the simplifications to the government&#x27;s revenue collection apparatus might be offset by new government ministries required to administer those policies.

=== Revenues ===
Russia was considered a prime case of the success of a flat tax; the real revenues from its personal income tax rose by 25.2% in the first year after the country introduced a flat tax in 2001, followed by a 24.6% increase in the second year, and a 15.2% increase in the third year.

The Russian example is often used as proof of the validity of this analysis, despite an International Monetary Fund study in 2006 which found that there was no sign &quot;of Laffer-type behavioral responses generating revenue increases from the tax cut elements of these reforms&quot; in Russia or in other countries.

In 2021, Russia ended its flat tax on personal income as it introduced a second higher tax rate.

Bulgaria&#x27;s entry into the EU in 2007 was marked by a spur of reforms aimed at reducing the large share of informal economic activity, estimated at 43% in 2006. Parliament approved the introduction of a 10% corporate income tax rate for 2007, to be followed by a 10% personal income tax rate the next year. The IMF was wary of this reform, arguing that the simplified tax system would lower the budget surplus and encourage a larger current account deficit. At the time of these discussions, however, the Bulgarian government did not need external financing and proceeded with its reform plans. The year 2007 brought a huge growth of revenue from corporate income tax (by 39% compared with the previous year) and surpassed the Ministry of Finance&#x27;s own forecast (27% year on year). The budget surplus rose despite considerable emergency spending at the end of the year. There were several reasons for this beneficial effect: (i) the tax rate limited the incentives for tax evasion, (ii) the optimism at the beginning of the country&#x27;s EU membership, (iii) and the increase in foreign direct investment, which reached an all-time annual record of €9 billion (about 11% of GDP).

=== Overall structure ===
Taxes other than the income tax (for example, taxes on sales and payrolls) tend to be regressive. Under such a structure, those with lower incomes tend to pay a &quot;higher&quot; proportion of their income in total taxes than the affluent do. The fraction of household income that is a return to capital (dividends, interest, royalties, profits of unincorporated businesses) is positively correlated with total household income. Hence a flat tax limited to wages would seem to leave the wealthy better off. Modifying the tax base can change the effects. A flat tax could be targeted at income (rather than wages), which could place the tax burden equally on all earners, including those who earn income primarily from returns on investment. Tax systems could utilize a flat sales tax to target all consumption, which can be modified with rebates or exemptions to remove regressive effects, such as the proposed FairTax in the United States.

=== Border adjustable ===
A flat tax system and income taxes overall are not inherently border-adjustable; meaning the tax component embedded into products via taxes imposed on companies (including corporate taxes and payroll taxes) are not removed when exported to a foreign country &quot;(see Effect of taxes and subsidies on price)&quot;. Taxation systems such as a sales tax or value added tax can remove the tax component when goods are exported and apply the tax component on imports. The domestic products could be at a disadvantage to foreign products (at home and abroad) that are border-adjustable, which would affect the global competitiveness of a country. However, it&#x27;s possible that a flat tax system could be combined with tariffs and credits to act as border adjustments (the proposed &quot;Border Tax Equity Act&quot; in the United States attempts this). Implementing an income tax with a border adjustment tax credit is a violation of the World Trade Organization agreement. Tax exemptions (allowances) on low income wages, a component of most income tax systems could mitigate this issue for high labour content industries like textiles that compete Globally.

In a subsequent section, various proposals for flat tax-like schemes are discussed, these differ mainly on how they approach with the following issues of deductions, defining income, and policy implementation.

== Around the world ==

Most countries tax personal income at the national level using progressive rates, but some use a flat rate. The vast majority of countries that have or had a flat tax on personal income at the national level are former communist countries or islands.

In some countries, subdivisions are allowed to tax personal income in addition to the national government. Many of these subdivisions use a flat rate, even if their national government uses progressive rates. Examples are all counties and municipalities of the Nordic countries, all prefectures and municipalities of Japan, and some subdivisions of Italy and of the United States.

=== Jurisdictions that use flat taxes on personal income ===

==== National or single level ====
The table below lists jurisdictions where personal income is taxed by only one government level, using a flat rate. It includes independent countries and other autonomous jurisdictions. The tax rate listed is the one that applies to income from work, but does not include mandatory contributions to social security. In some jurisdictions, different rates (also flat) apply to other types of income, such as from investments.

==== Subnational jurisdictions ====
The table below lists jurisdictions where personal income is taxed by multiple government levels, and at least one level uses a flat rate. The tax rates listed are those that apply to income from work, except as otherwise noted. Where a range of rates is listed, it means that the flat rate varies by location, not progressive rates.

==== Jurisdictions without permanent population ====
Despite not having a permanent population, some jurisdictions tax the local income of temporary workers, using a flat rate.

=== Jurisdictions reputed to have a flat tax ===
* does not have a general income tax, but it imposes a &quot;Universal Social Levy&quot; on salaries, composed of a portion paid by the employer and another paid by the employee through withholding. Each portion has a flat rate of 3%. This tax is in addition to a mandatory contribution to social security.
* imposes progressive tax rates of 14% and 25% on income from employment in the oil and gas and public sectors, but a flat tax rate of 14% on income from employment in other sectors and on investment income. It also imposes a flat tax rate of 20% on business income.
* do not have a general income tax, but impose a payroll tax on salaries, composed of a portion paid by the employer and another paid by the employee through withholding. The employee portion has a flat rate of 8%. This tax is in addition to mandatory contributions to social security and national health insurance.
* does not have a general income tax, but it imposes zakat (wealth tax) on the business assets of residents who are nationals of GCC countries, and income tax on the business income of residents who are not nationals of GCC countries and of nonresidents. Zakat has a flat rate of 2.5%, and income tax has a flat rate of 20%.
* do not have a general income tax, but tax business income exceeding a threshold at a flat rate of 9%.

However, this tax also applied to employer contributions to social security and health insurance, for an effective tax rate of about 20% on income from work up to the contribution limit. In 2013, a tax of 7% was added to income from work above the contribution limit, for an effective second rate of 22%. In 2021, the tax rates became 15 and 23%, both applying to all types of income and no longer to employer contributions.

<doc id="46335" wikidata="Q2439238" url="?curid=46335" title="Stone Soup">
<text>Stone Soup is a European folk story in which hungry strangers convince the people of a town to each share a small amount of their food in order to make a meal. In varying traditions, the stone has been replaced with other common inedible objects, and therefore the parable is also known as axe soup, button soup, nail soup, bolt soup, and wood soup.

==Story==

Some travelers come to a village, carrying nothing more than an empty cooking pot. Upon their arrival, the villagers are unwilling to share any of their food stores with the very hungry travelers. Then the travelers go to a stream and fill the pot with water, drop a large stone in it, and place it over a fire. One of the villagers becomes curious and asks what they are doing. The travelers answer that they are making &quot;stone soup&quot;, which tastes wonderful and which they would be delighted to share with the villager, although it still needs a little bit of garnish, which they are missing, to improve the flavor.

The villager, who anticipates enjoying a share of the soup, does not mind parting with a few carrots, so these are added to the soup. Another villager walks by, inquiring about the pot, and the travelers again mention their stone soup which has not yet reached its full potential. More and more villagers walk by, each adding another ingredient, like potatoes, onions, cabbages, peas, celery, tomatoes, sweetcorn, meat (like chicken, pork and beef), milk, butter, salt and pepper. Finally, the stone (being inedible) is removed from the pot, and a delicious and nourishing pot of soup is enjoyed by travelers and villagers alike. Although the travelers have thus tricked the villagers into sharing their food with them, they have successfully transformed it into a tasty meal which they share with the donors.

== Variations ==
*An Eastern European variation of the story (which is similar to the Northern European rendition) is called &quot;axe soup&quot;, with an axe as the catalyst.
*In the French, Hungarian and Russian versions of the tale, the travelers are soldiers returning home.
**In the Hungarian version, a single starving soldier tries to obtain food from villagers. He comes upon an old woman and tricks her into giving him the ingredients needed for the soup; At the end of the tale, they share the soup, and he sells the rock to the woman.
**In Russian tradition, a soldier prepares &quot;axe kasha&quot; (). The tale ends with the soldier taking the axe when leaving, claiming he will eat it on the road.
*Johann Peter Hebel wrote a German version, &quot;Der schlaue Pilgrim&quot; (&quot;The Cunning Pilgrim&quot;, 1811), in which a wily pilgrim, allegedly on his way to Jerusalem, tricks a hostess step-by-step into adding rich soup ingredients to his pebble stones, finally leaving the stones uneaten.
* In Northern European and Scandinavian countries, as well as Poland, the story is most commonly known as &quot;nail soup&quot;, and the main character is typically a tramp looking for food and lodgings, who convinces an old woman that he will make a tasty nail soup for the both of them if she would just add a few ingredients for the garnish.
* In the Portuguese tradition, the traveler is a monk, and the story takes place around Almeirim, Portugal. Nowadays is considered a regional dish of Almeirim.
*The archetypal foolishness of the residents of the Dutch city of Kampen gave rise to the term (Kamper ui, plural: Kamper uien) for town-of-fools type stories: a tramp convinces a farmer and his wife that he knows how to cook a nutritious stew from onion and salt. But while cooking he adds plenty of other stuff &quot;to improve the taste&quot;.

===Art, entertainment, and media===

====&quot;Stone soup&quot;-like collaborations====
There are many examples of projects referencing the &quot;Stone Soup&quot; story&#x27;s theme of making something significant by accumulating many small contributions. Examples include: 
*&quot;Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup&quot;, a computer game which expanded on an abandoned project using contributions from many different coders
*&quot;Stone Soup&quot;, a children&#x27;s literary magazine published by the California-based Children&#x27;s Art Foundation since 1973
*Stone Soupercomputer, a computer composed of many small units
*Stone Soup, an open-source software project aimed at providing researchers and practitioners with a framework for the development and testing of Bayesian target tracking and state estimation algorithms.

===Adaptations===

====Film====
The film &quot;Fandango&quot; (1985) contains a wedding sequence towards the end which builds on the Stone Soup theme. The protagonists need to hold a wedding ceremony, but they lack the necessary funds. Therefore, they set up a folding card table by the main street of a sleepy Texas town, dust it off, and invite passersby to come to the wedding. As they concoct stories of delinquent caterers and crashed champagne trucks, the friendly townspeople contribute their time and resources, the result being a magical wedding ceremony.

====Literature====

Gerald P. Murphy&#x27;s stage adaptation of &quot;Stone Soup&quot; was published by Lazy Bee Scripts in 2008 and has had successful productions in US, UK and France.

Gerald Griffin wrote &quot;The Collegians&quot; (1829) which includes a version of limestone soup in chapter 30.

William Butler Yeats&#x27; play &quot;The Pot of Broth&quot; (1904) tells a version of the story in which a clever Irish tramp uses his wits to swindle a shrewish medieval housewife out of her dinner.

The story is the basis of Marcia Brown&#x27;s 1947 children&#x27;s book &quot;Stone Soup: An Old Tale&quot; (1947), which features soldiers tricking miserly villagers into cooking them a feast. The book was a Caldecott Honor book in 1948 and was read aloud by the Captain (played by Bob Keeshan) on an early episode of &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; in the 1950s, as well as at least once in the 1960s or early 1970s.

In 1965, Gordon R. Dickson published a short story called &quot;Soupstone&quot;, where a headstrong pilot is sent to solve a problem on a planet under the guise of a highly educated and competent official. He succeeds by pretending to understand everything, but actually merely making the locals apply their already present knowledge and abilities to the task.

&quot;Stone Soup&quot; (1968), written by Ann McGovern and illustrated by Nola Langner, tells the story of a little old lady and a hungry young man at the door asking for food, and how he tricks her into making stone soup. The book was reprinted and reissued in 1986 with Winslow Pinney Pels as the illustrator.

In 1975, Walt Disney Productions published a Wonderful World of Reading book titled &quot;Button Soup&quot;. Daisy Duck tricks Scrooge McDuck to share his food to help flavor her Button Soup.

Canadian children&#x27;s author Aubrey Davis adapted the story to a Jewish context in his book &quot;Bone Button Borscht&quot; (1996). According to Davis, he wrote the story when he was unable to find a story that he liked for a Hanukkah reading. Barbara Budd&#x27;s narration of &quot;Bone Button Borscht&quot; traditionally airs across Canada on CBC Radio One&#x27;s &quot;As It Happens&quot;, on the first day of Hanukkah.

French author and illustrator Anais Vaugelade published a children&#x27;s picture book, &quot;Une soupe au caillou&quot;, in which the tramp from the original folktale is replaced by a wandering wolf, and the old woman by a curious hen. All characters in the story are animals, gathering to help making the stone soup, each of them carrying an ingredient for the final dish.

Jon J. Muth&#x27;s children&#x27;s book based on the story, also called &quot;Stone Soup&quot; (2003), is set in China, as is Ying Chang&#x27;s &quot;The Real Story of Stone Soup&quot; (2007).

Robert Rankin&#x27;s book Nostradamus Ate My Hamster features a version of the story introduced as an old Irish tale.

====Music====
Shel Silverstein&#x27;s song &quot;The Wonderful Soup Stone&quot; tells a version of this story. Bobby Bare included the song on his album &quot;Lullabys, Legends and Lies&quot; (1973). and Dr. Hook &amp; the Medicine Show included the song on their album &quot;Belly Up!&quot; (1973).

A version of the tale written by Tom Chapin and John Forster appears on Chapin&#x27;s album &quot;Mother Earth&quot; (1990).

&quot;Stone Soup&quot; – an album released in November 2001 by the UK artist Moss (a.k.a. Bernard Moss) on Pork Recordings (catalogue ref. PORK 091).

&quot;Stone Soup&quot; - A song featured on the album Mr. Supernatural in 2004 by the artist King Khan and the Shrines on Hazelwood Records

====Television====
* Jim Henson&#x27;s &quot;The Storyteller&quot; series contains one tale called &quot;A Story Short&quot;, in which the Storyteller himself (played by John Hurt) is the main character. In the beginning, he arrives at a castle where a man is thrown out for begging for food. He proceeds to trick the King&#x27;s cook into making stone soup. After the people are happily fed, the cook realizes what has happened and pleads with the King to let him boil the Storyteller in oil, but the King instead offers a way out — to tell him a story every day for a year instead.
* The PBS Kids show &quot;Between the Lions&quot; featured an episode with a version of the story being read. In this version, the strangers were replaced by aliens.
* The tale was adapted as an episode of the show &quot;Hungarian Folktales&quot;.
* A Soviet cartoon based on the Russian variant of the tale was made in 1982.
* &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; (1974 TV series) Season 1, Episode 14 is entitled &quot;Stone Soup&quot; in which Marshal (the father) uses Stone Soup to get his children to help gather things for dinner. Ta brings a bearded dragon (called an iguana) to the soup, although the second season states that Pakuni are vegetarians.
* &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; Season 8, Episode 13 is entitled &quot;Stone Soup&quot; and has this story as its theme.
* &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; Season 9, Episode 13 is entitled &quot;Gimme That Chocolate Milk&quot; and has a short sketch making fun of this parable. In it, the villagers kill the stranger who tricked them into sharing in order to cover up their &quot;communal embarrassment&quot;.
* &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; Season 10, Episode 21. Carol mentions the &quot;Stone Soup&quot; story.

===Military tactics===
US Army General George S. Patton referred to the &quot;rock soup method&quot; of acquiring resources for attacks in the face of official disapproval by his superiors for offensive operations. In the military context, he sent units forward, ostensibly on reconnaissance missions, where he knew resistance was to be met. &quot;Surprised&quot; at the enemy resistance, Patton would later request support for his scouts, and these missions eventually turned into small scale probing attacks. Then, once full combat had begun, Patton would request (or make the executive decision) to encircle or push full force against enemy resistance, under the rationale that the reinforcements were either bogged down or unable to retreat. He did this during the Battle of Sicily, in the advance on Palermo, and again in the campaign in northwest Europe, near Metz when his 3rd US Army was officially halted during Operation Market Garden.

===Places===
A large pool located on Karl Johan street in Oslo, funded by the steel company &quot;Christiania Spigerverk&quot; (&quot;Christiania Nail Factory&quot;), is nicknamed &quot;Spikersuppa&quot; (&quot;Nail Soup&quot;) as a humorous reference to the story.

<doc id="46336" wikidata="Q25341" url="?curid=46336" title="Passerine">
<text>A passerine () is any bird of the order Passeriformes (; from Latin &#x27;sparrow&#x27; and &#x27;-shaped&#x27;) which includes more than half of all bird species. Sometimes known as perching birds, passerines generally have an anisodactyl arrangement of their toes (three pointing forward and one back), which facilitates perching.

With more than 140 families and some 6,500 identified species, Passeriformes is the largest order of birds and among the most diverse clades of terrestrial vertebrates, representing 60% of birds. Passerines are divided into three suborders: New Zealand wrens; diverse birds found only in North and South America; and songbirds. Passerines originated in the Southern Hemisphere around 60 million years ago.

Most passerines are insectivorous or omnivorous, and eat both insects and fruit or seeds.

==Etymology==
The terms &quot;passerine&quot; and &quot;Passeriformes&quot; are derived from the scientific name of the house sparrow, &quot;Passer domesticus&quot;, whose genus is the Latin word for sparrow. Formerly this meant the songbirds of Europe. Now it also includes perching, non-singing birds from the Americas.

==Description==
The order is divided into three suborders, Tyranni (non-singing, Americas), Passeri (songbirds), and the basal New Zealand wrens. Oscines have the best control of their syrinx muscles among birds, producing a wide range of songs and other vocalizations, though some of them, such as the crows, do not sound musical to human beings. Some, such as the lyrebird, are accomplished mimics. The New Zealand wrens are tiny birds restricted to New Zealand, at least in modern times; they were long placed in Passeri.
Most passerines are smaller than typical members of other avian orders. The heaviest and altogether largest passerines are the thick-billed raven and the larger races of common raven, each exceeding and . The superb lyrebird and some birds-of-paradise, due to very long tails or tail coverts, are longer overall. The smallest passerine is the short-tailed pygmy tyrant, at and .

==Anatomy==
The foot of a passerine has three toes directed forward and one toe directed backward, called anisodactyl arrangement. The hind toe (hallux) is long and joins the leg at approximately the same level as the front toes. This arrangement enables passerine birds to easily perch upright on branches. The toes have no webbing or joining, but in some cotingas, the second and third toes are united at their basal third.

The leg of passerine birds contains an additional special adaptation for perching. A tendon in the rear of the leg running from the underside of the toes to the muscle behind the tibiotarsus will automatically be pulled and tighten when the leg bends, causing the foot to curl and become stiff when the bird lands on a branch. This enables passerines to sleep while perching without falling off.

Most passerine birds have 12 tail feathers but the superb lyrebird has 16, and several spinetails in the family Furnariidae have 10, 8, or even 6, as is the case of Des Murs&#x27;s wiretail. Species adapted to tree trunk climbing such as treecreepers and woodcreeper have stiff tail feathers that are used as props during climbing. Extremely long tails used as sexual ornaments are shown by species in different families. A well-known example is the long-tailed widowbird.

==Eggs and nests==

The chicks of passerines are altricial: blind, featherless, and helpless when hatched from their eggs. Hence, the chicks require extensive parental care. Most passerines lay colored eggs, in contrast with nonpasserines, most of whose eggs are white except in some ground-nesting groups such as Charadriiformes and nightjars, where camouflage is necessary, and in some parasitic cuckoos, which match the passerine host&#x27;s egg. The vinous-throated parrotbill has two egg colors, white and blue, to deter the brood parasitic common cuckoo.

Clutches vary considerably in size: some larger passerines of Australia such as lyrebirds and scrub-robins lay only a single egg, most smaller passerines in warmer climates lay between two and five, while in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, hole-nesting species like tits can lay up to a dozen and other species around five or six.
The family Viduidae do not build their own nests, instead, they lay eggs in other birds&#x27; nests.

The Passeriformes contain several groups of brood parasites such as the viduas, cuckoo-finches, and the cowbirds.

==Origin and evolution==
The evolutionary history of the passerine families and the relationships among them remained rather mysterious until the late 20th century. In many cases, passerine families were grouped together on the basis of morphological similarities that, it is now believed, are the result of convergent evolution, not a close genetic relationship. For example, the wrens of the Americas and Eurasia, those of Australia, and those of New Zealand look superficially similar and behave in similar ways, yet belong to three far-flung branches of the passerine family tree; they are as unrelated as it is possible to be while remaining Passeriformes.

Advances in molecular biology and improved paleobiogeographical data gradually are revealing a clearer picture of passerine origins and evolution that reconciles molecular affinities, the constraints of morphology, and the specifics of the fossil record. The first passerines are now thought to have evolved in the Southern Hemisphere in the late Paleocene or early Eocene, around 50 million years ago.

The initial diversification of passerines coincides with the separation of the southern continents in the early Eocene. The New Zealand wrens are the first to become isolated in Zealandia, and the second split involved the origin of the Tyranni in South America and the Passeri in the Australian continent. The Passeri experienced a great radiation of forms in Australia. A major branch of the Passeri, the parvorder Passerida, dispersed into Eurasia and Africa about 40 million years ago, where they experienced further radiation of new lineages. This eventually led to three major Passerida lineages comprising about 4,000 species, which in addition to the Corvida and numerous minor lineages make up songbird diversity today. Extensive biogeographical mixing happens, with northern forms returning to the south, southern forms moving north, and so on.

===Fossil record===
====Earliest passerines====

Perching bird osteology, especially of the limb bones, is rather diagnostic. However, the early fossil record is poor because passerines are relatively small, and their delicate bones do not preserve well. Queensland Museum specimens F20688 (carpometacarpus) and F24685 (tibiotarsus) from Murgon, Queensland, are fossil bone fragments initially assigned to Passeriformes. However, the material is too fragmentary and their affinities have been questioned. Several more recent fossils from the Oligocene of Europe, such as &quot;Wieslochia&quot;, &quot;Jamna&quot;, &quot;Resoviaornis,&quot; and &quot;Crosnoornis&quot;, are more complete and definitely represent early passeriforms, and have been found to belong to a variety of modern and extinct lineages.

From the Bathans Formation at the Manuherikia River in Otago, New Zealand, MNZ S42815 (a distal right tarsometatarsus of a tui-sized bird) and several bones of at least one species of saddleback-sized bird have recently been described. These date from the Early to Middle Miocene (Awamoan to Lillburnian, 19–16 mya).

====Early European passerines====
In Europe, perching birds are not too uncommon in the fossil record from the Oligocene onward, belonging to several lineages:
* &quot;Wieslochia&quot; (Early Oligocene of Frauenweiler, Germany) – suboscine
* &quot;Resoviaornis&quot; (Early Oligocene of Wola Rafałowska, Poland) – oscine
* &quot;Jamna&quot; (Early Oligocene of Jamna Dolna, Poland) – basal
* &quot;Winnicavis&quot; (Early Oligocene of Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Poland)
* &quot;Crosnoornis&quot; (Early Oligocene of Poland) - suboscine
* Passeriformes gen. et sp. indet. (Early Oligocene of Luberon, France) – suboscine or basal
* Passeriformes gen. et spp. indet. (Late Oligocene of France) – several suboscine and oscine taxa
* Passeriformes gen. et spp. indet. (Middle Miocene of France and Germany) – basal?
* Passeriformes gen. et spp. indet. (Sajóvölgyi Middle Miocene of Mátraszőlős, Hungary) – at least 2 taxa, possibly 3; at least one probably Oscines.
* Passeriformes gen. et sp. indet. (Middle Miocene of Felsőtárkány, Hungary) – oscine?
* Passeriformes gen. et sp. indet. (Late Miocene of Polgárdi, Hungary) – Sylvioidea (Sylviidae? Cettiidae?)
That suboscines expanded much beyond their region of origin is proven by several fossils from Germany such as a presumed broadbill (Eurylaimidae) humerus fragment from the Early Miocene (roughly 20 mya) of Wintershof, Germany, the Late Oligocene carpometacarpus from France listed above, and &quot;Wieslochia&quot;, among others. Extant Passeri super-families were quite distinct by that time and are known since about 12–13 mya when modern genera were present in the corvoidean and basal songbirds. The modern diversity of Passerida genera is known mostly from the Late Miocene onward and into the Pliocene (about 10–2 mya). Pleistocene and early Holocene lagerstätten (&lt;1.8 mya) yield numerous extant species, and many yield almost nothing but extant species or their chronospecies and paleosubspecies.

====American fossils====

In the Americas, the fossil record is more scant before the Pleistocene, from which several still-existing families are documented. Apart from the indeterminable MACN-SC-1411 (Pinturas Early/Middle Miocene of Santa Cruz Province, Argentina), an extinct lineage of perching birds has been described from the Late Miocene of California, United States: the Palaeoscinidae with the single genus &quot;Palaeoscinis&quot;. &quot;&quot;Palaeostruthus&quot; eurius&quot; (Pliocene of Florida) probably belongs to an extant family, most likely passeroidean.

==Systematics and taxonomy==

The Passeriformes is currently divided into three suborders: Acanthisitti (New Zealand wrens), Tyranni, (suboscines) and Passeri (oscines or songbirds). The Passeri is now subdivided into two major groups recognized now as Corvides and Passerida respectively containing the large superfamilies Corvoidea and Meliphagoidea, as well as minor lineages, and the superfamilies Sylvioidea, Muscicapoidea, and Passeroidea but this arrangement has been found to be oversimplified. Since the mid-2000s, studies have investigated the phylogeny of the Passeriformes and found that many families from Australasia traditionally included in the Corvoidea actually represent more basal lineages within oscines. Likewise, the traditional three-superfamily arrangement within the Passeri has turned out to be far more complex and will require changes in classification.

Major &quot;wastebin&quot; families such as the Old World warblers and Old World babblers have turned out to be paraphyletic and are being rearranged. Several taxa turned out to represent highly distinct lineages, so new families had to be established, some of these – like the stitchbird of New Zealand and the Eurasian bearded reedling – monotypic with only one living species. In the Passeri alone, a number of minor lineages will eventually be recognized as distinct superfamilies. For example, the kinglets constitute a single genus with less than 10 species today but seem to have been among the first perching bird lineages to diverge as the group spread across Eurasia. No particularly close relatives of theirs have been found among comprehensive studies of the living Passeri, though they might be fairly close to some little-studied tropical Asian groups. Nuthatches, wrens, and their closest relatives are currently grouped in a distinct super-family Certhioidea.
==Taxonomic list of Passeriformes families==
This list is in taxonomic order, placing related families next to one another. The families listed are those recognised by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC). The order and the division into infraorders, parvorders, and superfamilies follows the phylogenetic analysis published by Carl Oliveros and colleagues in 2019. The relationships between the families in the suborder Tyranni (suboscines) were all well determined but some of the nodes in Passeri (oscines or songbirds) were unclear owing to the rapid splitting of the lineages.
