<text>Pax Americana (Latin for , modeled after &quot;Pax Romana&quot; and &quot;Pax Britannica&quot;), also called the &quot;[[Long Peace]]&quot;, is a term applied to the concept of relative peace in the Western Hemisphere and later in the world after the end of World War II in 1945, when the United States became the world&#x27;s dominant economic, cultural, and military power.

In this sense, &quot;Pax Americana&quot; has come to describe the military and economic position of the United States relative to other nations. The U.S. Marshall Plan, which saw the country transfer $13.3 billion (the equivalent of $173 billion in 2023) in economic recovery programs to Western European countries, has been described as &quot;the launching of the Pax Americana&quot;.

== Early period ==

The first articulation of a &quot;Pax Americana&quot; occurred after the end of the American Civil War (in which the United States both quashed its greatest disunity and demonstrated the ability to field millions of well-equipped soldiers utilizing modern tactics) with reference to the peaceful nature of the North American geographical region, and was abeyant at the commencement of the First World War. Its emergence was concurrent with the development of the idea of American exceptionalism. This view holds that the U.S. occupies a special niche among developed nations in terms of its national credo, historical evolution, political and religious institutions, and unique origins. The concept originates from Alexis de Tocqueville, who asserted that the then-50-year-old United States held a special place among nations because it was a country of immigrants and the first modern democracy. From the establishment of the United States after the American Revolution until the Spanish–American War, the foreign policy of the United States had a regional, instead of global, focus. The Pax Americana, which the Union enforced upon the states of central North America, was a factor in the United States&#x27; national prosperity. The larger states were surrounded by smaller states, but these had no anxieties: no standing armies to require taxes and hinder labor; no wars or rumors of wars that would interrupt trade; there is not only peace, but security, for the Pax Americana of the Union covered all the states within the federal constitutional republic. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first time the phrase appeared in print was in the August 1894 issue of &quot;Forum&quot;: &quot;The true cause for exultation is the universal outburst of patriotism in support of the prompt and courageous action of President Cleveland in maintaining the supremacy of law throughout the length and breadth of the land, in establishing the &quot;pax Americana&quot;.&quot;

With the rise of the New Imperialism in the Western hemisphere at the end of the 19th century, debates arose between imperialist and isolationist factions in the U.S. Here, &quot;Pax Americana&quot; was used to connote the peace across the United States and, more widely, as a Pan-American peace under the aegis of the Monroe Doctrine. Those who favored traditional policies of avoiding foreign entanglements included labor leader Samuel Gompers and steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie. American politicians such as Henry Cabot Lodge, William McKinley, and Theodore Roosevelt advocated an aggressive foreign policy, but the administration of President Grover Cleveland was unwilling to pursue such actions. On January 16, 1893, U.S. diplomatic and military personnel conspired with a small group of individuals to overthrow the constitutional government of the Kingdom of Hawaii and establish a Provisional Government and then a republic. On February 15, they presented a treaty for annexation of the Hawaiian Islands to the U.S. Senate, but opposition to annexation stalled its passage. The United States finally opted to annex Hawaii by way of the Newlands Resolution in July 1898.

After its victory in the Spanish–American War of 1898 and the subsequent acquisition of Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam, the United States had gained a colonial empire. By ejecting Spain from the Americas, the United States shifted its position to an uncontested regional power, and extended its influence into Southeast Asia and Oceania. Although U.S. capital investments within the Philippines and Puerto Rico were relatively small, these colonies were strategic outposts for expanding trade with Latin America and Asia, particularly China. In the Caribbean area, the United States established a sphere of influence in line with the Monroe Doctrine, not explicitly defined as such, but recognized in effect by other governments and accepted by at least some of the republics in that area. The events around the start of the 20th century demonstrated that the United States undertook an obligation, usual in such cases, of imposing a &quot;Pax Americana&quot;. As in similar instances elsewhere, this Pax Americana was not quite clearly marked in its geographical limit, nor was it guided by any theoretical consistency, but rather by the merits of the case and the test of immediate expediency in each instance. Thus, whereas the United States enforced a peace in much of the lands southward from the Nation and undertook measures to maintain internal tranquility in such areas, the United States on the other hand withdrew from interposition in Mexico.

European powers largely regarded these matters as the concern of the United States. Indeed, the nascent Pax Americana was, in essence, abetted by the policy of the United Kingdom, and the preponderance of global sea power which the British Empire enjoyed by virtue of the strength of the Royal Navy. Preserving the freedom of the seas and ensuring naval dominance had been the policy of the British since victory in the Napoleonic Wars. As it was not in the interests of the United Kingdom to permit any European power to interfere in Americas, the Monroe Doctrine was indirectly aided by the Royal Navy. British commercial interests in South America, which comprised a valuable component of the informal empire that accompanied Britain&#x27;s overseas possessions, and the economic importance of the United States as a trading partner, ensured that intervention by Britain&#x27;s rival European powers could not engage with the Americas.

The United States lost its Pacific and regionally bounded nature towards the end of the 19th century. The government adopted protectionism after the Spanish–American War and built up the navy, the &quot;Great White Fleet&quot;, to expand the reach of U.S. power. When Theodore Roosevelt became President in 1901, he accelerated a foreign policy shift away from isolationism towards foreign intervention which had begun under his predecessor, William McKinley. The Philippine–American War (1899–1913) arose from the ongoing Philippine Revolution against imperialism. Interventionism found its formal articulation in the 1904 Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, proclaiming the right of the United States to intervene in the affairs of weak states in the Americas in order to stabilize them, a moment that underlined the emergent U.S. regional hegemony. By 1900, the United States possessed the world&#x27;s largest industrial capacity and national income, having surpassed both the United Kingdom and Germany.

== Interwar period ==
The United States had been criticized for not taking up the hegemonic mantle following the disintegration of &quot;Pax Britannica&quot; before the First World War and during the interwar period due to the absence of established political structures, such as the World Bank or United Nations which would be created after World War II, and various internal policies, such as protectionism. Though, the United States participated in the Great War, according to Woodrow Wilson:

&lt;poem&gt;[...] to vindicate the principles of peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power and to set up amongst the really free and self-governed peoples of the world such a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth insure the observance of those principles.
[...] for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.&lt;/poem&gt;

The United States&#x27; entry into the Great War marked the abandonment of the traditional American policy of isolation and independence of world politics. Not at the close of the Civil War, not as the result of the Spanish War, but in the Interwar period did the United States become a part of the international system. With this global reorganization from the Great War, there were those in the American populace that advocated an activist role in international politics and international affairs by the United States. Activities that were initiated did not fall into political-military traps and, instead, focused on economic-ideological approaches that would increase the American Empire and general worldwide stability. Following the prior path, a precursor to the United Nations and a league to enforce peace, the League of Nations, was proposed by Woodrow Wilson. This was rejected by the American Government in favor of more economic-ideological approaches and the United States did not join the League. Additionally, there were even proposals of extending the Monroe Doctrine to Great Britain put forth to prevent a second conflagration on the European theater. Ultimately, the United States&#x27; proposals and actions did not stop the factors of European nationalism spawned by the previous war, the repercussions of Germany&#x27;s defeat, and the failures of the Treaty of Versailles from plunging the globe into a Second World War.

Between World War I and World War II, America also sought to continue to preserve &quot;Pax America&quot; as a corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. Some sought the peaceful and orderly evolution of existing conditions in the western hemisphere and nothing by immediate changes. Before 1917, the position of the United States government and the feelings of the nation in respect to the &quot;Great War&quot; initially had properly been one of neutrality. Its interests remained untouched, and nothing occurred of a nature to affect those interests.

The average American&#x27;s sympathies, on the other hand, if the feelings of the vast majority of the nation had been correctly interpreted, was with the Allied (Entente) Powers. The population of the United States was revolted at the ruthlessness of the Prussian doctrine of war, and German designs to shift the burden of aggression encountered skeptical derision. The American populace saw themselves safeguarding liberal peace in the Western World. To this end, the American writer Roland Hugins stated:

The truth is that the United States is the only high-minded Power left in the world. It is the only strong nation that has not entered on a career of imperial conquest, and does not want to enter on it. [...] There is in America little of that spirit of selfish aggression which lies at the heart of militarism. Here alone exists a broad basis for &quot;a new passionate sense of brotherhood, and a new scale of human values.&quot; We have a deep abhorrence of war for war&#x27;s sake; we are not enamored of glamour or glory. We have a strong faith in the principle of self-government. We do not care to dominate alien peoples, white or colored; we do not aspire to be the Romans of tomorrow or the &quot;masters of the world.&quot; The idealism of Americans centers in the future of America, wherein we hope to work out those principles of liberty and democracy to which we are committed. This political idealism, this strain of pacifism, this abstinence from aggression and desire to be left alone to work out our own destiny, has been manifest from the birth of the republic. We have not always followed our light, but we have never been utterly faithless to it.

It was observed during this time that the initial defeat of Germany opened a moral recasting of the world. The battles between Germans and Allies were seen as far less battles between different nations than they represent the contrast between Liberalism and reaction, between the aspirations of democracy and the Wilhelminism gospel of iron.

== Modern period ==
The modern &quot;Pax Americana&quot; era is cited by supporters and critics of U.S. foreign policy after World War II. From 1945 to 1991, it was a partial international order, as it applied only to the Western world, being preferable for some authors to speak about a &quot;Pax Americana et Sovietica&quot;. Many commentators and critics focus on American policies from 1992 to the present, and as such, it carries different connotations depending on the context. For example, it appears three times in the 90-page document, &quot;Rebuilding America&#x27;s Defenses,&quot; by the Project for the New American Century, but is also used by critics to characterize American dominance and hyperpower status as imperialist in function and basis. From about the mid-1940s until 1991, U.S. foreign policy was dominated by the Cold War, and characterized by its significant international military presence and greater diplomatic involvement. Seeking an alternative to the isolationist policies pursued after World War I, the United States defined a new policy called containment to oppose the spread of Soviet communism.

The modern &quot;Pax Americana&quot; may be seen as similar to the period of peace in Rome, &quot;Pax Romana&quot;. In both situations, the period of peace was &#x27;relative peace&#x27;. During both &quot;Pax Romana&quot; and &quot;Pax Americana&quot; wars continued to occur, but it was still a prosperous time for both Western and Roman civilizations. It is important to note that during these periods, and most other times of relative tranquility, the peace that is referred to does not mean complete peace. Rather, it simply means that the civilization prospered in their military, agriculture, trade, and manufacturing.

=== &quot;Pax Britannica&quot; heritage ===
From the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 until the First World War in 1914, the United Kingdom played the role of offshore-balancer in Europe, where the balance of power was the main aim. It was also in this time that the British Empire became the largest empire of all time. The global superiority of British military and commerce was guaranteed by dominance of a Europe lacking in strong nation-states, and the presence of the Royal Navy on all of the world&#x27;s oceans and seas. In 1905, the Royal Navy was superior to any two navies combined in the world. It provided services such as suppression of piracy and slavery. 

In this era of peace, though, there were several wars between the major powers: the Crimean War, the Franco-Austrian War, the Austro-Prussian War, the Franco-Prussian War, and the Russo-Japanese War, as well as numerous other wars. William Wohlforth has argued that this period of tranquility, sometimes termed &quot;La Belle Époque&quot;, was actually a series of hegemonic states imposing a peaceful order. In Wohlforth&#x27;s view, &quot;Pax Britannica&quot; transitioned to &quot;Pax Russica&quot; and then to &quot;Pax Germanica&quot;, before ultimately, between 1853 and 1871, ceasing to be a &quot;Pax&quot; of any kind.

During the &quot;Pax Britannica&quot;, America developed close ties with Britain, evolving into what has become known as a &quot;special relationship&quot; between the two. The many commonalities shared with the two nations (such as language and history) drew them together as allies. Under the managed transition of the British Empire to the Commonwealth of Nations, members of the British government, such as Harold Macmillan, liked to think of Britain&#x27;s relationship with America as similar to that of a progenitor Greece to America&#x27;s Rome. Throughout the years, both have been active in North American, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries.

=== Late 20th century ===

After the Second World War, no armed conflict emerged among major Western nations themselves, and no nuclear weapons were used in open conflict. The United Nations was also soon developed after World War II to help keep peaceful relations between nations and establishing the veto power for the permanent members of the UN Security Council, which included the United States.

In the second half of the 20th century, the USSR and US superpowers were engaged in the Cold War, which can be seen as a struggle between hegemonies for global dominance. After 1945, the United States enjoyed an advantageous position with respect to the rest of the industrialized world. In the Post–World War II economic expansion, the US was responsible for half of global industrial output, held 80 percent of the world&#x27;s gold reserves, and was the world&#x27;s sole nuclear power. The catastrophic destruction of life, infrastructure, and capital during the Second World War had exhausted the imperialism of the Old World, victor and vanquished alike. The largest economy in the world at the time, the United States recognized that it had come out of the war with its domestic infrastructure virtually unscathed and its military forces at unprecedented strength. Military officials recognized the fact that Pax Americana had been reliant on the effective United States air power, just as the instrument of Pax Britannica a century earlier was its sea power. In addition, a &quot;unipolar moment&quot; was seen to have occurred following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

The term &quot;Pax Americana&quot; was explicitly used by John F. Kennedy in the 1960s, who advocated against the idea, arguing that the Soviet bloc was composed of human beings with the same individual goals as Americans and that such a peace based on &quot;American weapons of war&quot; was undesirable:

I have, therefore, chosen this time and place to discuss a topic on which ignorance too often abounds and the truth too rarely perceived. And that is the most important topic on earth: peace. What kind of peace do I mean and what kind of a peace do we seek? Not a &quot;Pax Americana&quot; enforced on the world by American weapons of war. Not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave. I am talking about genuine peace, the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living, and the kind that enables men and nations to grow, and to hope, and build a better life for their children—not merely peace for Americans but peace for all men and women, not merely peace in our time but peace in all time.

Beginning around the Vietnam War, the &#x27;Pax Americana&#x27; term had started to be used by the critics of American Imperialism. Here in the late 20th-century conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States, the charge of &quot;Neocolonialism&quot; was often aimed at Western involvement in the affairs of the Third World and other developing nations. NATO became regarded as a symbol of &quot;Pax Americana&quot; in West Europe:

=== Contemporary power ===


Currently, the &quot;Pax Americana&quot; is based on the military preponderance beyond challenge by any combination of powers and projection of power throughout the world&#x27;s &quot;commons&quot;—neutral sea, air and space. This projection is coordinated by the Unified Command Plan which divides the world on regional branches controlled by a single command. Integrated with it are global network of military alliances (the Rio Pact, NATO, ANZUS and bilateral alliances with Japan and several other states) coordinated by Washington in a hub-and-spokes system and worldwide network of several hundreds of military bases and installations. Neither the Rio Treaty, nor NATO, for Robert J. Art, &quot;was a regional collective security organization; rather both were regional imperia run and operated by the United States&quot;. Former Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski drew an expressive summary of the military foundation of &quot;Pax Americana&quot; shortly after the &quot;unipolar moment&quot;:

Besides the military foundation, there are significant non-military international institutions backed by American financing and diplomacy (like the United Nations and WTO). The United States invested heavily in programs such as the Marshall Plan and in the reconstruction of Japan, economically cementing defense ties that owed increasingly to the establishment of the Iron Curtain/Eastern Bloc and the widening of the Cold War.

Being in the best position to take advantage of free trade, culturally indisposed to traditional empires, and alarmed by the rise of communism in China and the detonation of the first Soviet atom bomb, the historically non-interventionist US also took a keen interest in developing multilateral institutions which would maintain a favorable world order among them. The International Monetary Fund and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank), part of the Bretton Woods system of international financial management was developed and, until the early 1970s, the existence of a fixed exchange rate to the US dollar. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was developed and consists of a protocol for normalization and reduction of trade tariffs.

With the fall of the Iron Curtain, the demise of the notion of a &quot;Pax Sovietica&quot;, and the end of the Cold War, the US maintained significant contingents of armed forces in Europe and East Asia. The institutions behind the Pax Americana and the rise of the United States unipolar power have persisted into the early 21st century. The ability of the United States to act as &quot;the world&#x27;s policeman&quot; has been constrained by its own citizens&#x27; historic aversion to foreign wars. Though there has been calls for the continuation of military leadership, as stated in &quot;Rebuilding America&#x27;s Defenses&quot;:

The American peace has proven itself peaceful, stable, and durable. It has, over the past decade, provided the geopolitical framework for widespread economic growth and the spread of American principles of liberty and democracy. Yet no moment in international politics can be frozen in time; even a global &quot;Pax Americana&quot; will not preserve itself. [... What is required is] a military that is strong and ready to meet both present and future challenges; a foreign policy that boldly and purposefully promotes American principles abroad; and national leadership that accepts the United States&#x27; global responsibilities.

This is reflected in the research of American exceptionalism, which shows that &quot;there is some indication for [being a leader of an &#x27;American peace&#x27;] among the [US] public, but very little evidence of unilateral attitudes&quot;. Resentments have arisen at a country&#x27;s dependence on American military protection, due to disagreements with United States foreign policy or the presence of American military forces.

In the &quot;post-communism&quot; world of the 21st-century, the French Socialist politician and former Foreign Minister Hubert Védrine describes the US as a hegemonic hyperpower, while the US political scientists John Mearsheimer and Joseph Nye counter that the US is not a &quot;true&quot; hegemony, because it does not have the resources to impose a proper, formal, global rule; despite its political and military strength, the US is economically equal to Europe, thus, cannot rule the international stage. Several other countries are either emerging or re-emerging as powers, such as China, Russia, India, and the European Union.

Joseph Nye discredited the United States as not a &quot;true&quot; hegemony in his 2002 article titled &quot;The New Rome Meets the New Barbarians&quot;. His book of the same year he opens: &quot;Not since Rome has one nation loomed so large above the others.&quot; And his 1991 book he titled &quot;Bound to Lead&quot;. &quot;Leadership&quot;, translated into Greek, renders &quot;hegemony&quot;; an alternative translation is &quot;archia&quot; – Greek common word for &quot;empire&quot;. Having defined the US hegemony as &quot;not true&quot;, Nye looks for an analogy to the true empire: Decline, he writes, is not necessarily imminent. &quot;Rome remained dominant for more than three centuries after the peak of its power ...

In fact, there are striking parallels with the early &quot;Pax Romana&quot; (especially between 189 BC when the supremacy over the Mediterranean was won and the first annexation in 168 BC). Under that &quot;Pax Romana&quot; other states remained formally independent and very seldom were called &quot;clients&quot;. The latter term became widely used only in the late medieval period. Usually, other states were called &quot;friends and allies&quot;—a popular expression under the &quot;Pax Americana&quot;.

One of the first to use the term &quot;Pax Americana&quot; was the Advisory Committee on Postwar Foreign Policy. In 1942, the Committee envisaged that the United States may have to supplant the British Empire. Therefore, the United States &quot;must cultivate a mental view toward world settlement after this war which will enable us to impose our own terms, amounting perhaps to a Pax Americana&quot;. According to Swen Holdar, the founder of geopolitics Rudolf Kjellen (1864–1922) predicted the era of US global supremacy using the term &quot;Pax Americana&quot; shortly after World War I. Writing in 1945, Ludwig Dehio remembered that the Germans used the term &quot;Pax Anglosaxonica&quot; in a sense of Pax Americana since 1918:

The United States, Dehio associates on the same page, withdrew to isolation on that occasion. &quot;Rome, too, had taken a long time to understand the significance of her world role.&quot; Two years earlier, with the war still at its peak, the founder of the Paneuropean Union, Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, invoked the example of the two-centuries long &quot;Pax Romana&quot; which, he suggested, could be repeated if based on the preponderant US air power:

One of the first criticisms of &quot;Pax Americana&quot; was written by Nathaniel Peffer in 1943:

He did not know if it would happen: &quot;It is conceivable that ... America might drift into empire, imperceptibly, stage by stage, in a kind of power-politics gravitation.&quot; He also noted that America was heading precisely in that direction: &quot;That there are certain stirrings in this direction is apparent, though how deep they go is unclear.&quot;

The depth soon became clarified. Two later critics of &quot;Pax Americana&quot;, Michio Kaku and David Axelrod, interpreted the outcome of Pax Americana: &quot;Gunboat diplomacy would be replaced by Atomic diplomacy. &quot;Pax Britannica&quot; would give way to &quot;Pax Americana&quot;.&quot; After the war, with the German and British militaries in tatters, only one force stood on the way to Pax Americana: the Soviet Army. Four years after this criticism was written, the Red Army withdrew, paving the way for the unipolar moment. Joshua Muravchik commemorated the event by titling his 1991 article, &quot;At Last, Pax Americana&quot;. He detailed:

The following year, in 1992, a US strategic draft for the post-Cold War period was leaked to the press. The person responsible for the confusion, former Assistant Secretary of State, Paul Wolfowitz, confessed seven years later: &quot;In 1992 a draft memo prepared by my office at the Pentagon ... leaked to the press and sparked a major controversy.&quot; The draft&#x27;s strategy aimed &quot;to prevent any hostile power from dominating&quot; a Eurasian region &quot;whose resources would, under consolidated control, be sufficient to generate global power&quot;. He added: &quot;Senator Joseph Biden ridiculed the proposed strategy as &#x27;literally a &quot;Pax Americana&quot; ... It won&#x27;t work ...&#x27; Just seven years later, many of these same critics seem quite comfortable with the idea of a &quot;Pax Americana&quot;.&quot;

The post-Cold War period, concluded William Wohlforth, much less ambiguously deserves to be called &quot;Pax Americana&quot;. &quot;Calling the current period the true Pax Americana may offend some, but it reflects reality&quot;.

The ‘’&quot;Pax Americana&quot;’’ motif reached its peak in the context of the 2003 Iraq War. The phrase &quot;American Empire&quot; appeared in one thousand news stories over a single six-month period in 2003. Jonathan Freedland observed:

&quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; illustrated a 2002 piece on US might with a drawing of George Bush togged up as a Roman centurion, complete with shield and spears. Bush&#x27;s visits to Germany in 2002 and 2006 resulted in further Bush-as-Roman-emperor invective appearing in the German press. In 2006, freelance writer, political satirist, and correspondent for the left-leaning &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot;, Arno Frank, compared the spectacle of the visit by &quot;Imperator&quot; Bush to &quot;elaborate inspection tours of Roman emperors in important but not completely pacified provinces—such as Germania&quot;. In September 2002, Boston&#x27;s WBUR-FM radio station titled a special on US imperial power with the tag &quot;Pax Americana&quot;. &quot;The Roman parallel&quot;, wrote Niall Ferguson in 2005, &quot;is in danger of becoming something of a cliché.&quot; Policy analyst Vaclav Smil titled his 2010 book by what he intended to explain: &quot;Why America Is Not a New Rome&quot;. The very phenomenon of the Roman-American association became the subject of research for Classicist Paul J. Burton.

Peter Bender, in his 2003 article &quot;America: The New Roman Empire&quot;, summarized: &quot;When politicians or professors are in need of a historical comparison in order to illustrate the United States&#x27; incredible might, they almost always think of the Roman Empire.&quot; The article abounds with analogies:

In 1998, American political author, Charles A. Kupchan, described the world order &quot;After Pax Americana&quot; and the next year &quot;The Life after Pax Americana&quot;. In 2003, he announced &quot;The End of the American Era&quot;. In 2012, he projected: &quot;America&#x27;s military strength will remain as central to global stability in the years ahead as it has been in the past.&quot;

The Russian analyst Leonid Grinin argues that at present and in the nearest future &quot;Pax Americana&quot; will remain an effective tool of supporting the world order since the US concentrates too many leadership functions which no other country is able to take to the full extent. Thus, he warns that the destruction of &quot;Pax Americana&quot; will bring critical transformations of the World-system with unclear consequences.

American political analyst Ian Bremmer argued that with the election of Donald Trump and the subsequent rise in populism in the west, as well as US withdrawal from international agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, NAFTA, and the Paris Climate Accords, that the &quot;Pax Americana&quot; is over.

American writer and academic Michael Lind stated that the &quot;Pax Americana&quot; withstood both the Cold War and the post-Cold War era, and &quot;today’s Second Cold War has strengthened rather than weakened America’s informal empire,&quot; at least for now.

<text>The Common Language Runtime (CLR), the virtual machine component of Microsoft .NET Framework, manages the execution of .NET programs. Just-in-time compilation converts the managed code (compiled intermediate language code) into machine instructions which are then executed on the CPU of the computer. The CLR provides additional services including memory management, type safety, exception handling, garbage collection, security and thread management. All programs written for the .NET Framework, regardless of programming language, are executed in the CLR. All versions of the .NET Framework include CLR. The CLR team was started June 13, 1998.

CLR implements the Virtual Execution System (VES) as defined in the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) standard, initially developed by Microsoft itself. A public standard defines the Common Language Infrastructure specification.

During the transition from legacy .NET technologies like the .NET Framework and its proprietary runtime to the community-developed .NET Core, the CLR was dubbed CoreCLR. Today, it is simply called the .NET runtime.

<text>Common Intermediate Language (CIL), formerly called Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) or Intermediate Language (IL), is the intermediate language binary instruction set defined within the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) specification. CIL instructions are executed by a CIL-compatible runtime environment such as the Common Language Runtime. Languages which target the CLI compile to CIL. CIL is object-oriented, stack-based bytecode. Runtimes typically just-in-time compile CIL instructions into native code.

CIL was originally known as Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) during the beta releases of the .NET languages. Due to standardization of C# and the CLI, the bytecode is now officially known as CIL. Windows Defender virus definitions continue to refer to binaries compiled with it as MSIL.

==General information==
During compilation of CLI programming languages, the source code is translated into CIL code rather than into platform- or processor-specific object code. CIL is a CPU- and platform-independent instruction set that can be executed in any environment supporting the Common Language Infrastructure, such as the .NET runtime on Windows, or the cross-platform Mono runtime. In theory, this eliminates the need to distribute different executable files for different platforms and CPU types. CIL code is verified for safety during runtime, providing better security and reliability than natively compiled executable files.

The execution process looks like this:

#Source code is converted to CIL bytecode and a CLI assembly is created.
#Upon execution of a CIL assembly, its code is passed through the runtime&#x27;s JIT compiler to generate native code. Ahead-of-time compilation may also be used, which eliminates this step, but at the cost of executable-file portability.
#The computer&#x27;s processor executes the native code.

==Instructions==
CIL bytecode has instructions for the following groups of tasks:
*Load and store
*Arithmetic
*Type conversion
*Object creation and manipulation
*Operand stack management (push / pop)
*Control transfer (branching)
*Method invocation and return
*Throwing exceptions
*Monitor-based concurrency
*Data and function pointers manipulation needed for C++/CLI and unsafe C# code

==Computational model==
The Common Intermediate Language is object-oriented and stack-based, which means that instruction parameters and results are kept on a single stack instead of in several registers or other memory locations, as in most programming languages.

Code that adds two numbers in x86 assembly language, where eax and edx specify two different general-purpose registers:

add eax, edx
Code in an intermediate language (IL), where 0 is eax and 1 is edx:

ldloc.0 // push local variable 0 onto stack
ldloc.1 // push local variable 1 onto stack
add // pop and add the top two stack items then push the result onto the stack
stloc.0 // pop and store the top stack item to local variable 0
In the latter example, the values of the two registers, eax and edx, are first pushed on the stack. When the add-instruction is called the operands are &quot;popped&quot;, or retrieved, and the result is &quot;pushed&quot;, or stored, on the stack. The resulting value is then popped from the stack and stored in eax.

===Object-oriented concepts===
CIL is designed to be object-oriented. One may create objects, call methods, and use other types of members, such as fields.

Every method needs (with some exceptions) to reside in a class. So does this static method:

.class public Foo {
 .method public static int32 Add(int32, int32) cil managed {
 .maxstack 2
 ldarg.0 // load the first argument;
 ldarg.1 // load the second argument;
 add // add them;
 ret // return the result;
}
The method Add does not require any instance of Foo to be declared because it is declared as static, and it may then be used like this in C#:

int r = Foo.Add(2, 3); // 5
In CIL it would look like this:

ldc.i4.2
ldc.i4.3
call int32 Foo::Add(int32, int32)
stloc.0
====Instance classes====
An instance class contains at least one constructor and some instance members. The following class has a set of methods representing actions of a Car-object.

.class public Car {
 .method public specialname rtspecialname instance void .ctor(int32, int32) cil managed {
 /* Constructor */

 .method public void Move(int32) cil managed { /* Omitting implementation */ }
 .method public void TurnRight() cil managed { /* Omitting implementation */ }
 .method public void TurnLeft() cil managed { /* Omitting implementation */ }
 .method public void Brake() cil managed { /* Omitting implementation */ }


====Creating objects====
In C# class instances are created like this:

Car myCar = new Car(1, 4); 
Car yourCar = new Car(1, 3); 
And those statements are roughly the same as these instructions in CIL:

ldc.i4.1
ldc.i4.4
newobj instance void Car::.ctor(int, int)
stloc.0 // myCar = new Car(1, 4);
ldc.i4.1
ldc.i4.3
newobj instance void Car::.ctor(int, int)
stloc.1 // yourCar = new Car(1, 3);
====Invoking instance methods====
Instance methods are invoked in C# as the one that follows:

myCar.Move(3);
As invoked in CIL:

ldloc.0 // Load the object &quot;myCar&quot; on the stack
ldc.i4.3
call instance void Car::Move(int32)
===Metadata===
The Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) records information about compiled classes as metadata. Like the type library in the Component Object Model, this enables applications to support and discover the interfaces, classes, types, methods, and fields in the assembly. The process of reading such metadata is called &quot;reflection&quot;.

Metadata can be data in the form of &quot;attributes&quot;. Attributes can be customized by extending the codice_1 class. This is a powerful feature. It allows the creator of the class the ability to adorn it with extra information that consumers of the class can use in various meaningful ways, depending on the application domain.

==Example==
Below is a basic &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program written in CIL assembler. It will display the string &quot;Hello, world!&quot;.

.assembly Hello {}
.assembly extern mscorlib {}
.method static void Main()
 .entrypoint
 .maxstack 1
 ldstr &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
 call void [mscorlib]System.Console::WriteLine(string)
 ret


The following code is more complex in number of opcodes.

&quot;This code can also be compared with the corresponding code in the article about Java bytecode.&quot;

static void Main(string[] args)
 for (int i = 2; i &lt; 1000; i++)
 for (int j = 2; j &lt; i; j++)
 if (i % j == 0)
 goto outer;
 Console.WriteLine(i);
 outer:;
}
In CIL assembler syntax it looks like this:

.method private hidebysig static void Main(string[] args) cil managed
 .entrypoint
 .maxstack 2
 .locals init (int32 V_0,
 int32 V_1)

 ldc.i4.2
 stloc.0
 br.s IL_001f
 IL_0004: ldc.i4.2
 stloc.1
 br.s IL_0011
 IL_0008: ldloc.0
 ldloc.1
 rem
 brfalse.s IL_001b
 ldloc.1
 ldc.i4.1
 add
 stloc.1
 IL_0011: ldloc.1
 ldloc.0
 blt.s IL_0008
 ldloc.0
 call void [mscorlib]System.Console::WriteLine(int32)
 IL_001b: ldloc.0
 ldc.i4.1
 add
 stloc.0
 IL_001f: ldloc.0
 ldc.i4 0x3e8
 blt.s IL_0004
 ret


This is just a representation of how CIL looks near the virtual machine (VM) level. When compiled the methods are stored in tables and the instructions are stored as bytes inside the assembly, which is a Portable Executable (PE).

==Generation==
A CIL assembly and instructions are generated by either a compiler or a utility called the &quot;IL Assembler&quot; (ILAsm) that is shipped with the execution environment.

Assembled CIL can also be disassembled into code again using the &quot;IL Disassembler&quot; (ILDASM). There are other tools such as .NET Reflector that can decompile CIL into a high-level language (e. g. C# or Visual Basic). This makes CIL a very easy target for reverse engineering. This trait is shared with Java bytecode. However, there are tools that can obfuscate the code, and do it so that the code cannot be easily readable but still be runnable.

==Execution==

===Just-in-time compilation===
Just-in-time compilation (JIT) involves turning the byte-code into code immediately executable by the CPU. The conversion is performed gradually during the program&#x27;s execution. JIT compilation provides environment-specific optimization, runtime type safety, and assembly verification. To accomplish this, the JIT compiler examines the assembly metadata for any illegal accesses and handles violations appropriately.

===Ahead-of-time compilation===
CLI-compatible execution environments also come with the option to do an Ahead-of-time compilation (AOT) of an assembly to make it execute faster by removing the JIT process at runtime.

In the .NET Framework there is a special tool called the Native Image Generator (NGEN) that performs the AOT. A different approach for AOT is CoreRT that allows the compilation of .Net Core code to a single executable with no dependency on a runtime. In Mono there is also an option to do an AOT.

==Pointer instructions - C++/CLI==
A notable difference from Java&#x27;s bytecode is that CIL comes with , , , and many call instructions which are enough for data/function pointers manipulation needed to compile C/C++ code into CIL.
class A {
 public: virtual void __stdcall meth() {}
void test_pointer_operations(int param) {
 int k = 0;
 int * ptr = &amp;k;
 *ptr = 1;
 ptr = &amp;param;
 *ptr = 2;
 A a;
 A * ptra = &amp;a;
 ptra-&gt;meth();


The corresponding code in CIL can be rendered as this:
.method assembly static void modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallConvCdecl) 
 test_pointer_operations(int32 param) cil managed
 .vtentry 1 : 1
 // Code size 44 (0x2c)
 .maxstack 2
 .locals ([0] int32* ptr,
 [1] valuetype A* V_1,
 [2] valuetype A* a,
 [3] int32 k)
// k = 0;
 IL_0000: ldc.i4.0 
 IL_0001: stloc.3
// ptr = &amp;k;
 IL_0002: ldloca.s k // load local&#x27;s address instruction
 IL_0004: stloc.0
// *ptr = 1;
 IL_0005: ldloc.0
 IL_0006: ldc.i4.1
 IL_0007: stind.i4 // indirection instruction
// ptr = &amp;param
 IL_0008: ldarga.s param // load parameter&#x27;s address instruction
 IL_000a: stloc.0
// *ptr = 2
 IL_000b: ldloc.0
 IL_000c: ldc.i4.2
 IL_000d: stind.i4
// a = new A;
 IL_000e: ldloca.s a
 IL_0010: call valuetype A* modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallConvThiscall) &#x27;A.{ctor}&#x27;(valuetype A* modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IsConst) modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IsConst))
 IL_0015: pop
// ptra = &amp;a;
 IL_0016: ldloca.s a
 IL_0018: stloc.1
// ptra-&gt;meth();
 IL_0019: ldloc.1
 IL_001a: dup
 IL_001b: ldind.i4 // reading the VMT for virtual call
 IL_001c: ldind.i4
 IL_001d: calli unmanaged stdcall void modopt([mscorlib]System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallConvStdcall)(native int)
 IL_0022: ret
} // end of method &#x27;Global Functions&#x27;::test_pointer_operations

<text>Freedom of religion or religious liberty, also known as freedom of religion or belief (FoRB), is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or community, in public or private, to manifest religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance. It also includes the right not to profess any religion or belief or &quot;not to practice a religion&quot; (often called freedom &quot;from&quot; religion).

The concept of religious liberty includes, and some say requires, secular liberalism, and excludes authoritarian versions of secularism.

Freedom of religion is considered by many people and most nations to be a fundamental human right. Freedom of religion is protected in all the most important international human rights conventions, such as the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the American Convention on Human Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. In a country with a state religion, freedom of religion is generally considered to mean that the government permits religious practices of other communities besides the state religion, and does not persecute believers in other faiths or those who have no faith; in other countries, freedom of religion includes the right to refuse to support, by taxes or otherwise, a state religion.

Freedom of religion includes, at a minimum, &quot;freedom of belief&quot; (the right to believe whatever a person, group, or religion wishes, including all forms of irreligion, such as atheism, humanism, existentialism, or other forms of &quot;non-belief&quot;), but some feel freedom of religion must include &quot;freedom of practice&quot; (the right to practice a religion or belief openly and outwardly in a public manner, including the right not to practice any religion). A third term, &quot;freedom of worship&quot;, may be considered synonymous with both &quot;freedom of belief&quot; and &quot;freedom of practice&quot; or may be considered to fall between the two terms.

Crucial in the consideration of religious liberty is the question of whether religious practices and religiously motivated actions that would otherwise violate secular law should be permitted due to the safeguarding freedom of religion. This issue is addressed in numerous court cases including the United States Supreme Court cases &quot;Reynolds v. United States&quot; and &quot;Wisconsin v. Yoder&quot; and
in the European law cases of &quot;S.A.S. v. France&quot;, as well as numerous other jurisdictions.

Symbols of religious freedom are seen in significant locations around the world, such as the Statue of Liberty in New York, representing hope for religious refugees; the Touro Synagogue in Rhode Island, reflecting America&#x27;s early commitment to religious tolerance; and the Golden Temple in Amritsar, India, a symbol of religious inclusivity and freedom of worship. Other key sites include the Bahá&#x27;í Gardens in Haifa, Israel, which emphasize the unity of humanity and freedom of belief, and Lutherstadt Wittenberg in Germany, where Martin Luther&#x27;s actions sparked the Reformation, symbolizing a fight for religious reform and liberty.

==History==

In a historic setting freedom to worship has often been limited in practice through punitive taxation, repressive social legislation, and political disenfranchisement. An example commonly cited by scholars is the status of dhimmis under Islamic sharia law. Stemming from the Pact of Umar and literally meaning &quot;protected individuals&quot;, it is often argued that non-Muslims possessing the dhimmi status in medieval Islamic societies enjoyed greater freedoms than non-Christians in most medieval European societies, while duly noting that the protection was limited because of regulation by and obligations to government such as taxation (compare jizya and zakat) and military service differed between religions. In modern concepts of religious freedom, the law is usually blind to religious affiliation.

In Antiquity, a syncretic point of view often allowed communities of traders to operate under their own customs. When street mobs of separate quarters clashed in a Hellenistic or Roman city, the issue was generally perceived to be an infringement of community rights.

Cyrus the Great established the Achaemenid Empire ca. 550 BC, and initiated a general policy of permitting religious freedom throughout the empire, documenting this on the Cyrus Cylinder.

Freedom of religious worship was established in the Buddhist Maurya Empire of ancient India by Ashoka the Great in the 3rd century BC, which was encapsulated in the Edicts of Ashoka.

GreekJewish clashes at Cyrene in 73 AD and 117 AD and in Alexandria in 115 AD provide examples of cosmopolitan cities as scenes of tumult.

Genghis Khan was one of the first rulers who in 13th century enacted a law explicitly guaranteeing religious freedom to everyone and every religion.

===Ancient Roman policy===
The Romans tolerated most religions, including Judaism, and encouraged local subjects to continue worshipping their own gods. They did not however, tolerate Christianity, because of the Christian refusal to offer honours to the official cult of the emperor, until it was legalised by the Roman emperor Galerius in 311. Holmes and Bickers note that as long as Christianity was treated as a part of Judaism, which was generally tolerated because of its antiquity and its practice of making offers on &quot;behalf&quot; of the emperor, it enjoyed the same freedom, but the Christian claim to religious exclusivity meant its followers found themselves subject to hostility.

The early Christian apologist Tertullian was the first-known writer to employ the term &quot;freedom of religion&quot; (&quot;libertas religionis&quot;), which appears in the 24th chapter of his Apologeticum. He expanded on the case for the tolerance of all religious views in his epistle to proconsul Scapula, in which he states

The Edict of Milan guaranteed freedom of religion in the Roman Empire until the Edict of Thessalonica in 380, which outlawed all religions except Christianity.

===India===

Religious tolerance in India: A legacy of the past and a promise for the future

Ancient Jews fleeing from persecution in their homeland 2,500 years ago settled in modern-day India and never faced anti-Semitism. Freedom of religion edicts have been found written during Ashoka the Great&#x27;s reign in the 3rd century BC. Freedom to practise, preach and propagate any religion is a constitutional right in Republic of India. Most major religious festivals of the main communities are included in the list of national holidays.

Many scholars and intellectuals believe that India&#x27;s predominant religion, Hinduism, has long been a most tolerant religion. Rajni Kothari, founder of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies has written, &quot;[India] is a country built on the foundations of a civilisation that is fundamentally non-religious.&quot;
The Dalai Lama, the Tibetan leader in exile, said that religious tolerance of &#x27;Aryabhoomi,&#x27; a reference to India found in the Mahabharata, has been in existence in this country from thousands of years. &quot;Not only Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism which are the native religions but also Christianity and Islam have flourished here. Religious tolerance is inherent in Indian tradition,&quot; the Dalai Lama said.

Freedom of religion in the Indian subcontinent is exemplified by the reign of King Piyadasi (304–232 BC) (Ashoka). One of King Ashoka&#x27;s main concerns was to reform governmental institutes and exercise moral principles in his attempt to create a just and humane society. Later he promoted the principles of Buddhism, and the creation of a just, understanding and fair society was held as an important principle for many ancient rulers of this time in the East.

The importance of freedom of worship in India was encapsulated in an inscription of Ashoka:
On the main Asian continent, the Mongols were tolerant of religions. People could worship as they wished freely and openly.

After the arrival of Europeans, Christians in their zeal to convert local as per belief in conversion as service of God, have also been seen to fall into frivolous methods since their arrival, though by and large there are hardly any reports of law and order disturbance from mobs with Christian beliefs, except perhaps in the north eastern region of India.

Freedom of religion in contemporary India is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 25 of the nation&#x27;s constitution. Accordingly, every citizen of India has a right to profess, practice and propagate their religions peacefully.

In September 2010, the Indian state of Kerala&#x27;s State Election Commissioner announced that &quot;Religious heads cannot issue calls to vote for members of a particular community or to defeat the nonbelievers&quot;. The Catholic Church comprising Latin, Syro-Malabar and Syro-Malankara rites used to give clear directions to the faithful on exercising their franchise during elections through pastoral letters issued by bishops or council of bishops. The pastoral letter issued by Kerala Catholic Bishops&#x27; Council (KCBC) on the eve of the poll urged the faithful to shun atheists.

===Europe===

====Religious intolerance====

Most Roman Catholic kingdoms kept a tight rein on religious expression throughout the Middle Ages. Jews were alternately tolerated and persecuted, the most notable examples of the latter being the expulsion of all Jews from Spain in 1492. Some of those who remained and converted were tried as heretics in the Inquisition for allegedly practicing Judaism in secret. Despite the persecution of Jews, they were the most tolerated non-Catholic faith in Europe.

However, the latter was in part a reaction to the growing movement that became the Reformation. As early as 1380, John Wycliffe in England denied transubstantiation and began his translation of the Bible into English. He was condemned in a papal bull in 1410, and all his books were burned.

In 1414, Jan Hus, a Bohemian preacher of reformation, was given a safe conduct by the Holy Roman Emperor to attend the Council of Constance. Not entirely trusting in his safety, he made his will before he left. His forebodings proved accurate, and he was burned at the stake on 6 July 1415. The council also decreed that Wycliffe&#x27;s remains be disinterred and cast out. This decree was not carried out until 1429.

After the fall of the city of Granada, Spain, in 1492, the Muslim population was promised religious freedom by the Treaty of Granada, but that promise was short-lived. In 1501, Granada&#x27;s Muslims were given an ultimatum to either convert to Christianity or to emigrate. The majority converted, but only superficially, continuing to dress and speak as they had before and to secretly practice Islam. The Moriscos (converts to Christianity) were ultimately expelled from Spain between 1609 (Castile) and 1614 (rest of Spain), by Philip III.

Martin Luther published his famous 95 Theses in Wittenberg on 31 October 1517. His major aim was theological, summed up in the three basic dogmas of Protestantism:
* The Bible only is infallible.
* Every Christian can interpret it.
* Human sins are so wrongful that no deed or merit, only God&#x27;s grace, can lead to salvation.

In consequence, Luther hoped to stop the sale of indulgences and to reform the Church from within. In 1521, he was given the chance to recant at the Diet of Worms before Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. After he refused to recant, he was declared heretic. Partly for his own protection, he was sequestered on the Wartburg in the possessions of Frederick III, Elector of Saxony, where he translated the New Testament into German. He was excommunicated by papal bull in 1521.

However, the movement continued to gain ground in his absence and spread to Switzerland. Huldrych Zwingli preached reform in Zürich from 1520 to 1523. He opposed the sale of indulgences, celibacy, pilgrimages, pictures, statues, relics, altars, and organs. This culminated in outright war between the Swiss cantons that accepted Protestantism and the Catholics. In 1531, the Catholics were victorious, and Zwingli was killed in battle. The Catholic cantons made peace with Zurich and Berne.

The defiance of papal authority proved contagious, and in 1533, when Henry VIII of England was excommunicated for his divorce and remarriage to Anne Boleyn, he promptly established a state church with bishops appointed by the crown. This was not without internal opposition, and Thomas More, who had been his Lord Chancellor, was executed in 1535 for opposition to Henry.

In 1535, the Swiss canton of Geneva became Protestant. In 1536, the Bernese imposed the reformation on the canton of Vaud by conquest. They sacked the cathedral in Lausanne and destroyed all its art and statuary. John Calvin, who had been active in Geneva was expelled in 1538 in a power struggle, but he was invited back in 1540.
The same kind of seesaw back and forth between Protestantism and Catholicism was evident in England when Mary I of England returned that country briefly to the Catholic fold in 1553 and persecuted Protestants. However, her half-sister, Elizabeth I of England was to restore the Church of England in 1558, this time permanently, and began to persecute Catholics again. The King James Bible commissioned by King James I of England and published in 1611 proved a landmark for Protestant worship, with official Catholic forms of worship being banned.

In France, although peace was made between Protestants and Catholics at the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1570, persecution continued, most notably in the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s Day on 24 August 1572, in which thousands of Protestants throughout France were killed. A few years before, at the &quot;Michelade&quot; of Nîmes in 1567, Protestants had massacred the local Catholic clergy.

====Early steps and attempts in the way of tolerance====

The Norman Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II was characterized by its multi-ethnic nature and religious tolerance. Normans, Jews, Muslim Arabs, Byzantine Greeks, Lombards, and native Sicilians lived in harmony. Rather than exterminate the Muslims of Sicily, Roger II&#x27;s grandson Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen (1215–1250) allowed them to settle on the mainland and build mosques. Not least, he enlisted them in his Christian army and even into his personal bodyguards.

Kingdom of Bohemia (present-day Czech Republic) enjoyed religious freedom between 1436 and 1620 as a result of the Bohemian Reformation, and became one of the most liberal countries of the Christian world during that period of time. The so-called Basel Compacts of 1436 declared the freedom of religion and peace between Catholics and Utraquists. In 1609 Emperor Rudolf II granted Bohemia greater religious liberty with his Letter of Majesty. The privileged position of the Catholic Church in the Czech kingdom was firmly established after the Battle of White Mountain in 1620. Gradually freedom of religion in Bohemian lands came to an end and Protestants fled or were expelled from the country. A devout Catholic, Emperor Ferdinand II forcibly converted Austrian and Bohemian Protestants.

In the meantime, in Germany Philip Melanchthon drafted the Augsburg Confession as a common confession for the Lutherans and the free territories. It was presented to Charles V in 1530.

In the Holy Roman Empire, Charles V agreed to tolerate Lutheranism in 1555 at the Peace of Augsburg. Each state was to take the religion of its prince, but within those states, there was not necessarily religious tolerance. Citizens of other faiths could relocate to a more hospitable environment.

In France, from the 1550s, many attempts to reconcile Catholics and Protestants and to establish tolerance failed because the State was too weak to enforce them. It took the victory of prince Henry IV of France, who had converted into Protestantism, and his accession to the throne, to impose religious tolerance formalized in the Edict of Nantes in 1598. It would remain in force for over 80 years until its revocation in 1685 by Louis XIV of France. Intolerance remained the norm until Louis XVI, who signed the Edict of Versailles (1787), then the constitutional text of 24 December 1789, granting civilian rights to Protestants. The French Revolution then abolished state religion and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789) guarantees freedom of religion, as long as religious activities do not infringe on public order in ways detrimental to society.

===Early laws and legal guarantees for religious freedom===

====Principality of Transylvania====

In 1558, the Hungarian Diet&#x27;s Edict of Torda declared free practice of both Catholicism and Lutheranism. Calvinism, however, was prohibited. Calvinism was included among the accepted religions in 1564. Ten years after the first law, in 1568, the same Diet, under the chairmanship of King of Hungary, and Prince of Transylvania John Sigismund Zápolya (John II), following the teaching of Ferenc Dávid, the founder of the Unitarian Church of Transylvania, extended the freedom to all religions, declaring that &quot;It is not allowed to anybody to intimidate anybody with captivity or expelling for his religion&quot;.

Four religions (Catholicism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, Unitarianism) were named as accepted religions (religo recepta), having their representatives in the Transylvanian Diet, while the other religions, like the Orthodoxs, Sabbatarians and Anabaptists were tolerated churches (religio tolerata), which meant that they had no power in the law making and no veto rights in the Diet, but they were not persecuted in any way. Thanks to the Edict of Torda, from the last decades of the 16th century Transylvania was the only place in Europe, where so many religions could live together in harmony and without persecution.

This religious freedom ended however for some of the religions of Transylvania in 1638. After this year the Sabbatarians began to be persecuted and forced to convert to one of the accepted Christian religions of Transylvania.

====Habsburg rule in Transylvania====
The Unitarians (despite being one of the &quot;accepted religions&quot;) started to be put under an ever-growing pressure, which culminated after the Habsburg conquest of Transylvania (1691), Also after the Habsburg occupation, the new Austrian masters forced in the middle of the 18th century the Hutterite Anabaptists (who found a safe haven in 1621 in Transylvania, after the persecution to which they were subjected in the Austrian provinces and Moravia) to convert to Catholicism or to migrate in another country, which finally the Anabaptists did, leaving Transylvania and Hungary for Wallachia, then from there to Russia, and finally in the United States.

====Netherlands====
In the Union of Utrecht (20 January 1579), personal freedom of religion was declared in the struggle between the Northern Netherlands and Spain. The Union of Utrecht was an important step in the establishment of the Dutch Republic (from 1581 to 1795). Under Calvinist leadership, the Netherlands became the most tolerant country in Europe. It granted asylum to persecuted religious minorities, such as the Huguenots, the Dissenters, and the Jews who had been expelled from Spain and Portugal. The establishment of a Jewish community in the Netherlands and New Amsterdam (present-day New York) during the Dutch Republic is an example of religious freedom. When New Amsterdam surrendered to the English in 1664, freedom of religion was guaranteed in the Articles of Capitulation. It benefitted also the Jews who had landed on Manhattan Island in 1654, fleeing Portuguese persecution in Brazil. During the 18th century, other Jewish communities were established in Newport, Rhode Island, Philadelphia, Charleston, Savannah, and Richmond.

Intolerance of dissident forms of Protestantism also continued, as evidenced by the exodus of the Pilgrims, who sought refuge, first in the Netherlands, and ultimately in America, founding Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts in 1620. William Penn, the founder of Philadelphia, was involved in a case which had a profound effect on future American laws and those of England. In a classic case of jury nullification, the jury refused to convict William Penn of preaching a Quaker sermon, which was illegal. Even though the jury was imprisoned for their acquittal, they stood by their decision and helped establish the freedom of religion.

====Poland====

The General Charter of Jewish Liberties known as the Statute of Kalisz was issued by the Duke of Greater Poland Boleslaus the Pious on 8 September 1264 in Kalisz. The statute served as the basis for the legal position of Jews in Poland and led to the creation of the Yiddish-speaking autonomous Jewish nation until 1795. The statute granted exclusive jurisdiction of Jewish courts over Jewish matters and established a separate tribunal for matters involving Christians and Jews. Additionally, it guaranteed personal liberties and safety for Jews including freedom of religion, travel, and trade. The statute was ratified by subsequent Polish Kings: Casimir III of Poland in 1334, Casimir IV of Poland in 1453 and Sigismund I of Poland in 1539. Poland freed Jews from direct royal authority, opening up enormous administrative and economic opportunities to them.

====Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth====

The right to worship freely was a basic right given to all inhabitants of the future Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth throughout the 15th and early 16th century, however, complete freedom of religion was officially recognized in 1573 during the Warsaw Confederation. Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth kept religious freedom laws during an era when religious persecution was an everyday occurrence in the rest of Europe.

===United States===

Most of the New England colonies in British Colonial America were generally not tolerant of dissident forms of worship, with Maryland being one of the exceptions. For example, Roger Williams found it necessary to found a new colony in Rhode Island to escape persecution in the theocratically dominated colony of Massachusetts. The Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony were the most active of the New England persecutors of Quakers, and the persecuting spirit was shared by Plymouth Colony and the colonies along the Connecticut River. In 1660, one of the most notable victims of religious intolerance was an English Quaker Mary Dyer, who was hanged in Boston, Massachusetts for repeatedly defying a Puritan law banning Quakers from the colony. As one of the four executed Quakers known as the Boston martyrs, the hanging of Dyer on the Boston gallows marked the beginning of the end of the Puritan theocracy and New England independence from English rule, and in 1661 King Charles II explicitly forbade Massachusetts from executing anyone for professing Quakerism. Anti-Catholic sentiment appeared in New England with the first Pilgrim and Puritan settlers. In 1647, Massachusetts passed a law prohibiting any Jesuit Roman Catholic priests from entering territory under Puritan jurisdiction. Any suspected person who could not clear himself was to be banished from the colony; a second offense carried a death penalty. The Pilgrims of New England held radical Protestant disapproval of Christmas. Christmas observance was outlawed in Boston in 1659. The ban by the Puritans was revoked in 1681 by an English appointed governor, however, it was not until the mid-19th century that celebrating Christmas became common in the Boston region.

Freedom of religion was first applied as a principle of government in the founding of the colony of Maryland, founded by the Catholic Lord Baltimore, in 1634. Fifteen years later (1649), the Maryland Toleration Act, drafted by Lord Baltimore, provided: &quot;No person or persons...shall from henceforth be any way troubled, molested or discountenanced for or in respect of his or her religion nor in the free exercise thereof.&quot; The Act allowed freedom of worship for all Trinitarian Christians in Maryland, but sentenced to death anyone who denied the divinity of Jesus. The Maryland Toleration Act was repealed during the Cromwellian Era with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen and a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion was passed. In 1657, the Catholic Lord Baltimore regained control after making a deal with the colony&#x27;s Protestants, and in 1658 the Act was again passed by the colonial assembly. This time, it would last more than thirty years, until 1692 when, after Maryland&#x27;s Protestant Revolution of 1689, freedom of religion was again rescinded. In addition, in 1704, an Act was passed &quot;to prevent the growth of Popery in this Province&quot;, preventing Catholics from holding political office. Full religious toleration would not be restored in Maryland until the American Revolution, when Maryland&#x27;s Charles Carroll of Carrollton signed the American Declaration of Independence.

Rhode Island (1636), Connecticut (1636), New Jersey, and Pennsylvania (1682) founded by Protestants Roger Williams, Thomas Hooker, and William Penn, respectively combined the democratic form of government which had been developed by the Puritans and the Separatist Congregationalists in Massachusetts with religious freedom. These colonies became sanctuaries for persecuted religious minorities. Catholics and, later on, Jews also had full citizenship and free exercise of their religions. Williams, Hooker, Penn, and their friends were firmly convinced that freedom of conscience was the will of God. Williams gave the most profound argument: As faith is the free work of the Holy Spirit, it cannot be forced on a person. Therefore, strict separation of church and state has to be kept. Pennsylvania was the only colony that retained unlimited religious freedom until the foundation of the United States in 1776. It was the inseparable connection between democracy, religious freedom, and other forms of freedom which became the political and legal basis of the new nation. In particular, Baptists and Presbyterians demanded the disestablishment of state churches Anglican and Congregationalist and the protection of religious freedom.
Reiterating Maryland&#x27;s and the other colonies&#x27; earlier colonial legislation, the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, written in 1779 by Thomas Jefferson, proclaimed:
[N]o man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.

Those sentiments also found expression in the First Amendment of the national constitution, part of the United States&#x27; Bill of Rights: &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...&quot;. The acknowledgement of religious freedom as the first right protected in the Bill of Rights points toward the American founders&#x27; understanding of the importance of religion to human, social, and political flourishing. The First Amendment makes clear that it sought to protect &quot;the free exercise&quot; of religion, or what might be called &quot;free exercise equality.&quot;

The United States formally considers religious freedom in its foreign relations. The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 established the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom which investigates the records of over 200 other nations with respect to religious freedom, and makes recommendations to submit nations with egregious records to ongoing scrutiny and possible economic sanctions. Many human rights organizations have urged the United States to be still more vigorous in imposing sanctions on countries that do not permit or tolerate religious freedom.

===Canada===

Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing believers the freedom to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. Canadian law goes further, requiring that private citizens and companies provide reasonable accommodation to those, for example, with strong religious beliefs. The Canadian Human Rights Act allows an exception to reasonable accommodation with respect to religious dress, such as a Sikh turban, when there is a &quot;bona fide&quot; occupational requirement, such as a workplace requiring a hard hat. In 2017 the Santo Daime Church Céu do Montréal received religious exemption to use Ayahuasca as a sacrament in their rituals.

===International===
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares that:

On 25 November 1981, the United Nations General Assembly passed the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. This declaration recognizes freedom of religion as a fundamental human right in accordance with several other instruments of international law.

However, the most substantial binding legal instruments that guarantee the right to freedom of religion that was passed by the international community is the Convention on the Rights of the Child which states in its Article 14: &quot;States Parties shall respect the right of the child to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. States Parties shall respect the rights and duties of the parents and, when applicable, legal guardians, to provide direction to the child in the exercise of his or her right in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child. Freedom to manifest one&#x27;s religion or beliefs may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others.&quot;

There exists a United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief.

==Contemporary debates==
===Theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs===
In 1993, the UN&#x27;s human rights committee declared that article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights &quot;protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief.&quot; The committee further stated that &quot;the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, including the right to replace one&#x27;s current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic views.&quot; Signatories to the convention are barred from &quot;the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers&quot; to recant their beliefs or convert. Despite this, minority religions still are persecuted in many parts of the world.

===Non-religious people===

In 2012, the organizations American Humanist Association, Center for Inquiry, Humanists International, Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science and Secular Coalition for America worked together on a joint report: the &quot;2012 Report on Discrimination Against Atheists, Humanists and the Non-Religious&quot;. In December, on Human Rights Day, Humanists International launched a new edition for an international audience: &quot;Freedom of Thought 2012: A Global Report on Discrimination against Humanists, Atheists and the Non-Religious&quot;. It is now called &quot;The Freedom of Thought Report&quot; and examines every country in the world for its record on upholding the rights and equality for non-religious people.

===Secular liberalism===

The French philosopher Voltaire noted in his book on English society, &quot;Letters on the English&quot;, that freedom of religion in a diverse society was deeply important to maintaining peace in that country. It was also important to understand why England at that time was more prosperous in comparison to the country&#x27;s less religiously tolerant European neighbours. If one religion only were allowed in England, the Government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut one another’s throats; but as there are such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace.Adam Smith, in his book &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; (using an argument first put forward by his friend and contemporary David Hume), states that in the long run it is in the best interests of society as a whole and the civil magistrate (government) in particular to allow people to freely choose their own religion, as it helps prevent civil unrest and reduces intolerance. So long as there are enough religions and/or religious sects operating freely in a society then they are all compelled to moderate their more controversial and violent teachings, so as to be more appealing to more people and so have an easier time attracting new converts. It is this free competition amongst religious sects for converts that ensures stability and tranquillity in the long run.

Smith also points out that laws that prevent religious freedom and seek to preserve the power and belief in a particular religion will, in the long run, only serve to weaken and corrupt that religion, as its leaders and preachers become complacent, disconnected and unpractised in their ability to seek and win over new converts:

===Judaism===

Judaism includes multiple streams, such as Orthodox, Reform Judaism, Conservative Judaism, Reconstructionist Judaism, Jewish Renewal and Humanistic Judaism. However, Judaism also exists in many forms as a civilization, possessing characteristics known as peoplehood, rather than strictly as a religion. In the Torah, Jews are forbidden to practice idolatry and are commanded to root out pagan and idolatrous practices within their midst, including killing idolaters who sacrifice children to their gods or engage in immoral activities. However, these laws are not adhered to anymore as Jews have usually lived among multi-religious communities.

After the conquest of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judea by the Roman Empire, a Jewish state did not exist until 1948 with the establishment of the State of Israel. For over 1500 years Jewish people lived under pagan, Christian, Muslim, etc. rule. As such Jewish people in some of these states faced persecution. From the pogroms in Europe during the Middle Ages to the establishment of segregated Jewish ghettos during World War II. In the Middle East, Jews were categorised as dhimmi, and non-Muslims were permitted to live within a Muslim state. Even though given rights within a Muslim state, a dhimmi is still not equal to a Muslim within Muslim society.

The State of Israel was established as a Jewish and democratic state after World War II. While the Israeli Declaration of Independence stresses religious freedom as a fundamental principle, in practice, most of Israel&#x27;s governments have depended on ultra-Orthodox parties and have instituted legal barriers that applied to all Jews, regardless of whether they practised Orthodox Judaism. However, as a nation-state, Israel is very open towards other religions and religious practices, including a public Muslim call to prayer chants and Christian prayer bells ringing in Jerusalem. Israel has been evaluated in research by the Pew organization as having &quot;high&quot; government restrictions on religion. The government recognizes only Orthodox Judaism in certain matters of personal status, and marriages can only be performed by religious authorities. The government provides the greatest funding to Orthodox Judaism, even though adherents represent a minority of citizens. Jewish women, including Anat Hoffman, have been arrested at the Western Wall for praying and singing while wearing religious garments the Orthodox feel should be reserved for men. Women of the Wall have organized to promote religious freedom at the Wall. In November 2014, a group of 60 non-Orthodox rabbinical students were told they would not be allowed to pray in the Knesset synagogue because it is reserved for Orthodox. Rabbi Joel Levy, director of the Conservative Yeshiva in Jerusalem, said that he had submitted the request on behalf of the students and saw their shock when the request was denied. He noted: &quot;Paradoxically, this decision served as an appropriate end to our conversation about religion and state in Israel.&quot; MK Dov Lipman expressed the concern that many Knesset workers are unfamiliar with non-Orthodox and American practices and would view &quot;an egalitarian service in the synagogue as an affront.&quot; The non-Orthodox forms of Jewish practice function independently in Israel, except for these issues of praying at the Western Wall.

A January 2022 report by IMPACT-se, an Israeli non-profit, detailed the amount of religious tolerance impressed on students through the education system in the United Arab Emirates. The &quot;Jews as a Religious Community&quot; section of the report starts with the UAE curriculum being cited as a tolerant one and one instilling a &quot;generally positive attitude toward other non-Muslims&quot;. However, besides the positive examples aimed at maintaining peace between the two nations, the report also highlights the negative portrayal of Jews in the UAE, citing a hadith passage that preaches believers to not be like the Jews, as they may be unclean or dirty. An Islamic educational text further described punishing the Bani Qurayza Jews for purportedly abusing their commitment to supporting Muhammad. The textbooks also seem to have missed mentioning Israel in their maps or educating the children about the Jewish state&#x27;s history, i.e. the event of Holocaust despite normalizing ties with the Jewish state.

===Christianity===
Some Orthodox Christians, especially those living in democratic countries, support religious freedom for all, as evidenced by the position of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Many Protestant Christian churches, including some Baptists, Churches of Christ, Seventh-day Adventist Church and main line churches have a commitment to religious freedoms. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also affirms religious freedom.

However others, such as African scholar Makau Mutua, have argued that Christian insistence on the propagation of their faith to native cultures as an element of religious freedom has resulted in a corresponding denial of religious freedom to native traditions and led to their destruction. As he states in the book produced by the Oslo Coalition on Freedom of Religion or Belief, &quot;Imperial religions have necessarily violated individual conscience and the communal expressions of Africans and their communities by subverting African religions.&quot;

In their book &quot;Breaking India&quot;, Hindutva ideologue Rajiv Malhotra and Aravindan Neelakandan discussed the &quot;US Protestant Church&quot; funding activities in India, with the book arguing that the funds collected were being used not so much for the purposes indicated to sponsors, but for indoctrination and conversion activities. They suggest that India is the prime target of a huge enterprise a &quot;network&quot; of organizations, individuals, and churches that, they argue, seem intensely devoted to the task of creating a separatist identity, history, and even religion for the vulnerable sections of India. They suggest that this nexus of players includes not only church groups, government bodies, and related organizations, but also private think tanks and academics.

Joel Spring has written about the Christianization of the Roman Empire:

Christianity added new impetus to the expansion of empire. Increasing the arrogance of the imperial project, Christians insisted that the Gospels and the Church were the only valid sources of religious beliefs. Imperialists could claim that they were both civilizing the world and spreading the true religion. By the 5th century, Christianity was thought of as co-extensive with the &quot;Imperium romanum&quot;. This meant that to be human, as opposed to being a natural slave, was to be &quot;civilized&quot; and Christian. Historian Anthony Pagden argues, &quot;just as the &quot;civitas&quot;; had now become coterminous with Christianity, so to be human to be, that is, one who was &#x27;civil&#x27;, and who was able to interpret correctly the law of nature one had now also to be Christian.&quot; After the fifteenth century, most Western colonialists rationalized the spread of empire with the belief that they were saving a barbaric and pagan world by spreading Christian civilization.

====Catholicism====

Prior to Vatican Council II, the Catholic Church persecuted other religions. European Catholics, especially during the Inquisition and Crusades in the middle ages, killed Jews, Muslims, pagans, and Christians of different denominations and destroyed non-Christian and non-Catholic Christian religious art, books, and places of worship. In the colonial era of the United States, American Catholics forced Native Americans to convert to Catholicism and destroyed their religious art and places of worship. In 1864, Pope Pius IX had written a document called the &quot;Syllabus of Errors,&quot;which - made up of phrases and paraphrases from earlier papal documents, along with index references to them, and presented as a list of &quot;condemned propositions&quot; - condemned belief in universal religious freedom, claiming that non-Catholics do not have the right to practice their own religions and types of worship. In 1892, the church agreed with Thomas Aquinas on his policy of religious tolerance. In 2000, Pope John Paul II apologized on behalf of the church for its past sins, making special mention of religious persecution.

According to the Vatican II document on religious freedom, &quot;Dignitatis Humanae&quot;, &quot;the human person has a right to religious freedom&quot;, which is described as &quot;immunity from coercion in civil society&quot;. This principle of religious freedom &quot;leaves untouched traditional Catholic doctrine on the moral duty of men and societies toward the true religion.&quot; In addition, this right &quot;is to be recognized in the constitutional law whereby society is governed and thus it is to become a civil right.&quot; According to &quot;Dignitatis Humanae&quot; and the Catechism of the Catholic Church, every religion has the right to exist and to be publicly and privately practiced (including the right to be spread and to make converts), no religion must be denied the right to worship according to its own beliefs and practices, every person and group has the right to be religious or nonreligious and to change from one to the other, no person or group must be forced to be good but their right to conscience must be respected, every person and group has the right to its own culture and art, no religion must be used for sin nor any sin committed in the name of God or religion, and every religion and adherent must be treated as humanely as every other group and person in the world (especially when one religion is predominate or given special civil recognition). The catechism explains that, as the one true religion founded by the one true God, the Catholic Church has the right and duty to protect every individual&#x27;s individual right to religious liberty. While the church believes idolatry is a sin, the church does not believe idolatry should be made illegal, since the criminalization of all or even most sins is the sin of coercion. Regarding the church&#x27;s past sins, the catechism condemns Jewish deicide and makes reference to ecclesiastical torture and capital punishment.

===Islam===
Conversion to Islam is simple and according to Al-Baqara 256 &quot;there is no compulsion in religion&quot;. Certain Muslim-majority countries are known for their restrictions on religious freedom, highly favoring Muslim citizens over non-Muslim citizens. Other countries having the same restrictive laws tend to be more liberal when imposing them. Even other Muslim-majority countries are secular and thus do not regulate religious belief.

In Iran, the constitution recognizes four religions whose status is formally protected: Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
The constitution, however, also set the groundwork for the institutionalized persecution of Baháʼís, who have been subjected to arrests, beatings, executions, confiscation and destruction of property, and the denial of civil rights and liberties, and the denial of access to higher education. There is no freedom of conscience in Iran, as converting from Islam to any other religion is forbidden.

In Egypt, a 16 December 2006 judgment of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt created a clear demarcation between recognized religions Islam, Christianity and Judaism and all other religious beliefs; no other religious affiliation is officially admissible. The ruling leaves members of other religious communities, including Baháʼís, without the ability to obtain the necessary government documents to have rights in their country, essentially denying them of all rights of citizenship. They cannot obtain ID cards, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, and passports; they also cannot be employed, educated, treated in public hospitals or vote, among other things. See Egyptian identification card controversy.

===Changing religion===
Among the most contentious areas of religious freedom is the right of an individual to change or abandon his or her own religion, criminalized as apostasy in some countries, and the right to evangelize individuals seeking to convince others to make such a change.

Other debates have centered around restricting certain kinds of missionary activity by religions. Many Islamic states, and others such as China, severely restrict missionary activities of other religions. Greece, among European countries, has generally looked unfavorably on missionary activities of denominations others than the majority church and proselytizing is constitutionally prohibited.

A different kind of critique of the freedom to propagate religion has come from non-Abrahamic traditions such as the African and Indian. African scholar Makau Mutua criticizes religious evangelism on the ground of cultural annihilation by what he calls &quot;proselytizing universalist faiths&quot; (Chapter 28: Proselytism and Cultural Integrity, p. 652):

Some Indian scholars have similarly argued that the right to propagate religion is not culturally or religiously neutral.

In Sri Lanka, there have been debates regarding a bill on religious freedom that seeks to protect indigenous religious traditions from certain kinds of missionary activities. Debates have also occurred in various states of India regarding similar laws, particularly those that restrict conversions using force, fraud or allurement.

In 2008, Christian Solidarity Worldwide, a Christian human rights non-governmental organisation which specializes in religious freedom, launched an in-depth report on the human rights abuses faced by individuals who leave Islam for another religion. The report is the product of a year long research project in six countries. It calls on Muslim nations, the international community, the UN and the international media to resolutely address the serious violations of human rights suffered by apostates.

====Apostasy in Islam====
In Islam, apostasy is called &quot;ridda&quot; (&quot;turning back&quot;) and is considered to be a profound insult to God. A person born of Muslim parents that rejects Islam is called a &quot;&quot;murtadd fitri&quot; (natural apostate), and a person that converted to Islam and later rejects the religion is called a &quot;murtadd milli&quot;&quot; (apostate from the community).

A female apostate must be either executed, according to Shafi&#x27;i, Maliki, and Hanbali schools of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh), or imprisoned until she reverts to Islam as advocated by the Sunni Hanafi school and by Shi&#x27;a scholars.

Ideally, the one performing the execution of an apostate must be an imam. At the same time, all schools of Islamic jurisprudence agree that any Muslim can kill an apostate without punishment.

However, while almost all scholars agree about the punishment, many disagree on the allowable time to retract the apostasy. S. A. Rahman, a former Chief Justice of Pakistan, argues that there is no indication of the death penalty for apostasy in the Qur&#x27;an.

Javed Ahmad Ghamidi a prominent Islamic scholar who studied under Syed Abul Ala Maududi &amp; Amin Ahsan Islahi, says killing of apostates was only for a special period after the Itmam e Hujjat.

====Children&#x27;s rights====
The law in Germany includes the concept of &quot;religious maturity&quot; (&quot;Religiöse Mündigkeit&quot;) with a minimum age for minors to follow their own religious beliefs even if their parents don&#x27;t share those or don&#x27;t approve. Children 14 and older have the unrestricted right to enter or exit any religious community. Children 12 and older cannot be compelled to change to a different belief. Children 10 and older have to be heard before their parents change their religious upbringing to a different belief. There are similar laws in Austria and in Switzerland.

===Secular law===
Religious practice may also conflict with secular law, creating debates on religious freedom. For instance, even though polygamy is permitted in Islam, it is prohibited in secular law in many countries. This raises the question of whether prohibiting the practice infringes on the beliefs of certain Muslims. The US and India, both constitutionally secular nations, have taken two views of this. In India, polygamy is permitted, but only for Muslims, under Muslim Personal Law. In the US, polygamy is prohibited for all. This was a major source of conflict between the US government and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in its early days, and the United States until the Church amended its position on practicing polygamy.

Similar issues have also arisen in the context of the religious use of psychedelic substances by Native American tribes in the United States, such as by the Native American Church.

In 1955, Chief Justice of California Roger J. Traynor neatly summarized the American position on how freedom of religion cannot imply freedom from law: &quot;Although freedom of conscience and the freedom to believe are absolute, the freedom to act is not.&quot; But with respect to the religious use of animals within secular law and those acts, the US Supreme Court decision in the case of the &quot;Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah&quot; in 1993 upheld the right of Santeria adherents to practice ritual animal sacrifice, with Justice Anthony Kennedy stating in the decision: &quot;religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection&quot; (quoted by Justice Kennedy from the opinion by Justice Burger in &quot;Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division&quot; ).

In 1962, the case of &quot;Engel v. Vitale&quot; went to court over the violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment resulting from a mandatory nondenominational prayer in New York public schools. The Supreme Court ruled in opposition to the state.

In 1963, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of &quot;Abington School District v. Schempp&quot;. Edward Schempp sued the school district in Abington over the Pennsylvania law which required students to hear and sometimes read portions of the bible for their daily education. The court ruled in favor of Schempp and the Pennsylvania law was overturned.

In 1968, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of &quot;Epperson v. Arkansas&quot;. Susan Epperson, a high school teacher in Arkansas sued over a violation of religious freedom. The state had a law banning the teaching of evolution and the school Epperson worked for had provided curriculum which contained evolutionary theory. Epperson had to choose between violating the law or losing her job. The Supreme Court ruled to overturn the Arkansas law because it was unconstitutional.

====As a legal form of discrimination====
Leaders of the Christian right in the United States, United Kingdom, and other nations frame their opposition to LGBT rights and reproductive freedom as a defence of religious liberty.

The Catholic Church does not believe it unjustly discriminates against anyone, but justly discriminates against sin, by obeying God.

In court cases, religious adherents have argued that they need exemptions from laws requiring equal treatment of LGBT people to avoid being complicit in &quot;the sinful behaviour&quot; of LGBT people. Moreover, other Christians argue that LGBT rights must be entirely removed from law to preserve the religious liberty of conservative Christians. As pointed out at the United Nations Human Rights Council in the 2023 formal report of the United Nations Independent Expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity on the basis of the explanation in a 2020 article by human rights expert Dag Øistein Endsjø, adherents of denominations and belief systems who embrace LGBT-equality &quot;can claim that anti-LGBT manifestations of religion (such as criminalization and discrimination) not only impinge upon the right of LGBT people to be free from violence and discrimination based on SOGI [sexual orientation and gender identity], but also violate the denominations&#x27; own rights of freedom of religion&quot;.

In 2015, Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk, refused to abide by the Supreme Court decision in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; legalising same-sex marriage in the United States. When she refused to issue marriage licences, she became embroiled in the &quot;Miller v. Davis&quot; lawsuit. Her actions caused attorney and author Roberta Kaplan to claim that &quot;Kim Davis is the clearest example of someone who wants to use a religious liberty argument to discriminate.&quot; Davis was briefly jailed and Kentucky court ordered her to pay the same-sex couple $100,000 in damages.

==International Religious Freedom Day==
27 October is International Religious Freedom Day, in commemoration of the execution of the Boston martyrs, a group of Quakers executed by the Puritans on Boston Common for their religious beliefs under the legislature of the Massachusetts Bay Colony between 1659 and 1661. On October 27, 1553, Michael Servetus was burned alive for heresy in Geneva. On October 27, 1998, President Bill Clinton signed the International Religious Freedom Act.

==Modern concerns==

The International Religious Freedom or Belief Alliance (IRFBA) is a network of countries promoting freedom of religion or belief (FoRB) worldwide.

There exists an International Panel of Parliamentarians for Freedom of Religion or Belief.

Religious freedom is measured in the non-profit organization Freedom House&#x27;s annual report, &quot;Freedom in the World&quot;.

In its 2011 annual report, the &quot;United States Commission on International Religious Freedom&quot; designated fourteen nations as &quot;countries of particular concern&quot;. The commission chairman commented that these are nations whose conduct marks them as the world&#x27;s worst religious freedom violators and human rights abusers. The fourteen nations designated were Burma, China, Egypt, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Other nations on the commission&#x27;s watchlist include Afghanistan, Belarus, Cuba, India, Indonesia, Laos, Russia, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Venezuela.

There are concerns about the restrictions on public religious dress in some European countries (including the Hijab, Kippah, and Christian cross). Article 18 of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights limits restrictions on freedom to manifest one&#x27;s religion or beliefs to those necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others. Freedom of religion as a legal concept is related to, but not identical with, religious toleration, separation of church and state, or secular state (&quot;laïcité&quot;).

===Social hostilities and government restrictions===

The Pew Research Center has performed studies on international religious freedom between 2009 and 2015, compiling global data from 16 governmental and non-governmental organizationsincluding the United Nations, the United States State Department, and Human Rights Watchand representing over 99.5 percent of the world&#x27;s population. In 2009, nearly 70 percent of the world&#x27;s population lived in countries classified as having heavy restrictions on freedom of religion. This concerns restrictions on religion originating from government prohibitions on free speech and religious expression as well as social hostilities undertaken by private individuals, organisations and social groups. Social hostilities were classified by the level of communal violence and religion-related terrorism.

While most countries provided for the protection of religious freedom in their constitutions or laws, only a quarter of those countries were found to fully respect these legal rights in practice. In 75 countries, governments limit the efforts of religious groups to proselytise, and in 178 countries, religious groups must register with the government. In 2013, Pew classified 30% of countries as having restrictions that tend to target religious minorities, and 61% of countries have social hostilities that tend to target religious minorities.

The countries in North and South America reportedly had some of the lowest levels of &quot;government&quot; and &quot;social&quot; restrictions on religion, while The Middle East and North Africa were the regions with the highest. Saudi Arabia and Iran were the countries that top the list of countries with the &quot;overall&quot; highest levels of restriction on religion. Topping the Pew government restrictions index were Saudi Arabia, Iran, Uzbekistan, China, Egypt, Burma, Maldives, Eritrea, Malaysia and Brunei.

Of the world&#x27;s 25 most populous countries, Iran, Egypt, Indonesia and Pakistan had the most restrictions, while Brazil, Japan, Italy, South Africa, the UK, and the US had some of the lowest levels, as measured by Pew.

Vietnam and China were classified as having high &quot;government&quot; restrictions on religion but were in the moderate or low range when it came to &quot;social&quot; hostilities. Nigeria, Bangladesh and India were high in &quot;social&quot; hostilities but moderate in terms of &quot;government&quot; actions.

Restrictions on religion across the world increased between mid-2009 and mid-2010, according to a 2012 study by the Pew Research Center. Restrictions in each of the five major regions of the world increasedincluding in the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa, the two regions where overall restrictions previously had been declining. In 2010, Egypt, Nigeria, the Palestinian territories, Russia, and Yemen were added to the &quot;very high&quot; category of social hostilities. The five highest social hostility scores were for Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Iraq, and Bangladesh. In 2015, Pew published that social hostilities declined in 2013, but the harassment of Jews increased.

In the Palestinian territories, Palestinians face tight restrictions on practicing the freedom of religion due to the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In a report published by the Geneva-based Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, eyewitnesses reported systematic practices aiming at preventing young men and women from performing their prayers at Masjid Al-Aqsa. These practices include military orders issued by the Israeli Defense Army commander against specific Palestinians who have an effective role in Jerusalem, interrogating young men, and creating a secret blacklist of people who are prevented from entering the Al-Aqsa Mosque.

The lack of religious freedom in China has led to Uyghur Muslims fleeing the country to take refuge in other parts of the world. Uyghurs abroad encounter digital surveillance and intimidation, where their families in China are sometimes being used as leverage. The diplomatic relations of Beijing have resulted in the abuse and detention of Uyghur Muslims even in abroad. Along with Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the government of UAE was reportedly one of the three Arab nations to have detained and deported Uyghur Muslims living in asylum in Dubai, back to China. The decision received a lot of criticism due to China&#x27;s poor human rights records and no extradition agreement shared between the two countries. Thailand and Turkey also have detained and deported Uyghurs reportedly under the pressure of the Chinese government.

According to a 2021 report of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, UN human rights experts received credible information that the Chinese government continues to engage in forced organ harvesting against religious minorities such as Uyghurs and Falun Gong practitioners and the organs most likely harvested include “hearts, kidneys, livers, corneas and, less commonly, parts of livers.”

Raif Badawi, the Saudi blogger who was detained for 10 years and received 1,000 lashes in public in 2014, was released on 11 March 2022. The information of Raif&#x27;s release was shared by his Quebec-based wife, Ensaf Haidar after she received a call from him. The Saudi blogger was fined, jailed, and flogged for criticizing his country&#x27;s clerics through his writings. However, besides the said punishment, a 10-year passport ban was also imposed on Raif, restricting him from traveling outside Saudi Arabia. Reporters Without Borders claimed that they would work in order to get the travel ban removed to help Raif join his family in Canada.

<text>Moldavia (, or ; in Romanian Cyrillic: or ) is a historical region and former principality in Central and Eastern Europe, corresponding to the territory between the Eastern Carpathians and the Dniester River. An initially independent and later autonomous state, it existed from the 14th century to 1859, when it united with Wallachia () as the basis of the modern Romanian state; at various times, Moldavia included the regions of Bessarabia (with the Budjak), all of Bukovina and Hertsa. The region of Pokuttya was also part of it for a period of time.

The western half of Moldavia is now part of Romania, the eastern side belongs to the Republic of Moldova, and the northern and southeastern parts are territories of Ukraine.

==Name and etymology==
The original and short-lived reference to the region was &quot;Bogdania&quot;, after Bogdan I, the founding figure of the principality.

The names &quot;Moldavia&quot; and &quot;Moldova&quot; are derived from the name of the Moldova River; however, the etymology is not known and there are several variants:
* A legend mentioned in &quot;Descriptio Moldaviae&quot; (1714–1716) by Dimitrie Cantemir links it to an aurochs hunting trip of the voivode of the Voivodeship of Maramureș Dragoș and the latter&#x27;s chase of a star-marked aurochs. Dragoș was accompanied by his female hound, called &quot;Molda&quot;; when they reached the shores of an unfamiliar river, Molda caught up with the animal and was killed by it. The dog&#x27;s name would have been combined with the Romanian word for water, , and given to the river and extended to the country.
* the Gothic (, ) meaning &#x27;dust&#x27;, &#x27;dirt&#x27; (cognate with the English &quot;mould&quot;), referring to the river.
* A Slavic etymology ( is a quite common Slavic suffix), marking the end of one Slavic genitive form, denoting ownership, chiefly of feminine nouns (i.e., &#x27;that of Molda&#x27;).
* A landowner named Alexa Moldaowicz is mentioned in a 1334 document as a local boyar in service to Yuriy II of Halych; this attests to the use of the name before the foundation of the Moldavian state and could be the source for the region&#x27;s name.

On a series of coins of Peter I and Stephen I minted by Saxon masters and with German legends, the reverses feature the name of Moldavia in the form / (recte: ).

In several early references, &quot;Moldavia&quot; is rendered under the composite form &quot;Moldo-Wallachia&quot; (in the same way Wallachia may appear as &quot;Hungro-Wallachia&quot;). Ottoman Turkish references to Moldavia included (, meaning &#x27;Bogdan&#x27;s Wallachia&#x27;) and (and occasionally , , &quot;Black Bogdania&quot;). See also names in other languages.

The names of the region in other languages include , , , (), , .

==History==

===Prehistory and antiquity===
===Early Middle Ages===
The inhabitants of Moldavia were Christians. Archaeological works revealed the remains of a Christian necropolis at Mihălășeni, Botoșani county, from the 5th century. The place of worship, and the tombs had Christian characteristics. The place of worship had a rectangular form with sides of eight and seven meters. Similar necropolises and places of worship were found at Nicolina, in Iași

The Bolohoveni are mentioned by the &quot;Hypatian Chronicle&quot; in the 13th century. The chronicle shows that this land is bordered on the principalities of Halych, Volhynia and Kiev. Archaeological research also identified the location of 13th-century fortified settlements in this region. Alexandru V. Boldur identified Voscodavie, Voscodavti, Voloscovti, Volcovti, Volosovca and their other towns and villages between the middle course of the rivers Nistru/Dniester and Nipru/Dnieper. The Bolohoveni disappeared from chronicles after their defeat in 1257 by Daniel of Galicia&#x27;s troops. Their ethnic identity is uncertain; although Romanian scholars, basing on their ethnonym identify them as Romanians (who were called Vlachs in the Middle Ages), archeological evidence and the &quot;Hypatian Chronicle&quot; (which is the only primary source that documents their history) suggest that they were a Slavic people.

In the early 13th century, the &quot;Brodniks&quot;, a possible Slavic–Vlach vassal state of Halych, were present, alongside the Vlachs, in much of the region&#x27;s territory (towards 1216, the Brodniks are mentioned as in service of Suzdal).

Somewhere in the 11th century, a Viking named Rodfos was killed by Vlachs presumably in the area of what would become Moldavia. In 1164, the future Byzantine emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, was taken prisoner by Vlach shepherds in the same region.

The Franciscan Friar William of Rubruck, who visited the court of the Great Khan in the 1250s, listed &quot;the Blac&quot;, or Vlachs, among the peoples who paid tribute to the Mongols, but the Vlachs&#x27; territory is uncertain. Friar William described &quot;Blakia&quot; as &quot;Assan&#x27;s territory&quot; south of the Lower Danube, showing that he identified it with the northern regions of the Second Bulgarian Empire.
Later in the 14th century, King Charles I of Hungary attempted to expand his realm and the influence of the Catholic Church eastwards after the fall of Cuman rule, and ordered a campaign under the command of Phynta de Mende (1324). In 1342 and 1345, the Hungarians were victorious in a battle against Tatar-Mongols; the conflict was resolved by the death of Jani Beg, in 1357. The Polish chronicler Jan Długosz mentioned Moldavians (under the name &quot;Wallachians&quot;) as having joined a military expedition in 1342, under King Władysław I, against the Margraviate of Brandenburg.

In 1353, Dragoș, mentioned as a Vlach &quot;Knyaz&quot; in Maramureș, was sent by Louis I to establish a line of defense against the Golden Horde forces of Mongols on the Siret River. This expedition resulted in a polity vassal to Hungary, in the Baia (&quot;Târgul Moldovei&quot; or &quot;Moldvabánya&quot;) region.

Bogdan of Cuhea, another Vlach voivode from Maramureș who had fallen out with the Hungarian king, crossed the Carpathians in 1359, took control of Moldavia, and succeeded in wrenching Moldavia from Hungarian control. His realm extended north to the Cheremosh River, while the southern part of Moldavia was still occupied by the Tatar Mongols.

After first residing in Baia, Bogdan moved Moldavia&#x27;s seat to Siret (it was to remain there until Petru II Mușat moved it to Suceava; it was finally moved to Iași under Alexandru Lăpușneanu - in 1565). The area around Suceava, roughly correspondent to future Bukovina, would later constitute one of the two administrative divisions of the new realm, under the name &quot;Țara de Sus&quot; (the &quot;Upper Land&quot;), whereas the rest, on both sides of the Prut river, formed &quot;Țara de Jos&quot; (the &quot;Lower Land&quot;).

Disfavored by the brief union of Angevin Poland and Hungary (the latter was still the country&#x27;s overlord), Bogdan&#x27;s successor Lațcu accepted conversion to Latin Catholicism around 1370. Despite the founding of the Latin diocese of Siret, this move did not have any lasting consequences. Despite remaining officially Eastern Orthodox and culturally connected with the Byzantine Empire after 1382, princes of the House of Bogdan-Mușat entered a conflict with the Constantinople Patriarchate about control of appointments to the newly founded Moldavian Metropolitan seat; Patriarch Antony IV even cast an anathema over Moldavia after Roman I expelled Constantinople&#x27;s candidate, sending him back to Byzantium. The crisis was finally settled in favor of the Moldavian princes under Alexander I. Nevertheless, religious policy remained complex: while conversions to faiths other than Orthodox were discouraged (and forbidden for princes), Moldavia included sizable Latin Catholic communities (Germans and Magyars), as well as Armenians of the non-Chalcedonian Armenian Apostolic Church; after 1460, the country welcomed Hussite refugees (founders of Ciuburciu and, probably, Huși).

The principality of Moldavia covered the entire geographic region of Moldavia. In various periods, various other territories were politically connected with the Moldavian principality. This is the case of the province of Pokuttya, the fiefdoms of Cetatea de Baltă and Ciceu (both in Transylvania) or, at a later date, the territories between the Dniester and the Bug rivers.

Petru II profited from the end of the Hungarian-Polish union and moved the country closer to the Jagiellonian realm, becoming a vassal of Władysław II on September 26, 1387. This gesture was to have unexpected consequences: Petru supplied the Polish ruler with funds needed in the war against the Teutonic Knights, and was granted control over Pokuttya until the debt was repaid; as this is not recorded to have been carried out, the region became disputed by the two states, until it was lost by Moldavia in the Battle of Obertyn (1531). Prince Petru also expanded his rule southwards to the Danube Delta. His brother Roman I conquered the Hungarian-ruled Cetatea Albă in 1392, giving Moldavia an outlet to the Black Sea, before being toppled from the throne for supporting Fyodor Koriatovych in his conflict with Vytautas the Great of Lithuania. Under Stephen I.

Although Alexander I was brought to the throne in 1400 by the Hungarians (with assistance from Mircea I of Wallachia), he shifted his allegiances towards Poland (notably engaging Moldavian forces on the Polish side in the Battle of Grunwald and the Siege of Marienburg), and placed his own choice of rulers in Wallachia. His reign was one of the most successful in Moldavia&#x27;s history, but also saw the first confrontation with the Ottoman Turks at Cetatea Albă in 1420, and later even a conflict with the Poles. A deep crisis was to follow Alexandru&#x27;s long reign, with his successors battling each other in a succession of wars that divided the country until the murder of Bogdan II and the ascension of Petru III Aron in 1451. Nevertheless, Moldavia was subject to further Hungarian interventions after that moment, as Matthias Corvinus deposed Aron and backed Alexăndrel to the throne in Suceava. Petru Aron&#x27;s rule also signified the beginning of Moldavia&#x27;s Ottoman Empire allegiance, as the ruler agreed to pay tribute to Sultan Mehmed II.

===Late Middle Ages===

Under Stephen the Great, who took the throne and subsequently came to an agreement with Casimir IV of Poland in 1457, the state reached its most glorious period. Stephen blocked Hungarian interventions in the Battle of Baia, invaded Wallachia in 1471, and dealt with Ottoman reprisals in a major victory (the 1475 Battle of Vaslui); after feeling threatened by Polish ambitions, he also attacked Galicia and resisted a Polish invasion in the Battle of the Cosmin Forest (1497). However, he had to surrender Chilia (now Kiliia) and Cetatea Albă (now Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi), the two main fortresses in the Budjak, to the Ottomans in 1484, and in 1498 he had to accept Ottoman suzerainty, when he was forced to agree to continue paying tribute to Sultan Bayezid II. Following the taking of Hotin (Khotyn) and Pokuttya, Stephen&#x27;s rule also brought a brief extension of Moldavian rule into Transylvania: Cetatea de Baltă and Ciceu became his fiefs in 1489.

===Early Modern Era and Renaissance===


Under Bogdan III the One-Eyed, Ottoman overlordship was confirmed in the shape that would rapidly evolve into control over Moldavia&#x27;s affairs. Peter IV Rareș, who reigned in the 1530s and 1540s, clashed with the Habsburg monarchy over his ambitions in Transylvania (losing possessions in the region to George Martinuzzi), was defeated in Pokuttya by Poland, and failed in his attempt to extricate Moldavia from Ottoman rule – the country lost Bender to the Ottomans, who included it in their Silistra Eyalet.

A period of profound crisis followed. Moldavia stopped issuing its own coinage , under Prince Ștefăniță, when it was confronted with rapid depletion of funds and rising demands from the Porte. Such problems became endemic when the country, brought into the Great Turkish War, suffered the impact of the stagnation of the Ottoman Empire; at one point, during the 1650s and 1660s, princes began relying on counterfeit coinage (usually copies of Swedish riksdalers, as was that issued by Eustratie Dabija). The economic decline was accompanied by a failure to maintain state structures: the feudal-based Moldavian military forces were no longer convoked, and the few troops maintained by the rulers remained professional mercenaries such as the &quot;seimeni&quot;.


However, Moldavia and the similarly affected Wallachia remained both important sources of income for the Ottoman Empire and relatively prosperous agricultural economies (especially as suppliers of grain and cattle – the latter was especially relevant in Moldavia, which remained an under-populated country of pastures). In time, much of the resources were tied to the Ottoman economy, either through monopolies on trade that were only lifted in 1829, after the Treaty of Adrianople (which did not affect all domains directly), or through the raise in direct taxes - the one demanded by the Ottomans from the princes, as well as the ones demanded by the princes from the country&#x27;s population. Taxes were directly proportional with Ottoman requests, but also with the growing importance of Ottoman appointment and sanctioning of princes in front of election by the boyars and the boyar Council – &quot;&quot; (drawing in a competition among pretenders, which also implied the intervention of creditors as suppliers of bribes). The fiscal system soon included taxes such as the &quot;văcărit&quot; (a tax on head of cattle), first introduced by Iancu Sasul in the 1580s.

The economic opportunities offered brought about a significant influx of Greek and Levantine financiers and officials, who entered a stiff competition with the high boyars over appointments to the Court. As the manor system suffered the blows of economic crises, and in the absence of salarisation (which implied that persons in office could decide their own income), obtaining princely appointment became the major focus of a boyar&#x27;s career. Such changes also implied the decline of free peasantry and the rise of serfdom, as well as the rapid fall in the importance of low boyars (a traditional institution, the latter soon became marginal, and, in more successful instances, added to the population of towns); however, they also implied a rapid transition towards a monetary economy, based on exchanges in foreign currency. Serfdom was doubled by the much less numerous slave population (&quot;robi&quot;), composed of migrant Roma and captured Nogais.

The conflict between princes and boyars was to become exceptionally violent – the latter group, who frequently appealed to the Ottoman court in order to have princes comply with its demands, was persecuted by rulers such as Alexandru Lăpușneanu and John III. Ioan Vodă&#x27;s revolt against the Ottomans ended in his execution (1574). The country descended into political chaos, with frequent Ottoman and Tatar incursions and pillages. The claims of Mușatins to the crown and the traditional system of succession were ended by scores of illegitimate reigns; one of the usurpers, Ioan Iacob Heraclid, was a Protestant Greek who encouraged the Renaissance and attempted to introduce Lutheranism to Moldavia.

In 1595, the rise of the Movilești boyars to the throne with Ieremia Movilă coincided with the start of frequent anti-Ottoman and anti-Habsburg military expeditions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth into Moldavian territory (see &quot;Moldavian Magnate Wars&quot;), and rivalries between pretenders to the Moldavian throne encouraged by the three competing powers.

The Wallachian prince Michael the Brave, after previously taking over Transylvania, also deposed Prince Ieremia Movilă, in 1600, and managed to become the first Prince to rule over Moldavia, Wallachia, and Transylvania; the episode ended in Polish conquests of lands down to Bucharest, soon ended by the outbreak of the Polish–Swedish War and the reestablishment of Ottoman rule. Polish incursions were dealt a blow by the Ottomans. 

== Assassination of voivode ==
During the 1620 Battle of Cecora, the voivode of the Principality of Moldavia, was assassinated by the Septilici noble family in which also saw an end to the reign of Gaspar Graziani.

A period of relative peace followed during the more prosperous and prestigious rule of Vasile Lupu. He took the throne as a boyar appointee in 1637 and began battling his rival Gheorghe Ștefan, as well as the Wallachian prince Matei Basarab. However, his invasion of Wallachia, with the backing of Cossack Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, ended in disaster at the Battle of Finta in 1653. A few years later, Moldavia was occupied for two short intervals by the anti-Ottoman Wallachian prince Constantin Șerban, who clashed with the first ruler of the Ghica family, George Ghica. In the early 1680s, Moldavian troops under George Ducas intervened in right-bank Ukraine and assisted Mehmed IV in the Battle of Vienna, only to suffer the effects of the Great Turkish War.

===Phanariots (1711–1822)===


During the late 17th century, Moldavia became the target of the Russian Empire&#x27;s southwards expansion, inaugurated by Peter the Great with the Russo-Turkish War of 1710-1711. Prince Dimitrie Cantemir sided with Peter in open rebellion against the Ottomans, but he was defeated at Stănilești. Sultan Ahmed III officially discarded recognition of local choices for princes, imposing instead a system relying solely on Ottoman approval: the Phanariote epoch, inaugurated by the reign of Nicholas Mavrocordatos.

Phanariote rule was marked by political corruption, intrigue, and high taxation, as well as by sporadic incursions of Habsburg and Russian armies deep into Moldavian territory. Nonetheless, they also attempted legislative and administrative modernization inspired by The Enlightenment (such as the decision by Constantine Mavrocordatos to salarize public offices, to the outrage of boyars, and the abolition of serfdom in 1749, as well as Scarlat Callimachi&#x27;s &quot;Code&quot;), and signified a decrease in Ottoman demands after the threat of Russian annexation became real and the prospects of a better life led to waves of peasant emigration to neighboring lands. The effects of Ottoman control were also made less notable after the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca allowed Russia to intervene in favour of Ottoman subjects of the Eastern Orthodox faith - leading to campaigns of petitioning by the Moldavian boyars against princely policies.

In 1712, Hotin was taken over by the Ottomans and became part of a defensive system that Moldavian princes were required to maintain, as well as an area for Islamic colonization (the Laz community).

===Fragmentation===

In 1775, Moldavia lost to the Habsburg Empire its northwestern part, which became known as Bukovina. For Moldavia, it meant both an important territorial loss and a major blow to the cattle trade, as the region stood on the trade route to Central Europe.

The Treaty of Jassy in 1792 forced the Ottoman Empire to cede Yedisan to the Russian Empire, which made Russian presence much more notable, given that the Empire acquired a common border with Moldavia. The first effect of this was the cession of the eastern half of Moldavia (renamed as Bessarabia) to the Russian Empire in 1812.

===Organic Statute, 1848 revolution===

Phanariote rule was officially ended after the 1821 occupation of the country by Alexander Ypsilantis&#x27;s Filiki Eteria during the Greek War of Independence; the subsequent Ottoman retaliation led to the rule of Ioan Sturdza. He was considered the first of a new system, since the Ottomans and Russia had agreed in 1826 to allow for the election by locals of rulers over the two Danubian Principalities, and convened on their mandating for seven-year terms. In practice, a new foundation to reigns in Moldavia was created by the Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829), beginning a period of Russian domination over the two countries which ended only in 1856. Begun as a military occupation under the command of Pavel Kiselyov, Russian domination gave Wallachia and Moldavia, which were not removed from nominal Ottoman control, the modernizing &quot;Organic Statute&quot; (the first document resembling a constitution, as well as the first to regard both principalities). After 1829, the country also became an important destination for immigration of Ashkenazi Jews from the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria and areas of Russia (&quot;see History of the Jews in Romania and Sudiți&quot;).

The first Moldavian rule established under the Statute, that of Mihail Sturdza, was nonetheless ambivalent: eager to reduce abuse of office, Sturdza introduced reforms (the abolition of slavery, secularization, economic rebuilding), but he was widely seen as enforcing his own power over that of the newly instituted consultative Assembly. A supporter of the union of his country with Wallachia and of Romanian Romantic nationalism, he obtained the establishment of a customs union between the two countries (1847) and showed support for radical projects favored by low boyars; nevertheless, he clamped down with noted violence the Moldavian revolutionary attempt in the last days of March 1848. Grigore Alexandru Ghica allowed the exiled revolutionaries to return to Moldavia c. 1853, which led to the creation of the National Party (), a trans-boundary group of radical union supporters which campaigned for a single state under a foreign dynasty.

===Southern Bessarabia===
In 1856, under the terms of the Treaty of Paris, the Russian Empire returned to Moldavia a significant territory in southern Bessarabia (including a part of Budjak), organised later as the Bolgrad, Cahul, and Ismail counties.

===Union with Wallachia===

Russian domination ended abruptly after the Crimean War, when the Treaty of Paris also passed the two Romanian principalities under the tutelage of Great European Powers (together with Russia and the Ottoman overlord, power-sharing included the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Austrian Empire, the French Empire, the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, and Prussia). Due to Austrian and Ottoman opposition and British reserves, the union program as demanded by radical campaigners was debated intensely.

In September 1857, given that &quot;Caimacam&quot; Nicolae Vogoride had perpetrated fraud in elections in Moldavia, the Powers allowed the two states to convene ad hoc divans, which were to decide a new constitutional framework; the result showed overwhelming support for the union, as the creation of a liberal and neutral state. After further meetings among leaders of tutor states, an agreement was reached (the &quot;Paris Convention&quot;), whereby a limited union was to be enforced – separate governments and thrones, with only two bodies in common (a Court of Cassation and a Central Commission residing in Focșani); it also stipulated that an end to all privilege was to be passed into law, and awarded back to Moldavia the areas around Bolhrad, Cahul, and Izmail.

However, the Convention failed to note whether the two thrones could not be occupied by the same person, allowing &quot;Partida Națională&quot; to introduce the candidacy of Alexandru Ioan Cuza in both countries. On January 17 (January 5, 1859, Old Style), in Iași, he was elected prince of Moldavia by the respective electoral body. After street pressure over the much more conservative body in Bucharest, Cuza was elected in Wallachia as well (February 5/January 24), this being considered as the day of the unification of Moldavia and Wallachia by means of a personal union.

In 1862, after diplomatic missions that helped remove opposition to the action, the United Principalities (the basis of modern Romania) was formally created, and instituted Cuza as &quot;Domnitor&quot; – thus officially ending the existence of the Principality of Moldavia. All other pending legal matters were clarified after the replacement of Cuza with Carol of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen in April 1866, and the creation of an independent Kingdom of Romania in 1881.

===Slavery===
Slavery () was part of the social order from before the founding of the Principality of Moldavia, until it was abolished in stages during the 1840s and 1850s. Most of the slaves were of Roma (Gypsy) ethnicity. There were also slaves of Tatar ethnicity, probably prisoners captured from the wars with the Nogai and Crimean Tatars. The institution of slavery was first attested in a 1470 Moldavian document, through which Prince Stephen the Great frees Oană, a Tatar slave who had fled to Jagiellon Poland.

The exact origins of slavery are not known, as it was a common practice in medieval Europe. As in the Byzantine Empire, the Roma were held as slaves of the state, of the boyars or of the monasteries. Historian Nicolae Iorga associated the Roma people&#x27;s arrival with the 1241 Mongol invasion of Europe and considered their slavery as a vestige of that era; he believed that the Romanians took the Roma as slaves from the Mongols and preserved their status to control their labor. Other historians consider that the Roma were enslaved while captured during the battles with the Tatars. The practice of enslaving prisoners may also have been taken from the Mongols. The ethnic identity of the &quot;Tatar slaves&quot; is unknown, they could have been captured Tatars of the Golden Horde, Cumans, or the slaves of Tatars and Cumans. While it is possible that some Romani people were slaves or auxiliary troops of the Mongols or Tatars, most of them came from south of the Danube, demonstrating that slavery was a widespread practice. The Tatar slaves, smaller in numbers, were eventually merged into the Roma population.

Traditionally, Roma slaves were divided into three categories. The smallest was owned by the &quot;hospodars&quot;, and went by the Romanian-language name of &quot;țigani domnești&quot; (&quot;Gypsies belonging to the lord&quot;). The two other categories comprised &quot;țigani mănăstirești&quot; (&quot;Gypsies belonging to the monasteries&quot;), who were the property of Romanian Orthodox and Greek Orthodox monasteries, and &quot;țigani boierești&quot; (&quot;Gypsies belonging to the boyars&quot;), who were enslaved by the category of landowners.

The abolition of slavery was carried out following a campaign by young revolutionaries who embraced the liberal ideas of the Enlightenment. In 1844, Moldavian Prince Mihail Sturdza proposed a law on the freeing of slaves owned by the church and state. By the 1850s, the movement gained support from almost the whole of Romanian society. In December 1855, following a proposal by Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica, a bill drafted by Mihail Kogălniceanu and Petre Mavrogheni was adopted by the Divan; the law emancipated all slaves to the status of taxpayers (citizens).

Support for the abolitionists was reflected in Romanian literature of the mid-19th century. The issue of the Roma slavery became a theme in the literary works of various liberal and Romantic intellectuals, many of whom were active in the abolitionist camp. The Romanian abolitionist movement was also influenced by the much larger movement against Black slavery in the United States through press reports and through a translation of Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. Translated by Theodor Codrescu and first published in Iași in 1853, under the name &quot;Coliba lui Moșu Toma sau Viața negrilor în sudul Statelor Unite din America&quot; (which translates back as &quot;Uncle Toma&#x27;s Cabin or the Life of Blacks in the Southern United States of America&quot;), it was the first American novel to be published in Romanian. The foreword included a study on slavery by Mihail Kogălniceanu.

==Military forces==

Under the reign of Stephen the Great, all farmers and villagers had to bear arms. Stephen justified this by saying that &quot;every man has a duty to defend his fatherland&quot;; according to Polish chronicler Jan Długosz, if someone was found without carrying a weapon, he was sentenced to death. Stephen reformed the army by promoting men from the landed free peasantry &quot;răzeși&quot; (i.e. something akin to freeholding yeomen) to infantry (&quot;voinici&quot;) and light cavalry (&quot;hânsari&quot;), reducing his dependence on the boyars, and introduced guns. The Small Host (&quot;Oastea Mică&quot;) consisted of around 10,000 to 12,000 men. The Large Host (&quot;Oastea Mare&quot;), which could reach up to 40,000, was recruited from all the free peasantry older than 14 and strong enough to carry a sword or use a bow. This seldom happened, for such a levée en masse was devastating for both economy and population growth. In the Battle of Vaslui, Stephen had to summon the Large Host and also recruited mercenary troops.

In the Middle Ages and early Renaissance, the Moldavians relied on light cavalry (&quot;călărași&quot;) which used hit-and-run tactics similar to those of the Tatars; this gave them great mobility and also flexibility, in case they found it more suitable to dismount their horses and fight in hand-to-hand combat, as it happened in 1422, when 400 horse archers were sent to aid Jagiellon Poland, Moldavia&#x27;s overlord against the Teutonic Knights. When making eye-contact with the enemy, the horse archers would withdraw to a nearby forest and camouflage themselves with leaves and branches; according to Jan Długosz, when the enemy entered the wood, they were &quot;showered with arrows&quot; and defeated. The heavy cavalry consisted of the nobility, namely, the boyars, and their guards, the &quot;viteji&quot; (lit. &quot;brave ones&quot;, small nobility) and the &quot;curteni&quot; (court cavalry). These were all nominally part of the Small Host. In times of war, boyars were compelled by the feudal system of allegiance to supply the prince with troops in accordance with the extent of their manorial domain.

Other troops consisted of professional foot soldiers (&quot;lefegii&quot;) which fulfilled the heavy infantry role, and the &quot;plăieși&quot;, free peasants whose role was that of border guards: they guarded the mountain passes and were prepared to ambush the enemy and to fight delaying actions.

In the absence of the prince, command was assigned to the &quot;Mare Spătar&quot; (Grand Sword-Bearer, a military office) or to the &quot;Mare Vornic&quot; (approx. Governor of the Country; a civilian office second only to the &quot;Voievod&quot;, which was filled by the prince himself). Supplying the troops was by tradition-later-made-into-law the duty of the inhabitants of those lands on which the soldiers were present at a given time.

The Moldavians&#x27; (as well as Wallachians&#x27;) favourite military doctrine in (defensive) wars was a scorched earth policy combined with harassment of the advancing enemy using hit-and-run tactics and disruption of communication and supply lines, followed by a large scale ambush: a weakened enemy would be lured in a place where it would find itself in a position hard or impossible to defend. A general attack would follow, often with devastating results. The shattered remains of what was once the enemy army would be pursued closely and harassed all the way to the border and sometimes beyond. A typical example of successful employments of this scenario is the Battle of Vaslui.

Towards the end of the 15th century, especially after the success of guns and cannons, mercenaries became a dominant force in the country&#x27;s military. With the economic demands created by the stagnation of the Ottoman Empire, the force diminished and included only mercenaries such as the &quot;seimeni&quot;.

The 1829 Treaty of Adrianople allowed Moldavia to again maintain its own troops, no longer acting as an auxiliary under strict Ottoman supervision, and assigned red over blue pennants (&quot;see Flag and coat of arms of Moldavia&quot;). Their renewed existence under Mihail Sturdza was a major symbol and rally point for the nationalist cause, aiding in bringing about the 1848 Moldavian revolution.

===Fleet===
An early mention of a Moldavian naval fleet is found in connection with the rule of Aron Tiranul, who used it to help Wallachian ruler Michael the Brave establish his control over the Chilia branch of the Danube and Dobruja.

The Treaty of Adrianople provided for a Moldavian self-defense naval force, to be composed of caicque vessels. Schooners armed with cannons were first built in the 1840s. Along with patrolling the Danube, these made their way on its tributaries, the Siret and the Prut River.

==Geography==
Geographically, Moldavia is limited by the Carpathian Mountains to the West, the Cheremosh River to the North, the Dniester River to the East and the Danube and Black Sea to the South. The Prut River flows approximately through its middle from north to south.

Of late 15th century Moldavia, with an area of , the biggest part and the core of the former principality is located in Romania (45.6%), followed by the Republic of Moldova (31.7%), and Ukraine (22.7%). This represents 88.2% of the Republic of Moldova&#x27;s surface, 18% of Romania&#x27;s surface, and 3.5% of Ukraine&#x27;s surface.
The region is mostly hilly, with a range of mountains in the west, and plain areas in the southeast. Moldavia&#x27;s highest altitude is Ineu peak (2,279 m), which is also the westernmost point of the region.

The parts of Moldavia populated by Csángó Hungarians are sometimes referred to as Csángó Land.

===Administrative divisions===

==Population==

===Historical population===
Contemporary historians estimate the population (historically referred to as Moldavians) of the Moldavian Principality in the 15th century, at between 250,000 and 600,000 people, but an extensive census was first conducted in 1769–1774.

In 1848, the northwestern part, annexed in 1775 by the Habsburg Empire, Bukovina, had a population of 377,571; in 1856, the eastern half of Moldavia, Bessarabia, annexed in 1812 by the Russian Empire, had a population of 990,274, while the population of Moldavia proper (the western half), in 1859, was 1,463,927.

The contemporary population peaked in 1992, at 10.07 million inhabitants in all three historical divisions (Western Moldavia, Bessarabia and Bukovina). As of 2011, the population was 8.63 million people, of which 3.67 million were in Western Moldavia, 3.86 million in Bessarabia and 1.08 million in Bukovina.

===Cities===

The largest cities (as per last censuses) and metropolitan areas in the Moldavia region are:
* Romania:
** Iași – 290,422 (465,477 in metropolitan area) - capital of Moldavia between 1564 and 1859
** Galați – 249,432 (323,563)
** Bacău – 144,307 (223,239)
** Botoșani – 106,847 (144,617)
** Suceava – 92,121 (144,100) – capital of Moldavia between 1388 and 1564
** Piatra Neamț – 85,055 (131,334)
** Focșani – 79,315 (125,699)
* Ukraine:
** Chernivtsi (Cernăuți) – 240,600
** Izmail (Ismail) – 84,815
* Moldova:
** Chișinău – 532,513 (662,836 in metropolitan area)
** Bălți – 97,930 (102,457)
** Tighina (Bender) – 91,882

==Education==

In 1562, the so-called Schola Latina (a Latin Academic College) was founded in Cotnari, near Iași, a school which marked the beginnings of the organized humanistic education institutions in Moldavia.

The first institute of higher learning that functioned on the territory of Romania was Academia Vasiliană (1640), founded by Prince Vasile Lupu as a &quot;Higher School for Latin and Slavonic Languages&quot;, followed by the Princely Academy, in 1707. The first high education structure in Romanian was established in the autumn of 1813, when Gheorghe Asachi laid the foundations of a class of engineers, its activities taking place within the Greek Princely Academy.

After 1813, other moments marked the development of higher education in Romanian, regarding both humanities and the technical science. Academia Mihăileană, founded in 1835 by Prince Mihail Sturdza, is considered the first Romanian superior institute. In 1860, three faculties part of the Academia Mihăileană formed the nucleus for the newly established University of Iași, the first Romanian modern university.

<text>Gary Anthony James Webb (born 8 March 1958), known professionally as Gary Numan, is an English musician. He entered the music industry as frontman of the new wave band Tubeway Army. After releasing two studio albums with the band, he released his debut solo studio album &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot; in 1979, topping the UK Albums Chart. His commercial popularity peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s with hits including &quot;Are &#x27;Friends&#x27; Electric?&quot; and &quot;Cars&quot; (both of which reached number one on the UK singles chart). Numan maintains a cult following. He has sold over 10 million records.

Numan is regarded as a pioneer of electronic music. He developed a signature sound consisting of heavy synthesizer hooks fed through guitar effects pedals, and is also known for his distinctive voice and androgynous &quot;android&quot; persona. He received an Ivor Novello Award, the Inspiration Award, from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors in 2017.

== Early life ==
Gary Anthony James Webb was born on 8 March 1958 in Hammersmith, London. His father was a British Airways bus driver based at Heathrow Airport. He was seven when his family adopted his cousin (father&#x27;s nephew) John, who would become a musician and play in Numan&#x27;s backing band. He was educated at Town Farm Junior School in Stanwell; Ashford County Grammar School; and Slough Grammar School, followed by Brooklands Technical College in Weybridge, Surrey. He joined the Air Training Corps as a teenager and briefly held various jobs including London Heathrow Airport bus driver, forklift truck driver, air conditioning ventilator fitter, and accounts clerk.

When Numan was 15, his father bought him a Gibson Les Paul guitar, which became his most treasured possession. He briefly played in various bands and looked through advertisements in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; for bands to join. He claims to have unsuccessfully auditioned as guitarist for the then-unknown band the Jam before joining Mean Street and the Lasers, where he met Paul Gardiner. The latter band would soon become Tubeway Army, with his uncle Jess Lidyard on drums and Gardiner on bass. The band signed a recording contract with Beggars Banquet Records. His initial pseudonym was Valerian, probably in reference to the hero in French science fiction comic series &quot;Valérian and Laureline&quot;. He later picked the surname Numan from an advertisement in the yellow pages for a plumber whose surname was Neumann.

== Music career ==
=== 1977–1981: Tubeway Army and the &quot;Machine Trilogy&quot; ===
Numan came to prominence in the 1970s as lead vocalist, songwriter, and record producer for Tubeway Army. After adopting a punk rock-style they signed a recording contract with Beggars Banquet Records and released their debut single &quot;That&#x27;s Too Bad&quot; in February 1978. It was followed by the recording of an album&#x27;s worth of demo tapes in March 1978 (released in 1984 as &quot;The Plan&quot;), and a second single, &quot;Bombers&quot;, which like the first single did not chart. The two singles were released again as a gatefold doublepack in 1979, and in 1983 a re-release of &quot;That&#x27;s Too Bad&quot; reached No. 97 on the UK singles chart.

Tubeway Army&#x27;s self-titled, new wave-oriented debut studio album, released in November 1978, sold out its limited run and introduced Numan&#x27;s fascination with dystopian science fiction and synthesizers. During the recording of the album Numan found a Moog synthesizer left behind in the studio and the transition towards an electronic sound began. Though the band&#x27;s third single, the dark-themed and slow-paced &quot;Down in the Park&quot; (1979), did not appear on the charts, it became one of Numan&#x27;s most enduring and oft-covered songs. It was featured with other contemporary hits on the soundtrack for the American drama film &quot;Times Square&quot; (1980), and a live version of the song appeared in the British concert film &quot;Urgh! A Music War&quot; (1982). Following exposure in a television advertisement for Lee Cooper jeans with the jingle &quot;Don&#x27;t Be a Dummy&quot;, Tubeway Army released the single &quot;Are &#x27;Friends&#x27; Electric?&quot; in May 1979. After a modest start at the lower reaches of the UK singles chart at No. 71, it steadily climbed to No. 1 at the end of June and remained on that position for four consecutive weeks. In July its parent studio album &quot;Replicas&quot; also reached No. 1 on the albums chart.

At this point Numan was recording his next studio album with a new backing band, having recruited keyboardist Chris Payne and drummer Cedric Sharpley. At the peak of success, Numan opted to premiere four songs in a John Peel session in June 1979 rather than promoting the current album and the Tubeway Army group name was dropped.

In September &quot;Cars&quot; reached No. 1 in the UK. The single found success in North American charts where &quot;Cars&quot; spent 2 weeks at No. 1 on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; charts, and reached No. 9 in the US in 1980. &quot;Cars&quot; and the 1979 studio album &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot; were both released under Numan&#x27;s own stage name. The album reached No. 1 in the UK, and a sell-out tour (&quot;The Touring Principle&quot;) followed; the concert video it spawned is often cited as the first full-length commercial music video release. &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot; was a rock album with no guitars; instead, Numan used synthesizers connected to effects units to achieve a distorted, phased, metallic tone. A second single from the album, &quot;Complex&quot;, made it to No. 6 on the UK singles chart.
In 1980, Numan topped the UK album charts for a third time with &quot;Telekon&quot;, and the singles &quot;We Are Glass&quot; and &quot;I Die: You Die&quot;, released prior to the album, reaching No. 5 and No. 6 on the UK charts. &quot;This Wreckage&quot;, the only single taken from the original album release, entered the UK top 20 in December that year. &quot;Telekon&quot;, the final studio album that Numan retrospectively termed the &quot;Machine&quot; section of his career, reintroduced guitars to Numan&#x27;s music and featured a wider range of synthesizers. The same year he embarked on his second major tour (&quot;The Teletour&quot;) with a more elaborate stage show than &quot;The Touring Principle&quot; the previous year. In April 1981, Numan decided to retire from touring following his upcoming series of concerts at Wembley Arena, where he was supported by experimental musician Nash the Slash and Shock, a rock/mime/burlesque troupe whose members included Barbie Wilde, Tik and Tok, and Carole Caplin. &quot;Living Ornaments &#x27;79 and &#x27;80&quot;, a live two album box-set from the 1979 and 1980 tours, was released at this time, reaching No. 2 in the UK charts. Both albums, also individually released as &quot;Living Ornaments &#x27;79&quot; and &quot;Living Ornaments &#x27;80&quot; also charted. The decision to retire would be short-lived.

=== 1981–1983: New musical directions ===

Departing from the pure electropop that he had been associated with, Numan began experimenting with jazz, funk, and ethereal, rhythmic pop. His first studio album after his farewell concerts was &quot;Dance&quot; (1981). The album charted at No. 3 on the UK charts, with an eight-week chart run and produced one hit single (&quot;She&#x27;s Got Claws&quot;), which reached No. 6. The album featured several distinguished guest players; Mick Karn (bass guitar; saxophone) and Rob Dean (guitar) of Japan, Roger Mason (keyboards) of Models, and Roger Taylor (drums) of Queen.

With his former backing band, Chris Payne (keyboards; viola), Russell Bell (guitar), and Ced Sharpley (drums) now reformed as Dramatis, Numan contributed lead vocals to the minor hit &quot;Love Needs No Disguise&quot; from the studio album &quot;For Future Reference&quot; (1981) and lent lead vocals to the first single released by his long-term bassist Paul Gardiner, &quot;Stormtrooper in Drag&quot;, which also made the charts. However, Numan&#x27;s success began to wane as he was outsold by the Human League, Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, and his prior support act, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD). With each new studio album, Numan would take on a particular persona, but none seemed to catch audiences&#x27; attention like he had been able to in 1979.

Numan&#x27;s fourth solo studio album &quot;I, Assassin&quot; (1982) produced the top 10 hit &quot;We Take Mystery (To Bed)&quot;, as well as the top 20 singles &quot;Music for Chameleons&quot; and &quot;White Boys and Heroes&quot;, the album peaking at No. 8 with a six-week chart run. The heavily percussive funk style made several tracks from the album, such as the 12&quot; version of &quot;Music for Chameleons&quot; and a special remix of &quot;White Boys and Heroes&quot;, unexpected successes in the American club scene and in October 1982 he embarked on a US tour.

&quot;Warriors&quot; (1983) further developed Numan&#x27;s jazz-influenced style and featured contributions from avant-garde musician Bill Nelson of Be-Bop Deluxe (who fell out with Numan during recording and chose to be uncredited as the album&#x27;s co-producer), and saxophonist Dick Morrissey (who also performed on &quot;The Fury&quot;, &quot;Strange Charm&quot; and &quot;Outland&quot;). The album peaked at No. 12, produced two hit singles including the top 20 title-track and, like &quot;I, Assassin&quot;, spent six weeks in the charts. &quot;Warriors&quot; was the last album Numan recorded for Beggars Banquet Records, and was supported by a 40-date UK tour (again with support from robotic mime and music duo Tik and Tok).

=== 1984–1993: Record label foundation, collaborations, and career downturn ===
Numan subsequently issued a series of albums and singles on his own record label, Numa. The first studio album released, 1984&#x27;s &quot;Berserker&quot;, was Numan&#x27;s first foray into music computers and samplers (in this case, the PPG Wave). The album was accompanied by a new, blue-and-white colour scheme and visual (including Numan himself, with blue hair), as well as a tour, a live album, video, EP, and the title track as a single. The track charted within the UK top 40. Despite this, the album divided critics and fans, and ultimately performed poorly, stalling at No. 32 on the UK chart. Numan cites many reasons for this, including distribution issues.

A collaboration with Bill Sharpe (of Shakatak) as Sharpe &amp; Numan, in 1985, was more successful; in March of that year, the single &quot;Change Your Mind&quot; reached No. 17 on the UK singles chart. A few months later, the live album &quot;White Noise&quot; (recorded during the &quot;Berserker Tour&quot;) and a live EP with tracks taken from it (titled &quot;The Live EP&quot;) reached No. 29 and 27 on the charts, respectively.
Numan&#x27;s next studio album, &quot;The Fury&quot; (1985), charted slightly higher than &quot;Berserker&quot;, breaking the top 30. Again, the album heralded a change of image, this time featuring Numan in a white suit and red bow tie. However, for the first time in his career, neither of the three singles released from the album (&quot;Your Fascination&quot;, &quot;Call Out the Dogs&quot; and &quot;Miracles&quot;) managed to reach the top 40, barely entering the top 50 on the UK charts.

The following year, Numan scored two top-30 UK singles, with &quot;This Is Love&quot; in April 1986, and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stop&quot; in June that year; the subsequent album, &quot;Strange Charm&quot;, was released later that year, but only spent two weeks on the albums chart, where it peaked at No. 59. In November of that year, a version of the song &quot;I Still Remember&quot;, from the previous album, was released as a charity single, but stalled at No. 74 on the singles chart.

Further collaborations with Bill Sharpe spawned two more Sharpe &amp; Numan hits with &quot;New Thing from London Town&quot;, peaking at No. 52 in 1986, and &quot;No More Lies&quot; at No. 35 in 1988. In 1987, Numan performed vocals for three singles by Radio Heart, a project of brothers Hugh and David Nicholson (formerly of Marmalade and Blue), which charted with varying success (&quot;Radio Heart&quot;, No. 35 in the UK, &quot;London Times&quot;, No. 48, &quot;All Across the Nation&quot;, No. 81). An album was also released, credited to &quot;Radio Heart featuring Gary Numan&quot;, with Numan only appearing on three tracks; the record failed to chart. Also in 1987, Numan&#x27;s old label, Beggars Banquet, released the best-of compilation &quot;Exhibition&quot;, which reached No. 43 on the UK Albums Chart, and a remix of &quot;Cars&quot;. The remix, titled &quot;Cars (E Reg Model)&quot;, charted at No. 16, marking Numan&#x27;s final Top 20 hit (until the same song was re-released in 1996).

Numa Records, which had been launched during a flurry of idealistic excitement, folded after the release of Numan&#x27;s 1986 studio album &quot;Strange Charm&quot;. Numan would reopen the record label in 1992, yet it was again shuttered in 1996. In addition to Numa Records&#x27; commercial failure, Numan&#x27;s own amassed fortune (since the late 1970s), which he estimated to be around £4.5 million, was drained. He then signed a recording contract with I.R.S. Records for the release of his final studio album of the 1980s, &quot;Metal Rhythm&quot; (1988), which also sold relatively poorly. For its American release, the record label edited the album&#x27;s title to &quot;New Anger&quot; after the lead single&#x27;s title, and also changed the album colour from black to blue and remixed several of its tracks, against Numan&#x27;s wishes. In 1989, the Sharpe &amp; Numan album &quot;Automatic&quot; was released through Polydor Records, though this too failed to garner much commercial success, briefly entering the charts for just one week at No. 59.

In 1991, Numan ventured into film-scoring by co-composing the music for &quot;The Unborn&quot; with Michael R. Smith (the score was later released as the 1995 album &quot;Human&quot;). After &quot;Outland&quot; (1991), another critical and commercial disappointment and his second and last studio album with I.R.S., Numan reactivated Numa Records, under which he would release his next two studio albums. His first Numa Records release, &quot;Machine + Soul&quot;, is considered by many, including Numan himself, to be a career low point, released primarily to pay off debt. After the poor reception of the album, Numan considered leaving the music industry entirely. In 1993, he released a single &quot;Cars (&#x27;93 Sprint)&quot;, a techno remix of &quot;Cars&quot;. That same year, he supported Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (who had opened for him in 1979) on their concert tour.

=== 1994–2001: New musical direction and critical acclaim ===
By 1994, Numan decided to stop attempting to crack the pop market and concentrate instead on exploring more personal themes, including his vocal atheism. His future wife Gemma encouraged him to strip away the influences of the more recent years. Numan thus sought a grittier, more industrial tone for his songwriting on the album &quot;Sacrifice,&quot; on which, for the first time, he played almost all the instruments himself. Nine Inch Nails (NIN), who were influenced by Numan&#x27;s music, and other bands with industrial tendencies were contemporaneously becoming famous, and &quot;Sacrifice&quot; received critical acclaim. According to Numan, the influence was mutual. He cites &quot;Closer&quot; as his favourite Nine Inch Nails song, and has said &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; has &quot;the best chorus ever&quot;. Depeche Mode&#x27;s album &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; that came out during the recording of &quot;Sacrifice&quot; became a massive influence on Numan that both musically and lyrically inspired his new, darker direction.

&quot;Sacrifice&quot; was the final studio album that Numan made before shutting down Numa Records permanently. His next two studio albums, &quot;Exile&quot; (1997) and &quot;Pure&quot; (2000), were well received and significantly helped to restore his critical reputation, as did a tribute album dedicated to Numan, &quot;Random&quot;. &quot;Random&quot; was released shortly before &quot;Exile&quot; and featured artists, such as Damon Albarn and Jesus Jones, who had been influenced by Numan. Numan toured the US in support of &quot;Exile&quot;, his first stateside concerts since the early 1980s.

=== 2002–2008: Further works and return to chart success ===
In 2002, Numan enjoyed chart success once again with the single &quot;Rip&quot;, reaching No. 29 on the UK singles chart, and again in 2003 with the Gary Numan vs Rico single &quot;Crazier&quot;, which reached No. 13 in the UK charts. Rico also worked on the 2003 remix album &quot;Hybrid&quot; which featured reworkings of older songs in a more contemporary industrial style as well as new material. Other artists and producers who contributed on these remixes included Curve, Flood, Andy Gray, Alan Moulder, New Disease, and Sulpher. 2003 saw Numan performing the vocals on &quot;Pray for You&quot;, the single from the Plump DJs studio album &quot;Eargasm&quot;, which reached No. 89 on the UK Top 100 Chart. In 2005, Numan took control of his own business affairs again with the launch of his recording label, Mortal Records.

On 13 March 2006, Numan&#x27;s studio album, &quot;Jagged&quot;, was released. An album launch gig took place at The Forum, London on 18 March followed by UK, European and US tours in support of the release. Numan also launched a &quot;Jagged&quot; website to showcase the album, and made plans to have his 1981 farewell concert (previously released as &quot;Micromusic&quot; on VHS) issued on DVD by November 2006 as well as releasing the DVD version of the &quot;Jagged&quot; album launch gig. Numan undertook a brief &quot;Telekon&quot; &#x27;Classic Album&#x27; tour in the UK in December 2006, performing at Rock City, the Kentish Town Forum and Club Academy.

Numan contributed vocals to four tracks on the April 2007 release of the debut solo studio album by Ade Fenton, &quot;Artificial Perfect&quot;, on his new industrial/electronic label, Submission, including &quot;The Leather Sea&quot;, &quot;Slide Away&quot;, &quot;Recall&quot;, and the first single to be taken from the album, &quot;Healing&quot;. The second single to be released in the UK was &quot;The Leather Sea&quot; on 30 July 2007, which charted.

He sold out a 15-date UK and Ireland tour in spring 2008, during which he performed his 1979 number-one studio album &quot;Replicas&quot; in its entirety, and all the Replicas-era music including B-sides. The successful tour reflected the resurging popularity of electropop in the UK and coincided with his 50th birthday and 30th anniversary of the original release of &quot;Replicas&quot;.

In November 2007, Numan confirmed via his website that work on a new studio album, with the working title of &quot;Splinter&quot;, would be under way throughout 2008, after finishing an alternate version of &quot;Jagged&quot; (called &quot;Jagged Edge&quot;) and the CD of unreleased songs from his previous three studio albums (released in 2011 as &quot;Dead Son Rising&quot;). Numan released his subsequent album, &quot;Splinter (Songs from a Broken Mind)&quot;, in 2013.

=== 2009–present ===
Numan was set to perform a small number of American live dates in April 2010, including a Coachella Festival appearance in California, but had to cancel because air travel in Europe was halted by the Icelandic volcanic ash cloud. As a result, the tour was not only postponed but expanded, and his Pleasure Principle 30th Anniversary Tour&#x27;s American and Mexican dates began on 17 October 2010, at Firestone Live in Orlando, Florida.

Numan toured Australia in May 2011 performing his album &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot; in its entirety to celebrate its thirtieth anniversary. Joining him on tour was Australian electronic band Severed Heads, coming out of retirement especially for the shows.

Numan lent his vocals to the track &quot;My Machines&quot; on Battles&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Gloss Drop&quot; (2011). He was chosen by Battles to perform at the ATP Nightmare Before Christmas festival that they co-curated in December 2011 in Minehead, England. Numan&#x27;s studio album &quot;Dead Son Rising&quot; was released on 16 September 2011, which had a full UK tour split in two-halves, 15–21 September and 7–11 December. Both parts were supported by Welsh soloist Jayce Lewis; in an interview during the tour Numan said Lewis was &quot;one of the most popular&quot; support acts he had toured with. Numan later published some of his tour diary online.

Numan provided narration for Aurelio Voltaire&#x27;s 5th short film in his &quot;ChimeraScope&quot; series, &quot;Odokuro&quot; in 2011, which won 12 awards and was shown as a selection at numerous film festivals between 2011 and 2013.

The studio album &quot;Splinter (Songs from a Broken Mind)&quot;, was released on 14 October 2013. It reached the UK Top 20, his first album to do so for 30 years. It was promoted by an extensive US, Canada, UK and Ireland tour which continued in 2014 to include Israel, New Zealand, Australia and Europe. A further US leg took place in late 2014.

In June 2014, Numan collaborated with Jayce Lewis on the track &quot;Redesign&quot; which originally featured on the Welshman&#x27;s Protafield album &quot;Nemesis&quot; The same album was re-released as a &quot;Special Edition&quot; under Lewis&#x27;s solo name in 2018. Numan provided vocals for the song &quot;Long Way Down&quot;, composed by Masafumi Takada with lyrics written by Rich Dickerson, for the survival horror video game &quot;The Evil Within&quot;, which was released on 14 October 2014. Numan performed a sold-out, one-off live show in London in November 2014 at the Hammersmith Apollo supported by Gang of Four.

Numan collaborated with the industrial pop group VOWWS for &quot;Losing Myself in You&quot; on their debut studio album &quot;The Great Sun&quot;.

On 6 May 2016, Numan was one of several collaborators on Jean-Michel Jarre&#x27;s eighteenth studio album &quot;Electronica 2: The Heart of Noise&quot;, with the track &quot;Here for You&quot;, cowritten by Jarre and Numan.

On 10 May 2016, Numan was named the recipient of the 2016 Moog Innovation Award by Moog Music. On 18 May 2017, Numan received an Ivor Novello Inspiration Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.

In 2017, Numan released the single &quot;My Name Is Ruin&quot; and went on a European tour September. Numan&#x27;s studio album &quot;Savage (Songs from a Broken World)&quot; was released on 15 September and charted at number two in the UK. He was the winner of the 2017 T3 tech legends award.

On 24 September 2018, Numan&#x27;s tour bus hit and killed an elderly man in Cleveland, Ohio, US. The driver was not immediately charged. Numan was scheduled to appear at the Cleveland House of Blues that evening but cancelled the show for being &quot;inappropriate&quot; in light of the day&#x27;s tragedy.

His next studio album &quot;Intruder&quot; was released on 21 May 2021. The title track was released earlier, on 11 January 2021. Numan discussed its genesis with writer Guy Mankowski, who has a chapter on Numan&#x27;s legacy in his book &quot;Albion&#x27;s Secret History: Snapshots of England&#x27;s Pop Rebels and Outsiders&quot;, as part of an interview series on influential English artists for Zer0 Books.

Following his US Intruder tour in late 2021 and early 2022, Numan began a 17-venue UK tour between late April and late May 2022.

Numan performed at the Cruel World Festival in Pasadena, California on 20 May 2023. After a nearby lightning storm led to an early evacuation, truncating Iggy Pop&#x27;s set and cancelling Siouxsie Sioux&#x27;s headlining set entirely, a second show was quickly announced for the following day, with Siouxsie, Pop and Numan returning.

In October 2023, Numan performed a series of eight acoustic gigs, playing songs from his repertoire in a new way in smaller, intimate settings. Locations included Wylam Brewery, Newcastle, Manchester Cathedral, and Hackney Church in London.

In February 2024, Numan announced a UK tour to celebrate the 45th anniversary of his 1979 albums &quot;Replicas&quot; and &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot;. Including shows in Norwich, Sheffield, Glasgow, Newcastle, Manchester, London, Bristol, Cardiff, Bournemouth, Birmingham and Nottingham between 19 May and 1 June.

== Artistry and image ==
In the late 1970s, Numan began developing his style. According to Numan, this was an unintentional result of acne; before an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, &quot;I had spots everywhere, so they slapped about half an inch of white make-up on me before I&#x27;d even walked in the door. And my eyes were like pissholes in the snow, so they put black on there. My so-called image fell into place an hour before going on the show.&quot; His previously &quot;wooden&quot; stage presence was, in his words, a result of &quot;incredible self-consciousness&quot; and &quot;incompetence – I didn&#x27;t know to move on stage&quot;. He became enamoured by the idea of &quot;being cold about everything, not letting emotions get to you, or presenting a front of not feeling&quot;, though his stage presence later became more intense and extroverted.

Initially, Numan used his invention of the mysterious fantasy character &quot;Mach-man&quot;, a machine in human skin dressed all in black, which developed from short stories he wrote at school, as his stage persona. But this image was replaced in 1981 by a totally different &quot;gangster&quot;-look inspired by a television programme on 1930s eccentric millionaire Howard Hughes.

Later in the 1980s, Numan adopted a new visual image for each new album, such as the &quot;Mad Max&quot;-influenced image for &quot;Warriors&quot;, the white-skinned, white-clad &quot;Iceman&quot; with blue hair and make-up for the 1984 &quot;Berserker&quot; album and tour, the white suit and red bow-tie image for &quot;The Fury&quot;, and a &quot;Blade Runner&quot;-influenced image for &quot;Strange Charm&quot;. 

A prolific songwriter, Numan has as of 2021 written about 400 songs. His starting point is usually a piano to work out melodies and chord structures. Most of the songs on his early albums were written on a piano his parents had bought him: later in his career he has used a piano preset on the computer as a starting point. However, his biggest hit &quot;Cars&quot; was unconventionally written on a bass guitar.

Numan&#x27;s recognisable vocals have become one of his trademarks, along with his androgynous &quot;android&quot; stage persona.

==Musical influences==
In a 2012 interview, Numan spoke about the music that has had an influence on him over the years. As a teenager he was fan of T. Rex, David Bowie and Queen. His band Tubeway Army started in the punk rock-vein in 1977, but Numan later said that the punk rock style was adopted with the sole intention to obtain a recording contract. Ultravox&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;Systems of Romance&quot; was the main influence behind Tubeway Army&#x27;s transition into an electronic sound. Numan cited the album, and particularly the song &quot;Slow Motion&quot;, as the blueprint for what he wanted to achieve. Moving away from the commercially successful synth-pop on the 1979 albums &quot;Replicas&quot; and &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot; to a more introspective and partly ambient sound, David Bowie&#x27;s collaborations with Brian Eno, the band Japan and Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Berlin&quot; album has been cited as some of the influences that informed Numan&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;Dance&quot;. At this point, jazz and funk influences became prominent in Numan&#x27;s music, as on the single &quot;She&#x27;s Got Claws&quot; and his 1982 album &quot;I, Assassin&quot;. His 1983 album &quot;Warriors&quot; started as a collaboration with Bill Nelson, guitarist in Bebop Deluxe, which was another of Numan&#x27;s favourite bands in the 1970s. Adopting a heavier, more aggressive sound, the production of his 1984 album &quot;Berserker&quot; took influence from Trevor Horn&#x27;s production of Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Wanting to broaden his musical output, Numan&#x27;s mid- to late 1980&#x27;s releases featured a jazz-funk style, blending an industrial edge with funk and synth-pop sensibilities. Following the release of two commercially and critically unsuccessful pop and funk influenced albums in the early 1990s, Numan found new pivotal influences in Nine Inch Nails and Depeche Mode&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; that inspired him to move into a darker sound that became the trademark of his later career.

== Legacy ==

Within the UK&#x27;s burgeoning synth-pop scene, Numan was the first artist to achieve mainstream notoriety. His music and live performances met with censure from critics; he also faced condemnation from the Musicians&#x27; Union (MU), who said he was putting &quot;proper&quot; musicians out of work. Andy McCluskey of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) observed &quot;nasty, &quot;nasty&quot;, vitriolic journalism&quot; directed at Numan, who was dismissed as &quot;pretentious&quot; and &quot;pseudo-intellectual&quot;. He nevertheless generated an army of fans calling themselves &quot;Numanoids&quot;, providing him with a fanbase which maintained their support through the latter half of the 1980s, when his fortunes began to fall. He maintains a cult following and has sold over 10 million records.

Numan is considered a pioneer of electronic music; &quot;Nightshift&quot; identified Numan, and fellow late 1970s debutants OMD and the Human League, as &quot;the holy trinity of synth-pop&quot;. He has been credited as a key influence by fellow English musician Kim Wilde as she was working on her debut single &quot;Kids in America&quot; with her brother Ricky. Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal of Tears for Fears, another new wave act of the 1980s, cited Numan&#x27;s style as one that inspired them while recording their debut studio album &quot;The Hurting&quot;. Since the 1990s Numan has been cited as a major influence by a variety of bands and artists from hip hop to industrial rock and Britpop, including Afrika Bambaataa, Fear Factory, Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, Stephin Merritt of Magnetic Fields and Damon Albarn of Blur. Prince was quoted saying: &quot;There are still people trying to work out what a genius Gary Numan is.&quot;

Fear Factory produced a cover of &quot;Cars&quot; (featuring a prominent guest appearance by Numan himself) for the digipak version of their third studio album, &quot;Obsolete&quot; (1999). Numan had become acknowledged and respected by his peers, with such musicians as Dave Grohl (of Foo Fighters, with whom he covered &quot;Down in the Park&quot; on 1996&#x27;s &quot;Songs in the Key of X&quot;, and Nirvana), Trent Reznor (of Nine Inch Nails, whose 2018 leg of the &quot;Cold and Black and Infinite&quot; tour concluded with a guest performance by Numan, who Reznor described as &quot;vitally important and a huge inspiration&quot;), and Marilyn Manson (who released his own cover version of &quot;Down in the Park&quot; as the B-side of his band&#x27;s 1995 studio album &quot;Lunchbox&quot;) proclaiming his work an influence.

The duo Basement Jaxx had a hit in 2002 with &quot;Where&#x27;s Your Head At&quot;, which relied on a sample of Numan&#x27;s &quot;M.E.&quot;—from &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot;—for its hook. Nine Inch Nails covered the song &quot;Metal&quot; on &quot;The Fragile&quot; remix album &quot;Things Falling Apart,&quot; as did Afrika Bambaataa (with Numan himself) on the studio album &quot;Dark Matter Moving at the Speed of Light&quot;. &quot;Cars&quot; remains Numan&#x27;s most enduring song; it was a hit again in 1987 (remixed by Zeus B. Held) and 1996, in the latter case thanks to an appearance in an advert for Carling Brewery. In 2000, DJ Armand van Helden sampled the track in his single &quot;Koochy&quot;. In 2002, English girl group the Sugababes scored a No. 1 with &quot;Freak Like Me&quot;, a mashup of Adina Howard&#x27;s &quot;Freak Like Me&quot; and &quot;Are &quot;Friends&quot; Electric?&quot; by Numan&#x27;s Tubeway Army.

== Personal life ==
From early in his career Numan was very close to his family. His father Tony was his manager for many years, his musician brother John became a member of his backing band and his mother Beryl was also frequently involved doing various things behind the scenes, such as running Numan&#x27;s fan club and manage the reception at his Rock City studio.

In 1997, Numan married Gemma O&#x27;Neill, a member of his fan club from Sidcup, south-east London. They have three daughters. One daughter, at the age of 11, contributed vocals to Numan&#x27;s 2017 song &quot;My Name Is Ruin&quot; and appeared in its music video. Numan and his family lived in Essex, then Heathfield and Waldron in East Sussex, and in October 2012 moved to Santa Monica, California, US.

At age 15, after a series of outbursts in which he would &quot;smash things up, scream and shout, get in people&#x27;s faces and break stuff&quot;, Numan was prescribed antidepressants and anxiolytics. In the 1990s, his wife suggested he had Asperger syndrome; after reading about the syndrome and taking a series of online tests, he agreed. It was discussed when he was younger, though he was not confident in the diagnostic criteria of the time. Conversely, he said in an April 2018 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; that he had been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome at the age of 14. In a 2001 interview, he said, &quot;Polite conversation has never been one of my strong points. Just recently I actually found out that I&#x27;d got a mild form of Asperger&#x27;s syndrome which basically means I have trouble interacting with people. For years, I couldn&#x27;t understand why people thought I was arrogant, but now it all makes more sense.&quot;

Numan published his autobiography, &quot;Praying to the Aliens&quot;, in 1997 (updated in 1998), in collaboration with Steve Malins, who also wrote the liner notes for most of the CD reissues of Numan&#x27;s albums in the late 1990s, as well as executive producing the &quot;Hybrid&quot; album in 2003. An updated autobiography, &quot;(R)evolution: The Autobiography&quot;, was published on 22 October 2020 and brings his career up to date from the earlier &quot;Praying to the Aliens&quot;.

Numan is an atheist.

He was an outspoken supporter of the Conservative Party and Margaret Thatcher after her election as Prime Minister. He later expressed regret for giving his public support, calling it &quot;a noose around my neck&quot;. He has previously said that he considers himself neither left- nor right-wing and that he did not support Tony Blair or David Cameron. He also said, &quot;I&#x27;m not socialist, I know that. I don&#x27;t believe in sharing my money.&quot; Numan is not overly politically engaged and distances himself from political commentary.

== Aviation career ==
Numan joined the Air Training Corps as a teenager, when he wanted to be either a pilot or a pop star. In 1978, he started learning to fly at Blackbushe Airport, but the success of his music career in 1979 meant that obtaining his pilot&#x27;s licence was delayed until 17 December 1980. The following day; 18 December 1980, Numan bought his first aeroplane for £12,000; a Cessna 182 Skylane. On 1 July 1981, Numan founded Numanair, a small charter flight company operating from Blackbushe, and acquired a Cessna 210 Centurion (registered G-OILS) and a Piper PA-31 Navajo (registered G-NMAN). He also indulged his passion for motor racing in 1981 by sponsoring Mike Mackonochie who drove a Van Diemen RF81 in Numanair livery in the Formula Ford 1600 class.

In November and December 1981, Numan successfully flew around the world in his Piper PA-31 Navajo with co-pilot Bob Thompson on their second attempt. The first attempt, in the Cessna 210 Centurion, had ended in India with Numan and Thompson being arrested on suspicion of smuggling and spying. This aircraft was written off on 29 January 1982 when it ran out of fuel near Southampton and made a forced landing while Numan was a passenger.

In 1984, Numan bought a Harvard T-6 trainer aircraft registered G-AZSC and had the aircraft painted to resemble a Japanese &quot;Zero&quot; fighter. He also gained a display pilot&#x27;s licence and flew the machine on the UK air display circuit. He and friend Norman Lees, who also owned a Harvard, formed the Radial Pair, performing synchronised aerobatics from the 1992 air display season. Later they teamed up with other Harvard owners to fly up to five aircraft as the Harvard Formation Team with Numan choreographing their aerobatic routines.

Numan held licences for piston and turbine helicopters and had a fixed wing multi engined rating. He was an aerobatic flying instructor and was appointed by the Civil Aviation Authority as an air display pilot evaluator. Then in 2005, after several of his friends and colleagues were killed in unrelated flying accidents, he gave up flying. In an interview in 2009 he said &quot;I loved going to air shows, you&#x27;d bond really tightly with your team mates – it&#x27;s an extreme thing to be doing, and you trust your life to them. And then it ended. I&#x27;d turn up and not know anyone. It got depressing. I&#x27;d sit down in the pilot&#x27;s tent and there&#x27;d be all these people I&#x27;d not recognise. You&#x27;d look forward to someone turning up to have a chat with them, and they&#x27;d be dead.&quot;

Numanair continued operating but after 31 years, with Numan and his family emigrating to the US, it was dissolved on 18 June 2013.

<text>Psion Organiser was the brand name of a range of pocket computers developed by the British company Psion in the 1980s. The Organiser I (launched in 1984) and Organiser II (launched in 1986) had a characteristic hard plastic sliding cover protecting a 6×6 keypad instead of a computer keyboard, with letters arranged alphabetically.

The Organiser II competed with the Filofax and can be considered the first usable electronic organizer or personal digital assistant (PDA) in that it combined an electronic diary and searchable address database in a small, portable device.

Production of consumer hand-held devices by Psion has now ceased; the company, after corporate changes, now concentrates on hardware and software for industrial and commercial data-collection applications.

On an episode of &quot;The Gadget Show&quot;, first aired 30 March 2009, the Psion was pitted against the BlackBerry for a place on the show&#x27;s Hall of Fame. Whilst the Psion was highly praised as a device that pioneered portable computing, host Jon Bentley ultimately gave the accolade to the BlackBerry.

As of autumn 2024 several software features and hardware devices are still being developed and are available including a JavaScript Emulator, Parallel Interface, USB Commslink, 32 kilobyte (KB) and 256 KB RAMpaks, and 512 KB FlashPak.

==Organiser I==

Launched in 1984, the Psion Organiser was the &quot;world&#x27;s first practical pocket computer&quot;. Based on an 8-bit Hitachi 6301-family processor, running at 0.9 MHz, with 4 KB of read-only memory (ROM) and 2 KB of static RAM and has a one-row monochrome liquid crystal display (LCD) screen. The size with the case closed is 142 × 78 × 29.3 mm, and the mass is 225 grams.

A &quot;Byte&quot; reviewer described the Organiser&#x27;s software as a &quot;clever design ... for fast and foolproof use&quot;. He approved of the consistent user interface across applications and reported that without documentation he was able to learn how to do everything except program in 15 minutes. The machine provided a simple flat-file database, calculator and clock, and had no operating system (OS). The Organiser I supported removable storage write once read many (write-once) devices, which used &quot;erasable programmable read-only memory&quot; EPROM storage. The device can host two of these, named Datapaks (stylized as DATAPAK, or simply PAK), to which it can write data, but which must be removed from the device and erased by exposure to ultraviolet light before they can be re-used. As Psion had patented the use of EPROMS as a storage device, it was impossible for other device makers to copy this unusual approach to mobile storage.

Software supplied on Datapak included a crude programming language named POPL, in which end-users could write their own programs. Software Datapaks titled Science, Maths and Finance contained the POPL programming language editor, interpreter and runtime system and extended the built-in calculator by adding named functions. These Datapaks also contained different sets of application software written in the POPL language.

A far more sophisticated programming tool was later made available with the implementation of the Forth language, but was available to registered professional developers rather than end users. The Psion Forth Development System for the Organiser I was a powerful set of IBM PC-based cross-development tools for producing Forth application software, including a Forth compiler. The Forth system on the Organiser I had a compiler to intermediate code, interpreter and runtime, and had several unusual design features one being that it could interpret – that is, read and execute – Forth intermediate code directly in place on a Datapak, rather than needing to copy it into precious RAM first, despite the Datapaks not being execute-in-place memory-mapped.

Software developed by Psion as part of the Organiser I project, and application software after its launch, was written in 6301 assembly language, in POPL, and in other custom-designed languages. Assembly language development at Psion was carried out using cross-development tools, including a cross assembler and linker, all of which ran on a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAX.

Application developers writing in 6301 assembly struggled with the small amount of RAM (2 KB) and the lack of an operating system. Another difficulty for developers was with the performance limits of the earliest Datapaks, which used a serial-access internal architecture, instead of random access. Retrieving, for example, byte 2000 from a Datapak meant issuing successive hardware commands to either step from the current read position one address place at time until position 2000 was reached or, in the worst case, resetting the read position to zero and then issuing a step-forward command 2000 times.

The Hitachi 6301 processor is an enhanced development based on the Motorola 6801 implemented in &quot;complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor&quot; (CMOS), with several extra instructions, various hardware system on a chip (SoC) facilities on-chip, power management and support for a sleep state. The particular variant chosen also had 4 KB of masked ROM on-chip, so an external ROM was unneeded on the board.

Having fully static RAM and a processor which clock could be frozen without losing state meant very long battery life, measured in weeks or even months. Minimal power use was aided by the processor being frozen whenever there was no work to do, plus a deeper sleep mode, which turned off the display.

The machine lacked a full independently battery-backed, date-time real-time hardware clock, instead it had a simple hardware counter. While the machine was sleeping, the counter counted 1,024 seconds and then woke the machine very briefly, so that software could add 1,024 seconds to a record of the time held in RAM. This meant that when sleeping the machine woke very fleetingly every 17 minutes 4 seconds.

The original 1984 price was £99 GBP or $199 CAD and included one Datapak and one software Datapak, the &quot;Utility&quot; pack. This latter adds scientific and trigonometric functions to the otherwise basic calculator routines.

==Organiser II==
In 1986, the successful Organiser II introduced many hardware improvements, a better keyboard and display, a much larger ROM and either 8 KB (CM Model), 16 or 32 KB (XP Model), 32 or 64 KB (later LZ Model) of battery-backed RAM, and featured a capable newly designed single-tasking operating system. The first Organiser II models featured a two-line display. The new model supported several different types of improved Datapaks, containing either EPROM or battery-backed RAM storage, each storing between 8 KB and 128 KB of data. Later &quot;electrically erasable programmable read-only memory&quot; (EEPROM) flashpaks, and random-access memory (RAM) RAMpaks, were added to the range, able to store up to 256 KB on each extension slot.

The machine had far more application functionality, including many built-in application programs, an easy-to-use database, a diary, and an alarm clock, and featured end-user programmability in the form of the successful then-named Organiser Programming Language (OPL), a BASIC-like language, which was compiled to intermediate code, in contrast to the interpreters, which were commonly available for other consumer computers of the time. More advanced users could edit the system machine-code routines, either by direct machine code or by calls from OPL, could manipulate the built-in address database, and create their own.

The Organiser II was widely used for commercial applications in companies such as Marks &amp; Spencer, where it was used on the shop floor, with their branding instead of Psion&#x27;s and with only limited keys visible to the end user. It was also used in the world&#x27;s first large-scale application of mobile technology in government, where over 3,000 were used for benefit calculations by the Employment Services department of the UK government. It proved popular with surveyors who interfaced it with electronic theodolites, which proved to be the precursor to the now popular total station.

The Organiser II also had an external device slot, into which various plug-in modules could be fitted, including a device that provided an RS-232 port (named &quot;CommsLink&quot;), thus enabling it to communicate with other devices or computers. This &quot;top slot&quot; also supported various other hardware additions, such as telephone dialers, a speech synthesiser, barcode reader, and a dedicated thermal printer. This latter was used by several banks as a counter-top exchange-rate calculator for some years. As it was easy to get hardware specifications, many bespoke devices were developed by small companies such as analog-to-digital converters (A/D) and even an interface to the full range of Mitutoyo measuring equipment, allowing it to be used in quality control for various car manufacturers. Later models in the Organiser II range offered other hardware improvements, with 4-line displays, and also models were introduced with 32, 64 and 96 KB RAM.

=== Post production enthusiasts and developments ===

In the autumn of 1996, when Psion PLC had moved their focus away from the Organiser II onto the newer clamshell series devices (below) and had almost ceased support for the Organiser II, Dave Woolnough created the &quot;Psion Organiser II Homepage&quot; to fill the gap, stating &quot;Considering that more than 500,000 series II Organisers were produced, there must be many people still using this wonderful machine&quot;. The original Org2.com In the summer of 1997, Jaap Scherphuis joined the site as software specialist and soon became fully responsible for maintaining the web pages on a day-to-day basis. Dave wrote about Scherphuis &quot;A Remarkable Psion Programmer&quot;. The Psion 2 archive had a large proportion of programmes written by Scherphuis, many written in machine code. In the spring of 2002 Boris Cornet took over as site maintainer/editor. Later that year he replaced the chat (bulletin board) with the now defunct Psion Organiser II Forum. When he died in 2012, the administrative duties for the forum were taken over by a power user MIKESAN who ran it until the spring of 2020 when he developed a terminal illness and the site became inaccessible. In January 2021 Olivier Gossuin, a Belgian enthusiast, launched a new Organiser II User Forum which in turn became inaccessible in 2022. In January 2023 a Canadian enthusiast Yves Martin provided space on his business server for a replacement forum with a long time enthusiast Martin Reid helping with the administration.

Another legacy that Boris Cornet left Organiser II users is &quot;Psi2Win&quot;, the Windows PC comms link server. This Windows-friendly server was developed using Jaaps&#x27; reverse engineered comms link protocol. Boris always considered his Comms Server &quot;Psi2Win&quot; to be in permanent state of &#x27;beta testing&#x27; but with his sad passing it is no longer being developed. With this in mind the author of ORG-link has further developed and released ORG-Link_V2 an Organiser II Comms Link Server that works in all Windows versions 32 and 64 bit. In the winter of 2013, Jaap created his web site with the aim &quot;to be an archive of Psion Organiser II information and software that might otherwise be abandoned and lost&quot;. Hardware developments have continued with Organiser II Forum enthusiasts creating periferals such as microUSB CommsLink, 256 KB RAMPak, 512 KB FlashPak, and microUSB Power Supply. These, with other Organiser II hardware and software, are still available from the West Yorkshire Psion Store. Massimo Cellin created the Psion Facebook group in the autumn of 2015, servicing all the Psion products including the Organiser II. Members of the Facebook group include the former editor of IPSO FACTO, the 1980s and 1990s newsletters of the International Psion Pocket Computers User Group, copies of which are still available from Scherphuis&#x27; archive.

** LA model still carried the XP label on its casing

In addition to the above, many other industrial, one-off and special edition models were released, including a special edition with transparent housing. Some of these models have radically different keyboard layouts.

==Subsequent hand-held devices==
The name &quot;Organiser&quot; was not used for later Psion handhelds, such as the &quot;SIxteen-Bit Organiser&quot; (SIBO) family Psion MC400 laptop, the Psion Series 3 and the 32-bit Psion Series 5 machines, which were of a clamshell design with a QWERTY keyboard. As to hardware architecture and operating system, these had no links to the earlier &quot;Organiser&quot; range, other than the end-user programming language, which shared a great deal of structure with OPL.

The SIBO family, and the improved version of the OPL language (with window and focus controls), was replaced in 1997 by a new ARM architecture-based operating system EPOC32 written in C++; the latter was later sold as the Symbian operating system, which until 2010 was the most widely used OS in smartphones, being in 2011 displaced by Google&#x27;s Android OS. This change was more significant than appeared at the time. The consumer-grade high-level programming language still shares features with OPL, but the developer toolkits were from then on focused on programmers familiar with C and only the Symbian operating system remains.

The first similar device made in the USA did not appear until 1985 and was manufactured by Validec.

<doc id="46016" wikidata="Q1756771" url="?curid=46016" title="Psion (company)">
<text>Psion PLC was a designer and manufacturer of mobile handheld computers for commercial and industrial uses. The company was headquartered in London, England, with major operations in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, and other company offices in Europe, the United States, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. It was a public company listed on the London Stock Exchange () and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

Psion&#x27;s operational business was formed in September 2000 from a merger of Psion and Canadian-based Teklogix Inc., and was a global provider of solutions for mobile computing and wireless data collection. The Group&#x27;s products and services included rugged mobile hardware, secure software and wireless networks, professional services, and support programs. Psion worked with its clients in the area of burgeoning technologies, including imaging, voice recognition, and radio-frequency identification (RFID). They had operations worldwide in 14 countries, and customers in more than 80 countries.

Formed in 1980, Psion first achieved success as a consumer hardware company that developed the Psion Organiser and a wide range of more sophisticated clamshell personal digital assistants (PDAs). Psion either closed or disposed of all its prior operations and then focused on rugged mobile computing systems. It withdrew from the consumer device market in 2001. Motorola Solutions announced in June 2012 that it had agreed to acquire Psion for $200 million.

==History==

=== Beginnings (1980–1984) ===
Psion was established in 1980 as a software house with a close relationship with Sinclair Research. The company developed games and other software for the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum home computers, released under the Sinclair/Psion brand. Psion&#x27;s games for the ZX Spectrum included &quot;Chess&quot;, &quot;Chequered Flag&quot;, &quot;Flight Simulation&quot; and the &quot;Horace&quot; series. Psion Chess was later ported to other platforms, including the early Macintosh in 1984.

Early software releases for the ZX Spectrum included titles such as VU-Calc, VU-File and VU-3D, along with dozens of other titles.

The company name is an acronym standing for &quot;Potter Scientific Instruments&quot;, after the company&#x27;s founder, David Potter. The acronym PSI was already in use elsewhere in the world so &quot;ON&quot; was added to make the name unique. Potter remained managing director until 1999 and was chairman of the company until late 2009.

In early 1983, Sinclair approached Psion regarding the development of a suite of office applications for the forthcoming Sinclair QL personal computer. Psion were already working on a project in this area, and when the QL was launched in 1984 it was bundled with &quot;Quill&quot;, &quot;Archive&quot;, &quot;Abacus&quot; and &quot;Easel&quot;; respectively a word processor, database, spreadsheet, and business graphics application. These were later ported to DOS and made available for the IBM PC and ACT&#x27;s Sirius and Apricot computers, collectively called &quot;PC-Four&quot;, or &quot;Xchange&quot; in an enhanced version. &quot;Xchange&quot; was also available for ICL&#x27;s One Per Desk computer, which was based on the QL.

=== Psion Organiser (1984) ===
In 1984, Psion first entered the hardware market with the Psion Organiser, an early handheld computer, in appearance resembling a pocket calculator with an alphanumeric computer keyboard. In 1986, the vastly improved Psion Organiser II was released, and was assembled by Speedboard Assembly Services. Its success led the company into a decade long period of &quot;Psion&quot; Computer and operating system development. It included the simple-to-use Open Programming Language (OPL) for database programming, which sparked a large independent software market. 

===EPOC (1987)===
In 1987, Psion began developing its &quot;SIxteen Bit Organiser&quot; (SIBO) family of devices and its own new multitasking operating system named EPOC, to run its third generation product, Laptops (MC), industrial handhelds (HC and Workabout) and PDA (Series 3) products.

It is often rumoured that EPOC stands for &quot;Electronic Piece Of Cheese&quot; however Colly Myers, who was Symbian&#x27;s CEO from founding until 2002, said in an interview that it stood for &#x27;epoch&#x27; and nothing more. This development effort produced the clamshell QWERTY-based Psion Series 3 palmtops (1993–98), which sold in the hundreds of thousands, and the Psion MC-series laptops, which sold poorly compared to the DOS-based laptops of the era.
A second effort, dubbed Project Protea, produced the Psion Series 5 for sale in 1997, a completely new product from the 32-bit hardware upwards through the OS, UI, and applications. It is still remembered for its high quality keyboard which, despite its size, allowed for touch-typing. However, the new feel of the product, and the removal of certain familiar quirks, alienated loyal Series 3 users, who tended to stick with their PDAs rather than upgrade.

In 1999, Psion released the Psion Series 7, which was much like a larger version of the Series 5, but with a double-size VGA-resolution screen that featured 256 colours (the Series 5 had a half-VGA screen with 16 grey shades). It was followed by the very similar Psion netBook.

Psion was being challenged by the arrival of cheaper PDAs such as the Palm Pilot, and PocketPCs running Microsoft&#x27;s Windows CE, and in 2003, Psion released a Netbook Pro running Windows CE .NET 4.2 instead of EPOC.

=== Symbian and telephony (1998) ===
The 32-bit EPOC developed by Project Protea resulted in the eventual formation of Symbian Ltd. in June 1998 in conjunction with Nokia, Ericsson and Motorola. The OS was renamed the Symbian Operating System and was envisioned as the base for a new range of smartphones. Psion transferred 130 key staff to the new company and retained a 31% shareholding in the spun-out business. By 2007, the Symbian operating system powered around 125 million mobile phones, including many Nokia models and the Sony Ericsson P900 series.

Psion had previously sought to expand into mobile telephony itself, having engaged in talks to acquire Amstrad – mainly for its Dancall subsidiary – in 1996. Although Amstrad&#x27;s owner and founder, Alan Sugar, had reportedly been seeking to sell the entire business, no agreement could apparently be made on a price or on &quot;a plan for the disposal of the other parts of the Amstrad Group&quot;. This setback left Psion promising &quot;to introduce GSM-based products during 1997&quot;. Meanwhile, Psion did license EPOC to Digital Equipment Corporation so that the system could be ported to Digital&#x27;s StrongARM processor.

The development of new and updated products by Psion slowed after the Symbian spin-off. Other products failed or had limited success; these included Psion Siemens&#x27; GSM device, a Series 5 based set-top box, the Wavefinder DAB radio, and an attempt to add Dragon&#x27;s speech recognition software to a PDA. Ericsson cancelled a Series 5MX derived smartphone project in 2001.

Psion had sold its sole manufacturing plant in 1999 and started to withdraw from its PDA markets in late 2001, shedding 250 of 1,200 staff and writing-off £40 million. The PDA, which was once a niche market, had become a global horizontal marketplace where it was difficult for Psion to compete. The final blow for Psion&#x27;s Organiser and PDA business came in January 2001 when Motorola pulled out of a joint project with Psion, Samsung, and Parthus, to create &quot;Odin&quot;, an ARM-based PDA-phone.

In 2000, Psion acquired Teklogix of Canada for £240 million, and merged its business-to-business division, Psion Enterprise, with the newly acquired company. Teklogix was rebranded Psion Teklogix, and this division formed the core of Psion Plc&#x27;s business.

In 2002, Psion launched the Psion Software division. This business developed push email solutions for Symbian smartphones, Microsoft Exchange and Lotus Notes. This business was sold to Visto of the United States in 2003.

In 2004, Psion disposed of the company&#x27;s remaining Symbian shareholding to Nokia, as they no longer regarded it as a core part of their strategy.

=== Last years (2010–2012) ===
In its last years, Psion made tailored and customized modular variants of its products through its online community, Ingenuity Working. Launched in March 2010, Ingenuity Working had more than 35,000 visitors per month within its first six months.

In January 2011, the launched a new logo, simultaneously removing Teklogix from its operating company name.

Motorola Solutions announced in June 2012 that it had agreed to acquire Psion for $200 million.

== &quot;Netbook&quot; trademark litigation ==
Psion registered the trademark &quot;Netbook&quot; in various territories, including the European Union and , which was applied for on 18 December 1996 and registered by USPTO on 21 November 2000. They used this trademark for the Psion netBook product, discontinued in November 2003, and from October 2003, the NETBOOK PRO, later also discontinued.

Intel started using the term &quot;netbook&quot; in March 2008 as a generic term to describe &quot;small laptops that are designed for wireless communication and access to the Internet&quot;, believing they were &quot;not offering a branded line of computers here&quot; and &quot;see no naming conflict&quot;.

In response to the growing use of the term, on 23 December 2008 Psion Teklogix sent cease and desist letters to various parties including enthusiast website(s) demanding they no longer use the term &quot;netbook&quot;.

In early 2009, Intel sued Psion Teklogix (US &amp; Canada) and Psion (UK) in the Federal Court, seeking a cancellation of the trademark and an order enjoining Psion from asserting any trademark rights in the term &quot;netbook&quot;, a declarative judgement regarding their use of the term, attorneys&#x27; fees, costs and disbursements and &quot;such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper&quot;. The suit was settled out of court, and on 2 June 2009 Psion announced that the company was withdrawing all of its trademark registrations for the term &quot;Netbook&quot; and that Psion agreed to &quot;waive all its rights against third parties in respect of past, current or future use&quot; of the term.

Similar marks were rejected by the USPTO citing a &quot;likelihood of confusion&quot; under section 2(d), including &#x27;G NETBOOK&#x27; ( rejected 31 October 2008), Micro-Star International&#x27;s (MSI) &#x27;WIND NETBOOK&#x27; () and Coby Electronics&#x27; &#x27;COBY NETBOOK&#x27; ( rejected 13 January 2009)

== Integration with Linux ==
Psion had a lengthy, but distant, interest in Linux as an operating system on its electronic devices. In 1998, it supported the Linux7K project that had been initiated by Ed Bailey at Red Hat, which was to port Linux to its Series 5 personal computer. The project was named after the Cirrus Logic PS-7110 chip of the Series 5. Although this project was one of the earliest attempts to port Linux to a handheld computer, it did not come to fruition for Psion. The project soon transitioned to an informal open-source software project at Calcaria.net that kept the name Linux7K. After the project transitioned again to sourceforge.net, the project&#x27;s name was changed to a more general name &quot;PsiLinux&quot;, and later to &quot;OpenPsion&quot;. The project has developed Linux kernels and file systems for the Revo, Series 5 and 5MX, and Series 7 and netBook.

In 2003–4, Psion Teklogix and its founder David Potter expressed interest in Linux as the operating system for its devices as it divested from Symbian. However, the only result of that interest was Linux as the operating system on a limited number of custom NetBook Pros designed for a hospital setting.

The Embeddable Linux Kernel Subset project has produced a small subset of Linux that runs on Psion Series 3 PDAs.

==PDAs==
*Psion Organiser and Psion Organiser II
*Psion HC
*Psion Series 3, 3a, 3c &amp; 3mx
*Psion Siena

<doc id="46021" wikidata="Q1818402" url="?curid=46021" title="Rambouillet Agreement">
<text>The Rambouillet Agreement, formally the Interim Agreement for Peace and Self-Government in Kosovo, was a proposed peace agreement between the delegation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia on the one hand and the delegation of political representatives of the ethnic Albanian majority population of Kosovo on the other. It was drafted by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and named for the Château de Rambouillet, where it was initially proposed in early 1999. Among other things, the accords called for 30,000 NATO peacekeeping troops in Kosovo; an unhindered right of passage for NATO troops on Yugoslav territory; and immunity for NATO and its agents to Yugoslav law. The Kosovo Albanian side signed the agreement on 18 March 1999, however the refusal of the Yugoslav and Serbian side to sign the accords led to the 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia.

== Provisions ==
The provisions of the agreement included:

# &quot;Kosovo will have a president, prime minister, and government, an assembly, its own Supreme Court, constitutional court and other courts.&quot;
# &quot;Kosovo will have the authority to make laws not subject to revision by Serbia or the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, including levying taxes, instituting programs of economic, scientific, technological, regional and social development, conducting foreign relations within its area of responsibility in the same manner as a Republic.&quot; 
# &quot;Yugoslav army forces and Serb security forces will withdraw completely from Kosovo, except for a limited border guard force (active only within a 5 kilometer border zone).&quot;
# &quot;The parties invite NATO to deploy a military force (KFOR), which will be authorized to use necessary force to ensure compliance with the accords.&quot;
# &quot;The international community will play a role in ensuring that these provisions are carried out through a Civilian Implementation Mission (CIM) appointed by NATO&quot;.
# &quot;The Chief of the CIM has the authority to issue binding directives to the Parties on all important matters he sees fit, including appointing and removing officials and curtailing institutions.&quot;
# &quot;Three years after the implementation of the Accords, an international meeting will be convened to determine a mechanism for a final settlement for Kosovo on the basis of the will of its People.&quot; 
# &quot;NATO personnel shall enjoy, together with their vehicles, vessels, aircraft, and equipment, free and unrestricted passage and unimpeded access throughout the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia including associated airspace and territorial waters. This shall include, but not be limited to, the right of bivouac, maneuver, billet and utilization of any areas or facilities as required for support, training, and operations.&quot;
# &quot;NATO is granted the use of airports roads, rails, and ports without payment of fees, duties, dues, tolls, or charges occasioned by mere use.&quot;
# &quot;Yugoslavia and Kosovo shall, upon simple request, grant all telecommunications services, including broadcast services, needed for the Operation, as determined by NATO, This shall include the right to utilize such means and services as required to assure full ability to communicate and the right to use all of the electromagnetic spectrum for this purpose, free of cost.&quot;
# &quot;In the conduct of the Operation, NATO may need to make improvements or modifications to certain infrastructure in the FRY, such as roads, bridges, tunnels, buildings, and utility systems.&quot;
# &quot;NATO shall be immune from all legal process, whether civil, administrative, or criminal.&quot;
# &quot;NATO personnel, under all circumstances and at all times, shall be immune from the Parties, jurisdiction in respect of any civil, administrative, criminal or disciplinary offenses which may be committed by them in the FRY.&quot;
# &quot;NATO personnel shall be immune from any form of arrest, investigation, or detention by the authorities in the FRY.&quot;

==Proposed autonomy for Kosovo==

The Rambouillet Agreement included provisions for creating a system of democratic self-governance in Kosovo. It would have established three branches of government, a system of local government and law enforcement institutions.

===Competencies===

Kosovo would have the authority to make laws in areas it has competence including levying taxes, instituting programs of economic, scientific, technological, regional and social development, and could conduct foreign relations within its area of responsibility in the same manner as a republic within the federation.

The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would have competency over territorial integrity, maintaining a common market, monetary policy, defense, foreign policy, customs services, federal taxation, and federal elections. Serbia would have competence republic level elections in Kosovo. Kosovo would be entitled to at least 10 seats in the federal parliament and at least 20 seats in the Serbian parliament. The federal government would maintain border crossings at Kosovo&#x27;s external borders with Albania and North Macedonia and would exercise authority in connection with the enforcement of federal immigration laws.

===Legislative branch===
Kosovo was to have an 120 member assembly of which 80 would be directly elected. Of the remaining 40 members, 10 would be elected by communities representing between 0.5 and 5% and 30 would be shared equally between the Albanian and Serb communities. The assembly would be led by a president, two vice-presidents.

===Executive branch===
Kosovo would have had a president elected by the assembly for a three year term renewable once. Executive power would be exercised by a government led by a prime minister, proposed by the president and confirmed by the assembly.

===Judicial branch===
Kosovo was to have a constitutional court, a supreme court, district courts, and communal courts. The constitutional court and supreme court would each have 9 judges. An office of the prosecutor, led by a chief prosecutor, would be responsible for prosecuting individuals who violate the criminal laws of Kosovo. With the exception of immigration and customs related crimes, any person arrested within Kosovo would subject to the jurisdiction of the Kosovo courts. The rights and freedoms set forth in the European Convention on Human Rights would apply directly in Kosovo. An ombudsman institution would be established to protect human and community rights in Kosovo.

===Local government===
Kosovo&#x27;s existing communes would continue to exist and would elect their own assemblies and executive councils.

===Law enforcement===
Communal police units would be established throughout Kosovo with responsibility police patrols, crime prevention, criminal investigations, arrest and detention of criminal suspects, crowd control, and traffic control. Communal police officers may be equipped with a sidearm, handcuffs, a baton, and, a radio and would be required to wear a badge, picture identification, and name tag. Each unit would be led by a communal commander, appointed by the local communal assembly. A criminal justice administration would be established to coordinate law enforcement operations across Kosovo.

== Negotiating parties==

The negotiations were chaired by British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and French Foreign Minister Hubert Védrine. At times, US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer also took part in the talks.

Three parties were involved in the negotiations:

*the Contact Group, which included representatives from the United States, the European Union and Russia; Christopher Hill for the US, Wolfgang Petritsch for the EU and Boris Majorski for Russia).

*the 16-member delegation of Kosovo Albanians: Hashim Thaçi (leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army), Ibrahim Rugova (the leader of the ethnic Albanian community in Kosovo), philosophy professor and Rugova confidant Fehmi Agani, journalist Veton Surroi, Rexhep Qosja, KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi, former Rugova employee and KLA representative Ram Buja, among others.

*the delegation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was initially led by Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Ratko Marković before Serbian President Milan Milutinović took over the leadership when he joined the delegation at the beginning of the second week of negotiations, on 13 February. The deligation included Federal Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Šainović, Federal Deputy Prime Minister Vladan Kutlešić, Serbian Deputy Government Spokesman Vladimir Stambuk, Chairman of the Socialist Party in Kosovo Vojislav Živković, Member of the Kosovo and Methoja Provisional Executive Council Guljbehar Sabović, the representative of the national Muslim community Refik Senadović, the representative of the Turkish national community and the Turkish Democratic Party Zejnelabidin Kurejs, representative of the national community of the Gorans Ibro Vait, President of the Kosovo Democratic Initiative Faik Jasari, President of the Democratic Reform Party of Albanians Sokolj Cuse, the representative of the Roma national community Ljuan Koka, the representative of the Egyptian national community Cerim Abazi.

==Negotiations==
===Rambouillet===
On 23 February 1999, the co-chairmen Robin Cook and Hubert Védrine of the negotiation process put out a statement saying that the negotiations &quot;have led to a consensus&quot; on substantial autonomy for Kosovo, including on mechanisms for free and fair elections to democratic institutions, for the governance of Kosovo, for the protection of human rights and the rights of members of national communities; and for the establishment of a fair judicial system&quot;. They went on to say that &quot;a political framework is now in place&quot; leaving the further work of finalizing &quot;the implementation Chapters of the Agreement, including the modalities of the invited international civilian and military presence in Kosovo&quot;.
However, this assessment was at best overly optimistic, and at worst absolutely ignored the divergence of interests between the two major parties. The Albanians were unwilling to accept a solution that would retain Kosovo as part of Serbia, while the Serbs did not want to see the pre-1990 status quo restored, and they were implacably opposed to any international role in the governance of the province, including the offer of a face-saving measure wherein blue-helmeted UN peacekeeping troops would be used instead of NATO troops. To add to the problem, the NATO Contact Group countries were desperate to avoid having to make good on their threat of force—Greece and Italy were opposed to the idea. Consequently, when the talks failed to achieve an agreement by the original deadline of 19 February, they were extended by another month.

===Paris===
In the end, on 18 March 1999, the Kosovo Albanian, American and British delegation signed what became known as the &#x27;Rambouillet Accords&#x27; while the Serbian and Russian delegations refused. The accords called for NATO administration of Kosovo as an autonomous region within Yugoslavia; a force of 30,000 NATO troops to maintain order in Kosovo; an unhindered right of passage for NATO troops on Yugoslav territory, including Kosovo; and immunity for NATO and its agents to Yugoslav law. In addition, NATO forces would have the right to use local roads, ports, railways, and airports without payment of duties, dues, tolls or charges, as well as the right to use the electromagnetic spectrum without payment. NATO would also have the right to requisition public facilities for its use free of cost. NATO forces would have the right to hire local personnel who upon employment with NATO would be exempt from local laws in respect to acts performed in their official capacity, national service obligations, local labor laws, and taxes on their salaries. Local infrastructure would be subjected to improvements or modifications to by NATO forces when deemed necessary to facilitate the mission. 
According to Tim Judah, the Serbian side used Annex B only later on as a reason for the failure of talks; at the time, the Serbs rejected any discussion of the involvement of foreign troops, let alone the extensive rights that would have been afforded them by Annex B.

===Signing===
The agreement was signed by Ibrahim Rugova, Hashim Thaçi, Rexhep Qosja and Veton Surroi on behalf of &quot;Kosovo&quot; in the presence of Christopher Hill and Wolfgang Petritsch on 18 March 1999. The delegation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia did not sign the agreement.

===Aftermath===
Events proceeded rapidly after the failure at Rambouillet. The international monitors from the OSCE were withdrawn on 22 March for fear of the monitors&#x27; safety ahead of the anticipated bombing by NATO. On 23 March, the Serbian assembly issued a resolution that condemned the withdrawal of the OSCE monitors, and accepted the principle of &quot;autonomy&quot; for Kosovo and non-military part of the agreement.

NATO leaders had expected that a brief bombing campaign would lead to Serb forces withdrawing from Kosovo, hence ending the humanitarian crisis; but Milošević may have gambled that his government and armed forces could withstand a few days of bombing without serious harm.

==Reactions==
In commentary released to the press, former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger declared that:

 The historian Christopher Clark supports this view, asserting that the terms of the 1914 Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia appear lenient compared to the NATO demands.

A former hand on the State Department&#x27;s Yugoslavia desk, George Kenney, reported in May 1999 that a senior State Department official had briefed journalists off the record that &quot;[we] deliberately set the bar higher than the Serbs could accept&quot;.

For the Serbs, signing the Rambouillet agreement would actually have been signing away all Serbian sovereignty over Kosovo. It was not even a &quot;take it or leave it&quot; proposition, as Secretary of State Albright emphasized back in February 1999; rather, it was &quot;sign it or get bombed.&quot; There were, in fact, no negotiations at all, and no sovereign, independent state would have signed the Rambouillet agreement.

Historian Noel Malcolm wrote that as the Kosovo Albanian delegation signed the agreement on the 18th, the Yugoslav delegation boycotted the ceremony and declared its opposition to the plan and that military maneuvers were being planned, so that by March 20 there were more than 26,000 Serbian troops inside the province and another 15,000 stationed just beyond its eastern border.

<doc id="46023" wikidata="Q912994" url="?curid=46023" title="Speaker of the United States House of Representatives">
<text>The speaker of the United States House of Representatives, commonly known as the speaker of the House or House speaker, is the presiding officer of the United States House of Representatives, the lower chamber of the United States Congress. The office was established in 1789 by Article I, Section II, of the U.S. Constitution. By custom and House rules, the speaker is the political and parliamentary leader of the House and is simultaneously its presiding officer, &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the body&#x27;s majority party, and the institution&#x27;s administrative head. Speakers also perform various other administrative and procedural functions. Given these several roles and responsibilities, the speaker usually does not personally preside over debatesthat duty is instead delegated to members of the House from the majority partynor regularly participate in floor debates.

The Constitution does not explicitly require the speaker to be an incumbent member of the House of Representatives, although every speaker thus far has been, and as a member the speaker also represents their district and retains the right to vote. The speaker is second in the United States presidential line of succession, after the vice president and ahead of the president pro tempore of the Senate.

The 56th and current speaker of the House is Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana.

== Selection ==
The House elects its speaker at the beginning of a new Congress, , after a general election, or when a speaker dies, resigns, or is removed from the position during a congressional term. At the start of a new Congress, those voting to elect the speaker are representatives-elect, as a speaker must be selected before members are sworn in to office; the House of Representatives cannot organize or take other legislative actions until a speaker is elected.

Since 1839, the House has elected speakers by roll call vote. In practice, each party&#x27;s caucus or conference selects a candidate for the speakership from among its senior leaders prior to the roll call. To be elected speaker, a candidate must receive a majority of votes from the members present and voting. If no candidate wins a majority, the roll call is repeated until a speaker is elected. Representatives are free to vote for someone other than the candidate nominated by their party but generally do not, as the outcome of the election effectively demonstrates which party has the majority and consequently will organize the House.

Representatives who choose to vote for someone other than their party&#x27;s nominee usually vote for someone else in their party or vote &quot;present&quot;, in which case their vote does not count in tallying the vote positively or negatively. Anyone who votes for the other party&#x27;s candidate could face serious consequences, as was the case when Democrat James Traficant voted for Republican Dennis Hastert in 2001 (107th Congress). In response, the Democrats stripped him of his seniority, and he lost all of his committee posts.

Upon election, the new speaker is sworn in by the dean of the United States House of Representatives, the chamber&#x27;s longest-serving member. Additionally, it is customary for the outgoing speaker, or the minority leader, to hand the speaker&#x27;s gavel to the new speaker, as a mark of the peaceful transition of power.

===Eligibility of non-members===
While every speaker of the House has been a sitting House member, Article I, Section II, Clause 5, of the U.S. Constitution, concerning the choosing of a speaker, does not explicitly state House membership as a requirement. As noted by the Congressional Research Service, non-members have, on multiple occasions since 1997, received votes in speaker elections. In 1787, while the proposed Constitution was being considered, Pennsylvania Congress of the Confederation delegate Tench Coxe publicly wrote the following:

The house of representatives is not, as the Senate, to have a president chosen for them from without their body, but are to elect their speaker from their own number . . . .

Noting that the Vesting Clause of Article I, Section I states that &quot;All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives&quot;, political scientist Diana Schaub has argued, &quot;Legislative powers cannot be lodged in the hands of a non-legislative person. To do so would violate the fundamental purpose of Article [I] of the Constitution.&quot; Both Schaub and the CRS note that the Standing Rules and Orders of the House created by the 1st United States Congress provided that the Speaker would vote &quot;In all cases of ballot by the [H]ouse&quot;, while former House Intelligence Committee general counsel Michael Ellis and attorney Greg Dubinsky have argued that the speaker must be a House member because the Speaker performs various legislative functions that other House officers (such as the Sergeant at Arms and the Clerk) do not perform. 

Schaub and the CRS also note that the text of the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 assumes that the speaker is a House member in requiring the speaker&#x27;s resignation upon succession to the presidency due to the Ineligibility Clause of Article I, Section VI. The Ineligibility Clause provides that &quot;No ... Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States... and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of [the] House during his Continuance in Office.&quot; Along with political scientist Matthew J. Franck, Schaub, Ellis, and Dubinsky argue that permitting a Senator or an executive or judicial officer of the federal government to serve as a non-member Speaker would cause a significant breach of the constitutional separation of powers.

Schaub, Ellis, and Dubinsky also argue that permitting a non-member to serve as Speaker would effectively exempt Speakers from the eligibility requirements of the House Qualifications Clause of Article I, Section II and from being bound by an oath of office under the Oath or Affirmation Clause of Article VI as opposed to House members. The House Qualifications Clause requires that &quot;No person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty-five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States&quot;. The Oath or Affirmation Clause provides that &quot;The ... Representatives before mentioned... and all executive and judicial Officers ... of the United States... shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution&quot;. Pursuant to Article VI, the 1st United States Congress passed the Oath Administration Act (that remains in effect) which provides that &quot;...the oath or affirmation [required by the sixth article of the Constitution of the United States]… shall be administered ... to the Speaker&quot;.

Like the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;NLRB v. Noel Canning&quot; (2014), Ellis and Dubinsky cite an 1819 letter written by James Madison to Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals Judge Spencer Roane where Madison stated that &quot;difficulties and differences of opinion [arising] in expounding terms [and] phrases ... used [in the Constitution]... might require a regular course of practice to liquidate [and] settle the meaning of some of them.&quot; In holding in &quot;NLRB v. Noel Canning&quot; that the Recess Appointments Clause of Article II, Section II does not authorize the President to make appointments while the Senate is in &quot;pro forma&quot; sessions, the Supreme Court cited &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot; (1803) and &quot;McCulloch v. Maryland&quot; (1819) in concluding that &quot;The longstanding &#x27;practice of the government&#x27; ... can inform [the] determination of &#x27;what the law is.

===Speaker pro tempore===
Under the Rules of the House, the speaker may designate a member to serve as speaker pro tempore, acting as the body&#x27;s presiding officer in the speaker&#x27;s absence. In most instances, the speaker pro tempore designation lasts for no more than three legislative days, although in the case of illness of the speaker, the speaker pro tempore may serve for ten legislative days if the appointment is approved by the House.
Separately, a speaker pro tempore is designated in the event the office of the speaker is declared vacant. Under the current Rules of the House, at the start of their term, the speaker is required to create a secret ordered list of members to temporarily serve as speaker of the House if the speakership became vacant and to provide the clerk of the United States House of Representatives this list &quot;as soon as practicable after&quot; the election &quot;and whenever appropriate thereafter.&quot; The names are only revealed in the event of a vacancy (e.g., by the speaker&#x27;s death, resignation, incapacitation, or removal from office). This &quot;succession list&quot; procedure was created in 2003, following the September 11 attacks, to promote continuity of government. Rule I, clause 8, of the House Rules states the member whose name appears first on the list &quot;shall act as Speaker pro tempore until the election of a Speaker or a Speaker pro tempore.&quot; The speaker pro tempore is not in the line of succession for the presidency.

Following the removal of Kevin McCarthy as speaker in October 2023 on a motion to vacate (the first time in history that a speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives was successfully removed by the House), Patrick McHenry was revealed to be the first name on McCarthy&#x27;s list and became acting speaker. The intent of the rule was for the speaker pro tempore to serve for a short period, until the House elected a new speaker, but the House rules set no specific limit on the length of time that a member may be speaker pro tempore.

The designation of a speaker pro tempore for purposes of succession, and for purposes of serving as the body&#x27;s presiding officer in the speaker&#x27;s absence, is separate from the speaker&#x27;s designation of multiple members as speakers pro tempore for the purpose of allowing them to sign enrolled bills and joint resolutions. The House Rules state: &quot;With the approval of the House, the Speaker may appoint a Member to act as Speaker pro tempore only to sign enrolled bills and joint resolutions for a specified period of time.&quot; The list of the members with this duty (usually political allies of the speaker, or members from districts close to Washington and thus better able to hold &quot;pro forma&quot; sessions) is made public.

== History ==

The first speaker of the House, Frederick Muhlenberg of Pennsylvania, was elected to office on April 1, 1789, the day the House organized itself at the start of the 1st Congress. He served two non-consecutive terms in the speaker&#x27;s chair, 1789–1791 (1st Congress) and 1793–1795 (3rd Congress).

As the Constitution does not state the duties of the speaker, the speaker&#x27;s role has largely been shaped by rules and customs that evolved over time. Scholars are divided as to whether early speakers played largely ceremonial and impartial roles or whether they were more active partisan actors.

===19th century===
From early in its existence, the speaker&#x27;s primary function had been to keep order and enforce rules. The speakership was transformed into a position with power over the legislative process under Henry Clay (1811–1814, 1815–1820, and 1823–1825). In contrast to many of his predecessors, Clay participated in several debates and used his influence to procure the passage of measures he supported—for instance, the declaration of the War of 1812, and various laws relating to Clay&#x27;s &quot;American System&quot; economic plan. Furthermore, when no candidate received an Electoral College majority in the 1824 presidential election, causing the president to be elected by the House, Speaker Clay threw his support to John Quincy Adams instead of Andrew Jackson, thereby ensuring Adams&#x27; victory. Following Clay&#x27;s retirement in 1825, the power of the speakership once again began to decline, despite speakership elections becoming increasingly bitter. As the Civil War approached, several sectional factions nominated their own candidates, often making it difficult for any candidate to attain a majority. In 1855 and again in 1859, for example, the contest for speaker lasted for two months before the House achieved a result. Speakers tended to have very short tenures during this period. For example, from 1839 to 1863 there were eleven speakers, only one of whom served for more than one term. James K. Polk is the only speaker of the House who was later elected president of the United States.
Toward the end of the 19th century, the office of speaker began to develop into a very powerful one. At the time, one of the most important sources of the speaker&#x27;s power was his position as Chairman of the Committee on Rules, which, after the reorganization of the committee system in 1880, became one of the most powerful standing committees of the House. Furthermore, several speakers became leading figures in their political parties; examples include Democrats Samuel J. Randall, John Griffin Carlisle, and Charles F. Crisp, and Republicans James G. Blaine, Thomas Brackett Reed, and Joseph Gurney Cannon.

The power of the speaker was greatly augmented during the tenure of the Republican Thomas Brackett Reed (1889–1891, 1895–1899). &quot;Czar Reed&quot;, as he was called by his opponents, sought to end the obstruction of bills by the minority, in particular by countering the tactic known as the &quot;disappearing quorum&quot;. By refusing to vote on a motion, the minority could ensure that a quorum would not be achieved and that the result would be invalid. Reed, however, declared that members who were in the chamber but refused to vote would still count for the purposes of determining a quorum. Through these and other rulings, Reed ensured that the Democrats could not block the Republican agenda.

===20th century===
The speakership reached its apogee during the term of Republican Joseph Gurney Cannon (1903–1911). Cannon exercised extraordinary control over the legislative process. He determined the agenda of the House, appointed the members of all committees, chose committee chairmen, headed the Rules Committee, and determined which committee heard each bill. He vigorously used his powers to ensure that Republican proposals were passed by the House. In 1910, however, Democrats and several dissatisfied Republicans joined to strip Cannon of many of his powers, including the ability to name committee members and his chairmanship of the Rules Committee. Fifteen years later, Speaker Nicholas Longworth restored much, but not all, of the lost influence of the position.
One of the most influential speakers in history was Democrat Sam Rayburn. Rayburn had the most cumulative time as speaker in history, holding office from 1940 to 1947, 1949 to 1953, and 1955 to 1961. He helped shape many bills, working quietly in the background with House committees. He also helped ensure the passage of several domestic measures and foreign assistance programs advocated by Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman.

Rayburn&#x27;s successor, Democrat John W. McCormack (served 1962–1971), was a somewhat less influential speaker, particularly because of dissent from younger members of the Democratic Party. During the mid-1970s, the power of the speakership once again grew under Democrat Carl Albert. The Committee on Rules ceased to be a semi-independent panel, as it had been since 1910. Instead, it once again became an arm of the party leadership. Moreover, in 1975, the speaker was granted the authority to appoint a majority of the members of the Rules Committee. Meanwhile, the power of committee chairmen was curtailed, further increasing the relative influence of the speaker.

Albert&#x27;s successor, Democrat Tip O&#x27;Neill, was a prominent speaker because of his public opposition to the policies of President Ronald Reagan. O&#x27;Neill is the longest continuously serving speaker, from 1977 through 1987. He challenged Reagan on domestic programs and on defense expenditures. Republicans made O&#x27;Neill the target of their election campaigns in 1980 and 1982 but Democrats managed to retain their majorities in both years.

The roles of the parties reversed in 1994 when, after spending forty years in the minority, the Republicans regained control of the House with the &quot;Contract with America&quot;, an idea spearheaded by Minority Whip Newt Gingrich. 

Speaker Gingrich would regularly clash with Democratic President Bill Clinton, leading to the United States federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996, in which Clinton was largely seen to have prevailed. Gingrich&#x27;s hold on the leadership was weakened significantly by that and several other controversies, and he faced a caucus revolt in 1997. 

After the Republicans lost House seats in 1998 (although retaining a majority) he did not stand for a third term as speaker. His successor, Dennis Hastert, had been chosen as a compromise candidate since the other Republicans in the leadership were more controversial. 

Hastert, who had been serving in the House since 1986, became the longest serving Republican speaker (1999-2007). Hastert led the campaign to elect Tom DeLay, with whom he developed a close and effective partnership, as House Majority Whip.

===21st century===

The Republicans came out of the 2000 elections with a further reduced majority but made small gains in 2002 and 2004. The periods of 2001–2002 and 2003–2007 were the first times since 1953–1955 that there was single-party Republican leadership in Washington, interrupted from 2001 to 2003 as Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont left the Republican Party to become independent and caucused with Senate Democrats to give them a 51–49 majority.

In the 2006 midterm elections, the Democratic Party regained control of the House of Representatives. Nancy Pelosi was elected Speaker of the House, becoming the first woman to hold the position.

President Bush acknowledged Pelosi as the first woman in that position in the opening of his 2007 State of the Union Address .

John Boehner was elected speaker when the 112th Congress convened on January 5, 2011, and was re-elected twice, at the start of the 113th and 114th Congresses. On both of those occasions his remaining in office was threatened by the defection of several members from his own party who chose not to vote for him. Boehner&#x27;s tenure as speaker, which ended when he resigned from Congress in October 2015, was marked by multiple battles with the conservatives in his own party related to &quot;Obamacare&quot;, appropriations, among other political issues. This intra-party discord continued under Boehner&#x27;s successor, Paul Ryan.

When Republican leader John Boehner succeeded Pelosi as speaker in 2011, Pelosi remained the leader of the Democratic Party in the House of Representatives and served as House minority leader for eight years before she led her party to victory in the 2018 elections. Following the 2018 midterm elections which saw the election of a Democratic Party majority in the House, Nancy Pelosi was again elected speaker when the 116th Congress convened on January 3, 2019. In addition to being the first woman to hold the office, Pelosi became the first speaker to return to power since Sam Rayburn in the 1950s. Following the 2022 midterm elections which saw the election of a narrow Republican Party majority in the House, Pelosi did not seek a Democratic leadership post in the next Congress. The Democratic Caucus named her &quot;Speaker Emerita&quot;.

Kevin McCarthy then became the new Speaker of the House on January 7, 2023, after the longest multi-ballot speaker election since 1859. McCarthy was eventually removed as speaker on October 3, 2023, after a further split in the Republican caucus, with five House Freedom Caucus members voting against McCarthy, which when combined with votes of Democrats, resulted in the ouster of McCarthy. This was the first time in the history of the House of Representatives in which the Speaker of the House was successfully removed. Following a multi-day four-ballot election, Mike Johnson was elected speaker on October 25, 2023.

== Notable elections ==
Historically, there have been several controversial elections to the speakership, such as the contest of 1839. In that case, even though the 26th United States Congress convened on December 2, the House could not begin the speakership election until December 14 because of an election dispute in New Jersey known as the &quot;Broad Seal War&quot;. Two rival delegations, one Whig and the other Democrat, had been certified as elected by different branches of the New Jersey government. The problem was compounded by the fact that the result of the dispute would determine whether the Whigs or the Democrats held the majority. Neither party agreed to permit a speakership election with the opposite party&#x27;s delegation participating. Finally, it was agreed to exclude both delegations from the election and a speaker was finally chosen on December 17.

Another, more prolonged fight occurred in 1855 in the 34th United States Congress. The old Whig Party had collapsed but no single party had emerged to replace it. Candidates opposing the Democrats had run under a bewildering variety of labels, including Whig, Republican, American (Know Nothing), and simply &quot;Opposition&quot;. By the time Congress actually met in December 1855, most of the northerners were concentrated together as Republicans, while most of the southerners and a few northerners used the American or Know Nothing label. Opponents of the Democrats held a majority in House, with the party makeup of the 234 representatives being 83 Democrats, 108 Republicans, and 43 Know Nothings (primarily southern oppositionists). The Democratic minority nominated William Alexander Richardson of Illinois as speaker, but because of sectional distrust, the various oppositionists were unable to agree on a single candidate for speaker. The Republicans supported Nathaniel Prentice Banks of Massachusetts, who had been elected as a Know Nothing but was now largely identified with the Republicans. The southern Know Nothings supported first Humphrey Marshall of Kentucky, and then Henry M. Fuller of Pennsylvania. The voting went on for almost two months with no candidate able to secure a majority, until it was finally agreed to elect the speaker by plurality vote, and Banks was elected.

The House found itself in a similar dilemma when the 36th Congress met in December 1859. Although the Republicans held a plurality, the Republican candidate, John Sherman, was unacceptable to southern oppositionists due to his anti-slavery views, and once again the House was unable to elect a speaker. After Democrats allied with southern oppositionists to nearly elect the North Carolina oppositionist William N. H. Smith, Sherman finally withdrew in favor of compromise candidate William Pennington of New Jersey, a former Whig of unclear partisan loyalties, who was finally elected speaker on February 1, 1860.

In December 1923, at the start of the 68th Congress, Republican Frederick H. Gillett needed nine ballots to win reelection. Progressive Republicans had refused to support Gillett in the first eight ballots. Only after winning concessions from Republican conference leaders (a seat on the House Rules Committee and a pledge that requested House rules changes would be considered) did they agree to support him.

In 1997, several Republican congressional leaders tried to force Speaker Newt Gingrich to resign. However, Gingrich refused since that would have required a new election for speaker, which could have led to Democrats along with dissenting Republicans voting for Democrat Dick Gephardt (then minority leader) as speaker. After the 1998 midterm elections where the Republicans lost seats, Gingrich did not stand for re-election. The next two figures in the House Republican leadership hierarchy, Majority Leader Richard Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay chose not to run for the office. The chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Bob Livingston, declared his bid for the speakership, which was unopposed, making him speaker-designate. It was then revealed, by Livingston himself, who had been publicly critical of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s alleged perjury during his sexual harassment trial, that he had engaged in an extramarital affair. He opted to resign from the House, despite being urged to stay on by House Democratic leader Gephardt. Subsequently, the chief deputy whip Dennis Hastert was selected as speaker. The Republicans retained their majorities in the 2000, 2002, and 2004 elections.

The Democrats won a majority of seats in the 2006 midterm elections. On November 16, 2006, Nancy Pelosi, who was then minority leader, was selected as speaker-designate by House Democrats. When the 110th Congress convened on January 4, 2007, she was elected as the 52nd speaker by a vote of 233–202, becoming the first woman elected speaker of the House. Pelosi was reelected speaker in the 111th Congress, and again in the 116th and 117th Congresses.

The January 2023 speakership election occurred two months after the 2022 House elections in which the Republicans won a slim four-seat majority. Kevin McCarthy was nominated for speaker by the House Republican Conference but due to a division among the Republicans, no one received a majority of the votes on the first ballot, necessitating an additional round of balloting for the first time since 1923. McCarthy ultimately prevailed when the remaining six anti-McCarthy holdouts voted &quot;present&quot; on the 15th ballot, ending the longest multiple-ballot speaker election since before the Civil War. He was removed from office less than ten months later, the first time in American History the House voted to remove its incumbent speaker. This led to multiple rounds of voting across multiple weeks to replace him, ultimately leading to the election of Representative Mike Johnson. This came after two weeks of negotiations between Republicans, including three failed votes for Speaker.

===Multi-ballot elections===
In total, there have been 16 elections requiring multiple ballots to elect a speaker, with 13 before the American Civil War, one in 1923, and two in 2023.


== Partisan role ==
The Constitution does not spell out the political role of the speaker. As the office has developed historically, however, it has taken on a clearly partisan cast, very different from the speakership of most Westminster-style legislatures, such as the speaker of the United Kingdom&#x27;s House of Commons, which is meant to be scrupulously non-partisan. The speaker in the United States, by tradition, is the head of the majority party in the House of Representatives, outranking the majority leader. However, despite having the right to vote, the speaker usually does not participate in debate and only votes on the most significant bills.

The speaker is responsible for ensuring that the House passes legislation supported by the majority party. In pursuing this goal, the speaker may use their influence over the Rules committee, which is in charge of the business of the House. The speaker chairs the majority party&#x27;s House steering committee, which selects the majority members of each House standing committee, including the Rules committee (although it&#x27;s worth to note their appointment to the said committees must be ratified by a resolution of the full House). While the speaker is the functioning head of the House majority party, the same is not true of the president pro tempore of the Senate, whose office is primarily ceremonial and honorary.

When the speaker and the president belong to the same party, the speaker tends to play the role in a more ceremonial light, as seen when Dennis Hastert played a very restrained role during the presidency of fellow Republican George W. Bush. Nevertheless, when the speaker and the president belong to the same party, there are also times that the speaker plays a much larger role, and the speaker is tasked, e.g., with pushing through the agenda of the majority party, often at the expense of the minority opposition. This can be seen, most of all, in the speakership of Democratic-Republican Henry Clay, who personally ensured the presidential victory of fellow Democratic-Republican John Quincy Adams. Democrat Sam Rayburn was a key player in the passing of New Deal legislation under the presidency of fellow Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Republican Joseph Gurney Cannon (under Theodore Roosevelt) was particularly infamous for his marginalization of the minority Democrats and centralizing of authority to the speakership. In more recent times, Speaker Nancy Pelosi played a role in continuing the push for health care reform during the presidency of fellow Democrat Barack Obama and in pushing for increases in infrastructure and climate spending during the presidency of Democrat Joe Biden.
On the other hand, when the speaker and the president belong to opposite parties, the public role and influence of the speaker tend to increase. As the highest-ranking member of the opposition party (and &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the opposition), the speaker is normally the chief public opponent of the president&#x27;s agenda. In this scenario, the speaker is known for undercutting the president&#x27;s agenda by blocking measures by the minority party or rejecting bills by the Senate. One famous instance came in the form of Thomas Brackett Reed (under Grover Cleveland), a speaker notorious for his successful attempt to force the Democrats to vote on measures where the Republicans had clear majorities, which ensured that Cleveland&#x27;s Democrats were in no position to challenge the Republicans in the House. Joseph Cannon was particularly unique in that he led the conservative &quot;Old Guard&quot; wing of the Republican Party, while his president—Theodore Roosevelt—was of the more progressive clique, and more than just marginalizing the Democrats, Cannon used his power to punish the dissidents in his party and obstruct the progressive wing of the Republican Party.

More modern examples include Tip O&#x27;Neill, who was a vocal opponent of President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s economic and defense policies; Newt Gingrich, who fought a bitter battle with President Bill Clinton for control of domestic policy; Nancy Pelosi, who argued with President George W. Bush over the Iraq War; John Boehner, who clashed with President Barack Obama over budget issues and health care; and once again, Nancy Pelosi, who refused to support President Donald Trump over funding for a border wall.

== Presiding officer ==

As presiding officer of the House of Representatives, the speaker holds a variety of powers over the House and is ceremonially the highest-ranking legislative official in the U.S. government. The speaker may delegate their powers to a member of the House to act as speaker pro tempore and to preside over the House in the speaker&#x27;s absence; when this has occurred the delegation has always been to a member of the same party. During important debates, the speaker pro tempore is ordinarily a senior member of the majority party who may be chosen for his or her skill in presiding. At other times, more junior members may be assigned to preside to give them experience with the rules and procedures of the House. The speaker may also designate, with approval of the House, a speaker pro tempore for special purposes, such as designating a representative whose district is near Washington, D.C. to sign enrolled bills during long recesses.

Under the rules of the House, the speaker, &quot;as soon as practicable after the election of the speaker and whenever appropriate thereafter&quot;, must deliver to the clerk of the House a list of members who are designated to act as speaker in the case of a vacancy or physical inability of the speaker to perform their duties.

On the floor of the House, the presiding officer is always addressed as &quot;Mister Speaker&quot; or &quot;Madam Speaker&quot;, even if that person is serving as speaker pro tempore. When the House resolves itself into a Committee of the Whole, the speaker designates a member to preside over the committee, who is addressed as &quot;Mister Chairman&quot; or &quot;Madam Chairwoman&quot;. To speak, members must seek the presiding officer&#x27;s recognition. The presiding officer also rules on all points of order but such rulings may be appealed to the whole House. The speaker is responsible for maintaining decorum in the House and may order the Sergeant-at-Arms to enforce House rules.

The speaker is in charge of deciding which committee a bill will be assigned to, of determining whether to allow a member to make a motion to suspend the rules and of appointing members to select committees and conference committees.

As a member of the House, the speaker is entitled to participate in debate and to vote. Ordinarily, the speaker votes only when the speaker&#x27;s vote would be decisive or on matters of great importance, such as constitutional amendments or major legislation. Under the early rules of the House, the speaker was generally barred from voting, but today the speaker has the same right as other members to vote but only occasionally exercises it. The speaker may vote on any matter that comes before the House, and they are required to vote where their vote would be decisive or where the House is engaged in voting by ballot.

== Other functions ==

In addition to being the political and parliamentary leader of the House of Representatives and representing their congressional district, the speaker also performs various other administrative and procedural functions, such as:
* Oversees the officers of the House: the clerk, the sergeant-at-arms, the chief administrative officer, and the chaplain;
* Serves as the chairperson of the House Office Building Commission;
* Appoints the House&#x27;s parliamentarian, historian, general counsel, and inspector general;
* Administers the House audio and video broadcasting system;
*In consultation with the minority leader, can devise a system of drug testing in the House. This option has never been exercised;
* Receives reports or other communications from the president, government agencies, boards, and commissions; and
* Receives, along with the president pro tempore of the Senate, written declarations that a U.S. president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, or is able to resume them, under Sections 3 and 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment.

Additionally, the speaker is second in the presidential line of succession under the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, immediately after the vice president and before the president pro tempore of the Senate (who is followed by members of the president&#x27;s Cabinet). Thus, if both the presidency and vice-presidency were vacant simultaneously, then the speaker would become acting president, after resigning from the House and as speaker.

Ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967, with its mechanism for filling an intra-term vice-presidential vacancy, has made calling on the speaker, president pro tempore, or a cabinet member to serve as acting president unlikely to happen, except in the aftermath of a catastrophic event. However, only a few years after it went into effect, in 1973, at the height of Watergate, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned. With Agnew&#x27;s unexpected departure and the state of Richard Nixon&#x27;s presidency, Speaker Carl Albert was suddenly first in line to become acting president. The vacancy continued until Gerald Ford was sworn in as vice president. Albert was also next in line from the time Ford assumed the presidency following Nixon&#x27;s resignation from office in 1974, until Ford&#x27;s choice to succeed him as vice president, Nelson Rockefeller, was confirmed by Congress.

<text>Abraham Robinson (born Robinsohn; October 6, 1918 – April 11, 1974) was a mathematician who is most widely known for development of nonstandard analysis, a mathematically rigorous system whereby infinitesimal and infinite numbers were reincorporated into modern mathematics. Nearly half of Robinson&#x27;s papers were in applied mathematics rather than in pure mathematics.

==Biography==
He was born to a Jewish family with strong Zionist beliefs, in Waldenburg, Germany, which is now Wałbrzych, in Poland. In 1933, he emigrated to British Mandate of Palestine, where he earned a first degree from the Hebrew University. Robinson was in France when the Nazis invaded during World War II, and escaped by train and on foot, being alternately questioned by French soldiers suspicious of his German passport and asked by them to share his map, which was more detailed than theirs. While in London, he joined the Free French Air Force and contributed to the war effort by teaching himself aerodynamics and becoming an expert on the airfoils used in the wings of fighter planes.

After the war, Robinson worked in London, Toronto, and Jerusalem, but ended up at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1962.

==Work in model theory==
He became known for his approach of using the methods of mathematical logic to attack problems in analysis and abstract algebra. He &quot;introduced many of the fundamental notions of model theory&quot;. Using these methods, he found a way of using formal logic to show that there are self-consistent nonstandard models of the real number system that include infinite and infinitesimal numbers. Others, such as Wilhelmus Luxemburg, showed that the same results could be achieved using ultrafilters, which made Robinson&#x27;s work more accessible to mathematicians who lacked training in formal logic. Robinson&#x27;s book &quot;Non-standard Analysis&quot; was published in 1966. Robinson was strongly interested in the history and philosophy of mathematics, and often remarked that he wanted to get inside the head of Leibniz, the first mathematician to attempt to articulate clearly the concept of infinitesimal numbers.

While at UCLA his colleagues remember him as working hard to accommodate PhD students of all levels of ability by finding them projects of the appropriate difficulty. He was courted by Yale, and after some initial reluctance, he moved there in 1967. In the Spring of 1973 he was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study. He died of pancreatic cancer in 1974.

<doc id="46025" wikidata="Q834848" url="?curid=46025" title="Omnipotence paradox">
<text>The omnipotence paradox is a family of paradoxes that arise with some understandings of the term &quot;omnipotent&quot;. The paradox arises, for example, if one assumes that an omnipotent being has no limits and is capable of realizing any outcome, even a logically contradictory one such as creating a square circle. Atheological arguments based on the omnipotence paradox are sometimes described as evidence for countering theism. Other possible resolutions to the paradox hinge on the definition of omnipotence applied and the nature of God regarding this application and whether omnipotence is directed toward God Himself or outward toward his external surroundings.

The omnipotence paradox has medieval origins, dating at least to the 10th century, when the Saadia Gaon responded to the question of whether God&#x27;s omnipotence extended to logical absurdities. It was later addressed by Averroes and Thomas Aquinas. Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (before 532) has a predecessor version of the paradox, asking whether it is possible for God to &quot;deny Himself&quot;.

The best-known version of the omnipotence paradox is the &quot;paradox of the stone&quot;: &quot;Could God create a stone so heavy that even he could not lift it?&quot; This is a paradoxical question because if God could create something he could not lift, then he would not be omnipotent. Similarly, if God was able to lift the stone then that would mean he was unable to create something he could not lift, leading to the same result. Alternative statements of the paradox include &quot;If given the axioms of Euclidean geometry, can an omnipotent being create a triangle whose angles do not add up to 180 degrees?&quot; and &quot;Can God create a prison so secure that he cannot escape from it?&quot;.

== Overview ==
A common modern version of the omnipotence paradox is expressed in the question: &quot;Can [an omnipotent being] create a stone so heavy that it cannot lift it?&quot; This question generates a dilemma. The being can either create a stone it cannot lift, or it cannot create a stone it cannot lift. If the being create a stone that it cannot lift, then it is not omnipotent because there is a weight threshold beyond its own power to lift. If the being create a stone it cannot lift, then there is something it cannot create, and is therefore not omnipotent. In either case, the being is not omnipotent. This modern version is referred to as the &quot;Paradox of the Stone&quot;.

A related issue is whether the concept of &quot;logically possible&quot; is different for a world in which omnipotence exists than a world in which omnipotence does not exist.

The dilemma of omnipotence is similar to another classic paradox—the irresistible force paradox: &quot;What would happen if an irresistible force were to meet an immovable object?&quot; One response to this paradox is to disallow its formulation, by saying that if a force is irresistible, then by definition there is no immovable object; or conversely, if an immovable object exists, then by definition no force can be irresistible. Another response to this that the only way out of this paradox is if the irresistible force and immovable object never meet. However this does not hold up under scrutiny, because an object cannot in principle be immovable if a force exists that can in principle move it, regardless of whether the force and the object actually meet.

== Types of omnipotence ==
Augustine of Hippo in his City of God writes &quot;God is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills&quot; and thus proposes the definition that &quot;Y is omnipotent&quot; means &quot;If Y wishes to do X then Y can and does do X&quot;. 
The notion of omnipotence can also be applied to an entity in different ways. An essentially omnipotent being is an entity that is necessarily omnipotent. In contrast, an accidentally omnipotent being is an entity that can be omnipotent for a temporary period of time, and then becomes non-omnipotent. The omnipotence paradox can be applied to each type of being differently.

In addition, some philosophers have considered the assumption that a being is either omnipotent or non-omnipotent to be a false dilemma, as it neglects the possibility of varying degrees of omnipotence. Some modern approaches to the problem have involved semantic debates over whether language—and therefore philosophy—can meaningfully address the concept of omnipotence itself.

== Proposed answers ==
=== Omnipotence does not mean breaking the laws of logic ===
A common response from philosophers is that the paradox assumes a wrong definition of omnipotence. Omnipotence, they say, does not mean that God can do anything &quot;at all&quot; but, rather, that he can do anything that is &quot;logically&quot; possible; he cannot, for instance, make a square circle. Likewise, God cannot make a being greater than himself, because he is, by definition, the greatest possible being. God is limited in his actions to his nature. The Bible, in passages such as Hebrews 6:18, says it is &quot;impossible for God to lie&quot;.

A good example of a modern defender of this line of reasoning is George Mavrodes. Essentially, Mavrodes argues that it is no limitation on a being&#x27;s omnipotence to say that it cannot make a round square. Such a &quot;task&quot; is termed by him a &quot;pseudo-task&quot; as it is self-contradictory and inherently nonsense. Harry Frankfurt—following from Descartes—has responded to this solution with a proposal of his own: that God can create a stone impossible to lift and also lift said stone.For why should God not be able to perform the task in question? To be sure, it is a task—the task of lifting a stone which He cannot lift—whose description is self-contradictory. But if God is supposedly capable of performing one task whose description is self-contradictory—that of creating the problematic stone in the first place—why should He not be supposedly capable of performing another—that of lifting the stone? After all, is there any greater trick in performing two logically impossible tasks than there is in performing one?

If a being is &quot;accidentally omnipotent&quot;, it can resolve the paradox by creating a stone it cannot lift, thereby becoming non-omnipotent. Unlike essentially omnipotent entities, it is possible for an accidentally omnipotent being to be non-omnipotent. This raises the question, however, of whether the being was ever truly omnipotent, or just capable of great power. On the other hand, the ability to voluntarily give up great power is often thought of as central to the notion of the Christian Incarnation.

If a being is &quot;essentially omnipotent&quot;, then it can also resolve the paradox. The omnipotent being is essentially omnipotent, and therefore it is impossible for it to be non-omnipotent. Further, the omnipotent being can do what is logically impossible—just like the accidentally omnipotent—and have no limitations except the inability to become non-omnipotent. The omnipotent being cannot create a stone it cannot lift.

The omnipotent being cannot create such a stone because its power is equal to itself—thus, removing the omnipotence, for there can only be one omnipotent being, but it nevertheless retains its omnipotence. This solution works even with definition 2—as long as we also know the being is essentially omnipotent rather than accidentally so. However, it is possible for non-omnipotent beings to compromise their own powers, which presents the paradox that non-omnipotent beings can do something (to themselves) which an essentially omnipotent being cannot do (to itself). This was essentially the position Augustine of Hippo took in his &quot;The City of God&quot;:For He is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills, not on account of His suffering what He wills not; for if that should befall Him, He would by no means be omnipotent. Wherefore, He cannot do some things for the very reason that He is omnipotent.

Thus, Augustine argued that God could not do anything or create any situation that would, in effect, make God not God.

In a 1955 article in the philosophy journal &quot;Mind&quot;, J. L. Mackie tried to resolve the paradox by distinguishing between first-order omnipotence (unlimited power to act) and second-order omnipotence (unlimited power to determine what powers to act things shall have). An omnipotent being with both first and second-order omnipotence at a particular time might restrict its own power to act and, henceforth, cease to be omnipotent in either sense. There has been considerable philosophical dispute since Mackie, as to the best way to formulate the paradox of omnipotence in formal logic.

;God and logic
:Although the most common translation of the noun &quot;Logos&quot; is &quot;Word&quot; other translations have been used. Gordon Clark (1902–1985), a Calvinist theologian and expert on pre-Socratic philosophy, famously translated Logos as &quot;Logic&quot;: &quot;In the beginning was the Logic, and the Logic was with God and the Logic was God&quot;. He meant to imply by this translation that the laws of logic were derived from God and formed part of Creation, and were therefore not a secular principle imposed on the Christian world view.God obeys the laws of logic because God is eternally logical in the same way that God does not perform evil actions because God is eternally good. So, God, by nature logical and unable to violate the laws of logic, cannot make a boulder so heavy he cannot lift it because that would violate the law of non contradiction by creating an immovable object and an unstoppable force.This raises the question, similar to the Euthyphro Dilemma, of where this law of logic, which God is bound to obey, comes from. According to these theologians (Norman Geisler and William Lane Craig), this law is not a law above God that he assents to but, rather, logic is an eternal part of God&#x27;s nature, like his omniscience or omnibenevolence.

=== Paradox is meaningless: the question is sophistry ===
Another common response is that since God is supposedly omnipotent, the phrase &quot;could not lift&quot; does not make sense and the paradox is meaningless. This may mean that the complexity involved in rightly understanding omnipotence—contra all the logical details involved in misunderstanding it—is a function of the fact that omnipotence, like infinity, is perceived at all by contrasting reference to those complex and variable things, &quot;which it is not&quot;. An alternative meaning, however, is that a non-corporeal God cannot lift anything, but can raise it (a linguistic pedantry)—or to use the beliefs of Hindus (that there is one God, who can be manifest as several different beings) that whilst it is possible for God to do all things, it is not possible for all his incarnations to do them. As such, God could create a stone so heavy that, in one incarnation, he could not lift it, yet could do something that an incarnation that &quot;could&quot; lift the stone could not.

The lifting a rock paradox (&quot;Can God lift a stone larger than he can carry?&quot;) uses human characteristics to cover up the main skeletal structure of the question. With these assumptions made, two arguments can stem from it:

#Lifting covers up the definition of translation, which means moving something from one point in space to another. With this in mind, the real question would be, &quot;Can God move a rock from one location in space to another that is larger than possible?&quot; For the rock to be unable to move from one space to another, it would have to be larger than space itself. However, it is impossible for a rock to be larger than space, as space always adjusts itself to cover the space of the rock. If the supposed rock was out of space-time dimension, then the question would not make sense—because it would be impossible to move an object from one location in space to another if there is no space to begin with, meaning the faulting is with the logic of the question and not God&#x27;s capabilities.
#The words, &quot;Lift a Stone&quot; are used instead to substitute capability. With this in mind, essentially the question is asking if God is incapable, so the real question would be, &quot;Is God capable of being incapable?&quot; If God is capable of being incapable, it means that He is incapable, because He has the potential to not be able to do something. Conversely, if God is incapable of being incapable, then the two inabilities cancel each other out, making God have the capability to do something.

The act of killing oneself is not applicable to an omnipotent being, since, despite that such an act does involve some power, it also involves a &quot;lack&quot; of power: the human person who can kill himself is already not indestructible, and, in fact, every agent constituting his environment is more powerful in some ways than himself. In other words, all non-omnipotent agents are concretely &quot;synthetic&quot;: constructed as contingencies of other, smaller, agents, meaning that they, unlike an omnipotent agent, logically can exist not only in multiple instantiation (by being constructed out of the more basic agents they are made of), but are each bound to a different location in space contra transcendent omnipresence.

George I. Mavrodes responded to this paradox by arguing that the question itself is self-contradictory. He wrote:&quot;On the assumption that God is omnipotent, the phrase &quot;a stone too heavy for God to lift&quot; becomes self-contradictory. For it becomes &quot;a stone which cannot be lifted by Him whose power is sufficient for lifting anything.&quot;...

...it is the very omnipotence of God which makes the existence of such a stone absolutely impossible, while it is the fact that I am finite in power that makes it possible for me to make a boat too heavy for me to lift.&quot;Additionally, he also points out how the question is sophistry. Suppose the objector insists that it&#x27;s a coherent question, then we reply by affirming that God can create such a stone. It may seem that this reply will force us into the original dilemma. But it does not. For now the objector can draw no damaging conclusion from this answer. And the reason is that he has just now contended that such a stone is compatible with the omnipotence of God. Therefore, from the possibility of God&#x27;s creating such a stone it cannot be concluded that God is not omnipotent. The objector cannot have it both ways. The conclusion which the objector wishes to draw from an affirmative answer to the original question is itself the required proof that the descriptive phrase which appears there is self-contradictory.

C. S. Lewis argues that when talking about omnipotence, referencing &quot;a rock so heavy that God cannot lift it&quot; is nonsense just as much as referencing &quot;a square circle&quot;; that it is not logically coherent in terms of power to think that omnipotence includes the power to do the logically impossible. So asking &quot;Can God create a rock so heavy that even he cannot lift it?&quot; is just as much nonsense as asking &quot;Can God draw a square circle?&quot; The logical contradiction here being God&#x27;s simultaneous ability and disability in lifting the rock: the statement &quot;God can lift this rock&quot; must have a truth value of either true or false, it cannot possess both. This is justified by observing that for the omnipotent agent to create such a stone, it must already be more powerful than itself: such a stone is too heavy for the omnipotent agent to lift, but the omnipotent agent already can create such a stone; If an omnipotent agent already is more powerful than itself, then it already is just that powerful. This means that its power to create a stone that is too heavy for it to lift is identical to its power to lift that very stone. While this does not quite make complete sense, Lewis wished to stress its implicit point: that even within the attempt to prove that the concept of omnipotence is immediately incoherent, one admits that it is immediately coherent, and that the only difference is that this attempt is forced to admit this despite that the attempt is constituted by a perfectly irrational route to its own unwilling end, with a perfectly irrational set of &#x27;things&#x27; included in that end.

In other words, the &#x27;limit&#x27; on what omnipotence &#x27;can&#x27; do is not a &quot;limit&quot; on its actual agency, but an &quot;epistemological boundary&quot; without which omnipotence could not be &quot;identified&quot; (paradoxically or otherwise) in the first place. In fact, this process is merely a fancier form of the classic Liar Paradox: If I say, &quot;I am a liar&quot;, then how can it be true if I am telling the truth therewith, and, if I am telling the truth therewith, then how can I be a liar? So, to think that omnipotence is an &quot;epistemological&quot; paradox is like failing to recognize that, when taking the statement, &#x27;I am a liar&#x27; self-referentially, the statement is reduced to an actual failure to lie. In other words, if one maintains the supposedly &#x27;initial&#x27; position that the necessary conception of omnipotence includes the &#x27;power&#x27; to compromise both itself and all other identity, and if one concludes from this position that omnipotence is epistemologically incoherent, then one implicitly is asserting that one&#x27;s own &#x27;initial&#x27; position is incoherent. Therefore, the question (and therefore the perceived paradox) is meaningless. Nonsense does not suddenly acquire sense and meaning with the addition of the two words, &quot;God can&quot; before it. Lewis additionally said that, &quot;Unless something is self-evident, nothing can be proved&quot;. This implies for the debate on omnipotence that, &quot;as in matter, so in the human understanding of truth: it takes no true insight to destroy a perfectly integrated structure, and the effort to destroy has greater effect than an equal effort to build; so, a man is thought a fool who assumes its integrity, and thought an abomination who argues for it. It is easier to teach a fish to swim in outer space than to convince a room full of ignorant fools why it cannot be done.&quot;

Paradox assumes the rock has already been created
In 1999, Matthew Whittle asserts that it should not be outside the scope of powers for an omnipotent being to make itself non-omnipotent, so indeed making a rock too heavy to lift is possible for God. The follow on question &quot;Then can he lift it?&quot; assumes that the rock has already been created, so the correct answer would be &quot;Assuming he makes the rock, no&quot;. And if asked &quot;Is God thus not all powerful?&quot;, the correct answer would be &quot;God is indeed all powerful until such time as the rock is created&quot;. The &quot;Paradox&quot; then is not really a paradox.

== Language and omnipotence ==
The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein is frequently interpreted as arguing that language is not up to the task of describing the kind of power an omnipotent being would have. In his &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot;, he stays generally within the realm of logical positivism until claim 6.4—but at 6.41 and following, he argues that ethics and several other issues are &quot;transcendental&quot; subjects that we cannot examine with language. Wittgenstein also mentions the will, life after death, and God—arguing that, &quot;When the answer cannot be put into words, neither can the question be put into words&quot;.

Wittgenstein&#x27;s work expresses the omnipotence paradox as a problem in semantics—the study of how we give symbols meaning. (The retort &quot;That&#x27;s only semantics,&quot; is a way of saying that a statement only concerns the definitions of words, instead of anything important in the physical world.) According to the &quot;Tractatus,&quot; then, even attempting to formulate the omnipotence paradox is futile, since language cannot refer to the entities the paradox considers. The final proposition of the &quot;Tractatus&quot; gives Wittgenstein&#x27;s dictum for these circumstances: &quot;What we cannot speak of, we must pass over in silence&quot;.

Wittgenstein&#x27;s approach to these problems is influential among other 20th century religious thinkers such as D. Z. Phillips. In his later years, however, Wittgenstein wrote works often interpreted as conflicting with his positions in the &quot;Tractatus&quot;, and indeed the later Wittgenstein is mainly seen as the leading critic of the early Wittgenstein.

== Other versions of the paradox ==
In the 6th century, Pseudo-Dionysius claims that a version of the omnipotence paradox constituted the dispute between Paul the Apostle and Elymas the Magician mentioned in Acts 13:8, but it is phrased in terms of a debate as to whether God can &quot;deny himself&quot; a&#x27;la 2 Tim 2:13. In the 11th century, Anselm of Canterbury argues that there are many things that God cannot do, but that nonetheless he counts as omnipotent.

Thomas Aquinas advanced a version of the omnipotence paradox by asking whether God could create a triangle with internal angles that did not add up to 180 degrees. As Aquinas put it in &quot;Summa contra Gentiles&quot;:

Since the principles of certain sciences, such as logic, geometry and arithmetic are taken only from the formal principles of things, on which the essence of the thing depends, it follows that God could not make things contrary to these principles. For example, that a genus was not predicable of the species, or that lines drawn from the centre to the circumference were not equal, or that a triangle did not have three angles equal to two right angles.

This can be done on a sphere, and not on a flat surface. The later invention of non-Euclidean geometry does not resolve this question; for one might as well ask, &quot;If given the axioms of Riemannian geometry, can an omnipotent being create a triangle whose angles &quot;do not&quot; add up to &quot;more&quot; than 180 degrees?&quot; In either case, the real question is whether an omnipotent being would have the ability to evade consequences that follow logically from a system of axioms that the being created.

A version of the paradox can also be seen in non-theological contexts. A similar problem occurs when accessing legislative or parliamentary sovereignty, which holds a specific legal institution to be omnipotent in legal power, and in particular such an institution&#x27;s ability to regulate itself.

In a sense, the classic statement of the omnipotence paradox—a rock so heavy that its omnipotent creator cannot lift it—is grounded in Aristotelian science. After all, if we consider the stone&#x27;s position relative to the sun the planet orbits around, one could hold that the stone is &quot;constantly&quot; lifted—strained though that interpretation would be in the present context. Modern physics indicates that the choice of phrasing about lifting stones should relate to acceleration; however, this does not in itself of course invalidate the fundamental concept of the generalized omnipotence paradox. However, one could easily modify the classic statement as follows: &quot;An omnipotent being creates a universe that follows the laws of Aristotelian physics. Within this universe, can the omnipotent being create a stone so heavy that the being cannot lift it?&quot;

Ethan Allen&#x27;s &quot;Reason&quot; addresses the topics of original sin, theodicy and several others in classic Age of Enlightenment fashion. In Chapter 3, section IV, he notes that &quot;omnipotence itself&quot; could not exempt animal life from mortality, since change and death are defining attributes of such life. He argues, &quot;the one cannot be without the other, any more than there could be a compact number of mountains without valleys, or that I could exist and not exist at the same time, or that God should effect any other contradiction in nature&quot;. Labeled by his friends a Deist, Allen accepted the notion of a divine being, though throughout &quot;Reason&quot; he argues that even a divine being must be circumscribed by logic.

In &quot;Principles of Philosophy,&quot; Descartes tried refuting the existence of atoms with a variation of this argument, claiming God could not create things so indivisible that he could not divide them.

<text>Wallachia or Walachia (; ; Old Romanian: , Romanian Cyrillic alphabet: ) is a historical and geographical region of modern-day Romania. It is situated north of the Lower Danube and south of the Southern Carpathians. Wallachia was traditionally divided into two sections, Muntenia (Greater Wallachia) and Oltenia (Lesser Wallachia). Dobruja could sometimes be considered a third section due to its proximity and brief rule over it. Wallachia as a whole is sometimes referred to as Muntenia through identification with the larger of the two traditional sections.

Wallachia was founded as a principality in the early 14th century by Basarab I after a rebellion against Charles I of Hungary, although the first mention of the territory of Wallachia west of the river Olt dates to a charter given to the voivode Seneslau in 1246 by Béla IV of Hungary. In 1417, Wallachia was forced to accept the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire; this lasted until the 19th century.

In 1859, Wallachia united with Moldavia to form the United Principalities, which adopted the name &quot;Romania&quot; in 1866 and officially became the Kingdom of Romania in 1881. Later, following the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the resolution of the elected representatives of Romanians in 1918, Bukovina, Transylvania and parts of Banat, Crișana, and Maramureș were allocated to the Kingdom of Romania, thereby forming the modern Romanian state.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Wallachia&quot; is an exonym, generally not used by Romanians themselves, who used the denomination &quot;Țara Românească&quot; – Romanian Country or Romanian Land, although it does appear in some Romanian texts as &quot;Valahia&quot; or &quot;Vlahia&quot;. It derives from the term &quot;walhaz&quot; used by Germanic peoples and Early Slavs to refer to Romans and other speakers of foreign languages. In Northwestern Europe, this gave rise to Wales, Cornwall, and Wallonia, among others, while in Southeast Europe it was used to designate Romance-speakers, and subsequently shepherds in general.

In Slavonic texts of the Early Middle Ages, the name &quot;&quot; ( or &quot;Hungaro-Wallachian Land&quot;) was also used as a designation for the region. The term, translated in Romanian as &quot;Ungrovalahia&quot;, remained in use up to the modern era in a religious context, referring to the Romanian Orthodox Metropolitan seat of Hungaro-Wallachia, in contrast to Thessalian or Great Vlachia in Greece or Small Wallachia (Mala Vlaška) in Serbia. The Romanian-language designations of the state were Muntenia (The Land of Mountains), Țara Rumânească (the Romanian Land), Valahia, and, rarely, România. The spelling variant &quot;Țara Românească&quot; was adopted in official documents by the mid-19th century; however, the version with &quot;u&quot; remained common in local dialects until much later.

For long periods after the 14th century, Wallachia was referred to as &#x27; () by Bulgarian sources, &#x27; () by Serbian sources, &#x27; () by Ukrainian sources, and &#x27; or &#x27; by German-speaking (most notably Transylvanian Saxon) sources. The traditional Hungarian name for Wallachia is &#x27;, literally &quot;Snowy lowlands&quot;, the older form of which is &#x27;, meaning &quot;Land beyond the snowy mountains&quot; (&quot;snowy mountains&quot; refers to the Southern Carpathians (the Transylvanian Alps)); its translation into Latin, &#x27; was used in the official royal documents of the Kingdom of Hungary. In Ottoman Turkish, the term &#x27;, or simply &#x27; , appears. In old Albanian, the name was &quot;&quot;, which was used to denote non-Albanian speakers.

Arabic chronicles from the 13th century had used the name of Wallachia instead of Bulgaria. They gave the coordinates of Wallachia and specified that Wallachia was named &#x27; and the dwellers &#x27; or &quot;&quot;.

The area of Oltenia in Wallachia was also known in Turkish as &quot;Kara-Eflak&quot; (&quot;Black Wallachia&quot;) and &quot;Kuçuk-Eflak&quot; (&quot;Little Wallachia&quot;), while the former has also been used for Moldavia.

==History==
===Ancient times===
In the Second Dacian War (AD 105) western Oltenia became part of the Roman province of Dacia, with parts of later Wallachia included in the Moesia Inferior province. The Roman &quot;limes&quot; was initially built along the Olt River in 119 before being moved slightly to the east in the second century, during which time it stretched from the Danube up to Rucăr in the Carpathians. The Roman line fell back to the Olt in 245 and, in 271, the Romans pulled out of the region.

The area was subject to Romanization also during the Migration Period, when most of present-day Romania was also invaded by Goths and Sarmatians known as the Chernyakhov culture, followed by waves of other nomads. In 328, the Romans built a bridge between Sucidava and Oescus (near Gigen) which indicates that there was a significant trade with the peoples north of the Danube. A short period of Roman rule in the area is attested under Emperor Constantine the Great, after he attacked the Goths (who had settled north of the Danube) in 332. The period of Goth rule ended when the Huns arrived in the Pannonian Basin and, under Attila, attacked and destroyed some 170 settlements on both sides of the Danube.

===Early Middle Ages===
Byzantine influence is evident during the fifth to sixth century, such as the site at Ipotești–Cândești culture, but from the second half of the sixth century and in the seventh century, Slavs crossed the territory of Wallachia and settled in it, on their way to Byzantium, occupying the southern bank of the Danube. In 593, the Byzantine commander-in-chief Priscus defeated Slavs, Avars and Gepids on future Wallachian territory, and, in 602, Slavs suffered a crucial defeat in the area; Flavius Mauricius Tiberius, who ordered his army to be deployed north of the Danube, encountered his troops&#x27; strong opposition.

From its establishment in 681 to approximately the Hungarians&#x27; conquest of Transylvania at the end of the tenth century, the First Bulgarian Empire controlled the territory of Wallachia. With the decline and subsequent Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria (from the second half of the tenth century up to 1018), Wallachia came under the control of the Pechenegs, Turkic peoples who extended their rule west through the tenth and 11th century, until they were defeated around 1091, when the Cumans of southern Ruthenia took control of the lands of Wallachia. Beginning with the tenth century, Byzantine, Bulgarian, Hungarian, and later Western sources mention the existence of small polities, possibly peopled by, among others, Vlachs led by &quot;knyazes&quot; and &quot;voivodes&quot;.

In 1241, during the Mongol invasion of Europe, Cuman domination was ended—a direct Mongol rule over Wallachia was not attested. Part of Wallachia was probably briefly disputed by the Kingdom of Hungary and Bulgarians in the following period, but it appears that the severe weakening of Hungarian authority during the Mongol attacks contributed to the establishment of the new and stronger polities attested in Wallachia for the following decades.

===Creation===

One of the first written pieces of evidence of local voivodes is in connection with Litovoi (1272), who ruled over the land on each side of the Carpathians (including Hațeg Country in Transylvania), and refused to pay tribute to Ladislaus IV of Hungary. His successor was his brother Bărbat (1285–1288). The continuing weakening of the Hungarian state by further Mongol invasions (1285–1319) and the fall of the Árpád dynasty opened the way for the unification of Wallachian polities, and independence from Hungarian rule.

Wallachia&#x27;s creation, held by local traditions to have been the work of one &quot;Radu Negru&quot; (Black Radu), is historically connected with Basarab I of Wallachia (1310–1352), who rebelled against Charles I of Hungary and took up rule on either side of the Olt, establishing his residence in Câmpulung as the first ruler of the House of Basarab. Basarab refused to grant Hungary the lands of Făgăraș, Almaș and the Banate of Severin, defeated Charles in the Battle of Posada (1330), and, according to Romanian historian Ștefan Ștefănescu, extended his lands to the east, to comprise lands as far as Kiliya in the Budjak (reportedly providing the origin of &quot;Bessarabia&quot;); the supposed rule over the latter was not preserved by the princes that followed, as Kilia was under the rule of the Nogais c. 1334.

There is evidence that the Second Bulgarian Empire ruled at least nominally the Wallachian lands up to the Rucăr–Bran corridor as late as the late 14th century. In a charter by Radu I, the Wallachian voivode requests that tsar Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria order his customs officers at Rucăr and the Dâmboviţa River bridge to collect tax following the law. The presence of Bulgarian customs officers at the Carpathians indicates a Bulgarian suzerainty over those lands, though Radu&#x27;s imperative tone hints at a strong and increasing Wallachian autonomy. Under Radu I and his successor Dan I, the realms in Transylvania and Severin continued to be disputed with Hungary. Basarab was succeeded by Nicholas Alexander, followed by Vladislav I. Vladislav attacked Transylvania after Louis I occupied lands south of the Danube, conceded to recognize him as overlord in 1368, but rebelled again in the same year; his rule also witnessed the first confrontation between Wallachia and the Ottoman Empire (a battle in which Vladislav was allied with Ivan Shishman).

===1400–1600===
====Mircea the Elder to Radu the Great====
As the entire Balkans became an integral part of the growing Ottoman Empire (a process that concluded with the fall of Constantinople to Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror in 1453), Wallachia became engaged in frequent confrontations in the final years of the reign of Mircea I (r. 1386–1418). Mircea initially defeated the Ottomans in several battles, including the Battle of Rovine in 1394, driving them away from Dobruja and briefly extending his rule to the Danube Delta, Dobruja and Silistra (c. 1400–1404). He swung between alliances with Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, and Jagiellon Poland (taking part in the Battle of Nicopolis), and accepted a peace treaty with the Ottomans in 1417, after Mehmed I took control of Turnu Măgurele and Giurgiu. The two ports remained part of the Ottoman state, with brief interruptions, until 1829. In 1418–1420, Michael I defeated the Ottomans in Severin, only to be killed in battle by the counter-offensive; in 1422, the danger was averted for a short while when Dan II inflicted a defeat on Murad II with the help of Pippo Spano.
The peace signed in 1428 inaugurated a period of internal crisis, as Dan had to defend himself against Radu II, who led the first in a series of boyar coalitions against established princes. Victorious in 1431 (the year when the boyar-backed Alexander I Aldea took the throne), boyars were dealt successive blows by Vlad II Dracul (1436–1442; 1443–1447), who nevertheless attempted to compromise between the Ottoman Sultan and the Holy Roman Empire.
The following decade was marked by the conflict between the rival houses of Dănești and Drăculești. Faced with both internal and external conflict, Vlad II Dracul reluctantly agreed to pay the tribute demanded of him by the Ottoman Empire, despite his affiliation with the Order of the Dragon, a group of independent noblemen whose creed had been to repel the Ottoman invasion. As part of the tribute, the sons of Vlad II Dracul (Radu cel Frumos and Vlad III Dracula) were taken into Ottoman custody. Recognizing the Christian resistance to their invasion, leaders of the Ottoman Empire released Vlad III to rule in 1448 after his father&#x27;s assassination in 1447.
Known as Vlad III the Impaler or Vlad III Dracula, he immediately put to death the boyars who had conspired against his father, and was characterized as both a national hero and a cruel tyrant. He was cheered for restoring order to a destabilized principality, yet showed no mercy toward thieves, murderers or anyone who plotted against his rule. Vlad demonstrated his intolerance for criminals by utilizing impalement as a form of execution. Vlad fiercely resisted Ottoman rule, having both repelled the Ottomans and been pushed back several times.
The Transylvanian Saxons were also furious with him for strengthening the borders of Wallachia, which interfered with their control of trade routes. In retaliation, the Saxons distributed grotesque poems of cruelty and other propaganda, demonizing Vlad III Dracula as a drinker of blood. These tales strongly influenced an eruption of vampiric fiction throughout the West and, in particular, Germany. They also inspired the main character in the 1897 Gothic novel &quot;Dracula&quot; by Bram Stoker.

In 1462, Vlad III was defeated by Mehmed the Conqueror during his offensive at the Night Attack at Târgovişte before being forced to retreat to Târgoviște and accepting to pay an increased tribute. Meanwhile, Vlad III faced parallel conflicts with his brother, Radu cel Frumos, (r. 1437/1439–1475), and Basarab Laiotă cel Bătrân. This led to the conquest of Wallachia by Radu, who would face his own struggles with the resurgent Vlad III and Basarab Laiotă cel Bătrân during his 11-year reign. Subsequently, Radu IV the Great (Radu cel Mare, who ruled 1495–1508) reached several compromises with the boyars, ensuring a period of internal stability that contrasted his clash with Bogdan III the One-Eyed of Moldavia.

====Mihnea cel Rău to Petru Cercel====
The late 15th century saw the ascension of the powerful Craiovești family, virtually independent rulers of the Oltenian banat, who sought Ottoman support in their rivalry with Mihnea cel Rău (1508–1510) and replaced him with Vlăduț. After the latter proved to be hostile to the bans, the House of Basarab formally ended with the rise of Neagoe Basarab, a Craioveşti. Neagoe&#x27;s peaceful rule (1512–1521) was noted for its cultural aspects (the building of the Curtea de Argeş Cathedral and Renaissance influences). It was also a period of increased influence for the Saxon merchants in Brașov and Sibiu, and of Wallachia&#x27;s alliance with Louis II of Hungary. Under Teodosie, the country was again under a four-month-long Ottoman occupation, a military administration that seemed to be an attempt to create a Wallachian &quot;Pashaluk&quot;. This danger rallied all boyars in support of Radu de la Afumaţi (four rules between 1522 and 1529), who lost the battle after an agreement between the Craiovești and Sultan Süleyman the Magnificent; Prince Radu eventually confirmed Süleyman&#x27;s position as suzerain and agreed to pay an even higher tribute.

Ottoman suzerainty remained virtually unchallenged throughout the following 90 years. Radu Paisie, who was deposed by Süleyman in 1545, ceded the port of Brăila to the Ottoman administration in the same year. His successor Mircea Ciobanul (1545–1554; 1558–1559), a prince without any claim to noble heritage, was imposed on the throne and consequently agreed to a decrease in autonomy (increasing taxes and carrying out an armed intervention in Transylvania – supporting the pro-Turkish John Zápolya). Conflicts between boyar families became stringent after the rule of Pătrașcu the Good, and boyar ascendancy over rulers was obvious under Petru the Younger (1559–1568; a reign dominated by Doamna Chiajna and marked by huge increases in taxes), Mihnea Turcitul, and Petru Cercel.

The Ottoman Empire increasingly relied on Wallachia and Moldavia for the supply and maintenance of its military forces; the local army, however, soon disappeared due to the increased costs and the much more obvious efficiency of mercenary troops.

===17th century===

Initially profiting from Ottoman support, Michael the Brave ascended to the throne in 1593, and attacked the troops of Murad III north and south of the Danube in an alliance with Transylvania&#x27;s Sigismund Báthory and Moldavia&#x27;s Aron Vodă (see Battle of Călugăreni). He soon placed himself under the suzerainty of Rudolf II, the Holy Roman Emperor, and, in 1599–1600, intervened in Transylvania against Poland&#x27;s king Sigismund III Vasa, placing the region under his authority; his brief rule also extended to Moldavia later in the following year. For a brief period, Michael the Brave ruled (in a personal, but not formal, union) most of the territories where Romanians lived, rebuilding the base of the ancient Kingdom of Dacia. The rule of Michael the Brave, with its break with Ottoman rule, tense relations with other European powers and the leadership of the three states, was considered in later periods as the precursor of a modern Romania, a thesis which was argued with noted intensity by Nicolae Bălcescu. Following Michael&#x27;s downfall, Wallachia was occupied by the Polish–Moldavian army of Simion Movilă (see Moldavian Magnate Wars), who held the region until 1602, and was subject to Nogai attacks in the same year.

The last stage in the Growth of the Ottoman Empire brought increased pressures on Wallachia: political control was accompanied by Ottoman economical hegemony, the discarding of the capital in Târgoviște in favour of Bucharest (closer to the Ottoman border, and a rapidly growing trade center), the establishment of serfdom under Michael the Brave as a measure to increase manorial revenues, and the decrease in the importance of low-ranking boyars (threatened with extinction, they took part in the &quot;seimeni&quot; rebellion of 1655). Furthermore, the growing importance of appointment to high office in front of land ownership brought about an influx of Greek and Levantine families, a process already resented by locals during the rules of Radu Mihnea in the early 17th century. Matei Basarab, a boyar appointee, brought a long period of relative peace (1632–1654), with the noted exception of the 1653 Battle of Finta, fought between Wallachians and the troops of Moldavian prince Vasile Lupu—ending in disaster for the latter, who was replaced with Prince Matei&#x27;s favourite, Gheorghe Ștefan, on the throne in Iași. A close alliance between Gheorghe Ștefan and Matei&#x27;s successor Constantin Șerban was maintained by Transylvania&#x27;s George II Rákóczi, but their designs for independence from Ottoman rule were crushed by the troops of Mehmed IV in 1658–1659. The reigns of Gheorghe Ghica and Grigore I Ghica, the sultan&#x27;s favourites, signified attempts to prevent such incidents; however, they were also the onset of a violent clash between the Băleanu and Cantacuzino boyar families, which was to mark Wallachia&#x27;s history until the 1680s. The Cantacuzinos, threatened by the alliance between the Băleanus and the Ghicas, backed their own choice of princes (Antonie Vodă din Popești and George Ducas) before promoting themselves—with the ascension of Șerban Cantacuzino (1678–1688).

===Russo-Turkish Wars and the Phanariotes===

Wallachia became a target for Habsburg incursions during the last stages of the Great Turkish War around 1690, when the ruler Constantin Brâncoveanu secretly and unsuccessfully negotiated an anti-Ottoman coalition. Brâncoveanu&#x27;s reign (1688–1714), noted for its late Renaissance cultural achievements (see Brâncovenesc style), also coincided with the rise of Imperial Russia under Tsar Peter the Great—he was approached by the latter during the Russo-Turkish War of 1710–11, and lost his throne and life sometime after sultan Ahmed III caught news of the negotiations. Despite his denunciation of Brâncoveanu&#x27;s policies, Ștefan Cantacuzino attached himself to Habsburg projects and opened the country to the armies of Prince Eugene of Savoy; he was himself deposed and executed in 1716.

Immediately following the deposition of Prince Ștefan, the Ottomans renounced the purely nominal elective system (which had by then already witnessed the decrease in importance of the Boyar Divan over the sultan&#x27;s decision), and princes of the two Danubian Principalities were appointed from the Phanariotes of Constantinople. Inaugurated by Nicholas Mavrocordatos in Moldavia after Dimitrie Cantemir, Phanariote rule was brought to Wallachia in 1715 by the very same ruler. The tense relations between boyars and princes brought a decrease in the number of taxed people (as a privilege gained by the former), a subsequent increase in total taxes, and the enlarged powers of a boyar circle in the Divan.

In parallel, Wallachia became the battleground in a succession of wars between the Ottomans on one side and Russia or the Habsburg monarchy on the other. Mavrocordatos himself was deposed by a boyar rebellion, and arrested by Habsburg troops during the Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18, as the Ottomans had to concede Oltenia to Charles VI of Austria (the Treaty of Passarowitz). The region, organized as the Banat of Craiova and subject to an enlightened absolutist rule that soon disenchanted local boyars, was returned to Wallachia in 1739 (the Treaty of Belgrade, upon the close of the Austro-Russian–Turkish War (1735–39)). Prince Constantine Mavrocordatos, who oversaw the new change in borders, was also responsible for the effective abolition of serfdom in 1746 (which put a stop to the exodus of peasants into Transylvania); during this period, the ban of Oltenia moved his residence from Craiova to Bucharest, signalling, alongside Mavrocordatos&#x27; order to merge his personal treasury with that of the country, a move towards centralism.
In 1768, during the Fifth Russo-Turkish War, Wallachia was placed under its first Russian occupation (helped along by the rebellion of Pârvu Cantacuzino). The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca (1774) allowed Russia to intervene in favour of Eastern Orthodox Ottoman subjects, curtailing Ottoman pressures—including the decrease in sums owed as tribute—and, in time, relatively increasing internal stability while opening Wallachia to more Russian interventions.

Habsburg troops, under Prince Josias of Coburg, again entered the country during the Russo-Turkish-Austrian War, deposing Nicholas Mavrogenes in 1789. A period of crisis followed the Ottoman recovery: Oltenia was devastated by the expeditions of Osman Pazvantoğlu, a powerful rebellious pasha whose raids even caused Prince Constantine Hangerli to lose his life on suspicion of treason (1799), and Alexander Mourousis to renounce his throne (1801). In 1806, the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–12 was partly instigated by the Porte&#x27;s deposition of Constantine Ypsilantis in Bucharest—in tune with the Napoleonic Wars, it was instigated by the French Empire, and also showed the impact of the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca (with its permissive attitude towards Russian political influence in the Danubian Principalities); the war brought the invasion of Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich. After the Peace of Bucharest, the rule of Jean Georges Caradja, although remembered for a major plague epidemic, was notable for its cultural and industrial ventures. During the period, Wallachia increased its strategic importance for most European states interested in supervising Russian expansion; consulates were opened in Bucharest, having an indirect but major impact on Wallachian economy through the protection they extended to &quot;Sudiți&quot; traders (who soon competed successfully against local guilds).

===From Wallachia to Romania===
====Early 19th century====
The death of prince Alexander Soutzos in 1821, coinciding with the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, established a boyar regency which attempted to block the arrival of Scarlat Callimachi to his throne in Bucharest. The parallel uprising in Oltenia, carried out by the Pandur leader Tudor Vladimirescu, although aimed at overthrowing the ascendancy of Greeks, compromised with the Greek revolutionaries in the Filiki Eteria and allied itself with the regents, while seeking Russian support (see also: Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire).

On 21 March 1821 Vladimirescu entered Bucharest. For the following weeks, relations between him and his allies worsened, especially after he sought an agreement with the Ottomans; Eteria&#x27;s leader Alexander Ypsilantis, who had established himself in Moldavia and, after May, in northern Wallachia, viewed the alliance as broken—he had Vladimirescu executed, and faced the Ottoman intervention without Pandur or Russian backing, suffering major defeats in Bucharest and Drăgășani (before retreating to Austrian custody in Transylvania). These violent events, which had seen the majority of Phanariotes siding with Ypsilantis, made Sultan Mahmud II place the Principalities under its occupation (evicted by a request of several European powers), and sanction the end of Phanariote rules: in Wallachia, the first prince to be considered a local one after 1715 was Grigore IV Ghica. Although the new system was confirmed for the rest of Wallachia&#x27;s existence as a state, Ghica&#x27;s rule was abruptly ended by the devastating Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829.

The 1829 Treaty of Adrianople placed Wallachia and Moldavia under Russian military rule, without overturning Ottoman suzerainty, awarding them the first common institutions and semblance of a constitution (see Regulamentul Organic). Wallachia was returned ownership of Brăila, Giurgiu (both of which soon developed into major trading cities on the Danube), and Turnu Măgurele. The treaty also allowed Moldavia and Wallachia to freely trade with countries other than the Ottoman Empire, which signalled substantial economic and urban growth, as well as improving the peasant situation. Many of the provisions had been specified by the 1826 Akkerman Convention between Russia and the Ottomans, but it had never been fully implemented in the three-year interval. The duty of overseeing of the Principalities was left to Russian general Pavel Kiselyov; this period was marked by a series of major changes, including the reestablishment of a Wallachian Army (1831), a tax reform (which nonetheless confirmed tax exemptions for the privileged), as well as major urban works in Bucharest and other cities. In 1834, Wallachia&#x27;s throne was occupied by Alexandru II Ghica—a move in contradiction with the Adrianople treaty, as he had not been elected by the new Legislative Assembly; he was removed by the suzerains in 1842 and replaced with an elected prince, Gheorghe Bibescu.

====1840s–1850s====

Opposition to Ghica&#x27;s arbitrary and highly conservative rule, together with the rise of liberal and radical currents, was first felt with the protests voiced by Ion Câmpineanu (quickly repressed); subsequently, it became increasingly conspiratorial, and centered on those secret societies created by young officers such as Nicolae Bălcescu and Mitică Filipescu.
&quot;Frăția&quot;, a clandestine movement created in 1843, began planning a revolution to overthrow Bibescu and repeal &quot;Regulamentul Organic&quot; in 1848 (inspired by the European rebellions of the same year). Their pan-Wallachian &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; was initially successful only near Turnu Măgurele, where crowds cheered the &quot;Islaz Proclamation&quot; (9 June); among others, the document called for political freedoms, independence, land reform, and the creation of a national guard. On 11–12 June the movement was successful in deposing Bibescu and establishing a Provisional Government, which made &quot;Dreptate, Frăție&quot; (&quot;Justice, Brotherhood&quot;) the national motto. Although sympathetic to the anti-Russian goals of the revolution, the Ottomans were pressured by Russia into repressing it: Ottoman troops entered Bucharest on 13 September. Russian and Turkish troops, present until 1851, brought Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei to the throne, during which interval most participants in the revolution were sent into exile.

Briefly under renewed Russian occupation during the Crimean War, Wallachia and Moldavia were given a new status with a neutral Austrian administration (1854–1856) and the Treaty of Paris: a tutelage shared by Ottomans and a Congress of Great Powers (Britain, France, the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, the Austrian Empire, Prussia, and, albeit never again fully, Russia), with a &quot;kaymakam&quot;-led internal administration. The emerging movement for a union of the Danubian Principalities (a demand first voiced in 1848, and a cause cemented by the return of revolutionary exiles) was advocated by the French and their Sardinian allies, supported by Russia and Prussia, but was rejected or suspicioned by all other overseers.

After an intense campaign, a formal union was ultimately granted: nevertheless, elections for the &quot;Ad hoc Divans&quot; of 1859 profited from a legal ambiguity (the text of the final agreement specified two thrones, but did not prevent any single person from simultaneously taking part in and winning elections in both Bucharest and Iași). Alexander John Cuza, who ran for the unionist &quot;Partida Națională&quot;, won the elections in Moldavia on 5 January; Wallachia, which was expected by the unionists to carry the same vote, returned a majority of anti-unionists to its &quot;divan&quot;.

Those elected changed their allegiance after a mass protest of Bucharest crowds, and Cuza was voted prince of Wallachia on 5 February (24 January Old Style), consequently confirmed as &quot;Domnitor&quot; of the United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia (&quot;of Romania&quot; from 1862) and effectively uniting both principalities. Internationally recognized only for the duration of his reign, the union was irreversible after the ascension of Carol I in 1866 (coinciding with the Austro-Prussian War, it came at a time when Austria, the main opponent of the decision, was not in a position to intervene).

==Society==
===Slavery===
Slavery () was part of the social order from before the founding of the Principality of Wallachia, until it was abolished in stages during the 1840s and 1850s. Most of the slaves were of Roma (Gypsy) ethnicity. The very first document attesting the presence of Roma people in Wallachia dates back to 1385, and refers to the group as &quot;ațigani&quot; (from the Greek&quot; athinganoi&quot;, the origin of the Romanian term &quot;țigani&quot;, which is synonymous with &quot;Gypsy&quot;). Although the Romanian terms &quot;robie&quot; and &quot;sclavie&quot; appear to be synonyms, in terms of legal status, there are significant differences: &quot;sclavie&quot; was the term corresponding to the legal institution during the Roman era, where slaves were considered goods instead of human beings and the owners had &quot;ius vitae necisque&quot; over them (right to end the life of the slave); while &quot;robie&quot; is the feudal institution where the slaves were legally considered human beings and they had reduced legal capacity.

The exact origins of slavery in Wallachia are not known. Slavery was a common practice in Eastern Europe at the time, and there is some debate over whether the Romani people came to Wallachia as free people or as slaves. In the Byzantine Empire, they were slaves of the state and it seems the situation was the same in Bulgaria and Serbia until their social organization was destroyed by the Ottoman conquest, which would suggest that they came as slaves who had a change of &#x27;ownership&#x27;. Historian Nicolae Iorga associated the Roma people&#x27;s arrival with the 1241 Mongol invasion of Europe and considered their slavery as a vestige of that era, the Romanians taking the Roma from the Mongols as slaves and preserving their status. Other historians consider that they were enslaved while captured during the battles with the Tatars. The practice of enslaving prisoners may also have been taken from the Mongols. While it is possible that some Romani people were slaves or auxiliary troops of the Mongols or Tatars, the bulk of them came from south of the Danube at the end of the 14th century, some time after the foundation of Wallachia. The arrival of the Roma made slavery a widespread practice.

Traditionally, Roma slaves were divided into three categories. The smallest was owned by the &quot;hospodars&quot;, and went by the Romanian-language name of &quot;țigani domnești&quot; (&quot;Gypsies belonging to the lord&quot;). The two other categories comprised &quot;țigani mănăstirești&quot; (&quot;Gypsies belonging to the monasteries&quot;), who were the property of Romanian Orthodox and Greek Orthodox monasteries, and &quot;țigani boierești&quot; (&quot;Gypsies belonging to the boyars&quot;), who were enslaved by the category of landowners.

The abolition of slavery was carried out following a campaign by young revolutionaries who embraced the liberal ideas of the Enlightenment. The earliest law which freed a category of slaves was in March 1843, which transferred the control of the state slaves owned by the prison authority to the local authorities, leading to their sedentarizing and becoming peasants. During the Wallachian Revolution of 1848, the agenda of the Provisional Government included the emancipation (&quot;dezrobire&quot;) of the Roma as one of the main social demands. By the 1850s the movement gained support from almost the whole of Romanian society, and the law from February 1856 emancipated all slaves to the status of taxpayers (citizens).

==Geography==
With an area of approximately , Wallachia is situated north of the Danube (and of present-day Bulgaria), east of Serbia and south of the Southern Carpathians, and is traditionally divided between Muntenia in the east (as the political center, Muntenia is often understood as being synonymous with Wallachia), and Oltenia (a former banat) in the west. The division line between the two is the Olt River.

Wallachia&#x27;s traditional border with Moldavia coincided with the Milcov River for most of its length. To the east, over the Danube north-south bend, Wallachia neighbours Dobruja (Northern Dobruja). Over the Carpathians, Wallachia shared a border with Transylvania; Wallachian princes have for long held possession of areas north of the line (Amlaș, Ciceu, Făgăraș, and Hațeg), which are generally not considered part of Wallachia proper.

The capital city changed over time, from Câmpulung to Curtea de Argeș, then to Târgoviște and, after the late 17th century, to Bucharest.

<text>Gerhard Karl Erich Gentzen (24 November 1909 – 4 August 1945) was a German mathematician and logician. He made major contributions to the foundations of mathematics, proof theory, especially on natural deduction and sequent calculus. He died of starvation in a Czech prison camp in Prague in 1945.

==Life and career==
Gentzen was a student of Paul Bernays at the University of Göttingen. Bernays was fired as &quot;non-Aryan&quot; in April 1933 and therefore Hermann Weyl formally acted as his supervisor. Gentzen joined the Sturmabteilung in November 1933, although he was by no means compelled to do so. Nevertheless, he kept in contact with Bernays until the beginning of the Second World War. In 1935, he corresponded with Abraham Fraenkel in Jerusalem and was implicated by the Nazi teachers&#x27; union as one who &quot;keeps contacts to the Chosen People.&quot; In 1935 and 1936, Hermann Weyl, head of the Göttingen mathematics department in 1933 until his resignation under Nazi pressure, made strong efforts to bring him to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.

Between November 1935 and 1939 he was an assistant of David Hilbert in Göttingen. Gentzen joined the Nazi Party in 1937. In April 1939, Gentzen swore the oath of loyalty to Adolf Hitler as part of his academic appointment. From 1943 he was a teacher at the German Charles-Ferdinand University of Prague. Under a contract from the SS, Gentzen worked for the V-2 project.

Gentzen was arrested during the citizens uprising against the occupying German forces on 5 May 1945. He, along with the rest of the staff of the German University in Prague, were detained in a Soviet prison camp, where he died of starvation on 4 August 1945.

==Work==
Gentzen&#x27;s main work was on the foundations of mathematics, in proof theory, specifically natural deduction and the sequent calculus. His cut-elimination theorem is the cornerstone of proof-theoretic semantics, and some philosophical remarks in his &quot;Investigations into Logical Deduction&quot;, together with Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s later work, constitute the starting point for inferential role semantics.

One of Gentzen&#x27;s papers had a second publication in the ideological &quot;Deutsche Mathematik&quot; that was founded by Ludwig Bieberbach who promoted &quot;Aryan&quot; mathematics.

Gentzen proved the consistency of the Peano axioms in a paper published in 1936. In his &quot;Habilitationsschrift&quot;, finished in 1939, he determined the proof-theoretical strength of Peano arithmetic. This was done by a direct proof of the unprovability of the principle of transfinite induction, used in his 1936 proof of consistency, within Peano arithmetic. The principle can, however, be expressed in arithmetic, so that a direct proof of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem followed. Gödel used a coding procedure to construct an unprovable formula of arithmetic. Gentzen&#x27;s proof was published in 1943 and marked the beginning of ordinal proof theory.

<doc id="46029" wikidata="Q799" url="?curid=46029" title="Wisdom">
<text>Wisdom is the ability to apply knowledge, experience, and good judgment to navigate life’s complexities. It is often associated with insight, discernment, and ethics in decision-making. Throughout history, wisdom has been regarded as a key virtue in philosophy, religion, and psychology, representing the ability to understand and respond to reality in a balanced and thoughtful manner. Unlike intelligence, which primarily concerns problem-solving and reasoning, wisdom involves a deeper comprehension of human nature, moral principles, and the long-term consequences of actions.

Philosophically, wisdom has been explored by thinkers from Ancient Greece to modern times. Socrates famously equated wisdom with recognizing one’s own ignorance, while Aristotle saw it as practical reasoning (&quot;phronesis&quot;) and deep contemplation (&quot;sophia&quot;). Eastern traditions, such as Confucianism and Buddhism, emphasize wisdom as a form of enlightened understanding that leads to ethical living and inner peace. Across cultures, wisdom is often linked to virtues like humility, patience, and compassion, suggesting that it is not just about knowing what is right but also acting upon it.

Psychologists study wisdom as a cognitive and emotional trait, often linking it to maturity, emotional regulation, and the ability to consider multiple perspectives. Research suggests that wisdom is associated with qualities such as open-mindedness, empathy, and the ability to manage uncertainty. Some psychological models, such as the Berlin Wisdom Paradigm and Robert Sternberg&#x27;s Balance Theory, attempt to define and measure wisdom through various cognitive and social factors. Neuroscience studies also explore how brain structures related to emotional processing and long-term thinking contribute to wise decision-making.

Wisdom continues to be a subject of interest in modern society, influencing fields as diverse as leadership, education, and personal development. While technology provides greater access to information, it does not necessarily lead to wisdom, which requires careful reflection and ethical consideration. As artificial intelligence and data-driven decision-making play a growing role in shaping human life, discussions on wisdom remain relevant, emphasizing the importance of judgment, ethical responsibility, and long-term planning.

==Etymology and overview==
===Etymology===
The English word wisdom originates from the Old English wīsdōm, which is derived from wīs (&quot;wise&quot;) and dōm (&quot;judgment, decision, law&quot;). The Proto-Germanic root wis- (&quot;to see, to know&quot;) connects wisdom to perception and insight. Related terms appear in Old High German (wīssag, &quot;prophetic&quot;), Old Norse (vísdómr), and Gothic (weisdumbs).

In Ancient Greek, wisdom is expressed as σοφία (&quot;sophia&quot;), often referring to both practical skill and philosophical insight. The term was central to Greek philosophy, particularly in Plato&#x27;s and Aristotle&#x27;s discussions on virtue. The Latin equivalent, &quot;sapientia&quot;, derives from &quot;sapere&quot; (&quot;to taste, to discern&quot;), emphasizing wisdom as discerning between right and wrong.

Similar concepts exist in non-Indo-European languages:

* Sanskrit: &quot;Jñāna&quot; (ज्ञान) and &quot;viveka&quot; (विवेक) refer to intellectual and spiritual wisdom in Hindu thought.
* Chinese: Zhì (智) represents wisdom as practical intelligence, central to Confucian ethics.
* Hebrew: Chokhmah (חָכְמָה) in the Hebrew Bible is linked to divine and moral wisdom.

===Historical overview===

Wisdom has been a central concept in philosophy, religion, and literature across ancient civilizations.

The earliest wisdom literature comes from Sumerian and Egyptian texts. In Sumerian tradition, wisdom (&quot;me&quot;) was considered a divine principle given by the gods, recorded in proverbs and myths. Egyptian wisdom texts, such as the Maxims of Ptahhotep (c. 2400 BCE), emphasized moral conduct and social harmony.

Wisdom became a major theme in Greek philosophy. Socrates equated wisdom with knowing one&#x27;s own ignorance, while Plato argued that wisdom was the highest form of knowledge. Aristotle distinguished between practical wisdom (&quot;phronesis&quot;) and theoretical wisdom (&quot;sophia&quot;), defining wisdom as the ability to deliberate well about the good life.

In Roman philosophy, wisdom (&quot;sapientia&quot;) was regarded as the virtue of the Stoic sage. Cicero and Seneca viewed wisdom as self-discipline and rational living, essential for achieving inner tranquility (&quot;ataraxia&quot;).

Wisdom also developed as a spiritual concept in various traditions:

* Biblical wisdom literature: Books like Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Job depict wisdom as both divine and practical, often contrasting human knowledge with divine omniscience.
* Buddhism: Wisdom (&quot;prajñā&quot;) is one of the threefold trainings leading to enlightenment, developed through meditation and ethical conduct.
* Islamic philosophy: The Arabic term &quot;hikmah&quot; (حكمة) refers to wisdom as both divine insight and rational philosophy, deeply influenced by Aristotle, Avicenna, and Al-Farabi.

==Philosophical perspectives==
Philosophers have explored wisdom as a fundamental concept for millennia, debating its nature, acquisition, and role in ethical and intellectual life. Some traditions emphasize wisdom as practical decision-making, while others frame it as deep contemplation or spiritual insight. Broadly, wisdom has been categorized into theoretical wisdom (&quot;sophia&quot;), practical wisdom (&quot;phronesis&quot;), and moral wisdom, with varying interpretations across different philosophical traditions.

===Western philosophy===
====Ancient Greek philosophy====
Wisdom (&quot;sophia&quot;, σοφία) played a central role in Ancient Greek philosophy and was often distinguished from mere knowledge (&quot;episteme&quot;, ἐπιστήμη).

=====Socrates=====
According to Plato and Xenophon, the Pythia of the Delphic Oracle answered the question &quot;who is the wisest man in Greece?&quot; by stating Socrates was the wisest. According to Plato&#x27;s &quot;Apology&quot;, Socrates (469–399 BCE) decided to investigate the people who might be considered wiser than him, concluding they lacked true knowledge. He argued that true wisdom involves questioning and refining beliefs rather than assuming certainty:

This became immortalized in the phrase &quot;I know that I know nothing&quot;, an aphorism suggesting that it is wise to recognize one&#x27;s own ignorance and to value epistemic humility.

=====Plato and Aristotle=====
To Socrates and his student Plato (c. 427–347 BCE), philosophy was literally the love of wisdom (). This permeates Plato&#x27;s dialogues; in &quot;The Republic&quot; the leaders of his proposed utopia are philosopher kings who, through education and contemplation, attain a deep understanding of justice and the Forms, and possess the courage to act accordingly.

Aristotle (384–322 BCE), in &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, defined wisdom as understanding why things are a certain way (causality), which is deeper than merely knowing things are a certain way. was the first to differentiate between two types of wisdom:

*Theoretical wisdom (), which involves deep contemplation of universal truths.
*Practical wisdom (), which is the ability to make sound decisions in everyday life.

Aristotle saw &quot;phronesis&quot; as essential for ethical living, arguing that virtuous actions require both knowledge and experience. This concept of practical wisdom later influenced virtue ethics and modern discussions of decision-making.

====Medieval and Renaissance thought====
In the Medieval period, wisdom was often linked to divine revelation and theology. Augustine of Hippo (354–430 CE) viewed wisdom as knowledge aligned with God&#x27;s eternal truth, distinguishing it from mere worldly intelligence. He argued that true wisdom (&quot;sapientia&quot;) comes from knowing and loving God, contrasting it with human knowledge (&quot;scientia&quot;), which concerns temporal matters.

Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) built upon Aristotle&#x27;s distinction between theoretical and practical wisdom, incorporating it into Christian theology. He argued that wisdom (&quot;sapientia&quot;) is the highest intellectual virtue, guiding reason toward ultimate truth and divine understanding. Aquinas distinguished between natural wisdom, which humans acquire through reason, and supernatural wisdom, which comes through divine revelation.

During the Renaissance, humanist thinkers such as Erasmus (1466–1536) and Montaigne (1533–1592) emphasized the role of self-reflection and skepticism in wisdom, challenging dogmatic reliance on authority. Montaigne, in his &quot;Essays&quot;, proposed that true wisdom lies in acknowledging uncertainty and maintaining intellectual humility. The Renaissance emphasis on human reason and critical inquiry laid the groundwork for early modern philosophical discussions of wisdom.

====Modern and contemporary philosophy====
In the Age of Enlightenment, the concept of wisdom shifted from religious and metaphysical frameworks to one rooted in rationality and moral duty. Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) argued that wisdom involves the application of practical reason to align one’s actions with universal moral principles. He distinguished between theoretical reason, which seeks knowledge for its own sake, and practical reason, which applies knowledge ethically. Kantian wisdom involves making decisions that conform to the categorical imperative, a moral law derived from reason.

During the 19th century, romanticism and existentialism challenged the rationalist foundations of wisdom. Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) criticized traditional views of wisdom as passive contemplation and obedience to moral codes. Instead, he championed &quot;life-affirming wisdom&quot;, emphasizing personal growth through struggle and self-overcoming. Nietzsche rejected the pursuit of static truths, instead advocating for a dynamic and self-created form of wisdom.

Existentialist philosophers further expanded this critique. Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980) viewed wisdom as a confrontation with the absurd condition of life and the freedom to create meaning in a world devoid of inherent purpose. Albert Camus (1913–1960) echoed these ideas in &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;, arguing that wisdom lies in accepting life&#x27;s absurdity and choosing to live meaningfully despite its challenges.

In the 20th century, pragmatist philosophers like John Dewey (1859–1952) argued for a form of wisdom based on adaptability and practical decision-making. Dewey rejected fixed moral absolutes in favor of wisdom as a constantly evolving process of inquiry and experimentation. Pragmatic wisdom, according to Dewey, emerges from ongoing reflection on experience and the ability to adapt principles to changing contexts.

Meanwhile, virtue ethicists such as Martha Nussbaum argue that wisdom is tied to emotional intelligence and empathy. In her works on Aristotelian ethics, Nussbaum writes that wise individuals understand the complexities of human emotions and integrate them into moral reasoning. This perspective sees wisdom not merely as intellectual discernment but as the capacity to recognize the emotional and contextual dimensions of moral life.

Postmodern philosophers challenge the notion of wisdom as a universal concept. Michel Foucault (1926–1984) argued that ideas of wisdom are shaped by power structures and are inherently subjective, often serving to reinforce dominant ideologies. Postmodern perspectives emphasize cultural relativism and the diversity of wisdom across historical and social contexts rather than a singular definition.

Today, contemporary discussions of wisdom draw from cognitive science and social philosophy. Philosophers like Philip Kitcher focus on practical wisdom as collaborative decision-making in democratic societies. This view holds that wisdom is not an individual trait but a collective process involving diverse perspectives. As such, modern philosophy views wisdom as dynamic, context-dependent, and shaped by emotional, social, and cognitive factors.

===Eastern philosophy===
====In Confucian thought====

In Confucian thought, wisdom (&quot;zhi&quot;, 智) is closely linked to ethical living and social harmony. Confucius (551–479 BCE) taught that wisdom is not merely intelligence but the ability to act virtuously in relationships and governance. It involves self-cultivation, learning from the past, and practicing benevolence (&quot;ren&quot;, 仁), which Confucius regarded as a foundational virtue.

Wisdom in Confucianism is practical and moral, requiring individuals to cultivate righteousness (&quot;yi&quot;, 義) and ritual propriety (&quot;li&quot;, 禮) in order to contribute to a stable society. The ideal wise person, or &quot;superior person&quot; (&quot;junzi&quot;, 君子), embodies wisdom by continuously refining their character and aligning their actions with ethical principles.

Later Confucian thinkers expanded on this concept. Mencius (372–289 BCE) emphasized compassion and moral intuition as sources of wisdom, arguing that humans are naturally inclined toward goodness but must develop wisdom through education and reflection. Xunzi (c. 310–235 BCE), by contrast, saw wisdom as the product of strict discipline and adherence to ritual, believing that human nature is inherently flawed and must be shaped through deliberate effort.

The Confucian approach to wisdom remains influential in East Asian ethics, education, and leadership philosophy, continuing to shape modern discussions on morality and governance.

====In Buddhist philosophy====

In Buddhist philosophy, wisdom (&quot;prajñā&quot;, प्रज्ञा) is one of the threefold training principles (along with ethics and meditation). It involves seeing reality as it truly is, free from delusions. In Mahayana Buddhism, wisdom is often personified by the Bodhisattva Manjushri, who wields a sword to cut through ignorance. Zen traditions emphasize &quot;satori&quot; (悟り), a sudden flash of wisdom or enlightenment. In Theravāda Buddhism, wisdom is developed through vipassanā (insight meditation), leading to the realization of impermanence (&quot;anicca&quot;), suffering (&quot;duḥkha&quot;), and non-self (&quot;anattā&quot;). Buddhist religious traditions provide comprehensive guidance on how to develop wisdom.

The term was translated into Chinese as
 (pinyin , characters 智 &quot;knowledge&quot; and 慧 &quot;bright, intelligent&quot;). In Chinese Buddhism, the idea of wisdom is closely linked to its Indian equivalent as it appears for instance in certain conceptual continuities that exist between Asanga, Vasubandhu and Xuanzang.

Developing wisdom is of central importance in Buddhist traditions, where the ultimate aim is often presented as &quot;seeing things as they are&quot; or as gaining a &quot;penetrative understanding of all phenomena&quot;, which in turn is described as ultimately leading to the &quot;complete freedom from suffering&quot;. In Buddhism, developing wisdom is accomplished through an understanding of what are known as the Four Noble Truths and by following the Noble Eightfold Path. This path lists mindfulness as one of eight required components for cultivating wisdom.

Buddhist scriptures teach that wise people conduct themselves well. A wise person does actions that are unpleasant to do but give good results, and does not do actions that are pleasant to do but give bad results. Wisdom is the antidote to the poison of ignorance. The Buddha has much to say on the subject of wisdom including:

* He who arbitrates a case by force does not thereby become just (established in Dhamma). But the wise man is he who carefully discriminates between right and wrong.
* He who leads others by nonviolence, righteously and equitably, is indeed a guardian of justice, wise and righteous.
* One is not wise merely because he talks much. But he who is calm, free from hatred and fear, is verily called a wise man.
* By quietude alone one does not become a sage () if he is foolish and ignorant. But he who, as if holding a pair of scales, takes the good and shuns the evil, is a wise man; he is indeed a by that very reason. He who understands both good and evil as they really are, is called a true sage.

To recover the original supreme wisdom of self-nature (Buddha-nature or Tathagata) concealed by the self-imposed three dusty poisons (the kleshas: greed, anger, ignorance), Buddha taught to his students the threefold training by turning greed into generosity and discipline, anger into kindness and meditation, ignorance into wisdom.

==== In Hindu philosophy ====
In Hindu philosophy, wisdom (&quot;jñāna&quot;, ज्ञान) is closely associated with self-realization and spiritual knowledge. Unlike the empirical knowledge (&quot;vidyā&quot;, विद्या) gained through sensory experience, wisdom in Hinduism involves insight into the ultimate nature of reality (&quot;Brahman&quot;, ब्रह्मन्) and the self (&quot;Ātman&quot;, आत्मन्). The Upanishads, foundational texts of Hindu thought, describe wisdom as the realization that all worldly distinctions are illusions (&quot;maya&quot;, माया), and that the self is one with the infinite consciousness of Brahman.

Within Vedanta philosophy, wisdom is considered the path to liberation (&quot;mokṣa&quot;, मोक्ष). Adi Shankaracharya (c. 8th century CE) argued that true wisdom (&quot;jnana yoga&quot;) arises through discrimination (&quot;viveka&quot;, विवेक) between the real and the unreal. He taught that ignorance (&quot;avidyā&quot;, अविद्या) binds individuals to the cycle of samsara (rebirth), and wisdom is the means to overcome illusion and attain self-realization. In contrast, Dvaita Vedanta, founded by Madhvacharya (13th century CE), holds that wisdom involves recognizing the eternal distinction between the self and God, rather than dissolving all distinctions.

Wisdom is also a core element in Hindu sacred texts, including the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, where Krishna teaches Arjuna that true wisdom transcends personal desires and emotions. The Gita outlines three paths to wisdom:

* Jnana yoga – the path of intellectual discernment and self-inquiry.
* Bhakti yoga – the path of devotion to a personal deity as a means to wisdom.
* Karma yoga – the path of selfless action leading to enlightened understanding.

Hindu wisdom traditions remain deeply influential in both spiritual practice and philosophical inquiry, with modern thinkers like Swami Vivekananda and Aurobindo Ghose integrating ancient wisdom concepts with contemporary thought. &quot;Medha&quot; is a goddess of wisdom found in the &quot;Garuda Purana&quot;.

====In Taoist philosophy====

Taoist views of wisdom (&quot;wu wei&quot;, 無為) emphasizes effortless action, aligning with the natural flow of the universe (&quot;Tao&quot;). While early Confucianism values social harmony and structured virtue, Taoist wisdom often embraces paradox and non-conformity. The &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; text, attributed to Zhuang Zhou (c. 4th century BCE), presents wisdom as a state of effortless flow (&quot;wu wei&quot;), where one aligns with the spontaneous patterns of nature rather than imposing human will. This contrasts with Confucian ideals of ritual and duty, as Taoist wisdom values freedom from rigid thinking and acceptance of change.

Taoist wisdom also includes cosmological insight, recognizing that all things emerge from the &quot;Tao&quot; (道), the fundamental force of existence. In &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; (道德經), attributed to Laozi (6th century BCE), wisdom is described as yielding like water, able to overcome obstacles through gentleness rather than force. This perspective aligns with Taoist ethics, which discourage aggression and rigid control, instead promoting a harmonious existence in sync with nature’s rhythms. He also describes wisdom as understanding the balance of opposites (Yin and Yang) and acting in harmony with nature rather than imposing force.

Unlike Western views, Taoist wisdom often involves paradox and non-action, valuing spontaneity over rigid rules. Taoist sages are often depicted as detached from worldly concerns, seeking a deeper, wordless understanding of existence that transcends conventional logic.

== Psychological perspectives ==

The three major psychological categories for wisdom are &quot;personality&quot;, &quot;development&quot;, and &quot;expertise&quot;.

Psychologists have begun to gather data on commonly held beliefs or folk theories about wisdom. Initial analyses indicate that although &quot;there is an overlap of the implicit theory of wisdom with intelligence, perceptiveness, spirituality, and shrewdness, it is evident that wisdom is an expertise in dealing with difficult questions of life and adaptation to the complex requirements.&quot;

The field of psychology has also developed explicit theories and empirical research on the psychological processes underlying wisdom. Opinions on the psychological definition of wisdom vary, but there is some consensus that critical to wisdom are certain meta-cognitive processes that afford life reflection and judgment about critical life matters. These processes include recognizing the limits of one&#x27;s own knowledge, acknowledging uncertainty and change, attention to context and the bigger picture, and integrating different perspectives of a situation. Cognitive scientists suggest that wisdom requires coordinating such reasoning processes for insight into managing one&#x27;s life. Reasoning of this sort is both theoretically and empirically distinct from general (fluid or crystallized) intelligence. Researchers have shown empirically that wise reasoning is distinct from IQ.

Baltes and colleagues defined wisdom as &quot;the ability to deal with the contradictions of a specific situation and to assess the consequences of an action for themselves and for others. It is achieved when in a concrete situation, a balance between intrapersonal, interpersonal and institutional interests can be prepared&quot;. Balance appears to be a critical criterion of wisdom. Empirical research provides some support for this idea, showing that wisdom-related reasoning is associated with achieving balance between intrapersonal and interpersonal interests when facing personal life challenges, and when setting goals for managing interpersonal conflicts.

Researchers also explore the role of emotions in wisdom. Most agree that emotions and emotion regulation are key to effectively managing the kinds of complex and arousing situations that most call for wisdom. Much empirical research has focused on the cognitive or meta-cognitive aspects of wisdom, assuming that an ability to reason through difficult situations is paramount. So although emotions likely play a role in how wisdom plays out in real events (and in reflecting on past events), empirical studies were late to develop on how emotions affect a person&#x27;s ability to deal wisely with complex events. One study found a positive relationship between diversity of emotional experience and wise reasoning, irrespective of emotional intensity.

=== Gestalt therapy===
A &quot;wise-person fantasy&quot; is an awareness intervention, where one poses a question, thinks on it for a few minutes, and then role-plays a fantasized wise person to answer that same question.

=== Grossman ===

Grossmann and colleagues summarized prior psychological literature to conclude that wisdom involves certain cognitive processes that afford unbiased, sound judgment in the face of ill-defined life situations:
# intellectual humility, or recognition of limits of own knowledge
# appreciation of perspectives broader than the issue at hand
# sensitivity to the possibility of change in social relations
# compromise or integration of different perspectives
Grossmann found that habitually speaking and thinking of oneself in the third person increases these characteristics, which means that such a habit makes a person wiser. Grossmann says contextual factorssuch as culture, experiences, and social situationsinfluence the understanding, development, and propensity of wisdom, with implications for training and educational practice. These contextual factors are the focus of continuing research. For instance, Grossmann and Kross identified a phenomenon they called &quot;the Solomon&#x27;s paradox&quot;: that people reflect more wisely on other people&#x27;s problems than on their own. (It is named after King Solomon, who had legendary sagacity when making judgments about other people&#x27;s dilemmas but lacked insight when it came to important decisions in his own life.)

=== Measuring wisdom ===

A researcher will measure wisdom differently depending on their theoretical position about the nature of wisdom. For example, some view wisdom as a stable personality trait, others as a context-bound process. Those wedded to the former approach often use single-shot questionnaires, which are prone to responses, something that is antithetical to the wisdom construct and fails to study wisdom in the contexts where it is most relevant: complex life challenges. In contrast, researchers who prefer the latter approach measure wisdom-related features of cognition, motivation, and emotion in the context of a specific situation. Such state-level measures provide less-biased responses as well as greater power in explaining meaningful psychological processes. Also, a focus on the situation allows wisdom researchers to develop a fuller understanding of the role of context in producing wisdom. For example, studies have shown evidence of cross-cultural and within-cultural variability, and systematic variability in reasoning wisely across contexts and in daily life.

Many, but not all, studies find that adults&#x27; self-ratings of perspective and wisdom do not depend on age. This conflicts with the popular notion that wisdom increases with age. The answer to whether age and wisdom correlate depends on how one defines wisdom and one&#x27;s experimental technique. The answer to this question also depends on the domain studied, and the role of experience in that domain, with some contexts favoring older adults, others favoring younger adults, and some not differentiating age groups. Rigorous longitudinal work is needed to answer this question, while most studies rely on cross-sectional observations.

The Jeste-Thomas Wisdom Index is based on a 28-question survey (SD-WISE-28) created by researchers at the University of California San Diego to determine how wise a person is. In 2021 Dr. Dilip V. Jeste and his colleagues created a 7-question survey (SD-WISE-7) testing seven components: acceptance of diverse perspectives, decisiveness, emotional regulation, prosocial behaviors, self-reflection, social advising, and (to a lesser degree) spirituality.

=== Archetypal psychology ===

The wise old person is an unconscious attitude concerning nature and the collective unconscious.

Star Wars is a monomyth that uses archetypal psychology, specifically Joseph Campbell&#x27;s The Hero of a Thousand Faces. The character Master Yoda from the films evokes the trope of the wise old man, and he is frequently quoted, analogously to Chinese thinkers or Eastern sages in general.

== Religious perspectives ==
=== Zoroastrianism ===
In the Avesta Gathas, hymns traditionally attributed to Zoroaster, Ahura Mazda means &quot;Lord&quot; (Ahura) and &quot;Wisdom&quot; (Mazda), and is the central deity who embodies goodness, being also called &quot;Good Thought&quot; (Vohu Manah). In Zoroastrianism, the order of the universe and morals is called (in Avestan, truth, righteousness), which is determined by this omniscient Thought and also considered a deity emanating from Ahura (Amesha Spenta). It is related to another ahura deity, Spenta Mainyu (active Mentality). It says in Yazna 31:
=== Hellenistic religion and Gnosticism ===
In Hellenistic religion, wisdom was often personified as a divine or mystical force guiding human understanding. In Greek mystery religions, particularly Orphism and the Eleusinian Mysteries, wisdom was associated with spiritual enlightenment and initiation into hidden truths. Philosophical movements such as Neoplatonism developed a concept of wisdom (&quot;sophia&quot;, σοφία) as the knowledge of the divine order of existence. Plotinus (204–270 CE) viewed wisdom as an ascent of the soul towards the One, the ultimate source of all reality. In this tradition, wisdom was both intellectual and mystical, requiring inner purification to grasp transcendent truths.

Wisdom also played a central role in Gnosticism, an esoteric movement that emerged in the first few centuries CE. Gnostics saw wisdom (Sophia) as a divine figure, often depicted as a fallen being who sought to restore humanity’s knowledge of its divine origin. In texts in the Nag Hammadi library, Sophia is described as the mother of all living and the source of &quot;gnosis&quot; (spiritual knowledge). According to Valentinian Gnosticism, Sophia’s fall led to the creation of the material world, but through wisdom, the soul could transcend illusion and return to the divine realm.

Gnostic texts such as the &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot; depict wisdom as a cosmic force struggling to free itself from ignorance and darkness. This contrasts with orthodox Christian views, where wisdom (σοφία) is associated with the Logos and divine order rather than cosmic dualism. In Hermeticism, another esoteric tradition of the Hellenistic period, wisdom was linked to inner enlightenment and mystical union with the divine mind (&quot;nous&quot;, νοῦς). These traditions, though diverse, shared the belief that wisdom was the key to transcending material existence and reuniting with the divine.

=== Abrahamic religions ===
==== Hebrew Bible and Judaism ====


The word &quot;wisdom&quot; () is mentioned 222 times in the Hebrew Bible. It was regarded as one of the highest virtues among the Israelites along with kindness () and justice (). The books of Proverbs and Psalms each urge readers to obtain and to increase in wisdom.

In the Hebrew Bible, wisdom is exemplified by Solomon, who asks God for wisdom in . Much of the Book of Proverbs, which is filled with wise sayings, is attributed to Solomon. In , the fear of the Lord is called the beginning of wisdom. Another proverb says that wisdom is gained from God, &quot;For the Lord gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding&quot;. In , there is also reference to wisdom personified in female form, &quot;Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, she raises her voice in the marketplaces.&quot; In , this personified wisdom is described as being present with God before creation began and even as taking part in creation itself.

King Solomon continues his teachings of wisdom in the book of Ecclesiastes. Solomon discusses his exploration of the meaning of life and fulfillment, as he speaks of life&#x27;s pleasures, work, and materialism, yet concludes that it is all meaningless. &quot;&#x27;Meaningless! Meaningless!&quot; says the Teacher [Solomon]. &#x27;Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless&#x27;...For with much wisdom comes much sorrow, the more knowledge, the more grief&quot; Solomon concludes that all life&#x27;s pleasures and riches, and even [human]wisdom, mean nothing if there is no relationship with God.

The Talmud teaches that a wise person can foresee the future. is a Hebrew word for &quot;future,&quot; but also the Hebrew word for &quot;birth&quot;, so one rabbinic interpretation of the teaching is that a wise person is one who can foresee the consequences of his/her choices (i.e. can &quot;see the future&quot; that he/she &quot;gives birth&quot; to).

==== Christian theology ====


In Christian theology, &quot;wisdom&quot; (From Hebrew: transliteration: pronounced: khok-maw&#x27;, Greek: , Latin: ) describes an aspect of God, or the theological concept regarding the wisdom of God.

Christian thought opposes secular wisdom and embraces Godly wisdom. Paul the Apostle states that worldly wisdom thinks the claims of Christ to be foolishness. However, to those who are &quot;on the path to salvation&quot; Christ represents the wisdom of God. Wisdom is considered one of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. gives an alternate list of nine virtues, among which is wisdom.

The Epistle of James is a New Testament analogue of the book of Proverbs, in that it also discusses wisdom. It reiterates the message from Proverbs that wisdom comes from God by stating, &quot;If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you&quot;. James also explains how wisdom helps one acquire other forms of virtue: &quot;But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere.&quot; James focuses on using this God-given wisdom to perform acts of service to the less fortunate.

Apart from Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and James, other main books of wisdom in the Bible are Job, Psalms, and 1 and 2 Corinthians, which give lessons on gaining and using wisdom through difficult situations.

==== Islam ====
The Islamic term for wisdom is . Prophets of Islam are believed by Muslims to possess great wisdom. The term occurs a number of times in the Quran, notably in Sura 2:269, Sura 22:46, and Sura 6:151.

The Sufi philosopher Ibn Arabi considers &quot;al-Hakim&quot; (&quot;The Wise&quot;) as one of the names of the Creator. Wisdom and truth, considered divine attributes, were valued in Islamic sciences and philosophy. The first Arab philosopher, Al-Kindi says at the beginning of his book:

==== Baháʼí Faith ====
In Baháʼí Faith scripture, &quot;The essence of wisdom is the fear of God, the dread of His scourge and punishment, and the apprehension of His justice and decree.&quot; Wisdom is seen as a light that casts away darkness, and &quot;its dictates must be observed under all circumstances&quot;. One may obtain knowledge and wisdom through God, his Word, and his Divine Manifestation; the source of all learning is the knowledge of God.

== Cultural and literary depictions ==

===In mythology===
==== Mesopotamian mythology ====
In Mesopotamian religion and mythology, Enki, also known as Ea, was the god of wisdom and intelligence. Divine wisdom allowed and the ordering of the cosmos, and it was achieved by humans by following s (in Sumerian: order, rite, righteousness) which maintain balance. In addition to hymns to Enki or Ea dating from , there is among the clay tablets of Abu Salabikh from (the oldest dated texts), a &quot;Hymn to Shamash&quot; which includes the following:

==== Egyptian mythology ====

Sia was the personification of perception and thoughtfulness in the mythology of Ancient Egypt. Thoth, married to Maat (in ancient Egyptian: order, righteousness, truth), was regarded as the being who introduced wisdom to the nation.

The concept of Logosmanifest word of the divine thoughtwas also present in the philosophy and hymns of Egypt and Ancient Greece. It was important in the thinking of Heraclitus, and in the Abrahamic traditions. It seems to have been derived from Mesopotamian culture.

==== Greek mythology ====
===== Athena and metis =====


The ancient Greeks considered wisdom to be an important virtue, personified as the goddesses Metis and Athena. Metis was the first wife of Zeus, who, according to Hesiod&#x27;s Theogony, had devoured her pregnant; Zeus earned the title of Mêtieta (&quot;The Wise Counselor&quot;) after that, as Metis was the embodiment of wisdom, and he gave birth to Athena, who is said to have sprung from his head. Athena was portrayed as strong, fair, merciful, and chaste.

===== Apollo =====
Apollo was also considered a god of wisdom, designated as the conductor of the Muses (&quot;Musagetes&quot;), who were personifications of the sciences and of the inspired and poetic arts. According to Plato in his &quot;Cratylus&quot;, the name of Apollo could also mean &quot; (archer) and &quot; (unifier of poles [divine and earthly]), since this god was responsible for divine and true inspirations, thus considered an archer who was always right in healing and oracles: &quot;he is an ever-darting archer&quot;. Apollo prophesied through the priestesses (Pythia) in the Temple of Apollo (Delphi), where the aphorism &quot;know thyself&quot; () was inscribed (one of the Delphic maxims). He was contrasted with Hermes, who was related to the sciences and technical wisdom, and, in the first centuries after Christ, was associated with Thoth in an Egyptian syncretism, under the name Hermes Trimegistus. Greek tradition recorded the earliest introducers of wisdom in the Seven Sages of Greece.

==== Roman mythology ====
The ancient Romans also valued wisdom, which was personified as Minerva or Pallas. She also represents skillful knowledge and the virtues, especially chastity. Her symbol was the owl, which is still a popular representation of wisdom, because it can see in darkness. She was said to have been born from Jupiter&#x27;s forehead.

==== Norse mythology ====

Odin is known for his wisdom, often as acquired through various hardships and ordeals involving pain and self-sacrifice. In one instance he plucked out an eye and offered it to Mímir, guardian of the well of knowledge and wisdom, in return for a drink from the well.
In another famous account, Odin hanged himself for nine nights from Yggdrasil, the World Tree that unites all the realms of existence, suffering from hunger and thirst and finally wounding himself with a spear until he gained the knowledge of runes for use in casting powerful magic. He was also able to acquire the mead of poetry from the giants, a drink of which could grant the power of a scholar or poet, for the benefit of gods and mortals alike.

===In folklore===
==== Wisdom tooth ====
In many cultures, the name for third molars, which are the last teeth to grow, is etymologically linked with wisdom, as in the English &quot;wisdom tooth&quot;. This nickname originated from the classical traditionthe Hippocratic writings used the term (in Greek, related to the meaning of moderation or teaching a lesson), and in Latin (wisdom tooth).

== Educational perspectives ==
Public schools in the U.S. sometimes nod at &quot;character education&quot; which would include training in wisdom.

=== Maxwell&#x27;s educational philosophy ===
Nicholas Maxwell, a philosopher in the United Kingdom, believes academia ought to alter its focus from the acquisition of knowledge to seeking and promoting wisdom. This he defines as the capacity to realize what is of value in life, for oneself and others. He teaches that new knowledge and technological know-how increase our power to act. Without wisdom though, Maxwell claims this new knowledge may cause human harm as well as human good. He argues that the pursuit of knowledge is indeed valuable and good, but that it should be considered a part of the broader task of improving wisdom.

<text>Alfred Bester (December 18, 1913 – September 30, 1987) was an American science fiction author, TV and radio screenwriter, magazine editor and scriptwriter for comics. He is best remembered for his science fiction, including &quot;The Demolished Man&quot;, winner of the inaugural Hugo Award in 1953.

Science fiction author Harry Harrison wrote, &quot;Alfred Bester was one of the handful of writers who invented modern science fiction.&quot;

Shortly before his death, the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA) named Bester its ninth Grand Master, presented posthumously in 1988.
The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted him in 2001.

==Life and career==
Alfred Bester was born in Middletown, New York City, on December 18, 1913. His father, James J. Bester, owned a shoe store and was a first-generation American whose parents were both Austrian Jews. Alfred&#x27;s mother, Belle (née Silverman), was born in Russia and spoke Yiddish as her first language before coming to America as a youth. Alfred was James and Belle&#x27;s second and final child, and only son. (Their first child, Rita, was born in 1908.) Though his mother was born Jewish, she became a Christian Scientist, and Alfred himself was not raised within any religious traditions; he wrote that &quot;his home life was completely liberal and iconoclastic.&quot;

Bester attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a member of the Philomathean Society. He played on the Penn Quakers football team in 1935 and, by his own account, was &quot;the most successful member of the fencing team.&quot; He went on to Columbia Law School, but tired of it and dropped out.

Bester and Rolly Goulko married in 1936. Rolly Bester was a Broadway, radio and television actress, the first to play the role of Lois Lane, which she did on the radio program &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot;. She changed careers in the 1960s, becoming a vice president, casting director and supervisor at the advertising agency Ted Bates &amp; Co. in New York City. The Besters remained married for 48 years until her death. Bester was very nearly a lifelong New Yorker, although he lived in Europe for a little over a year in the mid-1950s and moved to exurban Pennsylvania with Rolly in the early 1980s. Once settled there, they lived on Geigel Hill Road in Ottsville, Pennsylvania.

===Writing career===
====Early SF career, comic books, radio (1939–1950)====
After his university career, 25-year-old Alfred Bester was working in public relations when he turned to writing science fiction. Bester&#x27;s first published short story was &quot;The Broken Axiom&quot;, which appeared in the April 1939 issue of &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot; after winning an amateur story competition. Bester recalled, &quot;Two editors on the staff, Mort Weisinger and Jack Schiff, took an interest in me, I suspect mostly because I&#x27;d just finished reading and annotating Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; and would preach it enthusiastically without provocation, to their great amusement. ... They thought &quot;Diaz-X&quot; [Bester&#x27;s original title] might fill the bill if it was whipped into shape.&quot; This was the very same contest that Robert A. Heinlein famously chose not to enter, as the prize was only $50 and Heinlein realized he could do better selling &quot;his&quot; 7,000-word unpublished story to &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; for a penny a word, or $70. Years later, Bester interviewed Heinlein for &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; and the latter told of changing his mind for &quot;Astounding&quot;. Bester says that he replied (in jest), &quot;You sonofabitch. I won that &quot;Thrilling Wonder&quot; contest, and you beat me by twenty dollars.&quot;

However, as Bester was the winner of the contest, Mort Weisinger also &quot;introduced me to the informal luncheon gatherings of the working science fiction authors of the late thirties.&quot; He met Henry Kuttner, Edmond Hamilton, Otto Binder, Malcolm Jameson and Manly Wade Wellman there. During 1939 and 1940 Weisinger published three more of Bester&#x27;s stories in &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot; and &quot;Startling Stories&quot;. For the next few years, Bester continued to publish short fiction, most notably in John W. Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;.

In 1942, two of his science fiction editors got work at DC Comics, and invited Bester to contribute to various DC titles. Consequently, Bester left the field of short story writing and began working for DC Comics as a writer, including, and, under the editorship of Julius Schwartz, &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, among other titles. He created super-villain Solomon Grundy and the version of the Green Lantern Oath that begins &quot;In brightest day, In blackest night&quot;. Bester was also the writer for Lee Falk&#x27;s comic strips &quot;The Phantom&quot; and &quot;Mandrake the Magician&quot; while their creator served in World War II. It is widely speculated how much influence Bester had on these comics. One theory claims that Bester was responsible for giving the Phantom his surname, &quot;Walker&quot;.

After four years in the comics industry, in 1946 Bester turned his attention to radio scripts, after wife Rolly (a busy radio actress) told him that the show &quot;Nick Carter, Master Detective&quot; was looking for story submissions. Over the next few years, Bester wrote for &quot;Nick Carter&quot;, as well as &quot;The Shadow&quot;, &quot;Charlie Chan&quot;, &quot;The New Adventures of Nero Wolfe&quot; and other shows. He later wrote for &quot;The CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot;.

With the advent of American network television in 1948, Bester also began writing for television, although most of these projects were lesser-known.

In early 1950, after eight years away from the field, Bester resumed writing science fiction short stories. However, after an initial return to &quot;Astounding&quot; with the story &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Invention&quot; ( &quot;Oddy and Id&quot;), he stopped writing for the magazine in mid-1950 when editor John Campbell became preoccupied with L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetics, the forerunner to Scientology. Bester then turned to &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;, where he found in H. L. Gold another exceptional editor as well as a good friend.

In New York, he socialized at the Hydra Club, an organization of New York&#x27;s science fiction writers, whose notable members included Isaac Asimov, James Blish, Anthony Boucher, Avram Davidson, Judith Merril, and Theodore Sturgeon.

====&quot;The Demolished Man&quot; period: 1951–1957====
In his first period of writing science fiction (1939–1942), Bester had been establishing a reputation as a short story writer in science fiction circles with stories such as &quot;Adam and No Eve.&quot; However, Bester gained his greatest renown for the work he wrote and published in the 1950s, including &quot;The Demolished Man&quot; and &quot;The Stars My Destination&quot; (also known as &quot;Tiger! Tiger!&quot;).

=====&quot;The Demolished Man&quot; (1953)=====

&quot;The Demolished Man&quot;, recipient of the first Hugo Award for best Science Fiction novel, is a police procedural that takes place in a future world in which telepathy is relatively common. Bester creates a harshly capitalistic, hierarchical and competitive social world that exists without deceit: a society in which the right person with some skill (or money) and curiosity can access your memories, secrets, fears and past misdeeds more swiftly than even you.

Originally published in three parts in &quot;Galaxy&quot;, beginning in January 1952, &quot;The Demolished Man&quot; appeared in book form in 1953. It was dedicated to Gold, who made a number of suggestions during its writing. Originally, Bester wanted the title to be &quot;Demolition!&quot;, but Gold talked him out of it.

=====&quot;Who He?&quot; (1953)=====
Bester&#x27;s 1953 novel &quot;Who He?&quot; (also known as &quot;The Rat Race&quot;) concerns a TV variety show writer who wakes up after an alcoholic blackout and discovers that someone is out to destroy his life. According to Bester, the TV show elements were based on his experiences working on &quot;The Paul Winchell Show&quot;. A contemporary novel with no science fiction elements, it did not receive wide attention. It did, however, earn Bester a fair amount of money from the sale of the paperback reprint rights (the book appeared in paperback as &quot;The Rat Race&quot;). He also received a substantial sum of money from a movie studio for the film option to the book. Reportedly, Jackie Gleason was interested in starring as the variety show writer and licensed movie rights to the story; however no movie was ever made of &quot;Who He?&quot; Still, the payout from the film option was large enough that Alfred and Rolly Bester decided they could afford to travel to Europe for the next few years. They lived mainly in Italy and England during this period.

=====&quot;The Stars My Destination&quot; (1956)=====

This novel was both widely criticized and praised when it first appeared, but over time gathered acclaim as a classic work in its own right. It has been recognized as a prescient forerunner of the cyberpunk literary genre, having first been published two decades before the genre was named.

====Magazine fiction and non-fiction: 1959–1962====
While on his European trip, Bester began selling non-fiction pieces about various European locations to the mainstream travel/lifestyle magazine &quot;Holiday&quot;. The &quot;Holiday&quot; editors, impressed with his work, invited Bester back to their headquarters in New York and began commissioning him to write travel articles about various far-flung locales, as well as doing interviews with such stars as Sophia Loren, Anthony Quinn, and Sir Edmund Hillary. As a result of steady work with &quot;Holiday&quot;, Bester&#x27;s science fiction output dropped precipitously in the years following the publication of &quot;The Stars My Destination&quot;.

Bester published three short stories each in 1958 and 1959, including 1958&#x27;s &quot;The Men Who Murdered Mohammed&quot; and 1959&#x27;s &quot;The Pi Man&quot;, both of which were nominated for Hugo Awards. However, for a four-year period from October 1959 to October 1963, he published no fiction at all. Instead, he concentrated on his work at &quot;Holiday&quot; (where he was made a senior editor), reviewed books for &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; (from 1960 to 1962) and returned to television scripting.

====Television: 1959–1962====
During the 1950s, Bester contributed a satiric sketch, &quot;I Remember Hiroshima&quot;, to &quot;The Paul Winchell Show&quot;. His later story &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot; was based on it.

In 1959, Bester adapted his 1954 story &quot;Fondly Fahrenheit&quot; to television as &quot;Murder and the Android&quot;. Telecast in color on October 18, 1959, the hour-long drama took place in the year 2359 amid futuristic sets designed by Ted Cooper. This &quot;NBC Sunday Showcase&quot; production, produced by Robert Alan Aurthur with a cast of Kevin McCarthy, Rip Torn, Suzanne Pleshette and Telly Savalas, was reviewed by syndicated radio-television critic John Crosby:

&quot;Murder and the Android&quot; was nominated for a 1960 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and was given a repeat on September 5, 1960, the Labor Day weekend in which that Hugo Award was presented (to &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;) at the World Science Fiction Convention in Pittsburgh. Bester returned to &quot;Sunday Showcase&quot; March 5, 1960, with an original teleplay, &quot;Turn the Key Deftly&quot;. Telecast in color, that mystery, set in a traveling circus, starred Julie Harris, Maximilian Schell and Francis Lederer.

For &quot;Alcoa Premiere&quot;, hosted by Fred Astaire, he wrote &quot;Mr. Lucifer&quot;, which aired November 1, 1962, with Astaire in the title role opposite Elizabeth Montgomery. A light comedy, the story concerned the modern day Lucifer—whose offices are now on Madison Avenue—working with his beautiful secretary to try to corrupt a clean-cut American husband and wife.

====Senior editor of &quot;Holiday&quot;: 1963–1971====
After a four-year layoff, Bester published a handful of science fiction short stories in 1963 and 1964. However, writing science fiction was at this stage in Bester&#x27;s life clearly more of a sideline than the focus of his career. As a result, from 1964 until the original version of &quot;Holiday&quot; folded in 1971, Bester published only one science fiction short story, a 700-word science fiction spoof in the upscale mainstream magazine &quot;Status&quot;.
Still, as senior editor of &quot;Holiday&quot;, Bester was able to introduce occasional science fiction elements into the non-fiction magazine. On one occasion, he commissioned and published an article by Arthur C. Clarke describing a tourist flight to the Moon. Bester himself, though, never published any science fiction in &quot;Holiday&quot;, which was a mainstream travel/lifestyle magazine marketed to upscale readers during an era when science fiction was largely dismissed as juvenilia.

====Later career: 1972–1987====
&quot;Holiday&quot; magazine ceased publication in 1971, although it was later revived and reformatted by other hands, without Bester&#x27;s involvement. For the first time in nearly 15 years, Bester did not have full-time employment.

After a long layoff from writing science fiction, Bester returned to the field in 1972. His 1974 short story &quot;The Four-Hour Fugue&quot; was nominated for a Hugo Award, and Bester received Hugo and Nebula Award nominations for his 1975 novel &quot;The Computer Connection&quot; (titled &quot;The Indian Giver&quot; as a magazine serial and later reprinted as &quot;Extro&quot;). Despite these nominations, Bester&#x27;s work of this era generally failed to receive the critical or commercial success of his earlier period.

Bester&#x27;s eyesight began failing in the mid-1970s, making writing increasingly difficult, and another layoff from published writing took place between early 1975 and early 1979. It is alleged during this period that the producer of the 1978 &quot;Superman&quot; movie sent his son off to search for a writer. The name Alfred Bester came up, but Bester wanted to focus the story on Clark Kent as the real hero, while Superman was only &quot;his gun.&quot; The producers instead hired Mario Puzo, author of &quot;The Godfather&quot;, to write the film.

Carolyn Wendell wrote, &quot;I shall always remember the time I saw Alfie Bester in larger-than-life action, at an academic conference in New York City ten years before he died&quot;:

Bester published two short stories in 1979 and rang in the 1980s with the publication of two new novels: &quot;Golem100&quot; (1980), and &quot;The Deceivers&quot; (1981). In addition to his failing eyesight, other health issues began to affect him, and Bester produced no new published work after 1981. His wife Rolly died in 1984. In the following years, Bester dated Judith H. McQuown (pronounced &quot;McQueen&quot;).

In 1985, it was announced that Bester would be a Guest of Honor at the 1987 Worldcon, to be held in Brighton, England. As the event neared, however, Bester fell and broke his hip. With his worsening overall health, he was plainly too ill to attend.

Bester died less than a month after the convention from complications related to his broken hip. However, shortly before his death he learned that the Science Fiction Writers of America would honor him with their Grand Master Nebula award at their 1988 convention.

Two works by Bester were published posthumously. The first, &quot;Tender Loving Rage&quot; (1991), was a mainstream (i.e., non–science fiction) novel that was probably written in the late 1950s or early 1960s. The second, &quot;Psychoshop&quot; (1998), was based on an incomplete 92-page story fragment. It was completed by Roger Zelazny and remained unpublished until three years after Zelazny&#x27;s death. When published, it was credited as a collaborative work.

Upon his death, Bester left his literary estate to his friend and bartender Joe Suder.

<text>Porpoises () are small dolphin-like cetaceans classified under the family Phocoenidae. Although similar in appearance to dolphins, they are more closely related to narwhals and belugas than to the true dolphins. There are eight extant species of porpoise, all among the smallest of the toothed whales. Porpoises are distinguished from dolphins by their flattened, spade-shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins, and lack of a pronounced beak, although some dolphins (e.g. Hector&#x27;s dolphin) also lack a pronounced beak. Porpoises, and other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates.

Porpoises range in size from the vaquita, at in length and in weight, to the Dall&#x27;s porpoise, at and . Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism in that the females are larger than males. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Porpoises use echolocation as their primary sensory system. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. As all cetaceans, they have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep them warm in cold water.

Porpoises are abundant and found in a multitude of environments, including rivers (finless porpoise), coastal and shelf waters (harbour porpoise, vaquita) and open ocean (Dall&#x27;s porpoise and spectacled porpoise), covering all water temperatures from tropical (Sea of Cortez, vaquita) to polar (Greenland, harbour porpoise). Porpoises feed largely on fish and squid, much like the rest of the odontocetes. Little is known about reproductive behaviour. Females may have one calf every year under favourable conditions. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and remain dependent on the female until the following spring. Porpoises produce ultrasonic clicks, which are used for both navigation (echolocation) and social communication. In contrast to many dolphin species, porpoises do not form large social groups.

Porpoises were, and still are, hunted by some countries by means of drive hunting. Larger threats to porpoises include extensive bycatch in gill nets, competition for food from fisheries, and marine pollution, in particular heavy metals and organochlorides. The vaquita is nearly extinct due to bycatch in gill nets, with a predicted population of fewer than a dozen individuals. Since the extinction of the baiji, the vaquita is considered the most endangered cetacean. Some species of porpoises have been and are kept in captivity and trained for research, education and public display.

==Taxonomy and evolution==

Porpoises, along with whales and dolphins, are descendants of land-living ungulates (hoofed animals) that first entered the oceans around 50 million years ago (Mya). During the Miocene (23 to 5 Mya), mammals were fairly modern, meaning they seldom changed physiologically from the time. The cetaceans diversified, and fossil evidence suggests porpoises and dolphins diverged from their last common ancestor around 15 Mya. The oldest fossils are known from the shallow seas around the North Pacific, with animals spreading to the European coasts and Southern Hemisphere only much later, during the Pliocene.

==Biology==

===Anatomy===

Porpoises have a bulbous head, no external ear flaps, a non-flexible neck, a torpedo shaped body, limbs modified into flippers, and a tail fin. Their skull has small eye orbits, small, blunt snouts, and eyes placed on the sides of the head. Porpoises range in size from the and vaquita to the and Dall&#x27;s porpoise. Overall, they tend to be dwarfed by other cetaceans. Almost all species have female-biased sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males, although those physical differences are generally small; one exception is Dall&#x27;s porpoise.

Odontocetes possess teeth with cementum cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on the portion of the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Porpoises have a three-chambered stomach, including a fore-stomach and fundic and pyloric chambers. Porpoises, like other odontocetes, possess only one blowhole. Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. All porpoises have a thick layer of blubber. This blubber can help with insulation from the harsh underwater climate, protection to some extent as predators would have a hard time getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but rapidly gain a thick layer from the milk, which has a very high fat content.

===Locomotion===
Porpoises have two flippers on the front and a tail fin. Their flippers contain four digits. Although porpoises do not possess fully developed hind limbs, they possess discrete rudimentary appendages, which may contain feet and digits. Porpoises are fast swimmers in comparison to seals, which typically cruise at . The fusing of the neck vertebrae, while increasing stability when swimming at high speeds, decreases flexibility, making it impossible for them to turn their head. When swimming, they move their tail fin and lower body up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Flipper movement is continuous. Some species log out of the water, which may allow them to travel faster, and sometimes they porpoise out of the water, meaning jump out of the water. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. They have a very well defined and triangular dorsal fin, allowing them to steer better in the water. Unlike their dolphin counterparts, they are adapted for coastal shores, bays, and estuaries.

===Senses===
The porpoise ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equaliser between the outside air&#x27;s low impedance and the cochlear fluid&#x27;s high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, porpoises receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The porpoise ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The large bulge on top of the porpoises head is caused by the melon.

The porpoise eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the eyes of a porpoise are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When porpoises surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; their eyes contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Porpoises do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most porpoises have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, they are able to form a very clear image of the surrounding area.

The olfactory lobes are absent in porpoises, suggesting that they have no sense of smell.

Porpoises are not thought to have a good sense of taste, as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether. However, some have preferences between different kinds of fish, indicating some sort of attachment to taste.

===Sleep===
Unlike most animals, porpoises are conscious breathers. All mammals sleep, but porpoises cannot afford to become unconscious for long because they may drown. While knowledge of sleep in wild cetaceans is limited, porpoises in captivity have been recorded to sleep with one side of their brain at a time, so that they may swim, breathe consciously, and avoid both predators and social contact during their period of rest.

==Behaviour==
===Life cycle===
Porpoises are fully aquatic creatures. Females deliver a single calf after a gestation period lasting about a year. Calving takes place entirely under water, with the foetus positioned for tail-first delivery to help prevent drowning. Females have mammary glands, but the shape of a newborn calf&#x27;s mouth does not allow it to obtain a seal around the nipple—instead of the calf sucking milk, the mother squirts milk into the calf&#x27;s mouth. This milk contains high amounts of fat, which aids in the development of blubber; it contains so much fat that it has the consistency of toothpaste. The calves are weaned at about 11 months of age. Males play no part in rearing calves. The calf is dependent for one to two years, and maturity occurs after seven to ten years, all varying between species. This mode of reproduction produces few offspring, but increases the probability of each one surviving.

===Diet===
Porpoises eat a wide variety of creatures. The stomach contents of harbour porpoises suggests that they mainly feed on benthic fish, and sometimes pelagic fish. They may also eat benthic invertebrates. In rare cases, algae, such as &quot;Ulva lactuca&quot;, is consumed. Atlantic porpoises are thought to follow the seasonal migration of bait fish, like herring, and their diet varies between seasons. The stomach contents of Dall&#x27;s porpoises reveal that they mainly feed on cephalopods and bait fish, like capelin and sardines. Their stomachs also contained some deep-sea benthic organisms.

The finless porpoise is known to also follow seasonal migrations. It is known that populations in the mouth of the Indus River migrate to the sea from April through October to feed on the annual spawning of prawns. In Japan, sightings of small pods of them herding sand lance onto shore are common year-round.

Little is known about the diets of other species of porpoises. A dissection of three Burmeister&#x27;s porpoises shows that they consume shrimp and euphausiids (krill). A dissection of a beached Vaquita showed remains of squid and grunts. Nothing is known about the diet of the spectacled porpoise.

==Interactions with humans==

===Research history===

In Aristotle&#x27;s time, the 4th century BCE, porpoises were regarded as fish due to their superficial similarity. Aristotle, however, could already see many physiological and anatomical similarities with the terrestrial vertebrates, such as blood (circulation), lungs, uterus and fin anatomy. His detailed descriptions were assimilated by the Romans, but mixed with a more accurate knowledge of the dolphins, as mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his &quot;Natural history&quot;. In the art of this and subsequent periods, porpoises are portrayed with a long snout (typical of dolphins) and a high-arched head. The harbour porpoise was one of the most accessible species for early cetologists, because it could be seen very close to land, inhabiting shallow coastal areas of Europe. Much of the findings that apply to all cetaceans were first discovered in porpoises. One of the first anatomical descriptions of the airways of the whales on the basis of a harbor porpoise dates from 1671 by John Ray. It nevertheless referred to the porpoise as a fish, most likely not in the modern-day sense, where it refers to a zoological group, but the older reference as simply a creature of the sea (cf. for example &quot;star-fish&quot;, &quot;cuttle-fish&quot;, &quot;jelly-fish&quot; and &quot;whale-fish&quot;).

===In captivity===

Harbour porpoises have historically been kept in captivity, under the assumption that they would fare better than their dolphin counterparts due to their smaller size and shallow-water habitats. Up until the 1980s, they were consistently short-lived. Harbour porpoises have a very long captive history, with poorly documented attempts as early as the 15th century, and better documented starting in the 1860s and 1870s in London Zoo, the now-closed Brighton Aquarium &amp; Dolphinarium, and a zoo in Germany. At least 150 harbour porpoises have been kept worldwide, but only about 20 were actively caught for captivity. The captive history is best documented from Denmark where about 100 harbour porpoises have been kept, most in the 1960s and 1970s. All but two were incidental catches in fishing nets or strandings. Nearly half of these died within a month of diseases caught before they were captured or from damage sustained during capture. Up until 1984, none lived for more than 14 months. Attempts to rehabilitate seven rescued individuals in 1986 only resulted in three that could be released 6 months later. Very few have been brought into captivity later, but they have lived considerably longer. In recent decades, the only place keeping the species in Denmark is the Fjord &amp; Bælt Centre, where three rescues have been kept, along with their offspring. Among the three rescues, one (father of world&#x27;s first harbour porpoise born in captivity) lived for 20 years in captivity, another for 15 years, while the third (mother of first born in captivity) is the world&#x27;s oldest known harbour porpoise, being 28 years old in 2023. The typical age reached in the wild is 14 years or less. Very few harbour porpoises have been born in captivity. Historically, harbour porpoises were often kept singly and those who were together often were not mature or of the same sex. Disregarding one born more than 100 years ago that was the result of a pregnant female being brought into captivity, the world&#x27;s first full captive breeding was in 2007 in the Fjord &amp; Bælt Centre, followed by another in 2009 in the Dolfinarium Harderwijk, the Netherlands. In addition to the few kept in Europe, harbour porpoise were displayed at the Vancouver Aquarium (Canada) until recently. This was a female that had beached herself onto Horseshoe Bay in 2008 and a male that had done the same in 2011. They died in 2017 and 2016 respectively.

Finless porpoises have commonly been kept in Japan, as well as China and Indonesia. As of 1984, ninety-four in total had been in captivity in Japan, eleven in China, and at least two in Indonesia. As of 1986, three establishments in Japan had bred them, and there had been five recorded births. Three calves died moments after their birth, but two survived for several years. This breeding success, combined with the results with harbour porpoise in Denmark and the Netherlands, proved that porpoises can be successfully bred in captivity, and this could open up new conservation options. The reopened Miyajima Public Aquarium (Japan) houses three finless porpoises. As part of an attempt of saving the narrow-ridged (or Yangtze) finless porpoise, several are kept in the Baiji Dolphinarium in China. After having been kept in captivity for 9 years, the first breeding happened in 2005.

Small numbers of Dall&#x27;s porpoises have been kept in captivity in both the United States and Japan, with the most recent being in the 1980s. The first recorded instance of a Dall&#x27;s taken for an aquarium was in 1956 captured off Catalina Island in southern California. Dall&#x27;s porpoises consistently failed to thrive in captivity. These animals often repeatedly ran into the walls of their enclosures, refused food, and exhibited skin sloughing. Almost all Dall&#x27;s porpoises introduced to aquaria died shortly after, typically within days. Only two have lived for more than 60 days: a male reached 15 months at Marineland of the Pacific and another 21 months at a United States Navy facility.

As part of last-ditch effort of saving the extremely rare vaquita (the tiny remaining population is rapidly declining because of bycatch in gillnets), there have been attempts of transferring some to captivity. The first and only caught for captivity were two females in 2017. Both became distressed and were rapidly released, but one of them died in the process. Soon after the project was abandoned.

Only a single Burmeister&#x27;s porpoise and a single spectacled porpoise have been kept in captivity. Both were stranded individuals that only survived a few days after their rescue.

===Threats===

====Hunting====

Porpoises and other smaller cetaceans have traditionally been hunted in many areas, at least in Asia, Europe and North America, for their meat and blubber. A dominant hunting technique is drive hunting, where a pod of animals is driven together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. This type of fishery for harbour porpoises is best documented from the Danish straits, where it occurred until the end of the 19th century (it was banned in 1899), and again during the shortages in World War I and World War II. The Inuit in the Arctic hunt harbour porpoises by shooting and drive hunt for Dall&#x27;s porpoise still takes place in Japan. The number of individuals taken each year is in the thousands, although a quota of around 17,000 per year is in effect today making it the largest direct hunt of any cetacean species in the world and the sustainability of the hunt has been questioned.

====Fishing====
Porpoises are highly affected by bycatch. Many porpoises, mainly the vaquita, are subject to great mortality due to gillnetting. Although it is the world&#x27;s most endangered marine cetacean, the vaquita continues to be caught in small-mesh gillnet fisheries throughout much of its range. Incidental mortality caused by the fleet of El Golfo de Santa Clara was estimated to be at around 39 vaquitas per year, which is over 17% of the population size. Harbour porpoises also suffer drowning by gillnetting, but on a less threatening scale due to their high population; their mortality rate per year increases a mere 5% due to this.

The fishing market, historically has always had a porpoise bycatch. Today, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 has enforced the use of safer fishing equipment to reduce bycatch.

====Environmental hazards====

Porpoises are very sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances, and are keystone species, which can indicate the overall health of the marine environment. Populations of harbor porpoises in the North and Baltic Seas are under increasing pressure from anthropogenic causes such as offshore construction, ship traffic, fishing, and military exercises. Increasing pollution is a serious problem for marine mammals. Heavy metals and plastic waste are not biodegradable, and sometimes cetaceans consume these hazardous materials, mistaking them for food items. As a result, the animals are more susceptible to diseases and have fewer offspring. Harbour porpoises from the English Channel were found to have accumulated heavy metals.

The military and geologists employ strong sonar and produce an increases in noise in the oceans. Marine mammals that make use of biosonar for orientation and communication are not only hindered by the extra noise, but may race to the surface in panic. This may lead to a bubbling out of blood gases, and the animal then dies because the blood vessels become blocked, so-called decompression sickness. This effect, of course, only occurs in porpoises that dive to great depths, such as Dall&#x27;s porpoise.

Additionally, civilian vessels produce sonar waves to measure the depth of the body of water in which they are. Similar to the navy, some boats produce waves that attract porpoises, while others may repel them. The problem with the waves that attract is that the animal may be injured or even killed by being hit by the vessel or its propeller.

===Conservation===
The harbour porpoise, spectacled porpoise, Burmeister&#x27;s porpoise, and Dall&#x27;s porpoise are all listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). In addition, the Harbour porpoise is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS), the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS) and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia. Their conservation statuses are either at least concern or data deficient.

As of 2014, only 505 Yangtze finless porpoises remained in the main section of the Yangtze, with an alarming population density in Ezhou and Zhenjiang. While many threatened species decline rate slows after their classification, population decline rates of the porpoise are actually accelerating. While population decline tracked from 1994 to 2008 has been pegged at a rate of 6.06% annually, from 2006 to 2012, the porpoise population decreased by more than half. Finless porpoise population decrease of 69.8% in just a 22-year span from 1976 to 2000. 5.3%. A majority of factors of this population decline are being driven by the massive growth in Chinese industry since 1990 which caused increased shipping and pollution and ultimately environmental degradation. Some of these can be seen in damming of the river as well as illegal fishing activity. To protect the species, China&#x27;s Ministry of Agriculture classified the species as being National First Grade Key Protected Wild Animal, the strictest classification by law, meaning it is illegal to bring harm to a porpoise. Protective measures in the Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Nature Reserve has increased its population of porpoises from five to forty in 25 years. The Chinese Academy of Science&#x27;s Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology has been working with the World Wildlife Fund to ensure the future for this subspecies, and have placed five porpoises in another well-protected area, the He-wang-miao oxbow. Five protected natural reserves have been established in areas of the highest population density and mortality rates with measures being taken to ban patrolling and harmful fishing gear in those areas. There have also been efforts to study porpoise biology to help specialize conservation through captivation breeding. The Baiji Dolphinarium, was established in 1992 at the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan which allowing the study of behavioral and biological factors affecting the finless porpoise, specifically breeding biology like seasonal changes in reproductive hormones and breeding behavior.

Because vaquitas are indigenous to the Gulf of California, Mexico is leading conservation efforts with the creation of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA), which has tried to prevent the accidental deaths of vaquitas by outlawing the use of fishing nets within the vaquita&#x27;s habitat. CIRVA has worked together with the CITES, the Endangered Species Act, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) to nurse the vaquita population back to a point at which they can sustain themselves. CIRVA concluded in 2000 that between 39 and 84 individuals are killed each year by such gillnets. To try to prevent extinction, the Mexican government has created a nature reserve covering the upper part of the Gulf of California and the Colorado River delta. They have also placed a temporary ban on fishing, with compensation to those affected, that may pose a threat to the vaquita.

<doc id="46038" wikidata="Q60887" url="?curid=46038" title="Jeremy Bentham">
<text>Jeremy Bentham (; 4 February 1747/8 O.S. [15 February 1748 N.S.] – 6 June 1832) was an English philosopher, jurist, and social reformer regarded as the founder of modern utilitarianism.

Bentham defined as the &quot;fundamental axiom&quot; of his philosophy the principle that &quot;it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong.&quot; He became a leading theorist in Anglo-American philosophy of law, and a political radical whose ideas influenced the development of welfarism. He advocated individual and economic freedoms, the separation of church and state, freedom of expression, equal rights for women, the right to divorce, and (in an unpublished essay) the decriminalising of homosexual acts. He called for the abolition of slavery, capital punishment, and physical punishment, including that of children. He has also become known as an early advocate of animal rights. Though strongly in favour of the extension of individual legal rights, he opposed the idea of natural law and natural rights (both of which are considered &quot;divine&quot; or &quot;God-given&quot; in origin), calling them &quot;nonsense upon stilts&quot;. However, he viewed the Magna Carta as important, citing it to argue that the treatment of convicts in Australia was unlawful. Bentham was also a sharp critic of legal fictions.

Bentham&#x27;s students included his secretary and collaborator James Mill, the latter&#x27;s son, John Stuart Mill, the legal philosopher John Austin and American writer and activist John Neal. He &quot;had considerable influence on the reform of prisons, schools, poor laws, law courts, and Parliament itself.&quot;

On his death in 1832, Bentham left instructions for his body to be first dissected and then to be permanently preserved as an &quot;auto-icon&quot; (or self-image), which would be his memorial. This was done, and the auto-icon is now on public display in the entrance of the Student Centre at University College London (UCL). Because of his arguments in favour of the general availability of education, he has been described as the &quot;spiritual founder&quot; of UCL. However, he played only a limited direct part in its foundation.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Bentham was born on 4 February 1747/8 O.S. [15 February 1748 N.S.] in Houndsditch, London, to attorney Jeremiah Bentham and Alicia Woodward, widow of a Mr Whitehorne and daughter of mercer Thomas Grove, of Andover. His wealthy family were supporters of the Tory party. He was reportedly a child prodigy: he was found as a toddler sitting at his father&#x27;s desk reading a multi-volume history of England, and he began to study Latin at the age of three. He learnt to play the violin, and at the age of seven Bentham would perform sonatas by Handel during dinner parties. He had one surviving sibling, Samuel Bentham (1757–1831), with whom he was close.

He attended Westminster School; in 1760, at age 12, his father sent him to The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1764, receiving the title of MA in 1767. He trained as a lawyer and, though he never practised, was called to the bar in 1769. He became deeply frustrated with the complexity of English law, which he termed the &quot;Demon of Chicane&quot;. When the American colonies published their Declaration of Independence in July 1776, the British government did not issue any official response but instead secretly commissioned London lawyer and pamphleteer John Lind to publish a rebuttal. His 130-page tract was distributed in the colonies and contained an essay titled &quot;Short Review of the Declaration&quot; written by Bentham, a friend of Lind, which attacked and mocked the Americans&#x27; political philosophy.

=== Abortive prison project and the Panopticon ===
In 1786 and 1787, Bentham travelled to Krichev in White Russia (modern Belarus) to visit his brother, Samuel, who was engaged in managing various industrial and other projects for Prince Potemkin. It was Samuel (as Jeremy later repeatedly acknowledged) who conceived the basic idea of a circular building at the hub of a larger compound as a means of allowing a small number of managers to oversee the activities of a large and unskilled workforce.

Bentham began to develop this model, particularly as applicable to prisons, and outlined his ideas in a series of letters sent home to his father in England. He supplemented the supervisory principle with the idea of &quot;contract management&quot;; that is, an administration by contract as opposed to trust, where the director would have a pecuniary interest in lowering the average rate of mortality.

The Panopticon was intended to be cheaper than the prisons of his time, as it required fewer staff; &quot;Allow me to construct a prison on this model&quot;, Bentham requested to a Committee for the Reform of Criminal Law, &quot;I will be the gaoler. You will see ... that the gaoler will have no salary—will cost nothing to the nation.&quot; As the watchmen cannot be seen, they need not be on duty at all times, effectively leaving the watching to the watched. According to Bentham&#x27;s design, the prisoners would also be used as menial labour, walking on wheels to spin looms or run a water wheel. This would decrease the cost of the prison and give a possible source of income.

The ultimately abortive proposal for a panopticon prison to be built in England was one among his many proposals for legal and social reform. But Bentham spent some sixteen years of his life developing and refining his ideas for the building and hoped that the government would adopt the plan for a National Penitentiary appointing him as contractor-governor. Although the prison was never built, the concept had an important influence on later generations of thinkers. Twentieth-century French philosopher Michel Foucault argued that the panopticon was paradigmatic of several 19th-century &quot;disciplinary&quot; institutions. Bentham remained bitter throughout his later life about the rejection of the panopticon scheme, convinced that it had been thwarted by the King and an aristocratic elite. Philip Schofield argues that it was largely because of his sense of injustice and frustration that he developed his ideas of &quot;sinister interest&quot;—that is, of the vested interests of the powerful conspiring against a wider public interest—which underpinned many of his broader arguments for reform.

On his return to England from Russia, Bentham had commissioned drawings from an architect, Willey Reveley. In 1791, he published the material he had written as a book, although he continued to refine his proposals for many years to come. He had by now decided that he wanted to see the prison built: when finished, it would be managed by himself as contractor-governor, with the assistance of Samuel. After unsuccessful attempts to interest the authorities in Ireland and revolutionary France, he started trying to persuade the prime minister, William Pitt, to revive an earlier abandoned scheme for a National Penitentiary in England, this time to be built as a panopticon. He was eventually successful in winning over Pitt and his advisors, and in 1794 was paid £2,000 for preliminary work on the project.

The intended site was one that had been authorised, under the Appropriation Act 1799 (39 Geo. 3. c. 114) for the earlier penitentiary, at Battersea Rise; but the new proposals ran into technical legal problems and objections from the local landowner, Earl Spencer. Other sites were considered, including one at Hanging Wood, near Woolwich, but all proved unsatisfactory. Eventually Bentham turned to a site at Tothill Fields, near Westminster. Although this was common land, with no landowner, there were a number of parties with interests in it, including Earl Grosvenor, who owned a house on an adjacent site and objected to the idea of a prison overlooking it. Again, therefore, the scheme ground to a halt At this point, however, it became clear that a nearby site at Millbank, adjoining the Thames, was available for sale, and this time things ran more smoothly. Using government money, Bentham bought the land on behalf of the Crown for £12,000 in November 1799.

From his point of view, the site was far from ideal, being marshy, unhealthy, and too small. When he asked the government for more land and more money, however, the response was that he should build only a small-scale experimental prison—which he interpreted as meaning that there was little real commitment to the concept of the panopticon as a cornerstone of penal reform. Negotiations continued, but in 1801 Pitt resigned from office, and in 1803 the new Addington administration decided not to proceed with the project. Bentham was devastated: &quot;They have murdered my best days.&quot;

Nevertheless, a few years later the government revived the idea of a National Penitentiary, and in 1811 and 1812 returned specifically to the idea of a panopticon. Bentham, now aged 63, was still willing to be governor. However, as it became clear that there was still no real commitment to the proposal, he abandoned hope, and instead turned his attentions to extracting financial compensation for his years of fruitless effort. His initial claim was for the enormous sum of nearly £700,000, but he eventually settled for the more modest (but still considerable) sum of £23,000. The Penitentiary House, etc. Act 1812 (52 Geo. 3. c. 44) transferred his title in the site to the Crown.

More successful was his cooperation with Patrick Colquhoun in tackling the corruption in the Pool of London. This resulted in the Depredations on the Thames Act 1800 (39 &amp; 40 Geo. 3. c. 87). The Act created the Thames River Police, which was the first preventive police force in the country and was a precedent for Robert Peel&#x27;s reforms 30 years later.

=== Correspondence and contemporary influences ===

Bentham was in correspondence with many influential people. In the 1780s, for example, Bentham maintained a correspondence with the ageing Adam Smith, in an unsuccessful attempt to convince Smith that interest rates should be allowed to freely float. As a result of his correspondence with Mirabeau and other leaders of the French Revolution, Bentham was declared an honorary citizen of France. He was an outspoken critic of the revolutionary discourse of natural rights and of the violence that arose after the Jacobins took power (1792). Between 1808 and 1810, he held a personal friendship with Latin American revolutionary Francisco de Miranda and paid visits to Miranda&#x27;s Grafton Way house in London. He also developed links with José Cecilio del Valle.

In 1821, John Cartwright proposed to Bentham that they serve as &quot;Guardians of Constitutional Reform&quot;, seven &quot;wise men&quot; whose reports and observations would &quot;concern the entire Democracy or Commons of the United Kingdom&quot;. Describing himself, among the names mentioned which also included Sir Francis Burdett, George Ensor, and Sir Matthew Wood, and as a &quot;nonentity&quot;, Bentham declined the offer.

===South Australian colony proposal===

On 3 August 1831 the Committee of the National Colonization Society approved the printing of its proposal to establish a free colony on the south coast of Australia, funded by the sale of appropriated colonial lands, overseen by a joint-stock company, and which would be granted powers of self-government as soon as was practicable. Contrary to assumptions, Bentham had no hand in the preparation of the &#x27;Proposal to His Majesty&#x27;s Government for founding a colony on the Southern Coast of Australia, which was prepared under the auspices of Robert Gouger, Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, and Anthony Bacon. Bentham did, however, in August 1831, draft an unpublished work entitled &#x27;Colonization Company Proposal&#x27;, which constitutes his commentary upon the National Colonization Society&#x27;s &#x27;Proposal&#x27;.

=== Westminster Review ===
In 1823, he co-founded &quot;The Westminster Review&quot; with James Mill as a journal for the &quot;Philosophical Radicals&quot;—a group of younger disciples through whom Bentham exerted considerable influence in British public life. One was John Bowring, to whom Bentham became devoted, describing their relationship as &quot;son and father&quot;: he appointed Bowring political editor of &quot;The Westminster Review&quot; and eventually his literary executor. Another was Edwin Chadwick, who wrote on hygiene, sanitation, and policing and was a major contributor to the Poor Law Amendment Act: Bentham employed Chadwick as a secretary and bequeathed him a large legacy.

===Personal life===
Bentham lived a highly structured and disciplined life, but he also exhibited eccentric behavior. He referred to his walking stick as &quot;Dapple&quot; and his cat as &quot;The Reverend Sir John Langbourne.&quot; He had several infatuations with women, and wrote on sex. But he never married. Bentham&#x27;s daily pattern was to rise at 6 am, walk for 2 hours or more, and then work until 4 pm.

An insight into his character is given in Michael St. John Packe&#x27;s &quot;The Life of John Stuart Mill&quot;:

A psychobiographical study by Philip Lucas and Anne Sheeran argues that he may have had Asperger&#x27;s syndrome.

== Work ==
=== Animal rights ===
Bentham is widely regarded as one of the earliest proponents of animal rights. He argued and believed that the ability to suffer, not the ability to reason, should be the benchmark, or what he called the &quot;insuperable line&quot;. If reason alone were the criterion by which we judge who ought to have rights, human infants and adults with certain forms of disability might fall short, too. In 1780, alluding to the limited degree of legal protection afforded to slaves in the French West Indies by the Code Noir, he wrote:Earlier in the paragraph, Bentham makes clear that he accepted that animals could be killed for food, or in defence of human life, provided that the animal was not made to suffer unnecessarily. Bentham did not object to medical experiments on animals, providing that the experiments had in mind a particular goal of benefit to humanity, and had a reasonable chance of achieving that goal. He wrote that otherwise he had a &quot;decided and insuperable objection&quot; to causing pain to animals, in part because of the harmful effects such practices might have on human beings. In a letter to the editor of the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; in March 1825, he wrote:

=== Economics ===

Bentham&#x27;s opinions about monetary economics were completely different from those of David Ricardo; however, they had some similarities to those of Henry Thornton. He focused on monetary expansion as a means of helping to create full employment. He was also aware of the relevance of forced saving, propensity to consume, the saving-investment relationship, and other matters that form the content of modern income and employment analysis. His monetary view was close to the fundamental concepts employed in his model of utilitarian decision making. His work is considered to be an early precursor of modern welfare economics.

Bentham stated that pleasures and pains can be ranked according to their value or &quot;dimension&quot; such as intensity, duration, certainty of a pleasure or a pain. He was concerned with maxima and minima of pleasures and pains; and they set a precedent for the future employment of the maximisation principle in the economics of the consumer, the firm and the search for an optimum in welfare economics.

Bentham advocated &quot;Pauper Management&quot; which involved the creation of a chain of large workhouses.

Lawless writes that Bentham&#x27;s &quot;theoretical contributions to the political, economic, legal and psychological structures of English capitalism were enormous. Even Marx moved through a world that had been well-described by the arch-Philistine&#x27;s voice. In his unique way, Bentham defined and analyzed the England of the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries, creating not only a comprehensive social theory but, with the help of James Mill and others, a political movement to go with it .&quot;.

=== Theory of Fictions ===
Bentham’s Theory of Fictions explored how language shapes thought, particularly in legal and political discourse. He distinguished between &quot;fabulous entities&quot;, which are purely imaginary (e.g., literary or mythological figures like Prince Hamlet or a centaur), and &quot;fictitious entities&quot;, which have no physical existence but are essential for reasoning (e.g., laws, rights, and obligations). Similar to Kant&#x27;s categories, such as nature, custom, or the social contract, these fictitious entities help structure human understanding but do not exist independently.

While Bentham acknowledged the necessity of &quot;fictitious entities&quot; for communication, he warned that they could obscure truth and be manipulated for deception, especially in law. He viewed legal fictions — such as the notion of corporate personhood or sovereignty — as tools that could be either useful or misleading, depending on their application. His analysis influenced later thinkers in legal theory, philosophy of language, and utilitarian ethics, advocating for clarity and empirical reasoning in public affairs.

=== Gender and sexuality ===
Bentham said that it was the placing of women in a legally inferior position that made him choose in 1759, at the age of eleven, the career of a reformist, though American critic John Neal claimed to have convinced him to take up women&#x27;s rights issues during their association between 1825 and 1827. Bentham spoke for a complete equality between the sexes, arguing in favour of women&#x27;s suffrage, a woman&#x27;s right to obtain a divorce, and a woman&#x27;s right to hold political office.

The essay &quot;Paederasty (Offences Against One&#x27;s Self)&quot; argued for the liberalisation of laws prohibiting homosexual sex. The essay remained unpublished during his lifetime for fear of offending public morality. Some of Bentham&#x27;s writings on &quot;sexual non-conformity&quot; were published for the first time in 1931, but &quot;Paederasty&quot; was not published until 1978. Bentham does not believe homosexual acts to be unnatural, describing them merely as &quot;irregularities of the venereal appetite&quot;. The essay chastises the society of the time for making a disproportionate response to what Bentham appears to consider a largely private offence—public displays or forced acts being dealt with rightly by other laws. When the essay was published in the &quot;Journal of Homosexuality&quot; in 1978, the abstract stated that Bentham&#x27;s essay was the &quot;first known argument for homosexual law reform in England&quot;.

=== Imperialism ===
Bentham&#x27;s writings in the early 1790s onwards expressed an opposition to imperialism. His 1793 pamphlet &quot;Emancipate Your Colonies!&quot; critiqued French colonialism. In the early 1820s, he argued that the liberal government in Spain should emancipate its New World colonies. In the essay &quot;Plan for an Universal and Perpetual Peace&quot;, Bentham argued that Britain should emancipate its New World colonies and abandon its colonial ambitions. He argued that empire was bad for the greatest number in the metropole and the colonies. According to Bentham, empire was financially unsound, entailed taxation on the poor in the metropole, caused unnecessary expansion in the military apparatus, undermined the security of the metropole, and were ultimately motivated by misguided ideas of honour and glory.

=== Law reform ===

Bentham was the first person to be an aggressive advocate for the codification of &quot;all&quot; of the common law into a coherent set of statutes; he was actually the person who coined the verb &quot;to codify&quot; to refer to the process of drafting a legal code. He lobbied hard for the formation of codification commissions in both England and the United States, and went so far as to write to President James Madison in 1811 to volunteer to write a complete legal code for the young country. After he learned more about American law and realised that most of it was state-based, he promptly wrote to the governors of every single state with the same offer.

During his lifetime, Bentham&#x27;s codification efforts were completely unsuccessful. Even today, they have been completely rejected by almost every common law jurisdiction, including England. However, his writings on the subject laid the foundation for the moderately successful codification work of David Dudley Field II in the United States a generation later.

=== Privacy ===
For Bentham, transparency had moral value. For example, journalism puts power-holders under moral scrutiny. However, Bentham wanted such transparency to apply to everyone influential. This he describes by picturing the world as a gymnasium in which each &quot;gesture, every turn of limb or feature, in those whose motions have a visible impact on the general happiness, will be noticed and marked down&quot;. He considered both surveillance and transparency to be useful ways of generating understanding and improvements for people&#x27;s lives.

=== Racial views ===
Bentham believed each race to be different, independent of climate or place of birth. He wrote in &quot;An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation&quot;:
=== Utilitarianism ===
Bentham today is considered as the &quot;Father of Utilitarianism&quot;. His ambition in life was to create a &quot;Pannomion&quot;, a complete utilitarian code of law. He not only proposed many legal and social reforms, but also expounded an underlying moral principle on which they should be based. This philosophy of utilitarianism took for its &quot;fundamental axiom&quot; to be the notion that &quot;it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong&quot;. Bentham claimed to have borrowed this concept from the writings of Joseph Priestley, although the closest that Priestley in fact came to expressing it was in the form &quot;the good and happiness of the members, that is the majority of the members of any state, is the great standard by which relating to that state must finally be determined.&quot;

Bentham was a rare major figure in the history of philosophy to endorse psychological egoism. He was also a determined opponent of religion, as Crimmins observes: &quot;Between 1809 and 1823 Jeremy Bentham carried out an exhaustive examination of religion with the declared aim of extirpating religious beliefs, even the idea of religion itself, from the minds of men.&quot;

Bentham also suggested a procedure for estimating the moral status of any action, which he called the hedonistic or felicific calculus.

Principle of utility

The principle of utility, or &quot;greatest happiness principle&quot;, forms the cornerstone of all Bentham&#x27;s thought. By &quot;happiness&quot;, he understood a predominance of &quot;pleasure&quot; over &quot;pain&quot;. He wrote in &quot;An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation&quot;:

Bentham&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Morals and Legislation&quot; focuses on the principle of utility and how this view of morality ties into legislative practices. His principle of utility regards &quot;good&quot; as that which produces the greatest amount of pleasure and the minimum amount of pain and &quot;evil&quot; as that which produces the most pain without the pleasure. This concept of pleasure and pain is defined by Bentham as physical as well as spiritual. Bentham writes about this principle as it manifests itself within the legislation of a society.

In order to measure the extent of pain or pleasure that a certain decision will create, he lays down a set of criteria divided into the categories of intensity, duration, certainty, proximity, productiveness, purity, and extent. Using these measurements, he reviews the concept of punishment and when it should be used as far as whether a punishment will create more pleasure or more pain for a society.

He calls for legislators to determine whether punishment creates an even more evil offence. Instead of suppressing the evil acts, Bentham argues that certain unnecessary laws and punishments could ultimately lead to new and more dangerous vices than those being punished to begin with, and calls upon legislators to measure the pleasures and pains associated with any legislation and to form laws in order to create the greatest good for the greatest number. He argues that the concept of the individual pursuing his or her own happiness cannot be necessarily declared &quot;right&quot;, because often these individual pursuits can lead to greater pain and less pleasure for a society as a whole. Therefore, the legislation of a society is vital to maintain the maximum pleasure and the minimum degree of pain for the greatest number of people.

==== Hedonistic/felicific calculus ====
In his exposition of the felicific calculus, Bentham proposed a classification of 12 pains and 14 pleasures, by which we might test the &quot;happiness factor&quot; of any action. For Bentham, according to P. J. Kelly, the law &quot;provides the basic framework of social interaction by delimiting spheres of personal inviolability within which individuals can form and pursue their own conceptions of well-being&quot;. It provides security, a precondition for the formation of expectations. As the hedonic calculus shows &quot;expectation utilities&quot; to be much higher than natural ones, it follows that Bentham does not favour the sacrifice of a few to the benefit of the many. Law professor Alan Dershowitz has quoted Bentham to argue that torture should sometimes be permitted.

==== Criticisms ====
Utilitarianism was revised and expanded by Bentham&#x27;s student John Stuart Mill, who sharply criticised Bentham&#x27;s view of human nature, which failed to recognise conscience as a human motive. Mill considered Bentham&#x27;s view &quot;to have done and to be doing very serious evil.&quot; In Mill&#x27;s hands, &quot;Benthamism&quot; became a major element in the liberal conception of state policy objectives.

Bentham&#x27;s critics have claimed that he undermined the foundation of a free society by rejecting natural rights. Historian Gertrude Himmelfarb wrote &quot;The principle of the greatest happiness of the greatest number was as inimical to the idea of liberty as to the idea of rights.&quot;

Bentham&#x27;s &quot;hedonistic&quot; theory (a term from J. J. C. Smart) is often criticised for lacking a principle of fairness embodied in a conception of justice. In &quot;Bentham and the Common Law Tradition&quot;, Gerald J. Postema states: &quot;No moral concept suffers more at Bentham&#x27;s hand than the concept of justice. There is no sustained, mature analysis of the notion.&quot; Thus, some critics object, it would be acceptable to torture one person if this would produce an amount of happiness in other people outweighing the unhappiness of the tortured individual. However, as P. J. Kelly argued in &quot;Utilitarianism and Distributive Justice: Jeremy Bentham and the Civil Law&quot;, Bentham had a theory of justice that prevented such consequences.

== Legacy ==

Bentham influenced economists such as Milton Friedman and Henry Hazlitt.

In their youth, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels were interested in Bentham&#x27;s ideas and utilitarian philosophy. Marx later became disillusioned with Bentham&#x27;s ideas, describing him as &quot;a genius of bourgeois stupidity&quot;, and viewed Bentham&#x27;s views as too English and &quot;petite bourgeoisie&quot;, saying &quot;With the dullest naïveté he takes the modern petty-bourgeois philistine, especially the English philistine, as the normal man. Whatever is useful to this queer variety of normal man, and to his world, is useful in and for itself. This yardstick, then, he applies to past, present and future.&quot;

The Faculty of Laws at University College London occupies Bentham House, next to the main UCL campus.

Bentham&#x27;s name was adopted by the Australian litigation funder IMF Limited to become Bentham IMF Limited on 28 November 2013, in recognition of Bentham being &quot;among the first to support the utility of litigation funding&quot;.

=== Death and the auto-icon ===

Bentham died on 6 June 1832, aged 84, at his residence in Queen Square Place in Westminster, London. He had continued to write up to a month before his death, and had made careful preparations for the dissection of his body after death and its preservation as an auto-icon. As early as 1769, when Bentham was 21 years old, he made a will leaving his body for dissection to a family friend, the physician and chemist George Fordyce, whose daughter, Maria Sophia (1765–1858), married Jeremy&#x27;s brother Samuel Bentham. A paper written in 1830, instructing Thomas Southwood Smith to create the auto-icon, was attached to his last will, dated 30 May 1832. It stated:

Bentham&#x27;s wish to preserve his dead body was consistent with his philosophy of utilitarianism. In his essay &quot;Auto-Icon, or the Uses of the Dead to the Living&quot;, Bentham wrote, &quot;If a country gentleman has rows of trees leading to his dwelling, the auto-icons of his family might alternate with the trees; copal varnish would protect the face from the effects of rain.&quot; On 8 June 1832, two days after his death, invitations were distributed to a select group of friends, and on the following day at 3 p.m., Southwood Smith delivered a lengthy oration over Bentham&#x27;s remains in the Webb Street School of Anatomy &amp; Medicine in Southwark, London. The printed oration contains a frontispiece with an engraving of Bentham&#x27;s body partly covered by a sheet.

Afterward, the skeleton and head were preserved and stored in a wooden cabinet called the &quot;auto-icon&quot;, with the skeleton padded out with hay and dressed in Bentham&#x27;s clothes. From 1833, it stood in Southwood Smith&#x27;s Finsbury Square consulting rooms until he abandoned private practice in the winter of 1849–50, when it was moved to 36 Percy Street, the studio of his unofficial partner, painter Margaret Gillies, who made studies of it. In March 1850, Southwood Smith offered the auto-icon to Henry Brougham, who readily accepted it for UCL.

It is currently kept on public display at the main entrance of the UCL Student Centre. It was previously displayed at the end of the South Cloisters in the main building of the college until it was moved in 2020. Upon the retirement of Sir Malcolm Grant as provost of the college in 2013, however, the body was present at Grant&#x27;s final council meeting. As of 2013, this was the only time that the body of Bentham has been taken to a UCL council meeting. (There is a persistent myth that the body of Bentham is present at all council meetings.)

Bentham had intended the auto-icon to incorporate his actual head, mummified to resemble its appearance in life. Southwood Smith&#x27;s experimental efforts at mummification – based on the preservation practices of New Zealand&#x27;s indigenous Māori – involved placing the head under an air pump over sulphuric acid and drawing off the fluids. Although technically successful, they left the head looking distastefully macabre, with dried and darkened skin stretched tautly over the skull.
The auto-icon was therefore given a wax head, fitted with some of Bentham&#x27;s own hair. The real head was displayed in the same case as the auto-icon for many years, but became the target of repeated student pranks. It was later locked away. 

In 2020, the auto-icon was put into a new glass display case and moved to the entrance of UCL&#x27;s new Student Centre on Gordon Square.

=== University College London ===

Bentham is widely associated with the foundation in 1826 of London University (the institution that, in 1836, became University College London), though he was 78 years old when the university opened and played only an indirect role in its establishment. His direct involvement was limited to his buying a single £100 share in the new university, making him just one of over a thousand shareholders.

Bentham and his ideas can nonetheless be seen as having inspired several of the actual founders of the university. He strongly believed that education should be more widely available, particularly to those who were not wealthy or who did not belong to the established church; in Bentham&#x27;s time, membership of the Church of England and the capacity to bear considerable expenses were required of students entering the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. As the University of London was the first in England to admit all, regardless of race, creed or political belief, it was largely consistent with Bentham&#x27;s vision. There is some evidence that, from the sidelines, he played a &quot;more than passive part&quot; in the planning discussions for the new institution, although it is also apparent that &quot;his interest was greater than his influence&quot;. He failed in his efforts to see his disciple John Bowring appointed professor of English or History, but he did oversee the appointment of another pupil, John Austin, as the first professor of Jurisprudence in 1829.

The more direct associations between Bentham and UCL—the college&#x27;s custody of his Auto-icon (see above) and of the majority of his surviving papers—postdate his death by some years: the papers were donated in 1849, and the Auto-icon in 1850. A large painting by Henry Tonks hanging in UCL&#x27;s Flaxman Gallery depicts Bentham approving the plans of the new university, but it was executed in 1922 and the scene is entirely imaginary. Since 1959 (when the Bentham Committee was first established), UCL has hosted the Bentham Project, which is progressively publishing a definitive edition of Bentham&#x27;s writings.

UCL now endeavours to acknowledge Bentham&#x27;s influence on its foundation, while avoiding any suggestion of direct involvement, by describing him as its &quot;spiritual founder&quot;.

== Bibliography ==


Bentham was an obsessive writer and reviser, but was only able on rare occasions of bringing his work to completion and publication. Most of what appeared in print in his lifetime was prepared for publication by others. Several of his works first appeared in French translation, prepared for the press by Étienne Dumont, for example, &quot;Theory of Legislation&quot;, Volume 2 (&quot;Principles of the Penal Code&quot;) 1840, Weeks, Jordan, &amp; Company. Boston. Some made their first appearance in English in the 1820s as a result of back-translation from Dumont&#x27;s 1802 collection (and redaction) of Bentham&#x27;s writing on civil and penal legislation.

** This was an unsparing criticism of some introductory passages relating to political theory in William Blackstone&#x27;s Commentaries on the Laws of England. The book, published anonymously, was well received and credited to some of the greatest minds of the time. Bentham disagreed with Blackstone&#x27;s defence of judge-made law, his defence of legal fictions, his theological formulation of the doctrine of mixed government, his appeal to a social contract and his use of the vocabulary of natural law. Bentham&#x27;s &quot;Fragment&quot; was only a small part of a Commentary on the Commentaries, which remained unpublished until the twentieth century.

** Bentham wrote a series of thirteen &quot;Letters&quot; addressed to Adam Smith, published in 1787 as &quot;Defence of Usury&quot;. Bentham&#x27;s main argument against the restriction is that &quot;projectors&quot; generate positive externalities. G. K. Chesterton identified Bentham&#x27;s essay on usury as the very beginning of the &quot;modern world&quot;. Bentham&#x27;s arguments were very influential. &quot;Writers of eminence&quot; moved to abolish the restriction, and repeal was achieved in stages and fully achieved in England in 1854. There is little evidence as to Smith&#x27;s reaction. He did not revise the offending passages in &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; (1776), but Smith made little or no substantial revisions after the third edition of 1784.

=== Posthumous publications ===
On his death, Bentham left manuscripts amounting to an estimated 30 million words, which are now largely held by University College London&#x27;s Special Collections ( manuscript folios) and the British Library ( folios). University College London also holds a collection of c.500 books either by, about, or owned by Jeremy Bentham.

==== Bowring (1838–1843) ====
John Bowring, the young radical writer who had been Bentham&#x27;s intimate friend and disciple, was appointed his literary executor and charged with the task of preparing a collected edition of his works. This appeared in 11 volumes in 1838–1843. Bowring based much of his edition on previously published texts (including those of Dumont) rather than Bentham&#x27;s own manuscripts, and elected not to publish Bentham&#x27;s works on religion at all. The edition was described by the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; on first publication as &quot;incomplete, incorrect and ill-arranged&quot;, and has since been repeatedly criticised both for its omissions and for errors of detail; while Bowring&#x27;s memoir of Bentham&#x27;s life included in volumes 10 and 11 was described by Sir Leslie Stephen as &quot;one of the worst biographies in the language&quot;. Nevertheless, Bowring&#x27;s remained the standard edition of most of Bentham&#x27;s writings for over a century, and is still only partially superseded: it includes such interesting writings on international relations as Bentham&#x27;s A Plan for an Universal and Perpetual Peace written 1786–89, which forms part IV of the Principles of International Law.

==== Stark (1952–1954) ====
In 1952–1954, Werner Stark published a three-volume set, &quot;Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s Economic Writings&quot;, in which he attempted to bring together all of Bentham&#x27;s writings on economic matters, including both published and unpublished material. Although a significant achievement, the work is considered by scholars to be flawed in many points of detail, and a new edition of the economic writings (retitled &quot;Writings on Political Economy&quot;) is currently in course of publication by the Bentham Project.

==== Bentham Project (1968–present) ====

In 1959, the Bentham Committee was established under the auspices of University College London with the aim of producing a definitive edition of Bentham&#x27;s writings. It set up the Bentham Project to undertake the task, and the first volume in &quot;The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham&quot; was published in 1968. The &quot;Collected Works&quot; are providing many unpublished works, as well as much-improved texts of works already published. To date, 38 volumes have appeared; the complete edition is projected to total 80. The volume &quot;Of Laws in General&quot; (1970) was found to contain many errors and has been replaced by &quot;Of the Limits of the Penal Branch of Jurisprudence&quot; (2010) In 2017, Volumes 1–5 were re-published in open access by UCL Press.

To assist in this task, the Bentham papers at UCL are being digitised by crowdsourcing their transcription. Transcribe Bentham is a crowdsourced manuscript transcription project, run by University College London&#x27;s Bentham Project, in partnership with UCL&#x27;s UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, UCL Library Services, UCL Learning and Media Services, the University of London Computer Centre, and the online community. The project was launched in September 2010 and is making freely available, via a specially designed transcription interface, digital images of UCL&#x27;s vast Bentham Papers collection—which runs to some 60,000 manuscript folios—to engage the public and recruit volunteers to help transcribe the material. Volunteer-produced transcripts will contribute to the Bentham Project&#x27;s production of the new edition of &quot;The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham&quot;, and will be uploaded to UCL&#x27;s digital Bentham Papers repository, widening access to the collection for all and ensuring its long-term preservation. Manuscripts can be viewed and transcribed by signing-up for a transcriber account at the Transcription Desk, via the Transcribe Bentham website.

Free, flexible textual search of the full collection of Bentham Papers is now possible through an experimental handwritten text image indexing and search system, developed by the PRHLT research center in the framework of the READ project.

<text>A pen name or nom-de-plume is a pseudonym (or, in some cases, a variant form of a real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page or by-line of their works in place of their real name.

A pen name may be used to make the author&#x27;s name more distinctive, to disguise the author&#x27;s gender, to distance the author from their other works, to protect the author from retribution for their writings, to merge multiple persons into a single identifiable author, or for any of several reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work.

The author&#x27;s real identity may be known only to the publisher or may become common knowledge. In some cases, such as those of Elena Ferrante and Torsten Krol, a pen name may preserve an author&#x27;s long-term anonymity.

==Etymology==
&quot;Pen name&quot; is formed by joining pen with name. Its earliest use in English is in the 1860s, in the writings of Bayard Taylor.

The French-language phrase is used as a synonym for &quot;pen name&quot; ( means &#x27;pen&#x27;). However, it is not the French usage, according to H. W. Fowler and F. G. Fowler in &quot;The King&#x27;s English&quot;, but instead a &quot;back-translation&quot; from English. The French usage is &quot;nom de guerre&quot; (a more generalised term for &#x27;pseudonym&#x27;). Since means &#x27;war&#x27; in French, confused some English speakers, who &quot;corrected&quot; the French metaphor. This phrase precedes &quot;pen name&quot;, being attested to &quot;The Knickerbocker&quot;, in 1841.

==Western literature==
===Europe and the United States===
An author may use a pen name if their real name is likely to be confused with that of another author or other significant individual. For instance, in 1899 the British politician Winston Churchill wrote under the name Winston S. Churchill to distinguish his writings from those of the American novelist of the same name.

An author may use a pen name implying a rank or title which they have never actually held. William Earl Johns wrote under the name &quot;Capt. W. E. Johns&quot; although the highest army rank he held was acting lieutenant and his highest air force rank was flying officer.

Authors who regularly write in more than one genre may use different pen names for each, either in an attempt to conceal their true identity or even after their identity is known. Romance writer Nora Roberts writes erotic thrillers under the pen name J. D. Robb (such books were originally listed as by &quot;J. D. Robb&quot; and are now titled &quot;Nora Roberts writing as J. D. Robb&quot;); Scots writer Iain Banks wrote mainstream or literary fiction under his own name and science fiction under Iain M. Banks; Samuel Langhorne Clemens used the aliases Mark Twain and Sieur Louis de Conte for different works. Similarly, an author who writes both fiction and non-fiction (such as the mathematician and fantasy writer Charles Dodgson, who wrote as Lewis Carroll) may use a pseudonym for fiction writing. Science fiction author Harry Turtledove has used the name H. N. Turtletaub for some historical novels he has written because he and his publisher felt that the presumed lower sales of those novels might hurt bookstore orders for the novels he writes under his name.

Even within the same genre, authors may use a pen name if their better-known name may lead potential readers to misunderstand the nature of the book. In children&#x27;s picture books, Dr. Seuss — itself a whimsical pen name for Theodor Geisel originating when he was banned from illustrating for his college humor magazine due to illegal drinking — used the name &quot;Theo. LeSieg,&quot; &quot;LeSieg&quot; being &quot;Geisel&quot; spelled backward, on books he wrote but did not illustrate. Geisel&#x27;s bestselling books had become associated with a very recognizable art style, which the LeSieg books lacked. Later in his career, Geisel did publish two books illustrated by others under his primary pen name, and following his death the LeSieg books have been reissued as by Dr. Seuss, &quot;writing as Theo. LeSieg.&quot;

Occasionally, a pen name is employed to avoid overexposure. Prolific authors for pulp magazines often had two and sometimes three short stories appearing in one issue of a magazine; the editor would create several fictitious author names to hide this from readers. Robert A. Heinlein wrote stories under the pseudonyms of Anson MacDonald (a combination of his middle name and his then-wife&#x27;s maiden name) and Caleb Strong so that more of his works could be published in a single magazine. Stephen King published four novels under the name Richard Bachman because publishers did not feel the public would buy more than one novel per year from a single author. Eventually, after critics found a large number of style similarities, publishers revealed Bachman&#x27;s true identity.

Sometimes a pen name is used because an author believes that their name does not suit the genre they are writing in. Western novelist Pearl Gray dropped his first name and changed the spelling of his last name to Zane Grey because he believed that his real name did not suit the Western genre. Romance novelist Angela Knight writes under that name instead of her actual name (Julie Woodcock) because of the double entendre of her surname in the context of that genre. Romain Gary, who was a well-known French writer, decided in 1973 to write novels in a different style under the name Émile Ajar and even asked his cousin&#x27;s son to impersonate Ajar; thus he received the most prestigious French literary prize twice, which is forbidden by the prize rules. He revealed the affair in a book he sent his editor just before committing suicide in 1980.

A pen name may be shared by different writers to suggest continuity of authorship. Thus the &quot;Bessie Bunter&quot; series of English boarding school stories, initially written by the prolific Charles Hamilton under the name Hilda Richards, was taken on by other authors who continued to use the same pen name.

In some forms of fiction, the pen name adopted is the name of the lead character, to suggest to the reader that the book is an autobiography of a real person. Daniel Handler used the pseudonym Lemony Snicket to present his &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; books as memoirs by an acquaintance of the main characters. Some, however, do this to fit a certain theme. One example, Pseudonymous Bosch, used his pen name just to expand the theme of secrecy in &quot;The Secret Series&quot;.

Authors also may occasionally choose pen names to appear in more favorable positions in bookshops or libraries, to maximize visibility when placed on shelves that are conventionally arranged alphabetically moving horizontally, then upwards vertically.

===Female authors===
Some female authors have used pen names to ensure that their works were accepted by publishers and/or the public. Such is the case of Peru&#x27;s Clarinda, whose work was published in the early 17th century. More often, women have adopted masculine pen names. This was common in the 19th century when women were beginning to make inroads into literature but, it was felt they would not be taken as seriously by readers as male authors. For example, Mary Ann Evans wrote under the pen name George Eliot; and Amandine Aurore Lucile Dupin, and Baronne Dudevant, used the pseudonym George Sand. Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Brontë published under the names Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell, respectively. French-Savoyard writer and poet Amélie Gex chose to publish as Dian de Jeânna (&quot;John, son of Jane&quot;) during the first half of her career. Karen Blixen&#x27;s very successful &quot;Out of Africa&quot; (1937) was originally published under the pen name Isak Dinesen. Victoria Benedictsson, a Swedish author of the 19th century, wrote under the name Ernst Ahlgren. The science fiction author Alice B. Sheldon for many years published under the masculine name of James Tiptree, Jr., the discovery of which led to a deep discussion of gender in the genre.

More recently, women who write in genres commonly written by men sometimes choose to use initials, such as K. A. Applegate, C. J. Cherryh, P. N. Elrod, D. C. Fontana, S. E. Hinton, G. A. Riplinger, J. D. Robb, and J. K. Rowling, who also writes the &quot;Cormoran Strike&quot; series of crime fiction novels under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. Alternatively, they may use a unisex pen name, such as Robin Hobb (the second pen name of novelist Margaret Astrid Lindholm Ogden).

===Collective names===
A collective name, also known as a house name, is published under one pen name for works by the same publishing house even though more than one author may have contributed to the series. Novellas and paperback books credited to Maxwell Grant, featuring the adventures of The Shadow, were written largely by Walter B. Gibson but other writers contributed to the series. The erotic-adventures Slocum series of westerns were all credited to Jake Logan, but many different authors actually wrote the books. 

In some cases, the first books in a series were written by one writer but subsequent books were written by ghostwriters. For instance, Leslie Charteris wrote the early volumes of &quot;The Saint&quot; adventure series, but he supervised and edited the works of ghostwriters for the remainder of the series. Similarly, &quot;Nancy Drew&quot; mystery books are published as though they were written by Carolyn Keene, &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot; books are published as the work of Franklin W. Dixon, and &quot;The Bobbsey Twins&quot; series are credited to Laura Lee Hope, although numerous authors have been involved in each series. Erin Hunter, the author of the &quot;Warriors&quot; novel series, is a collective pen name used by authors Kate Cary, Cherith Baldry, Tui T. Sutherland, and the editor Victoria Holmes.

Collaborative authors may also have their works published under a single pen name. Frederic Dannay and Manfred B. Lee published their mystery novels and stories under the pen name Ellery Queen, which was also used to publish the work of several ghostwriters they commissioned. The writers of &quot;Atlanta Nights&quot;, a deliberately bad book intended to embarrass the publishing firm PublishAmerica, used the pen name Travis Tea. Additionally, the credited author of &quot;The Expanse&quot;, James S. A. Corey, is an amalgam of the middle names of collaborating writers Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck respectively, while S. A. is the initials of Abraham&#x27;s daughter. Sometimes multiple authors will write related books under the same pseudonym; examples include T. H. Lain in fiction. The Australian fiction collaborators who write under the pen name Alice Campion are a group of women who have so far written &quot;The Painted Sky&quot; (2015) and &quot;The Shifting Light&quot; (2017).

In the 1780s, &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot; were written under the pseudonym &quot;Publius&quot; by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay. The three men chose the name &quot;Publius&quot; because it recalled the founder of the Roman Republic and using it implied a positive intention.

In pure mathematics, Nicolas Bourbaki is the pseudonym of a group of mostly French-connected mathematicians attempting to expose the field in an axiomatic and self-contained, encyclopedic form.

===Concealment of identity===
A pseudonym may be used to protect the writer of exposé books about espionage or crime. Former SAS soldier Steven Billy Mitchell used the pseudonym Andy McNab for his book about a failed SAS mission titled &quot;Bravo Two Zero&quot;. The name Ibn Warraq (&quot;son of a papermaker&quot;) has been used by dissident Muslim authors. Author Brian O&#x27;Nolan used the pen names Flann O&#x27;Brien and Myles na gCopaleen for his novels and journalistic writing from the 1940s to the 1960s because Irish civil servants were not permitted at that time to publish political writings. The identity of the enigmatic twentieth-century novelist B. Traven has never been conclusively revealed, despite thorough research.

A multiple-use name or anonymity pseudonym is a pseudonym open for anyone to use and these have been adopted by various groups, often as a protest against the cult of individual creators. In Italy, two anonymous groups of writers have gained some popularity with the collective names of Luther Blissett and Wu Ming.

==Eastern literature==

===Hong Kong===
Wuxia novelist Louis Cha uses the pen name Gum Yoong (金庸) by taking apart the components of the Chinese character in his given name (鏞) from his birth name &quot;Cha Leung-yung&quot; (查良鏞).

===India===

In Indian languages, writers may put a pen name at the end of their names, like Ramdhari Singh Dinkar. Some writers, like Firaq Gorakhpuri, wrote only under a pen name.

In early Indian literature, authors considered the use of names egotistical. Because names were avoided, it is difficult to trace the authorship of many earlier literary works from India. Later writers adopted the practice of using the name of their deity of worship or Guru&#x27;s name as their pen name. In this case, typically the pen name would be included at the end of the prose or poetry.

Composers of Indian classical music used pen names in compositions to assert authorship, including Sadarang, Gunarang (Fayyaz Ahmed Khan), Ada Rang (court musician of Muhammad Shah), Sabrang (Bade Ghulam Ali Khan), and Ramrang (Ramashreya Jha). Other compositions are apocryphally ascribed to composers with their pen names.

===Japan===
Japanese poets who write haiku often use a &quot;haigō&quot; (俳号). The haiku poet Matsuo Bashō had used two other haigō before he became fond of a banana plant (&quot;bashō&quot;) that had been given to him by a disciple and started using it as his pen name at the age of 36.

Similar to a pen name, Japanese artists usually have a &quot;gō&quot; or art-name, which might change a number of times during their career. In some cases, artists adopted different &quot;gō&quot; at different stages of their career, usually to mark significant changes in their life. One of the most extreme examples of this is Hokusai, who in the period 1798 to 1806 alone used no fewer than six. Manga artist Ogure Ito uses the pen name Oh! great because his real name Ogure Ito is roughly how the Japanese pronounce &quot;oh great&quot;.

===Korea===
===Persian and Urdu poetry===

:&quot;Note: List of Urdu language poets provides pen names for a range of Urdu poets.&quot;
A &quot;shâ&#x27;er&quot; (Persian from Arabic, for poet) (a poet who writes &quot;she&#x27;rs&quot; in Urdu or Persian) almost always has a &quot;takhallus&quot;, a pen name, traditionally placed at the end of the name (often marked by a graphical sign placed above it) when referring to the poet by his full name. For example, Hafez is a pen-name for &quot;Shams al-Din&quot;, and thus the usual way to refer to him would be &quot;Shams al-Din Hafez&quot; or just &quot;Hafez&quot;. &quot;Mirza Asadullah Baig Khan&quot; (his official name and title) is referred to as &quot;Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib&quot;, or just &quot;Mirza Ghalib&quot;.

<text>Political or comparative economy is a branch of political science and economics studying economic systems (e.g. markets and national economies) and their governance by political systems (e.g. law, institutions, and government). Widely-studied phenomena within the discipline are systems such as labour and financial markets, as well as phenomena such as growth, distribution, inequality, and trade, and how these are shaped by institutions, laws, and government policy. Originating in the 18th century, it is the precursor to the modern discipline of economics. Political economy in its modern form is considered an interdisciplinary field, drawing on theory from both political science and modern economics.

Political economy originated within 16th century western moral philosophy, with theoretical works exploring the administration of states&#x27; wealth; &quot;political&quot; signifying the Greek word &quot;polity&quot; and &quot;economy&quot; signifying the Greek word ; household management. The earliest works of political economy are usually attributed to the British scholars Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, and David Ricardo, although they were preceded by the work of the French physiocrats, such as François Quesnay, Richard Cantillon and Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot. 

In the late 19th century, the term &quot;economics&quot; gradually began to replace the term &quot;political economy&quot; with the rise of mathematical modeling coinciding with the publication of the influential textbook &quot;Principles of Economics&quot; by Alfred Marshall in 1890. Earlier, William Stanley Jevons, a proponent of mathematical methods applied to the subject, advocated &quot;economics&quot; for brevity and with the hope of the term becoming &quot;the recognised name of a science&quot;. Citation measurement metrics from Google Ngram Viewer indicate that use of the term &quot;economics&quot; began to overshadow &quot;political economy&quot; around roughly 1910, becoming the preferred term for the discipline by 1920. Today, the term &quot;economics&quot; usually refers to the narrow study of the economy absent other political and social considerations while the term &quot;political economy&quot; represents a distinct and competing approach.

==Etymology==
Originally, political economy meant the study of the conditions under which production or consumption within limited parameters was organized in nation-states. In that way, political economy expanded the emphasis on economics, which comes from the Greek &quot;oikos&quot; (meaning &quot;home&quot;) and &quot;nomos&quot; (meaning &quot;law&quot; or &quot;order&quot;). Political economy was thus meant to express the laws of production of wealth at the state level, quite like economics concerns putting home to order. The phrase &quot;économie politique&quot; (translated in English to &quot;political economy&quot;) first appeared in France in 1615 with the well-known book by Antoine de Montchrétien, &quot;Traité de l&#x27;economie politique&quot;. Other contemporary scholars attribute the roots of this study to the 13th Century Tunisian Arab Historian and Sociologist, Ibn Khaldun, for his work on making the distinction between &quot;profit&quot; and &quot;sustenance&quot;, in modern political economy terms, surplus and that required for the reproduction of classes respectively. He also calls for the creation of a science to explain society and goes on to outline these ideas in his major work, the &quot;Muqaddimah&quot;. In Al-Muqaddimah Khaldun states, &quot;Civilization and its well-being, as well as business prosperity, depend on productivity and people&#x27;s efforts in all directions in their own interest and profit&quot; – seen as a modern precursor to Classical Economic thought.

Leading on from this, the French physiocrats were the first major exponents of political economy, although the intellectual responses of Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, David Ricardo, Henry George and Karl Marx to the physiocrats generally receive much greater attention. The world&#x27;s first professorship in political economy was established in 1754 at the University of Naples Federico II in southern Italy. The Neapolitan philosopher Antonio Genovesi was the first tenured professor. In 1763, Joseph von Sonnenfels was appointed a Political Economy chair at the University of Vienna, Austria. Thomas Malthus, in 1805, became England&#x27;s first professor of political economy, at the East India Company College, Haileybury, Hertfordshire. At present, political economy refers to different yet related approaches to studying economic and related behaviours, ranging from the combination of economics with other fields to the use of different, fundamental assumptions challenging earlier economic assumptions.

==Current approaches==

Political economy most commonly refers to interdisciplinary studies drawing upon economics, sociology and political science in explaining how political institutions, the political environment, and the economic system—capitalist, socialist, communist, or mixed—influence each other. The &quot;Journal of Economic Literature&quot; classification codes associate political economy with three sub-areas: (1) the role of government and/or class and power relationships in resource allocation for each type of economic system; (2) international political economy, which studies the economic impacts of international relations; and (3) economic models of political or exploitative class processes. Within the field of political science, there is generally a distinction between international political economy (studied by international relations scholars) and comparative political economy (studied by comparative politics scholars).

Public choice theory is a microfoundations theory closely intertwined with political economy. Both approaches model voters, politicians and bureaucrats as behaving in mainly self-interested ways, in contrast to a view, ascribed to earlier mainstream economists, of government officials trying to maximize individual utilities from some kind of social welfare function. As such, economists and political scientists often associate political economy with approaches using rational-choice assumptions, especially in game theory and in examining phenomena beyond economics&#x27; standard remit, such as government failure and complex decision making in which context the term &quot;positive political economy&quot; is common. Other &quot;traditional&quot; topics include analysis of such public policy issues as economic regulation, monopoly, rent-seeking, market protection, institutional corruption and distributional politics. Empirical analysis includes the influence of elections on the choice of economic policy, determinants and forecasting models of electoral outcomes, the political business cycles, central-bank independence and the politics of excessive deficits. An interesting example would be the publication in 1954 of the first manual of Political Economy in the Soviet Union, edited by Lev Gatovsky, which mixed the classic theoretical approach of the time with the soviet political discourse.
A rather recent focus has been put on modeling economic policy and political institutions concerning interactions between agents and economic and political institutions, including the seeming discrepancy of economic policy and economist&#x27;s recommendations through the lens of transaction costs. From the mid-1990s, the field has expanded, in part aided by new cross-national data sets allowing tests of hypotheses on comparative economic systems and institutions. Topics have included the breakup of nations, the origins and rate of change of political institutions in relation to economic growth, development, financial markets and regulation, the importance of institutions, backwardness, reform and transition economies, the role of culture, ethnicity and gender in explaining economic outcomes, macroeconomic policy, the environment, fairness and the relation of constitutions to economic policy, theoretical and empirical.

Other important landmarks in the development of political economy include:
* New political economy which may treat economic ideologies as the phenomenon to explain, per the traditions of Marxian political economy. Thus, Charles S. Maier suggests that a political economy approach &quot;interrogates economic doctrines to disclose their sociological and political premises... in sum, [it] regards economic ideas and behavior not as frameworks for analysis, but as beliefs and actions that must themselves be explained&quot;. This approach informs Andrew Gamble&#x27;s &quot;The Free Economy and the Strong State&quot; (Palgrave Macmillan, 1988), and Colin Hay&#x27;s &quot;The Political Economy of New Labour&quot; (Manchester University Press, 1999). It also informs much work published in &quot;New Political Economy&quot;, an international journal founded by Sheffield University scholars in 1996.
* International political economy (IPE) an interdisciplinary field comprising approaches to the actions of various actors. According to International Relations scholar Chris Brown, University of Warwick professor, Susan Strange, was &quot;almost single-handedly responsible for creating international political economy as a field of study.&quot; In the United States, these approaches are associated with the journal &quot;International Organization&quot;, which in the 1970s became the leading journal of IPE under the editorship of Robert Keohane, Peter J. Katzenstein and Stephen Krasner. They are also associated with the journal &quot;The Review of International Political Economy&quot;. There also is a more critical school of IPE, inspired by thinkers such as Antonio Gramsci and Karl Polanyi; two major figures are Matthew Watson and Robert W. Cox.
* The use of a political economy approach by anthropologists, sociologists, and geographers used in reference to the regimes of politics or economic values that emerge primarily at the level of states or regional governance, but also within smaller social groups and social networks. Because these regimes influence and are influenced by the organization of both social and economic capital, the analysis of dimensions lacking a standard economic value (e.g. the political economy of language, of gender, or of religion) often draws on concepts used in Marxian critiques of capital. Such approaches expand on neo-Marxian scholarship related to development and underdevelopment postulated by André Gunder Frank and Immanuel Wallerstein.
* Historians have employed political economy to explore the ways in the past that persons and groups with common economic interests have used politics to effect changes beneficial to their interests.
* Political economy and law is a recent attempt within legal scholarship to engage explicitly with political economy literature. In the 1920s and 1930s, legal realists (e.g. Robert Hale) and intellectuals (e.g. John Commons) engaged themes related to political economy. In the second half of the 20th century, lawyers associated with the Chicago School incorporated certain intellectual traditions from economics. However, since the crisis in 2007 legal scholars especially related to international law, have turned to more explicitly engage with the debates, methodology and various themes within political economy texts.
* Thomas Piketty&#x27;s approach and call to action which advocated for the re-introduction of political consideration and political science knowledge more generally into the discipline of economics as a way of improving the robustness of the discipline and remedying its shortcomings, which had become clear following the 2008 financial crisis.
* In 2010, the only Department of Political Economy in the United Kingdom formally established at King&#x27;s College London. The rationale for this academic unit was that &quot;the disciplines of Politics and Economics are inextricably linked&quot;, and that it was &quot;not possible to properly understand political processes without exploring the economic context in which politics operates&quot;.
* In 2012, the Sheffield Political Economy Research Institute (SPERI) was founded at The University of Sheffield by professors Tony Payne and Colin Hay. It was created as a means of combining political and economic analyses of capitalism which were viewed by the founders to be insufficient as independent disciplines in explaining the 2008 financial crisis. 
* In 2017, the Political Economy UK Group (abbreviated PolEconUK) was established as a research consortium in the field of political economy. It hosts an annual conference and counts among its member institutions Oxford, Cambridge, King&#x27;s College London, Warwick University and the London School of Economics.

==Related disciplines==
Because political economy is not a unified discipline, there are studies using the term that overlap in subject matter, but have radically different perspectives:
* Politics studies power relations and their relationship to achieving desired ends.
* Philosophy rigorously assesses and studies a set of beliefs and their applicability to reality.
* Economics studies the distribution of resources so that the material wants of a society are satisfied; enhance societal well-being.
* Sociology studies the effects of persons&#x27; involvement in society as members of groups and how that changes their ability to function. Many sociologists start from a perspective of production-determining relation from Karl Marx. Marx&#x27;s theories on the subject of political economy are contained in his book .
* Anthropology studies political economy by investigating regimes of political and economic value that condition tacit aspects of sociocultural practices (e.g. the pejorative use of pseudo-Spanish expressions in the U.S. entertainment media) by means of broader historical, political and sociological processes. Analyses of structural features of transnational processes focus on the interactions between the world capitalist system and local cultures.
* Archaeology attempts to reconstruct past political economies by examining the material evidence for administrative strategies to control and mobilize resources. This evidence may include architecture, animal remains, evidence for craft workshops, evidence for feasting and ritual, evidence for the import or export of prestige goods, or evidence for food storage.
* Psychology is the fulcrum on which political economy exerts its force in studying decision making (not only in prices), but as the field of study whose assumptions model political economy.
* Geography studies political economy within the wider geographical studies of human-environment interactions wherein economic actions of humans transform the natural environment. Apart from these, attempts have been made to develop a geographical political economy that prioritises commodity production and &quot;spatialities&quot; of capitalism.
* History documents change, often using it to argue political economy; some historical works take political economy as the narrative&#x27;s frame.
* Ecology deals with political economy because human activity has the greatest effect upon the environment, its central concern being the environment&#x27;s suitability for human activity. The ecological effects of economic activity spur research upon changing market economy incentives. Additionally and more recently, ecological theory has been used to examine economic systems as similar systems of interacting species (e.g., firms).
* Cultural studies examines social class, production, labor, race, gender and sex.
* Communications examines the institutional aspects of media and telecommunication systems. As the area of study focusing on aspects of human communication, it pays particular attention to the relationships between owners, labor, consumers, advertisers, structures of production and the state and the power relationships embedded in these relationships.

<text>Psychedelia usually refers to a style or aesthetic that is resembled in the psychedelic subculture of the 1960s and the psychedelic experience produced by certain psychoactive substances. This includes psychedelic art, psychedelic music and style of dress during that era. This was primarily generated by people who used psychedelic drugs such as LSD, mescaline (found in peyote) and psilocybin (found in magic mushrooms) and also non-users who were participants and aficionados of this subculture. Psychedelic art and music typically recreate or reflect the experience of altered consciousness. Psychedelic art uses highly distorted, surreal visuals, bright colors and full spectrums and animation (including cartoons) to evoke, convey, or enhance the psychedelic experience.

Psychedelic music uses distorted electric guitar, Indian music elements such as the sitar, tabla, electronic effects, sound effects and reverb, and elaborate studio effects, such as playing tapes backwards or panning the music from one side to another.

A psychedelic experience is characterized by the striking perception of aspects of one&#x27;s mind previously unknown, or by the creative exuberance of the mind liberated from its ostensibly ordinary fetters. Psychedelic states are an array of experiences including changes of perception such as hallucinations, synesthesia, altered states of awareness or focused consciousness, variation in thought patterns, trance or hypnotic states, mystical states, and other mind alterations.

These processes can lead some people to experience changes in mental operation defining their self-identity (whether in momentary acuity or chronic development) different enough from their previous normal state that it can excite feelings of newly formed understanding such as revelation, illumination, confusion, and psychosis. Individuals who use psychedelic drugs for spiritual purposes or self-discovery are commonly referred to as &quot;psychonauts&quot;.

==Etymology==

The term was first coined as a noun in 1956 by psychiatrist Humphry Osmond as an alternative descriptor for hallucinogenic drugs in the context of psychedelic psychotherapy. It is irregularly derived from the Greek words ψυχή &quot;psychḗ&quot; &#x27;soul, mind&#x27; and δηλείν &quot;dēleín&quot; &#x27;to manifest&#x27;, with the meaning &quot;mind manifesting,&quot; the implication being that psychedelics can develop unused potentials of the human mind. The term was loathed by American ethnobotanist Richard Schultes but championed by American psychologist Timothy Leary.

Seeking a name for the experience induced by LSD, Osmond contacted Aldous Huxley, a personal acquaintance and advocate for the therapeutic use of the substance. Huxley coined the term &quot;phanerothyme,&quot; from the Greek terms for &quot;manifest&quot; (φανερός) and &quot;spirit&quot; (θύμος). In a letter to Osmond, he wrote: 
To which Osmond responded:
It was on this term that Osmond eventually settled, because it was &quot;clear, euphonious and uncontaminated by other associations.&quot; This mongrel spelling of the word &#x27;psychedelic&#x27; was loathed by American ethnobotanist Richard Evans Schultes, but championed by Timothy Leary, who thought it sounded better. Due to the expanded use of the term &quot;psychedelic&quot; in pop culture and a perceived incorrect verbal formulation, Carl A.P. Ruck, Jeremy Bigwood, Danny Staples, Jonathan Ott, and R. Gordon Wasson proposed the term &quot;entheogen&quot; to describe the religious or spiritual experience produced by such substances.

==History==
From the second half of the 1950s, Beat Generation writers like William Burroughs, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg wrote about and took drugs, including cannabis and Benzedrine, raising awareness and helping to popularise their use. In the same period Lysergic acid diethylamide, better known as LSD, or &quot;acid&quot; (at the time a legal drug), began to be used in the US and UK as an experimental treatment, initially promoted as a potential cure for mental illness.

In the early 1960s, the use of LSD and other hallucinogens was advocated by proponents of the new &quot;consciousness expansion&quot;, such as Timothy Leary, Alan Watts, Aldous Huxley and Arthur Koestler, their writings profoundly influenced the thinking of the new generation of youth. There had long been a culture of drug use among jazz and blues musicians, and use of drugs (including cannabis, peyote, mescaline and LSD) had begun to grow among folk and rock musicians, who also began to include drug references in their songs. In the UK rock scene, some notable users were groups such as the Rolling Stones, the Beatles and the Moody Blues.

By the mid-1960s, the psychedelic life-style had already developed in California, and an entire subculture developed. This was particularly true in San Francisco, due in part to the first major underground LSD factory, established there by Owsley Stanley. There was also an emerging music scene of folk clubs, coffee houses and independent radio stations catering to a population of students at nearby Berkeley, and to free thinkers that had gravitated to the city.

From 1964, the Merry Pranksters, a loose group that developed around novelist Ken Kesey, sponsored the Acid Tests, a series of events based around the taking of LSD (supplied by Stanley), accompanied by light shows, film projection and discordant, improvised music known as the &quot;psychedelic symphony&quot;. The Pranksters helped popularize LSD use through their road trips across America in a psychedelically decorated school bus, which involved distributing the drug and meeting with major figures of the beat movement, and through publications about their activities such as Tom Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; (1968).

Leary was a well-known proponent of the use of psychedelics, as was Aldous Huxley. However, both advanced widely different opinions on the broad use of psychedelics by state and civil society. Leary promulgated the idea of such substances as a panacea, while Huxley suggested that only the cultural and intellectual elite should partake of entheogens systematically.

In the 1960s, the use of psychedelic drugs became widespread in modern Western culture, particularly in the United States and Britain. The movement is credited to Michael Hollingshead who arrived in America from London in 1965. He was sent to the U.S. by other members of the psychedelic movement to get their ideas exposure. The Summer of Love of 1967 and the resultant popularization of the hippie culture to the mainstream popularized psychedelia in the minds of popular culture, where it remained dominant through the 1970s.

==Modern usage==

The impact of psychedelic drugs on western culture in the 1960s led to semantic drift in the use of the word &quot;psychedelic&quot;, and it is now frequently used to describe anything with abstract decoration of multiple bright colours, similar to those seen in drug-induced hallucinations. In objection to this new meaning, and to what some consider pejorative meanings of other synonyms such as &quot;hallucinogen&quot; and &quot;psychotomimetic&quot;, the term &quot;entheogen&quot; was proposed and is seeing increasing use. However, many consider the term &quot;entheogen&quot; best reserved for religious and spiritual usage, such as certain Native American churches do with the peyote sacrament, and &quot;psychedelic&quot; left to describe those who are using these drugs for recreation, psychotherapy, physical healing, or creative problem solving. In science, hallucinogen remains the standard term.

==Visual art==

Advances in printing and photographic technology in the 1960s saw the traditional lithography printing techniques rapidly superseded by the offset printing system. This and other technical and industrial innovations gave young artists access to exciting new graphic techniques and media, including photographic and mixed media collage, metallic foils, and vivid new fluorescent &quot;DayGlo&quot; inks. This enabled them to explore innovative new illustrative styles including highly distorted visuals, cartoons, and lurid colors and full spectrums to evoke a sense of altered consciousness; many works also featured idiosyncratic and complex new fonts and lettering styles (most notably in the work of San Francisco-based poster artist Rick Griffin). Many artists in the late 1960s and early 1970s attempted to illustrate the psychedelic experience in paintings, drawings, illustrations, and other forms of graphic design.

The counterculture music scene frequently used psychedelic designs on posters during the Summer of Love, leading to a popularization of the style. The most productive and influential centre of psychedelic art in the late 1960s was San Francisco; a scene driven in large measure by the patronage of the popular local music venues of the day like the Avalon Ballroom and Bill Graham&#x27;s Fillmore West, which regularly commissioned young local artists like Robert Crumb, Stanley Mouse, Rick Griffin and others. They produced a wealth of distinctive psychedelic promotional posters and handbills for concerts that featured emerging psychedelic bands like Big Brother and the Holding Company, The Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane. Many of these works are now regarded as classics of the poster genre, and original items by these artists command high prices on the collector market today.

Contemporary with the burgeoning San Francisco scene, a smaller but equally creative psychedelic art movement emerged in London, led by expatriate Australian pop artist Martin Sharp, who created many striking psychedelic posters and illustrations for the influential underground publication Oz magazine, as well as the famous album covers for the Cream albums &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; and &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot;.

Other prominent London practitioners of the style included: design duo Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, whose work included numerous famous posters, as well as psychedelic &quot;makeovers&quot; on a piano for Paul McCartney and a car for doomed Guinness heir Tara Browne, and design collective The Fool, who created clothes and album art for several leading UK bands including The Beatles, Cream, and The Move. The Beatles loved psychedelic designs on their albums, and designer group called The Fool created psychedelic design, art, paint at the short-lived Apple Boutique (1967–1968) in Baker St, London.

Blues rock singer Janis Joplin had a psychedelic car, a Porsche 356. The trend also extended to motor vehicles. The earliest, and perhaps most famous of all psychedelic vehicles was the famous &quot;Further&quot; bus, driven by Ken Kesey and The Merry Pranksters, which was painted inside and out in 1964 with bold psychedelic designs (although these were executed in primary colours, since the DayGlo colours that soon became &quot;de rigueur&quot; were then not widely available). Another very famous example is John Lennon&#x27;s psychedelic Rolls-Royce – originally black, he had it repainted in 1967 in a vivid psychedelic gypsy caravan style, prompting bandmate George Harrison to have his Mini Cooper similarly repainted with logos and devices that reflected his burgeoning interest in Indian spirituality.

== Psychedelia design ==
The Psychedelia movement in the 1960s had a large impact on graphic design and architecture during the movement. During this time period, it was all about taking creative risks. This movement was experimental and colorful. There was a political unrest because of Black and Indigenous groups trying to get their rights. With African Americans, it was the civil rights movement. Michael Parke-Taylor includes Native Americans in the conversation. For Indigenous or Native Americans, they &quot;represented the perfect symbol of those marginalized and persecuted in contemporary American society.&quot;

Graphic design during this era was playful and colorful. This was because of the drug known as LSD. The Hippies took over the psychedelic designs. Jeffrey Meikle understood what the Hippies wanted to create. He knew that the &quot;Hippie artists energized American visual culture with rock concert posters, record jackets, extravagant, and underground newspapers.&quot; Milton Glaser has a poster design of Bob Dylan. The poster is colorful and playful. Glaser wanted to get away from the black and white designs of posters and trade that in for a more experimental design. These designs were usually hand painted and printed. The typography was the same as the poster which was playful and colorful. Juliana Duque mentions the typography was &quot;organic patterns, kaleidoscopic textures, and waving (nearly encrypted) lettering combined with intense colors.&quot;

There were a few architecture designs that came out during this period. The graphic design elements on buses were just as colorful as the posters. They employed psychedelic elements to craft immersive environments and foster an interactive space. Luke Dickens explores the overlooked architecture in the 1960s. He mentions The Fifth Dimension as being &quot;highly inventive, utopian “fun palace” used advanced modular technologies... and deployed psychedelic sensibilities as a novel form of disruptive politics to induce critical dispositions towards the built environment.&quot; The theme of bright colors was evident in this fiber glass domed-shaped building. This building was meant to trigger psychedelic responses. Similar to The Fifth Dimension, there was a geodesic dome and a dymaxion car made by Buckminster Fuller. The geodesic dome was complex. Meikle explained that Fuller followed the psychedelia era by wanting to speak &quot;to a counterculture claiming to reject American Materialism.&quot;

==Music==
The fashion for psychedelic drugs gave its name to the style of psychedelia, a term describing a category of rock music known as psychedelic rock, as well as visual art, fashion, and culture that is associated originally with the high 1960s, hippies, and the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco, California. It often used new recording techniques and effects while drawing on Eastern sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music.

One of the first uses of the word in the music scene of this time was in the 1964 recording of &quot;Hesitation Blues&quot; by folk group the Holy Modal Rounders. The term was introduced to rock music and popularized by the 13th Floor Elevators 1966 album &quot;The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators&quot;. Psychedelia truly took off in 1967 with the Summer of Love and, although associated with San Francisco, the style soon spread across the US, and worldwide.

The electronic dance music scene is strongly linked to the consumption of psychedelic drugs, particularly MDMA. Drug usage in the EDM scene can primarily be traced to British acid house parties and the Second Summer of Love, which marked the beginnings of rave culture; these movements, however, were distinct from and mostly unrelated to 1960s psychedelia.

==Festivals==
A psychedelic festival is a gathering that promotes psychedelic music and art in an effort to unite participants in a communal psychedelic experience. Psychedelic festivals have been described as &quot;temporary communities reproduced via personal and collective acts of transgression... through the routine expenditure of excess energy, and through self-sacrifice in acts of abandonment involving ecstatic dancing often fueled by chemical cocktails.&quot; These festivals often emphasize the ideals of peace, love, unity, and respect. Notable psychedelic festivals include the biennial Boom Festival in Portugal, Ozora Festival in Hungary, Universo Paralello in Brazil as well as Nevada&#x27;s Burning Man and California&#x27;s Symbiosis Gathering in the United States.

==Conferences==
In recent years there has been a resurgence in interest in psychedelic research and a growing number of conferences now take place across the globe. The psychedelic research charity Breaking Convention have hosted one of the world&#x27;s largest since 2011. A biennial conference in London, UK, Breaking Convention: a multidisciplinary conference on psychedelic consciousness is a multidisciplinary conference on psychedelic consciousness. In the US MAPS held their first Psychedelic Science conference, devoted specifically to research of psychedelics in scientific and medical fields, in 2013. In Australia, Entheogenesis Australis has been hosting the world&#x27;s longest ongoing conferences around psychedelics and ethnobotany since 2004.

<text>Pope Evaristus (Greek: Ευάριστος) was the bishop of Rome from 99/100 to his death in 107/108. He was also known as Aristus and is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Catholic Church, and Oriental Orthodoxy. It is likely that John the Apostle died during his reign period, marking the end of the Apostolic Age.

==Biography==

According to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, he was a Greek by birth, fathered by a Greek Jew named Judah from the city of Bethlehem. Eusebius, in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, states that Evaristus took office in the 3rd year of Trajan&#x27;s reign, which correspond to AD 99/100, and died in the 12th year of the same reign (AD 108/109) after holding the office for nine years. He divided titles among the priests in the city of Rome, and ordained seven deacons to assist with the bishop&#x27;s preaching.

According to Reverend John F. Sullivan, Evaristus decreed that “in accordance with Apostolic tradition marriage should be celebrated publicly and with the blessing of the priest”. Liber Pontificalis further describes him as the one &quot;crowned with martyrdom&quot;. The same is indicated also by French historian Alexis-François Artaud de Montor. However, in the Roman Martyrology he is listed without the martyr title, with a feast day on 26 October.

Pope Evaristus is buried near the body of Saint Peter in the Vatican, in Saint Peter&#x27;s tomb under Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

<doc id="46049" wikidata="Q1475236" url="?curid=46049" title="Smoke testing (mechanical)">
<text>Smoke testing refers to various classes of tests of systems, usually intended to determine whether they are ready for more robust testing. The expression probably was first used in plumbing in referring to tests for the detection of cracks, leaks or breaks in closed systems of pipes.

Pre-dating the term itself, smoke tests were performed to detect leaks in wooden sailing vessels at least as early as 1836. After making a slow fire in the bottom of the hold, Richard Henry Dana writes, &quot;Wherever smoke was seen coming out we calked and pasted and, so far as we could, make the ship smoke tight.&quot;

== History of the term ==

The plumbing industry started using the smoke test in 1875.

== Smoke testing in various industries ==

=== Plumbing ===
In plumbing a smoke test forces non-toxic, artificially created smoke through waste and drain pipes under a slight pressure to find leaks. Plumes of smoke form where there are defects. This test can be performed when the plumbing is brand new, but more often it is used to find sewer gas leaks that may plague a building or an area. Any sign of smoke escaping can be considered a possible site for sewer gas to escape. Sewer gas typically has a rotten egg smell and can contain methane gas, which is explosive, or hydrogen sulfide gas, which is deadly.

Plumbing smoke tests are also used to find places where pipes will spill fluid, and to check sanitary sewer systems for places where ground water and storm runoff can enter. Smoke testing is particularly useful in places such as ventilated sanitary sewer systems, where completely sealing the system is not practical.

When smoke testing a sanitary sewer system it is helpful to partially block off the section of sewer to be tested. This can be done by using a sand bag on the end of a rope. The sand bag is lowered into the manhole and swung into position to partially block lines. Completely blocking the line can cause water to back up and prevent smoke from escaping through defects. Smoke testing may not be done after rain or when ground water is unusually high as this may also prevent detection of defects.

Large downdraft fans, usually powered by gasoline engines, are placed on top of open manholes at either end of the section to be tested. If possible all lines in the manholes except for the line between the manholes are partially blocked. Smoke is created using either a smoke bomb or liquid smoke. Smoke bombs are lit and placed on a grate or in a holder on top of each fan, while liquid smoke is injected into the fan via a heating chamber. The fans create a pressure differential that forces the smoke into the sewer at a pressure just above atmospheric. With properly installed plumbing, the traps will prevent the smoke from entering the house and redirect it out the plumbing vents. Defective plumbing systems or dry traps will allow smoke to enter the inside of the house.

The area around the section being tested is searched for smoke plumes. Plumes coming from plumbing vents or the interface between the fan shroud and manhole rim are normal; however, smoke plumes outside of the manhole rim are not. Plumes are marked, usually with flags, and defects are noted using measurements from stationary landmarks like the corners of houses. The plumes or markers may also be photographed.

=== Woodwind instrument repair ===
In woodwind instrument repair, a smoke test involved plugging one end of an instrument and blowing tobacco smoke from the tester&#x27;s mouth into the other to test for leaks. Escaping smoke revealed improperly seated pads and faulty joints (i.e. leaks). After this test the instrument was cleaned to remove nicotine and other deposits left by the smoke.

Described in a repair manual written in the 1930s, smoke testing is considered obsolete, and is no longer used by reputable technicians. The usual alternative to smoke is to place a bright light inside the instrument then check for light appearing around pads and joints.

=== Automotive repair ===
In the same way that plumbing and woodwind instruments are tested, the vacuum systems of automobiles may be tested in order to locate difficult-to-find vacuum leaks. Artificial smoke is deliberately introduced into the system under slight pressure and any leaks are indicated by the escaping smoke. Smoke can also be used to locate difficult-to-find leaks in the fuel evaporative emissions control (EVAP) system.

=== Infectious disease control ===

In infectious disease control a smoke test is done to see whether a room is under negative pressure. A tube containing smoke is held near the bottom of the negative pressure room door, about two inches in front of the door. The smoke tube is held parallel to the door, and a small amount of smoke is then generated by gently squeezing the bulb. Care is taken to release the smoke from the tube slowly to ensure the velocity of the smoke from the tube does not overpower the air velocity. If the room is at negative pressure, the smoke will travel under the door and into the room. If the room is not at negative pressure, the smoke will be blown outward or will stay stationary.

<doc id="46052" wikidata="Q104049" url="?curid=46052" title="Sidney Poitier">
<text>Sidney Poitier ( ; February 20, 1927 – January 6, 2022) was a Bahamian-American actor, film director, activist, and diplomat. In 1964, he was the first black actor and first Bahamian to win the Academy Award for Best Actor. He received two competitive Golden Globe Awards, a BAFTA Award, and a Grammy Award as well as nominations for two Emmy Awards and a Tony Award. In 1999, he was ranked among the &quot;American Film Institute&#x27;s 100 Stars&quot;. Poitier was one of the last surviving stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood cinema.

Poitier&#x27;s family lived in the Bahamas, then still a Crown colony, but he was born in Miami, Florida, while they were visiting, which automatically granted him U.S. citizenship. He grew up in the Bahamas, but moved to Miami at age 15, and to New York City when he was 16. He joined the American Negro Theatre, landing his breakthrough film role as a high school student in the film &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; (1955). Poitier gained stardom for his leading roles in films such as &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot; (1958) for which he made history becoming the first African American to receive an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination. Additionally Poitier won the Silver Bear for Best Actor for that performance. In 1964, he won the Academy Award and the Golden Globe for Best Actor for &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot; (1963).

Poitier broke ground playing strong leading African American male roles in films such as &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; (1959), &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot; (1961), and &quot;A Patch of Blue&quot; (1965). He acted in three films in 1967, films which tackled race and race relations: &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot;; &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot;, and &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, the latter of which earned him Golden Globe and BAFTA Award nominations. In a poll the next year he was voted the US&#x27;s top box-office star. Poitier made his directorial film debut with &quot;Buck and the Preacher&quot; (1972) followed by &quot;A Warm December&quot; (1973), &quot;Uptown Saturday Night&quot; (1974), and &quot;Stir Crazy&quot; (1980). He later starred in &quot;Shoot to Kill&quot; (1988) and &quot;Sneakers&quot; (1992).

Poitier was granted an honorary knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II in 1974. He received numerous honors including the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1982, the Kennedy Center Honor in 1995, Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award in 1999, and the Honorary Academy Award in 2002. In 2009, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama. In 2016, he was awarded the BAFTA Fellowship for outstanding lifetime achievement in film. From 1997 to 2007, he was the Bahamian Ambassador to Japan.

==Early life==
Sidney Poitier was born on February 20, 1927, in Miami, Florida. He was the youngest of seven children born to Evelyn () and Reginald James Poitier, Afro-Bahamian farmers who owned a farm on Cat Island. The family would travel to Miami to sell tomatoes and other produce to wholesalers. His father also worked as a cab driver in Nassau. Poitier was born unexpectedly in Miami while his parents were there on business; his birth was two months premature, and he was not expected to survive, but his parents remained in Miami for three months to nurse him to health. Poitier grew up in the Bahamas, then a British Crown colony. His birth in the United States entitled him to US citizenship.

Although there were few Poitiers of French ancestry in the Bahamas, some believe that the Poitier ancestors had migrated from Haiti, and were probably among the runaway slaves who established maroon communities throughout the Bahamas, including Cat Island. There had, however, been one Poitier of French ancestry on Cat Island, planter Charles Leonard Poitier, who had immigrated from Jamaica in the early 1800s, possibly originally from Haiti. In 1834, following the abolition of slavery, 86 slaves from his wife&#x27;s estate kept the Poitier name.

Poitier lived with his family on Cat Island until he was ten, when they moved to Nassau. There he was exposed to the modern world, where he saw his first automobile and first experienced electricity, plumbing, refrigeration, and motion pictures. He was raised Catholic but later became an agnostic with views closer to deism.

At age fifteen, in 1942, he was sent to Miami to live with his brother&#x27;s large family, but Poitier found it impossible to adjust to the racism in Jim Crow era Florida. At sixteen, he moved to New York City, looking to become an actor, holding a string of jobs as a dishwasher in the meantime. After failing his first audition with the American Negro Theatre due to his inability to fluently read the script, an elderly Jewish waiter sat with him every night for several months, helping him to improve his reading by using the newspaper. During World War II, in November 1943, he lied about his age (he was only 16 at the time) and enlisted in the Army. He was assigned to a Veteran&#x27;s Administration hospital in Northport, New York, and was trained to work with psychiatric patients. Poitier became upset with how the hospital treated its patients and feigned mental illness to obtain a discharge. Poitier confessed to a psychiatrist that he was faking his condition, but the doctor was sympathetic and granted his discharge under Section VIII of Army regulation 615–360 in December 1944.

After leaving the Army, he worked as a dishwasher until a successful audition landed him a role in an American Negro Theatre production, the same company he failed his first audition with.

==Career==
===1947–1957: Early work and blacklist===
Poitier joined the American Negro Theater but was rejected by audiences. Contrary to what was expected of negro actors at the time, Poitier&#x27;s tone deafness made him unable to sing. Determined to refine his acting skills and rid himself of his noticeable Bahamian accent, he spent the next six months dedicating himself to achieving theatrical success. He modeled his legendary speech pattern after radio personality Norman Brokenshire. On his second attempt at the theater, he was noticed and given a leading role in the Broadway production of &quot;Lysistrata&quot;, through which, though it ran a failing four days, he received an invitation to understudy for &quot;Anna Lucasta&quot;. Poitier would later befriend Harry Belafonte at the American Negro Theater.

In 1947, Poitier was a founding member of the Committee for the Negro in the Arts (CNA), an organization whose participants were committed to a left-wing analysis of class and racial exploitation. Among his other CNA-related activities, in the early 1950s he was a Vice Chair of the organization. In 1952, he was one of several narrators in a pageant written by Alice Childress and Lorraine Hansberry for the Negro History Festival put on by the leftist Harlem monthly newspaper &quot;Freedom&quot;.

His participation in such events and CNA generally, along with his friendships with other leftist Black performers, including Canada Lee and Paul Robeson, led to his subsequent blacklisting for a few years. Even associating with Poitier added to the basis for blacklisting Alfred Palca, the writer and producer of one of Poitier&#x27;s earliest films, the 1954 &quot;Go Man Go&quot;. Poitier never did sign a loyalty oath, despite being asked in connection with his prospective role in &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; (1955).

By late 1949, Poitier had to choose between leading roles on stage and an offer to work for Darryl F. Zanuck in the film &quot;No Way Out&quot; (1950). His performance in &quot;No Way Out&quot;, as a doctor treating a white bigot (played by Richard Widmark, who became a friend), was noticed and led to more roles, each considerably more interesting and more prominent than those most African-American actors of the time were offered. In 1951, he traveled to South Africa with the African-American actor Canada Lee to star in the film version of &quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot;. Poitier&#x27;s distinction continued in his role as Gregory W. Miller, a member of an incorrigible high-school class in &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; (1955). But it was his performance in Martin Ritt&#x27;s 1957 film &quot;Edge of the City&quot; that the industry could not ignore. It was a pitch towards stardom granted him.

Poitier enjoyed working for director William Wellman on &quot;Good-bye, My Lady&quot; (1956). Wellman was a big name, he had previously directed the famous &quot;Roxie Hart&quot; (1942) with Ginger Rogers and &quot;Magic Town&quot; (1947) with James Stewart. What Poitier remembered indelibly was the wonderful humanity in this talented director. Wellman had a sensitivity that Poitier thought was profound, which Wellman felt he needed to hide.&quot; Poitier later praised Wellman for inspiring his thoughtful approach to directing when he found himself taking the helm from Joseph Sargent on &quot;Buck and the Preacher&quot; in 1971.

=== 1958–1969: Breakthrough and stardom ===
In 1958 he starred alongside Tony Curtis in director Stanley Kramer&#x27;s &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot;. The film was a critical and commercial success with the performances of both Poitier and Curtis being praised. The film landed eight Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and Best Actor nominations for both stars, making Poitier the first African-American actor to be nominated in a lead role. Poitier did win the British Academy Film Award for Best Foreign Actor.

Poitier acted in the first production of &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot; alongside Ruby Dee on the Broadway stage at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre in 1959. The play was directed by Lloyd Richards. The play introduced details of Black life to the overwhelmingly White Broadway audiences, while director Richards observed that it was the first play to which large numbers of Black people were drawn. The play was a groundbreaking piece of American theater with Frank Rich, critic from &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing in 1983, that &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot; &quot;changed American theater forever&quot;. For his performance he earned a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play nomination. That same year Poitier would star in the film adaptation of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; (1959) alongside Dorothy Dandridge. For his performance, Poitier received a 1960 Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.


In 1961, Poitier starred in the film adaptation of &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot; for which he received another Golden Globe Award nomination. Also in 1961, Poitier starred in &quot;Paris Blues&quot; alongside Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Louis Armstrong, and Diahann Carroll. The film dealt with the American racism of the time by contrasting it with Paris&#x27;s open acceptance of Black people. In 1963 he starred in &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot;. For this role, he won the Academy Award for Best Actor and became the first African-American to win the award in a leading role. His satisfaction at this honor was undermined by his concerns that this award was more of the industry congratulating itself for having him as a token and it would inhibit him from asking for more substantive considerations afterward. Poitier worked relatively little over the following year; he remained the only major actor of African descent and the roles offered were predominantly typecast as a soft-spoken appeaser.

In 1964, Poitier recorded an album with the composer Fred Katz called &quot;Poitier Meets Plato&quot;, in which Poitier recites passages from Plato&#x27;s writings. He also performed in the Cold War drama &quot;The Bedford Incident&quot; (1965) alongside the film&#x27;s producer Richard Widmark, the Biblical epic film &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965) alongside Charlton Heston and Max von Sydow, and &quot;A Patch of Blue&quot; (1965) co-starring Elizabeth Hartman and Shelley Winters.

In 1967, he was the most successful draw at the box office, the commercial peak of his career, with three popular films, &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot;, and &quot;In the Heat of the Night (film)&quot;, and &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot;. Although these three films seemingly shared little similarity, they all, albeit not overtly, dealt with the black and white divide. In &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot;, Poitier plays a teacher at a secondary school in the East End of London. The film deals with social and racial issues in the inner city school. The film was met with mixed response; however, Poitier was praised for his performance, with the critic from &quot;Time&quot; writing, &quot;Even the weak moments are saved by Poitier, who invests his role with a subtle warmth.&quot;

In Norman Jewison&#x27;s mystery drama &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, Poitier played Virgil Tibbs, a police detective from Philadelphia who investigates a murder in the Deep South in Mississippi alongside a cop with racial prejudices played by Rod Steiger. The film was a critical success with Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling it &quot;the most powerful film I have seen in a long time.&quot; Roger Ebert placed it at number ten on his top ten list of 1967 films. Art Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; felt that the excellent Poitier and outstanding Steiger performances overcame noteworthy flaws, including an uneven script. Poitier received a Golden Globe Award and British Academy Film Award nomination for his performance.

In Stanley Kramer&#x27;s social drama &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot;, Poitier played a man in a relationship with a White woman played by Katharine Houghton. The film revolves around her bringing him to meet with her parents played by Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. The film was one of the rare films at the time to depict an interracial romance in a positive light, as interracial marriage historically had been illegal in most states of the United States. It was still illegal in 17 states—mostly Southern states—until June 12, 1967, six months before the film was released. The film was a critical and financial success. In his film review, Roger Ebert described Poitier&#x27;s character as &quot;a noble, rich, intelligent, handsome, ethical medical expert&quot; and that the film &quot;is a magnificent piece of entertainment. It will make you laugh and may even make you cry.&quot; To win his role as Dr. Prentice in the film, Poitier had to audition for Tracy and Hepburn at two separate dinner parties.

Poitier began to be criticized for being typecast as over-idealized African-American characters who were not permitted to have any sexuality or personality faults, such as his character in &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot;. Poitier was aware of this pattern himself but was conflicted on the matter. He wanted more varied roles; but he also felt obliged to set an example with his characters, by challenging old stereotypes, as he was the only major actor of African descent being cast in leading roles in the American film industry at the time. For instance, in 1966, he turned down an opportunity to play the lead in an NBC television production of &quot;Othello&quot; with that spirit in mind. Despite this, many of the films in which Poitier starred during the 1960s would later be cited as social thrillers by both filmmakers and critics.

===1970–1989: Transition to directing ===
&quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; featured his most successful character, Virgil Tibbs, a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, detective whose subsequent career was the subject of two sequels: &quot;They Call Me Mister Tibbs!&quot; (1970) and &quot;The Organization&quot; (1971).

In 1972, he made his feature film directorial debut, the Western &quot;Buck and the Preacher&quot;, in which Poitier also starred, alongside Harry Belafonte and Ruby Dee. Poitier replaced the original director, Joseph Sargent. The following year he directed his second feature, the romantic drama &quot;A Warm December&quot;. Poitier also starred in the film alongside Esther Anderson.

Along with Barbra Streisand and Paul Newman, Poitier formed First Artists Production Company so actors could secure properties and develop movie projects for themselves. Working with First Artists, Poitier directed several financially successful comedy films, including three in which he also starred: &quot;Uptown Saturday Night&quot; (1974) with Bill Cosby and Harry Belafonte; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot; (1975) and &quot;A Piece of the Action&quot; (1977), both with Cosby. His most successful comedy was &quot;Stir Crazy&quot; (1980; not a First Artists production), starring Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder, which for many years was the highest-grossing film directed by a person of African descent.
In 1985, he directed &quot;Fast Forward&quot; and, in 1990, he reunited with Cosby directing him in the family comedy &quot;Ghost Dad&quot;.

In 1988, he starred in &quot;Shoot to Kill&quot; with Tom Berenger.

=== 1990–2022: Later work ===
In 1992, he starred in &quot;Sneakers&quot; with Robert Redford and Dan Aykroyd. In 1997, he co-starred in &quot;The Jackal&quot; with Richard Gere and Bruce Willis.

In the 1990s, he starred in several well received television movies and miniseries such as &quot;Separate but Equal&quot; (1991), &quot;To Sir, with Love II&quot; (1996), &quot;Mandela and de Klerk&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Simple Life of Noah Dearborn&quot; (1999). He received Emmy nominations for his work in &quot;Separate but Equal&quot; and &quot;Mandela and de Klerk&quot;, as well as a Golden Globe nomination for the former. He won a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 2001.

In 2002, Poitier received the 2001 Honorary Academy Award for his overall contribution to American cinema. Later in the ceremony, Denzel Washington won the award for Best Actor for his performance in &quot;Training Day&quot;, becoming the second Black actor to win the award. In his victory speech, Washington saluted Poitier by saying &quot;I&#x27;ll always be chasing you, Sidney. I&#x27;ll always be following in your footsteps. There&#x27;s nothing I would rather do, sir.&quot;

With the death of Ernest Borgnine in 2012, Poitier became the oldest living recipient of the Academy Award for Best Actor. On March 2, 2014, Poitier appeared with Angelina Jolie at the 86th Academy Awards to present the Best Director Award. He was given a standing ovation and Jolie thanked him for all his Hollywood contributions, stating: &quot;We are in your debt.&quot; Poitier gave a brief speech, telling his peers to &quot;keep up the wonderful work&quot; to warm applause. In 2021, the academy dedicated the lobby of the new Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles as the &quot;Sidney Poitier Grand Lobby&quot; in his honor.

Poitier was a lifelong activist for racial and social justice. He declined film roles he considered based on offensive racial stereotypes.

==Board and diplomatic service==
From 1995 to 2003, Poitier served as a member of the board of directors of The Walt Disney Company.

In April 1997, Poitier was appointed ambassador from the Bahamas to Japan, a position he held until 2007. From 2002 to 2007, he was concurrently the ambassador of the Bahamas to UNESCO.

==Personal life==

Poitier was first married to Juanita Hardy from April 29, 1950, until 1965. Though Poitier became a resident of Mount Vernon in Westchester County, New York, in 1956, they raised their family in Stuyvesant, New York, in a house on the Hudson River. In 1959, Poitier began a nine-year affair with actress Diahann Carroll. On January 23, 1976, he married Joanna Shimkus, a Canadian actress who starred with Poitier in &quot;The Lost Man&quot; in 1969, and they remained married until his death. Poitier had four daughters with his first wife: Beverly, Pamela, Sherri, and Gina. He had two daughters with his second wife: Anika and Sydney Tamiia. Poitier had eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. When Hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas in September 2019, Poitier&#x27;s family had 23 missing relatives.

==Death==
On January 6, 2022, Poitier died at his home in Beverly Hills, California, at the age of 94. His death was confirmed by Fred Mitchell, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Bahamas. According to a copy of his death certificate obtained by TMZ, the cause of death was cardiopulmonary failure, with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and prostate cancer listed as underlying causes.

Upon Poitier&#x27;s death, many people released statements honoring him, including then-President Joe Biden, who wrote in part: &quot;With unflinching grandeur and poise – his singular warmth, depth, and stature on-screen – Sidney helped open the hearts of millions and changed the way America saw itself.&quot; Former president Barack Obama paid tribute to Poitier, calling him &quot;a singular talent who epitomized dignity and grace&quot;. Michelle Obama, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton also released statements.

Many people in the entertainment industry also paid tribute to Poitier, including Martin Scorsese who wrote, &quot;For years, the spotlight was on Sidney Poitier. He had a vocal precision and physical power and grace that at moments seemed almost supernatural.&quot; Harry Belafonte, Morgan Freeman, Viola Davis, Whoopi Goldberg, Lupita Nyong&#x27;o, Halle Berry, Ava DuVernay, Oprah Winfrey, Octavia Spencer, Jeffrey Wright, Giancarlo Esposito, Quincy Jones, Michael Eisner, Ron Howard and others also paid tribute. Broadway paid tribute when its theaters dimmed their lights on January 19, 2022, at 7:45 pm ET.

The Ebertfest film festival announced it would be dedicating its 2022 event to the memory of Poitier and Gilbert Gottfried.

==Acting credits and accolades==

Poitier became the first Black actor to win the Academy Award for Best Actor for &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot; (1963). He also received a Grammy Award, two Golden Globe Awards, and a British Academy Film Award. He received numerous honoraries during his lifetime including the Academy Honorary Award for his lifetime achievement in film in 2001. In 1992, Poitier received the AFI Life Achievement Award. In 1994, Poitier received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1981, he received the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award and in 2016 he received the BAFTA Fellowship. In 2022, he was inducted into the National Multicultural Western Heritage Museum.

In 1995, he received the Kennedy Center Honor and in 2009, Poitier was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Barack Obama. He was also named an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in 1974. In 1986, he gave the Commencement Address to the University of Miami graduating class and was given the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Fine Arts.

==Legacy==

Poitier was described as an icon in his obituary by &quot;USA Today&quot;. Laura Jacobs for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; hailed Poitier as the &quot;Martin Luther King Jr. of the movies&quot;. Several film historians and journalists have called him Hollywood&#x27;s first African-American film star. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted after his death, that Poitier was instrumental for the diversity of Hollywood and &quot;paved the way for Black actors in film&quot;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that &quot;Poitier was the first actor to star in mainstream Hollywood movies that depicted a Black man in a non-stereotypical fashion, and his influence, especially during the 1950s and &#x27;60s as role model and image-maker, was immeasurable.&quot;

While presenting Poitier the Honorary Academy Award in 2002, Denzel Washington said of Poitier: &quot;Before Sidney, African American actors had to take supporting roles in major studio films that were easy to cut out in certain parts of the country. But you couldn&#x27;t cut Sidney Poitier out of a Sidney Poitier picture&quot;. He was an influential African-American actor and highly viewed as such as he became the first Black male actor to be nominated (1958) for an Academy Award (following the nominations of actresses Hattie McDaniel in 1940 and Dorothy Dandridge in 1954) and the first Black male actor to win the award. He was also described as the &quot;sole representative&quot; of African-Americans in mainstream cinema during the 1950s and 1960s, especially during the height of the American Civil Rights movement. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that Poitier was &quot;an ambassador to white America and a benign emblem of Black power&quot;. For his role in diversifying Hollywood and for his role in paving the way for further Black actors, he was described as one of &quot;the most important figures of 20th century Hollywood&quot;.

Former president of the United States Barack Obama noted that Poitier had &quot;[advanced] the nation&#x27;s dialogue on race and respect&quot; and &quot;opened doors for a generation of actors&quot;.

&quot;Sidney&quot;, a documentary film about Poitier&#x27;s life and legacy by Reginald Hudlin, was released on September 23, 2022.

<text>Human resources (HR) is the set of people who make up the workforce of an organization, business sector, industry, or economy. A narrower concept is human capital, the knowledge and skills which the individuals command. Similar terms include &quot;manpower&quot;, &quot;labor&quot;, &quot;labor-power&quot;, or &quot;personnel&quot;.

The Human Resources department (HR department, sometimes just called &quot;Human Resource&quot;) of an organization performs human resource management, overseeing various aspects of employment, such as compliance with labor law and employment standards, interviewing and selection, performance management, administration of employee benefits, organizing of employee files with the required documents for future reference, and some aspects of recruitment (also known as talent acquisition), talent management, staff wellbeing, and employee offboarding. They serve as the link between an organization&#x27;s management and its employees.

The duties include planning, recruitment and selection process, posting job ads, evaluating the performance of employees, organizing resumes and job applications, scheduling interviews and assisting in the process and ensuring background checks. Another job is payroll and benefits administration which deals with ensuring vacation and sick time are accounted for, reviewing payroll, and participating in benefits tasks, like claim resolutions, reconciling benefits statements, and approving invoices for payment. Human Resources also coordinates employee relations activities and programs including, but not limited to, employee counseling. The last job is regular maintenance, this job makes sure that the current HR files and databases are up to date, maintaining employee benefits and employment status and performing payroll/benefit-related reconciliations.

==Activities==
A human resources manager can have various functions in a company, including to: 
* Determine the needs of the staff/personnel
* Human resource accounting, determine whether to use temporary staff or hire employees to fill these needs
* Recruit and/or interview hires
* Prepare employee records and personal policies
* Manage employee payroll, benefits, and compensation
* Manage employee relations, prepare remote work and hybrid work policy
* Employee retention, talent management
* Deal with performance issues, motivate employees, monitor staff well-being
* Mediate disputes, Establish organizational culture in the organization
* Reduce workplace politics, ensure equal opportunities, reduce discrimination
* Ensure that human resources practices conform to various regulations and human resource metrics
* Apply HR software to improve HR effectivity.
* Human Resources can be evaluated empirically using various frameworks such as Stamina Model

==History==

Human resource management used to be referred to as &quot;personnel administration&quot;. In the 1920s, personnel administration focused mostly on the aspects of hiring, evaluating, and compensating employees. However, they did not focus on any employment relationships at an organizational performance level or on the systematic relationships in any parties. This led to a lacked unifying paradigm in the field during this period.

According to an &quot;HR Magazine&quot; article, the first personnel management department started at the National Cash Register Co. in 1900. The owner, John Henry Patterson, organized a personnel department to deal with grievances, discharges and safety, and information for supervisors on new laws and practices after several strikes and employee lockouts. This action was followed by other companies; for example, Ford had high turnover ratios of 380 percent in 1913, but just one year later, the line workers of the company had doubled their daily salaries from $2.50 to $5, even though $2.50 was a fair wage at that time. This example clearly shows the importance of effective management which leads to a greater outcome of employee satisfaction as well as encouraging employees to work together in order to achieve better business objectives.

During the 1970s, American businesses began experiencing challenges due to the substantial increase in competitive pressures. Companies experienced globalization, deregulation, and rapid technological change which caused the major companies to enhance their strategic planning – a process of predicting future changes in a particular environment and focus on ways to promote organizational effectiveness. This resulted in developing more jobs and opportunities for people to show their skills which were directed to effectively applying employees toward the fulfillment of individual, group, and organizational goals. Many years later the major/minor of human resource management was created at universities and colleges also known as business administration. It consists of all the activities that companies used to ensure the more effective use of employees.

Now, human resources focus on the people side of management. There are two real definitions of HRM (Human Resource Management); one is that it is the process of managing people in organizations in a structured and thorough manner. This means that it covers the hiring, firing, pay and perks, and performance management. This first definition is the modern and traditional version more like what a personnel manager would have done back in the 1920s. The second definition is that HRM circles the ideas of management of people in organizations from a macromanagement perspective like customers and competitors in a marketplace. This involves the focus on making the &quot;employment relationship&quot; fulfilling for both management and employees.

Some research showed that employees can perform at a much higher rate of productivity when their supervisors and managers paid more attention to them. The Father of Human relations, Elton Mayo, was the first person to reinforce the importance of employee communications, cooperation, and involvement. His studies concluded that sometimes the human factors are more important than physical factors, such as quality of lighting and physical workplace conditions. As a result, individuals often place value more on how they feel. For example, a rewarding system in Human resource management, applied effectively, can further encourage employees to achieve their best performance.

==Origins of the terminology==

Pioneering economist John R. Commons mentioned &quot;human resource&quot; in his 1893 book &quot;The Distribution of Wealth&quot; but did not elaborate. The expression was used during the 1910s to 1930s to promote the idea that human beings are of worth (as in human dignity); by the early 1950s, it meant people as a means to an end (for employers). Among scholars the first use of the phrase in that sense was in a 1958 report by economist E. Wight Bakke.

In regard to how individuals respond to the changes in a labor market, the following must be understood:
* Skills and qualifications: as industries move from manual to more managerial professions so does the need for more highly skilled staff. If the market is &quot;tight&quot; (i.e. not enough staff for the jobs), employers must compete for employees by offering financial rewards, community investment, etc.
* Geographical spread: how far is the job from the individual? The distance to travel to work should be in line with remuneration, and the transportation and infrastructure of the area also influence who applies for a position.
* Occupational structure: the norms and values of the different careers within an organization. Mahoney 1989 developed 3 different types of occupational structure, namely, craft (loyalty to the profession), organization career path (promotion through the firm), and unstructured (lower/unskilled workers who work when needed).
* Generational difference: different age categories of employees have certain characteristics, for example, their behavior and their expectations of the organization.

New terminology includes people operations, employee experience, employee success, people@, and partner resources.

==Criticism of its terminology and role==

One major concern about considering people as assets or resources is that they will be commoditized, objectified, and abused. Critics of the term human resources would argue that human beings are not &quot;commodities&quot; or &quot;resources&quot;, but are creative and social beings in a productive enterprise. The 2000 revision of ISO 9001, in contrast, requires identifying the processes, their sequence, and interaction, and to define and communicate responsibilities and authorities. In general, heavily unionized nations such as France and Germany have adopted and encouraged such approaches. Also, in 2001, the International Labour Organization decided to revisit and revise its 1975 Recommendation 150 on Human Resources Development, resulting in its &quot;Labour is not a commodity&quot; principle. One view of these trends is that a strong social consensus on political economy and a good social welfare system facilitate labor mobility and tend to make the entire economy more productive, as labor can develop skills and experience in various ways, and move from one enterprise to another with little controversy or difficulty in adapting.

Another important controversy regards labor mobility and the broader philosophical issue with the usage of the phrase &quot;human resources&quot;. Governments of developing nations often regard developed nations that encourage immigration or &quot;guest workers&quot; as appropriating human capital that is more rightfully part of the developing nation and required to further its economic growth. Over time, the United Nations have come to more generally support the developing nations&#x27; point of view, and have requested significant offsetting &quot;foreign aid&quot; contributions so that a developing nation losing human capital does not lose the capacity to continue to train new people in trades, professions, and the arts. Some businesses and companies are choosing to rename this department using other terms, such as &quot;people operations&quot; or &quot;culture department,&quot; in order to erase this stigma.

==Development==

Human resource companies play an important part in developing and making a company or organization at the beginning or making a success at the end, due to the labor provided by employees. Human resources are intended to show how to have better employment relations in the workforce. Also, to bring out the best work ethic of the employees and therefore making a move to a better working environment. Moreover, green human resource development is suggested as a paradigm shift from traditional approaches of human resource companies to bring awareness of ways that expertise can be applied to green practices. By integrating the expertise, knowledge, and competencies of human resource development practitioners with industry practitioners, most industries have the potential to be transformed into a sector with ecofriendly and pro-environmental culture.

Human resources also deals with essential motivators in the workplace such as payroll, benefits, team morale and workplace harassment. 

==Planning==

Administration and operations used to be the two role areas of HR. The strategic planning component came into play as a result of companies recognizing the need to consider HR needs in goals and strategies. HR directors commonly sit on company executive teams because of the HR planning function. Numbers and types of employees and the evolution of compensation systems are among elements in the planning role. Various factors affecting Human Resource planning include organizational structure, growth, business location, demographic changes, environmental uncertainties, expansion.

<text>Pope Telesphorus () was the bishop of Rome from 126 to his death 137, during the reigns of Roman Emperors Hadrian and Antoninus Pius.

Telesphorus is traditionally considered as the eighth Bishop of Rome in succession after Peter. 

==Biography==
Telesphorus was of Greek ancestry and born in Thurii (today Terranova da Sibari, Calabria), Italy.
The &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; mentions that he had been an anchorite (or hermit) monk prior to assuming office.

Eusebius (&quot;Church History&quot; iv.7; iv.14) places the beginning of his pontificate in the twelfth year of the reign of Emperor Hadrian (128–129) and gives the date of his death as being in the first year of the reign of Antoninus Pius (138–139).

As the capital of the empire was a place that allowed a wide spread of ideas, many heretics moved to Rome during his pontificate. During this period, the main heretical doctrine was Gnosticism, which Telesphorus vigorously fought because he believed it could steer religion towards a mysticism far removed from reality. The main exponent of this doctrine was the philosopher Valentinus, who at this time moved from Egypt to Rome and also managed to have a large number of followers in the capital of the empire for more than twenty years. 

A fragment of a letter from Irenæus to Pope Victor I during the Easter controversy in the late 2nd century, also preserved by Eusebius, testifies that Telesphorus was one of the Roman bishops who always celebrated Easter on Sunday, rather than on other days of the week according to the calculation of the Jewish Passover. Unlike Victor, however, Telesphorus remained in communion with those communities that did not follow this custom.

The tradition of Christmas Midnight Masses, the celebration of Easter on Sundays, the keeping of a seven-week Lent before Easter and the singing of the Gloria are usually attributed to his pontificate, however, historian Johann Peter Kirsch says that &quot;[n]one of the statements in the &quot;Liber pontificalis&quot; and other authorities of a later date as to liturgical and other decisions of this pope are genuine.&quot; 

According to the testimony of Irenaeus (&quot;Against Heresies&quot; III.3.3), he suffered martyrdom. Although most early popes are called martyrs by sources such as the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; (dating to the 3rd century at earliest), Telesphorus is the first to whom Irenaeus, writing considerably earlier (c. 180 AD), gives this title, thus making his martyrdom the earliest attested martyrdom of a pope after Peter. He was buried in the Vatican Necropolis, next to his predecessors. 

In Roman Martyrology, his feast is celebrated on 2 January; the Eastern churches celebrate it on 22 February.

==Patronage==
Until the 17th century, the Carmelites venerate Telesphorus as a patron saint of the order since some sources depict him living as a hermit. He is depicted in a stained glass window at the Carmelite monastery in Boxmeer. 

The town of Saint-Télesphore, in the southwestern part of Canada&#x27;s Quebec province, is named after him.

<doc id="46059" wikidata="Q4536313" url="?curid=46059" title="Nuclear blackmail">
<text>Nuclear blackmail is a form of nuclear strategy in which one of states uses the threat of use of nuclear weapons to force an adversary to perform some action or make some concessions. It is a type of extortion that is related to brinkmanship.

==History==
In 1950, US president Harry S. Truman publicly stated that the use of nuclear weapons was under &quot;active consideration&quot; against Chinese targets during the Korean War.

In 1953, US president Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened the use of nuclear weapons to end the Korean War if the Chinese refused to negotiate.

In order to support the continued existence of the Republic of China government, the United States issued several nuclear threats against the People&#x27;s Republic of China in the 1950s to force the evacuation of outlying islands and the cessation of attacks against Quemoy and Matsu.

Declassified documents from the UK National Archives indicate that the United Kingdom considered threatening China with nuclear retaliation in 1961 in the event of a military reclamation of Hong Kong by China.

In 1969 and onwards, US president Richard Nixon indirectly threatened North Vietnam with nuclear weapons via his madman theory. 

In 1981, the US Department of Energy said there had been 75 cases of people attempting nuclear blackmail against the US but only several were serious attempts.

In 1991, Israel threatened Iraq with a &quot;nuclear counter-response&quot; if there was an attack using chemical weapons during the Gulf War.

In 2002, the George W. Bush administration declared that it was prepared to strike with nuclear missiles against Iraq if biological or chemical weapons were used against American troops or their allies during the Iraq War.

In 2005, Chinese major general Zhu Chenghu said that China might retaliate with nuclear weapons if the United States attacked Chinese forces in a conflict over Taiwan.

On January 2, 2018, US president Donald Trump threatened North Korea by pointing out that the US has much more nuclear firepower than North Korea, in response to a press release stating that a &quot;nuclear button is on Kim Jong-un&#x27;s desk at all times.&quot;

On February 24, 2022, in the TV address where Vladimir Putin announced Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, Putin warned that any countries interfering would face consequences they had never encountered in their history. This was widely interpreted as being a threat of nuclear attack. Several days later, Putin put Russia&#x27;s nuclear forces on a higher state of alert. United States warned Russia of &quot;catastrophic&quot; consequences for Russia if Russia uses any nuclear weapons after setbacks in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

On September 25, 2024, Putin warned the West that if attacked with conventional weapons Russia would consider a nuclear retaliation. Putin went on to threaten nuclear powers that if they supported another country&#x27;s attack on Russia, then they would be considered participants in such an aggression.

On September 27, 2024, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko warned that Belarus will use nuclear weapons if attacked by the West.

<text>Anne Cécile Desclos (23 September 1907 – 27 April 1998) was a French literary critic, journalist, and novelist who wrote under the pen names Dominique Aury and Pauline Réage. She is best known for her erotic novel &quot;Story of O&quot; (1954).

== Early life ==
Born in Rochefort, Charente-Maritime, France to a bilingual family, Desclos began reading in French and English at an early age. After completing her studies at the Sorbonne, she worked as a journalist until 1946 when she joined Gallimard Publishers as the editorial secretary for one of its imprints where she began using the pen name of Dominique Aury.

An avid reader of English literature, Desclos either translated or introduced to readers in France such renowned authors as Algernon Charles Swinburne, Evelyn Waugh, Virginia Woolf, T. S. Eliot, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and numerous others. She became a critic and was made a member of the jury for several prominent literary awards.

== Career ==
Desclos&#x27; lover and employer Jean Paulhan, a fervent admirer of the Marquis de Sade, had made the remark to her that no woman was capable of writing an erotic novel. To prove him wrong, Desclos wrote a graphic, sadomasochistic novel that was published under the pseudonym Pauline Réage in June 1954. Titled &quot;Histoire d&#x27;O&quot; (&quot;Story of O&quot;), with a sympathetic preface by Jean Paulhan which nevertheless did not reveal her identity, it was an enormous, though controversial, commercial success. The book caused much speculation as to the identity of the author. Many doubted that it was a woman, let alone the demure, intellectual, and almost prudish persona displayed in Dominique Aury&#x27;s writings. Many well-known male writers were alternately suspected to be the author, including André Malraux and Henri de Montherlant.

In addition, the book&#x27;s graphic content sparked so much controversy that the following March the government authorities brought obscenity charges against the publisher and its mysterious author that were thrown out of court in 1959. However, a publicity ban and a restriction on the book&#x27;s sale to minors was imposed by the judge. Following the lifting of the publicity ban in 1967, the conclusion to &quot;Story of O&quot; was published under the title &quot;Retour à Roissy&quot; using the pseudonym of Pauline Réage. However, according to her recent biography by Angie David, Desclos did not write this second novel. In 1975, she did a long interview about erotic books with author Régine Deforges, published by &quot;Story of O&quot; editor Jean-Jacques Pauvert, yet at the time her authorship was still unknown. An English-language edition of the interview was released in the United States in 1979 by Viking Press.

Eventually, Desclos publicly admitted that she was the author of &quot;The Story of O&quot; in 1994, 40 years after the book was published, in an interview with &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. She also explained the pseudonym of Pauline Réage: she chose the first name in homage to Pauline Bonaparte and Pauline Roland and she randomly picked up the name of Réage on a topographic map.

== Documentaries ==
&quot;Writer of O&quot;, a 2004 documentary film by Pola Rapaport, mixed interviews with re-enactments of certain scenes from the book. In the documentary, the real author of &quot;Story of O&quot;, Dominique Aury (actually a pen name of Desclos), talks about the book &quot;A Girl in Love&quot;. This book was written about how &quot;Story of O&quot; was written.

A documentary was also made for BBC Radio 4 entitled &quot;The Story of O: The Vice Francaise&quot;, presented by Rowan Pelling, former editor of the &quot;Erotic Review&quot;, which looked at the history of the book and its author Desclos.

&quot;&quot;, a documentary by filmmaker Maya Gallus, featured the final interview with 90-year-old Dominique Aury (a pen name of Desclos) before she died. In the film, she recounts the extraordinary love story behind &quot;Story of O&quot; and marvels that she has reached such a grand age.

== Personal life ==
Desclos had a long-term relationship with her employer, Jean Paulhan, the director of the prestigious &quot;Nouvelle Revue Française&quot;, who was 23 years her senior. She was bisexual, and had a liaison with historian Édith Thomas, who may have been an inspiration for the character of Anne-Marie in &quot;Story of O&quot;. She had a son from a brief marriage in her early twenties.
== Legacy ==

In 2007, the National Leather Association International inaugurated awards for excellence in SM/fetish/leather writing. The categories include the Pauline Reage (a pen name of Desclos) award for fiction novel.

In 2020, Desclos was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame.
