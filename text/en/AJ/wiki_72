<text>Jean Sibelius (; ; born Johan Julius Christian Sibelius; 8 December 186520 September 1957) was a Finnish composer of the late Romantic and early modern periods. He is widely regarded as his country&#x27;s greatest composer, and his music is often credited with having helped Finland develop a stronger national identity when the country was struggling from several attempts at Russification in the late 19th century. 

The core of his oeuvre is his set of seven symphonies, which, like his other major works, are regularly performed and recorded in Finland and countries around the world. His other best-known compositions are &quot;Finlandia&quot;, the &quot;Karelia Suite&quot;, &quot;Valse triste&quot;, the Violin Concerto, the choral symphony &quot;Kullervo&quot;, and &quot;The Swan of Tuonela&quot; (from the &quot;Lemminkäinen Suite&quot;). His other works include pieces inspired by nature, Nordic mythology, and the Finnish national epic, the &quot;Kalevala;&quot; over a hundred songs for voice and piano; incidental music for numerous plays; the one-act opera &quot;The Maiden in the Tower&quot;; chamber music, piano music, Masonic ritual music, and 21 publications of choral music.

Sibelius composed prolifically until the mid-1920s, but after completing his Seventh Symphony (1924), the incidental music for &quot;The Tempest&quot; (1926), and the tone poem &quot;Tapiola&quot; (1926), he stopped producing major works in his last 30 years—a retirement commonly referred to as the &quot;silence of Järvenpää&quot; (the location of his home). Although he is reputed to have stopped composing, he attempted to continue writing, including abortive efforts on an eighth symphony. In later life, he wrote Masonic music and re-edited some earlier works, while retaining an active but not always favourable interest in new developments in music. Although this &#x27;silence&#x27; has often perplexed scholars, in reality, Sibelius was clear: he felt he had written enough.

The Finnish 100 mark note featured his image until 2002, when the euro was adopted. Since 2011, Finland has celebrated a flag flying day on 8 December, the composer&#x27;s birthday, also known as the Day of Finnish Music. In 2015, in celebration of the 150th anniversary of Sibelius&#x27;s birth, a number of special concerts and events were held, especially in Helsinki, the Finnish capital.

==Life==

===Early years===

Sibelius was born on 8 December 1865 in Hämeenlinna () in the Grand Duchy of Finland, an autonomous state within the Russian Empire. He was the son of the Swedish-speaking medical doctor Christian Gustaf Sibelius and Maria Charlotta Sibelius (née Borg). The family name stems from the Sibbe estate in Eastern Uusimaa, which his paternal great-grandfather owned. Sibelius&#x27;s father died of typhoid in July 1868, leaving substantial debts. As a result, his mother—who was again pregnant—had to sell their property and move the family into the home of Katarina Borg, her widowed mother, who also lived in Hämeenlinna. Sibelius was therefore brought up in a decidedly female environment, the only male influence coming from his uncle, Pehr Ferdinand Sibelius, who was interested in music, especially the violin. Pehr Ferdinand gave the boy a violin when he was ten years old and later encouraged him to maintain his interest in composition. For Sibelius, Uncle Pehr not only took the place of a father but acted as a musical adviser.
From an early age, Sibelius showed a strong interest in nature, frequently walking around the countryside when the family moved to Loviisa on the coast for the summer months. In his own words: &quot;For me, Loviisa represented sun and happiness. Hämeenlinna was where I went to school; Loviisa was freedom.&quot; In Hämeenlinna, when he was seven, Sibelius&#x27;s aunt Julia was brought in to give him piano lessons on the family&#x27;s upright instrument, rapping him on the knuckles whenever he played a wrong note. He progressed by improvising on his own, but still learned to read music. He later turned to the violin, which he preferred. He participated in trios with his elder sister Linda on piano, and his younger brother Christian on the cello. (Christian Sibelius was to become a psychiatrist, still remembered for his contributions to modern psychiatry in Finland.) Sibelius soon began playing in quartets with neighboring families, furthering his experience performing chamber music. Fragments survive of his early compositions of the period, a trio, a piano quartet and a &quot;Suite in D Minor&quot; for violin and piano. Around 1881, he transcribed a short pizzicato piece &quot;Vattendroppar&quot; (Water Drops) for violin, possibly as an etude or musical exercise. The first reference he made to himself composing is in a letter from August 1883 in which he writes that he composed a trio and was working on another: &quot;They are rather poor, but it is nice to have something to do on rainy days.&quot; In 1881, he began violin lessons with the local bandmaster, Gustaf Levander, immediately developing a particularly strong interest in the instrument. Setting his heart on a career as a great violin virtuoso, he soon became an accomplished player, performing David&#x27;s Concerto in E minor in 1886 and, the following year, the last two movements of Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto in Helsinki. Despite such success as an instrumentalist, he ultimately chose to become a composer.

In 1874, Sibelius attended Lucina Hagman&#x27;s Finnish-speaking preparatory school as a native Swedish speaker. In 1876, he continued his education at the Finnish-language Hämeenlinna Normal Lyceum where he was a rather absent-minded pupil, though did quite well in mathematics and botany. Despite having to repeat a year, he passed the school&#x27;s final examination in 1885, which allowed him to enter a university. As a boy he was known as Janne, a colloquial form of Johan. However, during his student years, he adopted the French form Jean, inspired by the business card of his deceased seafaring uncle. Thereafter he became known as Jean Sibelius.

===Studies and early career===
After graduating from high school in 1885, Sibelius began to study law at the Imperial Alexander University in Finland but, showing far more interest in music, soon moved to the Helsinki Music Institute (now the Sibelius Academy) where he studied from 1885 to 1889.
One of his teachers was its founder, Martin Wegelius, who did much to support the development of education in Finland. Wegelius gave the self-taught Sibelius his first formal lessons in composition. Another important influence was his teacher Ferruccio Busoni, a pianist-composer with whom he enjoyed a lifelong friendship. His close circle of friends included the pianist and writer Adolf Paul and the conductor-to-be Armas Järnefelt (who introduced him to his influential family, including his sister Aino who Sibelius would marry in 1892). The most remarkable of his works during this period was the Violin Sonata in F, rather reminiscent of Grieg.

Sibelius continued his studies in Berlin (from 1889 to 1890) with Albert Becker, and in Vienna (from 1890 to 1891) with Robert Fuchs and Hungarian-Jewish composer Karl Goldmark. In Berlin, he had the opportunity to widen his musical experience by going to a variety of concerts and operas, including the premiere of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan&quot;. He also heard the Finnish composer Robert Kajanus conducting the Berlin Philharmonic in a program that included his symphonic poem &quot;Aino&quot;, a patriotic piece that may have inspired Sibelius&#x27;s later interest in using the epic poem &quot;Kalevala&quot; as a basis for his own compositions. While in Vienna, he became particularly interested in the music of Anton Bruckner whom he regarded as &quot;the greatest living composer&quot; for a time, although also showing interest in the established works of Beethoven and Wagner. He enjoyed his year in Vienna, frequently partying and gambling with his new friends. It was also in Vienna that he turned to orchestral composition, composing an Overture in E major and a &quot;Scène de Ballet&quot;. While embarking on &quot;Kullervo&quot;, an orchestral work with chorus and soloists inspired by the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, he fell ill but was restored to good health after gallstone-excision surgery. Shortly after returning to Helsinki, Sibelius conducted his Overture and the &quot;Scène de Ballet&quot; at a popular concert. He was also able to continue working on &quot;Kullervo&quot;, now that he was increasingly developing an interest in all things Finnish. Premiered in Helsinki on 28 April 1892, the work was an enormous success.

It was around this time that Sibelius finally abandoned his cherished aspirations as a violinist:
My tragedy was that I wanted to be a celebrated violinist at any price. Since the age of 15 I played my violin practically from morning to night. I hated pen and ink—unfortunately I preferred an elegant violin bow. My love for the violin lasted quite long and it was a very painful awakening when I had to admit that I had begun my training for the exacting career of a virtuoso too late.

In addition to the long periods he spent studying in Vienna and Berlin, in 1900 he travelled to Italy, where he spent a year with his family. He composed, conducted and socialized actively in the Scandinavian countries, Britain, France and Germany and later travelled to the United States.

===Marriage and rise to fame===
While Sibelius was studying music in Helsinki in the autumn of 1888, Armas Järnefelt, a friend from the Music Institute, invited him to the family home. There he met and immediately fell in love with Aino, the 17-year-old daughter of General Alexander Järnefelt, the governor of Vaasa, and Elisabeth Clodt von Jürgensburg, a Baltic aristocrat. The wedding was held on 10 June 1892 at Maxmo. They spent their honeymoon in Karelia, the home of the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. It served as an inspiration for Sibelius&#x27;s tone poem &quot;En saga&quot;, the Lemminkäinen legends and the &quot;Karelia Suite&quot;.
Their home, Ainola, was completed near Lake Tuusula, Järvenpää, in 1904. During the years at Ainola, they had six daughters: Eva, Ruth, Kirsti (who died aged one from typhoid), Katarina, Margareta and Heidi. Eva married an industrial heir, Arvi Paloheimo, and later became the CEO of the Paloheimo Corporation. Ruth Snellman (fi) was a prominent actress, Katarina Ilves married a banker and Heidi Blomstedt was a designer, wife of architect Aulis Blomstedt. Margareta married conductor Jussi Jalas, Aulis Blomstedt&#x27;s brother.

In 1892, &quot;Kullervo&quot; inaugurated Sibelius&#x27;s focus on orchestral music. It was described by the composer as &quot;a volcanic eruption&quot; while Juho Ranta who sang in the choir stated, &quot;It was &quot;Finnish&quot; music.&quot; At the end of that year the composer&#x27;s grandmother, Katarina Borg died. Sibelius went to her funeral, visiting his Hämeenlinna home one last time before the house was sold. On 16 February 1893, the first (extended) version of &quot;En saga&quot; was presented in Helsinki although it was not too well received, the critics suggesting that superfluous sections should be eliminated (as they were in Sibelius&#x27;s 1902 version). Even less successful were three more performances of &quot;Kullervo&quot; in March, which one critic found incomprehensible and lacking in vitality. Following the birth of Sibelius&#x27;s first child Eva, in April the premiere of his choral work &quot;Väinämöinen&#x27;s Boat Ride&quot; was a considerable success, receiving the support of the press.

On 13 November 1893, the full version of &quot;Karelia&quot; was premiered at a student association gala at the Seurahuone in Viipuri with the collaboration of the artist Axel Gallén and the sculptor Emil Wikström who had been brought in to design the stage sets. While the first performance was difficult to appreciate over the background noise of the talkative audience, a second performance on 18 November was more successful. Furthermore, on the 19th and 23rd Sibelius presented an extended suite of the work in Helsinki, conducting the orchestra of the Philharmonic Society. Sibelius&#x27;s music was increasingly presented in Helsinki&#x27;s concert halls. In the 1894–95 season, works such as &quot;En saga&quot;, &quot;Karelia&quot; and &quot;Vårsång&quot; (composed in 1894) were included in at least 16 concerts in the capital, not to mention those in Turku. When performed in a revised version on 17 April 1895, the composer Oskar Merikanto welcomed &quot;Vårsång&quot; (Spring Song) as &quot;the fairest flower among Sibelius&#x27;s orchestral pieces&quot;.
For a considerable period, Sibelius worked on an opera, &quot;Veneen luominen&quot; (The Building of the Boat), again based on the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. To some extent, he had come under the influence of Wagner, but subsequently turned to Liszt&#x27;s tone poems as a source of compositional inspiration. Adapted from material for the opera, which he never completed, his &quot;Lemminkäinen Suite&quot; consisted of four legends in the form of tone poems. They were premiered in Helsinki on 13 April 1896 to a full house. In contrast to Merikanto&#x27;s enthusiasm for the Finnish quality of the work, the critic Karl Flodin found the cor anglais solo in &quot;The Swan of Tuonela&quot; &quot;stupendously long and boring&quot;, although he considered the first legend, &quot;Lemminkäinen and the Maidens of the Island&quot;, as representing the peak of Sibelius&#x27;s achievement to date.

To pay his way, from 1892 Sibelius had taken on teaching assignments at the Music Institute and at Kajanus&#x27;s conducting school but this left him insufficient time for composing. The situation improved considerably when in 1898 he was awarded a substantial annual grant, initially for ten years and later extended for life. He was able to complete the music for Adolf Paul&#x27;s play &quot;King Christian II&quot;. Performed on 24 February 1898, its catchy tunes appealed to the public. The scores of four popular pieces from the play were published in Germany and sold well in Finland. When the orchestral suite was successfully performed in Helsinki in November 1898, Sibelius commented: &quot;The music sounded excellent and the tempi seem to be right. I think this is the first time that I have managed to make something complete.&quot; The work was also performed in Stockholm and Leipzig.

In January 1899, Sibelius embarked on his First Symphony at a time when his patriotic feelings were being enhanced by the Russian emperor Nicholas II&#x27;s attempt to restrict the powers of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The symphony was well received when it was premiered in Helsinki on 26 April 1899. But the program also premiered the even more compelling, blatantly patriotic &quot;Song of the Athenians&quot; for boys&#x27; and men&#x27;s choirs. The song immediately brought Sibelius the status of a national hero. Another patriotic work followed on 4 November in the form of eight tableaux depicting episodes from Finnish history known as the &quot;Press Celebration Music&quot;. It had been written in support of the staff of the &quot;Päivälehti&quot; newspaper, which had been suspended for a period after editorially criticizing Russian rule. The last tableau, &quot;Finland Awakens&quot;, was particularly popular; after minor revisions, it became the well-known &quot;Finlandia&quot;.
In February 1900, Sibelius&#x27;s youngest daughter, Kirsti, died. Nevertheless, in the summer Sibelius went on an international tour with Kajanus and his orchestra, presenting his recent works (including a revised version of his First Symphony) in thirteen cities including Stockholm, Copenhagen, Hamburg, Berlin and Paris. The critics were highly favorable, bringing the composer international recognition with their enthusiastic reports in the &quot;Berliner Börsen-Courier&quot;, the &quot;Berliner Fremdenblatt&quot; and the &quot;Berliner Lokal Anzeiger&quot;.

During a trip with his family to Rapallo, Italy, in 1901, Sibelius began to write his Second Symphony, partly inspired by the fate of Don Juan in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. It was completed in early 1902 with its premiere in Helsinki on 8 March. The work was received with tremendous enthusiasm by the Finns. Merikanto felt it exceeded &quot;even the boldest expectations,&quot; while Evert Katila qualified it as &quot;an absolute masterpiece&quot;. Flodin, too, wrote of a symphonic composition &quot;the likes of which we have never had occasion to listen to before&quot;.

Sibelius spent the summer in Tvärminne near Hanko, where he worked on the song &quot;Var det en dröm&quot; (Was it a Dream) as well as on a new version of &quot;En saga&quot;. When it was performed in Berlin with the Berlin Philharmonic in November 1902, it served to firmly establish the composer&#x27;s reputation in Germany, leading shortly afterwards to the publication of his First Symphony.

In 1903, Sibelius spent much of his time in Helsinki where he indulged excessively in wining and dining, running up considerable bills in the restaurants. But he continued to compose, one of his major successes being &quot;Valse triste&quot;, one of six pieces of incidental music he composed for his brother-in-law Arvid Järnefelt&#x27;s play &quot;Kuolema&quot; (Death). Short of money, he sold the piece at a low price but it quickly gained considerable popularity not only in Finland but internationally. During his long stays in Helsinki, Sibelius&#x27;s wife Aino frequently wrote to him, imploring him to return home but to no avail. Even after their fourth daughter, Katarina, was born, he continued to work away from home. Early in 1904, he finished his Violin Concerto but its first public performance on 8 February was not a success. It led to a revised, condensed version that was performed in Berlin the following year.

===Move to Ainola===
In November 1903, Sibelius began to build his new home Ainola (Aino&#x27;s Place) near Lake Tuusula some 45 km (30 miles) north of Helsinki. To cover the construction costs, he gave concerts in Helsinki, Turku and Vaasa in early 1904 as well as in Tallinn, Estonia, and in Latvia during the summer. The family were finally able to move into the new property on 24 September 1904, making friends with the local artistic community, including the painters Eero Järnefelt and Pekka Halonen and the novelist Juhani Aho.

In January 1905, Sibelius returned to Berlin where he conducted his Second Symphony. While the concert itself was successful, it received mixed reviews, some very positive while those in the &quot;Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; and the &quot;Berliner Tageblatt&quot; were less enthusiastic. Back in Finland, he rewrote the increasingly popular &quot;Pelléas and Mélisande&quot; as an orchestral suite. In November, visiting Britain for the first time, he went to Liverpool where he met Henry Wood. On 2 December, he conducted the First Symphony and &quot;Finlandia&quot;, writing to Aino that the concert had been a great success and widely acclaimed.

In 1906, after a short, rather uneventful stay in Paris at the beginning of the year, Sibelius spent several months composing in Ainola, his major work of the period being &quot;Pohjola&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, yet another piece based on the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. Later in the year he composed incidental music for &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot;, also adapting it as an orchestral suite. He ended the year conducting a series of concerts, the most successful being the first public performance of &quot;Pohjola&#x27;s Daughter&quot; at the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg.

===Ups and downs===
From the beginning of 1907, Sibelius again indulged in excessive wining and dining in Helsinki, spending exorbitant amounts on champagne and lobster. His lifestyle had a disastrous effect on the health of Aino who was driven to retire to a sanatorium, suffering from exhaustion. While she was away, Sibelius resolved to give up drinking, concentrating instead on composing his Third Symphony. He completed the work for a performance in Helsinki on 25 September. Although its more classical approach surprised the audience, Flodin commented that it was &quot;internally new and revolutionary&quot;.

Shortly afterwards Sibelius met Austro-Bohemian composer Gustav Mahler who was in Helsinki. The two agreed that with each new symphony, they lost those who had been attracted to their earlier works. This was demonstrated above all in St Petersburg where the Third Symphony was performed in November 1907 to dismissive reviews. Its reception in Moscow was rather more positive.
In 1907, Sibelius underwent a serious operation for suspected throat cancer. Early in 1908, he had to spend a spell in hospital. His smoking and drinking had now become life-threatening. Although he cancelled concerts in Rome, Warsaw and Berlin, he maintained an engagement in London but there too his Third Symphony failed to attract the critics. In May 1908, Sibelius&#x27;s health deteriorated further. He travelled with his wife to Berlin to have a tumour removed from his throat. After the operation, he vowed to give up smoking and drinking once and for all. The impact of this brush with death has been said to have inspired works that he composed in the following years, including &quot;Luonnotar&quot; and the Fourth Symphony.

===More pleasant times===
In 1909, the successful throat operation resulted in renewed happiness between Sibelius and Aino in the family home. In Britain too, his condition was well received as he conducted &quot;En saga&quot;, &quot;Finlandia&quot;, &quot;Valse Triste&quot; and &quot;Spring Song&quot; to enthusiastic audiences. A meeting with Claude Debussy produced further support. After another uneventful trip to Paris, he went to Berlin where he was relieved to learn that his throat operation had been entirely successful.

Sibelius started work on his Fourth Symphony in early 1910 but his dwindling funds also required him to write a number of smaller pieces and songs. In October, he conducted concerts in Kristiania (now Oslo) where &quot;The Dryad&quot; and &quot;In Memoriam&quot; were first performed. His &quot;Valse triste&quot; and Second Symphony were particularly well received. He then travelled to Berlin to continue work on his Fourth Symphony, writing the finale after returning to Järvenpää.

Sibelius conducted his first concerts in Sweden in early 1911 when even his Third Symphony was welcomed by the critics. He completed the Fourth Symphony in April but, as he expected, with its introspective style it was not very warmly received when first performed in Helsinki with mixed reviews. Apart from a trip to Paris where he enjoyed a performance of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot;, the rest of the year was fairly uneventful. In 1912, he completed his short orchestral work &quot;Scènes historiques II&quot;. It was first performed in March together with the Fourth Symphony. The concert was repeated twice to enthusiastic audiences and critics including Robert Kajanus. The Fourth Symphony was also well received in Birmingham in September. In March 1913, it was performed in New York but a large section of the audience left the hall between the movements while in October, after a concert conducted by Carl Muck, the &quot;Boston American&quot; labelled it &quot;a sad failure&quot;.

Sibelius&#x27;s first significant composition of 1913 was the tone poem &quot;The Bard&quot;, which he conducted in March to a respectful audience in Helsinki. He went on to compose &quot;Luonnotar&quot; (Daughter of Nature) for soprano and orchestra. With a text from the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, it was first performed in Finnish in September 1913 by Aino Ackté (to whom it had been dedicated) at the music festival in Gloucester, England. In early 1914, Sibelius spent a month in Berlin where he was particularly drawn to Arnold Schoenberg. Back in Finland, he began work on &quot;The Oceanides&quot;, which the American millionaire Carl Stoeckel had commissioned for the Norfolk Music Festival. After first composing the work in D-flat major, Sibelius undertook substantive revisions, presenting a D major version in Norfolk, which was well received, as were &quot;Finlandia&quot; and the &quot;Valse triste&quot;. Henry Krehbiel considered &quot;The Oceanides&quot; one of the most beautiful pieces of sea music ever composed, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that Sibelius&#x27;s music was the most notable contribution to the music festival. While in America, Sibelius received an honorary doctorate from Yale University and, almost simultaneously, one from the University of Helsinki where he was represented by Aino.

===First World War years===
While travelling back from the United States, Sibelius heard about the events in Sarajevo that led to the beginning of the First World War. Although he was far away from the fighting, his royalties from abroad were interrupted. To make ends meet, he composed smaller works for publication in Finland. In March 1915, he was able to travel to Gothenburg in Sweden, where his work &quot;The Oceanides&quot; was widely appreciated. While working on his Fifth Symphony in April, he saw 16 swans flying by, inspiring him to write the finale. &quot;One of the great experiences of my life!&quot; he commented. Although there was little progress on the symphony during the summer, he was able to complete it by his 50th birthday on 8 December.

On the evening of his birthday, Sibelius conducted the premiere of the Fifth Symphony in the hall of the Helsinki Stock Exchange. Despite high praise from Kajanus, the composer was not satisfied with his work and soon began to revise it. Around this time, Sibelius was running ever deeper into debt. The grand piano he had received as a present was about to be confiscated by the bailiffs when the singer Ida Ekman paid off a large proportion of his debt after a successful fund-raising campaign.

A year later, on 8 December 1916, Sibelius presented the revised version of his Fifth Symphony in Turku, combining the first two movements and simplifying the finale. When it was performed a week later in Helsinki, Katila was very favourable but Wasenius frowned on the changes, leading the composer to rewrite it once again.

From the beginning of 1917, Sibelius started drinking again, triggering arguments with Aino. Their relationship improved with the excitement resulting from the start of the Russian Revolution. By the end of the year, Sibelius had composed his &quot;Jäger March&quot;. The piece proved particularly popular after the Finnish parliament accepted the Senate&#x27;s declaration of independence from Russia in December 1917. The &quot;Jäger March&quot;, first played on 19 January 1918, delighted the Helsinki elite for a short time until the start of the Finnish Civil War on 27 January. Sibelius naturally supported the Whites, but as a Tolstoyan, Aino Sibelius had some sympathies for the Reds too.

In February, his house (Ainola) was searched twice by the local Red Guard looking for weapons. During the first weeks of the war, some of his acquaintances were killed in the violence, and his brother, the psychiatrist Christian Sibelius, was arrested because he refused to reserve beds for the Red soldiers who had suffered shell shock at the front. Sibelius&#x27;s friends in Helsinki were now worried about his safety. The composer Robert Kajanus negotiated with the Red Guard commander-in-chief Eero Haapalainen, who guaranteed Sibelius a safe journey from Ainola to the capital. On 20 February, a group of Red Guard fighters escorted the family to Helsinki. Finally, from 12 to 13 April, the German troops occupied the city and the Red period was over. A week later, the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra gave a concert in homage to the German commander Rüdiger von der Goltz. Sibelius finished off the event by conducting the &quot;Jäger March&quot;.

===Revived fortunes but growing hand tremor ===
In early 1919, Sibelius enthusiastically decided to change his image, shaving off what remained of his thinning hair. In June, together with Aino, he visited Copenhagen on his first trip outside Finland since 1915, successfully presenting his Second Symphony. In November he conducted the final version of his Fifth Symphony, receiving repeated ovations from the audience. By the end of the year, he was already working on the Sixth.

In 1920, despite a growing tremor in his hands, Sibelius composed the &quot;Hymn of the Earth&quot; to a text by the poet Eino Leino for the Suomen Laulu Choir and orchestrated his &quot;Valse lyrique&quot;, helped along by drinking wine. On his birthday in December 1920, Sibelius received a donation of 63,000 marks, a substantial sum the tenor had raised from Finnish businesses. Although he used some of the money to reduce his debts, he also spent a week celebrating to excess in Helsinki.

At this time, Sibelius held detailed negotiations with George Eastman, inventor of the Kodak camera and founder of the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York. Eastman offered $20,000 salary to teach for a single year, and before Sibelius declined, negotiations were so firm that the &quot;New York Times&quot; published Sibelius&#x27;s arrival as fact.

Sibelius enjoyed a highly successful trip to England in early 1921—conducting several concerts around the country, including the Fourth and Fifth symphonies, &quot;The Oceanides&quot;, the ever-popular &quot;Finlandia&quot;, and &quot;Valse triste&quot;. Immediately afterwards, he conducted the Second Symphony and &quot;Valse triste&quot; in Norway. He was beginning to suffer from exhaustion, but the critics remained positive. On his return to Finland in April, he presented &quot;Lemminkäinen&#x27;s Return&quot; and the Fifth Symphony at the Nordic Music Days.

Early in 1922, after suffering from headaches Sibelius decided to acquire spectacles although he never wore them for photographs. In July, he was saddened by the death of his brother Christian. In August, he joined the Finnish Freemasons and composed ritual music for them. In February 1923, he premiered his Sixth Symphony. Evert Katila highly praised it as &quot;pure idyll.&quot; Before the year ended he had also conducted concerts in Stockholm and Rome, the first to considerable acclaim, the second to mixed reviews. He then proceeded to Gothenburg where he enjoyed an ecstatic reception despite arriving at the concert hall suffering from over-indulgence in food and drink. Despite continuing to drink, to Aino&#x27;s dismay, Sibelius managed to complete his Seventh Symphony in March 1924. Under the title of &quot;Fantasia sinfonica&quot; it received its first public performance in Stockholm where it was a success. It was even more highly appreciated at a series of concerts in Copenhagen in late September. Sibelius was honoured with the Knight Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog.

He spent most of the rest of the year resting as his recent spate of activity was straining his heart and nerves. Composing a few small pieces, he relied increasingly on alcohol. In May 1925, his Danish publisher Wilhelm Hansen and the Royal Danish Theatre invited him to compose incidental music for a production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. He completed the work well in advance of its premiere in March 1926. It was well received in Copenhagen although Sibelius was not there himself.

The music journalist Vesa Sirén has found evidence that Sibelius perhaps suffered from essential tremor since a young age and that he reduced the symptoms by drinking alcohol. This self-medication is common and effective but discouraged by doctors due to the risks outweighing the benefits. Sirén&#x27;s research is supported by several medical experts. The tremor presumably prevented writing and impaired his social life.

===Last major works===
The year 1926 saw a sharp and lasting decline in Sibelius&#x27;s output: after his Seventh Symphony, he produced only a few major works during the rest of his life. Arguably the two most significant of these were the incidental music for &quot;The Tempest&quot; and the tone poem &quot;Tapiola&quot;. For most of the last thirty years of his life, Sibelius even avoided talking publicly about his music.

There is substantial evidence that Sibelius worked on an eighth symphony. He promised the premiere of this symphony to Serge Koussevitzky in 1931 and 1932, and a London performance in 1933 under Basil Cameron was even advertised to the public. The only concrete evidence of the symphony&#x27;s existence on paper is a 1933 bill for a fair copy of the first movement and short draft fragments first published and played in 2011. Sibelius had always been quite self-critical; he remarked to his close friends, &quot;If I cannot write a better symphony than my Seventh, then it shall be my last.&quot; Since no manuscript survives, sources consider it likely that Sibelius destroyed most traces of the score, probably in 1945, during which year he certainly consigned a great many papers to the flames. His wife Aino recalled,
In the 1940s there was a great &quot;auto da fé&quot; at Ainola. My husband collected a number of the manuscripts in a laundry basket and burned them on the open fire in the dining room. Parts of the &quot;Karelia Suite&quot; were destroyed – I later saw remains of the pages which had been torn out – and many other things. I did not have the strength to be present and left the room. I therefore do not know what he threw on to the fire. But after this my husband became calmer and gradually lighter in mood.

Despite his withdrawing from the public eye, Sibelius&#x27;s work gained substantial attention in the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s thanks to the newly established Finnish broadcaster YLE. Broadcasting on AM wavebands, YLE&#x27;s signals brought Sibelius&#x27;s music to listeners beyond Finland&#x27;s borders, too. In 1933, YLE and the Helsinki City Orchestra with soloist Anja Ignatius originated a broadcast of Sibelius compositions to 14 countries in coordination with the International Broadcasting Union. The program included the tone poem &quot;The Oceanides&quot;, followed by his Fifth Symphony, and the Violin Concerto. In 1935 The New York Philharmonic surveyed the preferences of music listeners around the United States. When asked who their favourite composer was, Sibelius came first among all of them, living or dead. This degree of recognition during his own lifetime was unequalled in Western music.

===Second World War years===

On Sibelius&#x27;s 70th birthday (8 December 1935), the German Nazi regime awarded him the Goethe-Medal with a certificate signed by Adolf Hitler. After the attempted Soviet invasion of Finland in late 1939 to 1940 (the Winter War) which, though initially repelled, forced Finland to cede territory to the Soviet Union after the later defeat of the Finnish military, the Sibelius family returned for good to Ainola in the summer of 1941, after a long absence. Anxious about Bolshevism, Sibelius advocated that Finnish soldiers march alongside German forces after Germany&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. Sibelius did not make any utterances about the genocide of the Jews, although, in a diary entry in 1943, he wondered why he had signed the Aryan certificate.

On 1 January 1939, Sibelius had participated in an international radio broadcast during which he conducted his &quot;Andante Festivo&quot;. The performance was preserved on transcription discs and later issued on CD. This is probably the only surviving example of Sibelius interpreting his own music.

===Final years and death===
From 1903 and for many years thereafter Sibelius lived in the countryside. From 1939 he and Aino again had a home in Helsinki, but they moved back to Ainola in 1941, only occasionally visiting the city. After the war he returned to Helsinki only a couple of times. The so-called &quot;silence of Järvenpää&quot; became something of a myth, as in addition to countless official visitors and colleagues, his grandchildren and great-grandchildren also spent their holidays there.

Sibelius avoided public statements about other composers, but Erik W. Tawaststjerna and Sibelius&#x27;s secretary Santeri Levas have documented private conversations in which he admired Richard Strauss and considered Béla Bartók and Dmitri Shostakovich the most talented composers of the younger generation. In the 1950s he promoted the young Finnish composer Einojuhani Rautavaara.

His 90th birthday, in 1955, was widely celebrated, and both the Philadelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Sir Thomas Beecham gave special performances of his music.

Tawaststjerna also relates an anecdote in connection with Sibelius&#x27;s death:
[He] was returning from his customary morning walk. Exhilarated, he told his wife Aino that he had seen a flock of cranes approaching. &quot;There they come, the birds of my youth,&quot; he exclaimed. Suddenly, one of the birds broke away from the formation and circled once above Ainola. It then rejoined the flock to continue its journey.
Two years later in Ainola, on the evening of 20 September 1957, Sibelius died of a brain hemorrhage at the age of 91. At the time of his death, his Fifth Symphony, conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent, was being broadcast by radio from Helsinki. At the same time, the United Nations General Assembly was in session, and the then President of the Assembly, Sir Leslie Munro of New Zealand, called for a moment of silence and delivered a eulogy: &quot;Sibelius belonged to the whole world. He enriched the life of the entire human race with his music&quot;. Another well-known Finnish composer, Heino Kaski, died on the same day, but his death was overshadowed by that of Sibelius. Sibelius was honoured with a state funeral and is buried in the garden at Ainola.

Aino Sibelius continued to live in Ainola for the next 12 years until her death on 8 June 1969 at the age of 97. She is buried next to her husband.

==Music==
Sibelius is widely known for his symphonies and his tone poems, especially &quot;Finlandia&quot; and the &quot;Karelia suite&quot;. His reputation in Finland grew in the 1890s with the choral symphony &quot;Kullervo&quot;, which like many subsequent pieces drew on the epic poem &quot;Kalevala&quot;. His First Symphony was first performed to an enthusiastic audience in 1899 at a time when Finnish nationalism was evolving. In addition to six more symphonies, he gained popularity at home and abroad with incidental music and more tone poems, especially &quot;En saga&quot;, &quot;The Swan of Tuonela&quot; and &quot;Valse triste&quot;. Sibelius also composed a series of works for violin and orchestra including a Violin Concerto, the opera &quot;Jungfrun i tornet&quot;, many shorter orchestral pieces, chamber music, works for piano and violin, choral works and numerous songs.

In the mid-1920s, after his Sixth and Seventh Symphonies, he composed the symphonic poem &quot;Tapiola&quot; and incidental music for &quot;The Tempest&quot;. Thereafter, although he lived until 1957, he did not publish any further works of note. For several years, he worked on an Eighth Symphony, which he later burned.

As for his musical style, hints of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music are particularly evident in early works such as his First Symphony and his Violin Concerto. For a period, he was nevertheless overwhelmed by Wagner, particularly while composing his opera. More lasting influences included Ferruccio Busoni and Anton Bruckner. But for his tone poems, he was above all inspired by Liszt. The similarities to Bruckner can be seen in the brass contributions to his orchestral works and the generally slow tempo of his music.

Sibelius progressively stripped away formal markers of sonata form in his work and, instead of contrasting multiple themes, focused on the idea of continuously evolving cells and fragments culminating in a grand statement. His later works are remarkable for their sense of unbroken development, progressing by means of thematic permutations and derivations. The completeness and organic feel of this synthesis has prompted some to suggest that Sibelius began his works with a finished statement and worked backwards, although analyses showing these predominantly three- and four-note cells and melodic fragments as they are developed and expanded into the larger &quot;themes&quot; effectively prove the opposite.
This self-contained structure stood in stark contrast to the symphonic style of Gustav Mahler, Sibelius&#x27;s primary rival in symphonic composition. While thematic variation played a major role in the works of both composers, Mahler&#x27;s style made use of disjunct, abruptly changing and contrasting themes, while Sibelius sought to slowly transform thematic elements. In November 1907 Mahler undertook a conducting tour of Finland, and the two composers were able to take a lengthy walk together, leading Sibelius to comment:
I said that I admired [the symphony&#x27;s] severity of style and the profound logic that created an inner connection between all the motifs ... Mahler&#x27;s opinion was just the reverse. &quot;No, a symphony must be like the world. It must embrace everything.&quot;

===Symphonies===
Sibelius started work on his Symphony No. 1 in E minor, Op. 39, in 1898 and completed it in early 1899, when he was 33. The work was first performed on 26 April 1899 by the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by the composer, in an original, well received version that has not survived. After the premiere, Sibelius made some revisions, resulting in the version performed today. The revision was completed in the spring and summer of 1900, and was first performed in Berlin by the Helsinki Philharmonic, conducted by Robert Kajanus on 18 July 1900. The symphony begins with a highly original, rather forlorn clarinet solo backed by subdued timpani.
His Second Symphony, the most popular and most frequently recorded of his symphonies, was first performed by the Helsinki Philharmonic Society on 8 March 1902, with the composer conducting. The opening chords with their rising progression provide a motif for the whole work. The heroic theme of the finale with the three-tone motif is interpreted by the trumpets rather than the original woodwinds. During a period of Russian oppression, it consolidated Sibelius&#x27;s reputation as a national hero. After the first performance, Sibelius made some changes, leading to a revised version first performed by Armas Järnefelt on 10 November 1903 in Stockholm.

The Third Symphony is a good-natured, triumphal, and deceptively simple-sounding piece. The symphony&#x27;s first performance was given by the Helsinki Philharmonic Society, conducted by the composer, on 25 September 1907. There are themes from Finnish folk music in the work&#x27;s early chords. Composed just after his move to Ainola, it contrasts sharply with the first two symphonies, with its clear mode of expression developing into the marching tones of the finale.

His Fourth Symphony was premiered in Helsinki on 3 April 1911 by the Philharmonia Society, with Sibelius conducting. It was written while Sibelius was undergoing a series of operations to remove a tumour from his throat. Its grimness can perhaps be explained as a reaction from his (temporary) decision to give up drinking. The opening bars, with cellos, basses and bassoons, convey a new approach to timing. It then develops into melancholic sketches based on the composer&#x27;s setting of Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Raven&quot;. The waning finale is perhaps a premonition of the silence Sibelius would experience twenty years later. In contrast to the usual assertive finales of the times, the work ends simply with a &quot;leaden thud&quot;.

The Symphony No. 5 was premiered in Helsinki to great acclaim by Sibelius himself on 8 December 1915, his 50th birthday. The version most commonly performed today is the final revision, consisting of three movements, presented in 1919. The Fifth is Sibelius&#x27;s only symphony in a major key throughout. From its soft opening played by the horns, the work develops into rotational repetitions of its various themes with considerable transformations, building up to the trumpeted swan hymn in the final movement.

While the Fifth had already started to veer away from the sonata form, the Sixth, conducted by the composer at its premiere in February 1923, is even further removed from the traditional norms. Tawaststjerna comments that &quot;the [finale&#x27;s] structure follows no familiar pattern&quot;. Composed in the Dorian mode, it draws on some of the themes developed while Sibelius was working on the Fifth as well as from material intended for a lyrical violin concerto. Now taking a purified approach, Sibelius sought to offer &quot;spring water&quot; rather than cocktails, making use of lighter flutes and strings rather than the heavy brass of the Fifth.

The Symphony No. 7 in C major was his last published symphony. Completed in 1924, it is notable for having only one movement. It has been described as &quot;completely original in form, subtle in its handling of tempi, individual in its treatment of key and wholly organic in growth&quot;. It has also been called &quot;Sibelius&#x27;s most remarkable compositional achievement&quot;. Initially titled &quot;Fantasia sinfonica&quot;, it was first performed in Stockholm in March 1924, conducted by Sibelius. It was based on an adagio movement he had sketched almost ten years earlier. While the strings dominate, there is also a distinctive trombone theme.

===Tone poems===
After the seven symphonies and the violin concerto, Sibelius&#x27;s thirteen symphonic poems are his most important works for orchestra and, along with the tone poems of Richard Strauss, represent some of the most important contributions to the genre since Franz Liszt. As a group, the symphonic poems span the entirety of Sibelius&#x27;s artistic career (the first was composed in 1892, while the last appeared in 1925), display the composer&#x27;s fascination with nature and Finnish mythology (particularly the &quot;Kalevala&quot;), and provide a comprehensive portrait of his stylistic maturation over time.
&quot;En saga&quot; (meaning &quot;A Fairy Tale&quot; in Swedish) was first presented in February 1893 with Sibelius conducting. The single-movement tone poem was possibly inspired by the Icelandic mythological work &quot;Edda&quot; although Sibelius simply described it as &quot;an expression of [his] state of mind&quot;. Beginning with a dreamy theme from the strings, it evolves into the tones of the woodwinds, then the horns and the violas, demonstrating Sibelius&#x27;s ability to handle an orchestra. The composer&#x27;s first significant orchestral piece, it was revised in 1902 when Ferruccio Busoni invited Sibelius to conduct his work in Berlin. Its successful reception encouraged him to write to Aino: &quot;I have been acknowledged as an accomplished &#x27;artist.

&quot;The Wood Nymph&quot;, a single-movement tone poem for orchestra, was written in 1894. Premiered in April 1895 in Helsinki with Sibelius conducting, it is inspired by the Swedish poet Viktor Rydberg&#x27;s work of the same name. Organizationally, it consists of four informal sections, each corresponding to one of the poem&#x27;s four stanzas and evoking the mood of a particular episode: first, heroic vigour; second, frenetic activity; third, sensual love; and fourth, inconsolable grief. Despite the music&#x27;s beauty, many critics have faulted Sibelius for his &quot;over-reliance&quot; on the source material&#x27;s narrative structure.

The &quot;Lemminkäinen Suite&quot; was composed in the early 1890s. Originally conceived as a mythological opera, &quot;Veneen luominen&quot; (&quot;The Building of the Boat&quot;), on a scale matching those by Richard Wagner, Sibelius later changed his musical goals and the work became an orchestral piece in four movements. The suite is based on the character Lemminkäinen from the Finnish national epic, the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. It can also be considered a collection of symphonic poems. The second/third section, &quot;The Swan of Tuonela&quot;, is often heard separately.

&quot;Finlandia&quot;, probably the best known of all Sibelius&#x27;s works, is a highly patriotic piece first performed in November 1899 as one of the tableaux for the Finnish Press Celebrations. It had its public premiere in revised form in July 1900. The current title only emerged later, first for the piano version, then in 1901 when Kajanus conducted the orchestral version under the name &quot;Finlandia&quot;. Although Sibelius insisted it was primarily an orchestral piece, it became a world favourite for choirs too, especially for the hymn episode. Finally the composer consented and in 1937 and 1940 agreed to words for the hymn, first for the Freemasons and later for more general use.

&quot;The Oceanides&quot; is a single-movement tone poem for orchestra written in 1913–14. The piece, which refers to the nymphs in Greek mythology who inhabited the Mediterranean Sea, premiered on 4 June 1914 at the Norfolk Music Festival in Connecticut with Sibelius himself conducting. The work (in D major), praised upon its premiere as &quot;the finest evocation of the sea ever produced in music&quot;, consists of two subjects Sibelius gradually develops in three informal stages: first, a placid ocean; second, a gathering storm; and third, a thunderous wave-crash climax. As the tempest subsides, a final chord sounds, symbolizing the mighty power and limitless expanse of the sea.

&quot;Tapiola&quot;, Sibelius&#x27;s last major orchestral work, was commissioned by Walter Damrosch for the New York Philharmonic Society where it was premiered on 26 December 1926. It is inspired by Tapio, a forest spirit from the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. To quote the American critic Alex Ross, it &quot;turned out to be Sibelius&#x27;s most severe and concentrated musical statement.&quot; Even more emphatically, the composer and biographer Cecil Gray asserts: &quot;Even if Sibelius had written nothing else, this one work would entitle him to a place among the greatest masters of all time.&quot;

===Other important works===
The &quot;Karelia Music&quot;, one of the composer&#x27;s earlier works, written for the Vyborg Students&#x27; Association, was first performed on 13 November 1893 to a noisy audience. The &quot;Suite&quot; emerged from a concert on 23 November consisting of the overture and the three movements, which were published as the &quot;Karelia Overture&quot;, Op. 10, and the &quot;Karelia Suite&quot;, Op. 11. It remains one of Sibelius&#x27;s most popular pieces.

&quot;Valse triste&quot; is a short orchestral work that was originally part of the incidental music Sibelius composed for his brother-in-law Arvid Järnefelt&#x27;s 1903 play &quot;Kuolema&quot; (&quot;Death&quot;). It is now far better known as a separate concert piece. Sibelius wrote six pieces for the 2 December 1903 production of &quot;Kuolema&quot;. The waltz accompanied a sequence in which a woman rises from her deathbed to dance with ghosts. In 1904, Sibelius revised the piece for a performance in Helsinki on 25 April where it was presented as &quot;Valse triste&quot;. An instant success, it took on a life of its own, and remains one of Sibelius&#x27;s signature pieces.

The Violin Concerto in D minor was first performed on 8 February 1904 with Victor Nováček as soloist. As Sibelius had barely completed the piece in time for the premiere, Nováček had insufficient time to prepare, with the result that the performance was a disaster. After substantial revisions, a new version was premiered on 19 October 1905 with Richard Strauss conducting the Berlin Court Orchestra. With Karel Halíř, the orchestra&#x27;s leader, as soloist it was a tremendous success. The piece has become increasingly popular and is now the most frequently recorded of all the violin concertos composed in the 20th century.

&quot;Kullervo&quot;, one of Sibelius&#x27;s early works, is sometimes referred to as a choral symphony but is better described as a suite of five symphonic movements resembling tone poems. Based on the character Kullervo from the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, it was premiered on 28 April 1892 with Emmy Achté and Abraham Ojanperä as soloists and Sibelius conducting the chorus and orchestra of the recently founded Helsinki Orchestra Society. Although the work was only performed five times during the composer&#x27;s lifetime, since the 1990s it has become increasingly popular both for live performances and recordings.

==Activities and interests==
When Freemasonry in Finland was revived, having been forbidden under the Russian reign, Sibelius was one of the founding members of Suomi Lodge No. 1 in 1922 and later became the Grand Organist of the Grand Lodge of Finland. He composed the ritual music used in Finland (Op. 113) in 1927 and added two new pieces composed in 1946. The new revision of the ritual music of 1948 is one of his last works.
Sibelius loved nature, and the Finnish landscape often served as material for his music. He once said of his Sixth Symphony, &quot;[It] always reminds me of the scent of the first snow.&quot; The forests surrounding Ainola are often said to have inspired his composition of &quot;Tapiola&quot;. On the subject of Sibelius&#x27;s ties to nature, his biographer, Tawaststjerna, wrote:
Even by Nordic standards, Sibelius responded with exceptional intensity to the moods of nature and the changes in the seasons: he scanned the skies with his binoculars for the geese flying over the lake ice, listened to the screech of the cranes, and heard the cries of the curlew echo over the marshy grounds just below Ainola. He savoured the spring blossoms every bit as much as he did autumnal scents and colours.

==Reception==
The composer and academic Elliott Schwartz wrote (1964), &quot;It may be said with truth that Vaughan Williams, Sibelius and Prokofieff are the symphonists of this century&quot;. Indeed, Sibelius exerted considerable influence on symphonic composers and musical life. His impact is perhaps the greatest in English-speaking and Nordic countries. The Finnish symphonist Leevi Madetoja was a pupil of Sibelius (for more on their relationship, see Relationship with Sibelius). In Britain, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Arnold Bax both dedicated their fifth symphonies to Sibelius. Vaughan Williams said of him &quot;You have lit a candle in the world of music that will never go out.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;Tapiola&quot; is prominently echoed in both Bax&#x27;s Sixth Symphony and Ernest John Moeran&#x27;s Symphony in G minor. The influence of Sibelius&#x27;s compositional procedures is also strongly felt in the First Symphony of William Walton. When these and several other major British symphonic essays were being written in and around the 1930s, Sibelius&#x27;s music was very much in vogue, with conductors Thomas Beecham and John Barbirolli championing its cause both in the concert hall and on record. Walton&#x27;s composer friend Constant Lambert even asserted that Sibelius was &quot;the first great composer since Beethoven whose mind thinks naturally in terms of symphonic form&quot;. Earlier, Granville Bantock had championed Sibelius. The esteem was mutual: Sibelius dedicated his Third Symphony to the English composer, and in 1946 he became the first President of the Bantock Society. More recently, Sibelius was also one of the composers championed by Robert Simpson. Malcolm Arnold acknowledged his influence, and Arthur Butterworth also saw Sibelius&#x27;s music as a source of inspiration in his work.

New Zealand&#x27;s most accomplished 20th century composer, Douglas Lilburn, wrote of the inspiration he derived from Sibelius&#x27;s work, particularly from his earlier compositions.

Eugene Ormandy and his predecessor at the Philadelphia Orchestra Leopold Stokowski, were instrumental in bringing Sibelius&#x27;s music to American audiences by frequently programming his works; the former developed a friendly relationship with Sibelius throughout his life. Later in life, Sibelius was championed by the American critic Olin Downes, who wrote a biography of the composer.

In 1938 Theodor Adorno wrote a critical essay, notoriously charging that &quot;If Sibelius is good, this invalidates the standards of musical quality that have persisted from Bach to Schoenberg: the richness of inter-connectedness, articulation, unity in diversity, the &#x27;multi-faceted&#x27; in &#x27;the one&#x27;.&quot; Adorno sent his essay to Virgil Thomson, then music critic of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, who was also critical of Sibelius. Thomson, while agreeing with the essay&#x27;s sentiment, declared to Adorno that &quot;the tone of it [was] more apt to create antagonism toward [Adorno] than toward Sibelius&quot;. Later, the composer, theorist and conductor René Leibowitz went so far as to describe Sibelius as &quot;the worst composer in the world&quot; in the title of a 1955 pamphlet.

Perhaps one reason why Sibelius has attracted both praise and ire from critics is that, in each of his seven symphonies, he approached the challenges of form, tonality, and architecture in unique, individual ways. On the one hand, his symphonic (and tonal) creativity was novel, while others thought that music should be taking a different route. Sibelius&#x27;s response to criticism was dismissive: &quot;Pay no attention to what critics say. No statue has ever been put up to a critic.&quot;
In the later decades of the twentieth century, Sibelius came to be seen more favourably. Many influential 20th and 21st-century composers, including Morton Feldman, Gerard Grisey, and Magnus Lindberg, have expressed high regard for his compositions. The American composer Jonathan Blumhofer has said: &quot;The visionary aspects of Sibelius’ music, particularly the tight unity of musical elements and his singular way with large-scale forms, have helped ensure him that rarest of gifts given popular composers: a measure of academic respectability.&quot; Milan Kundera said the composer&#x27;s approach was that of &quot;antimodern modernism&quot;, standing outside “the status quo of perpetual progress”. Similarly, the philosopher Slavoj Žižek contrasts Sibelius to the &quot;modernist&quot; approach of Schoenberg and the &quot;post-modernist&quot; one of Stravinsky; for Žižek, Sibelius represents the alternative of &quot;persistent traditionalism&quot;, of continuing in the inherited tradition but with artistic integrity, not as a &quot;phony conservative&quot;. In 1990, the composer Thea Musgrave was commissioned by the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra to write a piece in honour of the 125th anniversary of Sibelius&#x27;s birth: &quot;Song of the Enchanter&quot; premiered on 14 February 1991. In 1984, the American avant-garde composer Morton Feldman gave a lecture in Darmstadt, Germany, wherein he stated that &quot;the people you think are radicals might really be conservatives – the people you think are conservatives might really be radical&quot;, whereupon he began to hum Sibelius&#x27;s Fifth Symphony.

Writing in 1996, the Pulitzer Prize-winning music critic Tim Page stated, &quot;There are two things to be said straightaway about Sibelius. First, he is terribly uneven (much of his chamber music, a lot of his songs and most of his piano music might have been churned out by a second-rate salon composer from the 19th century on an off afternoon). Second, at his very best, he is often weird.&quot; Pianist Leif Ove Andsnes offers a counterweight to Page&#x27;s assessment of Sibelius&#x27;s piano music. Acknowledging that this body of work is uneven in quality, Andsnes believes that the common critical dismissal is unwarranted. In performing selected piano works, Andsnes finds that audiences were &quot;astonished that there could be a major composer out there with such beautiful, accessible music that people don&#x27;t know&quot;.

For the 150th anniversary of Sibelius&#x27;s birth, the Helsinki Music Centre planned a daily illustrated and narrated &quot;Sibelius Finland Experience Show&quot; during the summer of 2015, also planned to extend into 2016 and 2017. On 8 December, the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by John Storgårds planned a commemorative concert featuring &quot;En Saga&quot;, &quot;Luonnotar&quot; and the Seventh Symphony.

==Legacy==

In 1972, Sibelius&#x27;s surviving daughters sold Ainola to the Finnish state. The Ministry of Education and the Sibelius Society of Finland opened it as a museum in 1974. Sibelius has been memorialized by art, stamps, and currency; the Finnish 100 mark bill featured his image until 2002 when the euro was adopted. Since 2011, Finland has celebrated a flag flying day on 8 December, the composer&#x27;s birthday, also known as the &quot;Day of Finnish Music&quot;. The year 2015, the 150th anniversary of the composer&#x27;s birth, featured a number of special concerts and events, especially in the city of Helsinki.

The quinquennial International Jean Sibelius Violin Competition, instituted in 1965, the Sibelius Monument, unveiled in 1967 in Helsinki&#x27;s Sibelius Park, the Sibelius Museum, opened in Turku in 1968, and the Sibelius Hall concert hall in Lahti, opened in 2000, were all named in his honour, as was the asteroid 1405 Sibelius.

The complete edition of Sibelius&#x27;s œuvre has been in preparation in Finland since 1996. It is a joint venture between the National Library of Finland, the Sibelius Society of Finland, and Breitkopf &amp; Härtel publishers. When finished, this critical edition will comprise 60 volumes.

Sibelius kept a diary from 1909 to 1944, and his family allowed it to be published, unabridged, in 2005. The diary was edited by and published in the Swedish language in 2005. To celebrate the 150th anniversary of the composer, the entire diary was also published in the Finnish language in 2015. Several volumes of Sibelius&#x27;s correspondence have also been edited and published in Swedish, Finnish and English.

The legacy of Sibelius is celebrated through an array of statues, monuments, parks, and similar honours. Among the most well known is the Sibelius Monument, a renowned piece of sculpture in its own right, located in the capital of Finland, Helsinki. It is surrounded by the eponymous park, which is among the most visited sites by sightseers visiting the city.

The scorewriter program Sibelius is named after him.

==Manuscripts==
Parts of the literary estate of Sibelius—correspondence and manuscripts—are preserved at the National Archives of Finland and National Library of Finland, but several items are in foreign private collections, even as investments, only partially accessible for scholars.

In 1970, a lot of 50 music manuscript items was acquired by the National Library with aid from the government of Finland, banks and foundations. Sibelius&#x27;s personal music archive was donated to the National Library in 1982 by the heirs of the composer.

Another lot of 50 items was procured in 1997, with aid from the Ministry of Education. In 2018, the Italian-Finnish collector and benefactor Rolando Pieraccini donated a collection of Sibelius&#x27;s letters and other materials to the National Museum of Finland. On the other hand, in 2016 the manuscript of &quot;Pohjola&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was sold to an anonymous buyer for 290,000 euros, and it is no longer available to scholars.

In early 2020, the current owner of the Robert Lienau collection offered for sale 1,200 pages of manuscripts, including the scores of &quot;Voces intimae&quot;, &quot;Joutsikki&quot;, and &quot;Pelléas and Mélisande&quot;, and the material was not available to scholars during negotiations. The original price tag was said to be over one million euros for the lot as a whole. At the end of the year, the National Library was able to acquire this collection with aid from foundations and donors. The final price was &quot;considerably below one million euros.&quot;

Nowadays, it is not legally possible to export Sibelius&#x27;s manuscripts from Finland without permission, and, according to &quot;Hufvudstadsbladet&quot;, such permission would probably not be given.

In 2021, the music manuscripts of Sibelius were included in the Memory of the World Programme by the UNESCO.

<text>Johan August Strindberg (; ; 22 January 184914 May 1912) was a Swedish playwright, novelist, poet, essayist, and painter. A prolific writer who often drew directly on his personal experience, Strindberg wrote more than 60 plays and more than 30 works of fiction, autobiography, history, cultural analysis, and politics during his career, which spanned four decades. A bold experimenter and iconoclast throughout his life, he explored a wide range of dramatic methods and purposes, from naturalistic tragedy, monodrama, and historical plays to his anticipations of expressionist and surrealist dramatic techniques. From his earliest work, Strindberg developed innovative forms of dramatic action, language, and visual composition. He is considered the &quot;father&quot; of modern Swedish literature and his &quot;The Red Room&quot; (1879) has frequently been described as the first modern Swedish novel. In Sweden, Strindberg is known as an essayist, painter, poet, and especially novelist and playwright, but in other countries he is known mostly as a playwright.

The Royal Theatre rejected his first major play, &quot;Master Olof&quot;, in 1872; it was not until 1881, when he was thirty-two, that its première at the New Theatre gave him his theatrical breakthrough. In his plays &quot;The Father&quot; (1887), &quot;Miss Julie&quot; (1888), and &quot;Creditors&quot; (1889), he created naturalistic dramas that – building on the established accomplishments of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s prose problem plays while rejecting their use of the structure of the well-made play – responded to the call-to-arms of Émile Zola&#x27;s manifesto &quot;Naturalism in the Theatre&quot; (1881) and the example set by André Antoine&#x27;s newly established (opened 1887). In &quot;Miss Julie&quot;, characterisation replaces plot as the predominant dramatic element (in contrast to melodrama and the well-made play) and the determining role of heredity and the environment on the &quot;vacillating, disintegrated&quot; characters is emphasized. Strindberg modeled his short-lived Scandinavian Experimental Theatre (1889) in Copenhagen on Antoine&#x27;s theatre and he explored the theory of Naturalism in his essays &quot;On Psychic Murder&quot; (1887), &quot;On Modern Drama and the Modern Theatre&quot; (1889), and a preface to &quot;Miss Julie&quot;, the last of which is probably the best-known statement of the principles of the theatrical movement.

During the 1890s he spent significant time abroad engaged in scientific experiments and studies of the occult. A series of apparent psychotic attacks between 1894 and 1896 (referred to as his &quot;&quot;Inferno&quot; crisis&quot;) led to his hospitalization and return to Sweden. Under the influence of the ideas of Emanuel Swedenborg, he resolved after his recovery to become &quot;the Zola of the Occult&quot;. In 1898 he returned to play-writing with &quot;To Damascus&quot;, which, like &quot;The Great Highway&quot; (1909), is a dream-play of spiritual pilgrimage. His &quot;A Dream Play&quot; (1902) – with its radical attempt to dramatize the workings of the unconscious by means of an abolition of conventional dramatic time and space and the splitting, doubling, merging, and multiplication of its characters – was an important precursor to both expressionism and surrealism. He also returned to writing historical drama, the genre with which he had begun his play-writing career. He helped to run the Intimate Theatre from 1907, a small-scale theatre in Stockholm, modeled on Max Reinhardt&#x27;s , that staged his chamber plays (such as &quot;The Ghost Sonata&quot;).

==Biography==

===Youth===
Strindberg was born on 22 January 1849 in Stockholm, Sweden, the third surviving son of Carl Oscar Strindberg (a shipping agent) and Eleonora Ulrika Norling (a serving-maid). In his autobiographical novel &quot;The Son of a Servant&quot;, Strindberg describes a childhood affected by &quot;emotional insecurity, poverty, religious fanaticism and neglect&quot;. When he was seven, the family moved to Norrtullsgatan on the northern, almost-rural, periphery of the city. A year later they moved near Sabbatsberg, where they stayed for three years before returning to Norrtullsgatan. He attended a harsh school in Klara for four years, an experience that haunted him in his adult life. He was moved to the school in Jakob in 1860, which he found far more pleasant, though he remained there for only a year. In the autumn of 1861, he was moved to the Stockholm Lyceum, a progressive private school for middle-class boys, where he remained for six years. As a child he had a keen interest in natural science, photography, and religion (following his mother&#x27;s Pietism). His mother, Strindberg recalled later with bitterness, always resented her son&#x27;s intelligence. She died when he was 13, and although his grief lasted for only three months, in later life he came to feel a sense of loss and longing for an idealized maternal figure. Less than a year after her death, his father married the children&#x27;s governess, Emilia Charlotta Pettersson. According to his sisters, Strindberg came to regard them as his worst enemies. He passed his graduation examination in May 1867 and enrolled at the Uppsala University, where he began on 13 September.

Strindberg spent the next few years in Uppsala and Stockholm, alternately studying for examinations and trying his hand at non-academic pursuits. As a young student, Strindberg also worked as an assistant in a pharmacy in the university town of Lund in southern Sweden. He supported himself in between studies as a substitute primary-school teacher and as a tutor for the children of two well-known physicians in Stockholm. He first left Uppsala in 1868 to work as a schoolteacher, but then studied chemistry for some time at the Institute of Technology in Stockholm in preparation for medical studies, later working as a private tutor before becoming an extra at the Royal Theatre in Stockholm. In May 1869, he failed his qualifying chemistry examination which in turn made him uninterested in schooling.

===1870s===
Strindberg returned to Uppsala University in January 1870 to study aesthetics and modern languages and to work on a number of plays. It was at this time that he first learnt about the ideas of Charles Darwin. He co-founded the Rune Society, a small literary club whose members adopted pseudonyms taken from runes of the ancient Teutonic alphabet – Strindberg called himself Frö (Seed), after the god of fertility. After abandoning a draft of a play about Eric XIV of Sweden halfway through in the face of criticism from the Rune Society, on 30 March he completed a one-act comedy in verse called &quot;In Rome&quot; about Bertel Thorvaldsen, which he had begun the previous autumn. The play was accepted by the Royal Theatre, where it premièred on 13 September 1870. As he watched it performed, he realised that it was not good and felt like drowning himself, though the reviews published the following day were generally favourable. That year he also first read works of Søren Kierkegaard and Georg Brandes, both of whom influenced him.
Taking his cue from William Shakespeare, he began to use colloquial and realistic speech in his historical dramas, which challenged the convention that they should be written in stately verse. During the Christmas holiday of 1870–71, he rewrote a historical tragedy, &quot;Sven the Sacrificer&quot;, as a one-act play in prose called &quot;The Outlaw&quot;. Depressed by Uppsala, he stayed in Stockholm, returning to the university in April to pass an exam in Latin and in June to defend his thesis on Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger&#x27;s Romantic tragedy &quot;Earl Haakon&quot; (1802). Following further revision in the summer, &quot;The Outlaw&quot; opened at the Royal Theatre on 16 October 1871. Despite hostile reviews, the play earned him an audience with King Charles XV, who supported his studies with a payment of 200 riksdaler. Towards the end of the year Strindberg completed a first draft of his first major work, a play about Olaus Petri called &quot;Master Olof&quot;. In September 1872, the Royal Theatre rejected it, leading to decades of rewrites, bitterness, and a contempt for official institutions. Returning to the university for what would be his final term in the spring, he left on 2 March 1872, without graduating. In &quot;Town and Gown&quot; (1877), a collection of short stories describing student life, he ridiculed Uppsala and its professors.

Strindberg embarked on his career as a journalist and critic for newspapers in Stockholm. He was particularly excited at this time by Henry Thomas Buckle&#x27;s &quot;History of Civilization&quot; and the first volume of Georg Brandes&#x27; &quot;Main Currents of Nineteenth-Century Literature&quot;. From December 1874, Strindberg worked for eight years as an assistant librarian at the Royal Library. That same month, Strindberg offered &quot;Master Olof&quot; to Edvard Stjernström (the director of the newly built New Theatre in Stockholm), but it was rejected. He socialised with writers, painters, journalists, and other librarians; they often met in the Red Room in Bern&#x27;s Restaurant.

Early in the summer of 1875, he met Siri von Essen, a 24-year-old aspiring actress who, by virtue of her husband, was a baroness – he became infatuated with her. Strindberg described himself as a &quot;failed author&quot; at this time: &quot;I feel like a deaf-mute,&quot; he wrote, &quot;as I cannot speak and am not permitted to write; sometimes I stand in the middle of my room that seems like a prison cell, and then I want to scream so that walls and ceilings would fly apart, and I have so much to scream about, and therefore I remain silent.&quot; As a result of an argument in January 1876 concerning the inheritance of the family firm, Strindberg&#x27;s relationship with his father was terminated (he did not attend his funeral in February 1883). From the beginning of 1876, Strindberg and Siri began to meet in secret, and that same year Siri and her husband divorced. Following a successful audition that December, Siri became an actress at the Royal Theatre. They married a year later, on 30 December 1877; Siri was seven months pregnant at the time. Their first child was born prematurely on 21 January 1878 and died two days later. On 9 January 1879, Strindberg was declared bankrupt. In November 1879, his novel &quot;The Red Room&quot; was published. A satire of Stockholm society, it has frequently been described as the first modern Swedish novel. While receiving mixed reviews in Sweden, it was acclaimed in Denmark, where Strindberg was hailed as a genius. As a result of &quot;The Red Room&quot;, he had become famous throughout Scandinavia. Edvard Brandes wrote that the novel &quot;makes the reader want to join the fight against hypocrisy and reaction.&quot; In his response to Brandes, Strindberg explained that:

===1880s===

Strindberg and Siri&#x27;s daughter Karin was born on 26 February 1880. Buoyant from the reception of &quot;The Red Room&quot;, Strindberg swiftly completed &quot;The Secret of the Guild&quot;, an historical drama set in Uppsala at the beginning of the 15th century about the conflict between two masons over the completion of the city cathedral, which opened at the Royal Theatre on 3 May 1880 (his first première in nine years); Siri played Margaretha. That spring he formed a friendship with the painter Carl Larsson. A collected edition of all of Strindberg&#x27;s previous writings was published under the title &quot;Spring Harvest&quot;. From 1881, at the invitation of Edvard Brandes, Strindberg began to contribute articles to the &quot;Morgenbladet&quot;, a Copenhagen daily newspaper. In April he began work on &quot;The Swedish People&quot;, a four-part cultural history of Sweden written as a series of depictions of ordinary people&#x27;s lives from the 9th century onwards, which he undertook mainly for financial reasons and which absorbed him for the next year; Larsson provided illustrations. At Strindberg&#x27;s insistence, Siri resigned from the Royal Theatre in the spring, having become pregnant again. Their second daughter, Greta, was born on 9 June 1881, while they were staying on the island of Kymmendö. That month, a collection of essays from the past 10 years, &quot;Studies in Cultural History&quot;, was published. Ludvig Josephson (the new artistic director of Stockholm&#x27;s New Theatre) agreed to stage &quot;Master Olof&quot;, eventually opting for the prose version – the five-hour-long production opened on 30 December 1881 under the direction of August Lindberg to favourable reviews. While this production of &quot;Master Olof&quot; was his breakthrough in the theatre, Strindberg&#x27;s five-act fairy-tale play &quot;Lucky Peter&#x27;s Journey&quot;, which opened on 22 December 1883, brought him his first significant success, although he dismissed it as a potboiler. In March 1882 he wrote in a letter to Josephson: &quot;My interest in the theatre, I must frankly state, has but one focus and one goal – my wife&#x27;s career as an actress&quot;; Josephson duly cast her in two roles the following season.

Having returned to Kymmendö during the summer of 1882, Strindberg wrote a collection of anti-establishment short stories, &quot;The New Kingdom&quot;. While there, to provide a lead role for his wife and as a reply to Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; (1879), he also wrote &quot;Sir Bengt&#x27;s Wife&quot;, which opened on 25 November 1882 at the New Theatre. He moved to Grez-sur-Loing, just south of Paris, France, where Larsson was staying. He then moved to Paris, which they found noisy and polluted. Income earned from &quot;Lucky Peter&#x27;s Journey&quot; enabled him to move to Switzerland in 1883. He resided in Ouchy, where he stayed for some years. On 3 April 1884, Siri gave birth to their son, Hans.
In 1884 Strindberg wrote a collection of short stories, &quot;Getting Married&quot;, that presented women in an egalitarian light and for which he was tried for and acquitted of blasphemy in Sweden. Two groups &quot;led by influential members of the upper classes, supported by the right-wing press&quot; probably instigated the prosecution; at the time, most people in Stockholm thought that Queen Sophia was behind it. By the end of that year Strindberg was in a despondent mood: &quot;My view now is,&quot; he wrote, &quot;everything is shit. No way out. The skein is too tangled to be unravelled. It can only be sheared. The building is too solid to be pulled down. It can only be blown up.&quot; In May 1885 he wrote: &quot;I am on my way to becoming an atheist.&quot; In the wake of the publication of &quot;Getting Married&quot;, he began to correspond with Émile Zola. During the summer he completed a sequel volume of stories, though some were quite different in tone from those of the first. Another collection of stories, &quot;Utopias in Reality&quot;, was published in September 1885, though it was not well received.

In 1885, they moved back to Paris. In September 1887 he began to write a novel in French about his relationship with Siri von Essen called &quot;The Defence of a Fool&quot;. In 1887, they moved to Issigatsbühl, near Lindau by Lake Constance. His next play, &quot;Comrades&quot; (1886), was his first in a contemporary setting. After the trial he evaluated his religious beliefs, and concluded that he needed to leave Lutheranism, though he had been Lutheran since childhood; and after briefly being a deist, he became an atheist. He needed a credo and he used Jean-Jacques Rousseau nature worshiping, which he had studied while a student, as one. His works &quot;The People of Hemsö&quot; (1887) and &quot;Among French Peasants&quot; (1889) were influenced by his study of Rousseau. He then moved to Germany, where he fell in love with Chancellor Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s Prussia status of the officer corps. After that, he grew very critical of Rousseau and turned to Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophies, which emphasized the male intellect. Nietzsche&#x27;s influence can be seen in &quot;The Defence of a Fool&quot; (1893), &quot;Pariah&quot; (1889), &quot;Creditors&quot; (1889), and &quot;By the Open Sea&quot; (1890).

Another change in his life after the trial is that Strindberg decided he wanted a scientific life instead of a literary one, and began to write about non-literary subjects. When he was 37, he began &quot;The Son of a Servant&quot;, a four-part autobiography. The first part ends in 1867, the year he left home for Uppsala. Part two describes his youth up to 1872. Part three, or &quot;The Red Room&quot;, describes his years as a poet and journalist; it ends with his meeting Siri von Essen. Part four, which dealt with the years from 1877 to 1886, was banned by his publishers and was not published until after his death. The three missing years, 1875–1877, were the time when Strindberg was wooing von Essen and their marriage; entitled &quot;He and She&quot;, this portion of his autobiography was not printed until 1919, after his death. It contains the love letters between the two during that period.

In the later half of the 1880s Strindberg discovered Naturalism. After completing &quot;The Father&quot; in a matter of weeks, he sent a copy to Émile Zola for his approval, though Zola&#x27;s reaction was lukewarm. The drama revolves around the conflict between the Captain, a father, husband, and scientist, and his wife, Laura, over the education of their only child, a fourteen-year-old daughter named Berta. Through unscrupulous means, Laura gets the Captain to doubt his fatherhood until he suffers a mental and physical collapse. While writing &quot;The Father&quot;, Strindberg himself was experiencing marital problems and doubted the paternity of his children. He also suspected that Ibsen had based Hjalmar Ekdal in &quot;The Wild Duck&quot; (1884) on Strindberg because he felt that Ibsen viewed him as a weak and pathetic husband; he reworked the situation of Ibsen&#x27;s play into a warfare between the two sexes. From November 1887 to April 1889, Strindberg stayed in Copenhagen. While there he had several opportunities to meet with both Georg Brandes and his brother Edvard Brandes. Georg helped him put on &quot;The Father&quot;, which had its première on 14 November 1887 at the Casino Theatre in Copenhagen. It enjoyed a successful run for 11 days after which it toured the Danish provinces.
Before writing &quot;Creditors&quot;, Strindberg completed one of his most famous pieces, &quot;Miss Julie&quot;. He wrote the play with a Parisian stage in mind, in particular the Théâtre Libre, founded in 1887 by André Antoine. In the play he used Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of survival of the fittest and dramatized a doomed sexual encounter that crosses the division of social classes. It is believed that this play was inspired by the marriage of Strindberg, the son of a servant, to an aristocratic woman.

In the essay &quot;On Psychic Murder&quot; (1887), he referred to the psychological theories of the Nancy School, which advocated the use of hypnosis. Strindberg developed a theory that sexual warfare was not motivated by carnal desire but by relentless human will. The winner was the one who had the strongest and most unscrupulous mind, someone who, like a hypnotist, could coerce a more impressionable psyche into submission. His view on psychological power struggles may be seen in works such as &quot;Creditors&quot; (1889), &quot;The Stronger&quot; (1889), and &quot;Pariah&quot; (1889).

In 1888, after a separation and reconciliation with Siri von Essen, he founded the Scandinavian Experimental Theatre in Copenhagen, where Siri became manager. He asked writers to send him scripts, which he received from Herman Bang, Gustav Wied and Nathalia Larsen. Less than a year later, with the theatre and reconciliation short lived, he moved back to Sweden while Siri moved back to her native Finland with the children. While there, he rode out the final phase of the divorce and later used this agonizing ordeal for the basis of &quot;The Bond and the Link&quot; (1893). Strindberg also became interested in short drama, called Quart d&#x27;heure. He was inspired by writers such as Gustave Guiche and Henri de Lavedan. His notable contribution was &quot;The Stronger&quot; (1889). As a result of the failure of the Scandinavian Experimental Theatre, Strindberg did not work as a playwright for three years. In 1889, he published an essay entitled &quot;On Modern Drama and the Modern Theatre&quot;, in which he disassociated himself from naturalism, arguing that it was petty and unimaginative realism. His sympathy for Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy and atheism in general was also on the wane. He entered the period of his &quot;Inferno crisis&quot;, in which he had psychological and religious upheavals that influenced his later works.

August Strindberg&#x27;s Inferno is his personal account of sinking deeper into some kind of madness, typified by visions and paranoia. In &quot;Strindberg och alkoholen&quot; (1985), James Spens discusses Strindberg&#x27;s drinking habits, including his liking for absinthe and its possible implications for Strindberg&#x27;s mental health during the inferno period.

===1890s===

On midsummer&#x27;s day, 1891, while staying with Siri and her close friend, the Danish woman Marie Caroline David, on the island Runmarö, in the Stockholm Archipelago, Strindberg suspected Siri was having a long-term affair with David, and he violently assaulted her, precipitating the end of the marriage. 

After his disenchantment with naturalism, Strindberg had a growing interest in transcendental matters. Symbolism was just beginning at this time. Verner von Heidenstam and Ola Hanson had dismissed naturalism as &quot;shoemaker realism&quot; that rendered human experience in simplistic terms. This is believed to have stalled Strindberg&#x27;s creativity, and Strindberg insisted that he was in a rivalry and forced to defend naturalism, even though he had exhausted its literary potential. These works include: &quot;Debit and Credit&quot; (1892), &quot;Facing Death&quot; (1892), &quot;Motherly Love&quot; (1892), and &quot;The First Warning&quot; (1893). His play &quot;The Keys of Heaven&quot; (1892) was inspired by the loss of his children in his divorce. He also completed one of his few comedies, &quot;Playing with Fire&quot; (1893), and the first two parts of his post-inferno trilogy &quot;To Damascus&quot; (1898–1904).

In 1892, he experienced writer&#x27;s block, which led to a drastic reduction in his income. Depression followed as he was unable to meet his financial obligations and to support his children and former wife. A fund was set up through an appeal in a German magazine. This money allowed him to leave Sweden and he joined artistic circles in Berlin. Otto Brahm&#x27;s Freie Bühne theatre premiered some of his famous works in Germany, including &quot;The Father&quot;, &quot;Miss Julie&quot;, and &quot;Creditors&quot;.

Similar to 20 years earlier when he frequented The Red Room, he now went to the German tavern The Black Porker. Here he met a diverse group of artists from Scandinavia, Poland, and Germany. His attention turned to Frida Uhl, who was twenty-three years younger than Strindberg. They were married in 1893. Less than a year later, their daughter Kerstin was born and the couple separated, though their marriage was not officially dissolved until 1897. Frida&#x27;s family, in particular her mother, who was a devout Catholic, had an important influence on Strindberg, and in an 1894 letter he declared &quot;I feel the hand of our Lord resting over me.&quot;

Some critics think that Strindberg suffered from severe paranoia in the mid-1890s, and perhaps that he temporarily experienced insanity. Others, including Evert Sprinchorn and Olof Lagercrantz, believed that he intentionally turned himself into his own guinea pig by doing psychological and drug-induced self-experimentation. He wrote on subjects such as botany, chemistry, and optics before returning to literature with the publication of &quot;Inferno&quot; (1897), a (half fictionalized) account of his &quot;wilderness years&quot; in Austria and Paris, then a collection of short stories, &quot;Legends&quot;, and a semi-dramatic novella, &quot;Jacob Wrestling&quot; (both printed in the same book 1898). Both volumes aroused curiosity and controversy, not least due to the religious element; earlier, Strindberg had been known to be indifferent or hostile to religion and especially priests, but now he had undergone some sort of conversion to a personal faith. In a postscript, he noted the impact of Emanuel Swedenborg on his current work.
&quot;The Powers&quot; were central to Strindberg&#x27;s later work. He said that &quot;the Powers&quot; were an outside force that had caused him his physical and mental suffering because they were acting in retribution to humankind for their wrongdoings. As William Blake, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Honoré de Balzac, and William Butler Yeats had been, he was drawn to Swedenborg&#x27;s mystical visions, with their depictions of spiritual landscape and Christian morality. Strindberg believed for the rest of his life that the relationship between the transcendental and the real world was described by a series of &quot;correspondences&quot; and that everyday events were really messages from above of which only the enlightened could make sense. He also felt that he was chosen by Providence to atone for the moral decay of others and that his tribulations were payback for misdeeds earlier in his life.

Strindberg had spent the tail end of 1896 and most of 1897 in the university town of Lund in southern Sweden, a sojourn during which he made a number of new friendships, felt his mental stability and health improving and also firmly returned to literary writing; &quot;Inferno, Legends&quot; and &quot;Jacob Wrestling&quot; were written there. In 1899, he returned permanently to Stockholm, following a successful production there of &quot;Master Olof&quot; in 1897 (which was re-staged in 1899 to mark Strindberg&#x27;s fiftieth birthday). He had the desire to become recognized as a leadíng figure in Swedish literature, and to put earlier controversies behind him, and felt that historical dramas were the way to attain that status. Though Strindberg claimed that he was writing &quot;realistically&quot;, he freely altered past events and biographical information, and telescoped chronology (as often done in most historical fiction): more importantly, he felt a flow of resurgent inspiration, writing almost twenty new plays (many in a historical setting) between 1898 and 1902. His new works included the so-called Vasa Trilogy: &quot;The Saga of the Folkungs&quot; (1899), &quot;Gustavus Vasa&quot; (1899), and &quot;Erik XIV&quot; (1899) and &quot;A Dream Play&quot; (written in 1901, first performed in 1907).

===1900s===

Strindberg was pivotal in the creation of chamber plays. Max Reinhardt was a big supporter of his, staging some of his plays at the Kleines Theatre in 1902 (including &quot;The Bond&quot;, &quot;The Stronger&quot;, and &quot;The Outlaw&quot;). Once Otto Brahm relinquished his role as head as of the Deutsches Theatre, Reinhardt took over and produced Strindberg&#x27;s plays.

In 1903, Strindberg planned to write a grand cycle of plays based on world history, but the idea soon faded. He had completed short plays about Martin Luther, Plato, Moses, Jesus Christ, and Socrates. He wrote another historical drama in 1908 after the Royal Theatre convinced him to put on a new play for its sixtieth birthday. He wrote &quot;The Last of the Knights&quot; (1908), &quot;Earl Birger of Bjälbo&quot; (1909), and &quot;The Regents&quot; (1909).
His other works, such as &quot;Days of Loneliness&quot; (1903), &quot;The Roofing Ceremony&quot; (1907), and &quot;The Scapegoat&quot; (1907), and the novels &quot;The Gothic Rooms&quot; (1904) and &quot;Black Banners Genre Scenes from the Turn of the Century&quot;, (1907) have been viewed as precursors to Marcel Proust and Franz Kafka.

August Falck, an actor, wanted to put on a production of &quot;Miss Julie&quot; and wrote to Strindberg for permission. In September 1906 he staged the first Swedish production of &quot;Miss Julie&quot;. August Falck, played Jean and Manda Bjorling played Julie.

In 1909, Strindberg thought he might get the Nobel Prize in Literature, but instead lost to Selma Lagerlöf, the first woman and first Swede to win the award. The leader of the Social Democrat Youth Alliance started a fund-raiser for a special &quot;people&#x27;s award&quot;. Nathan Söderblom (friend of Strindberg since the mid-90s years in Paris, a prominent theologian and later to become archbishop of Sweden) was noted as a donor, and both he and Strindberg came under attack from circles close to the conservative party and the church. In total 45,000 Swedish crowns were collected, by more than 20,000 donors, most of whom were workers. Albert Bonniers förlag, who had already published much of his work over the years, paid him 200,000 Swedish crowns for the publishing rights to his complete works; the first volumes of the edition would appear in print in 1912, a few months before his death. He invited his first three children (now, like their mother, living in Finland) to Stockholm and divided the money into five shares, one for each child, one for Siri (absent), and the last one for himself. In setting apart one share for Siri, Strindberg noted, in a shy voice, &quot;This is for your mother - it&#x27;s to settle an old debt&quot;. When the children returned to Helsinki, Siri was surprised to hear that she had been included, but accepted the money and told them in a voice that was, according to her daughter Karin, both proud and moved, &quot;I shall accept it, receiving it as an old debt&quot;. The debt was less financial than mental and emotional; Strindberg knew he had sometimes treated her unfairly during the later years of their marriage and at their divorce trial. In 1912, she would pass away only a few weeks before him.

In 1907, Strindberg co-founded The Intimate Theatre in Stockholm, together with the young actor and stage director August Falck. His theatre was modeled after Max Reinhardt&#x27;s Kammerspiel Haus. Strindberg and Falck had the intention of the theatre being used for his plays and his plays only, Strindberg also wanted to try out a more chamber-oriented and sparse style of dramatic writing and production. In time for the theatre&#x27;s opening, Strindberg wrote four chamber plays: &quot;Thunder in the Air, The Burned Site, The Ghost Sonata&quot;, and &quot;The Pelican&quot;; these were generally not a success with audiences or newspaper critics at the time but have been highly influential on modern drama (and soon would reach wider audiences at Reinhardt&#x27;s theatre in Berlin and other German stages). Strindberg had very specific ideas about how the theatre would be opened and operated. He drafted a series of rules for his theatre in a letter to August Falck: 1. No liquor. 2. No Sunday performances. 3. Short performances without intermissions. 4. No calls. 5. Only 160 seats in the auditorium. 6. No prompter. No orchestra, only music on stage. 7. The text will be sold at the box office and in the lobby. 8. Summer performances. Falck helped to design the auditorium, which was decorated in a deep-green tone. The ceiling lighting was a yellow silk cover which created an effect of mild daylight. The floor was covered with a deep-green carpet, and the auditorium was decorated by six ultra modern columns with elaborate up-to-date capitals. Instead of the usual restaurant Strindberg offered a lounge for the ladies and a smoking-room for the gentlemen. The stage was unusually small, only 6 by 9 metres. The small stage and minimal number of seats was meant to give the audience a greater feeling of involvement in the work. Unlike most theatres at this time, the Intima Teater was not a place in which people could come to socialize. By setting up his rules and creating an intimate atmosphere, Strindberg was able to demand the audience&#x27;s focus. When the theatre opened in 1907 with a performance of &quot;The Pelican&quot; it was a rather large hit. Strindberg used a minimal technique, as was his way, by only having a back drop and some sea shells on the stage for scene design and props. Strindberg was much more concerned with the actors portraying the written word than the stage looking pretty. The theatre ran into a financial difficulty in February 1908 and Falck had to borrow money from Prince Eugen, Duke of Närke, who attended the première of &quot;The Pelican&quot;. The theatre eventually went bankrupt in 1910, but did not close until Strindberg&#x27;s death in 1912. The newspapers wrote about the theatre until its death.

===Death and funeral===

Strindberg died shortly after the first staging of one of his plays in the United States — &quot;The Father&quot; opened on 9 April 1912 at the Berkeley Theatre in New York, in a translation by painter and playwright Edith Gardener Shearn Oland and her husband actor Warner Oland. They jointly published their translations of his plays in book form in 1912.

During Christmas 1911, Strindberg became sick with pneumonia and he never recovered completely. He also began to suffer more clearly from a stomach cancer (early signs of which had been felt in 1908). The final weeks of his life were painful. He had long since become a national celebrity, even if highly controversial, and when it became clear that he was seriously ill the daily papers in Stockholm began reporting on his health in every edition. He received many letters and telegrams from admirers across the country. He died on 14 May 1912 at the age of 63.

Strindberg was interred at Norra begravningsplatsen in Stockholm. He had given strict instructions concerning his funeral and how his body should be treated after death: only members of his immediate family were allowed to view his body, there would be no autopsy, no photographs were taken, and no death mask was made. Strindberg had also requested that his funeral should take place as soon as possible after his death to avoid crowds of onlookers. However, the workers&#x27; organisations requested that the funeral should take place on a Sunday to make it possible for working men to pay their respects, and the funeral was postponed for five days, until Sunday, 19 May. According to Strindberg&#x27;s last wish, the funeral procession was to start at 8am, again to avoid crowds, but large groups of people were nevertheless waiting outside his home as well as at the cemetery, as early as 7am. A short service was conducted by Nathan Söderblom by the bier in Strindberg&#x27;s home, in the presence of three of Strindberg&#x27;s children and his housekeeper, after which the coffin was taken outside for the funeral procession. The procession was followed by groups of students, workers, members of Parliament and a couple of cabinet ministers, and it was estimated that up to 60,000 people lined the streets. King Gustaf V sent a wreath for the bier.

==Legacy==
Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, Maxim Gorky, John Osborne, and Ingmar Bergman are among the many artists who have cited Strindberg as an influence. Eugene O&#x27;Neill, upon receiving the Nobel Prize in Literature, dedicated much of his acceptance speech to describing Strindberg&#x27;s influence on his work, and referred to him as &quot;that greatest genius of all modern dramatists.&quot; Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges said of Strindberg: &quot;[he] was, for a time, my god, alongside Nietzsche&quot;.

A multi-faceted author, Strindberg&#x27;s novel &quot;The Red Room&quot; (1879) made him famous. His early plays belong to the Naturalistic movement. His works from this time are often compared with the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. Strindberg&#x27;s best-known play from this period is &quot;Miss Julie&quot;. Among his most widely read works is the novel &quot;The People of Hemsö&quot;.

Strindberg wanted to attain what he called &quot;greater Naturalism&quot;. He disliked the expository character backgrounds that characterise the work of Henrik Ibsen and rejected the convention of a dramatic &quot;slice of life&quot; because he felt that the resulting plays were mundane and uninteresting. Strindberg felt that true naturalism was a psychological &quot;battle of brains&quot;: two people who hate each other in the immediate moment and strive to drive the other to doom is the type of mental hostility that Strindberg strove to describe. He intended his plays to be impartial and objective, citing a desire to make literature akin to a science.

Following the inner turmoil that he experienced during the &quot;Inferno crisis&quot;, he wrote an important book in French, &quot;Inferno&quot; (1896–7), in which he dramatised his experiences. He also exchanged a few cryptic letters with Friedrich Nietzsche.

Strindberg subsequently ended his association with Naturalism and began to produce works informed by Symbolism. He is considered one of the pioneers of the modern European stage and Expressionism. &quot;The Dance of Death&quot;, &quot;A Dream Play&quot;, and &quot;The Ghost Sonata&quot; are well-known plays from this period.

His most famous and produced plays are &quot;Master Olof&quot;, &quot;Miss Julie&quot;, and &quot;The Father&quot;.

Internationally, Strindberg is chiefly remembered as a playwright, but in his native Sweden his name is associated no less with novels and other writings. &quot;Röda rummet&quot; (The Red Room), &quot;Hemsöborna&quot; (The People of Hemsö), &quot;Giftas&quot; (Getting Married), &quot;En dåres försvarstal&quot; (The Confession of a Fool), and &quot;Inferno&quot; remain among his most celebrated novels, representing different genres and styles. He is often, though not universally, viewed as Sweden&#x27;s greatest author, and taught in schools as a key figure of Swedish culture. The most important contemporary literary award in Sweden, Augustpriset, is named for Strindberg.

The Swedish composer Ture Rangström dedicated his first Symphony, which was finished in 1914, to &quot;August Strindberg in memoriam&quot;.

==Social criticism==
An acerbic polemicist who was often vehemently opposed to conventional authority, Strindberg was difficult to pigeon-hole as a political figure. Through his long career, he penned scathing attacks on the military, the church, and the monarchy. For most of his public life, he was seen as a major figure on the literary left and a standard-bearer of cultural radicalism, but, especially from the 1890s, he espoused conservative and religious views that alienated many former supporters. He resumed his attacks on conservative society with great vigor in the years immediately preceding his death.

Strindberg&#x27;s opinions were typically stated with great force and vitriol, and sometimes humorously over-stated. He was involved in a variety of crises and feuds, skirmishing regularly with the literary and cultural establishment of his day, including erstwhile allies and friends. His youthful reputation as a genial &quot;enfant terrible&quot; of Swedish literature, transformed, eventually, into the role of a sort of ill-tempered towering giant of Swedish public life.

Strindberg was a prolific letter-writer, whose private communications have been collected in several annotated volumes. He often voiced political views privately to friends and literary acquaintances, phrased in a no-holds-barred jargon of scathing attacks, drastic humor, and flippant hyperbole. Many of his most controversial political statements are drawn from this private correspondence.

Influenced by the history of the 1871 Paris Commune, the young Strindberg had embraced the view that politics was the art of the upper class to keep the lower class under itself. Early works like the &quot;Red Room&quot; or &quot;Master Olof&quot; took aim at public hypocrisy, royalty, and organized religion. He was, at this time, an outspoken socialist, mainly influenced by anarchist or libertarian socialist ideas. However, Strindberg&#x27;s socialism was undogmatic and rooted in a ruthless critique of state, church, school, press, and economy in which he aimed at pitting the people against kings, economists, priests, and merchants. A small example from this period is his Little Catechism for the Underclass.

He read widely among progressive thinkers, including Cabet, Fourier, Babeuf, Saint-Simon, Proudhon, and Owen, whom he referred to as &quot;friends of humanity and sharp thinkers.&quot; &quot;Strindberg adopted ideas from everyone,&quot; writes Jan Olsson, who notes that Strindberg lived in a period where &quot;terms like anarchism, socialism, and communism were alternately used as synonyms and as different terms.&quot;

By the early 1880s, many young political and literary radicals in Sweden had come to view Strindberg as a champion of their causes. However, in contrast to the Marxist-influenced socialism then rising within the Swedish labor movement, Strindberg espoused an older type of agrarian radicalism accompanied by spiritual and even mystical ideas. His views remained as fluid and eclectic as they were uncompromising, and on certain issues he could be wildly out of step with the younger generation of socialists. To Martin Kylhammar, the young Strindberg &quot;was a &#x27;reactionary radical&#x27; whose writing was populist and democratic but who persisted in an antiquated romanticizing of agrarian life.&quot;

Although he had been an early proponent of women&#x27;s rights, calling for women&#x27;s suffrage in 1884, Strindberg later became disenchanted with what he viewed as an unnatural equation of the sexes. In times of personal conflict and marital trouble (which was much of the time), he could lash out with crudely misogynistic statements. His troubled marriage with Siri von Essen, ended in an upsetting divorce in 1891, became the inspiration for &quot;The Defence of a Fool&quot;, begun in 1887 and published in 1893. Strindberg famously sought to insert a warning to lawmakers against &quot;granting citizens&#x27; rights to half-apes, lower beings, sick children, [who are] sick and crazed thirteen times a year during their periods, completely insane while pregnant, and irresponsible throughout the rest of their lives.&quot; The paragraph was ultimately removed before printing by his publisher.

Strindberg&#x27;s misogyny was at odds with the younger generation of socialist activists and has drawn attention in contemporary Strindberg scholarship. So has Strindberg&#x27;s anti-Jewish rhetoric. Although particularly targeting Jewish enemies of his in Swedish cultural life, he also attacked Jews and Judaism as such. The antisemitic outbursts were particularly pronounced in the early 1880s, when Strindberg dedicated an entire chapter (&quot;Moses&quot;) in a work of social and political satire, &quot;Det nya riket&quot;, dedicated to heckling Swedish Jews (including an unflattering portrayal of Albert Bonnier). Although anti-Jewish prejudice was far from uncommon in wider society in the 1880s, Jan Myrdal notes that &quot;the entire liberal and democratic intelligentsia of the time distanced themselves from the older, left-wing antisemitism of August Strindberg.&quot; Yet, as with many things, Strindberg&#x27;s opinions and passions shifted with time. In the mid-1880s he toned down and then mostly ended his anti-Jewish rhetoric, after publicly declaring himself not to be an anti-Semite in 1884.
A self-declared atheist in his younger years, Strindberg would also re-embrace Christianity, without necessarily making his peace with the church. As noted by Stockholm&#x27;s Strindberg Museum, the personal and spiritual crisis that Strindberg underwent in Paris in the 1890s, which prompted the writing of &quot;Inferno&quot;, had aesthetic as well as philosophical and political implications: &quot;Before the Inferno crisis (1869 – 92), Strindberg was influenced by anarchism, Rousseau, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche; in the years after the crisis (1897 – 1911) he was influenced by Swedenborg, Goethe, Shakespeare, and Beethoven.&quot;

In &quot;Inferno&quot;, Strindberg notes his ideological and spiritual evolution:

 What is the purpose of having toiled through thirty years only to gain, through experience, that which I had already understood as a concept? In my youth, I was a sincere believer, and you [i.e. the powers that be] have made me a free-thinker. Out of a free-thinker you have made me an atheist; out of an atheist, a religious believer. Inspired by humanitarian ideas, I have praised socialism. Five years later, you have proven to me the unreasonableness of socialism. Everything that once enthralled me you have invalidated! And presuming that I will now abandon myself to religion, I am certain that you will, in ten years, disprove religion. (Strindberg, &quot;Inferno&quot;, Chapter XV.) 

Despite his reactionary attitudes on issues such as women&#x27;s rights and his conservative, mystical turn from the early 1890s, Strindberg remained popular with some in the socialist-liberal camp on the strength of his past radicalism and his continued salience as a literary modernizer. However, several former admirers were disappointed and troubled by what they viewed as Strindberg&#x27;s descent into religious conservatism and, perhaps, madness. His former ally and friend, Social Democrat leader Hjalmar Branting, now dismissed the author as a &quot;disaster&quot; who had betrayed his past ideals for a reactionary, mystical elitism. In 1909, Branting remarked on Strindberg&#x27;s shifting political and cultural posture, on the occasion of the author&#x27;s sixtieth birthday:

 To the young Strindberg, the trail-blazer, the rouser from sleep, let us offer all our praise and admiration. To the writer in a more mature age [let us offer] a place of rank on the Aeropagus of European erudition. But to the Strindberg of &quot;Black Banners&quot; [1907] and &quot;A Blue Book&quot; [1907-1912], who, in the shadows of &quot;Inferno&quot; [1898] has been converted to a belief in the sickly, empty gospels of mysticism – let us wish, from our hearts, that he may once again become his past self. (Hjalmar Branting, in &quot;Social-Demokraten&quot;, 22 January 1909.) 

Toward the end of his life, however, Strindberg would dramatically reassert his role as a radical standard-bearer and return to the good graces of progressive Swedish opinion.

In April 1910, Strindberg launched a series of unprompted, insult-laden attacks on popular conservative symbols, viciously thrashing the nationalist cult of former king Charles XII (&quot;pharao worship&quot;), the lauded poet Verner von Heidenstam (&quot;the spirit-seer of Djursholm&quot;), and the famous author and traveler Sven Hedin (&quot;the humbug explorer&quot;). The ensuing debate, known as &quot;Strindbergsfejden&quot; or &quot;The Strindberg Feud&quot;, is one of the most significant literary debates in Swedish history. It came to comprise about a thousand articles by various authors across some eighty newspapers, raging for two years until Strindberg&#x27;s death in 1912. The Feud served to revive Strindberg&#x27;s reputation as an implacable enemy of bourgeois tastes, while also reestablishing beyond doubt his centrality to Swedish culture and politics. In 1912, Strindberg&#x27;s funeral was co-organized by Branting and heavily attended by members of the Swedish labor movement, with &quot;more than 100 red banners&quot; in attendance alongside the entire Social Democrat parliamentary contingent.

Strindberg&#x27;s daughter Karin Strindberg married a Russian Bolshevik of partially Swedish ancestry, (&quot;Paulsson&quot;).

==Painting==
Strindberg, something of a polymath, was also a telegrapher, theosophist, painter, photographer and alchemist.

Painting and photography offered vehicles for his belief that chance played a crucial part in the creative process.

Strindberg&#x27;s paintings were unique for their time, and went beyond those of his contemporaries for their radical lack of adherence to visual reality. The 117 paintings that are acknowledged as his were mostly painted within the span of a few years, and are now seen by some as among the most original works of 19th-century art.

Today, his best-known pieces are stormy, expressionist seascapes, selling at high prices in auction houses. Though Strindberg was friends with Edvard Munch and Paul Gauguin, and was thus familiar with modern trends, the spontaneous and subjective expressiveness of his landscapes and seascapes can be ascribed also to the fact that he painted only in periods of personal crisis. Anders Zorn also did a portrait.


==Photography==
Strindberg&#x27;s interest in photography resulted, among other things, in a large number of arranged self-portraits in various environments, which now number among the best-known pictures of him. Strindberg also embarked on a series of camera-less images, using an experimental quasi-scientific approach. He produced a type of photogram that encouraged the development and growth of crystals on the photographic emulsion, sometimes exposed for lengthy periods to heat or cold in the open air or at night facing the stars. The suggestiveness of these, which he called Celestographs, provided an object for contemplation, and he noted;
His interest in the occult in the 1890s finds sympathy with the chance quality of these images, but for him they are also scientific.
In 1895 Strindberg met Camille Flammarion and became a member of the Société astronomique de France. He gave some of his experimental astronomical photographs to the Society.

==Occult studies==
Alchemy, occultism, Swedenborgianism, and various other eccentric interests were pursued by Strindberg with some intensity for periods of his life.

In the curious and experimental 1897 work &quot;Inferno&quot; – a dark, paranoid, and confusing tale of his time in Paris, written in French, which takes the form of an autobiographical journal – Strindberg, as the narrator, claims to have successfully performed alchemical experiments and cast black magic spells on his daughter. Much of &quot;Inferno&quot; indicates that the author suffered from paranoid delusions, as he writes of being stalked through Paris, haunted by evil forces, and targeted with mind-altering electric rays emitted by an &quot;infernal machine&quot; covertly installed in his hotel. It remains unclear to what extent the book represents a genuine attempt at autobiography or exaggerates for literary effect. Olof Lagercrantz has suggested that Strindberg staged and imagined elements of the crisis as material for his literary production.

==Personal life==
Strindberg was married three times, as follows:
* Siri von Essen: married 1877–1891 (14 years), 3 daughters (Karin Smirnov, Greta, and another who died in infancy), 1 son (Hans);
* Frida Uhl: married 1893–1895, (2 years) 1 daughter (Kerstin); and
* Harriet Bosse: married 1901–1904 (3 years), 1 daughter (Anne-Marie).

Strindberg was age 28 and Siri was 27 at the time of their marriage. He was 44 and Frida was 21 when they married, and he was 52 and Harriet was 23 when they married. Late during his life he met the young actress and painter Fanny Falkner (1890–1963) who was 41 years younger than Strindberg. She wrote a book which illuminates his last years, but the exact nature of their relationship is debated. He had a brief affair in Berlin with Dagny Juel before his marriage to Frida; it has been suggested that the news of her murder in 1901 was the reason he cancelled his honeymoon with his third wife, Harriet.

He was related to Nils Strindberg (a son of one of August&#x27;s cousins).

Strindberg&#x27;s relationships with women were troubled and have often been interpreted as misogynistic by contemporaries and modern readers. Marriage and families were under stress in Strindberg&#x27;s lifetime as Sweden industrialized and urbanized at a rapid pace. Problems of prostitution and poverty were debated among writers, critics and politicians. His early writing often dealt with the traditional roles of the sexes imposed by society, which he criticized as unjust.

Strindberg&#x27;s last home was Blå tornet in central Stockholm, where he lived from 1908 until 1912. It is now a museum, known as the Strindberg Museum, which is open to visitors. It contains numerous of Strindberg&#x27;s personal possessions including his piano. 

Of several statues and busts of him erected in Stockholm, the most prominent is Carl Eldh&#x27;s, erected in 1942 in Tegnérlunden, a park adjoining this house.

<doc id="49646" wikidata="Q3750514" url="?curid=49646" title="Sophist">
<text>A sophist () was a teacher in ancient Greece in the fifth and fourth centuries BCE. Sophists specialized in one or more subject areas, such as philosophy, rhetoric, music, athletics and mathematics. They taught &quot;arete&quot;, &quot;virtue&quot; or &quot;excellence&quot;, predominantly to young statesmen and nobility.

The arts of the sophists were known as sophistry and gained a negative reputation as tools of arbitrary reasoning. &quot;Sophistry&quot; is today used as a pejorative for a superficially sound but intellectually dishonest argument in support of a foregone conclusion.

==Etymology==
The Greek word is related to the noun . Since the times of Homer, it commonly referred to an expert in his profession or craft. Charioteers, sculptors, or military experts could be referred to as in their occupations. The word has gradually come to connote general wisdom and especially wisdom in human affairs such as politics, ethics, and household management. This was the meaning ascribed to the Greek Seven Sages of 7th and 6th century BCE (such as Solon and Thales), and it was the meaning that appears in the histories of Herodotus.

The word gives rise to the verb , the passive voice of which means &quot;to become or be wise&quot;, or &quot;to be clever or skilled&quot;. From the verb is derived the noun , which originally meant &quot;a master of one&#x27;s craft&quot; and later &quot;a prudent man&quot; or &quot;wise man&quot;. The word for &quot;sophist&quot; in various languages comes from .

The word &quot;sophist&quot; could be combined with other Greek words to form compounds. Examples include &quot;meteorosophist&quot;, which roughly translates to &quot;expert in celestial phenomena&quot;; &quot;gymnosophist&quot; (or &quot;naked sophist&quot;, a word used to refer to Indian philosophers), &quot;deipnosophist&quot; or &quot;dinner sophist&quot; (as in the title of Athenaeus&#x27;s ), and &quot;iatrosophist&quot;, a type of physician in the later Roman period.

==History==
In the second half of the 5th century BCE, particularly in Athens, &quot;sophist&quot; came to denote a class of mostly itinerant intellectuals who taught courses in various subjects, speculated about the nature of language and culture, and employed rhetoric to achieve their purposes, generally to persuade or convince others. Nicholas Denyer observes that the Sophists &quot;did ... have one important thing in common: whatever else they did or did not claim to know, they characteristically had a great understanding of what words would entertain or impress or persuade an audience.&quot; Sophists went to Athens to teach because the city was flourishing at the time. It was good employment for those good at debate, which was a speciality of the first sophists, and they received the fame and fortune they were seeking. Protagoras is generally regarded as the first of these professional sophists. Others include Gorgias, Prodicus, Hippias, Thrasymachus, Lycophron, Callicles, Antiphon, and Cratylus. A few sophists claimed that they could find the answers to all questions. Most of these sophists are known today primarily through the writings of their opponents (particularly Plato and Aristotle), which makes it difficult to assemble an unbiased view of their practices and teachings. In some cases, such as Gorgias, original rhetorical works are extant, allowing the author to be judged on his own terms, but in most cases, knowledge about what individual sophists wrote or said comes from fragmentary quotations that lack context and are usually hostile.

The Greeks were &quot;experimenting with a new form of government, democracy&quot; (W. Keith, 5). Therefore, they were navigating how to make decisions without a higher authority. They needed to create laws based on demand and popular vote of the people. Back in the fifth century they did not have mass media, printing presses, and barely any texts. They mostly relied on speech. This meant that &quot;the Athenians needed a strategy for effectively talking to other people in juries, in forums, and in the senate&quot; (W. Keith, 5). This is when the sophist began to come about. Originally known as Sicilians, they began to teach Athenians how to speak in a persuasive manner in order to work with the courts and senate. It is not really known how these Sicilians, who came to be Sophists, initially grew an interest to teach others how to speak persuasively. However, the interest in receiving training from the Sophists increased. 
(&quot;The Origins of Rhetoric&quot; Keith &amp; Lundberg)

Sophists could be described both as teachers and philosophers, having travelled about in Greece teaching their students various life skills, particularly rhetoric and public speaking. These were useful qualities of the time, during which persuasive ability had a large influence on one&#x27;s political power and economic wealth. Athens became the center of the sophists&#x27; activity, due to the city&#x27;s freedom of speech for non-slave citizens and its wealth of resources. The sophists as a group had no set teachings, and they lectured on subjects that were as diverse as semantics and rhetoric, to ontology, and epistemology. Most sophists claimed to teach &quot;arete&quot; (&quot;excellence&quot; or &quot;virtue&quot;) in the management and administration of not only one&#x27;s affairs, but the city&#x27;s as well. Before the 5th century BCE, it was believed that aristocratic birth qualified a person for arete and politics. However, Protagoras, who is regarded as the first sophist, argued that arete was the result of training rather than birth.

==Major figures==
Most of what is known about sophists comes from commentaries from others. In some cases, such as Gorgias, some of his works survive, allowing the author to be judged on his own terms. In one case, the Dissoi logoi, an important sophist text survived but knowledge of its author has been lost. However, most knowledge of sophist thought comes from fragmentary quotations that lack context. Many of these quotations come from Aristotle, who seems to have held the sophists in slight regard.

===Protagoras===

Protagoras was one of the best known and most successful sophists of his era; however, some later philosophers, such as Sextus Empiricus treat him as a founder of a philosophy rather than as a sophist. Protagoras taught his students the necessary skills and knowledge for a successful life, particularly in politics. He trained his pupils to argue from both points of view because he believed that truth could not be limited to just one side of the argument. Protagoras wrote about a variety of subjects and advanced several philosophical ideas, particularly in epistemology. Some fragments of his works have survived. He is the author of the famous saying, &quot;Man is the measure of all things&quot;, which is the opening sentence of a work called &quot;Truth&quot;.

===Xeniades===

Xeniades was a skeptical philosopher from Corinth, probably a follower of the pre-Socratic Xenophanes. There may have been two such persons, as he is referenced by Democritus c. 400 BCE, though was also supposedly the purchaser of Diogenes the Cynic c. 350 BCE, when he was captured by pirates and sold as a slave. Xeniades was supposed to have been the man who persuaded Monimus to become a follower of Diogenes, and was the source of his skeptical doctrines. The little that is known of him is derived from Sextus Empiricus, who represents him as holding the most ultrasceptical opinions, and maintaining that all notions are false, and that there is absolutely nothing true in the universe. He more than once couples him with Xenophanes.

===Gorgias===

Gorgias was a well-known sophist whose writings showcased his ability to make counter-intuitive and unpopular positions appear stronger. Gorgias authored a lost work known as &quot;On the Non-Existent&quot;, which argues that nothing exists. In it, he attempts to persuade his readers that thought and existence are different. He also wrote &quot;Encomium of Helen&quot; in which he presents all of the possible reasons for which Helen could be blamed for causing the Trojan War and refutes each one of them.

===Lycophron===

Lycophron is mentioned as a sophist by Aristotle, and was probably among the students of Gorgias He rejected the supposed value of an aristocratic birth, claiming that &quot;Now the nobility of good birth is obscure, and its grandeur a matter of words.&quot; meaning that there is no factual difference between those well-born and those low-born; only words and opinion assign value to these different circumstances of birth. This statement may indicate that Lycophron shared the beliefs of Antiphon, that (regardless of their ancestry) both Greeks and barbarians are born with the same capacities: An egalitarian belief that was a minority view in the 5th century BCE. He is also known for his statement (reproduced by Aristotle, in the latter&#x27;s &quot;Politics&quot;, 1280b10), that &quot;law is only a convention, a surety to another of justice&quot;. Also translated as &quot;a guarantor of men&#x27;s rights against one another&quot;. He, thus, believed that law is a matter of agreement, a social convention and not a natural or universal standard (there is no evidence that Lycophron rejected the idea that law is a universal standard – indeed his view appears far more universalist than that of Aristotle, in that Lycophron proposes a single standard, what would now be called the non aggression principle, in relation to all states). In this respect his views on law are similar to those of Protagoras. This means that he treats law as a mere means, in the context of a (perhaps primitive) social contract theory, without considering it as something special, in contradistinction to, e.g., Plato but similar to both Thrasymachus and Callicles, albeit that their theories have – as far as can be ascertained from the information available about them – more specific characteristics.
==Criticism==

Many sophists taught their skills for a price. Due to the importance of such skills in the litigious social life of Athens, practitioners often commanded very high fees. The sophists&#x27; practice of questioning the existence and roles of traditional deities and investigating into the nature of the heavens and the earth prompted a popular reaction against them. As there was a popular view of Socrates as a sophist, he was among the targets (which prompted a vigorous condemnation from his followers, including Plato and Xenophon). For example, in the comic play &quot;The Clouds&quot;, Aristophanes criticizes the sophists as hairsplitting wordsmiths, and makes Socrates their representative. Such criticism, coupled with the wealth garnered by many sophist practitioners, eventually led to popular resentment against sophists and the ideas and writings associated with sophism.

===Aristophanes===
The comic playwright Aristophanes, a contemporary of the sophists, criticized the sophists as hairsplitting wordsmiths. Aristophanes, however, made no distinction between sophists and philosophers, and showed either of them as willing to argue any position for the right fee. In Aristophanes&#x27;s comedic play &quot;The Clouds&quot;, Strepsiades seeks the help of Socrates (a parody of the actual philosopher) in an effort to avoid paying his debts. In the play, Socrates promises to teach Strepsiades&#x27; son to argue his way out of paying his debts.

===Socrates===
An ongoing debate is centered on the difference between the sophists, who charged for their services, and Socrates, who did not. Instead of giving instruction Socrates professed a self-effacing and questioning posture, exemplified by what is known as the Socratic method (although Diogenes Laërtius wrote that Protagoras, a sophist, invented this method). Socrates&#x27; attitude towards the sophists was not entirely oppositional. In one dialogue Socrates even stated that the sophists were better educators than he was, which he validated by sending one of his students to study under a sophist. W. K. C. Guthrie classified Socrates as a sophist in his &quot;History of Greek Philosophy&quot;.

=== Isocrates ===
One of the few speeches that have survived from ancient Greece is Isocrates&#x27; &quot;Against the Sophists.&quot; The speech offers scathing criticisms against sophist teachers and their failures.

While a sophist himself, Isocrates sought to distinguish his school&#x27;s pedagogical focus from other sophistic teachings. In particular, Isocrates wanted to establish an institution that educated Athenian students in a manner that would promote the success of Athenian democracy. By developing a school in Athens around 392 BCE, approximately five years after Plato opened his Platonic Academy, Isocrates gave sophism more credibility in society.

===Plato===
As only small portions of the sophists&#x27; writings have survived they are mainly known through the works of Plato. Plato&#x27;s dialogs present his generally hostile views on the sophists&#x27; thought, due to which he is largely responsible for the modern view of the sophist as an avaricious instructor who teaches deception.

Before Plato, the word &quot;sophist&quot; could be used as either a respectful or contemptuous title. It was in Plato&#x27;s dialogue, &quot;Sophist&quot;, that the first record of an attempt to answer the question &quot;what is a sophist?&quot; is made. Plato described sophists as paid hunters after the young and wealthy, as merchants of knowledge, as athletes in a contest of words, and purgers of souls. From Plato&#x27;s assessment of sophists it could be concluded that sophists do not offer true knowledge, but only an opinion of things. Plato describes them as shadows of the true, saying, &quot;the art of contradiction making, descended from an insincere kind of conceited mimicry, of the semblance-making breed, derived from image making, distinguished as portion, not divine but human, of production, that presents, a shadow play of words—such are the blood and the lineage which can, with perfect truth, be assigned to the authentic sophist&quot;. Plato sought to distinguish sophists from philosophers, arguing that a sophist was a person who made his living through deception, whereas a philosopher was a lover of wisdom who sought the truth. To give the philosophers greater credence, Plato gave the sophists a negative connotation.

Plato depicts Socrates as refuting sophists in several dialogues. These texts often depict the sophists in an unflattering light, and it is unclear how accurate or fair Plato&#x27;s representation of them may be; however, Protagoras and Prodicus are portrayed in a largely positive light in &quot;Protagoras.&quot; Protagoras argued that &quot;man is the measure of all things&quot;, meaning man decides for himself what he is going to believe. The works of Plato and Aristotle have had much influence on the modern view of the &quot;sophist&quot; as a greedy instructor who uses rhetorical sleight-of-hand and ambiguities of language in order to deceive, or to support fallacious reasoning. In this view, the sophist is not concerned with truth and justice, but instead seeks power.

Some scholars, such as Ugo Zilioli argue that the sophists held a relativistic view on cognition and knowledge. However, this may involve the Greek word &quot;doxa&quot;, which means &quot;culturally shared belief&quot; rather than &quot;individual opinion&quot;. The sophists&#x27; philosophy contains criticisms of religion, law, and ethics. Although many sophists were apparently as religious as their contemporaries, some held atheistic or agnostic views (for example, Protagoras and Diagoras of Melos).

==Influence==
Few writings from and about the first sophists survive. The early sophists charged money in exchange for education and providing wisdom, and so were typically employed by wealthy people. This practice resulted in the condemnations made by Plato through Socrates in his dialogues, as well as by Xenophon in his &quot;Memorabilia&quot; and, somewhat controversially, by Aristotle. As a paid tutor to Alexander the Great, Aristotle could be accused of being a sophist. Aristotle did not actually accept payment from Philip, Alexander&#x27;s father, but requested that Philip reconstruct Aristotle&#x27;s home town of Stageira as payment, which Philip had destroyed in a previous campaign, terms which Philip accepted. James A. Herrick wrote: &quot;In &quot;De Oratore&quot;, Cicero blames Plato for separating wisdom and eloquence in the philosopher&#x27;s famous attack on the sophists in &quot;Gorgias&quot;.&quot; Through works such as these, sophists were portrayed as &quot;&quot; or &quot;deceptive&quot;, hence the of the term.

===Democracy===
The sophists&#x27; rhetorical techniques were useful for any young nobleman seeking public office. The societal roles the sophists filled had important ramifications for the Athenian political system. The historical context provides evidence for their considerable influence, as Athens became more and more democratic during the period in which the sophists were most active.

Even though Athens was already a flourishing democracy before their arrival, the cultural and psychological contributions of the sophists played an important role in the growth of Athenian democracy. Sophists contributed to the new democracy in part by espousing expertise in public deliberation, the foundation of decision-making, which allowed—and perhaps required—a tolerance of the beliefs of others. This liberal attitude would naturally have made its way into the Athenian assembly as sophists began acquiring increasingly high-powered clients. Continuous rhetorical training gave the citizens of Athens &quot;the ability to create accounts of communal possibilities through persuasive speech&quot;. This was important for the democracy, as it gave disparate and sometimes superficially unattractive views a chance to be heard in the Athenian assembly.

In addition, sophists had a great impact on the early development of law, as the sophists were the first lawyers in the world. Their status as lawyers was a result of their highly developed skills in argument.

===Education===

====Athens====
The sophists were the first formal teachers of the art of speaking and writing in the Western world. Their influence on education in general, and medical education in particular, has been described by Seamus Mac Suibhne. The sophists &quot;offer quite a different epistemic field from that mapped by Aristotle&quot;, according to scholar Susan Jarratt, writer of &quot;Rereading the Sophists: Classical Rhetoric Refigured.&quot;

For the sophists, the science of eloquence became a method to earn money. In order to teach their students the art of persuasion and demonstrate their thoughts, they focused on two techniques: dialectics and rhetoric. The sophists taught their students two main techniques: the usage of sophisms and contradictions. These means distinguished the speeches of the sophists from the other speakers. Contradictions (antithesis ) were important to the Sophists because they believed that a good rhetorician should be able to defend both his own opinion and the exact opposite one. In this way, was developed the ability to find clear, convincing arguments for any thesis. For the sophists, the primary purpose was to win the dispute in order to prove their excellence in word usage. They were convinced that there was no verity, but there were different opinions, equal in importance, and the &quot;verity&quot; was the only one that would be more convincingly demonstrated by the rhetorician.

Sophists were not limited in their speeches only to topics in which they were aware. For them, there were no topics they could not dispute, because their skill reached such a level that they were able to talk about completely unknown things to them and still impress upon listeners and the opponent. The main purpose was to pick an approach to the audience, to please it and to adapt the speech to it. Unlike Plato&#x27;s approach, the Sophist rhetoricians did not focus on identifying the truth, but the most important thing for them was to prove their case.

The first sophist whose speeches are a perfect example of a sophisticated approach is Gorgias. One of his most famous speeches is the &quot;Praise of Helen&quot;, which has made a significant contribution to rhetorical art. In this speech, Gorgias aims to make something almost impossible – to justify Helen, about whom the people have already had a negative opinion. By methods of double oppositions, stringing of repetitive positive qualities and insightful consistent arguments, Gorgias gradually purifies the poor reputation of a woman. Later, Aristotle described the means used in Gorgias&#x27; speech as &quot;Gorgias figures&quot;. All of these figures create the most accessible path for the audience to the argument offered, varying depending on the type of speech and audience.

====Rome====
The classical tradition of rhetoric and composition refers more to philosophers such as Aristotle, Cicero, and Quintilian than to the sophists. Owing largely to the influence of Plato and Aristotle, philosophy came to be regarded as distinct from sophistry, the latter being regarded as specious and rhetorical, a practical discipline. Thus, by the time of the Roman Empire, a sophist was simply a teacher of rhetoric and a popular public speaker. For instance, Libanius, Himerius, Aelius Aristides, and Fronto were sophists in this sense. However, despite the opposition from philosophers Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, it is clear that sophists had a vast influence on a number of spheres, including the growth of knowledge and on ethical-political theory. Their teachings had a huge influence on thought in the 5th century BCE. The sophists focused on the rational examination of human affairs and the betterment and success of human life. They argued that gods could not be the explanation of human action.

Many rhetoricians during this period were instructed under specialists in Greek rhetorical studies as part of their standard education. Cicero, a prominent rhetorician during this period in Roman history, is one such example of the influence of the Second Sophistic on Roman education. His early life coincided with the suppression of Latin rhetoric in Roman education under the edicts of Crassus and Domitius. Cicero was instructed in Greek rhetoric throughout his youth, as well as in other subjects of the Roman rubric under Archias. Cicero benefited in his early education from favorable ties to Crassus.

In his writings, Cicero is said to have shown a &quot;synthesis that he achieved between Greek and Roman culture&quot; summed up in his work &quot;De Oratore. &quot;Despite his oratorical skill, Cicero pressed for a more liberal education in Roman instruction which focused more in the broad sciences including Roman history. He entitled this set of sciences as &quot;politior humanitas&quot; (2.72). Regardless of his efforts toward this end, Greek history was still preferred by the majority of aristocratic Romans during this time.

From the late 1st century CE the Second Sophistic, a philosophical and rhetorical movement, was the chief expression of intellectual life. The term &quot;Second Sophistic&quot; comes from Philostratus, who, rejecting the term &quot;New Sophistic&quot;, traced the beginnings of the movement to the orator Aeschines in the 4th century BCE. But its earliest representative was really Nicetes of Smyrna, in the late 1st century CE. Unlike the original Sophistic movement of the 5th century BCE, the Second Sophistic was little concerned with politics. But it was, to a large degree, to meet the everyday needs and respond to the practical problems of Greco-Roman society. It came to dominate higher education and left its mark on many forms of literature. Lucian, himself a writer of the Second Sophistic, even calls Jesus &quot;that crucified sophist&quot;. 

During the Second Sophistic, the Greek discipline of rhetoric heavily influenced Roman education. During this time Latin rhetorical studies were banned for the precedent of Greek rhetorical studies. In addition, Greek history was preferred for educating the Roman elites above that of their native Roman history.

==Modern usage==
In modern usage, &quot;sophism&quot;, &quot;sophist&quot;, and &quot;sophistry&quot; are used disparagingly. A sophism, or sophistry, is a fallacious argument, especially one used deliberately to deceive. A sophist is a person who reasons with clever but fallacious and deceptive arguments.

<text>Daniel Edward Aykroyd ( ; born July 1, 1952) is a Canadian actor, comedian, screenwriter, and producer.

Aykroyd was a writer and an original member of the &quot;Not Ready for Prime Time Players&quot; cast on the NBC sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from its inception in 1975 until his departure in 1979. During his tenure on &quot;SNL&quot;, he appeared in a recurring series of sketches, particularly featuring the Coneheads and the Blues Brothers. For his work on the show, he received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations, winning for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series in 1977. After his departure, he has since returned to guest roles.

Aykroyd&#x27;s most famous roles are as Elwood J. Blues in &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980) and &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot; (1998) and Dr. Raymond &quot;Ray&quot; Stantz in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984), and &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; (1989) (he has reprised his role in various projects within the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; franchise). He also is known for his comedic roles in &quot;1941&quot; (1979), &quot;Trading Places&quot; (1983), &quot;Spies Like Us&quot; (1985), &quot;Dragnet&quot; (1987), &quot;The Great Outdoors&quot; (1988), &quot;Nothing but Trouble&quot; (1991) and &quot;Coneheads&quot; (1993).

In 1990, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Boolie Werthan in &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; (1989). Other dramatic roles include &quot;Chaplin&quot; (1992), &quot;North&quot; (1994) and &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (2001). Aykroyd has done supporting roles in comedy films such as &quot;Tommy Boy&quot; (1995), &quot;Grosse Pointe Blank&quot; (1997), &quot;Loser&quot; (2000), &quot;Evolution&quot; (2001), &quot;50 First Dates&quot; (2004), &quot;I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry&quot; (2007), and &quot;Tammy&quot; (2014).

He starred as Reverend Mike Weber, in the sitcom &quot;Soul Man&quot; (1997–1998). He has made guest appearances on various television shows including &quot;The Nanny&quot; (1994), &quot;According to Jim&quot; (2002–2009), &quot;Living with Fran&quot; (2006), &quot;The Defenders&quot; (2011) and &quot;Workin&#x27; Moms&quot; (2017–2023). Aykroyd is also a businessman, having co-founded the House of Blues chain of music venues and the Crystal Head Vodka brand.

==Early life==
Aykroyd was born on July 1, 1952, at Ottawa General Hospital in Ottawa, Ontario. His father, Samuel Cuthbert Peter Hugh Aykroyd (1922–2020), a civil engineer, worked as a policy adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and his mother, Lorraine Hélène Marie (née Gougeon; 1918–2018), was a secretary. His mother was of French Canadian descent and his father was of English, Scottish, Irish, French, and Dutch ancestry. His paternal ancestor was Englishman Samuel Aykroyd from Halifax, Yorkshire, who emigrated to the United States, eventually settling in Upper Canada near Kingston, Ontario in 1810. His brother, Peter (1955–2021), was also an actor.

He attended St. Pius X and St. Patrick&#x27;s High Schools, and studied criminology and sociology at Carleton University, but dropped out before completing his degree. He worked as a comedian in various Canadian nightclubs and ran an after-hours speakeasy, Club 505, in Toronto for several years.

Aykroyd developed his musical career in Ottawa, particularly through his regular attendance at Le Hibou, a club that featured many blues artists. He describes these influences:

Aykroyd&#x27;s first professional experience, which he gained at the age of 17, was as a member of the cast of the short-lived Canadian sketch comedy series &quot;The Hart and Lorne Terrific Hour&quot; with Lorne Michaels, among others. He was a member of the Second City comedy troupe in 1973 in both Toronto and Chicago.

==Career==
===&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;===
Aykroyd gained fame on the American late-night comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;). He was originally hired, and paid $278 a week (equivalent to $1,603 in 2024), as a writer for the show, but became a part of the cast before the series premiered. The original cast was referred to on the show as &quot;The Not Ready For Prime Time Players&quot;. Aykroyd was the youngest member of the cast, and appeared on the show for its first four seasons, from 1975 to 1979. He brought a sensibility to the show which combined youth, unusual interests, talent as an impersonator, and a manic intensity. Guest host Eric Idle of Monty Python said that Aykroyd&#x27;s ability to write and act out characters made him the only member of the &quot;SNL&quot; cast capable of being a Python.

He was known for his impersonations of celebrities such as Jimmy Carter, Vincent Price, Richard Nixon, Rod Serling, Tom Snyder, and Julia Child. He was also known for his recurring roles, such as Beldar, father of the Coneheads family; with Steve Martin, Yortuk Festrunk, one of the &quot;Two Wild and Crazy Guys&quot; brothers from Bratislava, Slovakia; sleazy late-night cable TV host E. Buzz Miller and his cousin, corrupt maker of children&#x27;s toys and costumes Irwin Mainway (who extolled the virtues and defended the safety of the &quot;Bag-o-Glass&quot; toy); Fred Garvin, a male prostitute; and high-bred but low-brow critic Leonard Pinth-Garnell. Aykroyd and Jane Curtin parodied the Point/Counterpoint segment on the CBS news show &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, which featured the liberal Shana Alexander and the conservative segregationist James Kilpatrick, by portraying the two as hating each another; Aykroyd&#x27;s first words in response to Curtin&#x27;s point were, &quot;Jane, you ignorant slut!&quot;.

Aykroyd&#x27;s eccentric talent was recognized by others in the highly competitive &quot;SNL&quot; environment; when he first presented his &quot;Super Bass-O-Matic &#x27;76&quot; sketch, a fake TV commercial in which a garish, hyper-pitchman (based on Ron Popeil) touts a food blender that turns an entire bass into liquid pulp, the other writers and cast members considered the sketch &quot;so exhilaratingly strange that many remember sitting and listening, open-mouthed... Nobody felt jealous of it because they couldn&#x27;t imagine writing anything remotely like it.&quot; Aykroyd later said that the inspiration for the sketch was seeing his aunt Helene Gougeon (a culinary writer and food columnist in Montreal) put a bass into a blender in order to make a bouillabaisse when he was 12 years old.

While Aykroyd was a close friend and partner with fellow cast member John Belushi and shared some of the same sensibilities, Aykroyd was more reserved and less self-destructive. Aykroyd later recalled that, unlike Belushi and others of his peers, he was uninterested in recreational drug use.

In 1977, he received an Emmy Award for writing on &quot;SNL&quot;; he later received two more nominations for writing and one for acting. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 &quot;SNL&quot; cast members to date, Aykroyd was ranked fifth (behind Belushi, Eddie Murphy, Tina Fey, and Mike Myers). &quot;Of all the original [&quot;SNL&quot;] greats, Aykroyd is the least imitated&quot;, they wrote, &quot;because nobody else can do what he did.&quot;

In later decades, Aykroyd made occasional guest appearances and unannounced cameos on &quot;SNL&quot;, often impersonating the American politician Bob Dole. He also brought back past characters including Irwin Mainway and Leonard Pinth-Garnell. In 1995, he appeared on the show to introduce a performance by Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip. Aykroyd, who is a fan of the band, had personally lobbied Lorne Michaels to book them as musical guests.

During some guest appearances, he resurrected the Blues Brothers musical act with frequent host John Goodman in place of Belushi, who was by then deceased. He became the second member of the original cast to host &quot;SNL&quot; in May 2003, when he appeared in the season finale. During his monologue, he performed a musical number with James Belushi similar to the Blues Brothers, but neither Aykroyd nor Belushi donned the black suit and sunglasses. On March 24, 2007, Aykroyd appeared as a crying fan of &quot;American Idol&quot; finalist Sanjaya Malakar (played by Andy Samberg) during &quot;Weekend Update&quot;. On February 14, 2009, he appeared as U.S. House Minority leader John Boehner. Aykroyd also made a surprise guest appearance, along with many other &quot;SNL&quot; alumni, on the show of March 9, 2013.

===&quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;===
Aykroyd was a close friend of John Belushi. According to Aykroyd, their first meeting helped spark the Blues Brothers act. When they met in a club that Aykroyd frequented, he played a blues record in the background, and it stimulated a fascination with blues in Belushi, who was primarily a fan of heavy rock bands at the time. Aykroyd educated Belushi on the finer points of blues music, and with a little encouragement from then-&quot;SNL&quot; music director Paul Shaffer, it led to the creation of their Blues Brothers characters.

Backed by such experienced professional R&amp;B sidemen as lead guitarist Steve Cropper, sax man Lou Marini, trumpeter Alan Rubin, and bass guitarist Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn, the Blues Brothers proved more than an &quot;SNL&quot; novelty. Taking off with the public as a legitimate musical act, they performed live gigs and in 1978 released the hit album &quot;Briefcase Full of Blues&quot; (drawn from the fact that Aykroyd, as &quot;Elwood Blues&quot;, carried his blues harmonicas in a briefcase that he kept handcuffed to his wrist, in the manner of a CIA courier; Belushi originally carried the key to those handcuffs). &quot;Briefcase Full of Blues&quot; eventually sold 3.5 million copies, and is one of the highest-selling blues albums of all time. The band was much further popularized in the 1980 film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, which Aykroyd co-wrote. A sequel, titled &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot;, was released in 1998 and featured John Goodman as Belushi&#x27;s replacement.

Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles was a regular haunt for the original Blues Brothers in the early days of the band. Belushi and Aykroyd became fixtures at the recording studio, while Blues Brothers band member Steve Cropper called Cherokee his producing home. Whenever they needed a bass player, they were joined by another band member, Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn. During this time, Cropper, along with producing partner and Cherokee owner Bruce Robb, worked on a number of music projects with the two comedians/musicians, including Belushi&#x27;s favourite band, Fear, and later Aykroyd&#x27;s movie &quot;Dragnet&quot;.

The Blues Brothers Band continues to tour, both with and without Aykroyd. The band features original members Cropper and Marini, along with vocalist Eddie Floyd. Aykroyd sometimes performs as Elwood, along with Belushi&#x27;s younger brother Jim Belushi, who plays &quot;Brother Zee&quot; on stage. They are most frequently backed by the Sacred Hearts Band.

===Other film and television work===
Concurrent with his work in &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Aykroyd played the role of Purvis Bickle, lift operator at the fictitious office block 99 Sumach Street in the CBC Television series &quot;Coming Up Rosie&quot;.

After leaving &quot;SNL&quot;, Aykroyd starred in a number of films, mostly comedies, with uneven results both commercially and artistically. His first three American feature films all co-starred Belushi. The first, &quot;1941&quot; (1979), directed by Steven Spielberg, was a box-office disappointment. The second, &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980), which he co-wrote with director John Landis, was a massive hit. The third, &quot;Neighbors&quot; (1981) had mixed critical reaction, but was another box-office hit. One of his best-received performances was as a blueblood-turned-wretch in the 1983 comedy &quot;Trading Places&quot;, in which he co-starred with fellow &quot;SNL&quot; alumnus Eddie Murphy and Jamie Lee Curtis. He also appeared in &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; in the prologue and at the end of Segment Four as the passenger and the ambulance driver.

In the early 1980s, Aykroyd began work on a script for the film that eventually became &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, inspired by his fascination with parapsychology and his belief in ghosts. The script initially included a much greater fantasy element, including time travel, but this was toned down substantially through work on the script with Harold Ramis (who became a co-writer) and director Ivan Reitman. Aykroyd originally wrote the role of Dr. Peter Venkman with Belushi in mind, but rewrote it for Bill Murray after Belushi&#x27;s death. Aykroyd joked that the green ghost, later known as &quot;Slimer&quot;, was &quot;the ghost of John Belushi&quot; and was based on Belushi&#x27;s party-animal personality. &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was released in 1984 and became a huge success for Aykroyd, who also appeared as one of the lead actors; the film earned nearly on a budget. Aykroyd also briefly appeared in the hit 1984 action-adventure film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; as an escort with a British accent. 

Aykroyd&#x27;s next major film role was in the 1985 spy comedy film &quot;Spies Like Us&quot;, which like &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; was co-conceived and co-written by Aykroyd, and directed by Landis. Aykroyd had again intended for Belushi to be the other lead in the film; the part was instead given to &quot;SNL&quot; alumnus Chevy Chase. The film was intended as an homage to the Bob Hope/Bing Crosby &quot;Road to ...&quot; movies of the 1940s to 1960s. Bob Hope made a cameo appearance in the film.

&quot;Dragnet&quot;, in which Aykroyd co-starred (with Tom Hanks) and co-wrote, was released in 1987. The film was both an homage and a satire of the previous &quot;Dragnet&quot; series, with Aykroyd playing Sgt. Joe Friday as a police officer whose law-and-order attitude is at odds with modern sensibilities.

In 1988, Aykroyd co-starred (with John Candy) in the comedy film &quot;The Great Outdoors&quot;. Aykroyd appeared in four other films released in 1988 (&quot;The Couch Trip&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s Having a Baby&quot;, &quot;Caddyshack II&quot;, and &quot;My Stepmother Is an Alien&quot;), all of them critical and commercial failures.

A sequel to &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;, was released in 1989; Aykroyd and the other co-creators were reluctant to make another &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; film, but succumbed to pressure from the film&#x27;s studio, Columbia Pictures. The film, while considered inferior to the original, was another big hit, earning . Aykroyd was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for 1989&#x27;s &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot;. He was the fourth &quot;SNL&quot; cast member to be nominated for an Oscar, following Joan Cusack.

Aykroyd&#x27;s directorial debut was 1991&#x27;s &quot;Nothing but Trouble&quot; starring Demi Moore, Chevy Chase, John Candy, and Aykroyd, sporting a bulbous prosthetic nose. The film was a critical and box-office flop. Most of Aykroyd&#x27;s other films in the 1990s were similarly poorly received, including &quot;Chaplin&quot; (1992), &quot;Coneheads&quot; (1993, also based on a &quot;SNL&quot; skit), &quot;North&quot; (1994), &quot;Exit to Eden&quot; (1994), &quot;Canadian Bacon&quot; (1995), &quot;Getting Away with Murder&quot; (1996), and &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot; (1998). Four exceptions were &quot;My Girl&quot; (1991), which starred Jamie Lee Curtis, and Macaulay Culkin, &quot;Sneakers&quot; (1992), which starred Robert Redford, &quot;Tommy Boy&quot; (1995), which starred &quot;SNL&quot; alumni David Spade and Chris Farley, in which Aykroyd played the role of Ray Zalinsky, and &quot;Grosse Pointe Blank&quot; (1997), in which Aykroyd had a well-received role as a rival hit man.

In 1994, Aykroyd made a guest appearance in an episode of the sitcom &quot;The Nanny&quot; as a refrigerator repairman. In 1997, he starred as an Episcopal priest in the ABC sitcom &quot;Soul Man&quot;, which lasted two seasons. In 1998, he voiced the role of Chip, a wasp, in DreamWorks Animation film &quot;Antz&quot;.

In 2001, Aykroyd starred in the Woody Allen film &quot;The Curse of the Jade Scorpion&quot;. Most of his subsequent film roles have tended to be small character parts in big-budget productions, such as a father in &quot;Loser&quot; (2000), a signals analyst in &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (2001), a neurologist in &quot;50 First Dates&quot; (2004), an annoying neighbor in &quot;Christmas with the Kranks&quot; (2004), and a fire captain in &quot;I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry&quot; (2007). 

In 2009, Aykroyd and Ramis wrote and appeared in &quot;&quot;, which also featured Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, William Atherton, and Brian Doyle-Murray. In 2010, he played the voice of the title character, Yogi Bear, in the live-action/CGI-animated-film &quot;Yogi Bear&quot;. That same year, Aykroyd and Chevy Chase guest-starred in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Spies Reminiscent of Us&quot;, an homage to &quot;Spies Like Us&quot;.

Other television series that Aykroyd appeared in included &quot;According to Jim&quot; (2002–2009, which starred Jim Belushi), &quot;Living with Fran&quot; (2006), and &quot;Workin&#x27; Moms&quot; (2017–2023). Aykroyd appeared in two February 2011 episodes of CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Defenders&quot; as Judge Max Hunter, which also starred Jim Belushi. He also appeared on &quot;Top Chef Canada&quot; as a guest judge. He had supporting roles in the 2012 political comedy film &quot;The Campaign&quot;, which starred &quot;SNL&quot; alum Will Ferrell, and in the 2013 HBO film &quot;Behind the Candelabra&quot;.

In 2014, Aykroyd voiced the role of Scarecrow in &quot;Legends of Oz: Dorothy&#x27;s Return&quot;, and had a supporting role in the comedy film &quot;Tammy&quot;. In 2015, he appeared in a State Farm insurance commercial along with Jane Curtin and Laraine Newman, as the Coneheads, talking to &quot;Jake&quot;, a State Farm agent, and played the emcee of the video game championship in the science fiction comedy film &quot;Pixels&quot;.

Aykroyd was one of the executive producers of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (2016), a long-discussed reboot of the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; franchise, which was released in 2016. Aykroyd had a cameo appearance in the film, along with many of the rest of the surviving original &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; cast.

In early 2021, Aykroyd provided the voice of the Postage Stamp Fellow in the episode &quot;The Dad-Feelings Limited&quot; in the TV series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He also reprised his role of Dr. Ray Stantz in the movie &quot;&quot; (2021). Aykroyd expressed interest in having the surviving three actors of the original Ghostbusters team continuing to reprise their roles for as many sequels as possible while they were alive. Aykroyd again reprises his role in &quot;&quot; (2024).

===Other musical endeavours===
Aykroyd participated in the recording of &quot;We Are the World&quot; in 1985, as a member of the chorus. He wrote the liner notes for fellow Ottawa-born blues musician JW-Jones&#x27;s album &quot;Bluelisted&quot; in 2008. Until its ending in 2018, he hosted the internationally syndicated radio show &quot;Elwood&#x27;s BluesMobile&quot;, formerly known as the &quot;House of Blues Radio Hour&quot;, under his Blues Brothers moniker Elwood Blues.

==Business ventures==

In 1992, Aykroyd and Hard Rock Cafe co-founder Isaac Tigrett founded the House of Blues, a chain of music venues, with the mission to promote African-American cultural contributions to blues music and folk art. 

Many other music and Hollywood personalities helped to finance this chain at its start. It began as a single location in Cambridge, Massachusetts, although other locations quickly followed, starting with a venue in New Orleans in 1994. On New Year&#x27;s Eve that year, Aykroyd opened the &quot;Aykroyd&#x27;s Ghetto House Cafe&quot; on Princess Street in Kingston, Ontario.

In 2004, &quot;House of Blues&quot; became the second-largest live music promoter in the world, with seven venues and 22 amphitheatres in the United States and Canada. It was bought by Live Nation in 2006. In 2007, Aykroyd and artist John Alexander founded Crystal Head Vodka, a brand of high-end vodka known for its distinctive skull-shaped bottle and for being filtered through Herkimer diamond crystals.

In 2016, Aykroyd partnered with TV producers Eric Bischoff and Jason Hervey and game developer Ike McFadden to release an online-casino game that features the Blues Brothers. Aykroyd provided the in-game voice of his Elwood Blues character via voiceover. Aykroyd is also owner in part of several wineries in Canada&#x27;s Niagara Peninsula, and the company that distributes Patrón tequila in Canada.

==Charitable works==
In 2009, Aykroyd contributed a series of reminiscences on his upbringing in Canada for a charity album titled &quot;Dan Aykroyd&#x27;s Canada&quot;. He helped start the Blue Line Foundation, which is redeveloping flood-damaged lots in New Orleans and helping first responders buy them at reduced prices. Coastal Blue Line LLC, hopes to eventually rebuild 400 properties in New Orleans.

Aykroyd is a member of Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.

==Personal life==
Aykroyd was briefly engaged to actress Carrie Fisher, proposing to her on the set of &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;. In the film, she appeared as a jilted girlfriend of John Belushi&#x27;s character Jake Blues. Their engagement ended when she reconciled with her former boyfriend, musician Paul Simon. On April 29, 1983, Aykroyd married actress Donna Dixon on a friend&#x27;s rooftop in Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. The couple met on the set of &quot;Doctor Detroit&quot; released the same year and appeared together in four additional films: &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; (1983), &quot;Spies Like Us&quot; (1985), &quot;The Couch Trip&quot; (1988), and &quot;Exit to Eden&quot; (1994). Together, they have three daughters, including Danielle (known by her stage name, Vera Sola). The couple announced in April 2022 that they were separating after 39 years of marriage, but would remain legally married.

Aykroyd maintains his Canadian roots as a longtime resident of Sydenham, Ontario, with his estate on Loughborough Lake.

In a 2004 NPR interview with host Terry Gross, Aykroyd said that he had been diagnosed in childhood with Tourette syndrome (TS). He stated that his TS was successfully treated with therapy. In 2015, he stated during a &quot;HuffPost Show&quot; interview with hosts Roy Sekoff and Marc Lamont Hill that he has Asperger syndrome which was &quot;never diagnosed&quot;, but was &quot;sort of a self-diagnosis&quot; based on several of his own characteristics, contradicting his earlier claim in the &quot;[Daily Mail]&quot; that he had been officially diagnosed in the early 1980s after his then wife Donna persuaded him to see a doctor.

Aykroyd is a former reserve commander for the police department in Harahan, Louisiana, working for Chief of Police Peter Dale. While on the force, Aykroyd carried his badge with him at all times. He currently serves as a reserve deputy of the Hinds County Sheriff&#x27;s Department in Hinds County, Mississippi. He supports the reserves with a fundraiser concert along with other blues and gospel singers in Mississippi.

Aykroyd&#x27;s passions for the outdoors, geology and paleontology, which he attributes to watching his father work on constructing the Gatineau Parkway which included blasting through granite rock formations to run the highway, have led him to join Canadian paleontologist Philip J. Currie on a number of digs, including fundraising digs and galas as fundraisers for the construction of the Philip J. Currie Dinosaur Museum in Wembley, Alberta, which recognized Aykroyd&#x27;s contributions by naming its theatre the &quot;Aykroyd Family Theatre&quot;.

Aykroyd has obtained American citizenship.

===Friendship with John Belushi===
In an appearance on the &quot;Today&quot; show, Aykroyd referred to John Belushi and himself as &quot;kindred spirits&quot;. In the biography &quot;Belushi&quot;, Aykroyd claims that Belushi was the only man with whom he could ever dance. The pair were scheduled to present the Academy Award for Visual Effects in 1982, but Belushi died just a few weeks prior to the ceremony. Though devastated by his friend&#x27;s death, Aykroyd presented the award alone, remarking from the stage, &quot;My partner would have loved to have been here to present this, given that he was something of a visual effect himself.&quot;

Aykroyd was an outspoken critic of the 1989 film &quot;Wired&quot;, a biopic of Belushi which was based on the 1984 book of the same name by journalist Bob Woodward, and starred Michael Chiklis in his film debut as Belushi, and featured him as a character played by actor Gary Groomes. Along with Belushi&#x27;s widow Judith and brother Jim, and many other friends, associates and relatives of Belushi, he boycotted the film and the associated book for misrepresenting Belushi&#x27;s life, and during an interview for MTV&#x27;s &quot;The Big Picture&quot; in June 1988, he expressed his desire that the film would underperform at the box office, which ultimately happened; he said, &quot;I have witches working now to jinx the thing... I hope it never gets seen and I am going to hurl all the negative energy I can and muster all my hell energies [against them]. My thunderbolts are out on this one, quite truthfully.&quot; He had actor J. T. Walsh removed from the film &quot;Loose Cannons&quot; after Walsh had already done two days of filming in the role of Grimmer, after finding out that Walsh had been in the cast of &quot;Wired&quot;. Walsh, who had played Bob Woodward in &quot;Wired&quot;, was replaced as Grimmer by fellow Canadian actor Paul Koslo, causing the film a $125,000 production delay.

===Beliefs===
Aykroyd considers himself a Spiritualist, stating:
:I am a Spiritualist, a proud wearer of the Spiritualist badge. Mediums and psychic research have gone on for many, many years ... Loads of people have seen spirits, heard a voice, or felt the cold temperature. I believe that they are between here and there, that they exist between the fourth and fifth dimensions, and that they visit us frequently.

Aykroyd&#x27;s great-grandfather, a dentist, was a mystic who corresponded with author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle on the subject of Spiritualism, and was a member of the Lily Dale Society. Other than Spiritualism, Aykroyd is also interested in various other aspects of the paranormal, particularly UFOlogy. He is a lifetime member of and official Hollywood consultant for the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON). Along these lines, he served, from 1996 to 2000, as host of &quot;Psi Factor: Chronicles of the Paranormal&quot;, which claimed to describe cases drawn from the archives of &quot;The Office of Scientific Investigation and Research&quot;. In 2005, Aykroyd produced the DVD &quot;Dan Aykroyd: Unplugged on UFOs&quot;.

Aykroyd was interviewed for 80 minutes by UFOlogist David Sereda, discussing in depth many aspects of the UFO phenomenon.

On September 29, 2009, Peter Aykroyd Sr., Dan&#x27;s father, published a book entitled &quot;A History of Ghosts&quot;. This book chronicled the family&#x27;s historical involvement in the Spiritualist movement, to which Aykroyd readily refers. Aykroyd wrote the introduction and accompanied his father on a series of promotional activities, including launches in New York and Toronto, appearances on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; and &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;, and various other public-relations initiatives. Aykroyd also read the introduction for the audio version of the book. In 1997, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry awarded Aykroyd &quot;in absentia&quot; the Snuffed Candle Award for hosting &quot;Psi Factor&quot; and being a &quot;long-time promoter ... of paranormal claims&quot;. Following the awards, Joe Nickell wrote to Aykroyd asking for the research behind the &quot;cases&quot; presented on &quot;Psi Factor&quot;, particularly a claim that NASA scientists were &quot;killed while investigating a meteor crash and giant eggs were found and incubated, yielding a flea the size of a hog&quot;.

<text>The Treaty of Portsmouth is a treaty that formally ended the 1904–1905 Russo-Japanese War. It was signed on September 5, 1905, after negotiations from August 6 to 30, at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, United States. U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt was instrumental in the negotiations and won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts, the first ever American recipient. The treaty recognized Japan&#x27;s hegemony in Korea (which soon after became a protectorate of the Empire of Japan), awarded it Russia&#x27;s lease on the Liaodong Peninsula (which became the Kwantung Leased Territory), control of the Russian-built South Manchuria Railway, and the southern half of the island of Sakhalin (Karafuto).

==Background==
The war of 1904–1905 was fought between the Russian Empire, an international power with one of the largest armies in the world, and the Japanese Empire, a nation that had only recently industrialized after two-and-a-half centuries of isolation. A series of battles in the Liaodong Peninsula had resulted in Russian armies being driven from southern Manchuria, and the Battle of Tsushima had resulted in a cataclysm for the Imperial Russian Navy. The war was unpopular in Russia, whose government was under increasing threat of revolution at home. On the other hand, the Japanese economy was severely strained by the war, with rapidly mounting foreign debts, and Japanese forces in Manchuria faced the problem of ever-extending supply lines. No Russian territory had been seized, and the Russians continued to build up reinforcements via the Trans-Siberian Railway. Recognizing that a long war was not to Japan&#x27;s advantage, the Japanese government as early as July 1904 had begun seeking out intermediaries to assist in bringing the war to a negotiated conclusion.

The intermediary approached by the Japanese was U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, who had publicly expressed a pro-Japanese stance at the beginning of the war. However, as the war progressed, Roosevelt had begun to show concerns on the strengthening military power of Japan and its long-term impact on U.S. interests in Asia. In February 1905, Roosevelt sent messages to the Russian government via the U.S. ambassador in Saint Petersburg. Initially, the Russians were unresponsive, with Tsar Nicholas II still adamant that Russia would eventually prove victorious. The Japanese government was also lukewarm to a peace treaty, as Japanese armies were enjoying an unbroken string of victories. However, after the Battle of Mukden, which was extremely costly to both sides in terms of manpower and resources, Japanese Foreign Minister Komura Jutarō judged that it was now critical for Japan to push for a settlement.

On March 8, 1905, Japanese Army Minister Terauchi Masatake met with the American Minister to Japan, Lloyd Griscom, to tell Roosevelt that Japan was ready to negotiate. However, a positive response did not come from Russia until after the loss of the Russian fleet at the Battle of Tsushima. Two days later, Nicholas met with his grand dukes and military leadership and agreed to discuss peace. On June 7, 1905, Roosevelt met with Kaneko Kentarō, a Japanese diplomat, and on June 8, he received a positive reply from Russia. Roosevelt chose Portsmouth, New Hampshire, as the site for the negotiations, primarily because the talks were to begin in August, and the cooler climate in Portsmouth would avoid subjecting the parties to the sweltering Washington summer.

==Portsmouth Peace Conference==

The Japanese delegation to the Portsmouth Peace Conference was led by Foreign Minister Komura Jutarō and assisted by Ambassador Takahira Kogorō. The Russian delegation was led by former Finance Minister Sergei Witte, who was assisted by the former Ambassador to Japan Roman Rosen and the international law and arbitration specialist Friedrich Martens. The delegations arrived in Portsmouth on August 8 and stayed in New Castle, New Hampshire, at the Hotel Wentworth, where the armistice was signed. They were ferried across the Piscataqua River every day to the naval base in Kittery, Maine, where the negotiations were held.

The negotiations took place at the General Stores Building (now Building 86). Mahogany furniture patterned after the Cabinet Room of the White House was ordered from Washington.

Before the negotiations began, Tsar Nicholas had adopted a hard line and forbidden his delegates to agree to any territorial concessions, reparations, or limitations on the deployment of Russian forces in the Far East. The Japanese initially demanded recognition of their interests in Korea, the removal of all Russian forces from Manchuria, and substantial reparations. They also wanted confirmation of their control of the island of Sakhalin, which Japanese forces had seized in July 1905, partly to use as a in the negotiations.

A total of twelve sessions were held between August 9 and August 30. During the first eight sessions, the delegates were able to reach an agreement on eight points. These included an immediate ceasefire, recognition of Japan&#x27;s claims to Korea, and the evacuation of Russian forces from Manchuria. Russia also ceded its leases in southern Manchuria (containing Port Arthur and Talien) to Japan and turned over the South Manchuria Railway and its mining concessions to Japan. Russia was allowed to retain the Chinese Eastern Railway in northern Manchuria. 
The remaining four sessions addressed the most difficult issues: reparations and territorial concessions. On August 18, Roosevelt proposed that Rosen offer to divide Sakhalin to address the territory issue. On August 23, however, Witte proposed that the Japanese keep Sakhalin and drop their claims for reparations. When Komura rejected the proposal, Witte warned that he was instructed to cease negotiations and that the war would resume. The ultimatum came as four new Russian divisions arrived in Manchuria, and the Russian delegation made an ostentatious show of packing their bags and preparing to depart. Witte was convinced that the Japanese could not afford to restart the war and so applied pressure via the American media and his American hosts to convince the Japanese that monetary compensation was not open for compromise by Russia. Outmaneuvered by Witte, Komura yielded, and in exchange for the southern half of Sakhalin, the Japanese dropped their claims for reparations.

The Treaty of Portsmouth was signed on September 5. The treaty was ratified by the Privy Council of Japan on October 10, and in Russia on October 14, 1905.

==Aftermath==
The signing of the treaty created three decades of peace between the two nations and confirmed Japan&#x27;s emergence as the pre-eminent power in East Asia. Born from the Taft–Katsura agreement, Article 2 of the treaty acknowledged that Japan possessed in Korea paramount political, military and economical interests, and later resulted in the annexation of Korea to Japan in 1910.

The treaty also forced Russian Empire to abandon its expansionist policies in East Asia, but it was not well received by the Japanese people. The Japanese public were aware of their country&#x27;s unbroken string of military victories over the Russians but were less aware of the precarious overextension of military and economic power that the victories had required. News of the terms of the treaty appeared to show Japanese weakness in front of the European powers, and this frustration caused the Hibiya riots and the collapse of the First Katsura Cabinet (first premiership of Katsura Tarō) on January 7, 1906.

Because of the role played by Theodore Roosevelt, the United States became a significant force in world diplomacy. President Roosevelt was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1906 for his backchannel efforts before and during the peace negotiations even though he never actually went to Portsmouth.

==Criticism==
Korean historians (such as Ki-baik Lee, author of &quot;A New History of Korea&quot;, Harvard University Press, 1984) believe that the Treaty of Portsmouth violated the Korean–American Treaty of Amity and Commerce signed at Incheon on May 22, 1882, because the Joseon government considered that treaty constituted a &quot;de facto&quot; mutual defense treaty, unlike the Americans. The problem was Article 1: &quot;There shall be perpetual peace and friendship between the President of the United States and the King of Chosen and the citizens and subjects of their respective Governments. If other powers deal unjustly or oppressively with either Government, the other will exert their good offices on being informed of the case to bring about an amicable arrangement, thus showing their friendly feelings.&quot;

The treaty has been cited in contemporary South Korea by some as an example that the United States cannot be relied upon with regards to issues of South Korean security and sovereignty.

==Commemoration==
In 1994, the Portsmouth Peace Treaty Forum was created by the Japan-America Society of New Hampshire to commemorate the Portsmouth Peace Treaty with the first formal meeting between Japanese and Russian scholars and diplomats in Portsmouth since 1905. As the Treaty of Portsmouth was one of the most powerful symbols of peace in the Northern Pacific region and the most significant shared peace history of Japan, Russia, and the United States, the forum was designed to explore from the Japanese, Russian, and American perspectives, the history of the Portsmouth Treaty and its relevance to current issues involving the Northern Pacific region. The forum is intended to focus modern scholarship on international problems in the &quot;spirit of the Portsmouth Peace Treaty.&quot;

<text>An aurora ( aurorae or auroras),
also commonly known as the northern lights (aurora borealis) or southern lights (aurora australis), is a natural light display in Earth&#x27;s sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic). Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.

Auroras are the result of disturbances in the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere caused by the solar wind. Major disturbances result from enhancements in the speed of the solar wind from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections. These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere). The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying colour and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles.

Planets in the Solar System, brown dwarfs, comets, and some natural satellites also host auroras. 

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;aurora borealis&quot; was coined by Galileo Galilei in 1619, from the Roman Aurora, goddess of the dawn, and the Greek Boreas, god of the cold north wind.

The word &quot;aurora&quot; is derived from the name of the Roman goddess of the dawn, Aurora, who travelled from east to west announcing the coming of the Sun. &quot;Aurora&quot; was first used in English in the 14th century. The words &quot;borealis&quot; and &quot;australis&quot; are derived from the names of the ancient gods of the north wind (Boreas) and the south wind (Auster or &quot;australis&quot;) in Greco-Roman mythology.

&quot;Aurora borealis&quot; was first used to describe the northern lights by the French philosopher, Pierre Gassendi (also called Petrus Gassendus) in 1621, then entered English in 1828.

== Occurrence ==

Auroras are most commonly observed in the &quot;auroral zone&quot;, a band approximately 6° (~660 km) wide in latitude centered on 67° north and south. The region that currently displays an aurora is called the &quot;auroral oval&quot;. The oval is displaced by the solar wind, pushing it about 15° away from the geomagnetic pole (not the geographic pole) in the noon direction and 23° away in the midnight direction. The peak equatorward extent of the oval is displaced slightly from geographic midnight. It is centered about 3–5° nightward of the magnetic pole, so that auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator when the magnetic pole in question is in between the observer and the Sun, which is called magnetic midnight.

Early evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the statistics of auroral observations. Elias Loomis (1860), and later Hermann Fritz (1881) and Sophus Tromholt (1881) in more detail, established that the aurora appeared mainly in the auroral zone.

In northern latitudes, the effect is known as the aurora borealis or the northern lights. The southern counterpart, the aurora australis or the southern lights, has features almost identical to the aurora borealis and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern auroral zone. The aurora australis is visible from high southern latitudes in Antarctica, the Southern Cone, South Africa, Australasia, the Falkland Islands, and under exceptional circumstances as far north as Uruguay. The aurora borealis is visible from areas around the Arctic such as Alaska, Canada, Iceland, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Scandinavia, Finland, Scotland, and Russia. A geomagnetic storm causes the auroral ovals (north and south) to expand, bringing the aurora to lower latitudes. On rare occasions, the aurora borealis can be seen as far south as the Mediterranean and the southern states of the US while the aurora australis can be seen as far north as New Caledonia and the Pilbara region in Western Australia. During the Carrington Event, the greatest geomagnetic storm ever observed, auroras were seen even in the tropics.

Auroras seen within the auroral oval may be directly overhead. From farther away, they illuminate the poleward horizon as a greenish glow, or sometimes a faint red, as if the Sun were rising from an unusual direction. Auroras also occur poleward of the auroral zone as either diffuse patches or arcs, which can be subvisual.


Auroras are occasionally seen in latitudes below the auroral zone, when a geomagnetic storm temporarily enlarges the auroral oval. Large geomagnetic storms are most common during the peak of the 11-year sunspot cycle or during the three years after the peak. An electron spirals (gyrates) about a field line at an angle that is determined by its velocity vectors, parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the local geomagnetic field vector B. This angle is known as the &quot;pitch angle&quot; of the particle. The distance, or radius, of the electron from the field line at any time is known as its Larmor radius. The pitch angle increases as the electron travels to a region of greater field strength nearer to the atmosphere. Thus, it is possible for some particles to return, or mirror, if the angle becomes 90° before entering the atmosphere to collide with the denser molecules there. Other particles that do not mirror enter the atmosphere and contribute to the auroral display over a range of altitudes. Other types of auroras have been observed from space; for example, &quot;poleward arcs&quot; stretching sunward across the polar cap, the related &quot;theta aurora&quot;, and &quot;dayside arcs&quot; near noon. These are relatively infrequent and poorly understood. Other interesting effects occur such as pulsating aurora, &quot;black aurora&quot; and their rarer companion &quot;anti-black aurora&quot; and subvisual red arcs. In addition to all these, a weak glow (often deep red) observed around the two polar cusps, the field lines separating the ones that close through Earth from those that are swept into the tail and close remotely.

=== Images ===
Early work on the imaging of the auroras was done in 1949 by the University of Saskatchewan using the SCR-270 radar. The altitudes where auroral emissions occur were revealed by Carl Størmer and his colleagues, who used cameras to triangulate more than 12,000 auroras. They discovered that most of the light is produced between above the ground, while extending at times to more than .

=== Forms ===
According to Clark (2007), there are five main forms that can be seen from the ground, from least to most visible:

* A mild &quot;glow&quot;, near the horizon. These can be close to the limit of visibility, but can be distinguished from moonlit clouds because stars can be seen undiminished through the glow.
* &quot;Patches&quot; or &quot;surfaces&quot; that look like clouds.
* &quot;Arcs&quot; curve across the sky.
* &quot;Rays&quot; are light and dark stripes across arcs, reaching upwards by various amounts.
* &quot;Coronas&quot; cover much of the sky and diverge from one point on it.

Brekke (1994) also described some auroras as &quot;curtains&quot;. The similarity to curtains is often enhanced by folds within the arcs. Arcs can fragment or break up into separate, at times rapidly changing, often rayed features that may fill the whole sky. These are also known as &quot;discrete auroras&quot;, which are at times bright enough to read a newspaper by at night.

These forms are consistent with auroras being shaped by Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. The appearances of arcs, rays, curtains, and coronas are determined by the shapes of the luminous parts of the atmosphere and a viewer&#x27;s position.

=== Colours and wavelengths of auroral light ===

* Red: At its highest altitudes, excited atomic oxygen emits at 630 nm (red); low concentration of atoms and lower sensitivity of eyes at this wavelength make this colour visible only under more intense solar activity. The low number of oxygen atoms and their gradually diminishing concentration is responsible for the faint appearance of the top parts of the &quot;curtains&quot;. Scarlet, crimson, and carmine are the most often-seen hues of red for the auroras.
* Green: At lower altitudes, the more frequent collisions suppress the 630 nm (red) mode: rather the 557.7 nm emission (green) dominates. A fairly high concentration of atomic oxygen and higher eye sensitivity in green make green auroras the most common. The excited molecular nitrogen (atomic nitrogen being rare due to the high stability of the N2 molecule) plays a role here, as it can transfer energy by collision to an oxygen atom, which then radiates it away at the green wavelength. (Red and green can also mix together to produce pink or yellow hues.) The rapid decrease of concentration of atomic oxygen below about 100 km is responsible for the abrupt-looking end of the lower edges of the curtains. Both the 557.7 and 630.0 nm wavelengths correspond to forbidden transitions of atomic oxygen, a slow mechanism responsible for the graduality (0.7 s and 107 s respectively) of flaring and fading.
* Blue: At yet lower altitudes, atomic oxygen is uncommon, and molecular nitrogen and ionized molecular nitrogen take over in producing visible light emission, radiating at a large number of wavelengths in both red and blue parts of the spectrum, with 428 nm (blue) being dominant. Blue and purple emissions, typically at the lower edges of the &quot;curtains&quot;, show up at the highest levels of solar activity. The molecular nitrogen transitions are much faster than the atomic oxygen ones.
* Ultraviolet: Ultraviolet radiation from auroras (within the optical window but not visible to virtually all humans) has been observed with the requisite equipment. Ultraviolet auroras have also been seen on Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.
* Infrared: Infrared radiation, in wavelengths that are within the optical window, is also part of many auroras.
* Yellow and pink are a mix of red and green or blue. Other shades of red, as well as orange and gold, may be seen on rare occasions; yellow-green is moderately common. As red, green, and blue are linearly independent colours, additive synthesis could, in theory, produce most human-perceived colours, but the ones mentioned in this article comprise a virtually exhaustive list.

=== Changes with time ===

Auroras change with time. Over the night they begin with glows and progress toward coronas, although they may not reach them. They tend to fade in the opposite order. Until about 1963, it was thought that these changes are due to the rotation of the Earth under a pattern fixed with respect to the Sun. Later, it was found by comparing all-sky films of auroras from different places (collected during the International Geophysical Year) that they often undergo global changes in a process called auroral substorm. They change in a few minutes from quiet arcs all along the auroral oval to active displays along the darkside and after 1–3 hours they gradually change back. Changes in auroras over time are commonly visualized using keograms.

At shorter time scales, auroras can change their appearances and intensity, sometimes so slowly as to be difficult to notice, and at other times rapidly down to the sub-second scale. The phenomenon of pulsating auroras is an example of intensity variations over short timescales, typically with periods of 2–20 seconds. This type of aurora is generally accompanied by decreasing peak emission heights of about 8 km for blue and green emissions and above average solar wind speeds ().

=== Other auroral radiation ===
In addition, the aurora and associated currents produce a strong radio emission around 150 kHz known as auroral kilometric radiation (AKR), discovered in 1972. Ionospheric absorption makes AKR only observable from space. X-ray emissions, originating from the particles associated with auroras, have also been detected.

=== Noise ===
Aurora noise, similar to a crackling noise, begins about above Earth&#x27;s surface and is caused by charged particles in an inversion layer of the atmosphere formed during a cold night. The charged particles discharge when particles from the Sun hit the inversion layer, creating the noise.

=== Unusual types ===

==== STEVE ====
In 2016, more than fifty citizen science observations described what was to them an unknown type of aurora which they named &quot;STEVE&quot;, for &quot;Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement&quot;. STEVE is not an aurora but is caused by a wide ribbon of hot plasma at an altitude of , with a temperature of and flowing at a speed of (compared to outside the ribbon).

==== Picket-fence aurora ====

The processes that cause STEVE are also associated with a picket-fence aurora, although the latter can be seen without STEVE. It is an aurora because it is caused by precipitation of electrons in the atmosphere but it appears outside the auroral oval, closer to the equator than typical auroras. When the picket-fence aurora appears with STEVE, it is below.

==== Dune aurora ====

First reported in 2020, and confirmed in 2021, the dune aurora phenomenon was discovered by Finnish citizen scientists. It consists of regularly-spaced, parallel stripes of brighter emission in the green diffuse aurora which give the impression of sand dunes. The phenomenon is believed to be caused by the modulation of atomic oxygen density by a large-scale atmospheric wave travelling horizontally in a waveguide through an inversion layer in the mesosphere in presence of electron precipitation.

==== Horse-collar aurora ====

Horse-collar auroras (HCA) are auroral features in which the auroral ellipse shifts poleward during the dawn and dusk portions and the polar cap becomes teardrop-shaped. They form during periods when the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is permanently northward, when the IMF clock angle is small. Their formation is associated with the closure of the magnetic flux at the top of the dayside magnetosphere by the double lobe reconnection (DLR). There are approximately 8 HCA events per month, with no seasonal dependence, and that the IMF must be within 30 degrees of northwards.

==== Conjugate auroras ====
Conjugate auroras are nearly exact mirror-image auroras found at conjugate points in the northern and southern hemispheres on the same geomagnetic field lines. These generally happen at the time of the equinoxes, when there is little difference in the orientation of the north and south geomagnetic poles to the sun. Attempts were made to image conjugate auroras by aircraft from Alaska and New Zealand in 1967, 1968, 1970, and 1971, with some success.

== Causes ==
A full understanding of the physical processes which lead to different types of auroras is still incomplete, but the basic cause involves the interaction of the solar wind with Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere. The varying intensity of the solar wind produces effects of different magnitudes but includes one or more of the following physical scenarios.
# A quiescent solar wind flowing past Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere steadily interacts with it and can both inject solar wind particles directly onto the geomagnetic field lines that are &#x27;open&#x27;, as opposed to being &#x27;closed&#x27; in the opposite hemisphere and provide diffusion through the bow shock. It can also cause particles already trapped in the radiation belts to precipitate into the atmosphere. Once particles are lost to the atmosphere from the radiation belts, under quiet conditions, new ones replace them only slowly, and the loss-cone becomes depleted. In the magnetotail, however, particle trajectories seem constantly to reshuffle, probably when the particles cross the very weak magnetic field near the equator. As a result, the flow of electrons in that region is nearly the same in all directions (&quot;isotropic&quot;) and assures a steady supply of leaking electrons. The leakage of electrons does not leave the tail positively charged, because each leaked electron lost to the atmosphere is replaced by a low energy electron drawn upward from the ionosphere. Such replacement of &quot;hot&quot; electrons by &quot;cold&quot; ones is in complete accord with the second law of thermodynamics. The complete process, which also generates an electric ring current around Earth, is uncertain.
# Geomagnetic disturbance from an enhanced solar wind causes distortions of the magnetotail (&quot;magnetic substorms&quot;). These &#x27;substorms&#x27; tend to occur after prolonged spells (on the order of hours) during which the interplanetary magnetic field has had an appreciable southward component. This leads to a higher rate of interconnection between its field lines and those of Earth. As a result, the solar wind moves magnetic flux (tubes of magnetic field lines, &#x27;locked&#x27; together with their resident plasma) from the day side of Earth to the magnetotail, widening the obstacle it presents to the solar wind flow and constricting the tail on the night-side. Ultimately some tail plasma can separate (&quot;magnetic reconnection&quot;); some blobs (&quot;plasmoids&quot;) are squeezed downstream and are carried away with the solar wind; others are squeezed toward Earth where their motion feeds strong outbursts of auroras, mainly around midnight (&quot;unloading process&quot;). A geomagnetic storm resulting from greater interaction adds many more particles to the plasma trapped around Earth, also producing enhancement of the &quot;ring current&quot;. Occasionally the resulting modification of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field can be so strong that it produces auroras visible at middle latitudes, on field lines much closer to the equator than those of the auroral zone.
# Acceleration of auroral charged particles invariably accompanies a magnetospheric disturbance that causes an aurora. This mechanism, which is believed to predominantly arise from strong electric fields along the magnetic field or wave-particle interactions, raises the velocity of a particle in the direction of the guiding magnetic field. The pitch angle is thereby decreased and increases the chance of it being precipitated into the atmosphere. Both electromagnetic and electrostatic waves, produced at the time of greater geomagnetic disturbances, make a significant contribution to the energizing processes that sustain an aurora. Particle acceleration provides a complex intermediate process for transferring energy from the solar wind indirectly into the atmosphere.

The details of these phenomena are not fully understood. However, it is clear that the prime source of auroral particles is the solar wind feeding the magnetosphere, the reservoir containing the radiation zones and temporarily magnetically trapped particles confined by the geomagnetic field, coupled with particle acceleration processes.

=== Auroral particles ===
The immediate cause of the ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents leading to auroral emissions was discovered in 1960, when a pioneering rocket flight from Fort Churchill in Canada revealed a flux of electrons entering the atmosphere from above. Since then an extensive collection of measurements has been acquired painstakingly and with steadily improving resolution since the 1960s by many research teams using rockets and satellites to traverse the auroral zone. The main findings have been that auroral arcs and other bright forms are due to electrons that have been accelerated during the final few 10,000 km or so of their plunge into the atmosphere. These electrons often, but not always, exhibit a peak in their energy distribution, and are preferentially aligned along the local direction of the magnetic field.

Electrons mainly responsible for diffuse and pulsating auroras have, in contrast, a smoothly falling energy distribution, and an angular (pitch-angle) distribution favouring directions perpendicular to the local magnetic field. Pulsations were discovered to originate at or close to the equatorial crossing point of auroral zone magnetic field lines. Protons are also associated with auroras, both discrete and diffuse.

=== Atmosphere ===
Auroras result from emissions of photons in Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere, above , from ionized nitrogen atoms regaining an electron, and oxygen atoms and nitrogen based molecules returning from an excited state to ground state. They are ionized or excited by the collision of particles precipitated into the atmosphere. Both incoming electrons and protons may be involved. Excitation energy is lost within the atmosphere by the emission of a photon, or by collision with another atom or molecule:
;Oxygen emissions: green or orange-red, depending on the amount of energy absorbed.
;Nitrogen emissions:blue, purple or red; blue and purple if the molecule regains an electron after it has been ionized, red if returning to ground state from an excited state.

Oxygen is unusual in terms of its return to ground state: it can take 0.7 seconds to emit the 557.7 nm green light and up to two minutes for the red 630.0 nm emission. Collisions with other atoms or molecules absorb the excitation energy and prevent emission; this process is called collisional quenching. Because the highest parts of the atmosphere contain a higher percentage of oxygen and lower particle densities, such collisions are rare enough to allow time for oxygen to emit red light. Collisions become more frequent progressing down into the atmosphere due to increasing density, so that red emissions do not have time to happen, and eventually, even green light emissions are prevented.

This is why there is a colour differential with altitude; at high altitudes oxygen red dominates, then oxygen green and nitrogen blue/purple/red, then finally nitrogen blue/purple/red when collisions prevent oxygen from emitting anything. Green is the most common colour. Then comes pink, a mixture of light green and red, followed by pure red, then yellow (a mixture of red and green), and finally, pure blue.

Precipitating protons generally produce optical emissions as incident hydrogen atoms after gaining electrons from the atmosphere. Proton auroras are usually observed at lower latitudes.

=== Ionosphere ===
Bright auroras are generally associated with Birkeland currents (Schield et al., 1969; Zmuda and Armstrong, 1973), which flow down into the ionosphere on one side of the pole and out on the other. In between, some of the current connects directly through the ionospheric E layer (125 km); the rest (&quot;region 2&quot;) detours, leaving again through field lines closer to the equator and closing through the &quot;partial ring current&quot; carried by magnetically trapped plasma. The ionosphere is an ohmic conductor, so some consider that such currents require a driving voltage, which an, as yet unspecified, dynamo mechanism can supply. Electric field probes in orbit above the polar cap suggest voltages of the order of 40,000 volts, rising up to more than 200,000 volts during intense magnetic storms. In another interpretation, the currents are the direct result of electron acceleration into the atmosphere by wave/particle interactions.

Ionospheric resistance has a complex nature, and leads to a secondary Hall current flow. By a strange twist of physics, the magnetic disturbance on the ground due to the main current almost cancels out, so most of the observed effect of auroras is due to a secondary current, the auroral electrojet. An auroral electrojet index (measured in nanotesla) is regularly derived from ground data and serves as a general measure of auroral activity. Kristian Birkeland deduced that the currents flowed in the east–west directions along the auroral arc, and such currents, flowing from the dayside toward (approximately) midnight were later named &quot;auroral electrojets&quot; (see also Birkeland currents). Ionosphere can contribute to the formation of auroral arcs via the feedback instability under high ionospheric resistance conditions, observed at night time and in dark Winter hemisphere.

== Interaction of the solar wind with Earth ==
Earth is constantly immersed in the solar wind, a flow of magnetized hot plasma (a gas of free electrons and positive ions) emitted by the Sun in all directions, a result of the two-million-degree temperature of the Sun&#x27;s outermost layer, the corona. The solar wind reaches Earth with a velocity typically around 400 km/s, a density of around 5 ions/cm3 and a magnetic field intensity of around 2–5 nT (for comparison, Earth&#x27;s surface field is typically 30,000–50,000 nT). During magnetic storms, in particular, flows can be several times faster; the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) may also be much stronger. Joan Feynman deduced in the 1970s that the long-term averages of solar wind speed correlated with geomagnetic activity. Her work resulted from data collected by the Explorer 33 spacecraft.

The solar wind and magnetosphere consist of plasma (ionized gas), which conducts electricity. It is well known (since Michael Faraday&#x27;s work around 1830) that when an electrical conductor is placed within a magnetic field while relative motion occurs in a direction that the conductor cuts &quot;across&quot; (or is cut &quot;by&quot;), rather than &quot;along&quot;, the lines of the magnetic field, an electric current is induced within the conductor. The strength of the current depends on a) the rate of relative motion, b) the strength of the magnetic field, c) the number of conductors ganged together and d) the distance between the conductor and the magnetic field, while the &quot;direction&quot; of flow is dependent upon the direction of relative motion. Dynamos make use of this basic process (&quot;the dynamo effect&quot;), any and all conductors, solid or otherwise are so affected, including plasmas and other fluids.

The IMF originates on the Sun, linked to the sunspots, and its field lines (lines of force) are dragged out by the solar wind. That alone would tend to line them up in the Sun-Earth direction, but the rotation of the Sun angles them at Earth by about 45 degrees forming a spiral in the ecliptic plane, known as the Parker spiral. The field lines passing Earth are therefore usually linked to those near the western edge (&quot;limb&quot;) of the visible Sun at any time.

The solar wind and the magnetosphere, being two electrically conducting fluids in relative motion, should be able in principle to generate electric currents by dynamo action and impart energy from the flow of the solar wind. However, this process is hampered by the fact that plasmas conduct readily along magnetic field lines, but less readily perpendicular to them. Energy is more effectively transferred by the temporary magnetic connection between the field lines of the solar wind and those of the magnetosphere. Unsurprisingly this process is known as magnetic reconnection. As already mentioned, it happens most readily when the interplanetary field is directed southward, in a similar direction to the geomagnetic field in the inner regions of both the north magnetic pole and south magnetic pole.

Auroras are more frequent and brighter during the intense phase of the solar cycle when coronal mass ejections increase the intensity of the solar wind.

=== Magnetosphere ===
Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere is shaped by the impact of the solar wind on Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. This forms an obstacle to the flow, diverting it, at an average distance of about 70,000 km (11 Earth radii or Re), producing a bow shock 12,000 km to 15,000 km (1.9 to 2.4 Re) further upstream. The width of the magnetosphere abreast of Earth is typically 190,000 km (30 Re), and on the night side a long &quot;magnetotail&quot; of stretched field lines extends to great distances (&gt; 200 Re).

The high latitude magnetosphere is filled with plasma as the solar wind passes Earth. The flow of plasma into the magnetosphere increases with additional turbulence, density, and speed in the solar wind. This flow is favoured by a southward component of the IMF, which can then directly connect to the high latitude geomagnetic field lines. The flow pattern of magnetospheric plasma is mainly from the magnetotail toward Earth, around Earth and back into the solar wind through the magnetopause on the day-side. In addition to moving perpendicular to Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, some magnetospheric plasma travels down along Earth&#x27;s magnetic field lines, gains additional energy and loses it to the atmosphere in the auroral zones. The cusps of the magnetosphere, separating geomagnetic field lines that close through Earth from those that close remotely allow a small amount of solar wind to directly reach the top of the atmosphere, producing an auroral glow.

On 26 February 2008, THEMIS probes were able to determine, for the first time, the triggering event for the onset of magnetospheric substorms. Two of the five probes, positioned approximately one third the distance to the Moon, measured events suggesting a magnetic reconnection event 96 seconds prior to auroral intensification.

Geomagnetic storms that ignite auroras may occur more often during the months around the equinoxes. It is not well understood, but geomagnetic storms may vary with Earth&#x27;s seasons. Two factors to consider are the tilt of both the solar and Earth&#x27;s axis to the ecliptic plane. As Earth orbits throughout a year, it experiences an interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) from different latitudes of the Sun, which is tilted at 8 degrees. Similarly, the 23-degree tilt of Earth&#x27;s axis about which the geomagnetic pole rotates with a diurnal variation changes the daily average angle that the geomagnetic field presents to the incident IMF throughout a year. These factors combined can lead to minor cyclical changes in the detailed way that the IMF links to the magnetosphere. In turn, this affects the average probability of opening a door through which energy from the solar wind can reach Earth&#x27;s inner magnetosphere and thereby enhance auroras. Recent evidence in 2021 has shown that individual separate substorms may in fact be correlated networked communities.

== Auroral particle acceleration ==

Just as there are many types of aurora, there are many different mechanisms that accelerate auroral particles into the atmosphere. Electron aurora in Earth&#x27;s auroral zone (i.e. commonly visible aurora) can be split into two main categories with different immediate causes: diffuse and discrete aurora. Diffuse aurora appear relatively structureless to an observer on the ground, with indistinct edges and amorphous forms. Discrete aurora are structured into distinct features with well-defined edges such as arcs, rays and coronas; they also tend to be much brighter than the diffuse aurora.

In both cases, the electrons that eventually cause the aurora start out as electrons trapped by the magnetic field in Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere. These trapped particles bounce back and forth along magnetic field lines and are prevented from hitting the atmosphere by the magnetic mirror formed by the increasing magnetic field strength closer to Earth. The magnetic mirror&#x27;s ability to trap a particle depends on the particle&#x27;s pitch angle: the angle between its direction of motion and the local magnetic field. An aurora is created by processes that decrease the pitch angle of many individual electrons, freeing them from the magnetic trap and causing them to hit the atmosphere.

In the case of diffuse auroras, the electron pitch angles are altered by their interaction with various plasma waves. Each interaction is essentially wave-particle scattering; the electron energy after interacting with the wave is similar to its energy before interaction, but the direction of motion is altered. If the final direction of motion after scattering is close to the field line (specifically, if it falls within the loss cone) then the electron will hit the atmosphere. Diffuse auroras are caused by the collective effect of many such scattered electrons hitting the atmosphere. The process is mediated by the plasma waves, which become stronger during periods of high geomagnetic activity, leading to increased diffuse aurora at those times.

In the case of discrete auroras, the trapped electrons are accelerated toward Earth by electric fields that form at an altitude of about 4000–12000 km in the &quot;auroral acceleration region&quot;. The electric fields point away from Earth (i.e. upward) along the magnetic field line. Electrons moving downward through these fields gain a substantial amount of energy (on the order of a few keV) in the direction along the magnetic field line toward Earth. This field-aligned acceleration decreases the pitch angle for all of the electrons passing through the region, causing many of them to hit the upper atmosphere. In contrast to the scattering process leading to diffuse auroras, the electric field increases the kinetic energy of all of the electrons transiting downward through the acceleration region by the same amount. This accelerates electrons starting from the magnetosphere with initially low energies (tens of eV or less) to energies required to create an aurora (100s of eV or greater), allowing that large source of particles to contribute to creating auroral light.

The accelerated electrons carry an electric current along the magnetic field lines (a Birkeland current). Since the electric field points in the same direction as the current, there is a net conversion of electromagnetic energy into particle energy in the auroral acceleration region (an electric load). The energy to power this load is eventually supplied by the magnetized solar wind flowing around the obstacle of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, although exactly how that power flows through the magnetosphere is still an active area of research. While the energy to power the aurora is ultimately derived from the solar wind, the electrons themselves do not travel directly from the solar wind into Earth&#x27;s auroral zone; magnetic field lines from these regions do not connect to the solar wind, so there is no direct access for solar wind electrons.

Some auroral features are also created by electrons accelerated by dispersive Alfvén waves. At small wavelengths transverse to the background magnetic field (comparable to the electron inertial length or ion gyroradius), Alfvén waves develop a significant electric field parallel to the background magnetic field. This electric field can accelerate electrons to keV energies, significant to produce auroral arcs. If the electrons have a speed close to that of the wave&#x27;s phase velocity, they are accelerated in a manner analogous to a surfer catching an ocean wave. This constantly-changing wave electric field can accelerate electrons along the field line, causing some of them to hit the atmosphere. Electrons accelerated by this mechanism tend to have a broad energy spectrum, in contrast to the sharply-peaked energy spectrum typical of electrons accelerated by quasi-static electric fields.

In addition to the discrete and diffuse electron aurora, proton aurora is caused when magnetospheric protons collide with the upper atmosphere. The proton gains an electron in the interaction, and the resulting neutral hydrogen atom emits photons. The resulting light is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. Other aurora not covered by the above discussion include transpolar arcs (formed poleward of the auroral zone), cusp aurora (formed in two small high-latitude areas on the dayside) and some non-terrestrial auroras.

== Historically significant events ==
The discovery of a 1770 Japanese diary in 2017 depicting auroras above the ancient Japanese capital of Kyoto suggested that the storm may have been 7% larger than the Carrington event, which affected telegraph networks.

The auroras that resulted from the Carrington event on both 28 August and 2 September 1859, are thought to be the most spectacular in recent history. In a paper to the Royal Society on 21 November 1861, Balfour Stewart described both auroral events as documented by a self-recording magnetograph at the Kew Observatory and established the connection between the 2 September 1859 auroral storm and the Carrington–Hodgson flare event when he observed that &quot;It is not impossible to suppose that in this case our luminary was taken &quot;in the act&quot;.&quot; The second auroral event, which occurred on 2 September 1859, was a result of the (unseen) coronal mass ejection associated with the exceptionally intense Carrington–Hodgson white light solar flare on 1 September 1859. This event produced auroras so widespread and extraordinarily bright that they were seen and reported in published scientific measurements, ship logs, and newspapers throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and Australia. It was reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot; that in Boston on Friday 2 September 1859 the aurora was &quot;so brilliant that at about one o&#x27;clock ordinary print could be read by the light&quot;. One o&#x27;clock EST time on Friday 2 September would have been 6:00 GMT; the self-recording magnetograph at the Kew Observatory was recording the geomagnetic storm, which was then one hour old, at its full intensity. Between 1859 and 1862, Elias Loomis published a series of nine papers on the Great Auroral Exhibition of 1859 in the &quot;American Journal of Science&quot; where he collected worldwide reports of the auroral event.

That aurora is thought to have been produced by one of the most intense coronal mass ejections in history. It is also notable for the fact that it is the first time where the phenomena of auroral activity and electricity were unambiguously linked. This insight was made possible not only due to scientific magnetometer measurements of the era, but also as a result of a significant portion of the of telegraph lines then in service being significantly disrupted for many hours throughout the storm. Some telegraph lines, however, seem to have been of the appropriate length and orientation to produce a sufficient geomagnetically induced current from the electromagnetic field to allow for continued communication with the telegraph operator power supplies switched off. The following conversation occurred between two operators of the American Telegraph Line between Boston and Portland, Maine, on the night of 2 September 1859 and reported in the &quot;Boston Traveller&quot;:

The conversation was carried on for around two hours using no battery power at all and working solely with the current induced by the aurora, and it was said that this was the first time on record that more than a word or two was transmitted in such manner. Such events led to the general conclusion that

In May 2024, a series of solar storms caused the aurora borealis to be observed from as far south as Ferdows, Iran.

== Historical views and folklore ==

The earliest datable record of an aurora was recorded in the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot;, a historical chronicle of the history of ancient China, in 977 or 957 BC.
An aurora was described by the Greek explorer Pytheas in the 4th century BC. Seneca wrote about auroras in the first book of his &quot;Naturales Quaestiones&quot;, classifying them, for instance, as (&#x27;barrel-like&#x27;); (&#x27;chasm&#x27;); (&#x27;bearded&#x27;); (&#x27;like cypress trees&#x27;); and describing their manifold colours. He wrote about whether they were above or below the clouds, and recalled that under Tiberius, an aurora formed above the port city of Ostia that was so intense and red that a cohort of the army, stationed nearby for fire duty, galloped to the rescue. It has been suggested that Pliny the Elder depicted the aurora borealis in his &quot;Natural History&quot;, when he refers to , , &quot;falling red flames&quot;, and &quot;daylight in the night&quot;.

The earliest depiction of the aurora may have been in Cro-Magnon cave paintings of northern Spain dating to 30,000 BC.

The oldest known written record of the aurora was in a Chinese legend written around 2600 BC. On an autumn around 2000 BC, according to a legend, a young woman named Fubao was sitting alone in the wilderness by a bay, when suddenly a &quot;magical band of light&quot; appeared like &quot;moving clouds and flowing water&quot;, turning into a bright halo around the Big Dipper, which cascaded a pale silver brilliance, illuminating the earth and making shapes and shadows seem alive. Moved by this sight, Fubao became pregnant and gave birth to a son, the Emperor Xuanyuan, known legendarily as the initiator of Chinese culture and the ancestor of all Chinese people. In the , a creature named is described to be like a red dragon shining in the night sky with a body a thousand miles long. In ancient times, the Chinese did not have a fixed word for the aurora, so it was named according to the different shapes of the aurora, such as &quot;Sky Dog&quot; (), &quot;Sword/Knife Star&quot; (), &quot;Chiyou banner&quot; (), &quot;Sky&#x27;s Open Eyes&quot; (), and &quot;Stars like Rain&quot; ().

In Japanese folklore, pheasants were considered messengers from heaven. However, researchers from Japan&#x27;s Graduate University for Advanced Studies and National Institute of Polar Research claimed in March 2020 that red pheasant tails witnessed across the night sky over Japan in 620 A.D., might be a red aurora produced during a magnetic storm.
In the traditions of Aboriginal Australians, the Aurora Australis is commonly associated with fire. For example, the Gunditjmara people of western Victoria called auroras (&#x27;ashes&#x27;), while the Gunai people of eastern Victoria perceived auroras as bushfires in the spirit world. The Dieri people of South Australia say that an auroral display is , an evil spirit creating a large fire. Similarly, the Ngarrindjeri people of South Australia refer to auroras seen over Kangaroo Island as the campfires of spirits in the &#x27;Land of the Dead&#x27;. Aboriginal people in southwest Queensland believe the auroras to be the fires of the &quot;Oola Pikka&quot;, ghostly spirits who spoke to the people through auroras. Sacred law forbade anyone except male elders from watching or interpreting the messages of ancestors they believed were transmitted through an aurora.

Among the Māori people of New Zealand, aurora australis or (&quot;great torches in the sky&quot;) were lit by ancestors who sailed south to a &quot;land of ice&quot; (or their descendants); these people were said to be Ui-te-Rangiora&#x27;s expedition party who had reached the Southern Ocean. around the 7th century.
In Scandinavia, the first mention of (the northern lights) is found in the Norwegian chronicle from AD 1230. The chronicler has heard about this phenomenon from compatriots returning from Greenland, and he gives three possible explanations: that the ocean was surrounded by vast fires; that the sun flares could reach around the world to its night side; or that glaciers could store energy so that they eventually became fluorescent.

Walter William Bryant wrote in his book (1920) that Tycho Brahe &quot;seems to have been something of a homoeopathist, for he recommends sulfur to cure infectious diseases &#x27;brought on by the sulfurous vapours of the Aurora Borealis.

In 1778, Benjamin Franklin theorized in his paper &quot;Aurora Borealis, Suppositions and Conjectures towards forming an Hypothesis for its Explanation&quot; that an aurora was caused by a concentration of electrical charge in the polar regions intensified by the snow and moisture in the air:

Observations of the rhythmic movement of compass needles due to the influence of an aurora were confirmed in the Swedish city of Uppsala by Anders Celsius and Olof Hiorter. In 1741, Hiorter was able to link large magnetic fluctuation to the observation of an aurora overhead. This evidence helped to support their theory that &#x27;magnetic storms&#x27; are responsible for such compass fluctuations.
A variety of Native American myths surround the spectacle. The European explorer Samuel Hearne travelled with Chipewyan Dene in 1771 and recorded their views on the (&#x27;caribou&#x27;). According to Hearne, the Dene people saw the resemblance between an aurora and the sparks produced when caribou fur is stroked. They believed that the lights were the spirits of their departed friends dancing in the sky, and when they shone brightly it meant that their deceased friends were very happy.

During the night after the Battle of Fredericksburg, an aurora was seen from the battlefield. The Confederate Army took this as a sign that God was on their side, as the lights were rarely seen so far south. The painting &quot;Aurora Borealis&quot; by Frederic Edwin Church is widely interpreted to represent the conflict of the American Civil War.

A mid 19th-century British source says auroras were a rare occurrence before the 18th century. It quotes Halley as saying that before the aurora of 1716, no such phenomenon had been recorded for more than 80 years, and none of any consequence since 1574. It says no appearance is recorded in the &quot;Transactions of the French Academy of Sciences&quot; between 1666 and 1716; and that one aurora recorded in &quot;Berlin Miscellany&quot; for 1797 was called a very rare event. One observed in 1723 at Bologna was stated to be the first ever seen there. Celsius (1733) states the oldest residents of Uppsala thought the phenomenon a great rarity before 1716. The period between approximately 1645 and 1715 corresponds to the Maunder minimum in sunspot activity.

In Robert W. Service&#x27;s satirical poem &quot;&quot; (1908), a Yukon prospector discovers that the aurora is the glow from a radium mine. He stakes his claim, then goes to town looking for investors.

In the early 1900s, the Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland laid the foundation for the current understanding of geomagnetism and polar auroras.

In Sami mythology, the northern lights are caused by the deceased who bled to death cutting themselves, their blood spilling on the sky. Many aboriginal peoples of northern Eurasia and North America share similar beliefs of northern lights being the blood of the deceased, some believing they are caused by dead warriors&#x27; blood spraying on the sky as they engage in playing games, riding horses or having fun in some other way.

== Extraterrestrial aurorae ==


Both Jupiter and Saturn have magnetic fields that are stronger than Earth&#x27;s (Jupiter&#x27;s equatorial field strength is 4.3 gauss, compared to 0.3 gauss for Earth), and both have extensive radiation belts. Auroras have been observed on both gas planets, most clearly using the Hubble Space Telescope, and the &quot;Cassini&quot; and &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft, as well as on Uranus and Neptune.

The aurorae on Saturn seem, like Earth&#x27;s, to be powered by the solar wind. However, Jupiter&#x27;s aurorae are more complex. Jupiter&#x27;s main auroral oval is associated with the plasma produced by the volcanic moon Io, and the transport of this plasma within the planet&#x27;s magnetosphere. An uncertain fraction of Jupiter&#x27;s aurorae are powered by the solar wind. In addition, the moons, especially Io, are also powerful sources of aurora. These arise from electric currents along field lines (&quot;field aligned currents&quot;), generated by a dynamo mechanism due to the relative motion between the rotating planet and the moving moon. Io, which has active volcanism and an ionosphere, is a particularly strong source, and its currents also generate radio emissions, which have been studied since 1955. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, auroras over Io, Europa and Ganymede have all been observed.

Auroras have also been observed on Venus and Mars. Venus has no magnetic field and so Venusian auroras appear as bright and diffuse patches of varying shape and intensity, sometimes distributed over the full disc of the planet. A Venusian aurora originates when electrons from the solar wind collide with the night-side atmosphere.

An aurora was detected on Mars, on 14 August 2004, by the SPICAM instrument aboard &quot;Mars Express&quot;. The aurora was located at Terra Cimmeria, in the region of 177° east, 52° south. The total size of the emission region was about 30 km across, and possibly about 8 km high. By analysing a map of crustal magnetic anomalies compiled with data from Mars Global Surveyor, scientists observed that the region of the emissions corresponded to an area where the strongest magnetic field is localized. This correlation indicated that the origin of the light emission was a flux of electrons moving along the crust magnetic lines and exciting the upper atmosphere of Mars.

Between 2014 and 2016, cometary auroras were observed on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko by multiple instruments on the Rosetta spacecraft. The auroras were observed at far-ultraviolet wavelengths. Coma observations revealed atomic emissions of hydrogen and oxygen caused by the photodissociation (not photoionization, like in terrestrial auroras) of water molecules in the comet&#x27;s coma. The interaction of accelerated electrons from the solar wind with gas particles in the coma is responsible for the aurora. Since comet 67P has no magnetic field, the aurora is diffusely spread around the comet.

Exoplanets, such as hot Jupiters, have been suggested to experience ionization in their upper atmospheres and generate an aurora modified by weather in their turbulent tropospheres. However, there is no current detection of an exoplanet aurora.

The first ever extra-solar auroras were discovered in July 2015 over the brown dwarf star LSR J1835+3259. The mainly red aurora was found to be a million times brighter than the northern lights, a result of the charged particles interacting with hydrogen in the atmosphere. It has been speculated that stellar winds may be stripping off material from the surface of the brown dwarf to produce their own electrons. Another possible explanation for the auroras is that an as-yet-undetected body around the dwarf star is throwing off material, as is the case with Jupiter and its moon Io.

<doc id="49662" wikidata="Q207770" url="?curid=49662" title="Pirelli">
<text>Pirelli &amp; C. S.p.A. is an Italian multinational tyre manufacturer based in the city of Milan, Italy. The company, which has been listed on the Borsa Italiana since 1922, is the 5th-largest tyre manufacturer, and is focused on the consumer production of tyres for cars, motorcycles and bicycles. It is present in Europe, the Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, and the post-Soviet states, operating commercially in over 160 countries. It has 19 manufacturing sites, across 13 countries, and a network of around 14,600 distributors and retailers. In 2015, China National Chemical Corp. Ltd. (ChemChina) took controlling interest of Pirelli; with the Chinese state-owned company agreeing to maintain the tyre company&#x27;s ownership structure until 2023.

Pirelli has been sponsoring sport competitions since 1907 and is the exclusive tyre partner and supplier for the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series for 2008–2010, FIA Formula One World Championship for 2011–present and for the FIM World Superbike Championship. Pirelli&#x27;s headquarters are located in Milan&#x27;s Bicocca district. Pirelli is now solely a tyre manufacturing company. In the past, it had been involved in fashion and operated in renewable energy and sustainable mobility.

On 4 October 2017, Pirelli returned to the Milan Stock Exchange after focusing its business on pure consumer products (tyres for car, motorcycles, and bicycles) and related services, and separating the business of industrial tyre. Pirelli&#x27;s eponymous calendar has been published since 1964, and has featured the contributions of many famous photographers over the years such as Helmut Newton, Steve McCurry, Peter Lindbergh, Richard Avedon, Bruce Weber, Herb Rits, and Annie Leibovitz. The company&#x27;s US-based headquarters are located in Rome, Georgia.

==History==
Founded in Milan in 1872 by Giovanni Battista Pirelli (1848–1932), the company initially specialised in rubber and derivative processes and also made scuba diving rebreathers and dry suits used by Italian frogmen during World War II. Thereafter, Pirelli&#x27;s activities were primarily focused on the production of tyre and cables (for energy and telecommunications). In 2005, Pirelli sold its cable division to Goldman Sachs, which changed the new group&#x27;s name to Prysmian. In the 1950s, Alberto Pirelli commissioned the building of a skyscraper, Pirelli Tower, in the same Milanese area that housed the very first Pirelli factory during the 19th century.

In 1974, Pirelli invented the &quot;wide radial tyre&quot;, upon a request from the Lancia rally racing team for a tyre strong enough to withstand the power of the new Lancia Stratos. At that time, racing tyres were either slick tyres made with the cross ply technique (very wide tyres with a reduced sidewall height), or radial tyres, which were too narrow to withstand the Stratos&#x27; power and did not provide enough grip. Both were unusable for the Lancia Stratos, as the radials were destroyed within 10 km, and the slicks too stiff. Lancia asked Pirelli for a solution, and in 1975 Pirelli created a wide tyre with a reduced sidewall height like a slick but with a radial structure. Subsequently, Porsche started using the same tyres with the Porsche 911 Turbo. In 1988, Pirelli acquired the Armstrong Rubber Company, which was headquartered in New Haven, Connecticut, US for $190 million.

In 2000, Pirelli sold its terrestrial fibre optic cables business to Cisco and its optical components operations to Corning, for 5 billion euro. It invested, through Olimpia, part of the resulting liquidity to become a majority shareholder in Telecom Italia in 2001, maintaining this position until 2007. In 2002 the company started a range of Pirelli-branded clothing, watches and eyewear. In 2005, Pirelli sold its Cables, Energy Systems and Telecommunications assets to Goldman Sachs and the newly formed company was named Prysmian. In the same year, 2005, Pirelli opened its first tyre production plant in Shandong province, China. This was the beginning of the group&#x27;s production complex in the country. In 2006, Pirelli chose Slatina for its first tyre production plant in Romania, expanding the facility in 2011.

In 2010, Pirelli completed its conversion to a pure tyre company by selling Pirelli Broadband Solutions and spinning off the real estate assets of Pirelli Re. Fondazione Pirelli was established in the same year to safeguard and celebrate the company&#x27;s past and to promote business culture as an integral part of Italy&#x27;s national cultural assets. In March 2015, it was announced that Pirelli shareholders had accepted a €7.1 billion bid from ChemChina, together with Camfin and LTI, for the company. The transaction was completed and the company was delisted in November 2015. In May 2017, it was announced that Pirelli returns to the world of cycling with a new road cycling tyre range, P ZERO Velo. In September 2017, the company announced its intentions to sell up to 40 per cent of its equity capital in an initial public offering as it plans to return to the Milan stock exchange in October. In March 2019 Pirelli announced a new range of mountain biking tyres, called Scorpion. In 2021, Pirelli introduced 18-inch tyres for the new aerodynamic and technical changes for 2022 in Formula One. As of May 2024, Pirelli has a market capitalisation of $6.69 billion. On May 29, 2024 Silk Road Fund began the total sale of its shareholding.
On May 30, 2024, the share price fell as a result of the sale of the entire stake of Silk Road Fund. While Tronchetti Provera&#x27;s Camfin strengthened its shareholding together with other Italian investors.

The Pirelli Calendar is published annually, featuring actresses and fashion models. The calendar also features the work of fashion photographers, including Richard Avedon, Peter Lindbergh, Annie Leibovitz, and Patrick Demarchelier. The Pirelli &quot;Internet&quot;ional Award is given annually for the best international multimedia involving the communication of science and technology conducted entirely on the Internet. &quot;Power is nothing without control&quot; was the well-known slogan of Pirelli Tyre Company, and was featured in numerous television and print advertisements. Pirelli is the long-serving main sponsor of Italian football club Inter Milan, having sponsored the Italian team since the 1995–96 season.

==Sponsorship==

===Football===
Pirelli has a history of sponsoring football teams. Pirelli is well known for its long-term primary sponsorship of the Italian football club Inter Milan between 1995 and 2021. Pirelli previously appeared as a sponsor on the shirts of the Maltese football club Valletta for a short time. In reference to Brazil striker Ronaldo’s usual goal celebration of both arms outstretched, Pirelli ran a 1998 commercial in which he replaced the figure of Christ from the &quot;Christ the Redeemer&quot; statue that towers over his home city of Rio de Janeiro while in an Inter Milan strip. It was controversial with the Catholic Church.

Pirelli&#x27;s sponsorship of football teams is not limited to Europe, South America is a key market and as a result, successful clubs have also been sponsored by the tyre company. The Brazilian team Palmeiras, Uruguayan team Peñarol and Argentinian side Vélez Sársfield all had Pirelli as a shirt sponsor. When English football club Burton Albion Football Club built their new stadium in 2005, Pirelli became the title sponsor of the new ground. This was because the new stadium, named Pirelli Stadium lies next to the Pirelli factory in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England. In 2009, Pirelli became the title sponsor of the Chinese Super League (CSL), China&#x27;s top-tier football league. In 2012, the company became a major sponsor of the Russian Cup.

===Motorsport===
Pirelli is the event title sponsor of the Spanish and Hungarian Grands Prix and sponsored the 2018 French Grand Prix. The company was the title sponsor of the Pirelli World Challenge from 2011 to 2018. Pirelli supported rally with their FIA Pirelli Star Driver program as an initiative to support young rally drivers. It was the sole supplier in the top tier of World Rally Championship in 2008–2010, and is now a co-supplier with Michelin. Since its first involvement in WRC in 1973, the manufacturer won 181 events, and produced 25 WRC Driver Champions including Colin McRae (1995), Petter Solberg (2003), Sebastien Loeb (2008–2010). Pirelli would again become the sole tyre supplier in all three tiers in 2021. Pirelli has also been a sponsor of rally and the late gymkhana driver Ken Block&#x27;s Hoonigan Racing Division since 2010.

=== America&#x27;s Cup ===
Pirelli was sponsor of Emirates Team New Zealand in the 35th America&#x27;s Cup (2017).

=== Winter Sports ===
Pirelli sponsored Alpine World Ski Championship and Ice Hockey World Championship IIHF from 2017 to 2021. The company is also sponsor of the Italian Ski Team and of the Swiss Ski Team.

===Baseball===
Pirelli also was a sponsor of the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball from 2014 to 2020.

==Motorsport==

Pirelli was the official tyre partner and supplier of the World Rally Championship from 2008 to 2010 until the company withdrew to focus on its Formula One commitments. Pirelli returned to the championship in 2014, albeit only partnering tyres for a few private teams as Michelin was the major tyre partner and supplier. Pirelli stepped up their involvement in the championship when they signed a deal to supply tyres to all Junior WRC participants, with its champions receiving a Ford Fiesta R5 with free tyres, fuel and free rally registration package for the next season&#x27;s World Rally Championship-2. Pirelli subsequently returned full time to the WRC since 2021 season. Pirelli was also partnered Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series from 2008 until 2010 before being replaced by Continental AG in 2011. The company has been the official supplier of the GT World Challenge America since 2011 and the GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup since 2013.

=== Formula One ===
Pirelli has been the sole tyre supplier in Formula One since 2011 following Bridgestone&#x27;s decision to withdraw from the role at the end of 2010. Pirelli previously competed in Formula One from 1950–1958, 1981–1986 and 1989–1991. Pirelli also supplies tyres for the FIA Formula 2 Championship (formerly GP2 Series), FIA Formula 3 Championship (formerly GP3 Series) and F1 Academy, that form the feeder series to Formula One. Pirelli&#x27;s deal is due to end after the 2027 Formula One World Championship.

The Italian tyre manufacturer introduced a colour coding system to help identify the tyre compounds used by drivers during races. Each compound has its own colour, which appears on the sidewalls of the tyre. Since the 2019 season, Pirelli has used three colours to identify its dry-weather P Zero tyres: white for hard, yellow for medium, and red for soft. As well as the dry-weather slick tyres, there are two wet-weather grooved tyres: green for the intermediate and blue for the full wet. These tyres are branded Cinturato, a name that dates back to the 1950s. At the start of Pirelli&#x27;s Formula One tenure in 2011, the company was given the technically challenging task of designing tyres that degraded rapidly in order to promote more pit stops and overtaking, with the aim of making the races more exciting and entertaining. However, the brief from the sport&#x27;s organisers has changed over the years, as the cars themselves evolved with the introduction of the turbo hybrid era in 2014.

Pirelli has faced controversy on a number of occasions in Formula One, especially during the 2013 British Grand Prix, which featured multiple tyre failures. Pirelli subsequently changed the construction of the tyres to prevent further incidents, switching to Kevlar belts. At the 2015 Belgian Grand Prix, a tyre on Sebastian Vettel&#x27;s Ferrari suffered from a blowout at . Immediately after the race Pirelli claimed that excessive wear caused the blowout but following a more detailed analysis, the company said that in fact, a cut had caused the tyre failure. A number of major changes to the Formula One tyres were introduced for the 2017 season. The most obvious visual difference was an increase of width by 25%, both front and rear, increasing from 245-mm to 305-mm at the front and 325-mm to 405-mm at the rear. The actual rim size remained unchanged from the traditional 13 inches. The faster cornering speeds as a result of this change imposed significantly increased loads on the tyres. Pirelli was consequently asked to produce tyres with less degradation that were more resistant to overheating, for the fastest cars in Formula One history.

A far-reaching alteration to the Formula One technical regulations for 2022, covering every aspect of the car, prompted another significant change to the tyres. With an imminent move to 18-inch rims after more than 50 years of the 13-inch size, Pirelli&#x27;s 2022 tyres maintain the same tread width as before, but diameter has increased from 660 millimetres to 720 millimetres. The sidewall height is also reduced to give the tyres a more modern low-profile look.

===Superbike World Championship===

Pirelli is the only allowed tyre brand in the FIM Superbike World Championship since 2007 (along with its support classes, such as the Supersport World Championship). Pirelli has also been awarded the contract for the control tyre supply in the British Superbike Championship from 2008 until at least 2010.

===Grand Prix motorcycle racing===

Pirelli officially replaces Dunlop as the sole tire supplier for Moto3 and Moto2 starting in 2024. This was announced by Dorna Sports via the official MotoGP website. The Pirelli and Dorna contract has a duration of three seasons.

=== Speedboats ===
Pirelli has partnered with Italian Boat Manufacture Sacs Tecnorib Spa to create the Pirelli Rigid inflatable Boat. They have models ranging from 30 to 50 feet, including small tenders (X and J Models).

Their most recent and popular collaboration has been with German Luxury Car Tuner Mansory. The new collaboration has been showcased to the public at the 2024 Cannes Boat Show and 2024 Genoa Boat Show.

==Overseas investment==
In April 2012, Pirelli &amp; C. SpA signed a joint venture agreement with Indonesian counterpart PT Astra Autoparts a subsidiary of PT Astra International for the construction of a motorcycle tyre plant with a total investment of $120 million. 60 per cent of shares will be held by Pirelli. Pirelli hoped to strengthen its presence in the largest motorcycle market in the world, Southeast Asia which has 250 million motorcycles.

==Audio system==
In July 2018, Pirelli launched a Formula One wheel-shaped Bluetooth speaker, P Zero Sound. The Bluetooth speaker measures in diameter, weighs and has a 100-watt amplifier, a mid-woofer, a tweeter and also offers Bluetooth 4.0 with AptX for wireless connectivity. IXOOST is the manufacturer of P Zero Sound speaker, which majorly manufactures Motorsports-themed audio systems. The wheel-shaped speaker costs €2400, which is equivalent to about $2,800.

<doc id="49668" wikidata="Q777089" url="?curid=49668" title="Aurora (aircraft)">
<text>Aurora is a rumored mid-1980s American reconnaissance aircraft. There is no substantial evidence that it was ever built or flown and it has been termed a myth.

The U.S. government has consistently denied such an aircraft was ever built. Aviation and space reference site &quot;Aerospaceweb.org&quot; concluded, &quot;The evidence supporting the Aurora is circumstantial or pure conjecture, there is little reason to contradict the government&#x27;s position.&quot;

Former Skunk Works director Ben Rich confirmed that &quot;Aurora&quot; was simply a myth in &quot;Skunk Works&quot; (1994), a book detailing his days as the director. Rich wrote that a colonel working in the Pentagon arbitrarily assigned the name &quot;Aurora&quot; to the funding for the B-2 bomber design competition and somehow the name was leaked to the media.

In 2006, veteran black project watcher and aviation writer Bill Sweetman said, &quot;Does Aurora exist? Years of pursuit have led me to believe that, yes, Aurora is most likely in active development, spurred on by recent advances that have allowed technology to catch up with the ambition that launched the program a generation ago.&quot;

==Background==
The Aurora legend started in 1985, when the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and later &quot;Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology&quot; magazine broke the news that the term &quot;Aurora&quot; had been inadvertently included in the 1985 U.S. budget, as an allocation of $455 million for &quot;black aircraft production&quot; in FY 1987. According to &quot;Aviation Week&quot;, &quot;Project Aurora&quot; referred to a group of exotic aircraft, and not to one particular airframe. Funding of the project allegedly reached $2.3 billion in fiscal 1987, according to a 1986 procurement document obtained by &quot;Aviation Week&quot;. In the 1994 book &quot;Skunk Works&quot;, Ben Rich, the former head of Lockheed&#x27;s Skunk Works division, wrote that the Aurora was the budgetary code name for the stealth bomber fly-off that resulted in the B-2 Spirit.

==Evidence==
By the late 1980s, many aerospace industry observers believed that the U.S. had the technological capability to build a Mach 5 (hypersonic speed) replacement for the aging Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. Detailed examinations of the U.S. defense budget claimed to have found money missing or channeled into black projects. By the mid-1990s, reports surfaced of sightings of unidentified aircraft flying over California and the United Kingdom involving odd-shaped contrails, sonic booms, and related phenomena that suggested the US had developed such an aircraft. Nothing ever linked any of these observations to any program or aircraft type, but the name Aurora was often tagged on these as a way of explaining the observations.

===British sighting claims===
In late August 1989, while working as an engineer on the jack-up barge &quot;GSF Galveston Key&quot; in the North Sea, Chris Gibson saw an unfamiliar isosceles triangle-shaped delta aircraft, apparently refueling from a Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker and accompanied by a pair of F-111 fighter-bombers. Gibson watched the aircraft for several minutes, until they went out of sight. He subsequently drew a sketch of the formation.

When the sighting was made public in 1992, the British Defence Secretary Tom King was told, &quot;There is no knowledge in the MoD of a &#x27;black&#x27; programme of this nature, although it would not surprise the relevant desk officers in the Air Staff and Defence Intelligence Staff if it did exist.&quot;

Group Captain Tom Eeles, RAF, writes of a mystery aircraft flying over his house, near to the Mildenhall USAF base in Suffolk, at about 2:00am on a Sunday morning in the autumn of 1993. He had been awoken by &quot;a very strange-sounding aircraft passing overhead; the engine noise was a pulsing sound quite unlike anything I&#x27;d heard before.&quot; He saw lights disappearing towards Mildenhall. Enquiries were made of a senior RAF officer at Mildenhall the following morning, at which point he was told firmly &quot;to stop making inquiries at once&quot;. Group Captain Eeles attributes this sighting to a new stealth aircraft called Aurora. A few weeks earlier, there had been &quot;an unexplained incident at Boscombe Down apparently involving an emergency landing by an unknown US aircraft, after which it was covered in tarpaulins and removed with great secrecy by an American C5 transport aircraft.&quot;

A crash at RAF Boscombe Down in Wiltshire on 26 September 1994 appeared closely linked to &quot;black&quot; missions, according to a report in &quot;AirForces Monthly&quot;. Further investigation was hampered by USAF aircraft flooding into the base. Special Air Service personnel arrived in plainclothes in an Agusta 109. The crash site was protected from view by fire engines and tarpaulins and the base was closed to all flights soon afterwards. More recent analysis, however, indicates that the Boscombe Down crash was a towed missile decoy.

An unsubstantiated claim on the Horsted Keynes Village Web Site purports to show photos of the trail left after an unusual sonic boom was heard over the village in July 2002. In 2005 the information was used in a BBC report about the Aurora project.

===U.S. sighting claims===
A series of unusual sonic booms was detected in Southern California beginning in mid-to-late 1991 and recorded by United States Geological Survey sensors across Southern California used to pinpoint earthquake epicenters. The sonic booms were characteristic of a smaller vehicle, rather than of the 37-meter long Space Shuttle orbiter. Furthermore, neither the Shuttle nor NASA&#x27;s single SR-71B was operating on the days the booms had been registered. In the article, &quot;In Plane Sight?&quot; which appeared in the &quot;Washington City Paper&quot; on 3 July 1992 (pp. 12–13), one of the seismologists, Jim Mori, noted: &quot;We can&#x27;t tell anything about the vehicle. They seem stronger than other sonic booms that we record once in a while. They&#x27;ve all come on Thursday mornings about the same time, between 4 and 7.&quot; Former NASA sonic boom expert Dom Maglieri studied the 15-year-old sonic boom data from the California Institute of Technology and has deemed that the data showed &quot;something at 90,000 ft (c. 27 km), Mach 4 to Mach 5.2&quot;. He also said the booms did not look like those from aircraft that had traveled through the atmosphere many miles away at Los Angeles International Airport; rather, they appeared to be booms from a high-altitude aircraft directly above the ground, moving at high speeds. The boom signatures of the two different aircraft patterns are wildly different. There was nothing particular to tie these events to any aircraft, but they served to increase the number of stories about the Aurora.

On 23 March 1992, near Amarillo, Texas, Steven Douglass photographed the &quot;donuts on a rope&quot; contrail and linked this sighting to distinctive sounds. He described the engine noise as: &quot;strange, loud pulsating roar... unique... a deep pulsating rumble that vibrated the house and made the windows shake... similar to rocket engine noise, but deeper, with evenly timed pulses.&quot; In addition to providing the first photographs of the distinctive contrail previously reported by many, the significance of this sighting was enhanced by Douglass&#x27; reports of intercepts of radio transmissions: &quot;Air-to-air communications... were between an AWACS aircraft with the call sign &quot;Dragnet 51&quot; from Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, and two unknown aircraft using the call signs &quot;Darkstar November&quot; and &quot;Darkstar Mike&quot;. Messages consisted of phonetically transmitted alphanumerics. It is not known whether this radio traffic had any association with the &quot;pulser&quot; that had just flown over Amarillo.&quot; (&quot;Darkstar&quot; is also a call sign of AWACS aircraft from a different squadron at Tinker AFB) A month later, radio enthusiasts in California monitoring Edwards AFB Radar (callsign &quot;Joshua Control&quot;) heard early morning radio transmissions between Joshua and a high flying aircraft using the callsign &quot;Gaspipe&quot;. &quot;You&#x27;re at 67,000 feet, 81 miles out&quot; was heard, followed by &quot;70 miles out now, 36,000 ft, above glideslope.&quot; As in the past, nothing linked these observations to any particular aircraft or program, but the attribution to the Aurora helped expand the legend.

In February 1994, a former resident of Rachel, Nevada, and Area 51 enthusiast, Chuck Clark, claimed to have filmed the Aurora taking off from the Groom Lake facility. In the David Darlington book &quot;Area 51: The Dreamland Chronicles&quot;, he said:

I even saw the Aurora take off one or an aircraft that matched the Aurora&#x27;s reputed configuration: a sharp delta with twin tails about a hundred and thirty feet long. It taxied out of a lighted hangar at 2:30a.m. and used a lot of runway to take off. It had one red light on top, but the minute the wheels left the runway, the light went off and that was the last I saw of it. I didn&#x27;t hear it because the wind was blowing from behind me toward the base.&quot; I asked when this had taken place. &quot;February 1994. Obviously they didn&#x27;t think anybody was out there. It was thirty below zero – probably ninety below with the wind chill factor. I had hiked into White Sides from a different, harder way than usual, and stayed there two or three days among the rocks, under a camouflage tarp with six layers of clothes on. I had an insulated face mask and two sleeping bags, so I didn&#x27;t present a heat signature. I videotaped the aircraft through a telescope with a five-hundred-millimeter f4 lens coupled via a C-ring to a high-eight digital video camera with five hundred and twenty scan lines of resolution, which is better than TV.&quot; The author then asked, &quot;Where&#x27;s the tape?&quot; &quot;Locked away. That&#x27;s a legitimate spyplane; my purpose is not to give away legitimate national defense. When they get ready to unveil it, I&#x27;ll probably release the tape.&quot;

===Additional claims===
By 1996, reports associated with the Aurora name dropped off in frequency, suggesting to people who believed that the aircraft existed that it had only ever been a prototype or that it had had a short service life.

In 2000, &quot;Aberdeen Press and Journal&quot; writer Nic Outterside wrote a piece on US stealth technology in Scotland. Citing confidential &quot;sources&quot;, he alleged RAF/USAF Machrihanish in Kintyre, Argyll to be a base for Aurora aircraft. Machrihanish&#x27;s almost long runway makes it suitable for high-altitude and experimental aircraft with the fenced-off coastal approach making it ideal for takeoffs and landings to be made well away from eyes or cameras of press and public. &quot;Oceanic Air Traffic Control at Prestwick,&quot; Outterside says, &quot;also tracked fast-moving radar blips. It was claimed by staff that a &#x27;hypersonic jet was the only rational conclusion&#x27; for the readings.&quot;

In 2006, aviation writer Bill Sweetman put together 20 years of examining budget &quot;holes&quot;, unexplained sonic booms, as well as the Gibson sighting and concluded:

In June 2017, &quot;Aviation Week&quot; reported that Rob Weiss, the General Manager of the Skunk Works, provided some confirmation of a research project and stated that hypersonic flight technology was now mature, and efforts were underway to fly an aircraft with it.

<text>Groom Lake is a dry lake, also described as a salt flat, in Nevada. It is used for runways of the Nellis Bombing Range Test Site airport (KXTA). Part of the Area 51 USAF installation, it lies at an elevation of and is approximately from north to south and from east to west at its widest point, and is approximately 11.3 miles in circumference. Located within the namesake Groom Lake Valley portion of the Tonopah Basin, the lake is south of Rachel, Nevada.

The nearest publicly accessible vantage point is Tikaboo Peak, 26 miles to the east. There were two closer vantage points, dubbed &quot;Freedom Ridge&quot; and &quot;White Sides&quot;, but they were closed to public access in 1995 to prevent people from taking pictures of the installation.

==History==
Lead and silver were discovered in the southern part of the Groom Range in 1864, and the English Groome Lead Mines Limited company financed the Conception Mines in the 1870s, giving the district its name (nearby mines included Maria, Willow and White Lake). The mining claims in Groom were acquired by J. B. Osborne and partners and patented in 1876, and Osborne&#x27;s son acquired the interests in the 1890s. The claims were proved in 1916 when two companies began working their mines; that work continued until 1918, and resuming after World War II until the early 1950s.

<doc id="49673" wikidata="Q356173" url="?curid=49673" title="George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence">
<text>George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence (21 October 144918 February 1478), was the sixth child and third surviving son of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, and Cecily Neville, and the brother of English kings Edward IV and Richard III. He played an important role in the dynastic struggle between rival factions of the Plantagenets now known as the Wars of the Roses.

Though a member of the House of York, he switched sides to support the House of Lancaster, before reverting to the Yorkists. He was later convicted of treason against his elder brother, Edward IV, and executed, allegedly by drowning in malmsey wine. He appears as a character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;, in which his death is attributed to the machinations of Richard.

==Life==

George was born on 21 October 1449 in Dublin at a time when his father, the Duke of York, had begun to challenge Henry VI for the crown. His godfather was James FitzGerald, 6th Earl of Desmond. He was the second of the three sons of Richard and Cecily who survived their father and became a potential claimant for the crown. His father died in 1460. In 1461 his elder brother, Edward, became King of England as Edward IV and George was made Duke of Clarence. Despite his youth, he was appointed as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in the same year.
Having been mentioned as a possible husband for Mary, daughter of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, Clarence came under the influence of his first cousin Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, and in July 1469 was married in Église Notre-Dame de Calais to the earl&#x27;s elder daughter Isabel Neville.

Clarence had actively supported his elder brother&#x27;s claim to the throne, but when his father-in-law (known as &quot;the Kingmaker&quot;) deserted Edward IV to ally with Margaret of Anjou, consort of the deposed King Henry, Clarence supported him and was deprived of his office as Lord Lieutenant. Clarence joined Warwick in France, taking his pregnant wife. She gave birth to their first child, a girl, on 16 April 1470, in a ship off Calais. The child died shortly afterwards. Henry VI rewarded Clarence by making him next in line to the throne after his own son, justifying the exclusion of Edward IV both by attainder for his treason against the House of Lancaster as well as his alleged illegitimacy. After a short time, Clarence realized that his loyalty to his father-in-law was misplaced: Warwick had his younger daughter, Anne Neville, Clarence&#x27;s sister-in-law, marry Henry VI&#x27;s son in December 1470. This demonstrated that his father-in-law was less interested in making him king than in serving his own interests and, since it now seemed unlikely that Warwick would replace Edward IV with Clarence, Clarence was secretly reconciled with Edward.

Warwick&#x27;s efforts to keep Henry VI on the throne ultimately failed and Warwick was killed at the battle of Barnet in April 1471. The re-instated King Edward IV restored his brother Clarence to royal favour by making him Great Chamberlain of England. As his father-in-law had died, Clarence became &quot;jure uxoris&quot; Earl of Warwick, but did not inherit the entire Warwick estate as his younger brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, had married () Anne Neville, who had been widowed in 1471. Edward intervened and eventually divided the estates between his brothers. Clarence was created, by right of his wife, first Earl of Warwick on 25 March 1472, and first Earl of Salisbury in a new creation.

In 1475 Clarence&#x27;s wife Isabel gave birth to a son, Edward, later Earl of Warwick. Isabel died on 22 December 1476, two months after giving birth to a short-lived son named Richard (5 October 14761 January 1477). George and Isabel are buried together at Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire. Their surviving children, Margaret and Edward, were cared for by their aunt, Anne Neville, until she died in 1485 when Edward was 10 years old.

==Death==
Though most historians now believe Isabel&#x27;s death was a result of either consumption or childbed fever, Clarence was convinced she had been poisoned by one of her ladies-in-waiting, Ankarette Twynyho, whom, as a consequence, he had judicially murdered in April 1477, by summarily arresting her and bullying a jury at Warwick into convicting her of murder by poisoning. She was hanged immediately after trial with John Thursby, a fellow defendant. She was posthumously pardoned in 1478 by King Edward. Clarence&#x27;s mental state, never stable, deteriorated from that point and led to his involvement in yet another rebellion against his brother Edward.

According to the bill of attainder passed against him, Clarence made a number of his servants swear personal loyalty to him and sent them into various parts of the kingdom to stir up rebellion against Edward, claiming that Edward intended to disinherit him and that he had used witchcraft to poison his subjects. It was also alleged that he had plotted to have a &quot;strange child&quot; pose as his son, while he intended to send his son into Ireland or Flanders to get assistance against Edward, but this plan was not successful. Clarence was also said to have secretly kept a document signed by Henry VI, specifying that Clarence was to become king in the event of his death.

In 1477 Clarence was again a suitor for the hand of Mary, who had just become duchess of Burgundy. Edward objected to the match, and Clarence left the court.

The arrest and committal to the Tower of London of one of Clarence&#x27;s retainers, an Oxford astronomer named John Stacy, led to his confession under torture that he had &quot;imagined and compassed&quot; the death of the king, and used the black arts to accomplish this. He implicated Thomas Burdet, and Thomas Blake, a chaplain at Stacey&#x27;s college (Merton College, Oxford).

All three were tried for treason, convicted, and condemned to be drawn to Tyburn and hanged. Blake was saved at the eleventh hour by a plea for his life from James Goldwell, Bishop of Norwich, but the other two were put to death as ordered.

This was a clear warning to Clarence, which he chose to ignore. He appointed John Goddard to burst into Parliament and regale the House with Burdett and Stacey&#x27;s declarations of innocence that they had made before their deaths. Goddard was a very unwise choice, as he was an ex-Lancastrian who had expounded Henry VI&#x27;s claim to the throne. Edward summoned Clarence to Windsor, severely upbraided him, accused him of treason, and ordered his immediate arrest and confinement.

Clarence was imprisoned in the Tower of London and put on trial for treason against his brother Edward IV. Clarence was not present – Edward himself prosecuted his brother, and demanded that Parliament pass a bill of attainder against his brother, declaring that he was guilty of &quot;unnatural, loathly treasons&quot; which were aggravated by the fact that Clarence was his brother, who, if anyone did, owed him loyalty and love. Following his conviction and attainder, he was &quot;privately executed&quot; at the Tower on 18 February 1478, by tradition in the Bowyer Tower, and soon after the event, a rumour spread that he had been drowned in a butt of malmsey wine.

A reason for Edward to have his brother executed may have been that George had &quot;threatened to question the legality of the royal marriage&quot; and he may have discovered from Bishop Robert Stillington of Bath and Wells that George &quot;had probably let slip the secret of the precontract&quot; for Edward&#x27;s marriage with Lady Eleanor Talbot, although others dispute this.

==In Shakespeare==

Clarence is a principal character in two of William Shakespeare&#x27;s history plays: &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot; and &quot;Richard III.&quot; Shakespeare portrays Clarence as weak-willed and changeable. His initial defection from Edward IV to Warwick is prompted by resentment at the favors bestowed by Edward to the family of his queen Elizabeth Woodville. Despite several speeches proclaiming loyalty to Warwick, and to Henry VI, Clarence defects back to Edward&#x27;s side when he sees his brothers again; it takes only a few lines for his brothers to shame him into rejoining the Yorkist party. Several lines reference his penchant for wine.

&quot;Richard III&quot; opens with Gloucester having framed Clarence for treason, using a soothsayer to sow doubt in the King&#x27;s mind about his brother, and in the first scene Clarence is arrested and taken to the Tower. Gloucester nimbly stage-manages Clarence&#x27;s death, fast-tracking the order of execution and intercepting the King&#x27;s pardon when Edward changes his mind. In Act One Scene Four, Clarence recounts a terrifying nightmare in which he has been pushed (accidentally) into the ocean by Gloucester and drowns, then finds himself in hell, accused of perjury by the ghosts of Warwick and Prince Edward. When he is attacked by assassins sent by Gloucester, he pleads eloquently and nobly but is stabbed and drowned in a butt of Malmsey wine. It is Clarence&#x27;s death that sends Edward into a fatal attack of remorse. Clarence is the first character to die in the play; his ghost later appears to Gloucester, then already Richard III, and Henry Tudor, the future Henry VII of England, before the Battle of Bosworth Field, cursing his brother and encouraging Henry.

==Children==
Clarence married Isabel Neville in Calais, at that time controlled by England, on 11 July 1469. Together they had four children:
* Anne of Clarence (16 April 1470c. 17 April 1470), who was born and died in a ship off Calais. Identified by some sources as a girl but by others as an unnamed boy.
* Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury (14 August 147328 May 1541); married Sir Richard Pole; executed by Henry VIII.
* Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick (25 February 147528 November 1499); executed by Henry VII on grounds of attempting to escape from the Tower of London.
* Richard of Clarence (5 October 14761 January 1477); born at Tewkesbury Abbey, Gloucestershire; died at Warwick Castle and buried in Warwick.

<text>Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, 6th Earl of Salisbury (22 November 1428 – 14 April 1471), known as Warwick the Kingmaker, was an English nobleman, administrator, landowner of the House of Neville fortune and military commander. The eldest son of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, he became Earl of Warwick through marriage, and was the wealthiest and most powerful English peer of his age, with political connections that went beyond the country&#x27;s borders. One of the leaders in the Wars of the Roses, originally on the Yorkist side but later switching to the Lancastrian side, he was instrumental in the deposition of two kings, which led to his epithet of &quot;Kingmaker&quot;.

Through fortunes of marriage and inheritance, Warwick emerged in the 1450s at the centre of English politics. Originally, he was a supporter of King Henry VI; however, a territorial dispute with Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, led him to collaborate with Richard, Duke of York, in opposing the king. From this conflict, he gained the strategically valuable post of Captain of Calais, a position that benefited him greatly in the years to come. The political conflict later turned into a full-scale rebellion, where in battle York was slain, as was Warwick&#x27;s father Salisbury. York&#x27;s son, however, later triumphed with Warwick&#x27;s assistance and was crowned King Edward IV. Edward initially ruled with Warwick&#x27;s support, but the two later fell out over foreign policy and the king&#x27;s choice to marry Elizabeth Woodville. After a failed plot to crown Edward&#x27;s brother, George, Duke of Clarence, Warwick instead restored Henry VI to the throne. The triumph was short-lived, however: on 14 April 1471, Warwick was defeated by Edward at the Battle of Barnet, and killed.

Warwick&#x27;s historical legacy has been a matter of much dispute. Historical opinion has alternated between seeing him as self-centred and rash and regarding him as a victim of the whims of an ungrateful king. It is generally agreed, however, that in his own time, he enjoyed great popularity in all layers of society, and that he was skilled at appealing to popular sentiments for political support.

==Background==

The Neville family, an ancient Durham family, came to prominence in England&#x27;s fourteenth-century wars against the Scots. In 1397, King Richard II granted Ralph Neville the title of Earl of Westmorland. Ralph&#x27;s son Richard, the later Earl of Warwick&#x27;s father, was a younger son by a second marriage, and not heir to the earldom. He received a favourable settlement, however, and became &quot;jure uxoris&quot; (&quot;by right of his wife&quot;) Earl of Salisbury through his marriage to Alice, daughter and heiress of Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury.

Salisbury&#x27;s son Richard, the later Earl of Warwick, was born on 22 November 1428; little is known of his childhood. At the age of eight, in 1436, Richard was married to Lady Anne Beauchamp, daughter of Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, and of his wife Isabel Despenser. This made him heir not only to the earldom of Salisbury, but also to a substantial part of the Montague, Beauchamp, and Despenser inheritance.

Circumstances would, however, increase his fortune even further. Beauchamp&#x27;s son Henry, who had married the younger Richard&#x27;s sister Cecily, died in 1446. When Henry&#x27;s daughter Anne died in 1449, Richard also found himself &quot;jure uxoris&quot; Earl of Warwick. Richard&#x27;s succession to the estates did not go undisputed, however. A protracted battle over parts of the inheritance ensued, particularly with Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, who had married a daughter from Richard Beauchamp&#x27;s first marriage. The dispute centred on land, not on the Warwick title, as Henry&#x27;s half-sisters were excluded from the succession.

By 1445 Richard had become a knight, probably at Margaret of Anjou&#x27;s coronation on 30 May that year; also around this time, his illegitimate daughter, Margaret (who married Richard Huddleston on 12 June 1464) was born.

He is visible in the historical record of the service of King Henry VI in 1449, which makes mention of his services in a grant. He performed military service in the north with his father and might have taken part in the war against Scotland in 1448–1449. When Richard, Duke of York, unsuccessfully rose up against the king in 1452, both Warwick and his father rallied to the side of King Henry VI.

==Civil war==
=== Discontent at court===
In June 1453, Somerset was granted custody of the lordship of Glamorgan—part of the Despenser heritage held by Warwick until then—and open conflict broke out between the two men. Then, in the summer of that year, King Henry fell ill. Somerset was a favourite of the king and Queen Margaret, and with the king incapacitated he was virtually in complete control of the government. This put Warwick at a disadvantage in his dispute with Somerset, and drove him into collaboration with York. The political climate, influenced by the military defeat in France, then started turning against Somerset. On 27 March 1454, a group of royal councillors appointed the Duke of York as protector of the realm. York could now count on the support not only of Warwick but also of Warwick&#x27;s father Salisbury, who had become more deeply involved in disputes with the House of Percy in the north of England.

York&#x27;s first protectorate did not last long. Early in 1455, the king rallied sufficiently to return to power, at least nominally, with Somerset again wielding real power. Warwick returned to his estates, as did York and Salisbury, and the three started raising troops. Marching towards London, they encountered the king at St Albans, where the two forces clashed. The battle was brief and not particularly bloody, but it was the first instance of armed hostilities between the forces of the Houses of York and Lancaster in the conflict known as the Wars of the Roses. It was also significant because it resulted in the capture of the king, and the death of Somerset.

=== Continuation of hostilities ===
York&#x27;s second protectorate that followed was even shorter-lived than the first. At the parliament of February 1456 the king—now under the influence of Queen Margaret—resumed personal government of the realm. By this time Warwick had taken over Salisbury&#x27;s role as York&#x27;s main ally, even appearing at that same parliament to protect York from retributions. This conflict was also a pivotal period in Warwick&#x27;s career, as it was resolved by his appointment as Constable of Calais. The post was to provide him with a vital power base in the following years of conflict. The continental town of Calais, conquered from France in 1347, was not only of vital strategic importance, it also held what was England&#x27;s largest standing army. There were some initial disputes, with the garrison and with the royal wool monopoly known as the staple, over payments in arrears, but in July Warwick finally took up his post.

After the recent events, Queen Margaret still considered Warwick a threat to the throne, and cut off his supplies. In August 1457, however, a French attack on the English seaport of Sandwich set off fears of a full-scale French invasion. Warwick was again funded to protect the garrison and patrol the English coast. In disregard of royal authority, he then conducted highly successful acts of piracy, against the Castilian fleet in May 1458, and against the Hanseatic fleet a few weeks later. He also used his time on the Continent to establish relations with Charles VII of France and Philip the Good of Burgundy. Developing a solid military reputation and with good international connections, he then brought a part of his garrison to England, where he met up with his father and York in the autumn of 1459.

===Yorkist Triumph===
In September 1459 Warwick crossed over to England and made his way north to Ludlow to meet up with York and Salisbury, the latter fresh from his victory over Lancastrians at the Battle of Blore Heath. At nearby Ludford Bridge their forces were scattered by the king&#x27;s army, partly because of the defection of Warwick&#x27;s Calais contingent under the command of Andrew Trollope. As it turned out, the majority of the soldiers were still reluctant to raise arms against the king. Forced to flee the country, York left for Dublin, Ireland, with his second son Edmund, Earl of Rutland, while Warwick and Salisbury sailed to Calais, accompanied by the Duke&#x27;s son, Edward, Earl of March (the future King Edward IV). Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, was appointed to replace Warwick as Captain of Calais, but the Yorkists managed to hold on to the garrison.

In March 1460 Warwick visited York in Ireland to plan the way ahead and returned to Calais. Then, on 26 June, he landed at Sandwich with Salisbury and March, and from here the three earls rode north to London. Salisbury was left to besiege the Tower of London, while Warwick took March with him in pursuit of the king. At Northampton, on 10 July, King Henry was taken captive, while Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham and others were killed in battle.

In September York arrived from Ireland, and at the parliament of October that year, the Duke walked up to the throne and put his hand on it. The act, signifying usurpation, left the assembly in shock. It is unclear whether Warwick had prior knowledge of York&#x27;s plans, though it is assumed that this had been agreed upon between the two in Ireland the previous March. It soon became clear, however, that this regime change was unacceptable to the lords in parliament, and a compromise was agreed. The Act of Accord of 25 October 1460 stated that while Henry VI was allowed to stay on the throne for the remainder of his life, his son Edward, Prince of Wales, was to be disinherited. Instead, York would succeed the king, and act as protector.

This solution was not ideal to either party, and further conflict was inevitable. On 30 December, at the Battle of Wakefield, York was killed, as were York&#x27;s second son Edmund, Earl of Rutland, and Warwick&#x27;s younger brother Thomas. Salisbury was executed a day later. Warwick marched north to confront the enemy, but was defeated and forced to flee at the Second Battle of St Albans. He then joined forces with Prince Edward of York, the new Yorkist claimant to the crown, who had just won an important victory at the Battle of Mortimer&#x27;s Cross.

While Queen Margaret was hesitating to make her next move, Warwick and Edward hastened to London. The citizens of the capital were scared by the brutal conduct of the Lancastrian forces, and were sympathetic to the House of York. On 4 March the prince was proclaimed King Edward IV by an assembly that gathered quickly. The new king now headed north to consolidate his title and met with the Lancastrian forces at Towton in Yorkshire. Warwick had suffered an injury to the leg the day before, in the Battle of Ferrybridge, and may have played only a minor part in the battle that followed. The unusually bloody battle resulted in a complete victory for the Yorkist forces, and the death of many important men on the opposing side, such as Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, and Andrew Trollope. Queen Margaret managed to escape to Scotland, with Henry and Prince Edward. Edward IV returned to London for his coronation, while Warwick remained to pacify the north.

== In Power ==
===Warwick&#x27;s apex===

Warwick&#x27;s position after the accession of Edward IV was stronger than ever. He had now succeeded to his father&#x27;s possessions—including his vast network of retainers—and in 1462 he also inherited his mother&#x27;s lands and the Salisbury title. Altogether, he had an annual income from his lands of over £7,000, far more than any other man in the realm but the king. Edward confirmed Warwick&#x27;s position as Captain of Calais, and made him High Admiral of England and Steward of the Duchy of Lancaster, along with several other offices. His brothers also benefited: John Neville, Lord Montagu, was made Warden of the East March in 1463, and the next year created Earl of Northumberland. George Neville, Bishop of Exeter, was confirmed in his post as chancellor by King Edward, and in 1465 promoted to the archbishopric of York.

By late 1461, risings in the north had been put down, and in the summer of 1462, Warwick negotiated a truce with Scotland. In October the same year, Margaret of Anjou invaded England with troops from France, and managed to take the castles of Alnwick and Bamburgh. Warwick had to organise the recapture of the castles, which was accomplished by January 1463. The leaders of the rebellion, including Ralph Percy, were pardoned and left in charge of the retaken castles. At this point, Warwick felt secure enough to travel south; in February he buried the remains of his father and brother at Bisham Priory, and in March he attended parliament at Westminster.

That same spring, however, the north rose up in rebellion once more, when Ralph Percy laid siege to Norham Castle. Warwick returned to the north and rescued Norham in July, but the Lancastrians were left in possession of Northumberland, and the government decided on a diplomatic approach instead. Separate truces were negotiated with Scotland and France by late 1463, which allowed Warwick to retake the Northumbrian castles held by the Lancastrian rebels in the spring of 1464. This time no clemency was given, and around thirty of the rebel leaders were executed.

===Early tensions===

At the negotiations with the French, Warwick had intimated that King Edward was interested in a marriage arrangement with the French crown, the intended bride being Louis XI&#x27;s sister-in-law, Bona, daughter of Louis, Duke of Savoy. This marriage was not to be, however, because in September 1464, Edward revealed that he was already married, to Elizabeth Woodville. The marriage caused great offence to Warwick: not only due to the fact that his plans had been sabotaged, but also the secrecy with which the king had acted. The marriage—contracted on 1 May of the same year—was not made public before Warwick pressed Edward on the issue at a council meeting, and in the meanwhile, Warwick had been unknowingly deceiving the French into believing the king was serious about the marriage proposal. For Edward the marriage may very well have been a love match, but in the long run, he sought to build the Woodville family into a powerhouse independent of Warwick&#x27;s influence. The marriage of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville caused Warwick to lose his power and influence. He accused Elizabeth, and her mother Jacquetta of Luxembourg, of witchcraft to try to restore the power that he had lost.

This was not enough to cause a complete fallout between the two men, though from this point on Warwick increasingly stayed away from court. The promotion of Warwick&#x27;s brother George to Archbishop of York shows that the earl was still in favour with the king. In July 1465, when Henry VI was once more captured, it was Warwick who escorted the fallen king to his captivity in the Tower.

Then, in the spring of 1466, Warwick was sent to the continent to carry out negotiations with the French and Burgundians. The negotiations centred around a marriage proposal involving Edward&#x27;s sister Margaret. Warwick increasingly came to favour French diplomatic connections. Meanwhile, Edward&#x27;s father-in-law, Richard Woodville, Earl Rivers, who had been created treasurer, was in favour of a Burgundian alliance. This set up an internal conflict within the English court, which was not alleviated by the fact that Edward had signed a secret treaty in October with Burgundy, while Warwick was forced to carry on sham negotiations with the French. Later, George Neville was dismissed as chancellor, while Edward refused to contemplate a marriage between Warwick&#x27;s oldest daughter Isabel, and Edward&#x27;s brother George, Duke of Clarence. It became increasingly clear that Warwick&#x27;s position of dominance at court had been taken over by Rivers.

In the autumn of 1467, there were rumours that Warwick was now sympathetic to the Lancastrian cause, but even though he refused to come to court to answer the charges, the king accepted his denial in writing. In July 1468, it was revealed that Warwick&#x27;s deputy in Calais, John, Lord Wenlock, was involved in a Lancastrian conspiracy, and early in 1469 another Lancastrian plot was uncovered, involving John de Vere, Earl of Oxford. It was becoming clear that the discontent with Edward&#x27;s reign was widespread, a fact that Warwick could exploit.

==Defection==
=== Rebellion ===
Warwick now orchestrated a rebellion in Yorkshire while he was away, led by a &quot;Robin of Redesdale&quot;. Part of Warwick&#x27;s plan was winning over King Edward&#x27;s younger brother, George Plantagenet, possibly with the prospect of installing him on the throne. The nineteen-year-old George had shown himself to share many of the abilities of his older brother but was also jealous and overambitious. 

In July 1469, the two sailed over to Calais, where George was married to Warwick&#x27;s daughter, Lady Isabel Neville. From there, they returned to England, where they gathered the men of Kent to join the rebellion in the north. Meanwhile, the king&#x27;s forces were defeated at the Battle of Edgecote, where William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, was killed. The other commander, Humphrey Stafford, Earl of Devon, was caught in flight and lynched by a mob. Later, Earl Rivers and his son, John Woodville, were also apprehended and murdered. With his army now defeated, King Edward IV was taken under arrest by George Neville. Warwick then imprisoned the king in Warwick Castle, and in August, the king was taken north to Middleham Castle. In the long run, however, it proved impossible to rule without the king, and continuing disorder forced Warwick to release King Edward IV in September 1469.

A &quot;modus vivendi&quot; had been achieved between Warwick and the king for some months, but the restoration of Henry Percy to Montagu&#x27;s earldom of Northumberland prevented any chance of full reconciliation. A trap was set for the king when disturbances in Lincolnshire led him north, where he could be confronted by Warwick&#x27;s men. Edward, however, discovered the plot when Robert, Lord Welles, was routed at Losecote Field in Rutland in March 1470, and gave away the plan.

Warwick soon gave up, and once more fled the country with Clarence. Denied access to Calais, they sought refuge with King Louis XI of France. Louis arranged a reconciliation between Warwick and Margaret of Anjou, and as part of the agreement, Margaret and Henry&#x27;s son, Edward, Prince of Wales, would marry Warwick&#x27;s daughter Anne. The objective of the alliance was to restore Henry VI to the throne. Again, Warwick staged an uprising in the north, and with the king away, he and Clarence landed at Dartmouth and Plymouth on 13 September 1470. 

Among the many who flocked to Warwick&#x27;s side was his brother Montagu, who had not taken part in the last rebellion, but was disappointed when his loyalty to the king had not been rewarded with the restoration of his earldom. This time the trap set up for the king worked; as Edward hurried south, Montagu&#x27;s forces approached from the north, and the king found himself surrounded. On 2 October he fled to Flanders, a part of the Duchy of Burgundy. King Henry was now restored, with Warwick acting as the true ruler in his capacity as lieutenant. At a parliament in November, Edward was attainted of his lands and titles, and Clarence was awarded the Duchy of York.

=== Death ===
At this point, international affairs intervened. Louis XI declared war on Burgundy, and Charles the Bold responded by granting an expeditionary force to Edward IV, in order to reclaim his throne. On 14 March 1471, Edward landed at Ravenspurn in Yorkshire, with the acquiescence of the Earl of Northumberland. Warwick was still waiting for Queen Margaret and her son Edward, who were supposed to bring reinforcements from France but were kept on the continent by bad weather. At this point, Edward received the support of his brother Clarence, who realised that he had been disadvantaged by the new agreement with the Lancastrians. Clarence&#x27;s defection weakened Warwick, who nevertheless went in pursuit of Edward. On 14 April 1471 the two armies met at Barnet. Fog and poor visibility on the field led to confusion, and the Lancastrian army ended up attacking its own men. In the face of defeat Warwick attempted to escape the field but was struck off his horse and killed.

==Aftermath==
Warwick&#x27;s body—along with that of his brother Montagu, who had also fallen at Barnet—was displayed in London&#x27;s St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral to quell any rumours of their survival. Then they were handed over to Archbishop Neville, to be buried in the family vault at Bisham Priory near the river Thames in Berkshire. No trace now remains of either the tomb or the church in which it was housed. On 4 May 1471, Edward IV defeated the remaining Lancastrian forces of Queen Margaret and Prince Edward at the Battle of Tewkesbury, where the prince was killed. Soon afterwards, it was reported that King Henry VI had also died in the Tower. With the direct Lancastrian line exterminated, Edward could reign safely until his death in 1483.

Warwick had no sons. His offices were divided between King Edward&#x27;s brothers George, Duke of Clarence (who had married Warwick&#x27;s daughter Isabel Neville), and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, the future Richard III (who would marry Warwick&#x27;s daughter Anne Neville). Clarence received the chamberlainship of England and the lieutenancy of Ireland, while Gloucester was made Admiral of England and Warden of the West March. Clarence also received the earldoms of Warwick and Salisbury. The earl&#x27;s land had been forfeited and taken into the king&#x27;s custody. When Gloucester married Warwick&#x27;s younger daughter Anne in 1472, who had been recently widowed by the death of Prince Edward, a dispute broke out between the two princes over the Beauchamp and Despenser inheritances. A compromise was eventually reached, whereby the land was divided, but Clarence was not pacified. In 1477 he once again plotted against his brother. This time the king could no longer act with lenience, and the next year the Duke of Clarence was executed.

===Assessment===
Early sources on Richard Neville fall into two categories. The first are the sympathetic chronicles of the early Yorkist years, or works based on these, such as the &quot;Mirror for Magistrates&quot; (1559). The other category originates with chronicles commissioned by Edward IV after Warwick&#x27;s fall, such as the &quot;Historie of the arrivall of Edward IV&quot;, and take a more negative view of the earl. The &quot;Mirror&quot; portrayed Warwick as a great man: beloved by the people, and betrayed by the man he helped raise to the throne. The other perspective can be found in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry VI&quot; trilogy: a man driven by pride and egotism, who created and deposed kings at will.

In time, however, it is the latter view that dominated. The Enlightenment, or Whig historians of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, decried anyone who impeded the development towards a centralised, constitutional monarchy, the way Warwick did in his struggles with Edward. David Hume called Warwick &quot;the greatest, as well as the last, of those mighty barons who formerly overawed the crown, and rendered the people incapable of any regular system of civil government.&quot; Later writers were split between admiration for some of Warwick&#x27;s character traits, and condemnation of his political actions. The romantic novelist Lord Lytton picked up on Hume&#x27;s theme in his &quot;The Last of the Barons&quot;. Though Lytton portrayed Warwick as a tragic hero who embodied the ideals of chivalry, he was nevertheless one whose time was past. The late-nineteenth-century military historian Charles Oman acknowledged the earl&#x27;s ability to appeal to popular sentiments, yet pointed out his deficiencies as a military commander. Oman found Warwick a traditional strategist, &quot;not attaining the heights of military genius displayed by his pupil Edward.&quot; Paul Murray Kendall&#x27;s popular biography from 1957 took a sympathetic view of Warwick but concluded that he had ultimately fallen victim to his own overreaching ambition.

More recent historians, such as Michael Hicks and A. J. Pollard, have tried to see Warwick in light of the standards of his own age, rather than holding him up to contemporary constitutional ideals. The insults Warwick suffered at the hands of King Edward—including Edward&#x27;s secret marriage, and the refusal of the French diplomatic channel—were significant. His claim to prominence in national affairs was not a product of illusions of grandeur; it was confirmed by the high standing he enjoyed among the princes on the continent. Furthermore, Warwick&#x27;s cause was not considered unjust by his contemporaries, which can be seen by the earl&#x27;s popularity exceeding that of the king at the time of his first rebellion in 1469. On the other hand, while Warwick could not easily suffer his treatment by the king, it was equally impossible for Edward to accept the earl&#x27;s presence on the political scene. As long as Warwick remained as powerful and influential as he was, Edward could not fully assert his royal authority, and eventual confrontation became inevitable.

However, the memories written in Burgundy had a negative view of him. For example, according to Philippe de Commynes and Olivier de la Marche, Georges Chastellain, who all mention Edward&#x27;s popularity and character, Warwick was sage and cunning, and much richer than Edward, but he was very hated. In addition, unlike his brother John Nevill and Edward, he was not brave. A Burgundy historian Jean de Wavrin criticized him more bitterly than other Burgundians.

==Coat of arms==
The Earl of Warwick&#x27;s coat of arms was unusually complex for the period, with seven different quarterings in an unusual order. The first grand quarter consists of the arms of his father-in-law, Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, who bore his arms quartering Despenser (the arms of his wife Isabel le Despenser) with an inescutcheon of De Clare, which Warwick showed in the fourth quarter. The second grand quarter showed the arms of Montagu (quartering Monthermer). The third grand quarter showed the arms of Neville differenced – rather honourably augmented – by a label &quot;compony argent and azure&quot; for Beaufort (House of Lancaster) to signify the royal descent from Warwick&#x27;s father Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, who was the eldest son and heir of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland and his wife, Lady Joan Beaufort, daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, third son of King Edward III and great-grandfather of the last Lancastrian King Henry VI.

<text>Canadian raising (also sometimes known as English diphthong raising) is an allophonic rule of phonology in many varieties of North American English that changes the pronunciation of diphthongs with open-vowel starting points. Most commonly, the shift affects or , or both, when they are pronounced before voiceless consonants (therefore, in words like &quot;price&quot; and &quot;clout&quot;, respectively, but not in &quot;prize&quot; and &quot;cloud&quot;). In North American English, and usually begin in an open vowel [~], but through raising they shift to , or . Canadian English often has raising in words with both (&quot;height, life, psych, type&quot;, etc.) and (&quot;clout, house, south, scout,&quot; etc.), while a number of American English varieties (such as Inland North, Western New England, and increasingly more General American accents) have this feature in but not . It is thought to have originated in Canada in the late 19th century.

In the U.S., &quot;aboot&quot; , an exaggerated version of the raised pronunciation of &quot;about&quot; , is a stereotype of Canadian English.

Although the symbol is defined as an open-mid back unrounded vowel in the International Phonetic Alphabet, or may signify any raised vowel that contrasts with unraised or , when the exact quality of the raised vowel is not important in the given context.

==Description==
===Phonetic environment===
In general, Canadian raising affects vowels before voiceless consonants like , , , and . Vowels before voiced consonants like , , , and are usually not raised. Furthermore, it usually only happens within word boundaries. It has also been described as being blocked when the diphthong has less than primary stress and is immediately followed by a stressed syllable, resulting in a lack of raising in words like &quot;psychology, citation&quot; and &quot;micrometer&quot;, but raising in &quot;Psyche, cite,&quot; and &quot;microphone&quot;. This can be further explained with syllable structure or feet.

However, several studies indicate that this rule is not completely accurate, and have attempted to formulate different rules.

A study of three speakers in Meaford, Ontario, showed that pronunciation of the diphthong fell on a continuum between raised and unraised. Raising is influenced by voicing of the following consonant, but it may also be influenced by the sound before the diphthong. Frequently the diphthong was raised when preceded by a coronal: in &quot;gigantic&quot;, &quot;dinosaur&quot;, and &quot;Siberia&quot;.

Raising before , as in &quot;wire&quot;, &quot;iris&quot;, and &quot;fire&quot;, has been documented in some American accents.

Raising can apply to compound words. Hence, the first vowel in &quot;high school&quot; as a term meaning &quot;a secondary school for students approximately 14–18 years old&quot; may be raised, whereas &quot;high school&quot; with the literal meaning of &quot;a school that is high (e.g. in elevation)&quot; is unaffected. (The two terms are also distinguished by the position of the stress accent, as shown.) The same is true of &quot;high chair&quot;.

However, frequently it does not. One study of speakers in Rochester, New York and Minnesota found a very inconsistent pattern of raising before voiceless consonants in certain prefixes; for example, the numerical prefix &quot;bi-&quot; was raised in &quot;bicycle&quot; but not &quot;bisexual&quot; or &quot;bifocals&quot;. Likewise, the vowel was consistently kept low when used in a prefix in words like &quot;dichotomy&quot; and &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;. This pattern may have to do with stress or familiarity of the word to the speaker; however, these relations are still inconsistent.

In most dialects of North American English, intervocalic and are pronounced as an alveolar flap when the following vowel is unstressed or word-initial, a phenomenon known as &quot;flapping&quot;. In accents with both flapping and Canadian raising, or before a flapped may still be raised, even though the flap is a voiced consonant. Hence, while in accents without raising, &quot;writer&quot; and &quot;rider&quot; are pronounced differently as a result of a slight difference in vowel length due to pre-fortis clipping, in accents with raising, the words may be distinguished by their vowels: &quot;writer&quot; , &quot;rider&quot; .

===Result===
The raised variant of typically becomes . In most of Canada, the raised vowel is further front than , and in traditional New York City English, is backed towards except before voiceless consonants, resulting in a distinction based more on frontness, but in Philadelphia it may be more back.

The raised variant of varies by dialect, with more common in Western Canada and a fronted variant commonly heard in Central Canada. In any case, the open vowel component of the diphthongs changes to a mid vowel (, , or ).

==Geographic distribution==
===Inside Canada===
As its name implies, Canadian raising is found throughout most of Canada, though the exact phonetic quality of Canadian raising may differ throughout the country. In raised , the first element tends to be farther back in Quebec and the Canadian Prairies and Maritimes (particularly in Alberta): thus, . The first element tends to be the farthest forward in eastern and southern Ontario: thus, . Newfoundland English is the Canadian dialect that participates least in any conditioned Canadian raising, while Vancouver English may lack the raising of in particular.

===Outside Canada===
Canadian raising is not restricted to Canada. Raising of both and is common in eastern New England, for example in some Boston accents (the former more likely than the latter), as well as in the Upper Midwest. South Atlantic English, New Orleans English, and the accents of England&#x27;s Fens feature it as well. Raisinɡ of /aɪ/ before voiceless consonants is found in Wisbech, March, and Chatteris in the Central Fens, King&#x27;s Lynn, Downham Market
and Ely in the Eastern Fens, but not in the Western Fens.

Raising of just is found in a much greater number of dialects in the United States; some researchers have begun to refer to raising of without raising of as American Raising. This phenomenon is most consistently found in the Inland North, the Upper Midwest, New England, New York City, and the mid-Atlantic areas of Pennsylvania (including Philadelphia), Maryland, and Delaware, as well as in Virginia. It is somewhat less common in the lower Midwest, the West, and the South. However, there is considerable variation in the raising of , and it can be found inconsistently throughout the United States.

==Raising in other environments==
Raising of before certain voiced consonants is most prominent in the Inland North, Western New England, and Philadelphia. It has been noted to occur before , and especially. Hence, words like &quot;tiny&quot;, &quot;spider&quot;, &quot;cider&quot;, &quot;tiger&quot;, &quot;dinosaur&quot;, &quot;cyber-&quot;, &quot;beside&quot;, &quot;idle&quot; (but sometimes not &quot;idol&quot;), and &quot;fire&quot; may contain a raised nucleus. (Also note that in six of those nine words, is preceded by a coronal consonant; see above paragraph. In five [or possibly six] of those nine words, the syllable after the syllable with contains a liquid.) The use of rather than in such words is unpredictable from phonetic environment alone, though it may have to do with their acoustic similarity to other words that &quot;do&quot; contain before a voiceless consonant, per the traditional Canadian-raising system. Hence, some researchers have argued that there has been a phonemic split in these dialects; the distribution of the two sounds is becoming more unpredictable among younger speakers.

The raising of is also present in Ulster English, spoken in the northern region of the island of Ireland, in which is split between the sound (before voiced consonants or in final position) and the sound (before voiceless consonants but also sometimes in any position); phonologist Raymond Hickey has described this Ulster raising as &quot;embryonically the situation&quot; for Canadian raising.

<text>In information science, an ontology encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definitions of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, or entities that pertain to one, many, or all domains of discourse. More simply, an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, by defining a set of terms and relational expressions that represent the entities in that subject area. The field which studies ontologies so conceived is sometimes referred to as &quot;applied ontology&quot;.

Every academic discipline or field, in creating its terminology, thereby lays the groundwork for an ontology. Each uses ontological assumptions to frame explicit theories, research and applications. Improved ontologies may improve problem solving within that domain, interoperability of data systems, and discoverability of data. Translating research papers within every field is a problem made easier when experts from different countries maintain a controlled vocabulary of jargon between each of their languages. For instance, the definition and ontology of economics is a primary concern in Marxist economics, but also in other subfields of economics. An example of economics relying on information science occurs in cases where a simulation or model is intended to enable economic decisions, such as determining what capital assets are at risk and by how much (see risk management).

What ontologies in both information science and philosophy have in common is the attempt to represent entities, including both objects and events, with all their interdependent properties and relations, according to a system of categories. In both fields, there is considerable work on problems of ontology engineering (e.g., Quine and Kripke in philosophy, Sowa and Guarino in information science), and debates concerning to what extent normative ontology is possible (e.g., foundationalism and coherentism in philosophy, BFO and Cyc in artificial intelligence).

Applied ontology is considered by some as a successor to prior work in philosophy. However many current efforts are more concerned with establishing controlled vocabularies of narrow domains than with philosophical first principles, or with questions such as the mode of existence of fixed essences or whether enduring objects (e.g., perdurantism and endurantism) may be ontologically more primary than processes. Artificial intelligence has retained considerable attention regarding applied ontology in subfields like natural language processing within machine translation and knowledge representation, but ontology editors are being used often in a range of fields, including biomedical informatics, industry. Such efforts often use ontology editing tools such as Protégé.

==Ontology in Philosophy==

Ontology is a branch of philosophy and intersects areas such as metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of language, as it considers how knowledge, language, and perception relate to the nature of reality. Metaphysics deals with questions like &quot;what exists?&quot; and &quot;what is the nature of reality?&quot;. One of five traditional branches of philosophy, metaphysics is concerned with exploring existence through properties, entities and relations such as those between particulars and universals, intrinsic and extrinsic properties, or essence and existence. Metaphysics has been an ongoing topic of discussion since recorded history.

== Etymology ==

The compound word &quot;ontology&quot; combines &quot;-&quot;, from the Greek , &quot;on&quot; (gen. ὄντος, &quot;ontos&quot;), i.e. &quot;being; that which is&quot;, which is the present participle of the verb , &quot;eimí&quot;, i.e. &quot;to be, I am&quot;, and , &quot;&quot;, i.e. &quot;logical discourse&quot;, see classical compounds for this type of word formation.

While the etymology is Greek, the oldest extant record of the word itself, the Neo-Latin form &quot;ontologia&quot;, appeared in 1606 in the work &quot;Ogdoas Scholastica&quot; by Jacob Lorhard (&quot;Lorhardus&quot;) and in 1613 in the &quot;Lexicon philosophicum&quot; by Rudolf Göckel (&quot;Goclenius&quot;).

The first occurrence in English of &quot;ontology&quot; as recorded by the &quot;OED&quot; (&quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, online edition, 2008) came in &quot;Archeologia Philosophica Nova&quot; or &quot;New Principles of Philosophy&quot; by Gideon Harvey.

==Formal Ontology==

Since the mid-1970s, researchers in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have recognized that knowledge engineering is the key to building large and powerful AI systems. AI researchers argued that they could create new ontologies as computational models that enable certain kinds of automated reasoning, which was only marginally successful. In the 1980s, the AI community began to use the term &quot;ontology&quot; to refer to both a theory of a modeled world and a component of knowledge-based systems. In particular, David Powers introduced the word &quot;ontology&quot; to AI to refer to real world or robotic grounding, publishing in 1990 literature reviews emphasizing grounded ontology in association with the call for papers for a AAAI Summer Symposium Machine Learning of Natural Language and Ontology, with an expanded version published in SIGART Bulletin and included as a preface to the proceedings. Some researchers, drawing inspiration from philosophical ontologies, viewed computational ontology as a kind of applied philosophy.

In 1993, the widely cited web page and paper &quot;Toward Principles for the Design of Ontologies Used for Knowledge Sharing&quot; by Tom Gruber used &quot;ontology&quot; as a technical term in computer science closely related to earlier idea of semantic networks and taxonomies. Gruber introduced the term as &quot;a specification of a conceptualization&quot;: An ontology is a description (like a formal specification of a program) of the concepts and relationships that can formally exist for an agent or a community of agents. This definition is consistent with the usage of ontology as set of concept definitions, but more general. And it is a different sense of the word than its use in philosophy.

Attempting to distance ontologies from taxonomies and similar efforts in knowledge modeling that rely on classes and inheritance, Gruber stated (1993): Ontologies are often equated with taxonomic hierarchies of classes, class definitions, and the subsumption relation, but ontologies need not be limited to these forms. Ontologies are also not limited to &quot;conservative definitions&quot;, that is, definitions in the traditional logic sense that only introduce terminology and do not add any knowledge about the world (Enderton, 1972). To specify a conceptualization, one needs to state axioms that &quot;do&quot; constrain the possible interpretations for the defined terms.

As refinement of Gruber&#x27;s definition Feilmayr and Wöß (2016) stated: &quot;An ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization that is characterized by high semantic expressiveness required for increased complexity.&quot;

== Formal Ontology Components ==

Contemporary ontologies share many structural similarities, regardless of the language in which they are expressed. Most ontologies describe individuals (instances), classes (concepts), attributes and relations.

=== Types ===
==== Domain ontology ====
A domain ontology (or domain-specific ontology) represents concepts which belong to a realm of the world, such as biology or politics. Each domain ontology typically models domain-specific definitions of terms. For example, the word &quot;card&quot; has many different meanings. An ontology about the domain of poker would model the &quot;playing card&quot; meaning of the word, while an ontology about the domain of computer hardware would model the &quot;punched card&quot; and &quot;video card&quot; meanings.

Since domain ontologies are written by different people, they represent concepts in very specific and unique ways, and are often incompatible within the same project. As systems that rely on domain ontologies expand, they often need to merge domain ontologies by hand-tuning each entity or using a combination of software merging and hand-tuning. This presents a challenge to the ontology designer. Different ontologies in the same domain arise due to different languages, different intended usage of the ontologies, and different perceptions of the domain (based on cultural background, education, ideology, etc.).

At present, merging ontologies that are not developed from a common upper ontology is a largely manual process and therefore time-consuming and expensive. Domain ontologies that use the same upper ontology to provide a set of basic elements with which to specify the meanings of the domain ontology entities can be merged with less effort. There are studies on generalized techniques for merging ontologies, but this area of research is still ongoing, and it is a recent event to see the issue sidestepped by having multiple domain ontologies using the same upper ontology like the OBO Foundry.

=== Upper ontology ===

An upper ontology (or foundation ontology) is a model of the commonly shared relations and objects that are generally applicable across a wide range of domain ontologies. It usually employs a core glossary that overarches the terms and associated object descriptions as they are used in various relevant domain ontologies.

Standardized upper ontologies available for use include BFO, BORO method, Dublin Core, GFO, Cyc, SUMO, UMBEL, and DOLCE. WordNet has been considered an upper ontology by some and has been used as a linguistic tool for learning domain ontologies.

=== Hybrid ontology ===
The Gellish ontology is an example of a combination of an upper and a domain ontology.

== Visualization ==

A survey of ontology visualization methods is presented by Katifori et al. An updated survey of ontology visualization methods and tools was published by Dudás et al. The most established ontology visualization methods, namely indented tree and graph visualization are evaluated by Fu et al. A visual language for ontologies represented in OWL is specified by the &quot;Visual Notation for OWL Ontologies (VOWL)&quot;.

== Engineering ==

Ontology engineering (also called ontology building) is a set of tasks related to the development of ontologies for a particular domain. It is a subfield of knowledge engineering that studies the ontology development process, the ontology life cycle, the methods and methodologies for building ontologies, and the tools and languages that support them.

Ontology engineering aims to make explicit the knowledge contained in software applications, and organizational procedures for a particular domain. Ontology engineering offers a direction for overcoming semantic obstacles, such as those related to the definitions of business terms and software classes. Known challenges with ontology engineering include:
# Ensuring the ontology is &quot;current&quot; with domain knowledge and term use
# Providing &quot;sufficient specificity and concept coverage&quot; for the domain of interest, thus minimizing the content completeness problem
# Ensuring the ontology can support its use cases

=== Editors ===
Ontology editors are applications designed to assist in the creation or manipulation of ontologies. It is common for ontology editors to use one or more ontology languages.

Aspects of ontology editors include: visual navigation possibilities within the knowledge model, inference engines and information extraction; support for modules; the import and export of foreign knowledge representation languages for ontology matching; and the support of meta-ontologies such as OWL-S, Dublin Core, etc.

=== Learning ===

Ontology learning is the automatic or semi-automatic creation of ontologies, including extracting a domain&#x27;s terms from natural language text. As building ontologies manually is extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming, there is great motivation to automate the process. Information extraction and text mining have been explored to automatically link ontologies to documents, for example in the context of the BioCreative challenges.

=== Research ===
Epistemological assumptions, which in research asks &quot;What do you know? or &quot;How do you know it?&quot;, creates the foundation researchers use when approaching a certain topic or area for potential research. As epistemology is directly linked to knowledge and how we come about accepting certain truths, individuals conducting academic research must understand what allows them to begin theory building. Simply, epistemological assumptions force researchers to question how they arrive at the knowledge they have.

== Languages ==

An ontology language is a formal language used to encode an ontology. There are a number of such languages for ontologies, both proprietary and standards-based:
* Common Algebraic Specification Language is a general logic-based specification language developed within the IFIP working group 1.3 &quot;Foundations of System Specifications&quot; and is a &quot;de facto&quot; standard language for software specifications. It is now being applied to ontology specifications in order to provide modularity and structuring mechanisms.
* Common logic is ISO standard 24707, a specification of a family of ontology languages that can be accurately translated into each other.
* The Cyc project has its own ontology language called CycL, based on first-order predicate calculus with some higher-order extensions.
* DOGMA (Developing Ontology-Grounded Methods and Applications) adopts the fact-oriented modeling approach to provide a higher level of semantic stability.
* The Gellish language includes rules for its own extension and thus integrates an ontology with an ontology language.
* IDEF5 is a software engineering method to develop and maintain usable, accurate, domain ontologies.
* KIF is a syntax for first-order logic that is based on S-expressions. SUO-KIF is a derivative version supporting the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology.
* MOF and UML are standards of the OMG
* Olog is a category theoretic approach to ontologies, emphasizing translations between ontologies using functors. 
* OBO, a language used for biological and biomedical ontologies.
* OntoUML is an ontologically well-founded profile of UML for conceptual modeling of domain ontologies.
* OWL is a language for making ontological statements, developed as a follow-on from RDF and RDFS, as well as earlier ontology language projects including OIL, DAML, and DAML+OIL. OWL is intended to be used over the World Wide Web, and all its elements (classes, properties and individuals) are defined as RDF resources, and identified by URIs.
* Rule Interchange Format (RIF) and F-Logic combine ontologies and rules.
* Semantic Application Design Language (SADL) captures a subset of the expressiveness of OWL, using an English-like language entered via an Eclipse Plug-in.
* SBVR (Semantics of Business Vocabularies and Rules) is an OMG standard adopted in industry to build ontologies.
* TOVE Project, TOronto Virtual Enterprise project

== Libraries ==
The development of ontologies has led to the emergence of services providing lists or directories of ontologies called ontology libraries.

The following are libraries of human-selected ontologies.
* COLORE is an open repository of first-order ontologies in Common Logic with formal links between ontologies in the repository.
* DAML Ontology Library maintains a legacy of ontologies in DAML.
* Ontology Design Patterns portal is a wiki repository of reusable components and practices for ontology design, and also maintains a list of &quot;exemplary ontologies&quot;. 
* Protégé Ontology Library contains a set of OWL, Frame-based and other format ontologies.
* SchemaWeb is a directory of RDF schemata expressed in RDFS, OWL and DAML+OIL.

The following are both directories and search engines.
* OBO Foundry is a suite of interoperable reference ontologies in biology and biomedicine.
* Bioportal (ontology repository of NCBO)
* Linked Open Vocabularies
* OntoSelect Ontology Library offers similar services for RDF/S, DAML and OWL ontologies.
* Ontaria is a &quot;searchable and browsable directory of semantic web data&quot; with a focus on RDF vocabularies with OWL ontologies. (NB Project &quot;on hold&quot; since 2004).
* Swoogle is a directory and search engine for all RDF resources available on the Web, including ontologies.
* Open Ontology Repository initiative
* ROMULUS is a foundational ontology repository aimed at improving semantic interoperability. Currently there are three foundational ontologies in the repository: DOLCE, BFO and GFO.

== Examples of applications ==
In general, ontologies can be used beneficially in several fields.
* Enterprise applications. A more concrete example is SAPPHIRE (Health care) or &quot;Situational Awareness and Preparedness for Public Health Incidences and Reasoning Engines&quot; which is a semantics-based health information system capable of tracking and evaluating situations and occurrences that may affect public health.
* Geographic information systems bring together data from different sources and benefit therefore from ontological metadata which helps to connect the semantics of the data.
* Domain-specific ontologies are extremely important in biomedical research, which requires named entity disambiguation of various biomedical terms and abbreviations that have the same string of characters but represent different biomedical concepts. For example, CSF can represent Colony Stimulating Factor or Cerebral Spinal Fluid, both of which are represented by the same term, CSF, in biomedical literature. This is why a large number of public ontologies are related to the life sciences. Life science data science tools that fail to implement these types of biomedical ontologies will not be able to accurately determine causal relationships between concepts.

<text>Auster Aircraft Limited was a British aircraft manufacturer from 1938 to 1961.

==History==
The company began in 1938 at the Britannia Works, Thurmaston near Leicester, England, as Taylorcraft Aeroplanes (England) Limited, making light observation aircraft designed by the Taylorcraft Aircraft Corporation of America. 1,604 high-wing Taylorcraft Auster monoplanes were built during World War II for the armed forces of the UK and Canada, primarily for the role of air observation post (AOP).

During the war the head office and drawing office were at a big old house on the outskirts of Thurmaston called &quot;The Woodlands&quot;. The fuselages and wings were manufactured at Syston under the works manager by the name of Sharp. Sheet metalwork was done at the old &#x27;en tout cas&#x27; works at Thurmaston. Final assembly, fitting out and testing took place at Rearsby aerodrome. The name changed to Auster (after the Roman name for the south wind) on 7 March 1946, when production shifted to Rearsby aerodrome, all in Leicestershire. All designs were evolved from the early Taylorcraft with a sprung skid or tailwheel beneath the fin (except for a low-wing aircraft called the &quot;Agricola&quot; designed for aerial farming work; only nine of these were completed). When the company was merged into Beagle Aircraft in June, 1961, the high-wing design was developed still further as the Terrier and, with a nosewheel, the Airedale.

The Auster name was dropped in 1962 after Beagle Aircraft was created.

<text>A handicraft is a traditional main sector of craft making and applies to a wide range of creative and design activities that are related to making things with one&#x27;s hands and skill, including work with textiles, moldable and rigid materials, paper, plant fibers, clay, etc. One of the oldest handicraft is Dhokra; this is a sort of metal casting that has been used in India for over 5,000 years and is still used. In Iranian Baluchistan, women still make red ware hand-made pottery with dotted ornaments, much similar to the 4,000-year-old pottery tradition of Kalpurgan, an archaeological site near the village. Usually, the term is applied to traditional techniques of creating items (whether for personal use or as products) that are both practical and aesthetic. Handicraft industries are those that produce things with hands to meet the needs of the people in their locality without using machines.

Collective terms for handicrafts include artisanry, crafting, and handcrafting. The term arts and crafts is also applied, especially in the United States and mostly to hobbyists&#x27; and children&#x27;s output rather than items crafted for daily use, but this distinction is not formal, and the term is easily confused with the Arts and Crafts design movement, which is in fact as practical as it is aesthetic.

Handicraft has its roots in the rural crafts—the material-goods necessities—of ancient civilizations, and many specific crafts have been practiced for centuries, while others are modern inventions or popularizations of crafts which were originally practiced in a limited geographic area.

Many handcrafters use natural, even entirely indigenous, materials while others may prefer modern, non-traditional materials, and even upcycle industrial materials. The individual artisanship of a handcrafted item is the paramount criterion; those made by mass production or machines are not handicraft goods.

Seen as developing the skills and creative interests of students, generally and sometimes towards a particular craft or trade, handicrafts are often integrated into educational systems, both informally and formally. Most crafts require the development of skill and the application of patience but can be learned by virtually anyone.

Like folk art, handicraft output often has cultural and/or religious significance, and increasingly may have a political message as well, as in craftivism. Many crafts become very popular for brief periods of time (a few months, or a few years), spreading rapidly among the crafting population as everyone emulates the first examples, then their popularity wanes until a later resurgence.

== The Arts and Crafts movement in the West ==
The Arts and Crafts movement originated as a late-19th-century design reform and social movement principally in Europe, North America and Australia, and continues today. Its proponents are motivated by the ideals of movement founders, such as William Morris and John Ruskin, who proposed that in pre-industrial societies, such as the European Middle Ages, people had achieved fulfillment through the creative process of handicrafts. This was held up in contrast to what was perceived to be the alienating effects of industrial labor.
These activities were called &quot;crafts&quot; because originally many of them were professions under the guild system. Adolescents were apprenticed to a master craftsman and refined their skills over a period of years in exchange for low wages. By the time their training was complete, they were well equipped to set up in trade for themselves, earning their living with the skill that could be traded directly within the community, often for goods and services. The Industrial Revolution and the increasing mechanization of production processes gradually reduced or eliminated many of the roles professional craftspeople played, and today many handicrafts are increasingly seen, especially when no longer the mainstay of a formal vocational trade, as a form of hobby, folk art and sometimes fine art.

The term &quot;handicrafts&quot; can also refer to the products themselves of such artisanal efforts, that require specialized knowledge, maybe highly technical in their execution, require specialized equipment and/or facilities to produce, involve manual labor or a blue-collar work ethic, are accessible to the general public, and are constructed from materials with histories that exceed the boundaries of Western &quot;fine art&quot; tradition, such as ceramics, glass, textiles, metal and wood. These products are produced within a specific community of practice, and while they mostly differ from the products produced within the communities of art and design, the boundaries often overlap, resulting in hybrid objects. Additionally, as the interpretation and validation of art is frequently a matter of context, an audience may perceive handcrafted objects as art objects when these objects are viewed within an art context, such as in a museum or in a position of prominence in one&#x27;s home.

== In modern education ==
Simple &quot;arts and crafts&quot; projects are a common elementary and middle school activity in both mainstream and alternative education systems around the world.

In some of the Scandinavian or Nordic countries, more advanced handicrafts form part of the formal, compulsory school curriculum, and are collectively referred to as &quot;slöjd&quot; in Swedish, and &quot;käsityö&quot; in Finnish. Students learn how to work mainly with metal, textile and wood, not for professional training purposes as in American vocational–technical schools, but with the aim to develop children&#x27;s and teens&#x27; practical skills, such as everyday problem-solving ability, tool use, and understanding of the materials that surround us for economical, cultural and environmental purposes.

Secondary schools and college and university art departments increasingly provide elective options for more handicraft-based arts, in addition to formal &quot;fine arts&quot;, a distinction that continues to fade throughout the years, especially with the rise of studio craft, i.e. the use of traditional handicrafts techniques by professional fine artists.

Many community centers and schools run evening or day classes and workshops, for adults and children, offering to teach basic craft skills in a short period of time.



== Handicraft production ==
Handicraft production is a small–scale production of products using manual labor. It was especially common in the Middle Ages, during the era of the Industrial Revolution it was mainly supplanted by mass production, however, it still exists for the production of goods such as luxury goods. The &quot;handmade effect&quot; is a phenomenon where consumers exhibit a preference for products that are crafted by human labor rather than produced through automated or robotic processes. This preference is particularly pronounced for products with higher symbolic value, where expressing one&#x27;s beliefs and personality holds greater significance. Consumers, especially in contexts emphasizing symbolic consumption, have a stronger motivation for uniqueness and associate human labor more closely with product uniqueness. In product categories where mechanical production is common, consumers are more attracted to products labeled as handmade. The positive handmade effect on product attractiveness is driven, in large part, by the perception that handmade products symbolically &quot;contain love.&quot; The handmade effect is influenced by two key factors. Firstly, consumers express stronger intentions to purchase handmade products when buying gifts for loved ones, compared to more distant recipients. Secondly, they are willing to pay a higher price for handmade gifts when the purchase is motivated by the desire to convey love rather than simply acquiring the best-performing product.

The handicraft method of production has been used by people since ancient times. Initially, people engaged in handicraft production aimed to satisfy the needs of their own economy, however, with the development of commodity–money relations, an increasing number of goods produced by them began to be supplied to the market. Mostly these were household products: dishes, furniture, jewelry, souvenirs, clothes, shoes. However, over time, other goods, such as weapons, began to go on sale.

In pre–revolutionary Russia, handicraft production was quite widespread: about 30% of all manufactured products were produced by handicraft methods. Products were sold at fairs, and barter exchange was widespread. With the beginning of industrialisation and collectivization of the Soviet Union, the handicraft mode of production was declared &quot;the highest degree of oppression of the working people&quot; and ceased to exist in almost all spheres of the Soviet economy except on an informal basis.

Some state economies, such as that of Vietnam, are largely based on handicraft production. For example, in the 1950s in North Vietnam, there were more than 100,000 handicraft enterprises. In the early 1970s, even before the end of the war, handicraft production provided about half of all the products of the local industry and almost a third of the total industrial production of the republic. By 1977, after the reunification of Vietnam, there were 700,000 handicraftsmen in South Vietnam.

Handicraft production in Nepal withstands competition with industrial production and foreign goods, which is explained not only by economic and natural–geographical factors, but also by the support and encouragement of the handicraft industry from the state.

Vietnam&#x27;s handicrafts industry currently has about 600 villages, with over 10 million direct workers.

Wickerwork is a traditional handicraft industry, based on the use of two basic materials, bamboo and rattan. Vietnam currently has 893 villages specializing in wickerwork, accounting for 24% of the total number of villages, including 647 bamboo and rattan villages and 246 straw and water hyacinth villages.

<text>Aviation Traders Limited (ATL) was a war-surplus aircraft and spares trader formed in 1947. In 1949, it began maintaining aircraft used by some of Britain&#x27;s contemporary independent airlines on the Berlin Airlift. In the early 1950s, it branched out into aircraft conversions and manufacturing. During that period it also became a subcontractor for other aircraft manufacturers. By the end of the decade, it was taken over by the Airwork group.

==History==
Aviation Traders Ltd. (ATL) was established by Freddie Laker at Bovingdon in Hertfordshire, England, in 1947 to trade in war-surplus aircraft and spares. Two years later, Laker shifted his fledgling business to new premises at Rochford aerodrome (later Southend Municipal Airport) near Southend-on-Sea, Essex, England.

ATL initially specialised in converting numerous war-surplus bombers and transporters into freighters. This included the conversion of Handley Page Halifax bombers into freighters, six of which were sold to Bond Air Services, an early post-war independent British airline. Bond Air Services based these planes at Wunstorf aerodrome in West Germany to carry essential supplies into West Berlin during the Berlin Blockade of 1948–49. Bond Air Services furthermore contracted Aviation Traders to service these planes. In return, Aviation Traders got half of Bond Air Services&#x27; freight charges. Following the end of the Berlin Airlift in 1949, Laker had most of the Halifaxes he had supplied to various independent airlines during the Airlift scrapped at its Southend facilities.

Aviation Traders (Engineering) Ltd – (ATEL), ATL&#x27;s engineering division, was formally established in 1949. Laker put Jack Wiseman, a fully qualified aircraft maintenance engineer with whom he had worked for a brief period at London Aero Motor Services (LASM), in charge of his new engineering business.

Three former British European Airways (BEA) Vickers Vikings, which Laker had acquired in 1949 as well, were overhauled at ATL&#x27;s Southend maintenance base and sold on to British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) at a profit.

The following year, ATL&#x27;s engineering arm cannibalised a number of unairworthy Yorks and Lancasters Laker had purchased to rebuild the salvaged parts into three airworthy Yorks.

ATL also became one of many post-war aircraft manufacturers which attempted to develop a successor to the ubiquitous Douglas DC-3 piston-engine airliner.

ATL&#x27;s answer was the 28 passenger ATL-90 Accountant powered by two Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engines, which first flew on 9 July 1957, however ATL&#x27;s design was competing against a large number of designs from well-established aircraft manufacturers with much deeper pockets and could not match the scale of their investments, either in the design and development or in marketing it. Competing designs including the Convair CV-240 series, Fokker F-27 Friendship and Vickers VC.1 Viking also saturated the market. As a consequence, the Accountant failed to attract orders, which led to the programme&#x27;s termination and in the prototype&#x27;s destruction.

Subsequent conversion work was more successful. Avro Tudor airliners were fitted with large side freight doors for Air Charter Ltd (one of ATL&#x27;s sister companies) as &quot;Supertraders&quot;.

Twenty-one Douglas DC-4 airliners were converted into car ferries as the ATL-98 Carvair, a major rebuild that replaced the aircraft&#x27;s original nose with an enlarged version that raised the cockpit above the cargo hold and added a hinged nose through which five cars could be loaded with a mobile scissor lift. Twenty-five passengers could be carried in the unaltered rear fuselage while the fin was enlarged to offset the increased side area of the new forward fuselage. Carvairs were operated from Southend Airport on short air ferry routes across the English Channel or North Sea where they supplemented Bristol Freighters already being used in the same role. High speed car ferry service by large hovercraft such as the SR.N4 meant an end to the service.

ATL installed unused Rolls-Royce Merlins in ex-BOAC &quot;Canadair Argonaut (North Star)&quot; airliners. The engines were acquired earlier along with ex-BOAC Halifaxes and several Avro Tudors purchased from the British Government.

In 1951, ATL won a contract from Bristol Aircraft to manufacture wing centre sections for Bristol Freighters. Between the beginning of 1952 and the end of 1955, ATL built 50 wing sections for Bristol Aircraft. During that period ATL had grown into a large engineering and manufacturing organisation.

In 1956, ATL purchased over 250 surplus ex-Royal Air Force Percival Prentice trainers, about 20 of which were converted for civilian customers.

In 1958, Laker announced his decision to sell both ATL and Air Charter to Airwork for £600,000 cash plus a further £200,000, subject to the valuation of stock. The deal became effective in January 1959, when both companies joined the Airwork group.

In 1996, Britavia, which was part of Airwork and was the design arm of Shorts Support Services ceased trading as Britavia and was subject to a Management Buy-Out, and started trading again as Aviation Traders Limited (ATL) based at Bournemouth Airport until 2016. In 2016 ATL moved to their current offices in Wimborne. ATL provided approved design services under the CAA reference of DAI/9525/96. With the introduction of EASA, ATL moved under the control of EASA and transferred to a Design Organisation Approval (DOA) under Part 21J and now certifies and designs fixed and rotary wing modifications under approval reference EASA.21J.016. ATL are currently opening a European company and office to continue following BREXIT.

<doc id="49693" wikidata="Q251537" url="?curid=49693" title="Gain (antenna)">
<text>In electromagnetics, an antenna&#x27;s gain is a key performance parameter which combines the antenna&#x27;s directivity and radiation efficiency. The term &quot;power gain&quot; has been deprecated by IEEE. In a transmitting antenna, the gain describes how well the antenna converts input power into radio waves headed in a specified direction. In a receiving antenna, the gain describes how well the antenna converts radio waves arriving from a specified direction into electrical power. When no direction is specified, gain is understood to refer to the peak value of the gain, the gain in the direction of the antenna&#x27;s main lobe. A plot of the gain as a function of direction is called the antenna pattern or radiation pattern. It is not to be confused with directivity, which does &quot;not&quot; take an antenna&#x27;s radiation efficiency into account.

Gain or &#x27;absolute gain&#x27; is defined as &quot;The ratio of the radiation intensity in a given direction to the radiation intensity that would be produced if the power accepted by the antenna were isotropically radiated&quot;. Usually this ratio is expressed in decibels with respect to an isotropic radiator (dBi). An alternative definition compares the received power to the power received by a lossless half-wave dipole antenna, in which case the units are written as &quot;dBd&quot;. Since a lossless dipole antenna has a gain of 2.15 dBi, the relation between these units is formula_1. For a given frequency, the antenna&#x27;s effective area is proportional to the gain. An antenna&#x27;s effective length is proportional to the &quot;square root&quot; of the antenna&#x27;s gain for a particular frequency and radiation resistance. Due to reciprocity, the gain of any antenna when receiving is equal to its gain when transmitting.

==Gain==

Gain is a unitless measure that multiplies an antenna&#x27;s radiation efficiency &quot;formula_2&quot; and directivity &quot;D&quot;:

:formula_3

==Radiation efficiency==

The radiation efficiency formula_2 of an antenna is &quot;The ratio of the total power radiated by an antenna to the net power accepted by the antenna from the connected transmitter.&quot;
:formula_5

A transmitting antenna is supplied with power by a transmission line connecting the antenna to a radio transmitter. The power accepted by the antenna formula_6 is the power supplied to the antenna&#x27;s terminals. Losses prior to the antenna terminals are accounted for by separate impedance mismatch factors which are therefore not included in the calculation of radiation efficiency.

==Gain in decibels==
Published numbers for antenna gain are almost always expressed in decibels (dB), a logarithmic scale. From the gain factor G, one finds the gain in decibels as:
:formula_7

Therefore, an antenna with a peak power gain of 5 would be said to have a gain of 7 dBi. dBi is used rather than just dB to emphasize that this is the gain according to the basic definition, in which the antenna is compared to an isotropic radiator.

When actual measurements of an antenna&#x27;s gain are made by a laboratory, the field strength of the test antenna is measured when supplied with, say, 1 watt of transmitter power, at a certain distance. That field strength is compared to the field strength found using a so-called &quot;reference antenna&quot; at the same distance receiving the same power in order to determine the gain of the antenna under test. That ratio would be equal to &quot;G&quot; if the reference antenna were an isotropic radiator (irad).

However a true isotropic radiator cannot be built, so in practice a different antenna is used. This will often be a half-wave dipole, a very well understood and repeatable antenna that can be easily built for any frequency. The directive gain of a half-wave dipole with respect to the isotropic radiator is known to be 1.64 and it can be made nearly 100% efficient. Since the gain has been measured with respect to this reference antenna, the difference in the gain of the test antenna is often compared to that of the dipole. The gain relative to a dipole is thus often quoted and is denoted using dBd instead of dBi to avoid confusion. Therefore, in terms of the true gain (relative to an isotropic radiator) &quot;G&quot;, this figure for the gain is given by:
:formula_8

For instance, the above antenna with a gain &quot;G&quot; = 5 would have a gain with respect to a dipole of 5/1.64 ≈ 3.05, or in decibels one would call this 10 log(3.05) ≈ 4.84 dBd. In general:
:formula_9

Both dBi and dBd are in common use. When an antenna&#x27;s maximum gain is specified in decibels (for instance, by a manufacturer) one must be certain as to whether this means the gain relative to an isotropic radiator or with respect to a dipole. If it specifies dBi or dBd then there is no ambiguity, but if only dB is specified then the fine print must be consulted. Either figure can be easily converted into the other using the above relationship.

When considering an antenna&#x27;s directional pattern, gain with respect to a dipole does &quot;not&quot; imply a comparison of that antenna&#x27;s gain in each direction to a dipole&#x27;s gain in that direction. Rather, it is a comparison between the antenna&#x27;s gain in each direction to the &quot;peak&quot; gain of the dipole (1.64). In any direction, therefore, such numbers are 2.15 dB smaller than the gain expressed in dBi.

==Partial gain==
Partial gain is calculated as power gain, but for a particular polarization. It is defined as the part of the radiation intensity formula_10 corresponding to a given polarization, divided by the total radiation intensity of an isotropic antenna.

The partial gains in the formula_11 and formula_12 components are expressed as

:formula_13

and

:formula_14,

where formula_15 and formula_16 represent the radiation intensity in a given direction contained in their respective formula_17 field component.

As a result of this definition, we can conclude that the total gain of an antenna is the sum of partial gains for any two orthogonal polarizations.

:formula_18

==Examples==

===First example===
Suppose a lossless antenna has a radiation pattern given by:

:formula_19

Let us find the gain of such an antenna. First we find the peak radiation intensity of this antenna:

:formula_20

The total radiated power can be found by integrating over all directions:

:formula_21

Since the antenna is specified as being lossless the radiation efficiency is 1. The maximum gain is then equal to:

:formula_22

Expressed relative to the gain of a half-wave dipole we would find:

:formula_23.

===Second example===

As an example, consider an antenna that radiates an electromagnetic wave whose electrical field has an amplitude formula_24 at a distance formula_25 That amplitude is given by:
: formula_26
where:
* formula_27 is the current (in Amps) fed to the antenna and
* formula_28 is a characteristic constant (in Ohm) of each antenna.

For a large distance formula_25 The radiated wave can be considered locally as a plane wave. The intensity of an electromagnetic plane wave is:
:: formula_30
where 
: formula_31 is a universal constant called vacuum impedance.
and
: formula_32
If the resistive part of the series impedance of the antenna is formula_33 the power fed to the antenna is formula_34 The intensity of an isotropic antenna is the power so fed divided by the surface of the sphere of radius :
: formula_35
:: (In most cases 73.130, is adequate)

:formula_36
:: (Likewise, 1.64 and 2.15 dBi are usually the cited values)

Sometimes, the half-wave dipole is taken as a reference instead of the isotropic radiator. The gain is then given in dBd (decibels over dipole):
:: 0 dBd = 2.15 dBi

== Realized gain ==
Realized gain differs from gain in that it is &quot;reduced by its impedance mismatch factor.&quot; This mismatch induces losses above the dissipative losses described above; therefore, realized gain will always be less than gain. Gain may be expressed as absolute gain if further clarification is required to differentiate it from realized gain.

==Total radiated power==
Total radiated power (TRP) is the sum of all RF power radiated by the antenna when the source power is included in the measurement. TRP is expressed in watts or the corresponding logarithmic expressions, often dBm or dBW.

When testing mobile devices, TRP can be measured while in close proximity of power-absorbing losses such as the body and hand of the user.

The TRP can be used to determine body loss (BoL). The body loss is considered as the ratio of TRP measured in the presence of losses and TRP measured while in free space.

<text>Adrien-Marie Legendre (; ; 18 September 1752 – 9 January 1833) was a French mathematician who made numerous contributions to mathematics. Well-known and important concepts such as the Legendre polynomials and Legendre transformation are named after him. He is also known for his contributions to the method of least squares, and was the first to officially publish on it, though Carl Friedrich Gauss had discovered it before him.

== Life ==
Adrien-Marie Legendre was born in Paris on 18 September 1752 to a wealthy family. He received his education at the Collège Mazarin in Paris, and defended his thesis in physics and mathematics in 1770. He taught at the École Militaire in Paris from 1775 to 1780 and at the École Normale from 1795. At the same time, he was associated with the Bureau des Longitudes. In 1782, the Berlin Academy awarded Legendre a prize for his treatise on projectiles in resistant media. This treatise also brought him to the attention of Lagrange.

The &quot;Académie des sciences&quot; made Legendre an adjoint member in 1783 and an associate in 1785. In 1789, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

He assisted with the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790) to calculate the precise distance between the Paris Observatory and the Royal Greenwich Observatory by means of trigonometry. To this end in 1787 he visited Dover and London together with Dominique, comte de Cassini and Pierre Méchain. The three also visited William Herschel, the discoverer of the planet Uranus.

Legendre lost his private fortune in 1793 during the French Revolution. That year, he also married Marguerite-Claudine Couhin, who helped him put his affairs in order. In 1795, Legendre became one of six members of the mathematics section of the reconstituted Académie des Sciences, renamed the Institut National des Sciences et des Arts. Later, in 1803, Napoleon reorganized the Institut National, and Legendre became a member of the Geometry section. From 1799 to 1812, Legendre served as mathematics examiner for graduating artillery students at the École Militaire and from 1799 to 1815 he served as permanent mathematics examiner for the École Polytechnique. In 1824, Legendre&#x27;s pension from the École Militaire was stopped because he refused to vote for the government candidate at the Institut National. In 1831, he was made an officer of the Légion d&#x27;Honneur.

Legendre died in Paris on 9 January 1833, after a long and painful illness, and Legendre&#x27;s widow carefully preserved his belongings to memorialize him. Upon her death in 1856, she was buried next to her husband in the village of Auteuil, where the couple had lived, and left their last country house to the village. Legendre&#x27;s name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.
== Mathematical work==
Abel&#x27;s work on elliptic functions was built on Legendre&#x27;s, and some of Gauss&#x27;s work in statistics and number theory completed that of Legendre. He developed, and first communicated to his contemporaries before Gauss, the least squares method which has broad application in linear regression, signal processing, statistics, and curve fitting; this was published in 1806 as an appendix to his book on the paths of comets. Today, the term &quot;least squares method&quot; is used as a direct translation from the French &quot;méthode des moindres carrés&quot;.

His major work is &quot;Exercices de Calcul Intégral&quot;, published in three volumes in 1811, 1817 and 1819. In the first volume he introduced the basic properties of elliptic integrals, beta functions and gamma functions, introducing the symbol Γ and normalizing it to Γ(n+1) = n!. Further results on the beta and gamma functions along with their applications to mechanics – such as the rotation of the earth, and the attraction of ellipsoids – appeared in the second volume. In 1830, he gave a proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem for exponent &quot;n&quot; = 5, which was also proven by Lejeune Dirichlet in 1828.

In number theory, he conjectured the quadratic reciprocity law, subsequently proved by Gauss; in connection to this, the Legendre symbol is named after him. He also did pioneering work on the distribution of primes, and on the application of analysis to number theory. His 1798 conjecture of the prime number theorem was rigorously proved by Hadamard and de la Vallée-Poussin in 1896.

Legendre did an impressive amount of work on elliptic functions, including the classification of elliptic integrals, but it took Abel&#x27;s study of the inverses of Jacobi&#x27;s functions to solve the problem completely.

He is known for the Legendre transformation, which is used to go from the Lagrangian to the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics. In thermodynamics it is also used to obtain the enthalpy and the Helmholtz and Gibbs (free) energies from the internal energy. He is also the namesake of the Legendre polynomials, solutions to Legendre&#x27;s differential equation, which occur frequently in physics and engineering applications, such as electrostatics.

Legendre is best known as the author of &quot;Éléments de géométrie&quot;, which was published in 1794 and was the leading elementary text on the topic for around 100 years. This text greatly rearranged and simplified many of the propositions from Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; to create a more effective textbook.

==Mistaken portrait==
For two centuries, until the recent discovery of the error in 2005, books, paintings and articles have incorrectly shown a profile portrait of the obscure French politician Louis Legendre (1752–1797) as a portrait of the mathematician. The error arose from the fact that the sketch was labelled simply &quot;Legendre&quot; and appeared in a book along with contemporary mathematicians such as Lagrange. The only known portrait of Legendre, rediscovered in 2008, is found in the 1820 book &quot;Album de 73 portraits-charge aquarellés des membres de I&#x27;Institut&quot;, a book of caricatures of seventy-three members of the Institut de France in Paris by the French artist Julien-Léopold Boilly as shown below:

<doc id="49696" wikidata="Q151599" url="?curid=49696" title="Metropolis (1927 film)">
<text>Metropolis is a 1927 German expressionist science-fiction silent film directed by Fritz Lang and written by Thea von Harbou in collaboration with Lang from von Harbou&#x27;s 1925 novel of the same name (which was intentionally written as a treatment). It stars Gustav Fröhlich, Alfred Abel, Rudolf Klein-Rogge, and Brigitte Helm. Erich Pommer produced it in the Babelsberg Studio for Universum Film A.G. (UFA). &quot;Metropolis&quot; is regarded as a pioneering science-fiction film, being among the first feature-length ones of that genre. Filming took place over 17 months in 1925–26 at a cost of more than five million Reichsmarks, or the equivalent of about € million.

Made in Germany during the Weimar period, &quot;Metropolis&quot; is set in a futuristic urban dystopia and follows the attempts of Freder, the wealthy son of the city master, and Maria, a saintly figure to the workers, to overcome the vast gulf separating the classes in their city and bring the workers together with Joh Fredersen, the city master. The film&#x27;s message is encompassed in the final inter-title: &quot;The Mediator Between the Head and the Hands Must Be the Heart&quot;.

&quot;Metropolis&quot; met a mixed reception upon release. Critics found it visually beautiful and powerful – the film&#x27;s art direction by Otto Hunte, Erich Kettelhut, and Karl Vollbrecht draws influence from opera, Bauhaus, Cubist, and Futurist design, along with touches of the Gothic in the scenes in the catacombs, the cathedral and Rotwang&#x27;s house – and lauded its complex special effects, but accused its story of being naive. H. G. Wells described the film as &quot;silly&quot;, and &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; calls the story &quot;trite&quot; and its politics &quot;ludicrously simplistic&quot;. Its alleged communist message was also criticized.

The film&#x27;s long running time also came in for criticism. It was cut substantially after its German premiere. Many attempts have been made since the 1970s to restore the film. In 1984, Italian music producer Giorgio Moroder released a truncated version with a soundtrack by rock artists including Freddie Mercury, Loverboy, and Adam Ant. In 2001, a new reconstruction of &quot;Metropolis&quot; was shown at the Berlin Film Festival. In 2008, a damaged print of Lang&#x27;s original cut of the film was found in a museum in Argentina. According to the explanation in the restored film, &quot;the material was heavily damaged and, because it had been printed on 16mm film stock, does not have the full-aperture silent picture ratio&quot; and &quot;in order to maintain the scale of the restored footage, the missing portion of the frame appears black&quot; while &quot;black frames indicate points at which footage is still lost&quot;. After a long restoration process that required additional materials provided by a print from New Zealand, the film was 95% restored and shown on large screens in Berlin and Frankfurt simultaneously on 12 February 2010.

&quot;Metropolis&quot; is now widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, ranking 67th in &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;″s 2022 critics&#x27; poll, and receiving general critical acclaim. In 2001, the film was inscribed on UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Register, the first film thus distinguished. 
On 1 January 2023, the film&#x27;s American reserved copyright expired, thereby entering the film into the public domain.

==Plot==

In the future, wealthy industrialists and business magnates and their top employees reign over the city of Metropolis from colossal skyscrapers, while underground-dwelling workers toil to operate the great machines that power it. Joh Fredersen is the city&#x27;s master. His son, Freder, idles away his time at sports and in a pleasure garden, but is interrupted by the arrival of a young woman named Maria, who has brought a group of workers&#x27; children to witness the lifestyle of their rich &quot;brothers&quot;. 

Maria and the children are ushered away, but Freder becomes fascinated by her. Against the strict rules of the city, he enters the lower levels in disguise to find her. In the machine halls, he witnesses the explosion of a huge machine that kills and injures numerous workers. Freder has a hallucination that the machine is a temple of Moloch and the workers are being fed to it. When the hallucination ends, and he sees the dead workers being carried away on stretchers, he hurries to tell his father about the accident.

Grot, foreman of the Heart Machine, brings Fredersen strange maps found on the dead workers. Fredersen fires his assistant Josaphat for not being the first to bring him details about the explosion or the maps. After seeing his father&#x27;s cold indifference towards the harsh conditions faced by the workers, Freder secretly rebels by deciding to help them. He enlists Josaphat&#x27;s assistance and returns to the machine halls, assuming the identity of an ill worker.
Fredersen takes the maps to the city&#x27;s greatest inventor, Rotwang, to learn their meaning. Rotwang had been in love with a woman named Hel, who left him to marry Fredersen and later died giving birth to Freder. Rotwang shows Fredersen a robot he has built to &quot;resurrect&quot; Hel. The maps show a network of catacombs beneath Metropolis, and the two men go to investigate. They eavesdrop on a gathering of workers, including Freder. Maria addresses them, prophesying the arrival of a mediator who can bring the working and ruling classes together. Freder believes he can fill the role and declares his love for Maria. 

Fredersen orders Rotwang to give Maria&#x27;s likeness to the robot so that it can discredit her among the workers but is unaware that Rotwang&#x27;s true plan is to usurp him as ruler by sparking a revolution. Rotwang kidnaps Maria, fashions the robot in her image, and presents her to Fredersen. Freder finds the two embracing and, believing his father to have betrayed him, falls into a prolonged delirium. Intercut with his hallucinations, the false Maria preaches to the workers that they must rise up against the surface world, resulting in chaos and dissent.

Freder recovers and returns to the catacombs, accompanied by Josaphat. Finding the false Maria urging the workers to destroy the machines, he accuses her of not being the real Maria. The workers ignore him and carry out her wishes, smashing the machines and triggering a great flood that threatens to drown their children. The real Maria, having escaped from Rotwang&#x27;s house, rescues the children with help from Freder and Josaphat. Grot berates the celebrating workers for abandoning their children in the flooded city. The workers become hysterical and condemn the false Maria, burning her at the stake. A horrified Freder watches until the fire reveals her to be a robot. Rotwang, insanely believing Maria to be a reincarnated Hel, chases her to the roof of the cathedral, pursued by Freder. The two men fight as Fredersen and the workers watch from the street, and Rotwang falls to his death. Freder fulfills his destiny to unite the city and the underworld by linking the hands of Fredersen and Grot to bring them together.

==Influences==
&quot;Metropolis&quot; features a range of elaborate special effects and set designs, ranging from a huge gothic cathedral to a futuristic cityscape. In an interview, Fritz Lang reported that &quot;the film was born from my first sight of the skyscrapers in New York in October 1924&quot;. He had visited New York City for the first time and remarked &quot;I looked into the streets—the glaring lights and the tall buildings—and there I conceived &quot;Metropolis&quot;,&quot; although in actuality Lang and Harbou had been at work on the idea for over a year. Describing his first impressions of the city, Lang said that &quot;the buildings seemed to be a vertical sail, scintillating and very light, a luxurious backdrop, suspended in the dark sky to dazzle, distract and hypnotize&quot;. He added &quot;The sight of Neuyork [sic] alone should be enough to turn this beacon of beauty into the center of a film...&quot;

The appearance of the city in &quot;Metropolis&quot; is strongly informed by the Art Deco movement; however, it also incorporates elements from other traditions. Ingeborg Hoesterey described the architecture featured in &quot;Metropolis&quot; as eclectic, writing how its locales represent both &quot;functionalist modernism [and] art deco&quot; whilst also featuring &quot;the scientist&#x27;s archaic little house with its high-powered laboratory, the catacombs [and] the Gothic cathedral&quot;. The film&#x27;s use of art deco architecture was highly influential, and has been reported to have contributed to the style&#x27;s subsequent popularity in Europe and America. The New Babel Tower, for instance, has been inspired by Upper Silesian Tower in Poznań fairgrounds, which was recognized in Germany as a masterpiece of architecture.

Lang&#x27;s visit to several Hollywood studios in the same 1924 trip also influenced the film in another way: Lang and producer Erich Pommer realized that to compete with the vertical integration of Hollywood, their next film would have to be bigger, broader, and better made than anything they had made before. Despite UFA&#x27;s growing debt, Lang announced that &quot;Metropolis&quot; would be &quot;the costliest and most ambitious picture ever.&quot;

The film drew heavily on biblical sources for several of its key set-pieces. During her first talk to the workers, Maria uses the story of the Tower of Babel to highlight the discord between the intellectuals and the workers. Additionally, a delusional Freder imagines the false-Maria as the Whore of Babylon, riding on the back of a many-headed dragon.

The name of the Yoshiwara club alludes to the famous red-light district of Tokyo.

Much of the plot line of &quot;Metropolis&quot; stems from the First World War and the culture of the Weimar Republic in Germany. Lang explores the themes of industrialization and mass production in his film; two developments that played a large role in the war. Other post-World War I themes that Lang includes in &quot;Metropolis&quot; include the Weimar view of American modernity, fascism, and communism.

==Production==
===Pre-production===
&quot;Metropolis&quot;&#x27;s screenplay was written by Thea von Harbou, a popular writer in Weimar Germany, jointly with Lang, her then-husband. The film&#x27;s plot originated from a novel of the same title written by Harbou for the sole purpose of being made into a film. The novel in turn drew inspiration from H. G. Wells, Mary Shelley and Villiers de l&#x27;Isle-Adam&#x27;s works and other German dramas. The novel featured strongly in the film&#x27;s marketing campaign, and was serialized in the journal &quot;Illustriertes Blatt&quot; in the run-up to its release. Harbou and Lang collaborated on the screenplay derived from the novel, and several plot points and thematic elements—including most of the references to magic and occultism present in the novel—were dropped.
The screenplay itself went through many rewrites, and at one point featured an ending where Freder flew to the stars; this plot element later became the basis for Lang&#x27;s &quot;Woman in the Moon&quot;. The time setting of &quot;Metropolis&quot; is open to interpretation. The 2010 re-release and reconstruction, which incorporated the original title cards written by Thea von Harbou, do not specify a year. Before the reconstruction, Lotte Eisner and Paul M. Jensen placed the events happening around the year 2000. Giorgio Moroder&#x27;s re-scored version included a title card placing the film in 2026, while Paramount&#x27;s original US release said the film takes place in 3000.

A note in one edition of Harbou&#x27;s novel says that the story does not take place at any particular place or time, in the past or the future. Meanwhile, the 1963 Ace Books edition, which is a reprint of the 1927 English edition, specifies the setting as &quot;The World of 2026 A.D.&quot;.

===Filming===
On 22 May 1925, &quot;Metropolis&quot; began principal photography with an initial budget of . Lang cast two unknowns with little film experience in the lead roles. Gustav Fröhlich (Freder) had worked in vaudeville and was originally employed as an extra on &quot;Metropolis&quot; before Thea von Harbou recommended him to Lang. Brigitte Helm (Maria) had been given a screen test by Lang after he met her on the set of &quot;Die Nibelungen&quot;, but would make her feature film debut with &quot;Metropolis&quot;. In the role of Joh Fredersen, Lang cast Alfred Abel, a noted stage and screen actor whom he had worked with on &quot;Dr. Mabuse the Gambler&quot;. Lang also cast his frequent collaborator Rudolph Klein-Rogge in the role of Rotwang. This was Klein-Rogge&#x27;s fourth film with Lang, after &quot;Destiny&quot;, &quot;Dr. Mabuse the Gambler&quot;, and &quot;Die Nibelungen&quot;.

Shooting of the film was a draining experience for the actors involved due to the demands that Lang placed on them. For the scene where the workers&#x27; city was flooded, Helm and 500 children from the poorest districts of Berlin had to work for 14 days in a pool of water that Lang intentionally kept at a low temperature. Lang would frequently demand numerous re-takes, and took two days to shoot a simple scene where Freder collapses at Maria&#x27;s feet; by the time Lang was satisfied with the footage he had shot, actor Gustav Fröhlich found he could barely stand. Other anecdotes involve Lang&#x27;s insistence on using real fire for the climactic scene where the false Maria is burnt at the stake (which resulted in Helm&#x27;s dress catching fire), and his ordering extras to throw themselves towards powerful jets of water when filming the flooding of the workers&#x27; city.

Helm recalled her experiences of shooting the film in a contemporary interview, saying that &quot;the night shots lasted three weeks, and even if they did lead to the greatest dramatic moments—even if we did follow Fritz Lang&#x27;s directions as though in a trance, enthusiastic and enraptured at the same time—I can&#x27;t forget the incredible strain that they put us under. The work wasn&#x27;t easy, and the authenticity in the portrayal ended up testing our nerves now and then. For instance, it wasn&#x27;t fun at all when Grot drags me by the hair, to have me burned at the stake. Once I even fainted: during the transformation scene, Maria, as the android, is clamped in a kind of wooden armament, and because the shot took so long, I didn&#x27;t get enough air.&quot;

Despite the hardships, Thea von Harbou recounted how the film set was paradise for the hundreds of poor, malnourished children used as extras. In 1927 in &quot;Metropolis Magazine&quot;, von Harbou describes their warm and clean rooms, time for play, and ample toys and hot meals four times a day. &quot;No film ever had more enthusiastic and willing collaborators than these little children,&quot; she recalled, &quot;always willing to dash into the chilly water [...] like perfect actors&quot;.

UFA invited several trade journal representatives and several film critics to see the film&#x27;s shooting as parts of its promotion campaign.

Shooting lasted 17 months, with 310 shooting days and 60 shooting nights, and was finally completed on 30 October 1926. By the time shooting finished, the film&#x27;s budget leapt to 5.3 million Reichsmarks, or over three and a half times the original budget. Producer Erich Pommer had been fired during production.

===Special effects===
The effects expert Eugen Schüfftan created pioneering visual effects for &quot;Metropolis&quot;. Among the effects used are miniatures of the city, a camera on a swing, and most notably, the Schüfftan process, in which mirrors are used to create the illusion that actors are occupying miniature sets. This new technique was seen again just two years later in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;Blackmail&quot; (1929).

The &quot;Maschinenmensch&quot; – the robot built by Rotwang to resurrect his lost love Hel – was created by sculptor Walter Schulze-Mittendorff. A whole-body plaster cast was taken of actress Brigitte Helm, and the costume was then constructed around it. A chance discovery of a sample of &quot;plastic wood&quot; (a pliable substance designed as wood-filler) allowed Schulze-Mittendorff to build a costume that would both appear metallic and allow a small amount of free movement. Helm sustained cuts and bruises while in character as the robot, as the costume was rigid and uncomfortable.

==Music==
===Original score===
Gottfried Huppertz composed the film&#x27;s score for a large orchestra. He drew inspiration from Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss, and combined a classical orchestral style with mild modernist touches to portray the film&#x27;s massive industrial city of workers. Nestled within the original score were quotations of Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle&#x27;s &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; and the traditional &quot;Dies Irae&quot;, the latter of which was matched to the film&#x27;s apocalyptic imagery. Huppertz&#x27;s music played a prominent role during the film&#x27;s production; the composer often played piano on Lang&#x27;s set to inform the actors&#x27; performances. Huppertz&#x27;s score only accompanied the film once, at its original premiere. Sections of the score were recorded and released by the record label Vox.

The full score was not recorded until 2001, for the film&#x27;s first comprehensive restoration, with Berndt Heller conducting the Rundfunksinfonieorchester Saarbrücken. It was released internationally on various DVD editions beginning in 2003.

In 2007, Huppertz&#x27;s score was also played live by the VCS Radio Symphony, which accompanied the restored version of the film at Brenden Theatres in Vacaville, California. The score was also produced in a salon orchestration, which was performed for the first time in the United States in August 2007 by the Bijou Orchestra under the direction of Leo Najar as part of a German Expressionist film festival in Bay City, Michigan. The same forces also performed the work at the Traverse City Film Festival in Traverse City, Michigan in August 2009.

For the film&#x27;s 2010 &quot;complete&quot; restoration premiere, Huppertz&#x27;s score was performed live and subsequently re-recorded by the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Frank Strobel. This version was released internationally on various DVD and Blu-ray editions beginning in 2010.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Metropolis&quot; was distributed by Parufamet, a company formed in December 1925 by the American film studios Paramount Pictures and Metro Goldwyn Mayer to loan US$4 million to UFA. The film had its world premiere at the UFA-Palast am Zoo in Berlin on 10 January 1927, where the audience, including a critic from the &quot;Berliner Morgenpost&quot;, reacted to several of the film&#x27;s most spectacular scenes with &quot;spontaneous applause&quot;. However, others have suggested the premiere was met with muted applause interspersed with boos and hisses.

At the time of its German premiere, &quot;Metropolis&quot; had a length of 4,189 metres, which is approximately 153 minutes at 24 frames per second (fps). UFA&#x27;s distribution deal with Paramount and MGM &quot;entitled [them] to make any change [to films produced by UFA] they found appropriate to ensure profitability&quot;. Considering that &quot;Metropolis&quot; was too long and unwieldy, Parufamet commissioned American playwright Channing Pollock to write a simpler version of the film that could be assembled using the existing material. Pollock shortened the film dramatically, altered its inter-titles and removed all references to the character of Hel, because the name sounded too similar to the English word Hell, thereby removing Rotwang&#x27;s original motivation for creating his robot. Pollock said about the original film that it was &quot;symbolism run such riot that people who saw it couldn&#x27;t tell what the picture was about. ... I have given it my meaning.&quot; Lang&#x27;s response to the re-editing of the film was to say &quot;I love films, so I shall never go to America. Their experts have slashed my best film, &quot;Metropolis&quot;, so cruelly that I dare not see it while I am in England.&quot; The Hel storyline would be partially restored in Giorgio Moroder&#x27;s 1984 version, and subsequent versions completely restored it.

In Pollock&#x27;s cut, the film ran for 3,170 metres, or approximately 116 minutes—although a contemporary review in &quot;Variety&quot; of a showing in New York gave the running time as 107 minutes, and another source lists it at 105 minutes. This version of &quot;Metropolis&quot; premiered in the United States in March 1927, and was released, in a slightly different and longer version (128 minutes) in the United Kingdom around the same time with different title cards.

Alfred Hugenberg, a German nationalist businessman, cancelled UFA&#x27;s debt to Paramount and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer after taking charge of the company in April 1927, and chose to halt distribution in German cinemas of &quot;Metropolis&quot; in its original form. Hugenberg had the film cut down to a length of 3,241 metres (about 118 minutes), broadly along the lines of Pollock&#x27;s edit, removing the film&#x27;s perceived &quot;inappropriate&quot; communist subtext and religious imagery. Hugenberg&#x27;s cut of the film was released in German cinemas in August 1927. Later, after demands for more cuts by Nazi censors, UFA distributed a still shorter version of the film (2,530 metres, 91 minutes) in 1936, and an English version of this cut was archived in the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) film library in the 1930s. It was this version which was the basis of all versions of &quot;Metropolis&quot; until the later restorations. In 1986 it was recopied and returned to Germany to be the basis of the 1987 Munich Archive restoration.

===Original reception===
Despite the film&#x27;s later reputation, some contemporary critics panned it. &quot;Variety&quot; first review of the film in Berlin considered the scenario to be weak and felt that the artistic work had been wasted on the manufactured story although did acknowledge that nothing had been filmed like it before and its effect was positively overwhelming and that there were some exceptional performances. Critic Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;technical marvel with feet of clay&quot;. A review by H. G. Wells dated 17 April 1927 accused it of &quot;foolishness, cliché, platitude, and muddlement about mechanical progress and progress in general&quot;. He faulted &quot;Metropolis&quot; for its premise that automation created drudgery rather than relieving it, wondered who was buying the machines&#x27; output if not the workers, and found parts of the story derivative of Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, Karel Čapek&#x27;s &quot;R.U.R.&quot;, and his own &quot;The Sleeper Awakes&quot;. Wells called &quot;Metropolis&quot; &quot;quite the silliest film&quot;, but the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; called it &quot;a weird and fascinating picture&quot;.

In &quot;The New Yorker&quot; Oliver Claxton called &quot;Metropolis&quot; &quot;unconvincing and overlong&quot;, faulting much of the plot as &quot;laid on with a terrible Teutonic heaviness, and an unnecessary amount of philosophizing in the beginning&quot; that made the film &quot;as soulless as the city of its tale&quot;. He also called the acting &quot;uninspired with the exception of Brigitte Helm&quot;. Nevertheless, Claxton wrote that &quot;the setting, the use of people and their movement, and various bits of action stand out as extraordinary and make it nearly an obligatory picture.&quot; Other critics considered the film a remarkable achievement that surpassed even its high expectations, praising its visual splendour and ambitious production values.

A month after their first review, &quot;Variety&quot; founder Sime Silverman reviewed the film in New York and considered the film to have mass appeal but called it &quot;a weird story, visionary all of the time, without any degree of unusual imagination and offtimes monotonous&quot;.

Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels was impressed with the film&#x27;s message of social justice. In a 1928 speech, he said, &quot;the political bourgeoisie is about to leave the stage of history. In its place advance the oppressed producers of the head and hand, the forces of Labor, to begin their historical mission&quot;. Shortly after the Nazis came to power, Goebbels told Lang that, on the basis of their seeing &quot;Metropolis&quot; together years before, Hitler had said that he wanted Lang to make Nazi films.

German cultural critic Siegfried Kracauer later wrote of &quot;Metropolis&quot;, &quot;The Americans relished its technical excellence; the English remained aloof; the French were stirred by a film which seemed to them a blend of [composer] Wagner and [armaments manufacturer] Krupp, and on the whole an alarming sign of Germany&#x27;s vitality.&quot;

Lang later expressed dissatisfaction with the film. In an interview with Peter Bogdanovich in &quot;Who the Devil Made It: Conversations with Legendary Film Directors&quot;, published in 1998, he expressed his reservations:

In his profile of Lang, which introduced the interview, Bogdanovich suggested that Lang&#x27;s distaste for his film also stemmed from the Nazi Party&#x27;s fascination with it. Von Harbou became a member of the Party in 1933. She and Lang divorced the following year. Lang later moved to the United States to escape the Nazis, while Harbou stayed in Germany and continued to write state-approved films.

===Later acclaim===
According to Roger Ebert, &quot;&quot;Metropolis&quot; is one of the great achievements of the silent era, a work so audacious in its vision and so angry in its message that it is, if anything, more powerful today than when it was made.&quot; Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Movie Guide&#x27;s entry on the film reads, &quot;Heavy going at times but startling set design and special effects command attention throughout.&quot;

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;Metropolis&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;It&#x27;s a measure of the sheer power of Lang&#x27;s vision that it survives this heavy-handed cosmetic modernizing quite intact. Inspired by his first sight of Manhattan, Metropolis is a dark dream of the city of 2026, where the idle rich live in penthouses and play in rooftop pleasure gardens while the faceless workers toil in the machine caverns far, far below.&quot;

The film has an approval rating of 97% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 126 reviews, with an average rating of 9.1/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A visually awe-inspiring science fiction classic from the silent era.&quot; In Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 98 out of 100 based on 14 critics, Indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. It also ranked 12th in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema&quot; in 2010. The 2002 version was awarded the New York Film Critics Circle Awards &quot;Special Award&quot; for the restoration. In 2012, in correspondence with the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; Poll, the British Film Institute called &quot;Metropolis&quot; the 35th-greatest film of all time. In the 2022 version of the poll, &quot;Metropolis&quot; fell slightly to 67th place.

Lane Roth in &quot;Film Quarterly&quot; called it a &quot;seminal film&quot; because of its concerns with &quot;profound impact technological progress has on man&#x27;s social and spiritual progress&quot; and concluded that &quot;ascendancy of artifact over nature is depicted not as liberating man, but as subjugating and corrupting him&quot;. Martin Scorsese included it on a list of &quot;39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker.&quot;

Exploring the dramatic production background and historical importance of the film&#x27;s complex political context in &quot;The American Conservative&quot;, film historian Cristobal Catalan suggests &quot;Metropolis is a passionate call, and equally a passionate caution, for social change&quot;. Peter Bradshaw noted that the &quot;Maschinenmensch&quot; based on Maria is &quot;a brilliant eroticisation and fetishisation of modern technology&quot;.

The film was included by the Vatican in a list of important films compiled in 1995, under the category of &quot;Art&quot;.

==Restorations==

The original premiere cut of &quot;Metropolis&quot; has been lost, and for decades the film could be seen only in heavily truncated edits that lacked nearly a quarter of the original length. But over the years, various elements of footage have been rediscovered. This was the case even though cinematographer Karl Freund followed the usual practice of the time of securing three printable takes of each shot in order to create three camera negatives which could be edited for striking prints. Two of these negatives were destroyed when Paramount reedited the film for the US market and the UK market. UFA itself cut the third negative for the August 1927 release.

=== East German version (1972) ===
Between 1968 and 1972, the Staatliches Filmarchiv der DDR, with the help of film archives from around the world, put together a version of &quot;Metropolis&quot; which restored some scenes and footage, but the effort was hobbled by a lack of a guide, such as an original script, to determine what, exactly, was in the original version.

=== Giorgio Moroder version (1984) ===
In 1984, a new restoration and edit of the film, running 83 minutes, was made by Italian music producer Giorgio Moroder, who paid $200,000 for the rights, outbidding his &quot;Cat People&quot; collaborator David Bowie. Although Moroder initially intended only to create a new soundtrack, he was surprised by the lack of a definitive print, and expanded his project to a major reconstruction. Moroder&#x27;s version, which was made in consultation with the Munich Film Archive and their archivist, Enno Patalas, was tinted to emphasise the different moods and locations in the film. It also featured additional special effects, replaced intertitles of character dialogue with subtitles and incorporated a soundtrack featuring songs Moroder composed, produced and recorded with popular artists such as Freddie Mercury, Bonnie Tyler, Pat Benatar, Adam Ant and Jon Anderson. It was the first serious attempt made at restoring &quot;Metropolis&quot; to Lang&#x27;s original vision, and until the restorations in 2001 and 2010, it was the most complete version of the film commercially available. The shorter run time was due to the extensive use of subtitles for spoken lines instead of title cards, a faster frame rate than the original, and the fact that large amounts of footage were still missing at the time.

Moroder&#x27;s version of &quot;Metropolis&quot; generally received poor reviews. Moroder responded to the critics who lambasted his production for not being faithful to the original in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;I didn&#x27;t touch the original because there is no original.&quot; The film was nominated for two Raspberry Awards, Worst Original Song for Mercury’s &quot;Love Kills&quot; and Worst Musical Score for Moroder. However, Bonnie Tyler was nominated for Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance at the 27th Grammy Awards for &quot;Here She Comes&quot;.

In August 2011, after years of the Moroder version being unavailable on video in any format due to music licensing problems, it was announced that Kino International had managed to resolve the situation, and the film was to be released on Blu-ray and DVD in November. In addition, the film enjoyed a limited theatrical re-release.

In 2012, the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films gave &quot;Giorgio Moroder Presents Metropolis&quot; a Saturn Award for Best DVD/Blu-Ray Special Edition Release.

=== Munich Archive version (1987) ===
The moderate commercial success of the Moroder version inspired Enno Patalas, the archivist of the Munich Film Archive, to make an exhaustive attempt to restore the movie in 1986. Starting from the version in the Museum of Modern Art collection, this version took advantage of new acquisitions and newly discovered German censorship records of the original inter-titles, as well as the musical score and other materials from the estate of composer Gottfried Huppertz. The Munich restoration also utilized newly rediscovered still photographs to represent scenes that were still missing from the film. The Munich version was 9,840 feet, or 109 minutes long.

=== &quot;Restored Authorized Edition&quot; (2001) ===
In 1998, Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung commissioned film preservationist Martin Koerber to create a &quot;definitive&quot; restoration of &quot;Metropolis&quot; by expanding on the Munich version. Previously unknown sections of the film were discovered in film museums and archives around the world, including a nitrate original camera negative from the Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv, as well as nitrate prints from the George Eastman House, the British Film Institute and the Cineteca Italiana. These original film elements, digitally cleaned and repaired to remove defects, were used to assemble the film. Newly written intertitles were used to explain missing scenes.

The 2001 restoration premiered on 15 February 2001 at the Berlin Film Festival, with a new score by Bernd Schultheis, performed live by the Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin. For theatrical and DVD release, it featured a new recording of Huppertz&#x27;s original score performed by a 65-piece orchestra. The running time is 124 minutes at 24 fps, and it was released internationally on various DVD editions beginning in 2003.

=== &quot;The Complete Metropolis&quot; (2010) ===
On 1 July 2008, film experts in Berlin announced that a 16 mm reduction negative of the original cut had been discovered in the archives of the Museo del Cine in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The negative was a safety reduction made in the 1960s or 1970s from a 35 mm positive of Lang&#x27;s original version, which an Argentinian film distributor had obtained in advance of arranging theatrical engagements in South America. The safety reduction was intended to safeguard the contents in case the original&#x27;s flammable nitrate film stock was destroyed. The negative was passed to a private collector, an art foundation and finally the Museo del Cine.

The print was investigated by the Argentinian film collector/historian and TV presenter Fernando Martín Peña, along with Paula Felix-Didier, the head of the museum, after Peña heard an anecdote from a cinema club manager expressing surprise at the length of a print of &quot;Metropolis&quot; he had viewed. The print was indeed Lang&#x27;s full original, with about 25 minutes of footage, around one-fifth of the film, that had not been seen since 1927.

Under the auspices of the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung, Berlin&#x27;s Deutsche Kinemathek and Museo del Cine, a group of experts, including Anke Wilkening, Martin Koerber, and Frank Strobel began combining the newly discovered footage with the existing footage from the 2001 restoration. A major problem was that the Argentinian footage was in poor condition and had many scratches, streaks, and changes in brightness. The group was able to repair some of this damage using digital technology that had not yet been developed in 2001. The reconstruction of the film with the new footage was once again accompanied by the original music score, including Huppertz&#x27;s handwritten notes, which acted as the key resource in determining the places in which the restored footage would go. Since the Argentinian print was a complete version of the original, some scenes from the 2001 restoration were put in different places than previously, and the tempo of the original editing was restored.

In 2005, Australian historian and politician Michael Organ had examined a print of the film in the National Film Archive of New Zealand. Organ discovered that the print contained scenes missing from other copies of the film. After hearing of the discovery of the Argentine print of the film and the restoration project, Organ contacted the German restorers; the New Zealand print contained 11 missing scenes and featured some brief pieces of footage that were used to restore damaged sections of the Argentine print. It is believed that the New Zealand and Argentine prints were all sourced from the same master. The newly discovered footage was used in the restoration project. The Argentine print was in poor condition and required considerable restoration before it was re-premiered in February 2010. Two short sequences, depicting a monk preaching and a fight between Rotwang and Fredersen, were damaged beyond repair. Title cards describing the action were inserted by the restorers to compensate. The Argentine print revealed new scenes that enriched the film&#x27;s narrative complexity. The characters of Josaphat, the Thin Man, and 11811 appear throughout the film and the character Hel is reintroduced.

The 2010 restoration was premiered on 12 February 2010 at the Berlin Friedrichstadtpalast. Huppertz&#x27;s score was performed by the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Frank Strobel, who also re-recorded it for theatrical and home video release. The performance was a gala screening as part of the 60th Berlinale and had several simultaneous screenings. It was also shown on an outdoor screen at Berlin&#x27;s Brandenburg Gate, as well as at the Alte Oper in Frankfurt am Main. The Brandenburg Gate screening was also telecast live by the Arte network. The North American premiere took place at the 2010 TCM Classic Film Festival in Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on 25 April 2010.

The restoration has a running time of 148 minutes (or nearly 2.5 hours) and was released internationally on various DVD and Blu-ray editions beginning in 2010.

==Copyright status==
The American copyright for &quot;Metropolis&quot; lapsed in 1953, which later led to a proliferation of versions being released on video. Along with other foreign-made works, the film&#x27;s U.S. copyright was restored in 1996 by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act; the constitutionality of this copyright extension was challenged, but was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2012&#x27;s &quot;Golan v. Holder&quot;. This had the effect of restoring the copyright in the work as of 1 January 1996. 

Under current U.S. copyright law, &quot;Metropolis&quot; entered the public domain on 1 January 2023; the U.S. copyright limit for films of its age is 95 years from publication per the Copyright Term Extension Act.

Under current EU copyright law, the film will remain under copyright in Germany and the rest of the European Union until the end of 2046, 70 years after Fritz Lang&#x27;s death.

==Adaptations==
* A 1989 musical theatre adaptation, &quot;Metropolis&quot;, was performed on the West End in London and in Chicago. The play&#x27;s music was written by Joe Brooks and the lyrics by Dusty Hughes.
* In December 2007, it was announced that producer Thomas Schühly (&quot;Alexander&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot;) had obtained the remake rights to &quot;Metropolis&quot;.
* In December 2016, it was announced that Sam Esmail would adapt the film into a television miniseries. In March 2022, Apple TV+ gave the production a series order, with Esmail writing and directing the series and also serving as showrunner. In February 2023, it was reported that Briana Middleton was cast in the lead role. In June 2023, the producers Universal Content Productions stated that the series would not be moving forward due to the WGA strike and rising development costs.
* The &quot;Metropolis&quot; manga, sometimes referred to as &quot;Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s Metropolis&quot; or &quot;Robotic Angel&quot;, has parallels with the film. Mangaka Osamu Tezuka has said that he saw a single still image of the movie in a magazine at the time of creating his manga. The manga has been adapted into a 2001 anime feature film of the same name. The adaptation incorporated more elements of the 1927 film.

==In popular culture==

Following are mentions of the film in popular culture:
* The cover of 1970s British rock band Be Bop Deluxe&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;Live! In the Air Age&quot; is a still from the film.
* David Bowie&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; and its following tour were inspired by the film, with Amanda Lear recalling &quot;He rented the film and ran it over and over again in his house. And that&#x27;s where &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; came from – the whole staging and album and everything, Bowie got from &quot;Metropolis&quot;&quot;.
* The German electronic group Kraftwerk&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;The Man-Machine&quot; contains the song &quot;Metropolis&quot;.

* The music video for Queen&#x27;s 1984 song &quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot; uses imagery and clips from the movie. The four members of the band are inserted into clips, for example the face of Freddie Mercury is briefly superimposed over the robot&#x27;s face. The video ends with the caption &quot;Thanks to Metropolis&quot;. Mercury also contributed the song &quot;Love Kills&quot; to the soundtrack of the Moroder version of the film, for which he received a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Original Song.

* Janelle Monáe based both her concept albums on the original film, including her EP, &quot;&quot;, released in mid-2007, and &quot;The ArchAndroid&quot;, released in 2009. The latter also included an homage to &quot;Metropolis&quot; on its cover, with the film version of the Tower of Babel among the remainder of the city. The albums follow the adventures of Monáe&#x27;s alter-ego and robot, Cindi Mayweather, as a messianic figure to the android community of &quot;Metropolis&quot;.
* Videos for songs by pop singer-songwriter Lady Gaga have made a series of references to Lang&#x27;s film. Visual allusions to the film are noted most predominantly in the music videos for &quot;Alejandro&quot; (2010), &quot;Born This Way&quot; (2011), and &quot;Applause&quot; (2013).
* The 2012 EP &quot;Metropolis Part I&quot; by the electronic music trio The M Machine is a conceptual work inspired by the film.
* The Brazilian metal band Sepultura named their 2013 album &quot;The Mediator Between Head and Hands Must Be the Heart&quot; after a quote from the film.

<text>Sussex (; from the Old English &quot;Sūþseaxe&quot;; lit. &#x27;South Saxons&#x27;; &#x27;Sussex&#x27;) is an area within South East England that was historically a kingdom and, later, a county. It includes the ceremonial counties of East Sussex and West Sussex.

The area borders the English Channel to the south, and the ceremonial counties of Surrey to the north, Kent to the north-east, and Hampshire to the west. Sussex contains the city of Brighton and Hove and its wider city region, as well as the South Downs National Park and the National Landscapes of the High Weald and Chichester Harbour. Its coastline is long.

The Kingdom of Sussex emerged in the fifth century in the area that had previously been inhabited by the Regni tribe in the Romano-British period. In about 827, shortly after the Battle of Ellendun, Sussex was conquered by Wessex. From 860 it was ruled by the kings of Wessex, and in 927 it became part of the Kingdom of England. By the Norman period, Sussex was subdivided into six administrative districts known as rapes, which were themselves divided into hundreds. By the sixteenth century, the eastern three rapes and the western three rapes had been combined for most meetings of the court of quarter sessions, a division which was reinforced when the administrative counties of East Sussex and West Sussex were established in 1889. Subsequent local government reforms maintained the division into east and west. The county retained a single lord lieutenant and sheriff until 1974, when they were replaced with separate posts for East and West Sussex and Sussex lost its status as a ceremonial county.

Sussex is widely regarded as a single unified entity for some purposes, including provision of some public services, food and drink and sport. In 2007, Sussex Day was created to celebrate the county&#x27;s culture and history.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Sussex&quot; is derived from the Middle English , which is in turn derived from the Old English , meaning &quot;(land or people) of the South Saxons&quot; (cf. Essex, Middlesex and Wessex). The South Saxons were a Germanic tribe that settled in the region from the North German Plain during the fifth and sixth centuries.

The earliest-known usage of the term South Saxons (Latin: ) is in a royal charter of 689 which names them and their king, Noðhelm, although the term may well have been in use for some time before that. The monastic chronicler who wrote up the entry classifying the invasion seems to have got his dates wrong; recent scholars have suggested he might have been a quarter of a century too late.

In the Domesday Book of 1086, Sussex is recorded as &quot;Sudsexe&quot;.

Three United States counties (in Delaware, New Jersey and Virginia), and a former county/land division of Western Australia, are named after Sussex.

==Symbols==

The flag of Sussex consists of six gold martlets, or heraldic swallows, on a blue background, blazoned as &quot;Azure, six martlets or&quot;. Recognised by the Flag Institute on 20 May 2011, its design is based on the heraldic shield of Sussex. The first-known recording of this emblem being used to represent the county was in 1611 when cartographer John Speed deployed it to represent the Kingdom of the South Saxons. However, it seems that Speed was repeating an earlier association between the emblem and the county, rather than being the inventor of the association. It is now firmly regarded that the county emblem originated and derived from the coat of arms of the 14th-century Knight of the Shire, Sir John de Radynden. Sussex&#x27;s six martlets are today held to symbolise the traditional six sub-divisions of the county known as &quot;rapes&quot;.

&quot;Sussex by the Sea&quot; is regarded as the unofficial anthem of Sussex; it was composed by William Ward-Higgs in 1907, perhaps originally from the lyrics of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s poem entitled &quot;Sussex&quot;. Adopted by the Royal Sussex Regiment and popularised in World War I, it is sung at celebrations across the county, including those at Lewes Bonfire, and at sports matches, including those of Brighton and Hove Albion Football Club and Sussex County Cricket Club.

The county day, called Sussex Day, is celebrated annually on 16 June, the feast day of St Richard of Chichester, Sussex&#x27;s patron saint, whose shrine at Chichester Cathedral was an important place of pilgrimage in the Middle Ages.

Sussex&#x27;s motto, &quot;We wunt be druv&quot;, is a Sussex dialect expression meaning &quot;we will not be pushed around&quot; and reflects the traditionally independent nature of Sussex men and women. The round-headed rampion, also known as the &quot;Pride of Sussex&quot;, was adopted as Sussex&#x27;s county flower in 2002.

==Geography==

===Landscape===
The physical geography of Sussex relies heavily on its lying on the southern part of the Wealden anticline, the major features of which are the high lands that cross the county in a west to east direction: the Weald itself and the South Downs. Natural England has identified the following seven national character areas in Sussex:

* South Coast Plain
* South Downs
* Wealden Greensand
* Low Weald
* High Weald
* Pevensey Levels
* Romney Marshes

At , Blackdown is the highest point in Sussex, or county top. With a height of Ditchling Beacon is the highest point in East Sussex. At long, the River Medway is the longest river flowing through Sussex. The longest river entirely in Sussex is the River Arun, which is long. Sussex&#x27;s largest lakes are man-made reservoirs. The largest is Bewl Water on the Kent border, while the largest wholly within Sussex is Ardingly Reservoir.

===Climate===
The coastal resorts of Sussex and neighbouring Hampshire are the sunniest places in the United Kingdom. The coast has consistently more sunshine than the inland areas: sea breezes, blowing off the sea, tend to clear any cloud from the coast. The sunshine average is approximately 1,900 hours a year; this is much higher than the UK average of 1,340 hours a year. Most of Sussex lies in hardiness zone 8; the exception is the coastal plain west of Brighton, which lies in the milder zone 9.

Rainfall is below average with the heaviest precipitation on the South Downs with of rainfall per year. The close proximity of Sussex to the Continent of Europe, results in cold spells in winter and hot, humid weather in summer.

The climate of the coastal districts is strongly influenced by the sea, which, because of its tendency to warm up slower than land, can result in cooler temperatures than inland in the summer. In the autumn months, the coast sometimes has higher temperatures. Rainfall during the summer months is mainly from thunderstorms and thundery showers; from January to March the heavier rainfall is due to prevailing south-westerly frontal systems.

In winter, the east winds can be as cold as further inland. Selsey is known as a tornado hotspot, with small tornadoes hitting the town in 1986, 1998 and 2000, with the 1998 tornado causing an estimated £10 million of damage to 1,000 buildings.

===Conurbations===
Most of Sussex&#x27;s population is distributed in an east–west line along the English Channel coast or on the east–west line of the A272. The exception to this pattern is the 20th-century north–south development on the A23-Brighton line corridor, Sussex&#x27;s main link to London. Sussex&#x27;s population is dominated by the Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation that, with a population of more than 470,000, is home to almost 1 in 3 of Sussex&#x27;s population. According to the ONS urban area populations for continuous built-up areas, these are the five largest conurbations:
==Population==
The combined population of Sussex as of 2021 was about 1.7 million. In 2021, Sussex had a population density of 451 per km2, higher than the average for England of 434 per km2.

*The earliest statement as to the population of Sussex is made by Bede, who describes the county in the year 681 as containing land for 7,000 families; allowing ten to a family (a reasonable estimate at that date), the total population would be 70,000.
*In 1693 the county is said to have contained 21,537 houses.
*The 1801 census found that the population was 159,311.
The decline of the Sussex ironworks probably accounts for the small increase in population during several centuries, although after the Massacre of St Bartholomew upwards of 1,500 Huguenots landed at Rye, and in 1685, after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, many more refugees were added to the county. The population of Sussex was 550,446 in 1891 and 605,202 in 1901.

==History==
===Beginnings===

Finds at Eartham Pit in Boxgrove show that the area has some of the earliest hominid remains in Europe, dating back some 500,000 years and known as Boxgrove Man or &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;. At a site near Pulborough called The Beedings, tools have been found that date from around 35,000 years ago and that are thought to be from either the last Neanderthals in northern Europe or pioneer populations of modern humans. The thriving population lived by hunting game such as horses, bison, mammoths and woolly rhinos. Around 6000 BC, the ice sheet over the North Sea melted, sea levels rose and the meltwaters burst south and westwards, creating the English Channel and cutting the people of Sussex off from their Mesolithic kinsmen to the south. Later in the Neolithic period, the area of the South Downs above Worthing was one of Britain&#x27;s largest and most important flint-mining centres. The flints were used to help fell trees for agriculture. The oldest of these mines, at Church Hill in Findon, has been carbon-dated to 4500 BC to 3750 BC, making it one of the earliest known mines in Britain. Flint tools from Cissbury have been found as far away as the eastern Mediterranean.

Sussex is rich in remains from the Bronze and Iron Ages, in particular the Bronze Age barrows known as the Devil&#x27;s Jumps and Cissbury Ring, one of Britain&#x27;s largest hillforts. Towards the end of the Iron Age in 75 BC people from the Atrebates, one of the tribes of the Belgae, a mix of Celtic and German stock, invaded and occupied southern Britain. This was followed by an invasion by the Roman army under Julius Caesar that temporarily occupied south-eastern Britain in 55 BC.
Soon after the first Roman invasion had ended, the Celtic Regni tribe under their leader Commius initially occupied the Manhood Peninsula. Eppillus, Verica and Cogidubnus followed Commius as rulers of the Regni or southern Atrebates, a region which included most of Sussex, with their capital in the Selsey area.

===Roman canton===
A number of archaeologists now think there is a strong possibility that the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43 started around Fishbourne and Chichester Harbour rather than the traditional landing place of Richborough in Kent. According to this theory, the Romans were called to restore the refugee Verica, a king whose capital was in the Selsey and Chichester area, who had been driven out by the Catuvellauni, a tribe based around modern Hertfordshire.

Much of Sussex was a Roman canton of the Regni, probably taking a similar area to the pre-Roman tribal area and kingdom. Its capital was at Noviomagus Reginorum, modern-day Chichester, close to the pre-Roman capital of the area, around Selsey. Sussex was home to the magnificent Roman Palace at Fishbourne, by far the largest Roman residence known north of the Alps. The Romans built villas, especially on the coastal plain and around Chichester, one of the best preserved being that at Bignor. Christianity first came to Sussex at this time, but faded away when the Romans left in the fifth century. The nationally important Patching hoard of Roman coins that was found in 1997 is the latest find of Roman coins found in Britain, probably deposited after 475 AD, well after the Roman departure from Britain around 410 AD.

===Kingdom of Sussex===


The foundation legend of Sussex is provided by the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, which states that in the year AD 477 Ælle landed with his three sons. Having fought on the banks of the Mearcredesburna, it seems Ælle secured the area between the Ouse and Cuckmere in a treaty. Traditionally this is thought to have been against native Britons, but it may have been to secure the area east of the Saxon Shore fort of Anderida from the influence of the Kingdom of Kent, with whom the South Saxons may have had occasional disputes. Ælle was recognised as the first &#x27;Bretwalda&#x27; or overlord of southern Britain. He was probably the most senior of the Anglo-Saxon kings and led the ill-fated campaign against King Arthur at Mount Badon.

By the seventh century, South Saxon kings were ruling from sites around Selsey (the pre-Roman capital of the area) and Chichester (the Roman capital of the area) initially with similar borders to the pre-Roman kingdom and Roman canton. For much of the 7th and 8th centuries, Sussex suffered attempts at invasion from the Kingdom of Wessex to its west. King Æðelwealh formed an alliance with Christian Mercia against Wessex, becoming Sussex&#x27;s first Christian king. With support from St Wilfrid, Sussex became the last major Anglo Saxon kingdom to become Christian. South Saxon and Mercian forces took control of what is now east Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Cædwalla of Wessex killed Æðelwealh and &quot;ravaged Sussex by fierce slaughter and devastation&quot;. The South Saxons forced Cædwalla from Sussex and were able to lead a campaign into Kent, replacing its king. At this time Sussex could have re-emerged into a regional power. Shortly afterwards, Cædwalla returned to Sussex, killing its king and oppressing its people, putting them in what Bede called &quot;a worse state of slavery&quot;. The South Saxon clergy were put under the control of West Saxon Winchester. Only around 715 was Eadberht of Selsey made the first bishop of the South Saxons, after which further invasion attempts from Wessex ensued.

Following a period of rule by King Offa of Mercia, Sussex regained its independence but was annexed by Wessex around 827 and was fully absorbed into the crown of Wessex in 860, which later grew into the Kingdom of England.

===Norman Sussex===

The Battle of Hastings was fought in Sussex, the victory that led to the Norman conquest of England. In September 1066, William of Normandy landed with his forces at Pevensey and erected a wooden castle at Hastings, from which they raided the surrounding area. The battle was fought between Duke William of Normandy and the English king, Harold Godwinson, who had strong connections with Sussex and whose chief seat was probably in Bosham. After having marched his exhausted army from Yorkshire, Harold fought the Normans at the Battle of Hastings, where England&#x27;s army was defeated and Harold was killed. It is likely that all the fighting men of Sussex were at the battle, as the county&#x27;s thegns were decimated and any that survived had their lands confiscated. William built Battle Abbey at the site of the battle, with the exact spot where Harold fell marked by the high altar.

Sussex experienced some of the greatest changes of any English county under the Normans, for it was the heartland of King Harold and was potentially vulnerable to further invasion. In the immediate aftermath of the Normans&#x27; landing at Pevensey and the Battle of Hastings and to put an end to any rebellion, the Norman army destroyed estates and other assets on their route through Sussex, leading to a 40 per cent reduction in Sussex&#x27;s wealth, a situation worse than any other southern or midland county. By 1086 wealth in Sussex was still 10 to 25 per cent lower than it had been in 1066.

It was also during the Norman period that Sussex achieved its greatest importance in comparison with other English counties. Sussex was on the main route between England and Normandy, and the lands of the Anglo-Norman nobility in what is now western France. The growth in Sussex&#x27;s population, the importance of its ports and the increased colonisation of the Weald were all part of changes as significant to Sussex as those brought by the neolithic period, by the Romans and the Saxons. Sussex also experienced the most radical and thorough reorganisation of land in England. The county&#x27;s existing sub-divisions, known as rapes, were made into castleries and each territory was given to one of William&#x27;s most trusted barons. Castles were built to defend the territories including at Arundel, Bramber, Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings. Sussex&#x27;s bishop, Æthelric II, was deposed and imprisoned and replaced with William the Conqueror&#x27;s personal chaplain, Stigand. The Normans also built Chichester Cathedral and moved the seat of Sussex&#x27;s bishopric from Selsey to Chichester. The Normans also founded new towns in Sussex, including New Shoreham (the centre of modern Shoreham-by-Sea), Battle, Arundel, Uckfield and Winchelsea.

===Sussex under the Plantagenets===
In 1264, the Sussex Downs were the location of the Battle of Lewes, in which Simon de Montfort and his fellow barons captured Prince Edward (later Edward I), the son and heir of Henry III. The subsequent treaty, known as the Mise of Lewes, led to Montfort summoning the first parliament in English history without any prior royal authorisation. A provisional administration was set up, consisting of Montfort, the Bishop of Chichester and the Earl of Gloucester. These three were to elect a council of nine, to govern until a permanent settlement could be reached.
During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Sussex found itself on the frontline, convenient both for intended invasions and retaliatory expeditions by licensed French pirates. Hastings, Rye and Winchelsea were all burnt during this period and all three towns became part of the Cinque Ports, a loose federation for supplying ships for the country&#x27;s security. Also at this time, Amberley and Bodiam castles were built to defend the upper reaches of navigable rivers.
One of the impacts of the war and the Black Death, which killed around half of the population of Sussex, was the perceived injustice that led many Sussex people to participate in the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381. Coastal areas suffered most from the Black Death, and took longest to recover. Instead much economic activity in Sussex was focused on the Weald. Merchants moved north from the coastal towns and many Continental craftsmen, fleeing religious persecution, brought their expertise to the timber, iron, clothmaking and glass industries. Economic and social tensions continued for many years as Sussex people were also involved in Jack Cade&#x27;s rebellion of 1450, in which Cade may have been killed at Cade Street, near Heathfield. Demands grew more radical in Sussex in 1451 when John and William Merfold advocated rule by common people. They also demanded that Henry VI be deposed and publicly incited the killing of the nobility and clergy.

===Early modern Sussex===
The Wealden iron industry expanded rapidly, especially after the first blast furnace arrived in Sussex in 1496, from the Low Countries, which greatly improved efficiency. Skilled Flemish workers moved to Sussex, followed again by Huguenot craftsmen from France, who brought new techniques. The industry was strategically important and flourished into the 17th century, after which it began to decline. It also brought widespread deforestation of parts of the Sussex Weald.

Henry VIII&#x27;s separation of the Church of England from Rome and the dissolution of the monasteries led to the demolition of Lewes Priory and Battle Abbey and the sites being given to Henry&#x27;s supporters. The shrine to St Richard at Chichester Cathedral was also destroyed. Mary I returned England to Catholicism and in Sussex 41 Protestants were burned to death. Under Elizabeth I, religious intolerance continued albeit on a lesser scale, with several people being executed for their Catholic beliefs. In Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, Sussex was open to the older Protestant forms practised in the Weald as well as the newer Protestant forms coming from Continental Europe; combined with a significant Catholic presence, Sussex was in many ways out of step with the rest of southern England.

Sussex escaped the worst ravages of the English Civil War, although control of the Wealden iron industry was strategically important to both sides. In 1642 there was a skirmish at Haywards Heath when Royalists marching towards Lewes were intercepted by local Parliamentarians. The Royalists were routed with around 200 killed or taken prisoner. Shortly after there were sieges at Chichester and Arundel, and a smaller battle at Bramber Bridge. Despite its being under Parliamentarian control, Charles II was able to journey through the county after the Battle of Worcester in 1651 to make his escape to France from the port of Shoreham.

In 1681 Charles II granted William Penn lands in what became Pennsylvania and Delaware. Amongst those whom he carried to North America as colonists were 200 people from Sussex, mostly Quakers, who founded settlements named after places in Sussex including Lewes and Seaford in Sussex County, Delaware and Horsham Township and Chichester in Pennsylvania.

The Sussex coast was greatly modified by the social movement of sea bathing for health which became fashionable among the wealthy in the second half of the 18th century. Resorts developed all along the coast, including at Brighton, Hastings, Worthing, and Bognor.

===Late modern and contemporary Sussex===
Poverty increased and by 1801 Sussex had the highest poor law rates in England, with 23 per cent of its population (37,000 people out of 160,000) living on the breadline and receiving regular relief. Socially acceptable crimes, including protest, riot, collective action and smuggling were commonplace in Sussex and were seen by many as a legitimate way to address grievances and assert freedoms. At this time, Sussex became a centre for radicalism. Thomas Paine developed his political ideas in Lewes, and later wrote &quot;Common Sense&quot; which was influential in the American Revolution. Known as &#x27;the radical duke&#x27;, Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond, was an early supporter of parliamentary reform and US independence. Richard Cobden was a product of Sussex&#x27;s rural radicalism, and became a campaigner for free trade and peace. Poet Percy Bysshe Shelley was another influential radical from Sussex.

At the beginning of the 19th century agricultural labourers&#x27; conditions took a turn for the worse with an increasing amount of them becoming unemployed, those in work faced their wages being forced down. Conditions became so bad that it was even reported to the House of Lords in 1830 that four harvest labourers (seasonal workers) had been found dead of starvation. The deteriorating conditions of work for the agricultural labourer eventually triggered riots, first in neighbouring Kent, and then in Sussex, where they lasted for several weeks, although the unrest continued until 1832 and became known as the Swing Riots.

During World War I, on 30 June 1916, the Royal Sussex Regiment took part in the Battle of the Boar&#x27;s Head at Richebourg-l&#x27;Avoué. The day subsequently became known as The Day Sussex Died. Within five hours the 17 officers and 349 men were killed, and 1,000 men were wounded or taken prisoner. In 1918 the terms of the armistice to be offered to Germany at the end of World War I were agreed at a meeting at Danny House, Hurstpierpoint. With the declaration of World War II, Sussex found itself part of the country&#x27;s frontline with its airfields playing a key role in the Battle of Britain and with its towns being some of the most frequently bombed. Sussex was garrisoned by multiple British and Canadian Army units from 1940 until at least May 1942. During the lead up to the Dieppe Raid and D-Day landings, the people of Sussex were witness to the buildup of military personnel and materials, including the assembly of landing crafts and construction of Mulberry harbours off the county&#x27;s coast.

In the post-war era, the New Towns Act 1946 designated Crawley as the site of a new town. As part of the Local Government Act 1972, the eastern and western divisions of Sussex were made into the ceremonial counties of East and West Sussex in 1974. Boundaries were changed and a large part of the rape of Lewes was transferred from the eastern division into West Sussex, along with Gatwick Airport, historically part of the county of Surrey.

==Governance==
===Politics===
In February 2025, Government ministers approved proposals under the English Devolution Bill to create a mayoral strategic authority for Sussex. Devolved areas of responsibility would include transport, public safety, health, the environment and climate change, housing, economic growth, skills and jobs. Under these proposals, the people of Sussex could directly elect a Mayor of Sussex and Brighton to oversee the strategic authority as soon as May 2026. The strategic authority would also see the abolition of the Greater Brighton City Region and all of the existing local authorities in Sussex, to be replaced by at least three unitary authorities, to be based significantly on the areas currently covered by East Sussex County Council, West Sussex County Council and Brighton and Hove City Council. The post of Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner would also be abolished under the proposals.

Amongst top-tier local authorities, East and West Sussex County Councils are both held by the Conservatives and Brighton and Hove City Council is led by Labour. Amongst district councils, as of June 2024, the Lib Dems had a majority in three local authorities (Chichester, Eastbourne and Horsham) and the Labour Party had a majority in three local authorities (Adur, Crawley and Worthing). Of the six local authorities in no overall control, one had a minority Green administration (Hastings), one was run by a Lib Dem-Labour-Green coalition (Arun), one was run by a Green-Labour coalition (Lewes), one as run by a Lib Dem-Independent coalition (Mid Sussex) one was run by an Independent-Labour-Lib Dem-Green coalition (Rother) and one had a Lib Dem-Green coalition (Wealden). Conservative Katy Bourne is the Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner, having first been elected in 2012. 

In the House of Commons, the lower house of the UK Parliament, Sussex is represented by 17 MPs. At the 2024 general election, 6 Labour and Labour Co-op MPs, 5 Conservative MPs, 5 Lib Dem MPs and 1 Green MP were elected from Sussex constituencies.

From 1290, Sussex returned two Members of Parliament to the House of Commons of the Parliament of England. Each county returned two MPs and each borough designated by Royal charter also returned two MPs. After the union with Scotland two members represented the county in the House of Commons of Great Britain from 1707 to 1800 and of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1832. The Reform Act 1832 led to the disenfranchisement of some of the smaller Sussex boroughs and divided what had been a single county constituency into eastern and western divisions, with two representatives elected for each division. The reforms of the 19th century made the electoral system more representative, but it was not until 1928 that there was universal suffrage.

There was a strong radical and republican tradition in Sussex from the 19th century. For most of the 20th century Sussex was a Conservative Party stronghold—from the 1906 to 1997 general elections the only seats in Sussex won by parties other than the Conservatives were in the constituencies of Brighton and Brighton Kemptown. Since 1997 there has been a gradual shift to the left, especially in more urban areas. This has been most notable in Brighton and Hove, where in Brighton Pavilion the UK&#x27;s first Green MP, Caroline Lucas, was elected in 2010 and the UK&#x27;s first Green-led local authority was elected in 2011. 

In the 2016 referendum on UK membership of the EU, the people of Sussex voted to leave the EU by the narrowest of margins, by 50.23% to 49.77% or 4,413 votes.

===Law===
Headquartered in Lewes, Home Office policing in Sussex has been provided by Sussex Police since 1968.

The first-tier Crown Court for all of Sussex is Lewes Crown Court, which has courts in Lewes, Brighton and Hove. Like other first-tier Crown Courts it has its own resident High Court Judge. There is also a third-tier Crown Court at Chichester. The local prison in Sussex for men is Lewes Prison and there is also a Category D prison at Ford.

===Administrative divisions===

====Historic sub-divisions====

A rape is a traditional territorial sub-division of Sussex, formerly used for various administrative purposes. Their origin is unknown, but they appear to predate the Norman Conquest Each rape was split into several hundreds and may be Romano-British or Anglo-Saxon in origin.

At the time of the Norman Conquest, there were four rapes: Arundel, Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings. The rape of Bramber was created later in the 11th century and the rape of Chichester was created in the 13th century.

====Modern local authority areas====
Local government in Sussex has been subject to periodic review over time. Currently, Sussex is currently divided into
* two counties for ceremonial purposes,
*for administrative purposes, into two county council areas (East and West Sussex) and one unitary authority, the city of Brighton and Hove.
There is a two-tier structure for East Sussex and West Sussex with education, social services, libraries, public transport and waste disposal carried out by the county councils and local planning and building control carried out by the district and borough councils.

For the governance of a long narrow territory it became practical to divide the county into two sections. The three eastern rapes of Sussex became east Sussex and the three western rapes became west Sussex. This began in 1504, with separate administrations (Quarter Sessions) for east and west, a situation recognised by the County of Sussex Act 1865. Under the Local Government Act 1888, the two divisions became two administrative counties (along with three county boroughs (Brighton, Hastings and, from 1911, Eastbourne) that were independent of the administrative counties).

==Economy==
Despite its location in the prosperous South East of England, there is considerable economic variation within Sussex. In most areas within Sussex, economic output is close to or significantly lower than the UK average and is far below the average for South East England. For statistical purposes, the UK Government pairs Sussex at the NUTS2 level with Surrey, a significantly better off region, which to some degree masks the level of deprivation in Sussex. In 2018 the four Sussex statistical areas at the NUTS3 level had a GDP per head that varied between £18,852 (58.6% of the UK average) and £33,711 (104.6% of the UK average), and was typically below the UK average of £32,216. This was in contrast to the two areas in Surrey, which had a GDP per head of £37,429 and £42,433, well above the UK average. There is also serious deprivation in Sussex comparable to the most deprived UK inner city areas. Some areas of Sussex are in the top 5 per cent most deprived in the UK and, in some areas, two-thirds of children are living in poverty. In 2011, two Local Enterprise Partnerships were formed to improve the economy in Sussex. These were the Coast to Capital LEP, covering West Sussex, Brighton and Hove and the Lewes district in the west of East Sussex, as well as parts of Surrey and South London; and the South East LEP, which covers the local authority area of East Sussex, as well as Kent and Essex. In the most populous part of Sussex, around the Brighton and Hove Built-up area, the Greater Brighton City Deal was formed to enable the area to fulfil its economic potential, into one of the highest performing urban economies in the UK.

Tourism in Sussex is well established, and includes seaside resorts and the South Downs National Park. Brighton and Hove has a high density of businesses involved in media, particularly digital or &quot;new media&quot;; since the 1990s Brighton has been referred to as &quot;Silicon Beach&quot;. The Greater Brighton City Deal seeks to develop Brighton&#x27;s creative-tech cluster under the name Tech City South. The University of Sussex and the University of Brighton provide employment for many more. A large part of the county, centred on Gatwick Airport has been recognised as a key economic growth area for South East England while reasonable rail connections allow many people to work in London.
Several large companies are based in Sussex including American Express (Brighton), The Body Shop (Littlehampton), Bowers &amp; Wilkins (Worthing), Hastings Insurance and Park Holidays UK (Bexhill), Ricardo plc (Shoreham-by-Sea), Rolls-Royce Motor Cars (Goodwood), Thales UK (Crawley), Alfa Laval (Eastbourne) and Virgin Atlantic (Crawley).

The Sussex Weald had an iron working industry from the Iron Age until the 19th century. The glass making industry started on the Sussex/Surrey border throughout the late medieval period until the 17th century. Agriculture in Sussex depended on the terrain, so in the sticky clays and acid sands of the Sussex Weald, pastoral and mixed farming took place, with sheep farming being common on the chalk downland. Fishing fleets continue to operate along the coast, notably at Rye and Hastings. There are working harbours at Rye, Hastings, Newhaven and Shoreham; while Pagham, Eastbourne and Chichester harbours cater for leisure craft, as does Brighton Marina. The Mid Sussex area had a thriving clay industry in the early 20th century.

==Education==

The oldest university in Sussex is the research intensive University of Sussex, founded in 1961 at Falmer in Brighton, the first new university in England since World War II. The university consistently ranks among the top 20 universities in the UK. It is home to the Institute of Development Studies and the Science Policy Research Unit, alongside more than 40 other established research centres.

In 1992 it was joined by the University of Brighton (with campuses in Brighton, Eastbourne and Hastings) and in 2005 by the University of Chichester (with campuses in Chichester and Bognor Regis). Validated by University of the Arts London, higher education is also provided at Greater Brighton Metropolitan College, whose campuses in Brighton, Worthing and Shoreham-by-Sea are referred to as MET University Centre.

The Prebendal School in Chichester is the oldest known school in Sussex and probably dates to when the Normans moved the Sussex bishopric from Selsey to Chichester Cathedral in the 11th century. Primary and secondary education in the state sector in Sussex is provided by its three local education authorities of East and West Sussex County Councils and Brighton and Hove City Council. Sussex also has some of the best-known independent schools in England including Christ&#x27;s Hospital School, Brighton College, Eastbourne College, Lancing College and Battle Abbey School.

==Healthcare==

The Sussex County Hospital (now the Royal Sussex County Hospital) was founded in 1828 at Brighton while the Sussex County Mental Asylum (later &#x27;St. Francis Hospital&#x27; and now the Princess Royal Hospital) was founded in 1859 in the centre of county at Haywards Heath.
Sussex&#x27;s first medical school, the Brighton and Sussex Medical School, was set up in 2002. In 2011 the four Sussex NHS primary care trusts (PCTs) joined forces to become NHS Sussex. The Major Trauma Centre at the Royal Sussex County Hospital is the Major Trauma Centre for Sussex with the Sussex&#x27;s other hospitals acting as trauma units. It is one of only five major trauma centres across the NHS&#x27;s South of England area. The hospital also houses the Sussex Cancer Centre which serves most of Sussex.

==Culture==

Sussex has a centuries-old reputation for being separate and culturally distinct from the rest of England. The people of Sussex have a reputation for independence of thought and have an aversion to being pushed around, as expressed through the Sussex motto, We wunt be druv. Sussex is known for its strong tradition of bonfire celebrations and its proud musical heritage. Sussex in the first half of the 20th century was a major centre for modernism, and saw many radical artists and writers move to its seaside towns and countryside.

The county is home to the Brighton Festival and the Brighton Fringe, England&#x27;s largest arts festival. Brighton Pride is one of the UK&#x27;s largest and oldest gay pride parades and other pride events take place at most other major towns including Crawley, Eastbourne, Hastings and Worthing. Chichester is home to the Chichester Festival Theatre and Pallant House Gallery.

===Architecture===
Sussex&#x27;s building materials reflect its geology, being made of flint on and near the South Downs and sandstone in the Weald. Brick is used across the county.

Typically conservative and moderate, the architecture of Sussex also has elaborate and eccentric buildings rarely matched elsewhere in England including the Saxon Church of St Mary the Blessed Virgin, Sompting, Castle Goring, which has a front and rear of entirely different styles and Brighton&#x27;s Indo-Saracenic Royal Pavilion.

===Dialect===

Historically, Sussex has had its own dialect with regional differences reflecting its cultural history. It has been divided into variants for the three western rapes of West Sussex, the two eastern rapes of Lewes and Pevensey and an area approximate to the easternmost rape of Hastings. The Sussex dialect is also notable in having an unusually large number of words for mud, in a way similar to the popular belief which exists that the Inuit have an unusually large number of words for snow.

===Literature===
Writers born in Sussex include the Renaissance poet Thomas May and playwrights Thomas Otway, and John Fletcher. One of the most prolific playwrights of his day, Fletcher is thought to have collaborated with Shakespeare. Notable Sussex poets include William Collins, William Hayley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Richard Realf, Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, Edward Carpenter and John Scott. Other writers from Sussex include Sheila Kaye-Smith, Noel Streatfeild, Patrick Hamilton, Rumer Godden, Hammond Innes, Angus Wilson, Maureen Duffy, Angela Carter, William Nicholson, Peter James, Kate Mosse and Alex Preston.

In addition there are writers, who while they were not born in Sussex had a strong connection. This includes Charlotte Turner Smith, William Blake, Alfred Tennyson, H. G. Wells, Hilaire Belloc, John Cowper Powys, Arthur Conan Doyle, Henry James, E. F. Benson, John Roman Baker, James Herbert and AA Milne, who lived in Ashdown Forest for much of his life and set his Winnie-the-Pooh stories in the forest. Sussex has been home to four winners of the Nobel Prize in Literature: Rudyard Kipling spent much of his life in Sussex, living in Rottingdean and later at Burwash. Irishman W. B. Yeats spent three winters living with American poet Ezra Pound at Colemans Hatch in the Ashdown Forest and towards the end of his life spent much time at Steyning and Withyham; John Galsworthy spent much of his life in Bury in the Sussex Downs; and Harold Pinter lived in Worthing in the 1960s.

===Music===

Sussex&#x27;s rich musical heritage encompasses folk, classical and popular genres amongst others. Composed by William Ward-Higgs, &quot;Sussex by the Sea&quot; is the county&#x27;s unofficial anthem. Passed on through oral tradition, many of Sussex&#x27;s traditional songs may not have changed significantly for centuries, with their origins perhaps dating as far back as the time of the South Saxons. William Henry Hudson compared the singing of the Sussexians with that of the Basques and the Tehuelche people of Patagonia, both peoples with ancient cultures. The songs sung by the Copper Family, Henry Burstow, Samuel Willett, Peter and Harriett Verrall, David Penfold and others were collected by John Broadwood and his niece Lucy Broadwood, Kate Lee and composers Ralph Vaughan Williams and George Butterworth. Sussex also played a major part in the folk music revival of the 1960s and 1970s with various singers including George &#x27;Pop&#x27; Maynard, Scan Tester, Tony Wales and the sisters
Dolly and Shirley Collins.

Sussex has also been home to many composers of classical music including Thomas Weelkes, John Ireland, Edward Elgar, Frank Bridge, Sir Hubert Parry and Ralph Vaughan Williams, who played a major part in recording Sussex&#x27;s traditional music. While Glyndebourne is one of the world&#x27;s best known opera houses, the county is home to professional orchestras the Brighton Philharmonic Orchestra and the Worthing Symphony Orchestra.

In popular music, Sussex has produced artists including Leo Sayer, The Cure, The Levellers, Brett Anderson, Keane, The Kooks, The Feeling, Rizzle Kicks, Conor Maynard, Tom Odell, Royal Blood, Rag&#x27;n&#x27;Bone Man, Celeste, Architects and Maisie Peters. In the 1970s, Sussex was home to Phun City, the UK&#x27;s first large-scale free music festival and hosted the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest which propelled ABBA to worldwide fame. Major festivals include The Great Escape Festival and Glyndebourne Festival Opera.

===Television===
Due to the size of the county, it is covered by more than one TV station:

*BBC South East covers Brighton &amp; Hove and East Sussex, and also Haywards Heath, East Grinstead, Burgess Hill and Shoreham-by-Sea in West Sussex.
*BBC South covers the remainder of West Sussex.
*ITV Meridian is another regional news which covers the county.
*Crawley is covered by both regions, but receives a better TV signal from BBC London and ITV London.

===Religion===
Christianity is the predominant religion in Sussex with 57.8 per cent of the population identifying as Christian in the 2011 census. Other results from the 2011 census are: 1.4 per cent as Muslim, 0.7 per cent as Hindu and 30.5 per cent as having no religion.

Sussex has been a single diocese of the established church since the eighth century, after St Wilfrid founded Selsey Abbey on land granted by King Æðelwealh, Sussex&#x27;s first Christian king. The Normans moved the location of Sussex&#x27;s cathedral to Chichester in 1075. Since 1965 Arundel Cathedral has been the seat of the Roman Catholic Bishops of Arundel and Brighton, which covers Sussex and Surrey. The established church and the Catholic Church were historically strongest in western and southern areas. In contrast, Protestant non-conformity was historically strongest in areas furthest from diocesan authorities in Chichester, in the south-west. This included in the Weald and in the east, where there were also links to Protestant northern Europe. St Richard of Chichester is Sussex&#x27;s patron saint.

According to the 2011 census there were about 23,000 Muslims in Sussex, constituting 1.4 per cent of the population. Within Sussex, Crawley had the highest proportion of Muslims with 7.2 per cent of the population.

Jewish people have been recorded as living in Sussex since the 12th century and are first mentioned in 1179/80 pipe roll for Chichester. A considerable Jewish community existed in Chichester by 1186. All Sussex&#x27;s Jews would have been expelled in 1290 when Edward I of England issued the Edict of Expulsion. A Jewish population had returned to Sussex by the late 18th century in Brighton and Arundel.

A wide variety of non-traditional religious and belief groups have bases in and around East Grinstead. Groups include the Church of Scientology at Saint Hill Manor, Opus Dei, the Rosicrucian Order, the Pagan Federation and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the Mormons).

===Science===
Pell&#x27;s equation and the Pell number are both named after 17th century mathematician John Pell. Pell is sometimes credited with inventing the division sign, which has also been attributed to Swiss mathematician Johann Heinrich Rahn, one of his students. In the 19th century, geologist and palaeontologist Gideon Mantell began the scientific study of dinosaurs. In 1822 he was responsible for the discovery and eventual identification of the first fossil teeth, and later much of the skeleton of Iguanodon. Braxton Hicks contractions are named after John Braxton Hicks, the Sussex doctor who in 1872 first described the uterine contractions not resulting in childbirth.
In the 20th century, Frederick Soddy won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on radioactive substances, and his investigations into the origin and nature of isotopes. Frederick Gowland Hopkins shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1929 with Christiaan Eijkman, for discovering the growth-stimulating vitamins. Martin Ryle shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1974 with Cornishman Antony Hewish, the first Nobel prize awarded in recognition of astronomical research. While working at the University of Sussex, Harold Kroto won the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Richard Smalley and Robert Curl from Rice University in the US for the discovery of fullerenes. David Mumford is a mathematician known for distinguished work in algebraic geometry and then for research into vision and pattern theory. He won the International Mathematical Union&#x27;s Fields Medal in 1974 and in 2010 was awarded the United States National Medal of Science.

In the social sciences, Sussex was home to economist John Maynard Keynes from 1925 to 1946. The founding father of Keynesian economics, he is widely considered to be one of the founders of modern macroeconomics and the most influential economist of the 20th century. David Pilbeam won the 1986 International Prize from the Fyssen Foundation.

In the early 20th century, Sussex was at the centre of one of what has been described as &#x27;British archaeology&#x27;s greatest hoax&#x27;. Bone fragments said to have been collected in 1912 were presented as the fossilised remains of a previously unknown early human, referred to as Piltdown Man. In 1953 the bone fragments were exposed as a forgery, consisting of the lower jawbone of an orangutan deliberately combined with the skull of a fully developed modern human. From 1967 to 1979, Sussex was home to the Isaac Newton Telescope at the Royal Greenwich Observatory in Herstmonceux Castle.

===Sport===

Sussex has a centuries-long tradition of sport. Sussex has played a key role in the early development of both cricket and stoolball. Cricket is recognised as having been formed in the Weald and Sussex is where cricket was first recorded as being played by men (in 1611), and by women (in 1677), as well as being the location of the first reference to a cricket bat (in 1622) and a wicket (in 1680). Founded in 1839, Sussex CCC is England&#x27;s oldest county cricket club and is the oldest professional sports club in the world. Slindon Cricket Club dominated the sport for a while in the 18th century. The cricket ground at Arundel Castle traditionally plays host to a Duke of Norfolk&#x27;s XI which plays the national test sides touring England. Founded in 1971, the Sussex Cricket League is believed to be the largest adult cricket league in the world, with 335 teams in 2018. Referred to as Sussex&#x27;s &#x27;national&#x27; sport and a Sussex game or pastime, Sussex may be where the sport of stoolball originated and is where the sport was formalised in the 19th century and its revival took place in the early 20th century.

Sussex is represented in the Premier League by Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and in the Football League by Crawley Town. Brighton has been a League member since 1920, whereas Crawley was promoted to the League in 2011. Brighton &amp; Hove Albion play in the FA Women&#x27;s Super League and Lewes play in the FA Women&#x27;s Championship. Sussex has had its own football association, since 1882 and its own football league, which has since expanded into Surrey, since 1920. In horse racing, Sussex is home to Goodwood, Fontwell Park, Brighton and Plumpton. The All England Jumping Course show jumping facility hosts the British Jumping Derby and the Royal International Horse Show. Eastbourne Eagles speedway team race in the SGB Championship.

===Cuisine===

The historic county is known for its &quot;seven good things of Sussex&quot;. These seven things are Pulborough eel, Selsey cockle, Chichester lobster, Rye herring, Arundel mullet, Amberley trout and Bourne wheatear. Sussex is also known for Ashdown Partridge Pudding, Chiddingly Hot pot, Sussex Bacon Pudding, Sussex Hogs&#x27; Pudding, Huffed Chicken, Sussex Churdles, Sussex Shepherds Pie, Sussex Pond Pudding, Sussex Blanket Pudding, Sussex Well Pudding, and Chichester Pudding. Sussex is also known for its cakes and biscuits known as Sussex Plum Heavies and Sussex Lardy Johns, while banoffee pie was first created in 1972 in Jevington.

The county has vineyards and a long history of brewing of beer. It is home to the 18th century beer brewers, Harveys of Lewes as well as many more recently established breweries. There are also many cider makers in Sussex, Hunts Sussex Cider and SeaCider are the largest cider producers. With 138 vineyards in 2023, Sussex has a quarter of the UK&#x27;s vineyards. In 2022, Sussex wine gained Protected Designation of Origin status following decades of international acclaim with Sussex wines winning awards around the world. Many vineyards make wines using traditional Champagne varieties and methods, and there are similarities between the topography and chalk and clay soils of Sussex downland and that of the Champagne region which lies on a latitude to the south.

===Visual arts===
Some of the earliest known art in Sussex is the carvings in the galleries of the Neolithic flint mines at Cissbury on the South Downs near Worthing. From the Roman period, the palace at Fishbourne has the largest in situ collection of mosaics in the UK, while the villa at Bignor contains some of the best preserved Roman mosaics in England.

Dating from around the 12th century, the &#x27;Lewes Group&#x27; of wall paintings can be found in several churches across the centre of Sussex, some of which are celebrated for their age, extent and quality. Of uncertain origin, the Long Man of Wilmington is Europe&#x27;s largest representation of the human form.

In the late 18th century three men commissioned important works of the county which ensured that its landscapes and daily life were captured onto canvas. William Burrell of Knepp Castle commissioned Swiss-born watercolourist Samuel Hieronymus Grimm to tour Sussex, producing 900 watercolours of the county&#x27;s buildings. George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont of Petworth House was a patron of painters such as J. M. W. Turner and John Constable. John &#x27;Mad Jack&#x27; Fuller also commissioned Turner to make a series of paintings which resulted in thirteen finished watercolours of Fuller&#x27;s house at Brightling and the area around it.

In the 19th century landscape watercolourist Copley Fielding lived in Sussex and illustrator Aubrey Beardsley and painter and sculptor Eric Gill were born in Brighton. Gill went on to found an art colony in Ditchling known as The Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic, which survived until 1989. The 1920s and 1930s saw the creation of some of the best-known works by Edward Burra who was known for his work of Sussex, Paris and Harlem and Eric Ravilious who is known for his paintings of the South Downs.

In the early 20th century Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, both members of the Bloomsbury Group, lived and worked at Charleston Farmhouse near Firle. Sussex also became a major centre for surrealism in the early 20th century. At West Dean, Edward James was patron to artists including Salvador Dalí and René Magritte while at Farley Farm House near Chiddingly the home of Roland Penrose and Lee Miller was frequented by artists such as Pablo Picasso, Man Ray, Henry Moore, Eileen Agar, Jean Dubuffet, Dorothea Tanning and Max Ernst. Both collections form one of the most important bodies of Surrealist art in Europe.

<text>The Kingdom of the South Saxons, today referred to as the Kingdom of Sussex (; from , in turn from or , meaning &quot;(land or people of/Kingdom of) the South Saxons&quot;), was one of the seven traditional kingdoms of the Heptarchy of Anglo-Saxon England. On the south coast of the island of Great Britain, it was originally a sixth-century Saxon colony and later an independent kingdom. The kingdom remains one of the least known of the Anglo-Saxon polities, with no surviving king-list, several local rulers and less centralisation than other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. The South Saxons were ruled by the kings of Sussex until the country was annexed by Wessex, probably in 827, in the aftermath of the Battle of Ellendun. In 860 Sussex was ruled by the kings of Wessex, and by 927 all remaining Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were ruled by them as part of the new kingdom of England.

The foundation legend of the kingdom of Sussex is that in 477 Ælle and his three sons arrived in three ships, conquering what is now Sussex. Ælle became overlord, or &quot;Bretwalda&quot;, over the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms south of the Humber. Historians are divided over whether or not Ælle really existed; however archaeological evidence supports the view that a short-lived expansion of South Saxon authority as far as the Midlands may have taken place in the 5th century.

For much of the 7th and 8th centuries, Sussex suffered invasion attempts by the kingdom of Wessex to its west. King Æðelwealh formed an alliance with Christian Mercia against Wessex, becoming Sussex&#x27;s first Christian king. With support from St Wilfrid, Sussex became the last major Anglo-Saxon kingdom to become Christian. South Saxon and Mercian forces took control of what are now east Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Cædwalla of Wessex killed Æðelwealh and &quot;ravaged Sussex by fierce slaughter and devastation&quot;. The South Saxons forced Cædwalla from Sussex and were able to lead a campaign into Kent, replacing its king. At that time Sussex could have re-emerged into a regional power. Shortly afterwards, Cædwalla returned to Sussex, killing its king and putting its people into what Bede called &quot;a worse state of slavery&quot;. The South Saxon clergy were put under the control of West Saxon Winchester. Only around 715 was Eadberht of Selsey made the first bishop of the South Saxons, after which further invasion attempts from Wessex ensued.

Following a period of rule by King Offa of Mercia, Sussex regained its independence but was annexed by Wessex around 827 and was fully absorbed into the kingdom of Wessex in 860.

==Geography==

The Kingdom of Sussex had its initial focus in a territory based on the former kingdom and Romano-British &quot;civitas&quot; of the &quot;Regni&quot; and its boundaries coincided in general with those of the later county of Sussex. For a brief period in the 7th century, the Kingdom of Sussex controlled the Isle of Wight and the territory of the &quot;Meonwara&quot; in the Meon Valley in east Hampshire. From the late 8th century, Sussex seems to have absorbed the Kingdom of the &quot;Haestingas&quot;, after the region was conquered by the Mercian king Offa.

A large part of its territory was covered by the forest that took its name from the fort of &quot;Anderitum&quot; at modern Pevensey, and known to the Romano-British as the Forest of Andred and to the Saxons as or , known today as the Weald. This forest, according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, was wide and deep (although probably closer to wide). It was the largest remaining area of woodland and heath in the territories that became England and was inhabited by wolves, boars and possibly bears. It was so dense that &quot;Domesday Book&quot; did not record some of its settlements. The heavily forested Weald made expansion difficult but also provided some protection from invasion by neighbouring kingdoms. While Sussex&#x27;s isolation from the rest of Anglo-Saxon England has been emphasised, Roman roads must have remained important communication arteries across the forest of the Weald. The Weald was not the only area of Sussex that was forested in Saxon times—for example, at the western end of Sussex is the Manhood Peninsula, which in the modern era is largely deforested, but the name is probably derived from the Old English meaning &quot;men&#x27;s wood&quot; or &quot;common wood&quot; indicating that it was once woodland.

The coastline would have looked different from today. Much of the alluvium in the river plains had not yet been deposited and the tidal river estuaries extended much further inland. It is estimated that the coastal plain may have been at least one mile broader than it is today. Before people reclaimed the tidal marshes in the 13th century the coastal plain contained extensive areas of sea water in the form of lagoons, salt marsh, wide inlets, islands and peninsulas. To the South Saxons of the 5th and 6th centuries this coastline must have resembled their original homeland between coastal Friesland, Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein.

The landscape gave rise to some key regional differences within the kingdom. The rich coastal plain continued to be the base for the large estates, ruled by their thegns, some of whom had their boundaries confirmed by charters. The Downs were more deserted. South Saxon impact was greatest in the Weald. Along the north scarp of the Downs runs a series of parishes with land evenly distributed across the different soils to their northern boundaries; the parishes were more or less equal in area, around . In the early mediaeval period, the rivers of Sussex may have acted locally as a major unifier, linking coastal, estuary and riverside communities and providing people in these areas with a sense of identity.

The boundaries of the Kingdom of Sussex probably crystallised around the 6th and 7th centuries. The Domesday Book lists four Mardens on the East Hampshire/ West Sussex border. The Old English for Marden would have been meaning &quot;boundary down&quot;, reflecting their position. A tributary of the River Ems rises south of Stoughton and travels north to North Marden, completing the western boundary of the South Saxons. Bede described the western boundary with the Kingdom of Wessex as being opposite the Isle of Wight. To the east at Romney Marsh and the River Limen (now called the River Rother or Kent Ditch), Sussex shared a border with the Kingdom of Kent. North of the Forest Ridge in the Wealden forest lay the sub-kingdom of Surrey, which became a frontier area disputed by various kingdoms until it later became part of Wessex. To the south of Sussex lay the English Channel, beyond which lay Francia, or the Kingdom of the Franks.

By the 680s, when Christianity was being introduced, there is no doubt that the district around Selsey and Chichester had become the political centre of the kingdom, though there is little archaeological evidence for a reoccupation of Chichester itself before the 9th century. Ditchling may have been an important regional centre for a large part of central Sussex between the Rivers Adur and Ouse until the founding of Lewes in the 9th century. By the 11th century the towns were mostly developments of the fortified towns () founded in the reign of Alfred the Great.

The ancient droveways of Sussex linked coastal and downland communities in the south with summer pasture land in the interior of the Weald. The droveways were used throughout the Saxon era by the South Saxons and probably originated before the Roman occupation of Britain. The droveways formed a road system that clearly suggests that the settlers in the oldest developed parts of Sussex were concerned not so much with east–west connections between neighbouring settlements as with north–south communication between each settlement and its outlying woodland pasture. The droving roads had an enduring effect on the pattern of Sussex settlement. When churches came to be built, an ideal site was where a drove crossed a river. Eventually traders gravitated to churches, founding villages, and in some cases market towns such as Ditchling, Shermanbury, Thakeham, Ashurst and Shipley. Different names existed for the swine pastures in different parts of Sussex. In the territory of the in the east, swine pastures were named , in the centre they were referred to as &quot;styes&quot; () and in the west, . These places grew from being sheds for animals and temporary huts for swineherders, to permanent farms, water-mills, churches and market towns. Churches in the High Weald are mostly on isolated ridge-top sites, away from the pioneer farms being established on the valley sides, as at Worth and Itchingfield to this day.

Land divisions in the Kingdom of Sussex were sometimes different from other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and regions. By the Late Saxon period, the main administrative unit of Sussex was the district known as the rape. Their origins may be earlier, possibly originating in the Romano-British period. The rapes were sub-divided into hundreds, which served as taxation and administrative districts. In England generally these contained a nominal 100 hides (a measure of taxable value linked to land area) but in Sussex they were generally much smaller. Sussex may also have had eight virgates for every hide; in most of England a hide was usually made up of four virgates.

==Population==
The population of Britain as a whole is likely to have declined sharply around the 4th century from around 2–4 million in AD 200 to less than 1 million in AD 300. There would have been a similarly sharp decline in the population of Sussex during this period. At the end of the 4th century there was a decline in the birth rate across Roman Britain; this population decrease would have been exacerbated by the transfer to Continental Europe of three large armies, recruited in Britain in the last 30 years of Roman rule, as well as plague and barbarian attack. Sussex&#x27;s population around 450 is estimated to have been no more than about 25,000, rising gradually to around 35,000 by 1100. At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, Sussex had some of the highest population densities in England.

Approximate populations of Sussex towns shortly after the end of the Saxon period in 1086 at the time of the Domesday Book may have been as follows:

==History==
===Foundation story===
The account of Ælle and his three sons landing at appears in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, a collection of seven vernacular manuscripts, commissioned in the 9th century, some 400 years or more after the events at .
The account describes how on landing Ælle slew the local defenders and drove the remainder into the Forest of Andred. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle goes on to describe Ælle&#x27;s battle with the British in 485 near the bank of &quot;Mercredesburne&quot;, and his siege of the Saxon Shore fort at &quot;Andredadsceaster&quot; (modern day Pevensey) in 491 after which the inhabitants were massacred.

The legendary foundation of Saxon Sussex, by Ælle, is likely to have originated in an oral tradition before being recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. According to legend, various places took their names from Ælle&#x27;s sons. Cissa is supposed to have given his name to Chichester, Cymen to &quot;Cymenshore&quot; and Wlencing to Lancing. is traditionally thought to have been located at what is now known as the Owers Rocks, south of Selsey, however there is no archaeological evidence to support the existence of Ælle and his three sons in the Selsey area.

From 491 until the arrival of Christianity in the 7th century, there was a dearth of contemporary written material.Because of the lack of written history before the 7th century it has made it difficult for historians to produce a definitive story. The preservation of Ælle&#x27;s sons in Old English place names is unusual. The names of the founders, in other origin legends, seem to have British and/ or Latin roots not Old English. It is likely that the foundation stories were known before the 9th century, but the annalists manipulated them to provide a common origin for the new regime. These myths proport that the British were defeated and replaced by invading Anglo-Saxons arriving in small ships. These origin stories were largely believed right up to the 19th century.

===Early period ( – 600)===

Archaeology gives a different settlement picture to that indicated by the South Saxon foundation story. Germanic tribes probably first arrived in Sussex earlier in the 5th century than AD 477. The archaeological evidence that we do have indicates the area of settlement by the location of cemeteries of the period. The origins of the settlers can be derived by comparing the design of grave goods and pottery with the designs of similar items in the German homelands. The principal area of settlement in the 5th century has been identified as between the lower Ouse and Cuckmere rivers in East Sussex, based on the number of Anglo-Saxon cemeteries there. However, there are two cemeteries in West Sussex at Highdown, near Worthing and Apple Down, 11 km (7 mi.) northwest of Chichester. The area between the Ouse and Cuckmere was believed to have been the location for the federate treaty settlement of Anglo-Saxon mercenaries. Whatever the original settlement pattern of the early Germanic settlers, their culture came to rapidly dominate the whole of Sussex.

There is some evidence to support the treaty hypothesis, based on the grave finds of the period. For example, the excavation of one of the cemeteries, at Rookery Hill at Bishopstone, East Sussex, yielded late Roman or insular Roman metalwork including a Quoit Brooch Style buckle, which would indicate settlement here to the early 5th century.
Subsequent excavations revealed a considerable area of Saxon buildings. Of the 22 buildings excavated, three were sunken huts, 17 are rectangular founded on individual post holes, one is represented by post holes between which are beam slots, and one by eight single large posts.

Highdown is the only 5th-century Saxon cemetery found outside the Ouse/Cuckmere area, and is 2 km from a hoard of Roman gold and silver that was found in 1997. The Patching hoard, as it came to be known, contained a coin as recent as AD 470. Thus, Highdown cemetery would have been in use by Saxons when the hoard was buried at Patching. The settlement that used Highdown as a burial ground in the 5th century has never been identified, but White speculates that there may have been some link between Patching and Highdown, and Welch has suggested that a Romano-British community was based there and that they controlled a group of Saxon mercenaries.

Despite the difficulties presented by the large forest tract of the Weald that separated Sussex from Surrey, similarities in the archaeological record from this period between Sussex and Surrey help to substantiate the claim of Ælle of Sussex to be the first &quot;Bretwalda&quot; in the Thames Valley. Such unified regional commands were probably not long-lasting. J. N. L. Myres posits that archaeological evidence, in the form of distinctive Saxon saucer brooches, suggests that Ælle&#x27;s forces penetrated north as far as modern day Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire to the west. H. R. Loyn suggests that this initial regional hegemony may have ended after the Battle of Mount Badon.

===Christianisation and loss of independence (600–860)===
After 491 the written history of Sussex goes blank until 607, when the annals report that Ceolwulf of Wessex fought against the South Saxons. Threatened by Wessex, the South Saxons sought to secure their independence by alliance with Mercia. To the South Saxons, the more distant influence and control of a king from Mercia is likely to have been preferable to that of the West Saxons. The alliance between Mercia and the South Saxons was further sealed by Æðelwealh, king of Sussex, receiving baptism into the Christian church through the Mercian court, with Wulfhere acting as his sponsor, making Æðelwealh Sussex&#x27;s first Christian king. Wulfhere gave Æðelwealh the Isle of Wight and the territory of the &quot;Meonwara&quot; (the Meon valley of present-day Hampshire). Æðelwealh also married Eabe, a princess of the &quot;Hwicce&quot;, a Mercian satellite province.

In 681, the exiled St Wilfrid of Northumbria arrived in the kingdom of the South Saxons and remained there for five years evangelising and baptising the people. There had been a famine in the land of the South Saxons when Wilfrid arrived. Wilfrid taught the locals to fish, and they were impressed with Wilfrid&#x27;s teachings and agreed to be baptised &quot;en masse&quot;. On the day of the baptisms the rain fell on the &quot;thirsty earth&quot;, so ending the famine. Æðelwealh gave 87 hides (an area of land) and a royal vill to Wilfrid to enable him to found Selsey Abbey. The abbey eventually became the seat of the South Saxon bishopric, where it remained until after the Norman Conquest, when it was moved to Chichester by decree of the Council of London of 1075.

Shortly after the arrival of St Wilfrid, the kingdom was ravaged with &quot;fierce slaughter and devastation&quot; and Æðelwealh was slain by an exiled West Saxon prince Cædwalla. The latter was eventually expelled, by Æðelwealh&#x27;s successors, two Ealdormen named Berhthun and Andhun. In 686 the South Saxons attacked Hlothhere, king of Kent, in support of his nephew Eadric, who afterwards became king of Kent. At this time, a new South Saxon hegemony extending from the Isle of Wight into Kent could conceivably have seen Sussex re-emerge as a regional power but the revival of Wessex ended this possibility. Eadric&#x27;s rule in Kent lasted until Kent was invaded by Cædwalla who had managed to establish himself as ruler of Wessex. With his additional resources, Cædwalla once more invaded Sussex, killing Berhthun. Sussex now became for some years subject to a period of harsh West Saxon domination. According to Bede, the subjection reduced the kingdom of Sussex to &quot;a worse state of slavery&quot;; it also included placing the South Saxon clergy under the authority of Wessex through the bishops of Winchester. Cædwalla also seized the Isle of Wight where he ruthlessly exterminated its population, including its royal line. According to David Dumville, Cædwalla&#x27;s savage behaviour towards Sussex and the Isle of Wight can be explained by Sussex&#x27;s westward expansion with assistance from Mercia at the expense of Wessex and Cædwalla was determined that this should never happen again.

Of the later South Saxon kings we have little knowledge except from occasional charters. In 692 a grant is made by a king called Noðhelm (or &quot;Nunna&quot;) to his sister, which is witnessed by another king called Watt. There is a theory that Watt may have been a sub-king who ruled over a tribe of people centred around modern day Hastings, known as the &quot;Haestingas&quot; and Nunna is described, in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, as the kinsman of Ine of Wessex who fought with him against Geraint, King of the Britons, in 710. According to Bede, Sussex was subject to Ine for a number of years and like Cædwalla, Ine also oppressed the people of Sussex in the same harsh way for many years.

In 710 Sussex was still under West Saxon domination when King Nothhelm of Sussex is recorded as having campaigned with Ine in the west against Dumnonia. Sussex evidently broke away from West Saxon domination some time before 722 when Ine is recorded as invading Sussex, which he repeated three years later, killing a West Saxon exile named Ealdberht who had fled to the Weald of Sussex and Surrey and appears to have attempted to find support in Sussex. The &quot;Anglo Saxon Chronicle&quot; records a further campaign against the South Saxons by the West Saxons in 725.

According to a charter dated 775, the former abbot of Selsey, Bishop Eadberht of Selsey ( x?709) – (716 x?), was given a grant of land by King Nunna; the document included King Watt as a witness. However, the charter is now believed to have been a 10th- or early-11th-century forgery.

There is another charter, that is thought to be genuine, that records a series of transactions of a piece of land near modern-day Burpham in the Arun Valley.
It starts off with a grant of land, at Peppering, by Nunna to Berhfrith probably for the foundation of a minster.
Berhfrith transferred the land to Eolla, who in turn sold it to Wulfhere. The land then went to Beoba who passed it on to Beorra and Ecca. Finally King Osmund bought the land from his comes Erra and granted it to a religious woman known as Tidburgh. The charter is undated but it has been possible to date the various transactions approximately, by cross referencing people who appear both on this charter and on other charters that &quot;do&quot; provide dates. On the transaction, where Eolla has acquired the land from Berhfrith and sells it to Wulfhere [ x (716x?)], Nunna&#x27;s subscription is followed by a certain Osric who was possibly Nunna&#x27;s co-ruler. The other witnesses who followed Osric were Eadberht and Eolla, both who can be identified as ecclesiastics.

Nunna&#x27;s last surviving charter, which is dated 714 in error for 717, is witnessed by a King Æðelstan.

A little later, Æðelberht was King of Sussex, but he is known only from charters. The dates of Æðelberht&#x27;s reign are unknown beyond the fact that he was a contemporary of Sigeferth, Bishop of Selsey from 733, as Sigeferth witnessed an undated charter of Æðelberht in which Æðelberht is styled Ethelbertus rex Sussaxonum.

After this we hear nothing more until about 765, when a grant of land is made by a king named Ealdwulf, with two other kings, Ælfwald and Oslac, as witnesses.

In 765 and 770 grants are made by a King Osmund, the latter one was later confirmed by Offa of Mercia.

The independent existence of the Kingdom of Sussex came to an end in the early 770s. In 771, King Offa of Mercia conquered the territory of the &quot;Haestingas&quot;; he may have entered Sussex from the Kingdom of Kent, where he was already dominant. By 772 he apparently controlled the whole of the Kingdom of Sussex. Offa also confirmed two charters of Æðelberht, and in 772 he grants land himself in Sussex, with Oswald, &quot;dux Suðsax&quot;, as a witness. It is probable that about this time Offa annexed the kingdom of Sussex, as several persons, Osmund, Ælfwald and Oslac, who had previously used the royal title, now sign with that of &quot;dux&quot;.

Offa may not have been able to maintain control in the period 776–785 but he appears to have re-established control afterwards. Mercian power collapsed in the years following Offa&#x27;s death in 796, and the South Saxons re-emerged as an independent political entity.

After the Battle of Ellandun in 825 the South Saxons submitted to Ecgberht of Wessex, and from this time they remained subject to the West Saxon dynasty. According to Heather Edwards in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, it is probable that Sussex was not annexed by Wessex until 827. The earldom of Sussex seems later to have been sometimes combined with that of Kent. Æthelberht of Wessex was ruling Sussex and the other south-eastern kingdoms by 855, and succeeded to the kingship of Wessex on the death of his brother, King Æthelbald, thus bringing Sussex fully under the crown of Wessex.

===Ealdormanry and shire (860–1066)===
From 895 Sussex suffered from constant raids by the Danes, until the accession of Canute, after which arose the two great forces of the house of Godwine and of the Normans. Godwine was probably a native of Sussex, and by the end of Edward the Confessor&#x27;s reign a third part of the county was in the hands of his family.

The death of Eadwine, Ealdorman of Sussex, is recorded in 982, because he was buried at Abingdon Abbey in Berkshire, where one version of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; was compiled. According to the abbey&#x27;s records, in which he was called (Eadwine leader of the South Saxons), he bequeathed estates to them in his will, although the document itself has not survived. Earlier in the same year he witnessed a charter of King Ethelred the Unready as . His name was also added to a forged charter dated 956 (possibly an error for 976).

In the next generation, Wulfnoth Cild, a Sussex thegn, played a prominent part in English politics. In 1009 his actions resulted in the destruction of the English fleet, and by 1011 Sussex, together with most of South East England, was in the hands of the Danes. In an early example of local government reform, the Anglo-Saxon ealdormanries were abolished by the Danish kings and replaced with a smaller number of larger earldoms. Wulfnoth Cild was the father of Godwin, who was made Earl of Wessex in 1020. His earldom included Sussex. When he died in 1053, Godwin was succeeded as Earl of Wessex (including Sussex) by his son Harold, who had previously been Earl of East Anglia.

Edward the Confessor, who had spent much of his early life in exile in Normandy, was pro-Norman and in Sussex gave to the abbot of Fécamp Abbey the minster church at Steyning, as well as confirming land existing land grants at Hastings, Rye and Winchelsea. To his chaplain, Osborn, later William&#x27;s Bishop of Exeter, Edward gave the harbour and other land at Bosham. Many of the Saxon nobles grew jealous and from 1049 there was conflict between the disgruntled Saxon nobility, the king and the incoming Normans. Godwine and his second son Harold kept the peace off the Sussex coast by using Bosham and Pevensey to drive away pirates. In 1049 the murder by Sweyn Godwinson of his cousin Beorn after Beorn has been tricked in going to Bosham resulted in the entire Godwine family being banished. It was from Bosham in 1051 that Godwin, Sweyn and Tostig fled to Bruges and the court of Baldwin V, Count of Flanders, a relative of Tostig&#x27;s wife, Judith of Flanders. When they returned in 1052 to an enthusiastic welcome in the Sussex ports, Edward had to reinstate the Godwine family.

In 1064 Harold sailed from Bosham, from where a storm cast him up in Normandy. Here he was apparently tricked into pledging his support for William of Normandy as the next king of England. On 14 October 1066, Harold II, the last Saxon king of England was killed at the Battle of Hastings and the English army defeated, by William the Conqueror and his army. It is likely that all the fighting men of Sussex were at the battle, as the county&#x27;s thegns were decimated and any that survived had their lands confiscated. At least 353 of the 387 manors, in the county, were taken from their Saxon owners and given to the victorious Normans by the Conqueror, and Saxon power in Sussex was at an end.

==Life and society==

===Defence and warfare===
The earliest recorded Viking raid on Sussex took place in 895 and it was particularly difficult for a scattered farming community to meet these sudden attacks. In 895 the population of Chichester killed many hundreds of Danes who plundered the area. Eadulf, a Saxon noble, was appointed to organise the defence of Sussex but died from the plague before much could be done.

Alfred the Great almost certainly inaugurated the building of a series of or forts to be garrisoned at the threat of danger by men drawn from the surrounding population. The development of the burhs across the southern half of England suggests a considerable awareness of a repeated problem The Burghal Hidage documents five such fortifications in Sussex — at Chichester, Burpham, Lewes, Hastings and &quot;Eorpeburnan&quot;.

In the reign of Æthelred the Unready, the threat of the Danes continued — in 994 and 1000 the &quot;Anglo Saxon Chronicle&quot; records burning, plundering and manslaughter on the coast of Sussex and neighbouring counties. The most serious attacks took place in 1009, when a Viking army took up position over the winter period on the Isle of Wight and ravaged Sussex, Hampshire and Berkshire.

The rectilinear street plan of Chichester is typical of the towns which developed from the fortified , which had intramural streets running around the town walls; this allowed garrison troops to defend the town and large peripheral blocks that were left as hedged areas () into which fugitives from the countryside could flee.

===Economy===
Deposited around as the kingdom of Sussex was being established, the Patching hoard of coins represents the earliest early mediaeval coins found in Britain. The hoard includes five imported &quot;siliquae&quot; that had not been clipped, so coin-clipping had probably ceased by then, although the coinage had probably collapsed decades earlier than this, after Roman rule in Britain collapsed.

In the first quarter of the 8th century the Kingdom of Sussex was among the kingdoms producing coinage, possibly from a mint near Selsey where the finds of coins termed Series G &quot;sceattas&quot; are concentrated. That a cash economy had returned by the 10th century is suggested by the various mints which became increasingly plentiful after King Æthelstan reorganised England&#x27;s coinage. There were mints at Chichester, Lewes and Steyning. A new mint also seems to have existed on a temporary basis in the Iron Age hillfort at Cissbury, which may have been refortified as a refuge during the Danish invasions in the reign of Æthelred the Unready. The Cissbury mint seems to have worked in close association with the mint at Chichester rather than replacing it. By the eve of the Norman conquest, there were further mints at Arundel, Pevensey and Hastings.

Lewes seems to have prospered with overseas trade; coins from Lewes stamped &quot;LAE URB&quot; travelled as far as Rome. The substantial sea-faring trade of Lewes is indicated by the payment of 20 shillings for munitions of war payable whenever Edward the Confessor&#x27;s fleet put to sea. This is the probable origin of the Cinque Ports organisation that flourished under the Normans. The River Ouse would have been navigable at least as far north as Lewes. Armstrong argues that while Sussex was separated from much else of mainstream English experience, this should not hide the rich trade that Sussex had with other parts of Europe. By the 1060s Lewes also supported a cattle market.

By the end of the Anglo Saxon period and the Domesday Survey by the Normans in 1086, Sussex contained some of the richest and most heavily populated pockets of England on the coastal plain, albeit alongside some of England&#x27;s most economically underdeveloped areas in the Weald. By this time, Sussex had a network of urban centres such that farmers were within 15 km to 30 km of market facilities.

Agriculture seems to have flourished on the Sussex coastal plain and on the Sussex Downs. The fact that the Sussex coast appears to have been relatively densely settled for centuries implies that the land was being more competently farmed than was typical of the standard of the day. The Weald was pig-fattening and cattle-grazing country. Drovers would divide their year between their &quot;winter house&quot; in their parent village outside the Weald and their &quot;summer house&quot; in the outlying woodland pasture up to away. Surviving features include a close network of former droveways and surviving fragments of wood pasture, such as the Mens and Ebernoe Common near Petworth.

The Domesday Book records that by the 11th century, the unknown Rameslie in Sussex had 100 salt pans to extract salt from sea water. Fisheries were also important to the economy of Sussex. Lewes was an important centre of a herring industry and had to pay a rent of 38,500 herrings for its sea fisheries.

===Capital===
At the time of the South Saxons it is unlikely that they would have had a capital in Sussex. The archaeologist Martin Biddle said that &quot;the evidence we have for the residences and itineraries of English kings before the Norman conquest is all too thin&quot; and according to Frank Stenton &quot;In the eleventh century the conception of a capital city had not yet taken a definite shape anywhere in the west. The centre of government in England was the kings&#x27; mobile court. The king was free to hold a council at any point in his realm..&quot; In Roman times Chichester was known as Noviomagus Reginorum and served as the capital of the &quot;Civitas Reginorum&quot;, a client kingdom ruled by Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus. After the departure of the Romans, Noviomagus appears to have been largely abandoned with the earliest Saxon find, by archaeological excavation, being a small amount of mid-Saxon pottery dated around 8th-9th century.

Before Saxon occupation of Chichester, Sussex had been annexed, by the Kingdom of Wessex, in the middle of the 7th century.It was then ruled by Mercia and after regaining its independence, it was finally annexed and then absorbed, into Wessex, in 860.
The Anglo Saxon Chronicle suggests that Sussex was founded in the Selsey and Chichester area, however the archaeology does not support this. What the archaeology does show is that the initial settlement, of the South Saxons, was in the downland areas, between the River Ouse and River Cuckmere to the east of Sussex. From there the South Saxons migrated to the west of Sussex and by the 680s the area between Chichester and Selsey had become the political and ecclesiastical centre of the kingdom with the kings residence in &quot;Orreo Regis&quot; (Kingsham), south west of Chichester, and Wilfrid&#x27;s religious centre in Selsey. According to Martin Welch &quot;After the Romans left there is no evidence for the reoccupation of Chichester till the 9th century&quot;, when it was rebuilt and fortified as part of a programme of defence, instigated by Alfred the Great, of Wessex, to protect against Danish raids.

===Kingship===

The South Saxon kingdom remains one of the most obscure of the Anglo-Saxon polities. A few names of South Saxon kings are recorded, and the history of the kingdom is sometimes illustrated by that of other areas, but information is otherwise limited. Sussex seems to have had a greater degree of decentralisation than other kingdoms. For a period during the 760s there may have been as many as four or five kings based within the territory, perhaps with each ruling over a distinct tribal territory, perhaps on a temporary basis. It seems possible that the people of the &quot;Haestingas&quot; may have had their own ruler for a while, and another sub-division may have been along the River Adur.

Complex tiers of relationships between kings and kingdoms existed. For instance in the 7th century, when Wulfhere of Mercia was trying to increase his influence over the South Saxons, he ceded control of the provinces of the &quot;Meonwara&quot; and Wight to the South Saxon king Æðelwealh. Wight at least had its own ruler, Arvald, who presumably recognised the authority of the South Saxon king, Æðelwealh, and who in turn recognised the overlordship of the Mercian king, Wulfhere.

The Kingdom of Sussex was an independent unit until the reign of Offa of Mercia. Under Offa, who ruled over most of the kingdoms of the heptarchy, local South Saxon rulers were allowed to continue provided that they recognised Offa&#x27;s overriding authority and some estates seem to have come into his direct possession.

In the 9th century, Sussex was ruled by the West Saxons. It would appear that the ultimate intention of Æthelwulf of Wessex was for the kingdom of Wessex and the eastern regions of Sussex, Surrey, Kent and Essex to become separate kingdoms, with separate but related royal dynasties. It was only the early deaths of Aethelwulf&#x27;s first two sons that allowed Æthelbert of Wessex, his third son, to reunite Wessex and the eastern regions, including Sussex, into a single kingdom in 860. This occurred only after Athelberht had secured the consent of his younger brothers, Aethelred and Alfred. Though in part due to the careful cultivation of conquered regions, the establishment of an enduring &quot;Greater Wessex&quot; stretching along the southern coast owed much to chance, early deaths, and perhaps, to the growing recognition of the need for unity in the face of an increasing Viking threat. Sussex was never again treated as part of an eastern subkingdom but was not closely integrated with the old West Saxon provinces either. Sussex seems to have had its own ealdorman for much of the 10th century.

Royal tributes and dues were often collected at settlements known as king&#x27;s tuns, often a separate place from where the royal hall of that the king would stay when in the area. Sussex has several places that are king&#x27;s tuns including from west to east, Kingston by Ferring, Kingston by Sea, now part of Shoreham-by-Sea, and Kingston near Lewes. King&#x27;s tuns in Anglo-Saxon England often acted as places of assembly, where the king could settle disputes or hear appeals. According to Æthelstan, the first king of England, his grandmother Ælfthryth had the use of an estate at &quot;Æthelingadene&quot; (East and West Dean near Chichester). Ælfthryth may have brought up her grandchildren, the sons of Æthelred of Wessex, at &quot;Æthelingadene&quot;, which may have been one of the estates set aside for the benefit of the royal princes or Æthelings.

===Law===
Various folkmoots would have been held in Sussex, for instance at Ditchling, Tinhale (in Bersted) and Madehurst. Placename evidence for early assemblies in Sussex comes from Tinhale (from the Old English (thing) meaning hold a meeting, so &quot;meeting-hill&quot;) and Madehurst (from the Old English meaning assembly, so &quot;assembly wooded hill&quot;). There is also a location in Durrington that had the name meaning a moot barrow or meeting barrow, a boundary barrow.

The early hundreds often lacked the formality of later attempts of local government: frequently they met in the open, at a convenient central spot, perhaps marked by a tree, as at Easebourne. Dill, meaning the boarded meeting place, was one of the few hundreds in Sussex that provided any accommodation. From the 10th century onwards the hundred became important as a court of justice as well as dealing with matters of local administration. The meeting place was often a point within the hundred such as a bridge (as in the bridge over the western River Rother in Rotherbridge hundred) or a notable tree (such as a tree called Tippa&#x27;s Oak in Tipnoak hundred).

It is also recorded that an England-wide Royal Council () took place in Sussex on 3 April 930, when Æthelstan, the first king of the English, and his councillors gathered at Lyminster by the River Arun. Another took place in Sussex in the reign of Æthelstan (924-939), probably at Hamsey, on the River Ouse near Lewes.

A small number of diplomas (documents affirming the grant or tenure of specified land) from Sussex survive from this period.

By the 1060s Lewes may have been Sussex&#x27;s legal centre.

===Religion===

After the departure of the Roman army, the Saxons arrived in Sussex in the 5th century and brought with them their polytheistic religion. The Saxon pagan culture probably caused a reversal of the spread of Christianity. Wilfrid&#x27;s biographer records that in the year 666 Wilfrid&#x27;s ship ran aground on the Sussex coast near Selsey where it was attacked and a pagan priest sought to cast magic spells from a high mound. Bede also refers to a mass suicide committed by groups of 40 or 50 men who jumped from cliffs during a time of famine. It is probable that these suicides represented sacrifices to appease the god Woden.

Æðelwealh became Sussex&#x27;s first Christian king when he married Eafe, the daughter of Wulfhere, the Christian king of Mercia. In 681 AD Saint Wilfrid, the exiled Bishop of York, landed at Selsey and is credited with evangelising the local population and founding the church in Sussex. King Æðelwealh granted land to Wilfrid which became the site of Selsey Abbey. According to Bede, it was the last area of the country to be converted. While Wilfrid is credited with the conversion of the Kingdom of Sussex to Christianity, it is unlikely that it was wholly heathen when he arrived. Æðelwealh, Sussex&#x27;s king, had been baptised. Damianus, a South Saxon, was made Bishop of Rochester in the Kingdom of Kent in the 650s and may indicate earlier missionary work in the first half of the 7th century. At the time of Wilfrid&#x27;s mission there was a monastery at Bosham containing a few monks led by an Irish monk named Dicul, which was probably part of the Hiberno-Scottish mission of the time. Wilfrid was a champion of Roman customs and it was these customs that were adopted by the church in Sussex rather than the Celtic customs that had taken root in Scotland and Ireland.

Shortly after Æðelwealh granted land to Wilfrid for the church, Æðelwealh was killed by Cædwalla of Wessex, Sussex was conquered by Cædwalla and Christianity in Sussex was put under control of the diocese of Winchester. It was not until that Eadberht, Abbot of Selsey was consecrated the first bishop of the South Saxons.

In the late 7th or early 8th century, St. Cuthman, a shepherd who may have been born in Chidham and had been reduced to begging set out from his home with his disabled mother using a one-wheeled cart. When he reached Steyning he saw a vision and stopped there to build a church. Cuthman was venerated as a saint and his church was in existence by 857 when King Æthelwulf of Wessex was buried there. Steyning was an important religious centre and St Cuthman&#x27;s grave became a place of pilgrimage in the 10th and 11th centuries. According to the hagiography of the 11th century Secgan manuscript, another saint, St Cuthflæd of Lyminster, is buried in or near to Lyminster Priory. In 681, Bede records that an outbreak of the plague had devastated parts of England, including Sussex and the monks at Selsey Abbey fasted and prayed for three days for an end to the outbreak. A young boy with the plague prayed to St Oswald and his prayers were answered, and a vision of St Peter and St Paul was said to have appeared to the boy, telling the boy that he would be the last to die.

The church built at Steyning was one of around 50 minster churches across Sussex and these churches supplied itinerant clergy to surrounding districts. Other examples include churches at Singleton, Lyminster, Findon and Bishopstone. The jurisdiction of each minster church in the pre-Viking era seems to match early land divisions that were replaced by hundreds in the 10th or 11th centuries. It was not until 200–300 years after its conversion to Christianity in the 680s that a network of local parish churches existed in Sussex.

===Slavery===
Wilfrid&#x27;s first act after he was given land at Selsey by King Æðelwealh was to build a monastery to free 250 male and female slaves from slavery who were tied to the estate. These people were probably mainly of Romano-British descent. This is an indication of the very high percentage of slaves in England at this time. Fisher argues that slavery would have been the fate of many people of Romano-British descent at this time. By the 11th century it has been estimated that the proportion of slaves in Sussex was very low at around 4 per cent, some of the lowest rates in England; this compares with 25 per cent in Gloucestershire, 18 per cent in Hampshire and 10 per cent in Kent.

==Culture==

There is significant evidence for Frankish cultural influence on the kingdom of Sussex as well as the neighbouring kingdom of Kent; occasional references in Continental works suggest that Frankish kings may at one point have thought of the people of Sussex and other south eastern kingdoms as their political dependants.

According to Gabor Thomas, there are clear cultural differences between how wealth and status were expressed in South Saxon society compared with Anglo Saxon kingdoms to the north. In the kingdom of Sussex and the neighbouring kingdom of Kent the range of ornamented dress accessories metalwork is significantly more austere and limited that in kingdoms to the north. However alternative status symbols were used fully in Sussex by those with higher status. Archaeological evidence shows that luxury food items were consumed in Sussex and exuberant architectural displays were constructed, such as a cellared tower excavated at Bishopstone.

===Art===
From the beginning of the 6th century, Merovingian artefacts were present in Sussex, as they were in Kent and on the Isle of Wight, which is thought to reflect cross-Channel exchanges between Saxon Sussex and Merovingian Gaul. Assemblages such as have been found in Eastbourne show that Merovingian dress fashion had spread along the coastline of what is now Sussex, Kent and Hampshire and northern Gaul. Cemeteries at Alfriston, Highdown and Eastbourne show continuous contacts with Gaul from the first half of the 5th century until the early 7th century.

==Heraldic device==
The shield or emblem of Sussex, sometimes referred to as a coat of arms, consists of six gold martlets on a blue field. was attributed to the Kingdom of Sussex later in a work called &quot;Saxon Heptarchy&quot; by John Speed that dates from 1611. The depiction shows Ælle of Sussex, the founder and first king of Sussex, holding the shield over his shoulder.
