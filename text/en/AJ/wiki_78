<text>Yuri Vladimirovich Andropov ( – 9 February 1984) was a Soviet politician who was the sixth leader of the Soviet Union and the fourth General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, taking office in late 1982 and serving until his death in 1984.

Earlier in his career, Andropov served as the Soviet ambassador to Hungary from 1954 to 1957. During this period, he took part in the suppression of the 1956 Hungarian Uprising. Later under the leadership of Leonid Brezhnev, he was appointed chairman of the KGB on 10 May 1967. After Brezhnev suffered a stroke in 1975 that significantly impaired his ability to govern, Andropov began to increasingly dictate Soviet policymaking alongside Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, Defense Minister Andrei Grechko and Grechko&#x27;s successor, Marshal Dmitry Ustinov.

Upon Brezhnev&#x27;s death on 10 November 1982, Andropov succeeded him as General Secretary and, by extension, as the leader of the Soviet Union. Subsequently, he sought to eliminate corruption and inefficiency in the country by criminalizing truancy in the workplace and investigating longtime officials for violations of party discipline. Under Andropov&#x27;s leadership, the Cold War intensified while the regime struggled to handle the growing crisis in the Soviet economy. His major long-term impact was bringing to the fore a new generation of young reformers as energetic as himself, including Yegor Ligachyov, Nikolai Ryzhkov, and, most importantly, Mikhail Gorbachev. 

Upon suffering kidney failure in February 1983, Andropov&#x27;s health began to deteriorate rapidly. He died aged 69 on 9 February 1984, having led the country for about 15 months.

==Early life==
There has been much contention over Andropov&#x27;s family background. According to the official biography, Andropov was born in Stanitsa Nagutskaya (modern-day Stavropol Krai, Russia) on 15 June 1914. His father, Vladimir Konstantinovich Andropov, was a railway worker of Don Cossack descent who died of typhus in 1919. His mother, Yevgenia Karlovna Fleckenstein (none of the official sources mention her name), was a school teacher who died in 1931. She was born in the Ryazan Governorate into a family of town dwellers and was abandoned on the doorstep of Jewish watchmaker and Finnish citizen Karl Franzevich Fleckenstein, who lived in Moscow. He and his wife, Eudokia Mikhailovna Fleckenstein, adopted and raised her.

Andropov&#x27;s earliest documented name was Grigory Vladimirovich Andropov-Fyodorov which he changed to Yuri Andropov several years later. His original birth certificate disappeared, but it has been established that Andropov was born in Moscow, where his mother worked at a women&#x27;s gymnasium from 1913 to 1917.

On various occasions, Andropov gave different death dates for his mother: 1927, 1929, 1930 and 1931. The story of her adoption was also likely a mystification. In 1937, Andropov was vetted when he applied for Communist Party membership, and it turned out that &quot;the sister of his native maternal grandmother&quot; (whom he called his aunt), who was living with him and who supported the legend of his Ryazan peasant origins, was in fact his nurse, who had been working for Fleckenstein long before Andropov was born.

It was also reported that Andropov&#x27;s mother came from a line of merchants. Karl Fleckenstein was the rich proprietor of a jewellery business which was run by his wife after his death in 1915 when he was mistaken for a German during the infamous anti-German pogrom in Moscow and killed, although Andropov characterized the pogrom as anti-Jewish. The whole family could have been turned into lishentsy and stripped of basic rights had she not abandoned the store after another pogrom in 1917, invented a proletarian background, and left Moscow for the Stavropol Governorate along with Andropov&#x27;s mother.

Andropov gave different versions of his father&#x27;s fate: in one, he divorced his mother soon after his birth; in another he died of illness. The &quot;father&quot; in question, Vladimir Andropov, was in fact his stepfather, who lived and worked in Nagutskaya and died of typhus in 1919. The Fyodorov surname belonged to his second stepfather, Viktor Fyodorov, a machinist&#x27;s assistant turned schoolteacher. Andropov&#x27;s biological father is unknown; he probably died in 1916, a date in Andropov&#x27;s 1932 résumé. During the 1937 vetting, it was reported that his father served as an officer in the Imperial Russian Army. Andropov joined the Communist Party in 1939.

==Early career in the Communist Party==

Andropov was educated at the Rybinsk Water Transport Technical College and graduated in 1936. As a teenager he worked as a loader, a telegraph clerk, and a sailor for the Volga steamship line. At 16, then a member of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League (YCL, or Komsomol), Andropov was a worker in the town of Mozdok in the North Ossetian ASSR.

Andropov became full-time secretary of the YCL of the Rybinsk Water Transport Technical School and was soon promoted to organizer of the YCL Central Committee at the Volodarsky Shipyards in Rybinsk. In 1938, he was elected First Secretary of the Yaroslavl Regional Committee of the YCL and was First Secretary of the Central Committee of Komsomol in the Soviet Karelo-Finnish Republic from 1940 to 1944.

According to his official biography, during World War II Andropov took part in partisan guerrilla activities in Finland although modern researchers have found no trace of his supposed squad. From 1944 onward, he left Komsomol for Communist Party work. Between 1946 and 1951, he studied at the university of Petrozavodsk. In 1947, he was elected Second Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Karelo-Finnish SSR.

In 1951, Andropov was transferred to the CPSU Central Committee. He was appointed an inspector and then the head of a subdepartment of the committee.

==Suppression of the Hungarian Uprising==
In July 1954, Andropov was appointed Ambassador to Hungary. He held this position during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Andropov played a key role in crushing the uprising. He convinced Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev that military intervention was necessary. Andropov is known as &quot;The Butcher of Budapest&quot; for his ruthless suppression of the uprising. Hungarian leaders were arrested and Imre Nagy and others executed.

After these events, Andropov suffered from a &quot;Hungarian complex&quot;, according to historian Christopher Andrew: &quot;He had watched in horror from the windows of his embassy as officers of the hated Hungarian security service [the &quot;Államvédelmi Hatóság&quot; (AVH)] were strung up from lampposts. Andropov remained haunted for the rest of his life by the speed with which an apparently all-powerful Communist one-party state had begun to topple. When other Communist regimes later seemed at risk – in Prague in 1968, in Kabul in 1979, in Warsaw in 1981, he was convinced that, as in Budapest in 1956, only armed force could ensure their survival&quot;.

==Chairmanship of the KGB and Politburo career==

In 1957, Andropov returned to Moscow from Budapest in order to head the Department for Liaison with Communist and Workers&#x27; Parties in Socialist Countries, a position he held until 1967. In 1961, he was elected full member of the CPSU Central Committee and was promoted to the Secretariat of the CPSU Central Committee in 1962. In 1967, he was relieved of his work in the Central Committee apparatus and appointed head of the KGB on Mikhail Suslov&#x27;s recommendation and promoted to candidate member of the Politburo. In 1970, out of concern that the burial place of Joseph and Magda Goebbels and their children would become a shrine to neo-Nazis, Andropov authorized an operation to destroy the remains that were buried in Magdeburg in 1946. The remains were thoroughly burned and crushed, and the ashes thrown into the Biederitz River, a tributary of the nearby Elbe. No proof exists that the Russians ever found Adolf Hitler&#x27;s body, but it is presumed that Hitler and Eva Braun were among the remains as 10 or 11 bodies were exhumed. Andropov gained additional powers in 1973 when he was promoted to full member of the Politburo.

===Crushing the Prague Spring===
During the Prague Spring in 1968, Andropov was the main advocate of taking &quot;extreme measures&quot; against Czechoslovakia. According to classified information released by Vasili Mitrokhin, the &quot;KGB whipped up the fear that Czechoslovakia could fall victim to NATO aggression or to a coup&quot;. At this time, agent Oleg Kalugin reported from Washington that he had gained access to &quot;absolutely reliable documents proving that neither the CIA nor any other agency was manipulating the Czechoslovak reform movement&quot;. His message was destroyed because it contradicted the conspiracy theory Andropov had fabricated. Andropov ordered a number of active measures, collectively known as operation PROGRESS, against Czechoslovak reformers during the Normalization period.

===Suppression of dissidents===
 Throughout his career, Andropov aimed to achieve &quot;the destruction of dissent in all its forms&quot; and insisted that &quot;the struggle for human rights was a part of a wide-ranging imperialist plot to undermine the foundation of the Soviet state&quot;. To this end, he launched a campaign to eliminate all opposition in the USSR through a mixture of mass arrests, involuntary commitments to psychiatric hospitals, and pressure on rights activists to emigrate. These measures were meticulously documented throughout his time as KGB chairman by the underground Chronicle of Current Events, a samizdat publication that was itself finally forced out of existence after its 30 June 1982 issue.

On 3 July 1967, Andropov proposed to establish the KGB&#x27;s Fifth Directorate to deal with the political opposition (ideological counterintelligence). At the end of July, the directorate was established and entered in its files cases of all Soviet dissidents, including Andrei Sakharov and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. In 1968, as KGB chairman, Andropov issued the order &quot;On the tasks of State security agencies in combating the ideological sabotage by the adversary&quot;, calling for struggle against dissidents and their imperialist masters.
After the assassination attempt against Brezhnev in January 1969, Andropov led the interrogation of the captured gunman, Viktor Ivanovich Ilyin. Ilyin was pronounced insane and sent to Kazan Psychiatric Hospital. On 29 April 1969, Andropov submitted to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union an elaborate plan to create a network of psychiatric hospitals to defend the &quot;Soviet Government and socialist order&quot; from dissidents. In January 1970, Andropov submitted an account to his fellow Politburo members of the widespread threat of the mentally ill to the regime&#x27;s stability and security. His proposal to use psychiatry for struggle against dissidents was implemented. As head of the KGB, Andropov was in charge of the widespread deployment of psychiatric repression. According to Yuri Felshtinsky and Boris Gulko, Andropov and the head of the Fifth Directorate, Filipp Bobkov, originated the idea to use psychiatry for punitive purposes.

The repression of dissidents was a big part of Andropov&#x27;s agenda and targeted such prominent figures as Andrei Sakharov and Roy Medvedev. Some believe that Andropov was behind the deaths of Fyodor Kulakov and Pyotr Masherov, the two youngest members of the Soviet leadership. A declassified document revealed that as KGB director, Andropov gave the order to prevent unauthorized gatherings mourning John Lennon.

Beginning in January 1972, Andropov led the implementation of the Soviet détente strategy.

In 1977, Andropov convinced Brezhnev that the Ipatiev House, where Tsar Nicholas II and his family were murdered by Bolshevik revolutionaries during the Russian Civil War, had become a site of pilgrimage for covert monarchists. With the Politburo&#x27;s approval, the house, deemed to be not of &quot;sufficient historical significance&quot;, was demolished in September 1977, less than a year before the murders&#x27; 60th anniversary.

According to Yaakov Kedmi, Andropov was particularly keen to persecute any sign of Zionism in order to distance himself from his Jewish heritage. He was personally responsible for orchestrating the arrest and persecution of Soviet Jewish activist Natan Sharansky.

===Role in the invasion of Afghanistan===
In March 1979, Andropov and the Politburo initially opposed military intervention in Afghanistan. Among their concerns were that the international community would blame the USSR for its &quot;aggression&quot; and that the upcoming SALT II negotiation meeting with U.S. President Jimmy Carter would be derailed. Andropov changed his mind after the assassination of Nur Muhammad Taraki and Hafizullah Amin&#x27;s seizure of power. He became convinced that the CIA had recruited Amin to create a pro-Western expansionist &quot;New Great Ottoman Empire&quot; that would attempt to dominate Soviet Central Asia. Andropov&#x27;s bottom line, &quot;under no circumstances can we lose Afghanistan&quot;, led him and the Politburo to invade Afghanistan on 24 December 1979. The invasion led to the extended Soviet–Afghan War (1979–1989) and a boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympic Games in Moscow by 66 countries, something of concern to Andropov since spring 1979. Some have proposed that the Soviet–Afghan War also played an important role in the Soviet Union&#x27;s dissolution.

===Role in the non-invasion of Poland===

On 10 December 1981, in the face of Poland&#x27;s Solidarity movement, Andropov, Soviet Second Secretary Mikhail Suslov, and Polish First Secretary Wojciech Jaruzelski persuaded Brezhnev that it would be counterproductive for the Soviet Union to invade Poland by repeating the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia to suppress the Prague Spring. This effectively marked the end of the Brezhnev Doctrine. The pacification of Poland was thus left to Jaruzelski, Kiszczak and their Polish forces.

===Promotion of Gorbachev===
From 1980 to 1982, while still chair of the KGB, Andropov opposed plans to occupy Poland after the emergence of the Solidarity movement and promoted reform-minded party cadres, including Mikhail Gorbachev. Andropov was the longest-serving KGB chairman and did not resign as head of the KGB until May 1982, when he was again promoted to the Secretariat to succeed Mikhail Suslov as secretary responsible for ideological affairs.

==Leader of the Soviet Union (1982–1984)==

Two days after Brezhnev&#x27;s death, on 12 November 1982, Andropov was elected general secretary of the CPSU, the first former head of the KGB to become general secretary. His appointment was received in the West with apprehension in view of his roles in the KGB and in Hungary. At the time his personal background was a mystery in the West, with major newspapers printing detailed profiles of him that were inconsistent and in several cases fabricated.

Andropov divided responsibilities in the Politburo with his chief deputy, Konstantin Chernenko. Andropov took control of organizing the work of the Politburo, supervising national defense, supervising the main issues of domestic and foreign policy and foreign trade, and making leadership assignments in the top ranks of the party and the government. Chernenko handled espionage, KGB, the Interior Ministry, party organs, ideology, organizational matters, propaganda, culture, science, and higher education. He was also given charge of the Central Committee. It was far too much for Chernenko to handle, and other Politburo members were not given major assignments.

===Domestic policy===

====Economy====
At home, Andropov attempted to improve the USSR&#x27;s economy by increasing its workforce&#x27;s efficiency. He cracked down on Soviet laborers&#x27; lack of discipline by decreeing the arrest of absentee employees and penalties for tardiness. For the first time, the facts about economic stagnation and obstacles to scientific progress were made available to the public and open to criticism. Furthermore, Andropov gave select industries greater autonomy from state regulations and enabled factory managers to retain control over more of their profits. Such policies resulted in a 4% rise in industrial output and increased investment in new technologies such as robotics.

Despite such reforms, Andropov refused to consider any changes that sought to dispense with the Planned economy introduced under Joseph Stalin. In his memoirs, Gorbachev wrote that when Andropov was the leader, Gorbachev and Gosplan chairman Nikolai Ryzhkov asked him for access to real budget figures. &quot;You are asking too much&quot;, Andropov responded. &quot;The budget is off limits to you.&quot;

====Anti-corruption campaign====
In contrast to Brezhnev&#x27;s policy of avoiding conflicts and dismissals, Andropov began to fight violations of party, state and labor discipline, which led to significant personnel changes during an anti-corruption campaign against many of Brezhnev&#x27;s cronies. During his 15 months in office, Andropov dismissed 18 ministers and 37 first secretaries of obkoms, kraikoms and Central Committees of Communist Parties of Soviet Republics, and criminal cases against high-level party and state officials were started. Biographers including Solovyov and Klepikova and Zhores Medvedev have discussed the complex possibilities underlying the motivations of anti-corruption campaigning in the Soviet Union during the 1970s and early 1980s: it is true that Andropov fought corruption for moral, ethical, ascetic, and ideological reasons, but it was also an effective way for party members from the police and security organizations to defeat competitors for power at the party&#x27;s senior levels. Thus Andropov himself, as well as such protégés as Eduard Shevardnadze, could advance their power by the same efforts that also promised to be better for the country in terms of justice, economic performance, and even defense readiness (which depended on economic performance). Part of the complexity is that in the Brezhnev era, corruption was pervasive and implicitly tolerated (though officially denied), and many a member of the police and security organizations participated in it to various degrees, but only those organizations had access to the power to measure it and monitor its details. In such an environment, anti-corruption campaigning is a way for police and security people to appear to be cleaning up villains&#x27; malfeasance and coincidentally increasing their own power, when in fact one set of antiheroes may be defeating another set in a power struggle.

===Foreign policy===

Andropov faced a series of foreign policy crises: the hopeless situation of the Soviet army in Afghanistan, threatened revolt in Poland, growing animosity with China, the polarization threat of war in the Middle East, and civil strife in Ethiopia and South Africa. The most critical threat was the &quot;Second Cold War&quot; U.S. President Ronald Reagan launched, and the specific attack on rolling back what he called the &quot;Evil Empire&quot;. Reagan used American economic power and Soviet economic weakness to escalate massive spending on the Cold War, emphasizing technology that Moscow lacked. The main response was to raise the Soviet military budget to 70% of the total budget and supply billions of dollars of military aid to Syria, Iraq, Libya, South Yemen, the Palestine Liberation Organization, Cuba, and North Korea. That included tanks and armored troop carriers, hundreds of fighter planes, anti-aircraft systems, artillery systems, and other high-tech equipment of which the USSR was its allies&#x27; main supplier. Andropov&#x27;s main goal was to avoid an open war.

In foreign policy, the conflict in Afghanistan continued even though Andropov, who now felt the invasion was a mistake, half-heartedly explored options for a negotiated withdrawal. Andropov&#x27;s rule was also marked by deterioration of relations with the United States. During a much-publicized &quot;walk in the woods&quot; with Soviet dignitary Yuli Kvitsinsky, American diplomat Paul Nitze suggested a compromise for reducing nuclear missiles in Europe on both sides that the Politburo ignored. Kvitsinsky later wrote that, despite his efforts, the Soviet leadership was not interested in compromise, instead calculating that peace movements in the West would force the Americans to capitulate. On 8 March 1983, Reagan called the Soviet Union an &quot;evil empire&quot;. On 23 March, he announced the Strategic Defense Initiative. Reagan claimed this research program into ballistic missile defense was &quot;consistent with our obligations under the ABM Treaty&quot;. Andropov dismissed this claim, saying, &quot;It is time they [Washington] stopped ... search[ing] for the best ways of unleashing nuclear war. ... Engaging in this is not just irresponsible. It is insane&quot;.
In August 1983, Andropov made an announcement that the USSR would stop all work on space-based weapons. One of his most notable acts as leader of the Soviet Union was in response to a letter from a 10-year-old American child, Samantha Smith, inviting her to the Soviet Union. She came, but he was too ill to meet with her, thus revealing his grave condition to the world. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union suspended talks with the U.S. on intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe in November 1983, and by the end of the year the Soviets had broken off all arms control negotiations.

Massive bad publicity worldwide came when Soviet fighters shot down a civilian jet liner, Korean Air Flight KAL-007, which carried 269 passengers and crew. It had strayed over the Soviet Union on 1 September 1983 on its scheduled route from Anchorage, Alaska, to Seoul, South Korea. Andropov kept secret that the Soviet Union held in its possession the black box from KAL 007 that proved the pilot had made a typographical error when entering data in the automatic pilot. The Soviet air defence system was unprepared to deal with a civilian airliner, and the shooting down was a matter of following orders without question. Instead of admitting an accident, Soviet media proclaimed a brave decision to meet a Western provocation. Together with the low credibility created by the poor explanation of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, the episode demonstrated an inability to deal with public relations crises; the propaganda system was useful only for people and states aligned with the Soviet Union. Both crises were escalated by technological and organizational failures, compounded by human error.

==Death and funeral==

In February 1983, Andropov suffered total kidney failure. In August 1983, he entered Moscow&#x27;s Central Clinical Hospital, where he would spend the rest of his life.

In late January 1984, Andropov&#x27;s health deteriorated rapidly. Due to growing toxicity in his blood, he had periods of falling into unconsciousness. He died on 9 February 1984 at 16:50, aged 69. Few of the top Soviet leaders learned of his death on that day. According to the Soviet post-mortem medical report, Andropov suffered from several medical conditions: interstitial nephritis, nephrosclerosis, residual hypertension and diabetes, worsened by chronic kidney deficiency.
A four-day period of mourning across the USSR was announced. Syria declared seven days of mourning; Cuba declared four days of mourning; India declared three days of mourning; Bulgaria, North Korea and Zimbabwe declared two days of mourning; Czechoslovakia and Costa Rica declared one day of mourning. Andropov had a state funeral in Red Square, in a service attended by numerous foreign leaders, such as U.S. Vice President George H. W. Bush, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Italian President Sandro Pertini, East German First Secretary Erich Honecker, Polish First Secretary Wojciech Jaruzelski, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Cuban President Fidel Castro, and Irish President Patrick Hillery. Eulogists were Chernenko, Ustinov, Gromyko, Georgi Markov (head of the Union of Soviet Writers), and Ivan Senkin (First Secretary of the Karelian Regional Committee of the CPSU). Andropov was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, in one of the 12 tombs between the Lenin Mausoleum and the Kremlin wall.

Andropov was succeeded by Konstantin Chernenko, who seemed to mirror Andropov&#x27;s tenure. Chernenko had already been afflicted with severe health problems when he ascended to the USSR&#x27;s top spot, and served even less time in office (13 months). Like Andropov, Chernenko spent much of his time hospitalized, and also died in office, in March 1985. Chernenko was succeeded by Mikhail Gorbachev, who implemented perestroika and glasnost policies to reform the Soviet Union politically and economically. On 26 December 1991, the USSR was dissolved.

==Personal life==

Andropov lived at 26 Kutuzovsky Prospekt, the same building in which Suslov and Brezhnev lived.

Tatyana and Andropov had two children, Igor and Irina. Igor joined the USSR Ministry of Foreign Affairs and served as ambassador to Greece.

==Legacy==
Andropov&#x27;s legacy remains the subject of much debate in Russia and elsewhere among scholars and in the popular media. He remains the focus of television documentaries and popular nonfiction, particularly at important anniversaries. As KGB head, Andropov was ruthless against dissent, and author David Remnick, who covered the Soviet Union for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in the 1980s, called him &quot;profoundly corrupt, a beast&quot;. Alexander Yakovlev, later an advisor to Gorbachev and the ideologist of perestroika, said: &quot;In a way I always thought Andropov was the most dangerous of all of them, simply because he was smarter than the rest.&quot; But Andropov himself recalled Yakovlev back to high office in Moscow in 1983 after a ten-year exile as ambassador to Canada after attacking Russian chauvinism. Yakovlev was also a close colleague of Andropov associate KGB General Yevgeny Primakov, later Prime Minister of Russia. Andropov began to follow a trend of replacing elderly officials with considerably younger ones.
According to his former subordinate Securitate general Ion Mihai Pacepa:

In the West, if Andropov is remembered at all, it is for his brutal suppression of political dissidence at home and for his role in planning the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia. By contrast, the leaders of the former Warsaw Pact intelligence community, when I was one of them, looked up to Andropov as the man who substituted the KGB for the Communist party in governing the Soviet Union, and who was the godfather of Russia&#x27;s new era of deception operations aimed at improving the badly damaged image of Soviet rulers in the West.

Despite Andropov&#x27;s hard-line stance in Hungary and the numerous banishments and intrigues for which he was responsible as head of the KGB, many commentators regard him as a reformer, especially in comparison with the stagnation and corruption of Brezhnev&#x27;s later years. A &quot;throwback to a tradition of Leninist asceticism&quot;, Andropov was appalled by the corruption of Brezhnev&#x27;s regime, and ordered investigations and arrests of the most flagrant abusers. The investigations were so frightening that several members of Brezhnev&#x27;s circle &quot;shot, gassed or otherwise did away with themselves.&quot; He was generally regarded as inclined to more gradual and constructive reform than was Gorbachev; most of the speculation centers on whether Andropov would have reformed the USSR in a manner that did not result in its eventual dissolution.

The Western media generally favored Andropov, but the short time he spent as leader, much of it in ill health, leaves debaters few concrete indications as to the nature of an extended rule. The 2002 Tom Clancy novel &quot;Red Rabbit&quot; focuses heavily on Andropov during his tenure of KGB chief, when his health was slightly better. It mirrors his secrecy in that British and American intelligence know little about him, not even able to confirm he was married. The novel also depicts Andropov as a fan of Marlboros and starka vodka, almost never available to ordinary Soviet citizens.

==Attitudes toward Andropov==
===Leadership persona and strategy===
Various people who knew Andropov well, including Vladimir Medvedev, Aleksandr Chuchyalin, Vladimir Kryuchkov and Roy Medvedev, remembered him for his politeness, calmness, unselfishness, patience, intelligence and exceptionally sharp memory. According to Chuchyalin, while working at the Kremlin, Andropov would read about 600 pages a day and remember everything he read. Andropov read English literature and could communicate in Finnish, English and German.

Historian Moshe Lewin characterizes Andropov during his brief tenure as Soviet leader as &quot;a politician interested in intellectual issues, but who was also a realist&quot; and states that &quot;Andropov was free of the habitual arrogance of Soviet leaders, who considered their empire invulnerable&quot;. This led him to seek dialogue with social democrats in Western countries instead of only building relationships with fellow Marxist-Leninists. Within the party elites, he actively encouraged disagreements and debates, while also preserving the image of ideological unity towards the outside. Despite his KGB connections and his repressive tendencies, Andropov mused over ways to encourage &quot;forms of political as well as economic pluralism&quot;. Vladislav Zubok even states that &quot;The idea of renovating the Soviet Union originated not with Mikhail Gorbachev, but with his mentor Yuri Andropov&quot;, who was in favor of &quot;controlled, conservative reforms&quot;.

===Attitudes among dissidents===
According to Russian historian Nikita Petrov, &quot;He was a typical Soviet jailer who violated human rights. Andropov headed the organisation which persecuted the most remarkable people of our country.&quot; According to Petrov, it was a shame for the USSR that a persecutor of intelligentsia and of freedom of thought became leader of the country.

Roy Medvedev stated that the year that Andropov spent in power was memorable for increasing repression against dissidents. During most of his KGB career, Andropov crushed dissident movements, isolated people in psychiatric hospitals, imprisoned them, and deported them. According to political scientist Georgy Arbatov, Andropov is responsible for many injustices in the 1970s and early 1980s: deportations, political arrests, persecuting dissidents, the abuse of psychiatry, and notorious cases such as the persecution of academician Andrei Sakharov. According to Dmitri Volkogonov and Harold Shukman, Andropov approved the numerous trials of human rights activists such as Andrei Amalrik, Vladimir Bukovsky, Viacheslav Chornovil, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, Alexander Ginzburg, Natalya Gorbanevskaya, Petro Grigorenko, and Anatoly Sharansky.

According to Natalya Gorbanevskaya, after Andropov came to power the dissident movement went into decline, not on its own but because it was strangled. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, repression was most severe; many people were arrested a second time and sentenced to longer terms. The camp regime was not strict but specific, and when Andropov became General Secretary, he introduced an Article under which violations of camp regime resulted in a punishment cell and an additional term up to three years. For two or three remarks a person could be sent to another camp with non-political criminals. In those years, there were many deaths in camps from disease and lack of medical care.

===Attitudes among Russian leaders===
In a message read at the opening of a new exhibition dedicated to Andropov, Vladimir Putin called him &quot;a man of talent with great abilities.&quot; Putin has praised Andropov&#x27;s &quot;honesty and uprightness&quot;.

<text>Autocracy is a system of government in which absolute power is held by the head of state and government, known as an autocrat. It includes some forms of monarchy and all forms of dictatorship, while it is contrasted with democracy and feudalism. Various definitions of autocracy exist. They may restrict autocracy to cases where power is held by a single individual, or they may define autocracy in a way that includes a group of rulers who wield absolute power. The autocrat has total control over the exercise of civil liberties within the autocracy, choosing under what circumstances they may be exercised, if at all. Governments may also blend elements of autocracy and democracy, forming an anocracy. The concept of autocracy has been recognized in political philosophy since ancient history.

Autocrats maintain power through political repression of any opposition and co-optation of other influential or powerful members of society. The general public is controlled through indoctrination and propaganda, and an autocracy may attempt to legitimize itself in the eyes of the public through appeals to political ideology, religion, birthright, or foreign hostility. Some autocracies establish legislatures, unfair elections, or show trials to further exercise control while presenting the appearance of democracy. The only limits to autocratic rule are practical considerations in preserving the regime. Autocrats must retain control over the nation&#x27;s elites and institutions for their will to be exercised, but they must also prevent any other individual or group from gaining significant power or influence. Internal challenges are the most significant threats faced by autocrats, as they may lead to a coup d&#x27;état.

Autocracy was among the earliest forms of government. It began as despotism, which existed throughout the ancient world in the form of chiefdoms, city-states, and empires. Monarchy was the predominant form of autocracy for most of history. Dictatorship became more common in the 19th century, beginning with the &quot;caudillos&quot; in Latin America and the empires of Napoleon and Napoleon III in Europe. Totalitarian dictatorships developed in the 20th century with the advent of fascist and communist states. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, most dictatorships have been characterized as authoritarian rather than totalitarian.

==Etymology and use==
&quot;Autocracy&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek (Greek: ; &quot;self&quot;) and (Greek: ; &quot;power, might&quot;). This became the Hellenistic/Byzantine Greek word (Greek: ) and the Latin , both of which were titles for the Roman emperor. This was adopted in Old Russian as and then modern Russian as . In the 18th century, the title for the Russian emperor was translated to and then in French, while it was translated to and then , &quot;Selbstherrscher&quot; or &quot;Alleinherrscher&quot; in German. These terms were eventually used to refer to autocratic rulers in general. The term has since developed a negative connotation.

== Political structure ==

Many attempts have been made to define the political structure of autocracy. It traditionally entails a single unrestrained ruler, known as an autocrat, though unrestrained non-democratic rule by a group may also be defined as autocratic. Autocracy is distinguished from other forms of government by the power of the autocrat to unilaterally repress the civil liberties of the people and to choose what liberties they may exercise. It is distinct from democracy and feudalism, and modern autocracy is often defined as any non-democratic government. As with all forms of government, autocracy has no clearly defined boundaries, and it may intersect with other forms of government. Though autocracy usually encompasses an entire country, it can sometimes take place at subnational or local levels, even in countries with a more democratic government, if the national government has limited control over a specific area or its political conflicts.

Autocracies impose few to no limits on the power of the autocrat, and any formal institutions that exist create only limited accountability. To maintain power, an autocrat must have the support of elites that hold influence in the country and assist the autocrat in carrying out their will. The amount of direct control that an autocrat wields in practice may vary. As an autocratic government solidifies its rule, it develops stronger institutions to carry out the autocrat&#x27;s will. These institutions are necessary for maintaining control and extracting value from the state, but they can also serve as checks on the autocrat. Autocrats must also balance the affiliation that regional elites have over their jurisdiction; too little can prevent effective rule, while too much may cause the elite to favor the region&#x27;s interests over the autocrat&#x27;s. Some autocracies incorporate an elected legislature that has a limited ability to check the power of the autocrat, though these are not usually formed through free and fair elections. These legislatures may also be prone to corruption and can be influenced by the autocrat in exchange for preferential treatment. Other institutions, such as an independent judiciary or an active civil society, may also limit the autocrat&#x27;s power.

Some autocracies emphasize a ruling family rather than a single autocrat. This has been the case of most monarchies. Such arrangements allow for royal intermarriage, which can join autocracies together through dynastic unions. Personalist dictatorships may also give significance to the ruling family through a cult of personality, such as the Kim family of North Korea.

==Origin and development==
=== Formation ===
The earliest autocracies, such as chiefdoms, formed where there was previously no centralized government. The initial development of an autocracy is attributed to its efficiency over anarchy, as it provides security and negates internal divisions. Mancur Olson introduced the term &quot;stationary bandits&quot; to describe the method of control associated with autocracy, as opposed to the &quot;roaming bandits&quot; that dominate anarchic society. Under this definition, autocrats as stationary bandits see long-term investment in the society that they exploit through taxation and other seizure of resources, as opposed to the bandits in stateless societies that have no incentive to improve society. This creates a Pareto efficiency in which both the autocrat and the subjects benefit over the alternative.

Douglass North, John Joseph Wallis, and Barry R. Weingast describe autocracies as natural states that arise from this need to monopolize violence. In contrast to Olson, these scholars understand the early state not as a single ruler, but as an organization formed by many actors. They describe the process of autocratic state formation as a bargaining process among individuals with access to violence. For them, these individuals form a dominant coalition that grants each other privileges such as the access to resources. As violence reduces the economic rents, members of the dominant coalition have incentives to cooperate and to avoid fighting. A limited access to privileges is necessary to avoid competition among the members of the dominant coalition, who then will credibly commit to cooperate and will form the state.

There is great variance in the types of states that become autocratic. Neither a state&#x27;s size, its military strength, its economic success, nor its cultural attributes significantly affect whether it is likely to be autocratic. Autocracy is more likely to form in heterogeneous populations, as there is greater inequality and less social cohesion. Autocracies formed under these conditions are often more volatile for the same reasons.

=== Stability and succession ===

Autocracies face challenges to their authority from several fronts, including the citizenry, political opposition, and internal disloyalty from elites. As autocrats must share their power with the state&#x27;s elites to see their will carried out, these elites are the greatest threat to the autocrat. Most autocratic governments are overthrown by a coup, and historically most have been succeeded by another autocratic government, though a trend toward democracy developed in 20th century Europe. These new governments are commonly a different type of autocracy or a weaker variant of the same type.

While popular support for revolution is often necessary to overthrow an autocratic government, most revolts are accompanied by internal support from elites who believe that it is no longer in their interest to support the autocrat. Overthrow of an autocratic government purely through popular revolt is virtually nonexistent throughout history, but popular support for democracy is a significant indicator of challenges to autocratic rule. Modernization and increased wealth are often associated with stronger support for democracy, though failing to provide these things also reduces support for the autocratic regime. Popular revolt is most likely to occur during periods of reform. Government reform can provide an impetus for stronger opposition, especially when it does not meet expectations, and it can weaken the centralization of power through poor implementation. When revolt appears likely, an autocrat may grant civil rights, redistribute wealth, or abdicate from power entirely to avoid the threat of violence.

Some autocracies use hereditary succession in which a set of rules determines who will be the next autocrat. Otherwise, a successor may be handpicked, either by the autocrat or by another governmental body. Pre-determined successors are incentivized to overthrow and replace the autocrat, creating a dilemma for autocrats wishing to choose a successor. The threat of overthrow is greater for appointed successors over hereditary successors, as hereditary successors are often younger and less influential. Other autocracies have no appointed successor, and a power struggle will take place upon the death or removal of the autocrat. These methods of succession are a common distinction between monarchical rule and dictatorial rule; monarchies use an established system of succession such as hereditary succession, while dictatorships do not. Autocratic rule is most unstable during succession from one autocrat to another. Orders of succession allow for more peaceful transition of power, but it prevents meaningful vetting of successors for competence or fortitude. When rule passes between autocrats, the incoming autocrat often inherits an established bureaucracy. This bureaucracy facilitates the transfer of power, as the new ruler gains immediate control over the nation without having to conquer its people or win their popular support.

=== Legitimacy ===
Autocrats may claim that they have legitimacy under a legal framework, or they may exert influence purely through force. Opinion on whether an autocratic government is legitimate can vary, even among its own population. An autocracy&#x27;s approach to legitimacy can be affected by recognition from other nations. Widely accepted autocratic governments are more able to convince their own populations of their legitimacy. Less widely accepted autocracies may rally internal support by attributing their lack of recognition to malevolent foreign efforts, such as American imperialism or Zionism.

Historically, the most common claim of legitimacy is birthright in an autocracy that uses hereditary succession. Theocratic governments appeal to religion to justify their rule, arguing that religious leaders must also be political leaders. Other autocrats may use similar claims of divine authority to justify their rule, often in absolute monarchy. This includes the Mandate of Heaven in ancient China and the divine right of kings in 17th century England and France. When an autocratic government has a state ideology, this may be used to justify the autocrat&#x27;s rule. This is most common in communist or ethnonationalist governments. Autocracies with unfair elections will cite election results to prove that the autocrat has a mandate to rule. Some autocracies will use practical considerations to legitimise their rule, arguing that they are necessary to provide basic needs to the population.

== Types ==
Autocracy encompasses most non-democratic forms of government, including dictatorships, monarchies, and dominant-party regimes. Monarchies were common in medieval Europe, but in the modern era dictatorship is the most common form of government globally.

Autocratic governments are classified as totalitarian when they engage in direct control of citizens&#x27; lives, or as authoritarian when they do not. Totalitarian governments do not allow political or cultural pluralism. Instead, citizens are expected to devote themselves to a single ideological vision and demonstrate their support of the state ideology through political engagement. Totalitarian governments are revolutionary, seeking radically to reform society, and they often engage in terror against groups that do not comply with the state&#x27;s vision. Totalitarianism is associated with communist states and Nazi Germany. Authoritarian governments maintain control of a nation purely through repression and controlled opposition rather than mandated adherence to a state ideology. These include most traditional monarchies, military dictatorships, theocracies, and dominant party states.

An absolute autocracy may be referred to as despotism, in which the autocrat rules purely through personal control without any meaningful institutions. These were most common in pre-industrial societies, when large bureaucracies had not yet become standard in government. Sultanism is a type of personalist dictatorship in which a ruling family directly integrates itself into the state through a cult of personality, where it maintains control purely through rewards for allies and force against enemies. In these regimes, there is no guiding ideology or legal system, and the state serves only to bring about the leader&#x27;s own personal enrichment. Other descriptors, such as tyranny and absolutism, may also be associated with variations of autocracy.

Though autocracies often restrict civil and political rights, some may allow limited exercise of some rights. These autocracies grant moderate representation to political opponents and allow exercise of some civil rights, though less than those associated with democracy. These are contrasted with closed autocracies, which do not permit the exercise of these rights. Several forms of semi-autocratic government have been defined in which governments blend elements of democracy and autocracy. These include limited autocracy, semi-autocracy, liberal autocracy, semi-liberal autocracy, anocracy, and electoral autocracy. These governments may begin as democratic governments and then become autocratic as the elected leader seizes control over the nation&#x27;s institutions and electoral process. Conversely, autocratic governments may transition to democracy through a period of semi-autocratic rule.

== History ==
=== Early history ===

Autocracy has been the primary form of government for most of human history. One of the earliest forms of government was the chiefdom that developed in tribal societies, which date back to the Neolithic. Chiefdoms are regional collections of villages ruled over by tribal chief. They are an emergent form of governance, originating from societies that previously lacked a centralized authority. Historical chiefs often held only tenuous power over the chiefdom, but they trended towards autocracy as heterarchical governance was replaced with hierarchical governance.

Early states were formed by warlords ruling over conquered territory. The first states were the city-states of Mesopotamia, which first developed around the 35th century BCE. These early states were ruled by kings who were both political and religious leaders. These were followed by the first empire, the Akkadian Empire, when they were conquered by Sargon of Akkad in the 24th century BCE. The blending of autocratic rule with religious significance continued under the Akkadian Empire, as the king Naram-Sin of Akkad was the first of several kings to be recognized as a god over the following centuries. Ancient Egypt also existed as an autocratic government for most of its early history, first developing states at the end of the fourth millennium BCE.

China has been subject to autocratic rule almost without interruption since its ancient feudal society was replaced by the Qin dynasty in 221 BCE, and even its feudal government had stronger elements of autocracy than other instances of feudalism. The early Chinese philosophy of Confucianism emphasized the importance of benevolent autocratic rule to maintain order, and this philosophy heavily influenced future Chinese thought.

City-states in Ancient Greece and the Etruscan civilization were often ruled by tyrants, though myth and historical revisionism later re-imagined these tyrants as kings with hereditary succession. The Roman Republic introduced the concept of the Roman dictator who would be temporarily invested with unchecked power to restore stability during periods of crisis. This temporary dictatorship was eventually subverted by Julius Caesar when he became dictator for life in 44 BCE, ending the Roman Republic and ushering the creation of the autocratic Roman Empire.

Several early military dictatorships formed in East Asia during the post-classical era. These include the rule of the Goguryeo kingdom by Yeon Gaesomun in 642, the Goryeo military regime beginning in 1170, and the shogunate in Japan between the 12th and 19th centuries.

Parliamentary monarchies became common in the 13th century as monarchs sought larger advising bodies that were representative of the kingdom. European nations moved away from feudalism and towards centralized monarchy as the primary form of government in the 14th century.

=== Modern era ===

Absolutism became more common in European monarchies at the onset of the 16th century as the continent struggled with weak leadership and religious conflict. Legislatures during this period were often tailored to enforce the king&#x27;s will but not challenge it. This was sometimes justified through the divine right of kings, particularly in the kingdoms of England and France.

The French Revolution marked a significant shift in the perception of dictatorship as a form of tyrannical rule, as revolutionaries justified their actions as a means of combatting tyranny. In Europe, the original forms of dictatorship were Bonapartism, a form of monarchism that rejected feudalism, and Caesarism, imperial rule reminiscent of Julius Caesar. These were primarily used to define the First and Second French Empires. European monarchies moved away from autocracy in the 19th century as legislatures increased in power. In 19th century Latin America, regional rulers known as &quot;caudillos&quot; seized power in several nations as early examples of dictators.

The 19th and 20th centuries brought about the decline of traditional monarchies in favor of modern states, many of which developed as autocracies. The upheaval caused by World War I resulted in a broad shift of governance across Europe, and many nations moved away from traditional monarchies. Most European monarchs were stripped of their powers to become constitutional monarchs, or they were displaced entirely in favor of republics. Totalitarianism first developed as a form of autocracy during the interwar period. It seized power in many of these republics, particularly during the Great Depression. This saw the establishment of fascist, communist, and military dictatorships throughout Europe.

The communist state first developed as a new form of autocracy following the Russian Revolution. This type of autocratic government enforced totalitarian control over its citizens through a mass party said to represent the citizens. While other forms of European dictatorship were dissolved after World War II, communism was strengthened and became the basis of several dictatorships in Eastern Europe. Communist states became the primary model for autocratic government in the late-20th century, and many non-communist autocratic regimes replicated the communist style of government.

The decline in autocracy across Western Europe affected autocratic government elsewhere in the world through colonization. Societies without a state were readily colonized by European nations and subsequently adopted democracy and parliamentary government after it became common in Europe. Regions with historically strong autocratic states were able to resist European colonization or otherwise went unchanged, allowing autocracy to be preserved.

The strength of autocracy in global politics was significantly reduced at the end of the Cold War with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, but it saw a resurgence over the following decades through regional powers such as China, Iran, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. The fall of totalitarian regimes led to authoritarianism becoming the predominant form of autocracy in the 21st century.

== Political activity ==

Political repression is the primary method by which autocrats preserve the regime and prevent the loss of power. This repression may take place implicitly by coercing and intimidating potential opposition, or it may involve direct violence. Autocratic governments also engage in co-optation, in which influential figures are provided benefits by the regime in exchange for their support. Coercing these elites is usually more efficient for the autocrat than intimidating them through violence. Political parties are a common method of co-optation and coercion, as they provide a mechanism to control members of the government, initiate new members, and discourage a military coup. Autocratic governments controlled through a political party last longer on average than other autocratic governments.

Control over the public is maintained through indoctrination and propaganda. Autocratic governments enjoy similar levels of public support to democratic governments, and a state&#x27;s status as autocratic is not a significant indicator in whether it is supported by its citizens. Autocrats often appeal to the people by supporting a specific political, ethnic, or religious movement.

The different forms of autocratic government create significant variance in their foreign policy. Overall, autocratic governments are more likely to go to war than democratic governments, as citizens are not part of the selectorate to which autocrats are accountable. Totalitarian autocracies have historically engaged in militarism and expansionism after consolidating power, particularly fascist governments. This allows the autocracy to spread its state ideology, and the existence of foreign adversaries allows the autocrat to rally internal support.

Autocratic regimes in the 21st century have departed from the historical precedent of direct rule in favor of institutions that resemble those of democratic governments. This may include controlled liberties for citizens such as the formation of opposition parties to participate in unfair elections. Elections provide several benefits to autocratic regimes, allowing for a venue to restrain or appease the opposition and creating a method to transfer power without violent conflict. Many autocrats also institute show trials to carry out political repression rather than carrying out direct purges. This may be done to more publicly discourage future dissidents. Prior to this trend, autocratic elections rarely invited public participation. They were instead used by elites to choose a leader amongst themselves, such as in an electoral monarchy. The creation of a constitution is another common measure used by autocrats to stay in power; as they are able to draft the constitution unilaterally, it can be tailored to suit their rule.

== Study and evaluation ==

Autocratic government has been central to political theory since the development of Ancient Greek political philosophy. Despite its historical prominence, autocracy has not been widely recognized as its own political theory in the way that democracy has. Autocratic government is generally considered to be less desirable than democratic government. Reasons for this include its proclivity for corruption and violence as well as its lack of efficiency and its weakness in promoting liberty and transparency.

Historically, data on the operation of autocratic government has been limited, preventing detailed study. Study of postcolonial autocracy in Africa has been particularly limited, as these governments were less likely to keep detailed records of their activities relative to other governments at the time, and they frequently destroyed the records that did exist. Study of citizen support for autocratic government relative to democratic government has also been infrequent, and most studies conducted in this area have been limited to East Asia. Collection of information on autocratic regimes has improved in the 21st century, allowing for more detailed analysis.

Autocratic government has been found to have effects on a country&#x27;s politics, including its government&#x27;s structure and bureaucracy, long after it democratizes. Comparisons between regions have found disparities in citizen attitudes, policy preferences, and political engagement depending on whether it had been subject to autocracy, even in different regions within the same country. Citizens of postcommunist nations are more likely to distrust government and free markets, directly hindering the long-term economic prosperity of these nations. Xenophobia is generally more common in post-autocratic nations, and voters in these nations are more likely to vote for far-right or far-left political parties.

Many democracy indices have been developed to measure how democratic or authoritarian countries are, such as the Polity data series, the Freedom in the World report, and the Varieties of Democracy indices. These indices measure various attributes of a government&#x27;s actions and its citizens&#x27; rights to sort democracies and autocracies. These attributes might include enfranchisement, freedom of expression, freedom of information, separation of powers, or free and fair elections, among others. Both the choice in attributes and the method of measuring them are subjective, and they are defined individually be each index. Despite this, different democracy indices generally produce similar results. Most discrepancies come from the measurement of anocratic governments that blend democratic and autocratic traits.

The concepts of tyranny and despotism as distinct modes of government were abandoned in the 19th century in favor of more specific typologies. Modern typology of autocratic regimes originates from the work of Juan Linz in the mid-20th century, when his division of democracy, authoritarianism, and totalitarianism became accepted. The first general theory of autocracy that defined it independently of other systems was created by Gordon Tullock in 1974 through applied public choice theory. At the end of the Cold War, Francis Fukuyama&#x27;s theory of the end of history became popular among political scientists. This theory proposed that autocratic government was approaching a permanent decline to be replaced by liberal democracy. This theory was largely abandoned after the increase in autocratic government over the following decades. In the 2010s, the concept of &quot;autocracy promotion&quot; became influential in the study of autocracy, proposing that some governments have sought to establish autocratic rule in foreign nations, though subsequent studies have found little evidence to support that such efforts are as widespread or successful as originally thought.

<text>The cornett (, ) is a lip-reed wind instrument that dates from the Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque periods, popular from 1500 to 1650. Although smaller and larger sizes were made in both straight and curved forms, surviving cornetts are mostly curved, built in the treble size from in length, usually described as in G. The note sounded with all finger-holes covered is A, which can be lowered a further whole tone to G by slackening the embouchure. The name &quot;cornett&quot; comes from the Italian &quot;cornetto&quot;, meaning &quot;small horn&quot;.

It was used in performances by professional musicians for both state and liturgical music, especially accompanying choral music. It also featured in popular music in &quot;alta capella&quot; or loud wind ensembles. British organologist Anthony Baines wrote that the cornett &quot;was praised in the very terms that were to be bestowed upon the oboe [...]: it could be sounded as loud as a trumpet and as soft as a recorder, and its tone approached that of the human voice more nearly than that of any other instrument.&quot; It was popular in Germany, where trumpet-playing was restricted to professional trumpet guild members. As well, the mute cornett variant was a quiet instrument, playing &quot;gentle, soft and sweet.&quot;

The cornett is not to be confused with the modern cornet, a valved brass instrument with a separate origin and development. The English spelling &quot;cornet&quot;, which had applied to the cornett since about 1400, was in around 1836 transferred to the &quot;cornet à pistons&quot;, the predecessor of the modern cornet. Subsequently, &quot;cornett&quot; became the modern English spelling of the older instrument.

==Construction==

Pipes as short as the cornett are only able to play two or three notes of the harmonic series when sounded as an end-blown lip-reed instrument. The common treble or curved cornett then, can play A and the next octave A; a trumpeter might be able to reach the next E. Other short trumpets had this issue, including King Tut&#x27;s Trumpet, capable of only playing two notes without a modern mouthpiece.

The instrument has features of both the trumpet and a woodwind instrument. Like the trumpet, the cornett has a small cup-shaped mouthpiece, where the instrument is sounded with the player&#x27;s lips. Like many woodwind instruments, it has fingered tone holes (and rarely, keys) to determine the pitch by shortening the vibrating air column, although pitch can also be adjusted by varying the tension of the player&#x27;s embochure.

The cornett has six finger holes and, like the recorder, a single thumb hole on the opposite side. Together these allow the instrument to play a diatonic scale. A small number of cornetts were built with seven holes, and French instruments often lacked a thumbhole. By using &quot;cross fingering&quot; and by varying the embouchure tension, the instrument can play a chromatic scale. A player in 1738 who mastered the cross-fingering and lip tension was documented to have reached 27 notes and half notes. In comparison, Praetorius gave cornetts credit for achieving 15 notes, before players used techniques to expand the range.

The cornett has a conical bore, narrow at the mouthpiece and widening towards the bell. The ordinary curved treble cornett is made by splitting a length of wood, usually walnut, boxwood or other tonewoods like plum, cherry or pear. The bore is carved out and the two halves then glued back together, and the outside planed to an octagonal cross section. The whole is then further bound tightly in thin black leather or parchment. A small number of surviving instruments were made from one straight piece, bored on a lathe, and then bent into a curve with steam. The finger holes and thumb hole are then bored in the instrument, and are slightly undercut.

The socket for the mouthpiece at the narrow end is sometimes reinforced with a brass collar, and sometimes ornamental silver or brass ferrules are added to reinforce each end of the instrument, especially in Austrian- or German-made cornetts. The separate cup mouthpiece is usually made of horn, ivory, or bone, with a thin rim and thread-wrapped shank, which is used to tune the instrument. Because it usually lacks a (seventh) little finger hole, its lowest note is A below middle C, though G is readily obtained by adjusting the embouchure.

Mute cornetts were usually made of boxwood. The top of the instrument is narrow; the bore is about wide at the top of the instrument, with a cone-shaped mouthpiece carved into the top across and deep.

==Cornett family==

Cornetts were built in two styles, curved and straight.

Most cornetts are shaped with gradual curve, greater than 90°, a single curve like a comma, or an S-curve. The instrument has a conical bore, and the outside shaped to have an octagonal cross-section. Curved cornets were traditionally black, the wood covered in thin black leather.
The cornett was, like many Renaissance and Baroque instruments, made in a family of sizes. Four extant sizes are the soprano (&quot;cornettino&quot;), the treble or curved cornett, the alto, the tenor or &quot;lizard&quot; and the rare bass cornett, which was supplanted by the serpent in the 17th century.

===Descant===

The &quot;cornettino&quot; is the descant, or sometimes &quot;soprano&quot; member of the cornett family. In &quot;Syntagma Musicum&quot;, it was presented as being about long and had a range from E to E in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the 18th century that changed to D to D.

===Treble===

The 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica defined this instrument using its French name (), and gave its fingered range as A to A, the lowest being one note higher than that of the alto. To play notes below A, players can slacken their embouchure.
Sibyl Marcuse did not name the normal cornett, but gave the treble&#x27;s range. David Jarratt-Knock counted surviving instruments in museums to arrive at the treble cornett being the most commonly found cornett.

===Alto===

From the 1619 the scaled drawings in &quot;Syntagma Musicum&quot;, the instrument was about long.
It was built to start playing a tone lower than the treble and has a fingered range from G to G. With good technique the lowest note is F.
The 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica called this the or alto cornet. Baines said that the use of this variant for an alto part was &quot;widely speculated.&quot;

===Tenor===

The tenor cornet (Italian: &quot;cornone&quot;, French: &quot;basse de cornetà bouquin&quot;, German: &quot;Basszink&quot;) was the tenor instrument in the cornett family. About long from the &quot;Syntagma Musicum&quot; drawing, it was &quot;proportionally wider&quot; (bottom compared to top) than the treble and alto were, and that changed the tenor&#x27;s sound quality to be more bugle-like.

Although the French and German names imply it was bass instrument, it is placed as a tenor instrument by organologists Sibyl Marcuse and Anthony Baines, who both point out that two examples of a &quot;real bass&quot; instrument exist.

The cornone was pitched about a fifth below the alto cornett, with a playing range of C to D.
Even though tenor and bass instruments were created for the family, these came later in the instrument&#x27;s development, perhaps as long as 50 years after the instrument became mainstream. The instrument was paired with other instruments to play the lower ranges, especially trombones.

===Bass===

There are very few surviving examples of instruments larger than the tenor cornett. One is called &quot;hautecontre de cornet à bouquin&quot;. The other should be called &quot;contrebass de cornet à bouquin&quot; according to Marcuse and Baines, and there are only two examples of it, one in the Paris Conservatoire museum and the other in Hamburg.
These were tuned &quot;a pitch or so below the type instrument&quot; or an octave below the cornettino. The Paris instrument is described as having &quot;an octagonal exterior and 4 extension keys.&quot; The Hamburg example has 2 extension keys.

===Straight cornett===

The common treble cornett was also made as a straight cornett (German: &quot;gerader Zink&quot;, &quot;gelber Zink&quot;, Italian: &quot;cornetto diritto&quot; or &quot;cornetto bianco&quot;) and usually light-colored, as the yellow boxwood was not covered in leather.
It has conical bore and body that does not curve. The specific instrument differs from the mute cornett by having a removable mouthpiece. Surviving instruments in museums are mainly treble with a range of A to A. A few survive as tenor instruments, range C to D.

===Mute cornett===

A mute cornett (French: &quot;cornet muet&quot;, German: &quot;stiller Zink&quot;, Italian: &quot;cornetto muto&quot;) is a straight cornett with a narrower bore and integrated mouthpiece carved into the end of the instrument&#x27;s body. The instrument tapers in thickness, until at the top it is about wide. The instruments were mainly treble cornetts, tuned to the same range as the curved treble cornett, G to A. The others found in museums are soprano cornetts, also tuned like curved instruments to E to E.

This instrument&#x27;s name tells something of its tonal nature. Its &quot;gentle, soft and sweet&quot; sound is different than the other cornetts because of its mouthpiece, and can be used in a consort of viols or recorders.
The mouthpiece is similar to that in a French horn; instead of being a cup like the other cornetts, it is a cone, about deep. Inside it transitions from cone to instrumental bore smoothly, without &quot;sharpness.&quot;
On the outside, there isn&#x27;t an obvious lip carved.

Praetorius drew a tenor mute cornett, with a seventh hole covered and labeled that a lower note could be reached by covering the base. In that range, the six holes with thumb hole could have delivered A to F. The extra plate would make it G to F, with the base covered F to F.

==History==

===Origins===
Aurignacian pipes, fashioned with four finger holes 26,000–40,000 years ago from the slender bones of bird wings or mammoth ivory, have long been considered flutes. Recovered from Vogelherdhöhle and other caves in the Swabian Jura in Germany, they are among the oldest musical instruments yet discovered. British music archaeologist Graeme Lawson found that a replica of a complete specimen played as a flute has an indistinct whispery sound, but produces the first five notes of the diatonic series in a clear, strident tone when played as an end-blown lip reed instrument. He contends that this method of playing is supported by microscopic wear patterns, the absence of a fipple or blowhole, and the well-rounded end aperture.

In modern history, the cornett has been considered by musical historians to be a development of the medieval horn, such as a cow&#x27;s horn. Francis Galpin believed the horns preceding the cornett to be goat horns.

Plain horns in the shape of animal horns have been found in medieval European art as far back as the Utrecht Psalter in the 9th century. However, horns with fingerholes also began appearing in manuscript miniatures in the 10th century. By the 12th century, these were being carved with a six sided or 8 sided exterior. In the 11th century, some of the fingerhole horns began to be made longer and thinner, beginning to take on the appearance of the cornett.

The French &quot;coradoiz&quot;, rendered now as &quot;cor à doigts&quot;, meant &quot;fingerhole horn&quot;, was seen in the 13th to 15th centuries.

The earliest cowhorn instruments were played with one hand covering four or fewer fingerholes and the other stopping the bell to create additional tones, much like on a French horn. In Northern Europe, these horns, referred to in Scandinavian languages as bukkehorns, were made from natural animal horns.

The name &quot;cornet&quot; was printed in English in the &quot;Morte d&#x27;Arthure&quot;, completed by Sir Thomas Mallory about 1470.

The cornett in its current form was developed by about 1500, as an improvement over earlier designs of fingerhole horns.

That was the path that led to the curved cornetts; another way led to the straight cornetts. In central Europe, cornetts were made from wood turned on a lathe; the fusion of these two instrument-building traditions as the cornett advanced in melodic capability explains the coexistence of the straight and curved cornetts, with the form of the latter most likely being a skeuomorphic trait derived from animal horns.

===Ends and beginnings===

The cornett was at the height of its popularity between 1550 and 1650. The instrument had declined by the 18th century. When the instrument was needed in the 19th century, it had gone extinct. Efforts to re-create it were not immediately successful and other instruments have been used in an attempt to replace it in classical music. These include the soprano saxophone, trumpet and oboe. Since the 19th century, the instrument is being made again and materials used for the body have widened to include resins. Recorded music of the instrument can be found.

Prominent cornettists today include Roland Wilson (ensemble Musica Fiata), Jean Tubéry (La Fenice), Arno Paduch (Johann Rosenmüller Ensemble), and Bruce Dickey (Concerto Palatino).

==Music for the cornett==

===Virtuoso performance===
The cornett, among other aerophones, were commonly used for virtuosic musical performances, equivalent to performances by a lead singer or violinist. A relatively large amount of solo music for the cornett (and/or violin) survives.

Giovanni Bassano was a virtuoso early player of the cornett, and Giovanni Gabrieli wrote much of his polychoral, with Bassano playing it. Heinrich Schütz also used the instrument extensively, especially in his earlier work; he had studied in Venice with Gabrieli and was likely acquainted with Bassano&#x27;s playing.

The use of the instrument had declined by 1700, although the instrument was still common in Europe until the late 18th century. Johann Sebastian Bach, Georg Philipp Telemann and their German contemporaries used both the cornett and cornettino in cantatas to play in unison with the soprano voices of the choir. Occasionally, these composers allocated a solo part to the cornetto (see Bach&#x27;s cantata &quot;O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht, BWV 118&quot;). Alessandro Scarlatti used the cornetto or pairs of cornetts in a number of his operas. Johann Joseph Fux used a pair of mute cornetts in a Requiem.

It was scored for by Gluck, in his opera &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; (he suggested the soprano trombone as an alternative) and features in the TV theme music &quot;Testament&quot; by Nigel Hess, released in 1983.

The cornett was chosen to play &quot;colla parte&quot; (in which instrumentalists play the same notes as the vocal part) in works by Bach. These include Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4 (paired with trombones) and Gottlob! nun geht das Jahr zu Ende, BWV 28 (paired with trombones).

===Popular performance===
Music books allowed non-professional musicians to learn instruments and play together. Such books included music theory, how to read sheet music, and instructions for how to reach notes on instruments. Professional musicians performed in public spaces and as part of official pomp before the country&#x27;s residents. Images of heaven reflected a musicality that showed heavenly orchestras performing before God, and instruments were brought into churches.

Public performances where the cornett might be played included the alta capella and the Collegium Musicum.

===Liturgical performance===
Like the serpent, another fingerhole horn that was paired with it, the cornett was used to reinforce the human voice, accompanying choral music. The cornett was deemed to be similar to the voice of a boy soprano, a part found in English liturgical music which the cornett accompanied. Not only English, for Mersenne speaks of the cornett being &quot;heard with the choir voices in the cathedrals or chapels.&quot;

Historically, two cornetts were frequently used in consort with three sackbuts, often to double a church choir, into the 18th century. This was particularly popular in Venetian churches such as the Basilica San Marco, where extensive instrumental accompaniment was encouraged, particularly in use with antiphonal choirs.

==Playing the cornett==
The cornett&#x27;s pitches are controlled using a combination of the player&#x27;s lips and fingerholes. The lips change pitch through different tensions. The fingerholes alter the length of the sound column.

Cornetts are made with a mouthpiece, similar to that on brass instruments, but very small. Unlike the brass mouthpieces, players don&#x27;t press the instrument to the center of their mouths, as on a trumpet. Rather the technique to produce sound is to hold the instrument to the side of the mouth, where the player&#x27;s lips are thinner. Players stretch their lips to tighten them, with help from cheek muscles.
The technique is not unique to cornets, but has also been used for the traditional animal-horn horns, such as the shofur and Slovak shepherd&#x27;s horn, as well as for folk horns such as the Russian rozhok.

Girolamo dalla Casa wrote about how the coronet should sound when played, and in doing so revealed other ways it could sound as well. He felt that the instrument was meant to imitate the human voice, saying, &quot;The cornetto is the most excellent of the wind instruments since it imitates the human voice better than the other instruments.&quot; He warned that improperly played, it would sound &quot;horn-like or muted.&quot;

To play it properly, he said that player&#x27;s must focus on the tone (with lips not spread apart and loose, or too tight and shrill). He felt tonguing was important to the sound, with energy but not too aggressive. Finally he felt that divisions or diminutions should be used, but sparingly and well. He said that cornettists should focus on making their playing sound like the human voice.

===Learning to play===
Books with cornett instruction included &quot;Grund-richtiger Unterricht der Musicalischen Kunst&quot; (&quot;Fundamentally correct instruction in the musical arts&quot;) by Daniel Speer, 1697 and &quot;Museum Musicum Theoretico-Practicum&quot; (&quot;Museum of theoretical-practical music&quot;) by Joseph Friedrich Bernhard Caspar Majer, 1732. Books written for other instruments were also applicable to the cornett. Among these were Ganassi 
dal Fontego (&quot;Opera intitulata Fontegara&quot;, 1535) and Bismantova (&quot;Compendio musicale&quot;, 1677). These books covered the recorder, but the instructions on &quot;tonguing&quot; with &quot;force and speed&quot; has application to the cornett, which was pictured on the &quot;Fontegara&quot; title page illustration.

Besides tonguing, books taught students to improvise. Students learning cornet music were encouraged to play in the &quot;diminuative&quot;, looking at sheet music and adapting it by creating runs of fast notes to replace long slow notes in written works.

The book (&quot;Il Vero Modo Di Diminuir&quot;, 1584) by cornett virtoso Girolamo Dalla Casa focused on tone, tonguing and divisions to make the cornett sound like the human voice.

==The cornett and historically informed performance==
As a result of the recent historically informed performance movement the cornett has been rediscovered, and modern works for the instrument have been written.

<doc id="50133" wikidata="Q468811" url="?curid=50133" title="Eleanor Bron">
<text>Eleanor Bron (born 14 March 1938) is an English stage, film and television actress, and an author. Her film roles include Ahme in the Beatles musical &quot;Help!&quot; (1965), the Doctor in &quot;Alfie&quot; (1966), Margaret Spencer in &quot;Bedazzled&quot; (1967) and Hermione Roddice in &quot;Women in Love&quot; (1969). She has appeared in television series such as &quot;Yes Minister&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;.

==Early life==
Bron was born on 14 March 1938 in Stanmore, Middlesex, into a Jewish family. Before her birth, her father Sydney had legally changed his name from Bronstein to Bron, in an effort to enhance his newly founded commercial enterprise, Bron&#x27;s Orchestral Service. Her elder brother was the record producer Gerry Bron.

She attended the North London Collegiate School and then Newnham College, Cambridge, where she read Modern Languages. She later characterised her time at Newnham as &quot;three years of unparalleled pampering and privilege&quot;.

==Career==

===Early work===
Bron began her career in the Cambridge Footlights revue of 1959, titled &quot;The Last Laugh&quot;, in which Peter Cook also appeared. The addition of a female performer to the Footlights was a departure; until that time it had been all-male, with female characters portrayed in drag.

===Film appearances===
Bron&#x27;s film appearances include the role of Ahme in the Beatles&#x27; film &quot;Help!&quot; (1965); her name inspired Paul McCartney when he composed &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;. It is rumored that for some time after the filming, Bron carried on an affair with John Lennon. Other roles included the doctor who grounds Michael Caine&#x27;s character in &quot;Alfie&quot; (1966), the unattainable Margaret Spencer in Peter Cook and Dudley Moore&#x27;s film &quot;Bedazzled&quot; (1967), Hermione Roddice in Ken Russell&#x27;s &quot;Women in Love&quot; (1969), and Sisters McFee and MacArthur in &quot;The National Health&quot; (1973).

She also appeared in the films &quot;Two for the Road&quot; (1967) alongside Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn, and &quot;A Touch of Love&quot; (1969) with Sandy Dennis and Ian McKellen. She later appeared in film adaptations of &quot;Black Beauty&quot; (1994), and &quot;A Little Princess&quot; (1995).

===Television work===
Bron&#x27;s earliest work for television included appearances on David Frost&#x27;s &quot;Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life&quot;, &quot;My Father Knew Lloyd George&quot; and &quot;BBC-3&quot;, where she performed in sketches with John Fortune; they had already worked together at Peter Cook&#x27;s Establishment Club. Later, her work included such programmes as &quot;Where Was Spring?&quot; (1969, also alongside Fortune), &quot;World in Ferment&quot; (1969), and &quot;After That, This&quot; (1975) – the one with the &quot;egg&quot; timer in the opening credits.

She collaborated with novelist and playwright Michael Frayn on the BBC programmes &quot;Beyond a Joke&quot; (1972) and &quot;Making Faces&quot; (1975).

From the mid-1970s, Bron made occasional appearances with the Monty Python team, such as &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; series of concerts in support of Amnesty International.

She appeared in &quot;Equal Opportunities&quot;, a 1982 episode of the BBC series &quot;Yes Minister&quot;, playing a senior civil servant in Jim Hacker&#x27;s Department. Hacker plans to promote her—ostensibly to strike a blow for women&#x27;s rights—only to be sorely disappointed.

In 1979 Bron appeared as Maggie Hartley, a stage actress accused of murder, in an episode of the popular British legal series &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot;, entitled &quot;Rumpole and the Show Folk&quot;, which starred Leo McKern in the title role. She and Leo McKern had appeared together in &quot;Help!&quot;. She appeared as Mary in &quot;The Day Christ Died&quot; (1980), and played Mrs Barrymore in the 1983 TV movie &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; which starred Ian Richardson as Sherlock Holmes. That year also saw her appearance in an episode of &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; (Series 6, The Tribute).

Bron appeared twice in the original series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. She had a brief comedic scene in the serial &quot;City of Death&quot; (1979) alongside John Cleese, which was at the suggestion of its co-writer Douglas Adams. The pair are art critics in Denise Rene&#x27;s art gallery in Paris who are admiring the TARDIS (which they think to be a piece of art), when the Doctor (Tom Baker), Romana (Lalla Ward), and Duggan (Tom Chadbon) rush into it and it dematerialises. Bron&#x27;s character, believing this to be part of the work, states that it is &quot;Exquisite, absolutely exquisite!&quot; She also had the main guest billing as the villain Kara in the Colin Baker era serial &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot; (1985). Bron later appeared in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio drama &quot;Loups-Garoux&quot; (2001) starring Peter Davison, in which she played the wealthy heiress Ileana de Santos.

Bron played an art critic again in 1990, appearing in the BBC sketch comedy show &quot;French and Saunders&quot; in a parody of an Andy Warhol documentary. Later she made frequent appearances in Jennifer Saunders&#x27; television series &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;. Bron played, via flashback, the recurring character of Patsy&#x27;s mother, a woman who &quot;scattered bastard babies across Europe like a garden sprinkler&quot;. After giving birth, she would always say &quot;Now take it away! And bring me another lover.&quot; In 1992, she played Maria Lazlos in an episode of the first series of &quot;Heartbeat&quot;. She had a supporting role in the 1994 BBC ghost story &quot;The Blue Boy&quot;, and also appeared in the BBC&#x27;s biographical TV movie &quot;Saint-Ex&quot; in 1996. She also narrated an episode on &quot;Wild Discovery&quot;.

===Stage appearances===
In 1973 Bron appeared in the West End musical &quot;The Card&quot;. Throughout the 1980s she appeared in Amnesty International&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; live benefit shows, working alongside Peter Cook and Rowan Atkinson, starting with the stage show that preceded those, &quot;A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)&quot; in 1976. In 2005 she appeared at the Liverpool Empire Theatre in the musical play &quot;Twopence to Cross the Mersey&quot;. She appeared in the role of an abbess in Howard Brenton&#x27;s play &quot;In Extremis&quot;, staged at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe in 2007. She also appeared in the dramatised version of Pedro Almodóvar&#x27;s film &quot;All About My Mother&quot;, which opened at the Old Vic theatre in the late summer of 2007.

Bron also gave the premiere performance of &quot;The Yellow Cake Revue&quot; (1980), a series of pieces for voice and piano written by Peter Maxwell Davies in protest against uranium mining in the Orkney Islands. Bron has written and performed new verses for Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27; &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot;. She has also performed and recorded the female reciter part in William Walton&#x27;s Façade (entertainment) with the Nash Ensemble.

===Since 1985===
In 1985 Bron was selected, for her authoritative tone, to become &quot;the voice of BT&quot; and can still be heard on various British telephone error messages such as &quot;The number you have dialled has not been recognised, please check and try again&quot;.

In 1998, she appeared as Frau Luther in episode 2 &quot;Stuckart&quot; of the BBC Radio 4 adaptation of &quot;Fatherland&quot;, a novel by Robert Harris. 

In 2001 and 2002, she appeared in the BBC radio comedy sketch show &quot;The Right Time&quot;, along with Graeme Garden, Paula Wilcox, Clive Swift, and Neil Innes. Another notable radio appearance was in &quot;The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; in the 2002 episode &quot;The Madness of Colonel Warburton&quot;. In 2001 she played the great-grandmother in the seven-part ITV series &quot;Gypsy Girl&quot;, based on books by Elizabeth Arnold.

In 2006, she narrated the BBC Radio 4 adaptation of the Craig Brown book &quot;1966 and All That&quot;. Her other voice work includes a recorded tour of Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum in London, England.

In April 2010, Bron, along with Ian McKellen and Brian Cox, appeared in a series of TV advertisements to support Age UK, the charity recently formed from the merger of Age Concern and Help the Aged. All three actors gave their time free of charge.

In June 2010, she guest-starred in &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot; in the episode &quot;The Russian House&quot;. She appeared in the long-running British TV series &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; as Lady Isobel DeQuetteville in the episode &quot;The Dark Rider&quot;, first aired on ITV1 on 1 February 2012. In 2019 she appeared as Maxine in &quot;The Miniature Murders.&quot;

On 25 December 2013, Bron appeared on BBC One in &quot;The Tractate Middoth&quot;, an adaptation of the M.R. James ghost story &quot;The Tractate Middoth&quot;. On 25 July 2014, she joined the cast of radio soap &quot;The Archers&quot;, playing the part of Carol Tregorran.

In November–December 2019, Bron read Salley Vickers&#x27;s &quot;Grandmothers&quot; in 10 parts on BBC Radio 4.

==Personal life==
Bron was the partner of the architect Cedric Price for many years until his death in 2003; they had no children. An interview with Bron in 2015 revealed that she had voted for Jeremy Corbyn in the Labour leadership election. Bron is a pescetarian.

<text>The Third Council of Constantinople, counted as the Sixth Ecumenical Council by the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic Churches, and by certain other Western Churches, met in 680–681 and condemned monoenergism and monothelitism as heretical and defined Jesus Christ as having two energies and two wills (divine and human).

==Background==

The council settled a set of theological controversies that went back to the sixth century but had intensified under the emperors Heraclius () and Constans II (). Heraclius had set out to recover much of the part of his empire lost to the Persians and had attempted to bridge the controversy with monophysitism, which was particularly strong in Syria and Egypt, by proposing a moderate theological position that had as good support in the tradition as any other. The result was first monoenergism, i.e., that Christ, though existing in two natures (divine and human), had one energy; the second was monothelitism, i.e., that Christ had one will (that is, that there was no opposition in Christ between his human and divine volition). This doctrine was accepted in most of the Byzantine world. Still, it was opposed in Jerusalem and Rome and started a controversy that persisted even after the loss of the reconquered provinces and the death of Heraclius. When Heraclius&#x27; grandson Constans II took the throne, he saw the controversy as threatening the stability of the Empire and attempted to silence discussion by outlawing speaking either in favor or against the doctrine. Pope Martin I and the monk Maximus, the foremost opponents of monothelitism (which they interpreted as denying a human faculty of will to Christ), held a synod in Rome in 649 that condemned monoenergism and monothelitism. At Constantinople in around 653, some accused the Pope of supporting revolution; this was regarded as high treason, and Martin was accordingly arrested, tried, condemned and sent into exile, where he soon died. Martin and Maximus&#x27;s position was supported by others at the Council of Constantinople.

==Preparations==
After Constans&#x27; son and successor, Constantine IV had overcome the Muslim siege of Constantinople in 678, he immediately set his sights on restoring communion with Rome: he wrote to Pope Donus suggesting a conference on the matter. When the letter reached Rome, Donus had died. Still, his successor, Pope Agatho, agreed to the Emperor&#x27;s suggestion and ordered councils held throughout the West so that legates could present the tradition of the Western Church. There was a synod in Milan under Archbishop Mausuetus; another synod was held in 680 at Hatfield, over which Theodore, Archbishop of Canterbury presided. Pope Agatho then convened a synod at Rome at Easter 680, with representatives from the regional synods.

Then he sent a delegation to meet the Easterners at Constantinople. The delegates set out bearing two letters, one from Pope Agatho to the Emperor and the other from the bishops of the Rome synod to those gathered in Constantinople.

In the meantime, Constantine summoned Patriarch George I of Constantinople and all bishops of his jurisdiction of Constantinople to a council. He also summoned Patriarch Macarius of Antioch, a Byzantine appointee permanently resident in Constantinople because of the Muslim occupation of his see.

==Proceedings==

On 7 November 680, a mere 37 bishops and several presbyters convened in the imperial palace, the domed hall called the Trullus. The patriarchs of Constantinople and Antioch participated in person. In contrast, the patriarchates of Alexandria and Jerusalem were represented by Byzantine appointees (because of the Saracen Muslim conquest, there was, at this date, no patriarch in either of these sees). The Pope and a council he had held in Rome were represented (as was customary at eastern ecumenical councils) by a few priests and bishops. In its opening session, the council assumed the authority of an ecumenical council. The emperor attended and presided over the first eleven sessions, participated in the discussions, and returned for the closing session on 16 September 681, attended by 151 bishops.

During the council, a letter by Pope Agatho was read, which asserted the traditional belief of the Church that Christ was of two wills, divine and human. Most of the bishops present accepted the letter, proclaiming that Peter spoke through Agatho, though this council also proclaimed another historical pope as anathema. Macarius of Antioch defended monothelitism but was condemned and deposed, along with his partisans. The council, in keeping with Agatho&#x27;s letter, defined that Jesus Christ possessed two energies and two wills but that the human will was &#x27;in subjection to his divine and all-powerful will&#x27;. The council carefully avoided any mention of Maximus the Confessor, who was still regarded with suspicion. It condemned both monoenergism and monothelitism as heretical and included those who had supported this heresy, including Pope Honorius I and four previous patriarchs of Constantinople. When the council had concluded, the decrees were sent to Rome where they were accepted by Agatho&#x27;s successor, Pope Leo II. In his letter of confirmation of the council, Leo accuses, &quot;Honorius who did not attempt to sanctify this Apostolic Church with the teaching of Apostolic tradition, but by profane treachery permitted its purity to be polluted&quot;.

At some point during the council&#x27;s proceedings, a Monothelite priest claimed he could raise the dead, thereby proving his faith supreme. He had a corpse brought forth, but after whispering prayers into its ears, he could not revive the body.

<doc id="50139" wikidata="Q164823" url="?curid=50139" title="Girolamo Savonarola">
<text>Girolamo Savonarola, OP (, ; ; 21 September 1452 – 23 May 1498), also referred to as Jerome Savonarola, was an ascetic Dominican friar from Ferrara and a preacher active in Renaissance Florence. He became known for his prophecies of civic glory, his advocacy of the destruction of secular art and culture, and his calls for Christian renewal. He denounced clerical corruption, despotic rule, and the exploitation of the poor.

In September 1494, when King Charles VIII of France invaded Italy and threatened Florence, Savonarola&#x27;s prophecies seemed on the verge of fulfillment. While the friar intervened with the French king, the Florentines expelled the ruling Medicis and at Savonarola&#x27;s urging established a &quot;well received&quot; republic, effectively under Savonarola&#x27;s control. Declaring that Florence would be the New Jerusalem, the world centre of Christianity and &quot;richer, more powerful, more glorious than ever&quot;, he instituted an extreme moralistic campaign, enlisting the active help of Florentine youth.

In 1495, when Florence refused to join Pope Alexander VI&#x27;s Holy League against the French, the Vatican summoned Savonarola to Rome. He disobeyed, and further defied the pope by preaching under a ban, highlighting his campaign for reform with processions, bonfires of the vanities, and pious theatricals. In retaliation, Pope Alexander excommunicated Savonarola in May 1497 and threatened to place Florence under an interdict. A trial by fire proposed by a rival Florentine preacher in April 1498 to test Savonarola&#x27;s divine mandate turned into a fiasco, and popular opinion turned against him. Savonarola and two of his supporting friars were imprisoned. On 23 May 1498, Church and civil authorities condemned, hanged, and burned the bodies of the three friars in the main square of Florence.

Savonarola&#x27;s devotees, the , kept his cause of republican freedom and religious reform alive well into the following century. Pope Julius II (in office: 1503–1513) allegedly considered his canonization. The Medici—restored to power in Florence in 1512 with the help of the papacy—eventually weakened the movement. Some early Protestants, including Martin Luther himself, have regarded Savonarola as a vital precursor to the Protestant Reformation.

== Early years ==

Savonarola was born on 21 September 1452 in Ferrara to Niccolò di Michele and Elena. His father, Niccolò, was born in Ferrara to a family originally from Padua; his mother, Elena, claimed a lineage from the Bonacossi family of Mantua. She and Niccolò had seven children, of whom Girolamo was third. His grandfather, Michele Savonarola, a noted and successful physician and polymath, oversaw Girolamo&#x27;s education. The family amassed a great deal of wealth from Michele&#x27;s medical practice. After his grandfather&#x27;s death in 1468 Savonarola may have attended the public school run by Battista Guarino, son of Guarino da Verona, where he would have received his introduction to the classics as well as to the poetry and writings of Petrarch, father of Renaissance humanism. Earning an arts degree at the University of Ferrara, he prepared to enter medical school, following in his grandfather&#x27;s footsteps. At some point, however, he abandoned his career intentions.

In his early poems he expresses his preoccupation with the state of the Church and of the world. He began to write poetry of an apocalyptic bent, notably &quot;On the Ruin of the World&quot; (1472) and &quot;On the Ruin of the Church&quot; (1475), in which he singled out the papal court at Rome for special obloquy. About the same time he seems to have been thinking about a life in religion. As he later told his biographer, a sermon he heard by a preacher in Faenza persuaded him to abandon the world. Most of his biographers reject or ignore the account of his younger brother and follower, Maurelio (later fra Mauro), that in his youth Girolamo had been spurned by a neighbour, Laudomia Strozzi, to whom he had proposed marriage. True or not, in a letter he wrote to his father when he left home to join the Dominican Order he hints at being troubled by desires of the flesh. There is also a story that on the eve of his departure he dreamed that he was cleansed of such thoughts by a shower of icy water, which prepared him for the ascetic life. In the unfinished treatise he left behind, later called &quot;De contemptu Mundi&quot; or &quot;On Contempt for the World&quot;, he calls upon readers to fly from this world of adultery, sodomy, murder, and envy.

Savonarola studied Augustine and Thomas Aquinas. He also studied the scriptures and memorised parts. On 25 April 1475, Savonarola went to Bologna, where he knocked on the door of the Friary of San Domenico, of the Order of Friars Preacher, and asked to be admitted. As he told his father in his farewell letter, he wanted to become a knight of Christ.

== Friar ==
In the convent, Savonarola took the vow of obedience proper to his order, and after a year was ordained to the priesthood. He studied Scripture, logic, Aristotelian philosophy and Thomistic theology in the Dominican studium, practised preaching to his fellow friars, and engaged in disputations. He then matriculated in the theological faculty to prepare for an advanced degree. Even as he continued to write devotional works and to deepen his spiritual life, he was openly critical of what he perceived as the decline in convent austerity. In 1478 his studies were interrupted when he was sent to the Dominican priory of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Ferrara as assistant master of novices. The assignment might have been a normal, temporary break from the academic routine, but in Savonarola&#x27;s case, it was a turning point. One explanation is that he had alienated certain of his superiors, particularly fra Vincenzo Bandelli, or Bandello, a professor at the studium and future master general of the Dominicans, who resented the young friar&#x27;s opposition to modifying the Order&#x27;s rules against the ownership of property.

In 1482, instead of returning to Bologna to resume his studies, Savonarola was assigned as lector, or teacher, in the Convent of San Marco in Florence. In San Marco, fra Girolamo (Savonarola) taught logic to the novices, wrote instructional manuals on ethics, logic, philosophy and government, composed devotional works, and prepared his sermons for local congregations. As he recorded in his notes, his preaching was not altogether successful. Florentines were put off by his foreign-sounding Ferrarese speech, his strident voice and (especially to those who valued humanist rhetoric) his inelegant style.

While waiting for a friend in the Convent of San Giorgio, he was studying Scripture when he suddenly conceived &quot;about seven reasons&quot; why the Church was about to be scourged and renewed. He broached these apocalyptic themes in San Gimignano, where he went as Lenten preacher in 1485 and again in 1486. A year later, when he left San Marco for a new assignment, he had said nothing of his &quot;San Giorgio revelations&quot; in Florence.

== Preacher ==
For the next several years, Savonarola lived as an itinerant preacher with a message of repentance and reform in the cities and convents of north Italy. As his letters to his mother and his writings show, his confidence and sense of mission grew along with his widening reputation. In 1490, he was reassigned to San Marco. It seems that this was due to the initiative of the humanist philosopher-prince, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, who had heard Savonarola in a formal disputation in Reggio Emilia and been impressed with his learning and piety. Pico was in trouble with the Church for some of his unorthodox philosophical ideas (the famous &quot;900 theses&quot;) and was living under the protection of Lorenzo the Magnificent, the Medici &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Florence. To have Savonarola beside him as a spiritual counsellor, he persuaded Lorenzo that the friar would bring prestige to the convent of San Marco and its Medici patrons. After some delay, apparently due to the interference of his former professor fra Vincenzo Bandelli, now Vicar General of the Order, Lorenzo succeeded in bringing Savonarola back to Florence, where he arrived in May or June of that year.

== Prophet ==

Savonarola preached on the First Epistle of John and on the Book of Revelation, drawing such large crowds that he eventually moved to the cathedral. Without mentioning names, he made pointed allusions to tyrants who usurped the freedom of the people, and he excoriated their allies, the rich and powerful who neglected and exploited the poor. Complaining of the evil lives of a corrupt clergy, he now called for repentance and renewal before the arrival of a divine scourge. Scoffers dismissed him as an over-excited zealot and &quot;preacher of the desperate&quot; and sneered at his growing band of followers as &quot;Piagnoni&quot;—&quot;Weepers&quot; or &quot;Wailers&quot;, an epithet they adopted. In 1492 Savonarola warned of &quot;the Sword of the Lord over the earth quickly and soon&quot; and envisioned terrible tribulations to Rome. Around 1493 (these sermons have not survived) he began to prophesy that a New Cyrus was coming over the mountains to begin the renewal of the Church.

In September 1494 King Charles VIII of France crossed the Alps with a formidable army, throwing Italy into political chaos. Many viewed the arrival of King Charles as proof of Savonarola&#x27;s gift of prophecy. Charles advanced on Florence, sacking Tuscan strongholds and threatening to punish the city for refusing to support his expedition. As the populace took to the streets to expel Piero the Unfortunate, Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s son and successor, Savonarola led a delegation to the camp of the French king in mid-November 1494. He pressed Charles to spare Florence and enjoined him to take up his divinely appointed role as the reformer of the Church. After a short, tense occupation of the city, and another intervention by fra Girolamo (as well as the promise of a huge subsidy), the French resumed their journey southward on 28 November 1494. Savonarola now declared that by answering his call to penitence, the Florentines had begun to build a new Ark of Noah which had saved them from the waters of the divine flood. Even more sensational was the message in his sermon of 10 December:

I announce this good news to the city, that Florence will be more glorious, richer, more powerful than she has ever been; First, glorious in the sight of God as well as of men: and you, O Florence will be the reformation of all Italy, and from here the renewal will begin and spread everywhere, because this is the navel of Italy. Your counsels will reform all by the light and grace that God will give you. Second, O Florence, you will have innumerable riches, and God will multiply all things for you. Third, you will spread your empire, and thus you will have power temporal and spiritual.

This astounding guarantee may have been an allusion to the traditional patriotic myth of Florence as the new Rome, which Savonarola would have encountered in his readings in Florentine history. In any case, it encompassed both temporal power and spiritual leadership.

== Reformer ==

With Savonarola&#x27;s advice and support (as a non-citizen and cleric he was ineligible to hold office), a Savonarolan political &quot;party&quot;, dubbed &quot;the Frateschi&quot;, took shape and steered the friar&#x27;s program through the councils. The oligarchs most compromised by their service to the Medici were barred from office. A new constitution enfranchised the artisan class, opened minor civic offices to selection by lot, and granted every citizen in good standing the right to a vote in a new parliament, the Consiglio Maggiore, or Great Council. At Savonarola&#x27;s urging, the Frateschi government, after months of debate, passed a &quot;Law of Appeal&quot; to limit the longtime practice of using exile and capital punishment as factional weapons. Savonarola declared a new era of &quot;universal peace&quot;. On 13 January 1495 he preached his great Renovation Sermon to a huge audience in the cathedral, recalling that he had begun prophesying in Florence four years earlier, although the divine light had come to him &quot;more than fifteen, maybe twenty years ago&quot;. He now claimed that he had predicted the deaths of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici and of Pope Innocent VIII in 1492 and the coming of the sword to Italy—the invasion of King Charles of France. As he had foreseen, God had chosen Florence, &quot;the navel of Italy&quot;, as his favourite and he repeated: if the city continued to do penance and began the work of renewal it would have riches, glory and power.

If the Florentines had any doubt that the promise of worldly power and glory had heavenly sanction, Savonarola emphasised this in a sermon of 1 April 1495, in which he described his mystical journey to the Virgin Mary in heaven. At the celestial throne Savonarola presents the Holy Mother a crown made by the Florentine people and presses her to reveal their future. Mary warns that the way will be hard both for the city and for him, but she assures him that God will fulfil his promises: Florence will be &quot;more glorious, more powerful and richer than ever, extending its wings farther than anyone can imagine&quot;. She and her heavenly minions will protect the city against its enemies and support its alliance with the French. In the New Jerusalem that is Florence peace and unity will reign. Based on such visions, Savonarola promoted theocracy, and declared Christ the king of Florence. He saw sacred art as a tool to promote this worldview, and he was therefore only opposed to secular art, which he saw as worthless and potentially damaging.

Buoyed by liberation and prophetic promise, the Florentines embraced Savonarola&#x27;s campaign to rid the city of &quot;vice&quot;. At his repeated insistence, new laws were passed against &quot;sodomy&quot; (which included male and female same-sex relations), adultery, public drunkenness, and other moral transgressions, while his lieutenant Fra Silvestro Maruffi organised boys and young men to patrol the streets to curb immodest dress and behaviour. For a time, Pope Alexander VI (1492–1503) tolerated friar Girolamo&#x27;s strictures against the Church, but he was moved to anger when Florence declined to join his new Holy League against the French invader, and blamed it on Savonarola&#x27;s pernicious influence. An exchange of letters between the pope and the friar ended in an impasse which Savonarola tried to break by sending the pope &quot;a little book&quot; recounting his prophetic career and describing some of his more dramatic visions. This was the Compendium of Revelations, a self-dramatisation which was one of the farthest-reaching and most popular of his writings.

The pope was not mollified. He summoned the friar to appear before him in Rome, and when Savonarola refused, pleading ill health and confessing that he was afraid of being attacked on the journey, Alexander banned him from further preaching. For some months Savonarola obeyed, but when he saw his influence slipping he defied the pope and resumed his sermons, which became more violent in tone. He not only attacked secret enemies at home whom he rightly suspected of being in league with the papal Curia, he condemned the conventional, or &quot;tepid&quot;, Christians who were slow to respond to his calls. He dramatised his moral campaign with special Masses for the youth, processions, bonfires of the vanities and religious theatre in San Marco. He and his close friend, the humanist poet Girolamo Benivieni, composed lauds and other devotional songs for the Carnival processions of 1496, 1497 and 1498, replacing the bawdy Carnival songs of the era of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici. These continued to be copied and performed after his death, along with songs composed by Piagnoni in his memory. A number of them have survived.
== Proto-Protestant ==
The writings of Savonarola spread widely to Germany and Switzerland, and due to Savonarola&#x27;s life and death, many people started to see the papacy as corrupted and sought a new reform of the church. Many people saw him as a martyr, including Martin Luther, who was influenced by Savonarola&#x27;s writings. Savonarola&#x27;s beliefs on the doctrine of justification are similar in some respects to Martin Luther’s teachings, stating that humans are not justified by themselves. Savonarola may have influenced John Calvin, but this is a matter of historical debate. 

Savonarola never abandoned the dogmas of the Roman Catholic Church; for example, Savonarola held to a belief in seven sacraments and that the Church of Rome is &quot;the mother of all other churches and the pope its head&quot;. However, his protests against papal corruption and his reliance on the Bible as the main guide link Savonarola with the later reformation. Savonarola, while revering the office of the papacy, nevertheless criticised the pope Alexander VI and his papal court. Savonarola even prophesied that Rome will come under judgement from God.the Pope may command me to do something that contravenes the law of Christian love or the Gospel. But, if he did so command, I would say to him, thou art no shepherd. Not the Roman Church, but thou errest 

Who are the fat kine of Bashan on the mountains of Samaria? I say they are the courtesans of Italy and Rome. Or, are there none? A thousand are too few for Rome, 10,000, 12,000, 14,000 are too few for Rome. Prepare thyself, O Rome, for great will be thy punishmentsCatholic sources, however, criticize the inclusion of Savonarola as a Protestant forerunner, because much of his theology still aligned with Rome. Despite inspiring some Protestant reformers, Savonarola also influenced some leaders of the Counter-Reformation.

== Excommunication and death ==

On 12 May 1497, Borgia Pope Alexander VI excommunicated Savonarola, and also threatened the Florentines with an interdict if they persisted in harbouring him. After describing the contemporary Church leadership as a pockmarked whore sitting on Solomon&#x27;s throne, Savonarola was excommunicated for heresy and sedition. On 18 March 1498, after much debate and steady pressure from a worried government, Savonarola withdrew from public preaching. Under the stress of excommunication, he composed his spiritual masterpiece, the &quot;Triumph of the Cross&quot;, a celebration of the victory of the Cross over sin and death and an exploration of what it means to be a Christian. This he summed up in the theological virtue of &quot;caritas&quot;, or love. In loving their neighbours, Christians return the love which they have received from their Creator and Savior. Savonarola hinted at performing miracles to prove his divine mission, but when a rival Franciscan preacher proposed to test that mission by walking through fire, he lost control of public discourse. Without consulting him, his confidant Fra Domenico da Pescia offered himself as his surrogate and Savonarola felt he could not afford to refuse. The first trial by fire in Florence in over four hundred years was set for 7 April.

A crowd filled the central square, eager to see if God would intervene, and if so, on which side. The nervous contestants and their delegations delayed the start of the contest for hours. A sudden rain drenched the spectators and government officials cancelled the proceedings. The crowd disbanded angrily; the burden of proof had been on Savonarola, and he was blamed for the fiasco. A mob assaulted the convent of San Marco. Fra Girolamo, Fra Domenico, and Fra Silvestro Maruffi were arrested and imprisoned. Under torture Savonarola confessed to having invented his prophecies and visions, then recanted, then confessed again. In his prison cell in the tower of the government palace he composed meditations on Psalms 51 (&quot;Infelix ego&quot;) and 31 (&quot;Tristitia obsedit me&quot;). On the morning of 23 May 1498, the three friars were led out into the main square where, before a tribunal of high clerics and government officials, they were condemned as heretics and schismatics, and sentenced to die forthwith. Stripped of their Dominican garments in ritual degradation, they mounted the scaffold in their thin white shirts. Each on separate gallows, they were hanged, while fires were ignited below them to consume their bodies. To prevent devotees from searching for relics, their ashes were carted away and scattered in the Arno.

== Aftermath ==
Resisting censorship and exile, the friars of San Marco fostered a cult of &quot;the three martyrs&quot; and venerated Savonarola as a saint. They encouraged women in local convents and surrounding towns to find mystical inspiration in his example, and, by preserving many of his sermons and writings, they helped keep his political as well as his religious ideas alive. 

The return of the Medici in 1512 ended the Savonarola-inspired republic and intensified pressure against the movement, although both were briefly revived in 1527 when the Medici were once again forced out. In 1530, Medici Pope Clement VII (Giulio de&#x27; Medici), with the help of soldiers of the Holy Roman Emperor, restored Medici rule, and Florence became a hereditary dukedom. Savonarola&#x27;s contemporary Niccolò Machiavelli discusses the friar in Chapter VI of his book &quot;The Prince&quot;, writing:
Savonarolan religious ideas found a reception elsewhere. In Germany and Switzerland the early Protestant reformers, most notably Martin Luther himself, read some of the friar&#x27;s writings and praised him as a martyr and forerunner whose ideas on faith and grace anticipated Luther&#x27;s own doctrine of justification by faith alone. In France many of his works were translated and published and Savonarola came to be regarded as a precursor of evangelical, or Huguenot reform. In Wittenberg, the hometown of Martin Luther, a statue of Girolamo Savonarola was erected to honour him.

Carafa Pope Paul IV in 1558 declared that Savonarola was not a heretic. Savonarola had remained a believer in the dogmas of the Catholic church and even in his last major work had defended the institution of the papacy. Within the Dominican Order Savonarola was seen as a devotional figure (&quot;the evolving image of a Counter-Reformation saintly prelate&quot;), and in this benevolent guise his memory lived on. Philip Neri, founder of the Oratorians, a Florentine who had been educated by the San Marco Dominicans, also defended Savonarola&#x27;s memory.

In the mid-nineteenth century, the &quot;New Piagnoni&quot; found inspiration in the friar&#x27;s writings and sermons for the Italian national awakening known as the Risorgimento. By emphasising his political activism over his puritanism and cultural conservatism they restored Savonarola&#x27;s voice for radical political change. The venerable pre-Reformation icon ceded to the fiery Renaissance reformer. This somewhat anachronistic image, fortified by much new scholarship, informed the major new biography by Pasquale Villari, who regarded Savonarola&#x27;s preaching against Medici despotism as the model for the Italian struggle for liberty and national unification. In Germany, the Catholic theologian and church historian Joseph Schnitzer edited and published contemporary sources which illuminated Savonarola&#x27;s career. In 1924 he crowned his vast research with a comprehensive study of Savonarola&#x27;s life and times in which he presented the friar as the last best hope of the Catholic Church before the catastrophe of the Protestant Reformation. In the Italian People&#x27;s Party founded by Don Luigi Sturzo in 1919, Savonarola was revered as a champion of social justice, and after 1945 he was held up as a model of reformed Catholicism by leaders of the Christian Democratic Party. From this milieu, in 1952 came the third of the major Savonarola biographies, the &quot;Vita di Girolamo Savonarola&quot; by Roberto Ridolfi. For the next half century Ridolfi was the guardian of the friar&#x27;s saintly memory as well as the dean of Savonarola research which he helped grow into a scholarly industry. Today, most of Savonarola&#x27;s treatises and sermons and many of the contemporary sources (chronicles, diaries, government documents, and literary works) are available in critical editions. 

The present-day Church has considered his beatification.

<text>In mainstream economics, economic surplus, also known as total welfare or total social welfare or Marshallian surplus (after Alfred Marshall), is either of two related quantities: 
* Consumer surplus, or consumers&#x27; surplus, is the monetary gain obtained by consumers because they are able to purchase a product for a price that is less than the highest price that they would be willing to pay.
* Producer surplus, or producers&#x27; surplus, is the amount that producers benefit by selling at a market price that is higher than the least that they would be willing to sell for; this is roughly equal to profit (since producers are not normally willing to sell at a loss and are normally indifferent to selling at a break-even price).
The sum of consumer and producer surplus is sometimes known as social surplus or total surplus; a decrease in that total from inefficiencies is called deadweight loss.

== Overview ==
In the mid-19th century, engineer Jules Dupuit first propounded the concept of economic surplus, but it was the economist Alfred Marshall who gave the concept its fame in the field of economics.

On a standard supply and demand diagram, consumer surplus is the area (triangular if the supply and demand curves are linear) above the equilibrium price of the good and below the demand curve. This reflects the fact that consumers would have been willing to buy a single unit of the good at a price higher than the equilibrium price, a second unit at a price below that but still above the equilibrium price, etc., yet they in fact pay just the equilibrium price for each unit they buy.

Likewise, in the supply-demand diagram, producer surplus is the area below the equilibrium price but above the supply curve. This reflects the fact that producers would have been willing to supply the first unit at a price lower than the equilibrium price, the second unit at a price above that but still below the equilibrium price, etc., yet they in fact receive the equilibrium price for all the units they sell.

==History==
Early writers of economic issues used surplus as a means to draw conclusions about the relationship between production and necessities. In the agricultural sector surplus was an important concept because this sector has the responsibility to feed everyone plus itself. Food is notable because people only need a specific amount of food and can only consume a limited amount. This means that excess food production must overflow to other people, and will not be rationally hoarded. The non-agricultural sector is therefore limited by the agricultural sector equaling the output of food subtracting the amount consumed by the agricultural sector. 

William Petty used a broad definition of necessities, leading him to focus on employment issues surrounding surplus. Petty explains a hypothetical example in which there is a territory of 1000 men and 100 of those men are capable of producing enough food for all 1000 men. The question becomes, what will the rest of the men do if only 100 are needed to provide necessities? He thereby suggests a variety of employments with some remaining unemployed. 

David Hume approached the agricultural surplus concept from another direction. Hume recognized that agriculture may feed more than those who cultivate it, but questioned why farmers would work to produce more than they need. Forceful production, which may occur under a feudal system, would be unlikely to generate a notable surplus in his opinion. Yet, if they could purchase luxuries and other goods beyond their necessities, they would become incentivized to produce and sell a surplus. Hume did not see this concept as abstract theory, he stated it as a fact when discussing how England developed after the introduction of foreign luxuries in his History of England.

Adam Smith&#x27;s thoughts on surplus drew on Hume. Smith noted that the desire for luxuries is infinite compared to the finite capacity of hunger. Smith saw the development in Europe as originating from landlords placing more importance on luxury spending rather than political power.

Consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay and the actual price they do pay. If a consumer is willing to pay more for a unit of a good than the current asking price, they are getting more benefit from the purchased product than they would if the price was their maximum willingness to pay. They are receiving the same benefit, the obtainment of the good, at a lesser cost. An example of a good with generally high consumer surplus is drinking water. People would pay very high prices for drinking water, as they need it to survive. The difference in the price that they would pay, if they had to, and the amount that they pay now is their consumer surplus. The utility of the first few liters of drinking water is very high (as it prevents death), so the first few liters would likely have more consumer surplus than subsequent quantities.

The maximum amount a consumer would be willing to pay for a given quantity of a good is the sum of the maximum price they would pay for the first unit, the (lower) maximum price they would be willing to pay for the second unit, etc. Typically these prices are decreasing; they are given by the individual demand curve, which must be generated by a rational consumer who maximizes utility subject to a budget constraint. Because the demand curve is downward sloping, there is diminishing marginal utility. Diminishing marginal utility means a person receives less additional utility from an additional unit. However, the price of a product is constant for every unit at the equilibrium price. The extra money someone would be willing to pay for the number units of a product less than the equilibrium quantity and at a higher price than the equilibrium price for each of these quantities is the benefit they receive from purchasing these quantities. For a given price the consumer buys the amount for which the consumer surplus is highest. The consumer&#x27;s surplus is highest at the largest number of units for which, even for the last unit, the maximum willingness to pay is not below the market price.

Consumer surplus can be used as a measurement of social welfare, shown by Robert Willig. For a single price change, consumer surplus can provide an approximation of changes in welfare. With multiple price and/or income changes, however, consumer surplus cannot be used to approximate economic welfare because it is not single-valued anymore. More modern methods are developed later to estimate the welfare effect of price changes using consumer surplus.

The aggregate consumers&#x27; surplus is the sum of the consumer&#x27;s surplus for all individual consumers. This aggregation can be represented graphically, as shown in the above graph of the market demand and supply curves. The aggregate consumers&#x27; surplus can also be said to be the maxim of satisfaction a consumer derives from particular goods and services.

===Calculation from supply and demand===
The consumer surplus (individual or aggregated) is the area under the (individual or aggregated) demand curve and above a horizontal line at the actual price (in the aggregated case, the equilibrium price). If the demand curve is a straight line, the consumer surplus is the area of a triangle:

:formula_1

where &quot;P&quot;mkt is the equilibrium price (where supply equals demand), &quot;Q&quot;mkt is the total quantity purchased at the equilibrium price, and &quot;P&quot;max is the price at which the quantity purchased would fall to 0 (that is, where the demand curve intercepts the price axis). For more general demand and supply functions, these areas are not triangles but can still be found using integral calculus. Consumer surplus is thus the definite integral of the demand function with respect to price, from the market price to the maximum reservation price (i.e., the price-intercept of the demand function):

:formula_2

where formula_3 This shows that if we see a rise in the equilibrium price and a fall in the equilibrium quantity, then consumer surplus falls.

===Calculation of a change in consumer surplus===

The change in consumer surplus is used to measure the changes in prices and income. The demand function used to represent an individual&#x27;s demand for a certain product is essential in determining the effects of a price change. An individual&#x27;s demand function is a function of the individual&#x27;s income, the demographic characteristics of the individual, and the vector of commodity prices. When the price of a product changes, the change in consumer surplus is measured as the negative value of the integral from the original actual price (&quot;P&quot;0) and the new actual price (&quot;P&quot;1) of the demand for product by the individual. If the change in consumer surplus is positive, the price change is said to have increased the individuals welfare. If the price change in consumer surplus is negative, the price change is said to have decreased the individual&#x27;s welfare.

=== Distribution of benefits when price falls ===

When supply of a good expands, the price falls (assuming the demand curve is downward sloping) and consumer surplus increases. This benefits two groups of people: consumers who were already willing to buy at the initial price benefit from a price reduction, and they may buy more and receive even more consumer surplus; and additional consumers who were unwilling to buy at the initial price will buy at the new price and also receive some consumer surplus.

Consider an example of linear supply and demand curves. For an initial supply curve &quot;S&quot;0, consumer surplus is the triangle above the line formed by price &quot;P&quot;0 to the demand line (bounded on the left by the price axis and on the top by the demand line). If supply expands from &quot;S&quot;0 to &quot;S&quot;1, the consumers&#x27; surplus expands to the triangle above P1 and below the demand line (still bounded by the price axis). The change in consumer&#x27;s surplus is difference in area between the two triangles, and that is the consumer welfare associated with expansion of supply.

Some people were willing to pay the higher price &quot;P&quot;0. When the price is reduced, their benefit is the area in the rectangle formed on the top by &quot;P&quot;0, on the bottom by &quot;P&quot;1, on the left by the price axis and on the right by line extending vertically upwards from &quot;Q&quot;0.

The second set of beneficiaries are consumers who buy more, and new consumers, those who will pay the new lower price (&quot;P&quot;1) but not the higher price (&quot;P&quot;0). Their additional consumption makes up the difference between &quot;Q&quot;1 and &quot;Q&quot;0. Their consumer surplus is the triangle bounded on the left by the line extending vertically upwards from &quot;Q&quot;0, on the right and top by the demand line, and on the bottom by the line extending horizontally to the right from &quot;P&quot;1.

=== Rule of one-half ===
The rule of one-half estimates the change in consumer surplus for small changes in supply with a constant demand curve. Note that in the special case where the consumer demand curve is linear, consumer surplus is the area of the triangle bounded by the vertical line &quot;Q&quot; = 0, the horizontal line formula_4 and the linear demand curve. Hence, the change in consumer surplus is the area of the trapezoid with i) height equal to the change in price and ii) mid-segment length equal to the average of the ex-post and ex-ante equilibrium quantities. Following the figure above,

:formula_5

where:
* CS = consumers&#x27; surplus;
* &quot;Q&quot;0 and &quot;Q&quot;1 are, respectively, the quantity demanded before and after a change in supply;
* &quot;P&quot;0 and &quot;P&quot;1 are, respectively, the prices before and after a change in supply.

== Producer surplus ==
Producer surplus is the additional benefit that the owners of production factors and product providers bring to producers due to the differences between production, the supply price of the product, and the current market price. The difference between the amount actually obtained in a market transaction and the minimum amount it is willing to accept with the production factors or the products provided.

=== Calculation of producer surplus ===
Producer surplus is usually expressed by the area below the market price line and above the supply curve. In Figure 1, the shaded areas below the price line and above the supply curve between production zero and maximum output &quot;Q&quot;1 indicate producer surplus. Among them, OP1EQ1 below the price line. This indicates that the total revenue is the minimum total payment actually accepted by the manufacturer. The area OPMEQ1 below the S curve is the minimum total revenue that the manufacturer is willing to accept. In Figure 1, the area enclosed by the market price line, the manufacturer&#x27;s supply line, and the coordinate axis is the producer surplus. Because the rectangle OP1EQ1 is the total revenue actually obtained by the manufacturer, that is, &quot;A&quot; + &quot;B&quot;, and the trapezoid OPMEQ. The minimum total profit that the manufacturer is willing to accept, that is, &quot;B&quot;, so &quot;A&quot; is the producer surplus.

Obviously, the manufacturer produces and sells a certain quantity of &quot;Q&quot;1 goods at the market price &quot;P&quot;1. The manufacturer has reduced the quantity of goods for &quot;Q&quot;1, which means that the manufacturer has increased the production factors or production costs equivalent to the amount of AVC·&quot;Q&quot;1. However, at the same time, the manufacturer actually obtains a total income equivalent to the total market price &quot;P&quot;1·&quot;Q&quot;1. Since AVC is always smaller than &quot;P&quot;1, from the production and sales of goods in &quot;Q&quot;1, manufacturers not only get sales revenue equivalent to variable costs, but also get additional revenue. This part of the excess income reflects the increase in the benefits obtained by the manufacturers through market exchange. Therefore, in economics, producer surplus is usually used to measure producer welfare and is an important part of social welfare.

Producer surplus is usually used to measure the economic welfare obtained by the manufacturer in the market supply. When the supply price is constant, the producer welfare depends on the market price. If the manufacturer can sell the product at the highest price, the welfare is the greatest. As part of social welfare, the size of the producer surplus depends on many factors. Generally speaking, when other factors remain constant, an increase in market price will increase producer surplus, and a decrease in supply price or marginal cost will also increase producer surplus. If there is a surplus of goods, that is, people can only sell part of the goods at market prices, and producer surplus will decrease.

Obviously, the sum of the producer surplus of all manufacturers in the market constitutes the producer surplus of the entire market. Graphically, it should be expressed as the area enclosed by the market supply curve, the market price line and the coordinate axis.

<text>The longitude rewards were the system of inducement prizes offered by the British government for a simple and practical method for the precise determination of a ship&#x27;s longitude at sea. The prizes, established through an act of Parliament, the Longitude Act 1714 (13 Ann. c. 14), in 1714, were administered by the Board of Longitude.

This was by no means the first reward to be offered to solve this problem. Philip II of Spain offered one in 1567, Philip III in 1598 offered 6,000 ducats and a pension, whilst the States General of the Netherlands offered 10,000 florins shortly after. In 1675 Robert Hooke wanted to apply for a £1,000 reward in England for his invention of a spring-regulated watch. However, these large sums were never won, though several people were awarded smaller amounts for significant achievements.

==Background: the longitude problem==
The measurement of longitude was a problem that came into sharp focus as people began making transoceanic voyages.
Determining latitude was relatively easy in that it could be found from the altitude of the sun at noon with the aid of a table giving the sun&#x27;s declination for the day. For longitude, early ocean navigators had to rely on dead reckoning, based on calculations of the vessel&#x27;s heading and speed for a given time (much of which was based on intuition on the part of the master and/or navigator). This was inaccurate on long voyages out of sight of land, and these voyages sometimes ended in tragedy. An accurate determination of longitude was also necessary to determine the proper &quot;magnetic declination&quot;, that is, the difference between indicated magnetic north and true north, which can differ by up to 10 degrees in the important trade latitudes of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Finding an adequate solution to determining longitude at sea was therefore of paramount importance.

The Longitude Act 1714 (13 Ann. c. 14) only addressed the determination of longitude at sea. Determining longitude reasonably accurately on land was possible, from the 17th century onwards, using the Galilean moons of Jupiter as an astronomical &#x27;clock&#x27;. The moons were easily observable on land, but numerous attempts to reliably observe them from the deck of a ship resulted in failure.

The need for better navigational accuracy for increasingly longer oceanic voyages had been an issue explored by many European nations for centuries before the passing of the Longitude Act 1714 in England. Portugal, Spain, and the Netherlands offered financial incentives for solutions to the problem of longitude as early as 1598.

Addressing the problem of longitude fell, primarily, into three categories: terrestrial, celestial, and mechanical. This included detailed atlases, lunar charts, and timekeeping mechanisms at sea. It is postulated by scholars that the economic gains and political power to be had in oceanic exploration, and not scientific and technological curiosity, is what resulted in the swift passing of the Longitude Act 1714 (13 Ann. c. 14) and the largest and most famous reward, the Longitude Prize being offered.

==Establishing the prizes==
In the early 1700s, a series of maritime disasters occurred, including the wrecking of a squadron of naval vessels on the Isles of Scilly in 1707. Around the same time, mathematician Thomas Axe decreed in his will that a £1,000 prize be awarded for promising research into finding &quot;true longitude&quot; and that annual sums be paid to scholars involved in making corrected world maps.

In 1713, when the longitude proposal of William Whiston and Humphrey Ditton was presented at the opening of the session of Parliament, a general understanding of the longitude problem prompted the formation of a parliamentary committee and the swift passing of the Longitude Act on July 8, 1714. Within this act are detailed three prizes based on levels of accuracy, which are the same accuracy requirements used for the Axe prize, set by Whiston and Ditton in their petition, and recommended by Sir Isaac Newton and Edmund Halley to the parliamentary committee.

*£10,000 (equivalent to £ in 2023) for a method that could determine longitude within 1 degree (equivalent to at the equator). 
*£15,000 (equivalent to £ in 2023) for a method that could determine longitude within 40 minutes. 
*£20,000 (equivalent to £ in 2023) for a method that could determine longitude within 30 minutes.
In addition, rewards were on offer for those who could produce a method that worked within 80 geographical miles of the coast (where ships would be in most danger), and for those with promising ideas who needed financial help to bring them to trial.

Proposed methods would be tested by sailing through the ocean, from Britain to any port in West Indies (about six weeks) without losing its longitude beyond the limits listed above. Also, the contender would be required to demonstrate the accuracy of their method by determining the longitude of a specific land-based feature whose longitude was already accurately known. The parliamentary committee also established the Board of Longitude. This panel of adjudicators would review proposed solutions and were also given authority to grant up to £2,000 in advances for promising projects that did not entirely fulfill the terms of the prize levels, but that were still found worthy of encouragement. The exact terms of the requirements for the prizes would later be contended by several recipients, including John Harrison. Ultimately, the £20,000 reward was not awarded to anyone in a lump sum, although John Harrison did receive a series of payments totaling £23,065. The Board of Longitude remained in existence for more than 100 years. When it was officially disbanded in 1828, an excess of £100,000 had been disbursed.

==Notable recipients==
The Longitude Act offered a very large incentive for solutions to the longitude problem. Some later recipients of rewards, such as Euler and Mayer, made clear publicly that the money was not the incentive, but instead the important improvements to navigation and cartography. Other recipients, such as Kendall and Harrison had to appeal to the Board of Longitude and other governmental officials for adequate compensation for their work. Still others submitted radical and impractical theories, some of which can be seen in a collection at Harvard’s Houghton Library. Schemes and ideas for improvements to instruments and astronomy, both practical and impractical, can be seen among the digitised archives of the Board of Longitude.

Though the Board of Longitude did not award £20,000 at one time, they did offer sums to various individuals in recognition of their work for improvements in instrumentation or in published atlases and star charts.

===List of awardees by amount===
* John Harrison – £23,065 awarded overall after many years of contention with the Board ending in 1773.
* Thomas Mudge – £500 advance in 1777 for developing his marine timekeeper and a £3,000 award approved by a special committee in 1793 in recognition for his accomplishments.
* Tobias Mayer – £3,000 awarded to his widow for lunar distance tables, which were published in The National Almanac in 1766 and used by James Cook in his voyages.
* Thomas Earnshaw – £3,000 awarded for years of design and improvements made to chronometers.
* Charles Mason – £1,317 awarded for various contributions and improvements on Mayer’s lunar tables.
* Larcum Kendall – £800 total for his copy of and improvements and simplifications of Harrison’s sea watch (£500 for K1 – Kendall’s copy of Harrison’s H4, £200 for modified K2, and £100 for last modification model K3).
* Jesse Ramsden – £615 awarded for his engine-divided sextant with the requirement that he share his methods and the design with other instrument makers.
* John Arnold – £300 awarded in increments to improve his timekeeping design and experiments, though the accuracy required for the prize was never met.
* Leonhard Euler – £300 awarded for contributions to the lunar distance method in aid of Mayer.
* Nathaniel Davies – £300 awarded for the design of a lunar telescope for Mayer.

A full list of prizes made by the Commissioners and Board of Longitude was drawn up by Derek Howse, in an Appendix to his article on the finances of the Board of Longitude.

====Other submissions====
Only two women are known to have submitted proposals to the Longitude Commissioners, Elizabeth Johnson and Jane Squire. Incoming submissions can be found among the correspondence of the digitised papers of the Board of Longitude.

==John Harrison&#x27;s contested reward==

The winner of the most reward money under the Longitude Act is John Harrison for sea timekeepers, including his H4 sea watch. Harrison was 21 years old when the Longitude Act was passed. He spent the next 45 years perfecting the design of his timekeepers. He first received a reward from the Commissioners of Longitude in 1737 and did not receive his final payment until he was 80.

Harrison was first awarded £250 in 1737, in order to improve on his promising H1 sea clock, leading to the construction of H2. £2,000 was rewarded over the span of 1741–1755 for continued construction and completion of H2 and H3. From 1760 to 1765, Harrison received £2,865 for various expenses related to the construction, ocean trials, and eventual award for the performance of his sea watch H4. Despite
the performance of the H4 exceeding the accuracy requirement of the highest reward possible in the original Longitude Act, Harrison was rewarded £7,500 (that is, £10,000 minus payments he had received in 1762 and 1764) once he had revealed the method of making his device, and was told that he must show that his single machine could be replicated before the final £10,000 could be paid.

Harrison made one rather than the requested two further copies of H4, and he and his family members eventually appealed to King George III after petitions for further rewards were not answered by the Board of Longitude. A reward of £8,750 was granted by Parliament in 1773 for a total payment of £23,065 spanning thirty-six years.

<doc id="50151" wikidata="Q765165" url="?curid=50151" title="Leonid Brezhnev">
<text>Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev (19 December 190610 November 1982) was a Soviet politician who served as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1964 until his death in 1982, and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (head of state) from 1960 to 1964 and again from 1977 to 1982. His 18-year term as General Secretary was second only to Joseph Stalin&#x27;s in duration.

Brezhnev was born to a working-class family in Kamenskoye (now Kamianske, Ukraine) within the Yekaterinoslav Governorate of the Russian Empire. After the results of the October Revolution were finalized with the creation of the Soviet Union, Brezhnev joined the Communist party&#x27;s youth league in 1923 before becoming an official party member in 1929. When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, he joined the Red Army as a commissar and rose rapidly through the ranks to become a major general during World War II. Following the war&#x27;s end, Brezhnev was promoted to the party&#x27;s Central Committee in 1952 and became a full member of the Politburo by 1957. In 1964, he consolidated enough power to replace Nikita Khrushchev as First Secretary of the CPSU, the most powerful position in the country.

During his tenure, Brezhnev&#x27;s governance improved the Soviet Union&#x27;s international standing while stabilizing the position of its ruling party at home. Whereas Khrushchev regularly enacted policies without consulting the Politburo, Brezhnev was careful to minimize dissent among the party elite by reaching decisions through consensus thereby restoring the semblance of collective leadership. Additionally, while pushing for détente between the two Cold War superpowers, he achieved nuclear parity with the United States and strengthened Moscow&#x27;s dominion over Central and Eastern Europe. Furthermore, the massive arms buildup and widespread military interventionism under Brezhnev&#x27;s leadership substantially expanded Soviet influence abroad, particularly in the Middle East and Africa. By the mid-1970s, numerous observers argued the Soviet Union had surpassed the United States to become the world&#x27;s strongest military power.

Conversely, Brezhnev&#x27;s disregard for political reform ushered in an era of socioeconomic decline referred to as the Era of Stagnation. In addition to pervasive corruption and falling economic growth, this period was characterized by an increasing technological gap between the Soviet Union and the United States. 

After 1975, Brezhnev&#x27;s health rapidly deteriorated and he increasingly withdrew from international affairs despite maintaining his hold on power. He died on 10 November 1982 and was succeeded as general secretary by Yuri Andropov. Upon coming to power in 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev denounced Brezhnev&#x27;s government for its inefficiency and inflexibility before launching a campaign to liberalise the Soviet Union. Notwithstanding the backlash to his regime&#x27;s policies in the mid-1980s, Brezhnev&#x27;s rule has received consistently high approval ratings in public polls conducted in post-Soviet Russia.

==Early life and early career==
=== 1906–1939: Origins ===
Brezhnev was born on 19 December 1906 in Kamenskoye (now Kamianske, Ukraine) within the Yekaterinoslav Governorate of the Russian Empire, to metalworker Ilya Yakovlevich Brezhnev (1874–1934) and his wife, Natalia Denisovna Mazalova (1886–1975). His father lived in Brezhnevo (Kursky District, Kursk Oblast, Russia) before moving to Kamenskoye. The parents of Brezhnev&#x27;s mother came from Yenakiieve. Brezhnev&#x27;s ethnicity was given as Ukrainian in some documents, including his passport, and Russian in others. A statement confirming that he regarded himself as a Russian can be found in his book &quot;Memories&quot; (1979), where he wrote: &quot;And so, according to nationality, I am Russian, I am a proletarian, a hereditary metallurgist.&quot;

Like many youths in the years after the Russian Revolution of 1917, he received a technical education, at first in land management and then in metallurgy. He graduated from the Kamenskoye Metallurgical Technicum in 1935 and became a metallurgical engineer in the iron and steel industries of eastern Ukraine.

Brezhnev joined the Communist Party youth division, the Komsomol, in 1923, and the Party itself in 1929. From 1935 to 1936 he completed the compulsory term of military service. After taking courses at a tank school, he served as a political commissar in a tank factory.

During Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge, Brezhnev was one of many apparatchiks who exploited the resulting openings in the government and the party to advance rapidly in the regime&#x27;s ranks. In 1936, he became director of the Dniprodzerzhynsk Metallurgical Technicum (a technical college) and was transferred to the regional center of Dnipropetrovsk. In May 1937, he became deputy chairman of the Kamenskoye city soviet. In May 1938, after Nikita Khrushchev had taken control of the Ukrainian communist party, he was appointed head of the propaganda department of the Dnipropetrovsk regional communist party, and later, in 1939, a regional Party Secretary, in charge of the city&#x27;s defense industries. Here, he took the first steps toward building a network of supporters which came to be known as the &quot;Dnipropetrovsk Mafia&quot; that would greatly aid his rise to power.

=== 1941–1945: World War II ===
When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, Brezhnev was, like most middle-ranking Party officials, immediately drafted. He worked to evacuate Dnipropetrovsk&#x27;s industries before the city fell to the Germans on 26 August, and then was assigned as a political commissar. In October, Brezhnev was made deputy of political administration for the Southern Front, with the rank of Brigade-Commissar (Colonel).

When the Germans occupied Ukraine in 1942, Brezhnev was sent to the Caucasus as deputy head of political administration of the Transcaucasian Front. In April 1943 he became head of the Political Department of the 18th Army. Later that year, the 18th Army became part of the 1st Ukrainian Front, as the Red Army regained the initiative and advanced westward through Ukraine. The Front&#x27;s senior political commissar was Nikita Khrushchev, who had supported Brezhnev&#x27;s career since the prewar years. Brezhnev had met Khrushchev in 1931, shortly after joining the Party, and as he continued his rise through the ranks, he became Khrushchev&#x27;s protégé. At the end of the war in Europe, Brezhnev was chief political commissar of the 4th Ukrainian Front, which entered Prague in May 1945, after the German surrender.

==Rise to power==
=== Promotion to the Central Committee ===
Brezhnev left the Soviet Army with the rank of major general in August 1946. In May 1946, he was appointed the first secretary of the Zaporizhzhia regional party committee, where his deputy was Andrei Kirilenko, one of the most important members of the Dnipropetrovsk Mafia. After working on reconstruction projects in Ukraine, he returned to Dnipropetrovsk in January 1948 as regional first party secretary. In 1950 Brezhnev became a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union&#x27;s highest legislative body. In July that year he was sent to the Moldavian SSR and appointed Party First Secretary of the Communist Party of Moldova, where he was responsible for completing the introduction of collective agriculture. Konstantin Chernenko, a loyal addition to the &quot;mafia&quot;, was working in Moldova as head of the agitprop department, and one of the officials Brezhnev brought with him from Dnipropetrovsk was the future USSR Minister of the Interior, Nikolai Shchelokov. 

In 1952, Brezhnev met with Stalin who subsequently promoted him to the Communist Party&#x27;s Central Committee as a candidate member of the Presidium (formerly the Politburo) and made him a member of the Secretariat. Following Stalin&#x27;s death in March 1953, Brezhnev was demoted to first deputy head of the political directorate of the Army and Navy.

=== Advancement under Khrushchev ===
Brezhnev&#x27;s patron Khrushchev succeeded Stalin as General Secretary, while Khrushchev&#x27;s rival Georgy Malenkov succeeded Stalin as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Brezhnev sided with Khrushchev against Malenkov, but only for several years. In February 1954, he was appointed second secretary of the Communist Party of the Kazakh SSR, and was promoted to General Secretary in May, following Khrushchev&#x27;s victory over Malenkov. On the surface his brief was simple: to make the new lands agriculturally productive. In reality, Brezhnev became involved in the development of the Soviet missile and nuclear arms programs, including the Baykonur Cosmodrome. The initially successful Virgin Lands Campaign soon became unproductive and failed to solve the growing Soviet food crisis. Brezhnev was recalled to Moscow in 1956. The harvest in the years following the Virgin Lands Campaign was disappointing, which would have hurt his political career had he remained in Kazakhstan.

In February 1956 Brezhnev returned to Moscow and was made candidate member of the Politburo assigned in control of the defence industry, the space program including the Baykonur Cosmodrome, heavy industry, and capital construction. He was now a senior member of Khrushchev&#x27;s entourage, and in June 1957 he backed Khrushchev in his struggle with Malenkov&#x27;s Stalinist old guard in the Party leadership, the so-called &quot;Anti-Party Group&quot;. Following the Stalinists&#x27; defeat, Brezhnev became a full member of the Politburo. In May 1960, he was promoted to the post of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, making him the nominal head of state, although the real power resided with Khrushchev as First Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party and Premier.

=== Replacement of Khrushchev as Soviet leader ===
Khrushchev&#x27;s position as Party leader was secure until about 1962, but as he aged, he grew more erratic and his performance undermined the confidence of his fellow leaders. The Soviet Union&#x27;s mounting economic problems also increased the pressure on Khrushchev&#x27;s leadership. Brezhnev remained outwardly loyal to Khrushchev, but became involved in a 1963 plot to remove him from power, possibly playing a leading role. Also in 1963, Brezhnev succeeded Frol Kozlov, another Khrushchev protégé, as Secretary of the Central Committee, positioning him as Khrushchev&#x27;s likely successor. Khrushchev made him Second Secretary, or deputy party leader, in 1964.

After returning from Scandinavia and Czechoslovakia in October 1964, Khrushchev, unaware of the plot, went on holiday in Pitsunda resort on the Black Sea. Upon his return, his Presidium officers congratulated him for his work in office. Anastas Mikoyan visited Khrushchev, hinting that he should not be too complacent about his present situation. Vladimir Semichastny, head of the KGB, was a crucial part of the conspiracy, as it was his duty to inform Khrushchev if anyone was plotting against his leadership. Nikolay Ignatov, whom Khrushchev had sacked, discreetly requested the opinion of several Central Committee members. After some false starts, fellow conspirator Mikhail Suslov phoned Khrushchev on 12 October and requested that he return to Moscow to discuss the state of Soviet agriculture. Finally, Khrushchev understood what was happening, and said to Mikoyan, &quot;If it&#x27;s me who is the question, I will not make a fight of it.&quot; While a minority headed by Mikoyan wanted to remove Khrushchev from the office of First Secretary but retain him as the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, the majority, headed by Brezhnev, wanted to remove him from active politics altogether.

Brezhnev and Nikolai Podgorny appealed to the Central Committee, blaming Khrushchev for economic failures, and accusing him of voluntarism and immodest behavior. Influenced by Brezhnev&#x27;s allies, Politburo members voted on 14 October to remove Khrushchev from office. Some members of the Central Committee wanted him to undergo punishment of some kind, but Brezhnev, who had already been assured the office of the General Secretary, saw little reason to punish Khrushchev further. Brezhnev was appointed First Secretary on the same day, but at the time was believed to be a transitional leader, who would only &quot;keep the shop&quot; until another leader was appointed. Alexei Kosygin was appointed head of government, and Mikoyan was retained as head of state. Brezhnev and his companions supported the general party line taken after Stalin&#x27;s death but felt that Khrushchev&#x27;s reforms had removed much of the Soviet Union&#x27;s stability. One reason for Khrushchev&#x27;s ouster was that he continually overruled other party members, and was, according to the plotters, &quot;in contempt of the party&#x27;s collective ideals&quot;. The Soviet newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot; wrote of new enduring themes such as collective leadership, scientific planning, consultation with experts, organisational regularity and the ending of schemes. When Khrushchev left the public spotlight, there was no popular commotion, as most Soviet citizens, including the intelligentsia, anticipated a period of stabilization, steady development of Soviet society and continuing economic growth in the years ahead.

Political scientist George W. Breslauer has compared Khrushchev and Brezhnev as leaders. He argues they took different routes to build legitimate authority, depending on their personalities and the state of public opinion. Khrushchev worked to decentralize the government system and empower local leadership, which had been wholly subservient; Brezhnev sought to centralize authority, going so far as to weaken the roles of the other members of the Central Committee and the Politburo.

== 1964–1982: Leader of the Soviet Union ==
===Consolidation of power===
Upon replacing Khrushchev as the party&#x27;s First Secretary, Brezhnev became the de jure supreme authority of the Soviet Union. However, he was initially forced to govern as part of an unofficial Triumvirate (also known by its Russian name &quot;Troika&quot;) alongside the country&#x27;s Premier, Alexei Kosygin, and Nikolai Podgorny, a Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee and later Chairman of the Presidium. Due to Khrushchev&#x27;s disregard for the rest of the Politburo upon combining his leadership of the party with that of the Soviet government, a plenum of the Central Committee in October 1964 forbade any single individual from holding both the offices of General Secretary and Premier. This arrangement would persist until the late 1970s when Brezhnev firmly secured his position as the most powerful figure in the Soviet Union.

During his consolidation of power, Brezhnev first had to contend with the ambitions of Alexander Shelepin, the former chairman of the KGB and current head of the Party-State Control Committee. In early 1965, Shelepin began calling for the restoration of &quot;obedience and order&quot; within the Soviet Union as part of his own bid to seize power. Towards this end, he exploited his control over both state and party organs to leverage support within the regime. Recognizing Shelepin as an imminent threat to his position, Brezhnev mobilized the Soviet collective leadership to remove him from the Party-State Control Committee before having the body dissolved altogether on 6 December 1965.

By the end of 1965, Brezhnev had Podgorny removed from the Secretariat, thereby significantly curtailing the latter&#x27;s ability to build support within the party apparatus. In the ensuing years, Podgorny&#x27;s network of supporters was steadily eroded as the protégés he cultivated in his rise to power were removed from the Central Committee. By 1977, Brezhnev was secure enough in his position to replace Podgorny as head of state and remove him from the Politburo.

After sidelining Shelepin and Podgorny as threats to his leadership in 1965, Brezhnev directed his attentions to his remaining political rival, Alexei Kosygin. In the 1960s, U.S. National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger initially perceived Kosygin to be the dominant leader of Soviet foreign policy in the Politburo. Within the same timeframe, Kosygin was also in charge of economic administration in his role as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. However, his position was weakened following his enactment of several economic reforms in 1965 that collectively came to be known within the Party as the &quot;Kosygin reforms&quot;. Due largely to coinciding with the Prague Spring (whose sharp departure from the Soviet model led to its armed suppression in 1968), the reforms provoked a backlash among the party&#x27;s old guard who proceeded to flock to Brezhnev and strengthened his position within the Soviet leadership. In 1969, Brezhnev further expanded his authority following a clash with Second Secretary Mikhail Suslov and other party officials who thereafter never challenged his supremacy within the Politburo.

Brezhnev was adept at politics within the Soviet power structure. He was a team player and never acted rashly or hastily. Unlike Khrushchev, he did not make decisions without substantial consultation from his colleagues, and was always willing to hear their opinions. During the early 1970s, Brezhnev consolidated his domestic position. In 1977, he forced the retirement of Podgorny and became once again Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, making this position equivalent to that of an executive president. While Kosygin remained Premier until shortly before his death in 1980 (replaced by Nikolai Tikhonov as Premier), Brezhnev was the dominant figure in the Soviet Union from the mid-1970s until his death in 1982.

===Domestic policies===

====Ideological Development====
Brezhnev has defined the iconic &quot;Developed Socialism&quot; as the Soviet-style socialism, which he believed had successfully constructed socialism in the Soviet Union and reached Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s transition stage from socialism to communism. Brezhnev emphasized the advanced technological developments in the USSR with full electrification of the country, the use of nuclear power in production, computer planning, as well as a highly mechanized agriculture. He believed that all social strata within the USSR were closer to each other than ever before due to the highly developed productive force in the country. Therefore, the dictatorship of the proletariat has, according to Brezhnev, moved towards a people&#x27;s government. Brezhnev believed that all socialist countries would go through the same socialist development and social transformation of the Soviet model regardless of their national and material conditions.

====Repression====
Brezhnev&#x27;s stabilization policy included ending the liberalizing reforms of Khrushchev, and clamping down on cultural freedom. During the Khrushchev years, Brezhnev had supported the leader&#x27;s denunciations of Stalin&#x27;s arbitrary rule, the rehabilitation of many of the victims of Stalin&#x27;s purges, and the cautious liberalization of Soviet intellectual and cultural policy. However, as soon as he became leader of the Soviet Union, he began to reverse this process, and developed an increasingly authoritarian and conservative attitude.

By the mid-1970s, there were an estimated 5,000 political and religious prisoners across the Soviet Union, living in grievous conditions and suffering from malnutrition. Many of these prisoners were considered by the Soviet state to be mentally unfit and were hospitalized in mental asylums across the Soviet Union. Under Brezhnev&#x27;s rule, the KGB infiltrated most, if not all, anti-government organisations, which ensured that there was little to no opposition against him or his power base. However, Brezhnev refrained from the all-out violence seen under Stalin&#x27;s rule. The trial of the writers Yuli Daniel and Andrei Sinyavsky in 1966, the first such public trials since Stalin&#x27;s reign, marked the reversion to a repressive cultural policy. Under Yuri Andropov the state security service (in the form of the KGB) regained some of the powers it had enjoyed under Stalin, although there was no return to the purges of the 1930s and 1940s, and Stalin&#x27;s legacy remained largely discredited among the Soviet intelligentsia.

====Economics====

=====Economic growth until 1973=====
Between 1960 and 1970, Soviet agriculture output increased by 3% annually. Industry also improved: during the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1966–1970), the output of factories and mines increased by 138% compared to 1960. While the Politburo became aggressively anti-reformist, Kosygin was able to convince both Brezhnev and the politburo to leave the reformist communist leader János Kádár of the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic alone because of an economic reform entitled New Economic Mechanism (NEM), which granted limited permission for the establishment of retail markets. In the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, another approach was taken in 1970 under the leadership of Edward Gierek; he believed that the government needed Western loans to facilitate the rapid growth of heavy industry. The Soviet leadership gave its approval for this, as the Soviet Union could not afford to maintain its massive subsidy for the Eastern Bloc in the form of cheap oil and gas exports. The Soviet Union did not accept all kinds of reforms, an example being the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 in response to Alexander Dubček&#x27;s reforms. Under Brezhnev, the Politburo abandoned Khrushchev&#x27;s decentralization experiments. By 1966, two years after taking power, Brezhnev abolished the Regional Economic Councils, which were organized to manage the regional economies of the Soviet Union.

The Ninth Five-Year Plan delivered a change: for the first time industrial consumer products out-produced industrial capital goods. Consumer goods such as watches, furniture and radios were produced in abundance. The plan still left the bulk of the state&#x27;s investment in industrial capital-goods production. This outcome was not seen as a positive sign for the future of the Soviet state by the majority of top party functionaries within the government; by 1975 consumer goods were expanding 9% slower than industrial capital-goods. The policy continued despite Brezhnev&#x27;s commitment to make a rapid shift of investment to satisfy Soviet consumers and lead to an even higher standard of living. This did not happen.

During 1928–1973, the Soviet Union was growing economically at a faster pace than the United States and Western Europe. However, objective comparisons are difficult. The USSR was hampered by the effects of World War II, which had left most of the western USSR in ruins; however, Western aid and Soviet espionage in the period 1941–1945 (culminating in cash, material and equipment deliveries for military and industrial purposes) had allowed the Russians to leapfrog many Western economies in the development of advanced technologies, particularly in the fields of nuclear technology, radio communications, agriculture and heavy manufacturing. By the early 1970s, the Soviet Union had the world&#x27;s second largest industrial capacity, and produced more steel, oil, pig-iron, cement and tractors than any other country. Before 1973, the Soviet economy was expanding at a faster rate than that of the American economy (albeit by a very small margin). The USSR also kept a steady pace with the economies of Western Europe. Between 1964 and 1973, the Soviet economy stood at roughly half the output per head of Western Europe and a little more than one third that of the U.S. In 1973, the process of catching up with the rest of the West came to an end as the Soviet Union fell further and further behind in computer technology, which proved decisive for the Western economies. By 1973 the Era of Stagnation was apparent.

===Economic stagnation until 1982===
The Era of Stagnation, a term coined by Mikhail Gorbachev, was attributed to a compilation of factors, including the ongoing &quot;arms race&quot;; the Soviet Union&#x27;s decision to participate in international trade (thus abandoning the idea of economic isolation) while ignoring changes occurring in Western societies; increased authoritarianism in Soviet society; the invasion of Afghanistan; the bureaucracy&#x27;s transformation into an undynamic gerontocracy; lack of economic reform; pervasive political corruption, and other structural problems within the country. Domestically, social stagnation was stimulated by the growing demands of unskilled workers, labor shortages and a decline in productivity and labor discipline. While Brezhnev, albeit &quot;sporadically&quot;, through Alexei Kosygin, attempted to reform the economy in the late 1960s and 1970s, he failed to produce any positive results. One of these reforms was the economic reform of 1965, initiated by Kosygin, though its origins are often traced back to the Khrushchev Era. The reform was ultimately cancelled by the Central Committee, though the Committee admitted that economic problems did exist. After becoming leader of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev would characterize the economy under Brezhnev&#x27;s rule as &quot;the lowest stage of socialism&quot;.

Based on its surveillance, the CIA reported that the Soviet economy peaked in the 1970s upon reaching 57% of American GNP. However, beginning around 1975, economic growth began to decline at least in part due to the regime&#x27;s sustained prioritization of heavy industry and military spending over consumer goods. Additionally, Soviet agriculture was unable to feed the urban population, let alone provide for a rising standard of living which the government promised as the fruits of &quot;mature socialism&quot; and on which industrial productivity depended. Ultimately, the GNP growth rate slowed to 1% to 2% per year. As GNP growth rates decreased in the 1970s from the level held in the 1950s and 1960s, they likewise began to lag behind that of Western Europe and the United States. Eventually, the stagnation reached a point that the United States began growing an average of 1% per year above the growth rate of the Soviet Union.

The stagnation of the Soviet economy was fueled even further by the Soviet Union&#x27;s ever-widening technological gap with the West. Due to the cumbersome procedures of the centralized planning system, Soviet industries were incapable of the innovation needed to meet public demand. This was especially notable in the field of computers. In response to the lack of uniform standards for peripherals and digital capacity in the Soviet computer industry, Brezhnev&#x27;s regime ordered an end to all independent computer development and required all future models to be based on the IBM/360. However, following the adoption of the IBM/360 system, the Soviet Union was never able to build enough platforms, let alone improve on its design. As its technology continued to fall behind the West, the Soviet Union increasingly resorted to pirating Western designs.

The last significant reform undertaken by the Kosygin government, and some believe in the pre-&quot;perestroika&quot; era, was a joint decision of the Central Committee and the Council of Ministers named &quot;Improving planning and reinforcing the effects of the economic mechanism on raising the effectiveness in production and improving the quality of work&quot;, more commonly known as the 1979 reform. The reform, in contrast to the 1965 reform, sought to increase the central government&#x27;s economic involvement by enhancing the duties and responsibilities of the ministries. With Kosygin&#x27;s death in 1980, and due to his successor Nikolai Tikhonov&#x27;s conservative approach to economics, very little of the reform was actually carried out.

The Eleventh Five-Year Plan of the Soviet Union delivered a disappointing result: a change in growth from 5 to 4%. During the earlier Tenth Five-Year Plan, there had been target of 6.1% growth, but this was not met. Brezhnev was able to defer economic collapse by trading with Western Europe and the Arab World. The Soviet Union still outproduced the United States in the heavy industry sector during the Brezhnev era. Another dramatic result of Brezhnev&#x27;s rule was that certain Eastern Bloc countries became more economically advanced than the Soviet Union.

====Agricultural policy====

Brezhnev&#x27;s agricultural policy reinforced traditional ways of organizing collective farms and enforced output quotas centrally. Although there was a record-high state investment in farming during the 1970s, the evaluation of agricultural output continued to focus on the grain harvest. Despite some improvement, there were still problems such as insufficient domestic production of fodder crops and a declining sugar beet harvest. Brezhnev attempted to address these issues by increasing state investment and allowing privately owned plots to be larger. However, these actions were not effective in solving fundamental problems like a shortage of skilled workers, a ruined rural culture, and inappropriate farm machinery for small collective farms. A significant reform was necessary, but it was not supported due to ideological and political considerations.

Brezhnev&#x27;s agricultural policy reinforced the conventional methods for organizing the collective farms. Output quotas continued to be imposed centrally. Khrushchev&#x27;s policy of amalgamating farms was continued by Brezhnev, because he shared Khrushchev&#x27;s belief that bigger kolkhozes would increase productivity. Brezhnev pushed for an increase in state investments in farming, which amounted to an all-time high in the 1970s of 27% of all state investment – this figure did not include investments in farm equipment. In 1981 alone, 33 billion U.S. dollars (by contemporary exchange rate) was invested into agriculture.

Agricultural output in 1980 was 21% higher than the average production rate between 1966 and 1970. Cereal crop output increased by 18%. These improved results were not encouraging. In the Soviet Union the criterion for assessing agricultural output was the grain harvest. The import of cereal, which began under Khrushchev, had in fact become a normal phenomenon by Soviet standards. When Brezhnev had difficulties sealing commercial trade agreements with the United States, he went elsewhere, such as to Argentina. Trade was necessary because the Soviet Union&#x27;s domestic production of fodder crops was severely deficient. Another sector that was hitting the wall was the sugar beet harvest, which had declined by 2% in the 1970s. Brezhnev&#x27;s way of resolving these issues was to increase state investment. Politburo member Gennady Voronov advocated for the division of each farm&#x27;s workforce into what he called &quot;links&quot;. These &quot;links&quot; would be entrusted with specific functions, such as to run a farm&#x27;s dairy unit. His argument was that the larger the work force, the less responsible they felt. This program had been proposed to Joseph Stalin by Andrey Andreyev in the 1940s and had been opposed by Khrushchev before and after Stalin&#x27;s death. Voronov was also unsuccessful; Brezhnev turned him down, and in 1973 he was removed from the Politburo.

Experimentation with &quot;links&quot; was not disallowed on a local basis, with Mikhail Gorbachev, the then First Secretary of the Stavropol Regional Committee, experimenting with links in his region. In the meantime, the Soviet government&#x27;s involvement in agriculture was, according to Robert Service, otherwise &quot;unimaginative&quot; and &quot;incompetent&quot;. Facing mounting problems with agriculture, the Politburo issued a resolution titled, &quot;On the Further Development of Specialisation and Concentration of Agricultural Production on the Basis of Inter-Farm Co-operation and Agro-Industrial Integration&quot;. The resolution ordered kolkhozes close to each other to collaborate in their efforts to increase production. In the meantime, the state&#x27;s subsidies to the food-and-agriculture sector did not prevent bankrupt farms from operating and rises in the price of produce were offset by rises in the cost of oil and other resources. By 1977, oil cost 84% more than it did in the late 1960s. The cost of other resources had also climbed by the late 1970s.

Brezhnev&#x27;s answer to these problems was to issue two decrees, one in 1977 and one in 1981, which called for an increase in the maximum size of privately owned plots within the Soviet Union to half a hectare. These measures removed important obstacles for the expansion of agricultural output but did not solve the problem. Under Brezhnev, private plots yielded 30% of the national agricultural production when they cultivated only 4% of the land. This was seen by some as proof that de-collectivization was necessary to prevent Soviet agriculture from collapsing, but leading Soviet politicians shrank from supporting such drastic measures due to ideological and political interests. The underlying problems were the growing shortage of skilled workers, a wrecked rural culture, the payment of workers in proportion to the quantity rather than the quality of their work, and too large farm machinery for the small collective farms and the roadless countryside. In the face of this, Brezhnev&#x27;s only options were schemes such as large land reclamation and irrigation projects, or of course, radical reform.

====Society====
Over the eighteen years that Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union, average income per head increased by half; three-quarters of this growth came in the 1960s and early 1970s. During the second half of Brezhnev&#x27;s premiership, the average income per head grew by one-quarter. In the first half of the Brezhnev period, income per head increased by 3.5% per annum; slightly less growth than what it had been the previous years. This can be explained by Brezhnev&#x27;s reversal of most of Khrushchev&#x27;s policies. Consumption per head rose by an estimated 70% under Brezhnev, but with three-quarters of this growth happening before 1973 and only one-quarter in the second half of his rule. Most of the increase in consumer production in the early Brezhnev era can be attributed to the Kosygin reform.

When the USSR&#x27;s economic growth stalled in the 1970s, the standard of living and housing quality improved significantly. Instead of paying more attention to the economy, the Soviet leadership under Brezhnev tried to improve the living standard in the Soviet Union by extending social benefits. This led to an increase, though a minor one, in public support. The standard of living in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) had fallen behind that of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (GSSR) and the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic (ESSR) under Brezhnev; this led many Russians to believe that the policies of the Soviet Government were hurting the Russian population. The state usually moved workers from one job to another, which ultimately became an ineradicable feature in the Soviet industry. Government industries such as factories, mines and offices were staffed by undisciplined personnel who put a great effort into not doing their jobs; this ultimately led, according to Robert Service, to a &quot;work-shy workforce&quot;. The Soviet Government had no effective counter-measure; it was extremely difficult, if not impossible to replace ineffective workers because of the country&#x27;s lack of unemployment.

While some areas improved during the Brezhnev era, the majority of civilian services deteriorated and living conditions for Soviet citizens fell rapidly. Diseases were on the rise because of the decaying healthcare system. The living space remained rather small by First World standards, with the average Soviet person living on 13.4 square metres. Thousands of Moscow inhabitants became homeless, most of them living in shacks, doorways and parked trams. Nutrition ceased to improve in the late 1970s, while rationing of staple food products returned to Sverdlovsk for instance.

The state provided recreation facilities and annual holidays for hard-working citizens. Soviet trade unions rewarded hard-working members and their families with beach vacations in Crimea and Georgia.

Social rigidification became a common feature of Soviet society. During the Stalin era in the 1930s and 1940s, a common labourer could expect promotion to a white-collar job if he studied and obeyed Soviet authorities. In Brezhnev&#x27;s Soviet Union this was not the case. Holders of attractive positions clung to them as long as possible; mere incompetence was not seen as a good reason to dismiss anyone. In this way, too, the Soviet society Brezhnev passed on had become static.

===Foreign and defense policies===

====Invasion of Czechoslovakia====

The first crisis for Brezhnev&#x27;s regime came in 1968, with the attempt by the Communist leadership in Czechoslovakia, under Alexander Dubček, to liberalize the Communist system (Prague Spring). In July, Brezhnev publicly denounced the Czechoslovak leadership as &quot;revisionist&quot; and &quot;anti-Soviet&quot;. Despite his hardline public statements, Brezhnev was not the one pushing hardest for the use of military force in Czechoslovakia when the issue was before the Politburo. Archival evidence suggests that Brezhnev initially sought a temporary compromise with the reform-friendly Czechoslovak government when their dispute came to a head. However, in the end, Brezhnev concluded that he would risk growing turmoil domestically and within the Eastern bloc if he abstained or voted against Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia.

As pressure mounted on him within the Soviet leadership to &quot;re-install a revolutionary government&quot; within Prague, Brezhnev ordered the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, and Dubček&#x27;s removal in August. Following the Soviet intervention, he met with Czechoslovak reformer Bohumil Šimon, then a member of the Politburo of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, and said, &quot;If I had not voted for Soviet armed assistance to Czechoslovakia you would not be sitting here today, but quite possibly I wouldn&#x27;t either.&quot; However, contrary to the stabilizing effect envisioned by Moscow, the invasion served as a catalyst for further dissent in the Eastern Bloc.

====The Vietnam War====

Under the rule of Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet Union initially supported North Vietnam out of &quot;fraternal solidarity&quot;. However, as the war escalated, Khrushchev urged the North Vietnamese leadership to give up the quest of liberating South Vietnam. He continued by rejecting an offer of assistance made by the North Vietnamese government, and instead told them to enter negotiations in the United Nations Security Council. After Khrushchev&#x27;s ousting, Brezhnev resumed aiding the communist resistance in Vietnam. In February 1965, Premier Kosygin visited Hanoi with a dozen Soviet air force generals and economic experts. Over the course of the war, Brezhnev&#x27;s regime would ultimately ship $450 million worth of arms annually to North Vietnam.

Lyndon B. Johnson privately suggested to Brezhnev that he would guarantee an end to South Vietnamese hostility if Brezhnev would guarantee a North Vietnamese one. Brezhnev was interested in this offer initially but rejected the offer upon being told by Andrei Gromyko that the North Vietnamese were not interested in a diplomatic solution to the war. The Johnson administration responded to this rejection by expanding the American presence in Vietnam, but later invited the USSR to negotiate a treaty concerning arms control. The USSR did not respond, initially because of the power struggle between Brezhnev and Kosygin over which figure had the right to represent Soviet interests abroad, and later because of the escalation of the &quot;dirty war&quot; in Vietnam.

In early 1967, Johnson offered to make a deal with Ho Chi Minh, and said he was prepared to end U.S. bombing raids in North Vietnam if Ho ended his infiltration of South Vietnam. The U.S. bombing raids halted for a few days and Kosygin publicly announced his support for this offer. The North Vietnamese government failed to respond, and because of this, the U.S. continued its raids in North Vietnam. After this event, Brezhnev concluded that seeking diplomatic solutions to the ongoing war in Vietnam was hopeless. Later in 1968, Johnson invited Kosygin to the United States to discuss ongoing problems in Vietnam and the arms race. The summit was marked by a friendly atmosphere, but there were no concrete breakthroughs by either side.

In the aftermath of the Sino–Soviet border conflict, the Chinese continued to aid the North Vietnamese regime. However, with the death of Ho Chi Minh in 1969, China&#x27;s strongest link to North Vietnam was gone. In the meantime, Richard Nixon had been elected President of the United States. While having been known for his anti-communist rhetoric, Nixon said in 1971 that the U.S. &quot;&quot;must&quot; have relations with Communist China&quot;. His plan was for a slow withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Vietnam, while still retaining the government of South Vietnam. The only way he thought this was possible was by improving relations with both Communist China and the USSR. He later made a visit to Moscow to negotiate a treaty on arms control and the Vietnam War, but on Vietnam nothing could be agreed. Ultimately, years of Soviet military aid to North Vietnam finally bore fruit when collapsing morale among U.S. forces ultimately compelled their complete withdrawal from South Vietnam by 1973, thereby making way for the country&#x27;s unification under communist rule two years later.

====Sino–Soviet relations====

Soviet foreign relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China quickly deteriorated after Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s attempts to reach a &quot;rapprochement&quot; with more liberal Eastern European states such as Yugoslavia and with the west. When Brezhnev consolidated his power base in the 1960s, China was descending into crisis because of Mao Zedong&#x27;s Cultural Revolution, which led to the decimation of the Chinese Communist Party and other ruling offices. Brezhnev, a pragmatic politician who promoted the idea of &quot;stabilization&quot;, could not comprehend why Mao would start such a &quot;self-destructive&quot; drive to finish the socialist revolution, according to himself. However, Brezhnev had problems of his own in the form of Czechoslovakia whose sharp deviation from the Soviet model prompted him and the rest of the Warsaw Pact to invade their Eastern Bloc ally. In the aftermath of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, involving the overthrow of the reformist government there, the Soviet leadership proclaimed the Brezhnev Doctrine: any threat to &quot;socialist rule&quot; in any state of the Soviet Bloc in Central and Eastern Europe was a threat to all of them, and would justify the intervention of fellow socialist states to forcibly remove the threat. The references to &quot;socialism&quot; meant control by the communist parties that were loyal to the Kremlin. This new policy increased tension not only with the Eastern Bloc, but also the Asian communist states. By 1969, relations with other communist countries had deteriorated to a level where Brezhnev was not even able to gather five of the fourteen ruling communist parties to attend an international conference in Moscow. In the aftermath of the failed conference, the Soviets concluded, &quot;there was no leading center of the international communist movement.&quot; Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev repudiated the Brezhnev Doctrine in the late 1980s, as the Kremlin accepted the peaceful overthrow of Soviet rule in all its satellite countries in Eastern Europe.

Later in 1969, the deterioration in bilateral relations culminated in the Sino–Soviet border conflict. The Sino–Soviet split had chagrined Premier Alexei Kosygin a great deal, and for a while he refused to accept its irrevocability; he briefly visited Beijing in 1969 due to the increase of tension between the USSR and China. By the early 1980s, both the Chinese and the Soviets were issuing statements calling for a normalization of relations between the two states. The conditions given to the Soviets by the Chinese were the reduction of Soviet military presence in the Sino–Soviet border, the withdrawal of Soviet troops in Afghanistan and the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic; furthermore, China also wanted the Soviets to end their support for the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. Brezhnev responded in his March 1982 speech in Tashkent where he called for the normalization of relations. Full Sino–Soviet normalization of relations would prove to take years, until the last Soviet ruler, Mikhail Gorbachev, came to power.

====Soviet–U.S. relations====

During his eighteen years as Leader of the USSR, Brezhnev&#x27;s signature foreign policy innovation was the promotion of détente. While sharing some similarities with approaches pursued during the Khrushchev Thaw, Brezhnev&#x27;s policy significantly differed from Khrushchev&#x27;s precedent in two ways. The first was that it was more comprehensive and wide-ranging in its aims, and included signing agreements on arms control, crisis prevention, East–West trade, European security and human rights. The second part of the policy was based on the importance of equalizing the military strength of the United States and the Soviet Union. Defense spending under Brezhnev between 1965 and 1970 increased by 40%, and annual increases continued thereafter. In the year of Brezhnev&#x27;s death in 1982, 12% of GNP was spent on the military. Under Brezhnev the Soviet Union&#x27;s military budget increased eightfold, resulting in the possession of the largest number of ICBMs, nuclear warheads, aircraft, tanks, conventional forces and more military assets. This build up led numerous observers – including Western ones – to argue that by the mid-1970s the USSR had surpassed the United States as the world&#x27;s strongest military power.

At the 1972 Moscow Summit, Brezhnev and U.S. president Richard Nixon signed the SALT I Treaty. The first part of the agreement set limits on each side&#x27;s development of nuclear missiles. The second part of the agreement, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, banned both countries from designing systems to intercept incoming missiles so neither the U.S. or the Soviet Union would be emboldened to strike the other without fear of nuclear retaliation.

By the mid-1970s, Henry Kissinger&#x27;s policy of détente towards the Soviet Union was faltering. The détente had rested on the assumption that a &quot;linkage&quot; of some type could be found between the two countries, with the U.S. hoping that the signing of SALT I and an increase in Soviet–U.S. trade would stop the aggressive growth of communism in the third world. This did not happen, as evidenced by Brezhnev&#x27;s continued military support for the communist guerillas fighting against the U.S. during the Vietnam War.

After Gerald Ford lost the presidential election to Jimmy Carter, American foreign policies became more overtly aggressive in vocabulary towards the Soviet Union and the communist world. Attempts were also made to stop funding for repressive anti-communist governments and organizations the United States supported. While at first standing for a decrease in all defense initiatives, the later years of Carter&#x27;s presidency would increase spending on the U.S. military. When Brezhnev authorized the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, Carter, following the advice of his National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, denounced the intervention, describing it as the &quot;most serious danger to peace since 1945&quot;. The U.S. stopped all grain exports to the Soviet Union and boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow. The Soviet Union responded by boycotting the 1984 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles.

During Brezhnev&#x27;s rule, the Soviet Union reached the peak of its political and strategic power in relation to the United States. As a result of the limits agreed to by both superpowers in the first SALT Treaty, the Soviet Union obtained parity in nuclear weapons with the United States for the first time in the Cold War. Additionally, as a result of negotiations during the Helsinki Accords, Brezhnev succeeded in securing the legitimization of Soviet hegemony over Central and Eastern Europe.

====Intervention in Afghanistan====

After the communist revolution in Afghanistan in 1978, authoritarian actions forced upon the populace by the Communist regime led to the Afghan civil war, with the mujahideen leading the popular backlash against the regime. The Soviet Union was worried that they were losing their influence in Central Asia, so after a KGB report claimed that Afghanistan could be taken in a matter of weeks, Brezhnev and several top party officials agreed to a full intervention. Contemporary researchers tend to believe that Brezhnev had been misinformed on the situation in Afghanistan.His health had decayed, and proponents of direct military intervention took over the majority group in the Politburo by cheating and using falsified evidence. They advocated a relatively moderate scenario, maintaining a cadre of 1,500 to 2,500 Soviet military advisers and technicians in the country (which had already been there in large numbers since the 1950s), but they disagreed on sending regular army units in hundreds of thousands of troops. Some believe that Brezhnev&#x27;s signature on the decree was obtained without telling him the full story, otherwise he would have never approved such a decision. Soviet ambassador to the U.S. Anatoly Dobrynin believed that the real mastermind behind the invasion, who misinformed Brezhnev, was Mikhail Suslov. Brezhnev&#x27;s personal physician Mikhail Kosarev later recalled that Brezhnev, when he was in his right mind, in fact resisted the full-scale intervention. Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Vladimir Zhirinovsky stated officially that despite the military solution being supported by some, hardline Defense Minister Dmitry Ustinov was the only Politburo member who insisted on sending regular army units. Parts of the Soviet military establishment were opposed to any sort of active Soviet military presence in Afghanistan, believing that the Soviet Union should leave Afghan politics alone.

====The Brezhnev Doctrine====

In the aftermath of the Prague Spring&#x27;s suppression, Brezhnev announced that the Soviet Union had the right to interfere in the internal affairs of its satellites to &quot;safeguard socialism&quot;. This became known as the Brezhnev Doctrine, although it was really a restatement of existing Soviet policy, as enacted by Khrushchev in Hungary in 1956. Brezhnev reiterated the doctrine in a speech at the Fifth Congress of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party on 13 November 1968:

Later in 1980, a political crisis emerged in Poland with the emergence of the Solidarity movement. By the end of October, Solidarity had 3 million members, and by December, had 9 million. In a public opinion poll organised by the Polish government, 89% of the respondents supported Solidarity. With the Polish leadership split on what to do, the majority did not want to impose martial law, as suggested by Wojciech Jaruzelski. The Soviet Union and other states of the Eastern Bloc were unsure how to handle the situation, but Erich Honecker of East Germany pressed for military action. In a formal letter to Brezhnev, Honecker proposed a joint military measure to control the escalating problems in Poland. A CIA report suggested the Soviet military were mobilizing for an invasion.

In 1980–81 representatives from the Eastern Bloc nations met at the Kremlin to discuss the Polish situation. Brezhnev eventually concluded on 1981 that it would be better to leave the domestic matters of Poland alone, reassuring the Polish delegates that the USSR would intervene only if asked to. This effectively marked the end of the Brezhnev Doctrine. Notwithstanding the absence of a Soviet military intervention, Wojciech Jaruzelski ultimately gave in to Moscow&#x27;s demands by imposing a state of war, the Polish version of martial law, on 13 December 1981.

===Cult of personality===

The last years of Brezhnev&#x27;s rule were marked by a growing personality cult. His love of medals (he received over 100) was well known, so in December 1966, on his 60th birthday, he was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union. Brezhnev received the award, which came with the Order of Lenin and the Gold Star, three more times in celebration of his birthdays. On his 70th birthday he was awarded the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union&#x27;s highest military honour. After being awarded the rank, he attended an 18th Army Veterans meeting, dressed in a long coat and saying &quot;Attention, the Marshal is coming!&quot; He also conferred upon himself the rare Order of Victory in 1978, which was posthumously revoked in 1989 for not meeting the criteria for citation. A promotion to the rank of Generalissimo of the Soviet Union, planned for Brezhnev&#x27;s seventy-fifth birthday, was quietly shelved due to his ongoing health problems.

Brezhnev&#x27;s eagerness for undeserved glory was shown by his poorly written memoirs recalling his military service during World War II, which treated the minor battles near Novorossiysk as a decisive military theatre. Despite his book&#x27;s apparent weaknesses, it was awarded the Lenin Prize for Literature and was hailed by the Soviet press. The book was followed by two other books, one on the Virgin Lands campaign.

===Health problems===
Brezhnev&#x27;s personality cult was growing at a time when his health was in rapid decline. His physical condition was deteriorating; he had been a heavy smoker until the 1970s, had become addicted to sleeping pills and tranquilizers, and had begun drinking to excess. His niece Lyubov Brezhneva attributed his dependencies and overall decline to severe depression caused by, in addition to the stress of his job and the general situation of the country, an extremely unhappy family life, with near-daily conflicts with his wife and children, in particular his troubled daughter Galina, whose erratic behavior, failed marriages and involvement in corruption took a heavy toll on Brezhnev&#x27;s mental and physical health. Brezhnev had considered divorcing his wife and disowning his children many times, but intervention from his extended family and the Politburo, fearing negative publicity, managed to dissuade him. 

Over the years Brezhnev had become overweight. From 1973 until his death, his central nervous system underwent chronic deterioration and he had several minor strokes as well as insomnia. In 1975 he suffered his first heart attack. When receiving the Order of Lenin, Brezhnev walked shakily and fumbled his words. According to one American intelligence expert, United States officials knew for several years that Brezhnev had suffered from severe arteriosclerosis and believed he had suffered from other unspecified ailments as well. In 1977, American intelligence officials publicly suggested that Brezhnev had also been suffering from gout, leukemia and emphysema from decades of heavy smoking, as well as chronic bronchitis. He was reported to have been fitted with a pacemaker to control his heart rhythm abnormalities. On occasion, he was known to have suffered from memory loss, speaking problems and had difficulties with coordination. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;All of this is also reported to be taking its toll on Brezhnev&#x27;s mood. He is said to be depressed, despondent over his own failing health and discouraged by the death of many of his long-time colleagues. To help, he has turned to regular counseling and hypnosis by an Assyrian woman, a sort of modern-day Rasputin.&quot;

According to Nursultan Nazarbayev’s memoir, My Life, an incident occurred in Alma-Ata during a reception for Brezhnev at the Auezov Theater. About a thousand guests had gathered, and after they were seated, Dinmukhamed Kunaev proposed a toast to Brezhnev. However, as soon as the guests raised their glasses, Brezhnev unexpectedly stood up and headed toward the exit, prompting the entire republic’s leadership to follow him. Brezhnev walked outside, approached his car, and within a minute, the motorcade was on its way. Nazarbayev noted that it was evident Brezhnev had forgotten the purpose of his visit, but those around him pretended not to notice his frail state.

Upon suffering a stroke in 1975, Brezhnev&#x27;s ability to lead the Soviet Union was significantly compromised. As his ability to define Soviet foreign policy weakened, he increasingly deferred to the opinions of a hardline brain trust comprising KGB Chairman Yuri Andropov, longtime foreign minister Andrei Gromyko, and Defense Minister Andrei Grechko (who was succeeded by Dmitriy Ustinov in 1976).

The Ministry of Health kept doctors by Brezhnev&#x27;s side at all times, and he was brought back from near death on several occasions. At this time, most senior officers of the CPSU wanted to keep Brezhnev alive. Even though an increasing number of officials were frustrated with his policies, no one in the regime wanted to risk a new period of domestic turmoil which might be caused by his death. Western commentators started guessing who Brezhnev&#x27;s heir apparent was. The most notable candidates were Mikhail Suslov and Andrei Kirilenko, who were both older than Brezhnev, and Fyodor Kulakov and Konstantin Chernenko, who were younger; Kulakov died of natural causes in 1978.

===Last years and death===
Brezhnev&#x27;s health worsened in the winter of 1981–82. While the Politburo was pondering the question of who would succeed, all signs indicated that the ailing leader was dying. The choice of the successor would have been influenced by Suslov, but he died at the age of 79 in January 1982. Andropov took Suslov&#x27;s seat in the Central Committee Secretariat; by May, it became obvious that Andropov would make a bid for the office of the General Secretary. With the help of fellow KGB associates, he started circulating rumors that political corruption had become worse during Brezhnev&#x27;s tenure as leader, in an attempt to create an environment hostile to Brezhnev in the Politburo. Andropov&#x27;s actions showed that he was not afraid of Brezhnev&#x27;s wrath.

In March 1982 Brezhnev received a concussion and fractured his right clavicle while touring a factory in Tashkent, after a metal balustrade collapsed under the weight of a number of factory workers, falling on top of Brezhnev and his security detail. This incident was reported in Western media as Brezhnev having suffered a stroke. After a month-long recovery, Brezhnev worked intermittently through November. On 7 November 1982, he was present standing on the Lenin&#x27;s Mausoleum&#x27;s balcony during the annual military parade and demonstration of workers commemorating the 65th anniversary of the October Revolution. The event marked Brezhnev&#x27;s final public appearance before dying three days later after suffering a heart attack. He was honored with a state funeral after a three-day period of nationwide mourning. He was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in Red Square, in one of the twelve individual tombs located between the Lenin&#x27;s Mausoleum and the Moscow Kremlin Wall. A number of countries including Cuba, Nicaragua, Mozambique, Afghanistan, India and others had declared national mourning over his death.

National and international statesmen from around the globe attended his funeral. His wife and family were also present. Brezhnev was dressed for burial in his Marshal&#x27;s uniform along with his medals.

==Legacy==

Brezhnev presided over the Soviet Union for longer than any other person except Joseph Stalin. He is remembered for donning the mantle of a peacemaker and a common-sense statesman. He is often criticised for the prolonged Era of Stagnation, in which fundamental economic problems were ignored and the Soviet political system was allowed to decline. During Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s tenure as leader there was a sharp increase in criticism of Brezhnev&#x27;s leadership, including claims that he followed &quot;a fierce neo-Stalinist line&quot; while consistently failing to modernize the country and change with the times. The intervention in Afghanistan, which was one of the major decisions of his career, also significantly undermined both the international standing and the internal strength of the Soviet Union. 

Brezhnev fared better when compared to his successors and predecessors in Russia. In a 1999 poll, he ranked as the best Russian leader of the 20th century. In an opinion poll by VTsIOM in 2007 the majority of Russians chose to live during the Brezhnev era rather than any other period of 20th century Soviet history. In a Levada Center poll conducted in 2013, Brezhnev beat Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin (respectively) as Russia&#x27;s favorite leader in the 20th century with 56% approval. In another poll in 2013, Brezhnev was voted the best Russian leader of the 20th century. In a 2018 Rating Sociological Group poll, 47% of Ukrainian respondents had a positive opinion of Brezhnev.

In the West, stagnation hypothesis is generally accepted with regards to the rule of Brezhnev.

==Personality traits==

Russian historian Roy Medvedev emphasizes the bureaucratic mentality and personality strengths that enabled Brezhnev to gain power. He was loyal to his friends, vain in desiring ceremonial power, and refused to control corruption inside the party. Especially in foreign affairs, Brezhnev increasingly took all major decisions into his own hands, without telling his colleagues in the Politburo. He deliberately presented a different persona to different people, culminating in the systematic glorification of his own career.

Brezhnev&#x27;s vanity made him the target of many political jokes. Nikolai Podgorny warned him of this, but Brezhnev replied, &quot;If they are poking fun at me, it means they like me.&quot;

In keeping with traditional socialist greetings, Brezhnev kissed many politicians on the lips during his career. One of these occasions, with Erich Honecker, was the subject of &quot;My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love&quot;, a mural painted on the Berlin Wall after its opening and dismantlement.

Brezhnev&#x27;s main passion was driving foreign cars given to him by leaders of state from across the world. He usually drove these between his dacha and the Kremlin with, according to historian Robert Service, flagrant disregard for public safety. When visiting the United States for a summit with Richard Nixon in 1973, he expressed a wish to drive around Washington in a Lincoln Continental that Nixon had just given him; upon being told that the Secret Service would not allow him to do this, he said &quot;I will take the flag off the car, put on dark glasses, so they can&#x27;t see my eyebrows and drive like any American would&quot; to which Henry Kissinger replied &quot;I have driven with you and I don&#x27;t think you drive like an American!&quot;

==Personal life==

Brezhnev was married to Viktoria Denisova (1908–1995). He had a daughter, Galina, and a son, Yuri. His niece Lyubov Brezhneva published a memoir in 1995 which claimed that Brezhnev worked systematically to bring privileges to his family in terms of appointments, apartments, private luxury stores, private medical facilities and immunity from prosecution. Brezhnev had an apartment at 26 Kutuzovsky Prospekt, the same building in which Mikhail Suslov and Yuri Andropov lived.

==Honours==

Brezhnev received several accolades and honours from his home country and foreign countries. Among his foreign honours are the Bangladesh Liberation War Honour and the Hero of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic.

<text>The Battle of Stoke Field, which took place at East Stoke, Nottinghamshire, on 16 June 1487, may be considered the last battle of the Wars of the Roses, since it was the last major engagement between contenders for the throne whose claims derived from descent from the houses of Lancaster and York. The Battle of Bosworth Field, two years previously, had established Henry VII on the throne, ending the last period of Yorkist rule and initiating that of the Tudors. The Battle of Stoke Field was the decisive engagement in an attempt by leading Ricardian Yorkists to unseat the King in favour of the pretender Lambert Simnel.

Though it is often portrayed as almost a footnote to the major battles between York and Lancaster, it may have been slightly larger than Bosworth, with much heavier casualties, possibly because of the terrain which forced the two sides into close, attritional combat. In the end, though, Henry&#x27;s victory was crushing. Almost all the leading Yorkists were killed in the battle.

==Pretender==
Henry VII of England held the throne for the new royal line (the House of Tudor), and had tried to gain the acceptance of the Yorkist faction by his marriage to their senior heiress, Elizabeth of York, but his hold on power was not entirely secure. The chief male-line claimant of the York dynasty was the queen&#x27;s first cousin, Edward, Earl of Warwick, the son of George, Duke of Clarence. This boy was kept confined in the Tower of London.

An impostor claiming to be Edward (usually identified as Edward, Earl of Warwick, but may have initially begun by claiming to be one of the princes in the tower), whose name was Lambert Simnel, came to the attention of John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, through the agency of a priest called Richard Symonds. Lincoln, although apparently reconciled with the Tudor king, had a claim on the throne; the last Plantagenet, Richard III of England, had named Lincoln, his nephew, as the royal heir. Although he probably had no doubt about Simnel&#x27;s true identity, Lincoln saw an opportunity for revenge and reparation.

Lincoln fled the English court on 19 March 1487 and went to the court of Mechelen (Malines) and his aunt, Margaret, Duchess of Burgundy. Margaret provided financial and military support in the form of 2,000 German and Swiss mercenaries, under the commander Martin Schwartz. Lincoln was joined by a number of rebel English Lords at Mechelen, in particular Richard III&#x27;s loyal supporter, Lord Lovell, Sir Richard Harleston, the former governor of Jersey and Thomas David, a captain of the English garrison at Calais. The Yorkists decided to sail to Ireland, where the Yorkist cause was popular, to gather more supporters.

==Yorkist rebellion==

The Yorkist fleet set sail and arrived in Dublin on 4 May 1487. With the help of Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare, and his brother Thomas FitzGerald of Laccagh, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Lincoln recruited 4,500 Irish mercenaries, mostly kerns, lightly armoured but highly mobile infantry. With the support of the Irish nobility and clergy, Lincoln had the pretender Simnel crowned &quot;King Edward VI&quot; in Dublin on 24 May 1487. Although a parliament was called for the new &quot;king&quot;, Lincoln had no intention of remaining in Dublin and instead packed up the army and Simnel and set sail for north Lancashire.

On landing on 4 June 1487, Lincoln was joined by a number of the local gentry led by Sir Thomas Broughton. In a series of forced marches, the Yorkist army, now numbering some 8,000 men, covered over 200 miles in five days. On the night of 10 June, the Yorkists were camped at Bramham moor, and the pro-Tudor forces under Clifford were camped near Tadcaster. Lovell led 2,000 Yorkists on a night attack against Clifford&#x27;s 400 men. The result was an overwhelming Yorkist victory. Lincoln then outmanoeuvred King Henry&#x27;s northern army, under the command of the Earl of Northumberland, by ordering a force under John, Lord Scrope, to mount a diversionary attack on Bootham Bar, York, on 12 June. Lord Scrope then withdrew northwards, taking Northumberland&#x27;s army with him.

Lincoln and the main army continued southwards. Outside Doncaster, Lincoln encountered Lancastrian cavalry under Edward Woodville, Lord Scales. There followed three days of skirmishing through Sherwood Forest. Lincoln forced Scales back to Nottingham, where Scales&#x27; cavalry stayed to wait for the main royal army. However, the fighting had slowed down the Yorkist advance sufficiently to allow King Henry to receive substantial reinforcements under the command of Lord Strange by the time he joined Scales at Nottingham on 14 June. Rhys ap Thomas, Henry&#x27;s leading supporter in Wales, also arrived with reinforcements. Henry&#x27;s army now outnumbered the Yorkists. In addition, it was &quot;far better armed and equipped&quot; than the Yorkist army. His two principal military commanders, Jasper Tudor and John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, were also more experienced than the Yorkist leaders.

==Battle==
On 15 June, King Henry began moving northeast toward Newark after receiving news that Lincoln had crossed the River Trent. Around nine in the morning of 16 June, King Henry&#x27;s forward troops, commanded by the Earl of Oxford, encountered the Yorkist army assembled in a single block, on a brow of Rampire Hill surrounded on three sides by the River Trent at the village of East Stoke. Their right flank was anchored on a high spot known as Burham Furlong.

Henry&#x27;s army was divided into three battles, of which Oxford led the vanguard, he may have had as many as 6,000 infantry under his command, flanked by two wings of mounted troops under Baron Scales and Sir John Savage (both veterans of Bosworth). As at Bosworth, the King left the direction of the fighting itself to Oxford. Before the fight began some unusual lights in the sky were interpreted as ill-portents by Lancastrian soldiers, leading to some desertions, but Oxford and other nobles were able to restore morale, and soon the army was in &quot;good array and in a fair battle&quot;.

The Yorkists, arrayed in a single concentrated formation, were assaulted by arrows. Suffering from the missiles, they chose to surrender the high ground by immediately going on to the attack in the hope of breaking the Lancastrian line and rolling up the enemy army. Though outnumbered overall, the Yorkists had the advantage of a &quot;core of well-trained foreign mercenaries&quot;, and their concentrated force outnumbered Oxford&#x27;s vanguard, which was the only part of the Lancastrian army engaged.

The vanguard was badly shaken, but Oxford was able to rally his force. The battle was bitterly contested for over three hours, but eventually sheer attrition told against the Yorkists after they failed to break the Lancastrian position early on. Henry chose not to commit his other &quot;battles&quot;, leaving the struggle to the vanguard, which was probably repeatedly reinforced as Lancastrian contingents came up, directed by Jasper Tudor. Though the German mercenaries were equipped with the latest handguns, the presence of large numbers of traditional archers in the Lancastrian army proved decisive. The skilled longbowmen were able to shoot volley after volley into the Yorkist position. The lack of body armour on the Irish troops in particular meant that they were cut down in increasing numbers by repeated showers of arrows.

Unable to retreat (with the river on three sides), the German and Swiss mercenaries fought it out. According to Jean Molinet, by the end of the battle, they were &quot;filled with arrows like hedgehogs&quot;. The broken Yorkists fled towards the Trent down a ravine (known locally even today as the Red Gutter) in which many were cornered and killed. Most of the Yorkist commanders—Lincoln, Fitzgerald, and Schwartz—fell fighting. Only Lord Lovell and Broughton may have escaped. Lovell disappeared after the battle and was never seen again. He may have gone to Scotland, as there is evidence of a safe conduct pass being granted him there, but his later fate is unknown. In the 18th century a body was found inside a secret room at his house, Minster Lovell Hall in Minster Lovell, Oxfordshire, leading to conjecture that it was his.

==Aftermath==
Simnel was captured, but was pardoned by Henry in a gesture of clemency which did his reputation no harm. Henry realised that Simnel was merely a puppet for the leading Yorkists. He was given a job in the royal kitchen as a spit-turner, and later promoted to falconer. The Irish nobles who had supported Simnel were also pardoned, as Henry believed he needed their support to govern Ireland effectively. However, Henry later persuaded the Pope to excommunicate the Irish clergy who had supported the rebellion. Two other Yorkist conspirators were also captured: Richard Symonds and John Payne, Bishop of Meath. Symonds was the man who had introduced Lincoln to Simnel; Payne had preached the sermon at Simnel&#x27;s coronation. Neither was executed: Symonds was imprisoned, and Payne was pardoned and eventually restored to royal favour.

To mark his victory, Henry raised his standard on Burham Furlong. The spot is marked by a large stone memorial with the legend &quot;Here stood the Burrand Bush planted on the spot where Henry VII placed his standard after the Battle of Stoke 16 June 1487&quot;. Henry knighted many of his supporters in the aftermath of the battle. A handwritten list of the new knights by John Writhe survives inserted into a copy of the book &quot;Game and Play of Chess&quot;. Thirteen new bannerets were created and fifty-two men were knighted. The following year in 1488 the two main cavalry commanders of Henry&#x27;s army, Baron Scales and Sir John Savage, were both made Knights of the Garter.

Henry had hoped to capture Lincoln alive in order to learn from him the true extent of support for the Yorkists. Instead, Henry launched a series of enquiries, the outcome of which was &quot;relatively few executions and very many fines&quot;, consistent with Henry&#x27;s policy of controlling the aristocracy by weakening it financially. After the battle, he progressed north through Pontefract, York, Durham, and Newcastle to show himself in those areas that had been strongholds of Richard III&#x27;s supporters. Later in Henry&#x27;s reign, in the 1490s, another pretender to the throne emerged, in the person of Perkin Warbeck; this time the matter was resolved without having to fight a battle, in the Second Cornish uprising of 1497.

<text>Louis Victor Pierre Raymond, 7th Duc de Broglie (, ; ; 15 August 1892 – 19 March 1987) was a French physicist and aristocrat known for his contributions to quantum theory. In his 1924 PhD thesis, he postulated the wave nature of electrons and suggested that all matter has wave properties. This concept is known as the de Broglie hypothesis, an example of wave-particle duality, and forms a central part of the theory of quantum mechanics.

De Broglie won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1929, after the wave-like behaviour of matter was first experimentally demonstrated in 1927.

The wave-like behaviour of particles discovered by de Broglie was used by Erwin Schrödinger in his formulation of wave mechanics.
De Broglie&#x27;s pilot-wave concept, was presented at the 1927 Solvay Conferences then abandoned, in favor of the quantum mechanics, until 1952 when it was rediscovered and enhanced by David Bohm.

Louis de Broglie was the sixteenth member elected to occupy seat 1 of the Académie française in 1944, and served as Perpetual Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences. De Broglie became the first high-level scientist to call for establishment of a multi-national laboratory, a proposal that led to the establishment of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).

== Biography ==

=== Family and education ===
Louis de Broglie belonged to the famous aristocratic family of Broglie, whose representatives for several centuries occupied important military and political posts in France. The father of the future physicist, Louis-Alphonse-Victor, 5th duc de Broglie, was married to Pauline d’Armaille, the granddaughter of the Napoleonic General Philippe Paul, comte de Ségur and his wife, the biographer, Marie Célestine Amélie d&#x27;Armaillé. They had five children; in addition to Louis, these were: Albertina (1872–1946), subsequently the Marquise de Luppé; Maurice (1875–1960), subsequently a famous experimental physicist; Philip (1881–1890), who died two years before the birth of Louis, and Pauline, Comtesse de Pange (1888–1972), subsequently a famous writer. 

Louis was born in Dieppe, Seine-Maritime. As the youngest child in the family, Louis grew up in relative loneliness, read a lot, and was fond of history, especially political. From early childhood, he had a good memory and could accurately read an excerpt from a theatrical production or give a complete list of ministers of the Third Republic of France. For this, he was predicted to become a great statesman in the future.

De Broglie had intended a career in humanities, and received his first degree (&quot;licence ès lettres&quot;) in history. Afterwards he turned his attention toward mathematics and physics and received a degree (&quot;licence ès sciences&quot;) in physics. With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, he offered his services to the army in the development of radio communications.

=== Military service ===

After graduation, Louis de Broglie joined the engineering forces to undergo compulsory service. It began at Fort Mont Valérien, but soon, on the initiative of his brother, he was seconded to the Wireless Communications Service and worked on the Eiffel Tower, where the radio transmitter was located. Louis de Broglie remained in military service throughout the First World War, dealing with purely technical issues. In particular, together with Léon Brillouin and brother Maurice, he participated in establishing wireless communications with submarines. Louis de Broglie was demobilized in August 1919 with the rank of adjudant. Later, the scientist regretted that he had to spend about six years away from the fundamental problems of science that interested him.

=== Scientific and pedagogical career ===
His 1924 thesis &quot;Recherches sur la théorie des quanta&quot; (Research on the Theory of the Quanta) introduced his theory of electron waves. This included the wave–particle duality theory of matter, based on the work of Max Planck and Albert Einstein on light. This research culminated in the de Broglie hypothesis stating that &quot;any moving particle or object had an associated wave&quot;. De Broglie thus created a new field in physics, the &quot;mécanique ondulatoire&quot;, or wave mechanics, uniting the physics of energy (wave) and matter (particle). He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1929 &quot;for his discovery of the wave nature of electrons&quot;.

In his later career, de Broglie worked to develop a causal explanation of wave mechanics, in opposition to the wholly probabilistic models which dominate quantum mechanical theory; it was refined by David Bohm in the 1950s. The theory has since been known as the De Broglie–Bohm theory.

In addition to strictly scientific work, de Broglie thought and wrote about the philosophy of science, including the value of modern scientific discoveries. In 1930 he founded the book series Actualités scientifiques et industrielles published by Éditions Hermann.

De Broglie became a member of the Académie des sciences in 1933, and was the academy&#x27;s perpetual secretary from 1942. He was asked to join &quot;Le Conseil de l&#x27;Union Catholique des Scientifiques Francais&quot;, but declined because he was non-religious.
In 1941, he was made a member of the National Council of Vichy France. On 12 October 1944, he was elected to the Académie Française, replacing mathematician Émile Picard. Because of the deaths and imprisonments of Académie members during the occupation and other effects of the war, the Académie was unable to meet the quorum of twenty members for his election; due to the exceptional circumstances, however, his unanimous election by the seventeen members present was accepted. In an event unique in the history of the Académie, he was received as a member by his own brother Maurice, who had been elected in 1934. UNESCO awarded him the first Kalinga Prize in 1952 for his work in popularizing scientific knowledge, and he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society on 23 April 1953.

Louis became the 7th duc de Broglie in 1960 upon the death without heir of his elder brother, Maurice, 6th duc de Broglie, also a physicist.

In 1961, he received the title of Knight of the Grand Cross in the Légion d&#x27;honneur. De Broglie was awarded a post as counselor to the French High Commission of Atomic Energy in 1945 for his efforts to bring industry and science closer together. He established a center for applied mechanics at the Henri Poincaré Institute, where research into optics, cybernetics, and atomic energy were carried out. He inspired the formation of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science and was an early member.

Louis never married. When he died on 19 March 1987 in Louveciennes at the age of 94, he was succeeded as duke by a distant cousin, Victor-François, 8th duc de Broglie. His funeral was held 23 March 1987 at the Church of Saint-Pierre-de-Neuilly.

== Scientific activity ==
=== Physics of X-ray and photoelectric effect ===
The first works of Louis de Broglie (early 1920s) were performed in the laboratory of his older brother Maurice and dealt with the features of the photoelectric effect and the properties of x-rays. These publications examined the absorption of X-rays and described this phenomenon using the Bohr theory, applied quantum principles to the interpretation of photoelectron spectra, and gave a systematic classification of X-ray spectra. The studies of X-ray spectra were important for elucidating the structure of the internal electron shells of atoms (optical spectra are determined by the outer shells). Thus, the results of experiments conducted together with Alexandre Dauvillier, revealed the shortcomings of the existing schemes for the distribution of electrons in atoms; these difficulties were eliminated by Edmund Stoner. Another result was the elucidation of the insufficiency of the Sommerfeld formula for determining the position of lines in X-ray spectra; this discrepancy was eliminated after the discovery of the electron spin. In 1925 and 1926, Leningrad physicist Orest Khvolson nominated the de Broglie brothers for the Nobel Prize for their work in the field of X-rays.

=== Matter and wave–particle duality ===

Studying the nature of X-ray radiation and discussing its properties with his brother Maurice, who considered these rays to be some kind of combination of waves and particles, contributed to Louis de Broglie&#x27;s awareness of the need to build a theory linking particle and wave representations. In addition, he was familiar with the works (1919–1922) of Marcel Brillouin, which proposed a hydrodynamic model of an atom and attempted to relate it to the results of Bohr&#x27;s theory. The starting point in the work of Louis de Broglie was the idea of Einstein about the quanta of light. In his first article on this subject, published in 1922, the French scientist considered blackbody radiation as a gas of light quanta and, using classical statistical mechanics, derived the Wien radiation law in the framework of such a representation. In his next publication, he tried to reconcile the concept of light quanta with the phenomena of interference and diffraction and came to the conclusion that it was necessary to associate a certain periodicity with quanta. In this case, light quanta were interpreted by him as relativistic particles of very small mass.

It remained to extend the wave considerations to any massive particles, and in the summer of 1923 a decisive breakthrough occurred. De Broglie outlined his ideas in a short note &quot;Waves and quanta&quot; (, presented at a meeting of the Paris Academy of Sciences on September 10, 1923), which marked the beginning of the creation of wave mechanics. In this paper and his subsequent PhD thesis, the scientist suggested that a moving particle with energy &quot;E&quot; and velocity v is characterized by some internal periodic process with a frequency formula_1 (later known as Compton frequency), where formula_2 is the Planck constant. To reconcile these considerations, based on the quantum principle, with the ideas of special relativity, de Broglie associated wave he called a &quot;phase wave&quot; with a moving body, which propagates with the phase velocity formula_3. Such a wave, which later received the name matter wave, or de Broglie wave, in the process of body movement remains in phase with the internal periodic process. Having then examined the motion of an electron in a closed orbit, the scientist showed that the requirement for phase matching directly leads to the quantum Bohr-Sommerfeld condition, that is, to quantize the angular momentum. In the next two notes (reported at the meetings on September 24 and October 8, respectively), de Broglie came to the conclusion that the particle velocity is equal to the group velocity of phase waves, and the particle moves along the normal to surfaces of equal phase. In the general case, the trajectory of a particle can be determined using Fermat&#x27;s principle (for waves) or the principle of least action (for particles), which indicates a connection between geometric optics and classical mechanics.

This theory set the basis of wave mechanics. It was supported by Einstein, confirmed by the electron diffraction experiments of G P Thomson and Davisson and Germer, and generalized by the work of Erwin Schrödinger.

From a philosophical viewpoint, this theory of matter-waves has contributed greatly to the ruin of the atomism of the past. Originally, de Broglie thought that real wave (i.e., having a direct physical interpretation) was associated with particles. In fact, the wave aspect of matter was formalized by a wavefunction defined by the Schrödinger equation, which is a pure mathematical entity having a probabilistic interpretation, without the support of real physical elements. This wavefunction gives an appearance of wave behavior to matter, without making real physical waves appear. However, until the end of his life de Broglie returned to a direct and real physical interpretation of matter-waves, following the work of David Bohm.

=== Conjecture of an internal clock of the electron ===

In his 1924 thesis, de Broglie conjectured that the electron has an internal clock that constitutes part of the mechanism by which a pilot wave guides a particle. Subsequently, David Hestenes has proposed a link to the zitterbewegung that was suggested by Schrödinger.

While attempts at verifying the internal clock hypothesis and measuring clock frequency are so far not conclusive, recent experimental data is at least compatible with de Broglie&#x27;s conjecture.

=== Non-nullity and variability of mass ===
According to de Broglie, the neutrino and the photon have rest masses that are non-zero, though very low. That a photon is not quite massless is imposed by the coherence of his theory. Incidentally, this rejection of the hypothesis of a massless photon enabled him to doubt the hypothesis of the expansion of the universe.

In addition, he believed that the true mass of particles is not constant, but variable, and that each particle can be represented as a thermodynamic machine equivalent to a cyclic integral of action.

=== Generalization of the principle of least action ===

In the second part of his 1924 thesis, de Broglie used the equivalence of the mechanical principle of least action with Fermat&#x27;s optical principle: &quot;Fermat&#x27;s principle applied to phase waves is identical to Maupertuis&#x27; principle applied to the moving body; the possible dynamic trajectories of the moving body are identical to the possible rays of the wave.&quot; This latter equivalence had been pointed out by William Rowan Hamilton a century earlier, and published by him around 1830, for the case of light.

=== Duality of the laws of nature ===
Far from claiming to make &quot;the contradiction disappear&quot; which Max Born thought could be achieved with a statistical approach, de Broglie extended wave–particle duality to all particles (and to crystals which revealed the effects of diffraction) and extended the principle of duality to the laws of nature.

His last work made a single system of laws from the two large systems of thermodynamics and of mechanics:

That idea seems to match the continuous–discontinuous duality, since its dynamics could be the limit of its thermodynamics when transitions to continuous limits are postulated. It is also close to that of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who posited the necessity of &quot;architectonic principles&quot; to complete the system of mechanical laws.

However, according to him, there is less duality, in the sense of opposition, than synthesis (one is the limit of the other) and the effort of synthesis is constant according to him, like in his first formula, in which the first member pertains to mechanics and the second to optics:
: formula_4

=== Neutrino theory of light ===

This theory, which dates from 1934, introduces the idea that the photon is equivalent to the fusion of two Dirac neutrinos. In 1938, the concept was challenged as not rotationally invariant and work on the concept was largedly discontinued.

=== Hidden thermodynamics ===
De Broglie&#x27;s final idea was the hidden thermodynamics of isolated particles. It is an attempt to bring together the three furthest principles of physics: the principles of Fermat, Maupertuis, and Carnot.

In this work, action becomes a sort of opposite to entropy, through an equation that relates the only two universal dimensions of the form:
: formula_5
As a consequence of its great impact, this theory brings back the uncertainty principle to distances around extrema of action, distances corresponding to &quot;reductions in entropy&quot;.

<text>Jellyfish, also known as sea jellies, are the medusa-phase of certain gelatinous members of the subphylum Medusozoa, which is a major part of the phylum Cnidaria. 

Jellyfish are mainly free-swimming marine animals, although a few are anchored to the seabed by stalks rather than being motile. They are made of an umbrella-shaped main body made of mesoglea, known as the &quot;bell&quot;, and a collection of trailing tentacles on the underside. Via pulsating contractions, the bell can provide propulsion for locomotion through open water. The tentacles are armed with stinging cells and may be used to capture prey or to defend against predators. Jellyfish have a complex life cycle, and the medusa is normally the sexual phase, which produces planula larvae. These then disperse widely and enter a sedentary polyp phase which may include asexual budding before reaching sexual maturity.

Jellyfish are found all over the world, from surface waters to the deep sea. Scyphozoans (the &quot;true jellyfish&quot;) are exclusively marine, but some hydrozoans with a similar appearance live in fresh water. Large, often colorful, jellyfish are common in coastal zones worldwide. The medusae of most species are fast-growing, and mature within a few months then die soon after breeding, but the polyp stage, attached to the seabed, may be much more long-lived. Jellyfish have been in existence for at least 500 million years, and possibly 700 million years or more, making them the oldest multi-organ animal group.

Jellyfish are eaten by humans in certain cultures. They are considered a delicacy in some Asian countries, where species in the Rhizostomeae order are pressed and salted to remove excess water. Australian researchers have described them as a &quot;perfect food&quot;: sustainable and protein-rich but relatively low in food energy.

They are also used in cell and molecular biology research, especially the green fluorescent protein used by some species for bioluminescence. This protein has been adapted as a fluorescent reporter for inserted genes and has had a large impact on fluorescence microscopy. 

The stinging cells used by jellyfish to subdue their prey can injure humans. Thousands of swimmers worldwide are stung every year, with effects ranging from mild discomfort to serious injury or even death. When conditions are favourable, jellyfish can form vast swarms, which may damage fishing gear by filling fishing nets, and sometimes clog the cooling systems of power and desalination plants which draw their water from the sea.

== Names ==
The name jellyfish, in use since 1796, has traditionally been applied to medusae and all similar animals including the comb jellies (ctenophores, another phylum). The term &quot;jellies&quot; or &quot;sea jellies&quot; is more recent, having been introduced by public aquaria in an effort to avoid use of the word &quot;fish&quot; with its modern connotation of an animal with a backbone, though shellfish, cuttlefish and starfish are not vertebrates either. In scientific literature, &quot;jelly&quot; and &quot;jellyfish&quot; have been used interchangeably. Many sources refer to only scyphozoans as &quot;true jellyfish&quot;.

A group of jellyfish is called a &quot;smack&quot; or a &quot;smuck&quot;.

== Mapping to taxonomic groups ==
=== Phylogeny ===
==== Definition ====
The term jellyfish broadly corresponds to medusae, that is, a life-cycle stage in the Medusozoa. The American evolutionary biologist Paulyn Cartwright gives the following general definition:

The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines jellyfish as follows:

Given that jellyfish is a common name, its mapping to biological groups is inexact. Some authorities have called the comb jellies and certain salps jellyfish, though other authorities state that neither of these are jellyfish, which they consider should be limited to certain groups within the medusozoa.

The non-medusozoan clades called jellyfish by some but not all authorities (both agreeing and disagreeing citations are given in each case) are indicated with &quot;???&quot; on the following cladogram of the animal kingdom:

==== Medusozoan jellyfish ====

Jellyfish are not a clade, as they include most of the Medusozoa, barring some of the Hydrozoa. The medusozoan groups included by authorities are indicated on the following phylogenetic tree by the presence of citations. Names of included jellyfish, in English where possible, are shown in boldface; the presence of a named and cited example indicates that at least that species within its group has been called a jellyfish.

=== Taxonomy ===
The subphylum Medusozoa includes all cnidarians with a medusa stage in their life cycle. The basic cycle is egg, planula larva, polyp, medusa, with the medusa being the sexual stage. The polyp stage is sometimes secondarily lost. The subphylum include the major taxa, Scyphozoa (large jellyfish), Cubozoa (box jellyfish) and Hydrozoa (small jellyfish), and excludes Anthozoa (corals and sea anemones). This suggests that the medusa form evolved after the polyps. Medusozoans have tetramerous symmetry, with parts in fours or multiples of four.

The four major classes of medusozoan Cnidaria are:

* Scyphozoa are sometimes called true jellyfish, though they are no more truly jellyfish than the others listed here. They have tetra-radial symmetry. Most have tentacles around the outer margin of the bowl-shaped bell, and long, oral arms around the mouth in the center of the subumbrella.
* Cubozoa (box jellyfish) have a (rounded) box-shaped bell, and their velarium assists them to swim more quickly. Box jellyfish may be related more closely to scyphozoan jellyfish than either are to the Hydrozoa.
* Hydrozoa medusae also have tetra-radial symmetry, nearly always have a velum (diaphragm used in swimming) attached just inside the bell margin, do not have oral arms, but a much smaller central stalk-like structure, the manubrium, with terminal mouth opening, and are distinguished by the absence of cells in the mesoglea. Hydrozoa show great diversity of lifestyle; some species maintain the polyp form for their entire life and do not form medusae at all (such as Hydra, which is hence not considered a jellyfish), and a few are entirely medusal and have no polyp form.
* Staurozoa (stalked jellyfish) are characterized by a medusa form that is generally sessile, oriented upside down and with a stalk emerging from the apex of the &quot;calyx&quot; (bell), which attaches to the substrate. At least some Staurozoa also have a polyp form that alternates with the medusoid portion of the life cycle. Until recently, Staurozoa were classified within the Scyphozoa.

There are over 200 species of Scyphozoa, about 50 species of Staurozoa, about 50 species of Cubozoa, and the Hydrozoa includes about 1000–1500 species that produce medusae, but many more species that do not.

=== Fossil history ===


Since jellyfish have no hard parts, fossils are rare. The oldest unambiguous fossil of a free-swimming medusa is &quot;Burgessomedusa&quot; from the mid-Cambrian Burgess Shale of Canada, which is likely either a stem group of box jellyfish (Cubozoa) or Acraspeda (the clade including Staurozoa, Cubozoa, and Scyphozoa). Other claimed records from the Cambrian of China and Utah in the United States are uncertain, and possibly represent ctenophores instead.

== Anatomy ==

The main feature of a true jellyfish is the umbrella-shaped bell. This is a hollow structure consisting of a mass of transparent jelly-like matter known as mesoglea, which forms the hydrostatic skeleton of the animal. The mesoglea is 95% or more composed of water, and also contains collagen and other fibrous proteins, as well as wandering amebocytes that can engulf debris and bacteria. The mesogloea is bordered by the epidermis on the outside and the gastrodermis on the inside. The edge of the bell is often divided into rounded lobes known as lappets, which allow the bell to flex. In the gaps or niches between the lappets are dangling rudimentary sense organs known as rhopalia, and the margin of the bell often bears tentacles.

On the underside of the bell is the manubrium, a stalk-like structure hanging down from the centre, with the mouth, which also functions as the anus, at its tip. There are often four oral arms connected to the manubrium, streaming away into the water below. The mouth opens into the gastrovascular cavity, where digestion takes place and nutrients are absorbed. This is subdivided by four thick septa into a central stomach and four gastric pockets. The four pairs of gonads are attached to the septa, and close to them four septal funnels open to the exterior, perhaps supplying good oxygenation to the gonads. Near the free edges of the septa, gastric filaments extend into the gastric cavity; these are armed with nematocysts and enzyme-producing cells and play a role in subduing and digesting the prey. In some scyphozoans, the gastric cavity is joined to radial canals which branch extensively and may join a marginal ring canal. Cilia in these canals circulate the fluid in a regular direction.

The box jellyfish is largely similar in structure. It has a squarish, box-like bell. A short pedalium or stalk hangs from each of the four lower corners. One or more long, slender tentacles are attached to each pedalium. The rim of the bell is folded inwards to form a shelf known as a velarium which restricts the bell&#x27;s aperture and creates a powerful jet when the bell pulsates, allowing box jellyfish to swim faster than true jellyfish. Hydrozoans are also similar, usually with just four tentacles at the edge of the bell, although many hydrozoans are colonial and may not have a free-living medusal stage. In some species, a non-detachable bud known as a gonophore is formed that contains a gonad but is missing many other medusal features such as tentacles and rhopalia. Stalked jellyfish are attached to a solid surface by a basal disk, and resemble a polyp, the oral end of which has partially developed into a medusa with tentacle-bearing lobes and a central manubrium with four-sided mouth.

Most jellyfish do not have specialized systems for osmoregulation, respiration and circulation, and do not have a central nervous system. Nematocysts, which deliver the sting, are located mostly on the tentacles; true jellyfish also have them around the mouth and stomach. Jellyfish do not need a respiratory system because sufficient oxygen diffuses through the epidermis. They have limited control over their movement, but can navigate with the pulsations of the bell-like body; some species are active swimmers most of the time, while others largely drift.
The rhopalia contain rudimentary sense organs which are able to detect light, water-borne vibrations, odour and orientation. A loose network of nerves called a &quot;nerve net&quot; is located in the epidermis. Although traditionally thought not to have a central nervous system, nerve net concentration and ganglion-like structures could be considered to constitute one in most species. A jellyfish detects stimuli, and transmits impulses both throughout the nerve net and around a circular nerve ring, to other nerve cells. The rhopalial ganglia contain pacemaker neurones which control swimming rate and direction.

In many species of jellyfish, the rhopalia include ocelli, light-sensitive organs able to tell light from dark. These are generally pigment spot ocelli, which have some of their cells pigmented. The rhopalia are suspended on stalks with heavy crystals of calcium carbonate at one end, acting like gyroscopes to orient the eyes skyward. Certain jellyfish look upward at the mangrove canopy while making a daily migration from mangrove swamps into the open lagoon, where they feed, and back again.

Box jellyfish have more advanced vision than the other groups. Each individual has 24 eyes, two of which are capable of seeing colour, and four parallel information processing areas that act in competition, supposedly making them one of the few kinds of animal to have a 360-degree view of its environment.

=== Box jellyfish eye ===
The study of jellyfish eye evolution is an intermediary to a better understanding of how visual systems evolved on Earth. Jellyfish exhibit immense variation in visual systems ranging from photoreceptive cell patches seen in simple photoreceptive systems to more derived complex eyes seen in box jellyfish. Major topics of jellyfish visual system research (with an emphasis on box jellyfish) include: the evolution of jellyfish vision from simple to complex visual systems), the eye morphology and molecular structures of box jellyfish (including comparisons to vertebrate eyes), and various uses of vision including task-guided behaviors and niche specialization.

==== Evolution ====
Experimental evidence for photosensitivity and photoreception in cnidarians antecedes the mid 1900s, and a rich body of research has since covered evolution of visual systems in jellyfish. Jellyfish visual systems range from simple photoreceptive cells to complex image-forming eyes. More ancestral visual systems incorporate extraocular vision (vision without eyes) that encompass numerous receptors dedicated to single-function behaviors. More derived visual systems comprise perception that is capable of multiple task-guided behaviors.

Although they lack a true brain, cnidarian jellyfish have a &quot;ring&quot; nervous system that plays a significant role in motor and sensory activity. This net of nerves is responsible for muscle contraction and movement and culminates the emergence of photosensitive structures. Across Cnidaria, there is large variation in the systems that underlie photosensitivity. Photosensitive structures range from non-specialized groups of cells, to more &quot;conventional&quot; eyes similar to those of vertebrates. The general evolutionary steps to develop complex vision include (from more ancestral to more derived states): non-directional photoreception, directional photoreception, low-resolution vision, and high-resolution vision. Increased habitat and task complexity has favored the high-resolution visual systems common in derived cnidarians such as box jellyfish.

Basal visual systems observed in various cnidarians exhibit photosensitivity representative of a single task or behavior. Extraocular photoreception (a form of non-directional photoreception), is the most basic form of light sensitivity and guides a variety of behaviors among cnidarians. It can function to regulate circadian rhythm (as seen in eyeless hydrozoans) and other light-guided behaviors responsive to the intensity and spectrum of light. Extraocular photoreception can function additionally in positive phototaxis (in planula larvae of hydrozoans), as well as in avoiding harmful amounts of UV radiation via negative phototaxis. Directional photoreception (the ability to perceive direction of incoming light) allows for more complex phototactic responses to light, and likely evolved by means of membrane stacking. The resulting behavioral responses can range from guided spawning events timed by moonlight to shadow responses for potential predator avoidance. Light-guided behaviors are observed in numerous scyphozoans including the common moon jelly, &quot;Aurelia aurita&quot;, which migrates in response to changes in ambient light and solar position even though they lack proper eyes.

The low-resolution visual system of box jellyfish is more derived than directional photoreception, and thus box jellyfish vision represents the most basic form of true vision in which multiple directional photoreceptors combine to create the first imaging and spatial resolution. This is different from the high-resolution vision that is observed in camera or compound eyes of vertebrates and cephalopods that rely on focusing optics. Critically, the visual systems of box jellyfish are responsible for guiding multiple tasks or behaviors in contrast to less derived visual systems in other jellyfish that guide single behavioral functions. These behaviors include phototaxis based on sunlight (positive) or shadows (negative), obstacle avoidance, and control of swim-pulse rate.

Box jellyfish possess &quot;proper eyes&quot; (similar to vertebrates) that allow them to inhabit environments that lesser derived medusae cannot. In fact, they are considered the only class in the clade &quot;Medusozoa&quot; that have behaviors necessitating spatial resolution and genuine vision. However, the lens in their eyes are more functionally similar to cup-eyes exhibited in low-resolution organisms, and have very little to no focusing capability. The lack of the ability to focus is due to the focal length exceeding the distance to the retina, thus generating unfocused images and limiting spatial resolution. The visual system is still sufficient for box jellyfish to produce an image to help with tasks such as object avoidance.

==== Utility as a model organism ====
Box jellyfish eyes are a visual system that is sophisticated in numerous ways. These intricacies include the considerable variation within the morphology of box jellyfishes&#x27; eyes (including their task/behavior specification), and the molecular makeup of their eyes including: photoreceptors, opsins, lenses, and synapses. The comparison of these attributes to more derived visual systems can allow for a further understanding of how the evolution of more derived visual systems may have occurred, and puts into perspective how box jellyfish can play the role as an evolutionary/developmental model for all visual systems.

===== Characteristics =====
Box jellyfish visual systems are both diverse and complex, comprising multiple photosystems. There is likely considerable variation in visual properties between species of box jellyfish given the significant inter-species morphological and physiological variation. Eyes tend to differ in size and shape, along with number of receptors (including opsins), and physiology across species of box jellyfish.

Box jellyfish have a series of intricate lensed eyes that are similar to those of more derived multicellular organisms such as vertebrates. Their 24 eyes fit into four different morphological categories. These categories consist of two large, morphologically different medial eyes (a lower and upper lensed eye) containing spherical lenses, a lateral pair of pigment slit eyes, and a lateral pair of pigment pit eyes. The eyes are situated on rhopalia (small sensory structures) which serve sensory functions of the box jellyfish and arise from the cavities of the exumbrella (the surface of the body) on the side of the bells of the jellyfish. The two large eyes are located on the mid-line of the club and are considered complex because they contain lenses. The four remaining eyes lie laterally on either side of each rhopalia and are considered simple. The simple eyes are observed as small invaginated cups of epithelium that have developed pigmentation. The larger of the complex eyes contains a cellular cornea created by a mono ciliated epithelium, cellular lens, homogenous capsule to the lens, vitreous body with prismatic elements, and a retina of pigmented cells. The smaller of the complex eyes is said to be slightly less complex given that it lacks a capsule but otherwise contains the same structure as the larger eye.

Box jellyfish have multiple photosystems that comprise different sets of eyes. Evidence includes immunocytochemical and molecular data that show photopigment differences among the different morphological eye types, and physiological experiments done on box jellyfish to suggest behavioral differences among photosystems. Each individual eye type constitutes photosystems that work collectively to control visually guided behaviors.

Box jellyfish eyes primarily use c-PRCs (ciliary photoreceptor cells) similar to that of vertebrate eyes. These cells undergo phototransduction cascades (process of light absorption by photoreceptors) that are triggered by c-opsins. Available opsin sequences suggest that there are two types of opsins possessed by all cnidarians including an ancient phylogenetic opsin, and a sister ciliary opsin to the c-opsins group. Box jellyfish could have both ciliary and cnidops (cnidarian opsins), which is something not previously believed to appear in the same retina. Nevertheless, it is not entirely evident whether cnidarians possess multiple opsins that are capable of having distinctive spectral sensitivities.

===== Comparison with other organisms =====
Comparative research on genetic and molecular makeup of box jellyfishes&#x27; eyes versus more derived eyes seen in vertebrates and cephalopods focuses on: lenses and crystallin composition, synapses, and Pax genes and their implied evidence for shared primordial (ancestral) genes in eye evolution.

Box jellyfish eyes are said to be an evolutionary/developmental model of all eyes based on their evolutionary recruitment of crystallins and Pax genes. Research done on box jellyfish including &quot;Tripedalia cystophora&quot; has suggested that they possess a single Pax gene, PaxB. PaxB functions by binding to crystallin promoters and activating them. PaxB in situ hybridization resulted in PaxB expression in the lens, retina, and statocysts. These results and the rejection of the prior hypothesis that Pax6 was an ancestral Pax gene in eyes has led to the conclusion that PaxB was a primordial gene in eye evolution, and that the eyes of all organisms likely share a common ancestor.

The lens structure of box jellyfish appears very similar to those of other organisms, but the crystallins are distinct in both function and appearance. Weak reactions were seen within the sera and there were very weak sequence similarities within the crystallins among vertebrate and invertebrate lenses. This is likely due to differences in lower molecular weight proteins and the subsequent lack of immunological reactions with antisera that other organisms&#x27; lenses exhibit.

All four of the visual systems of box jellyfish species investigated with detail (&quot;Carybdea marsupialis, Chiropsalmus quadrumanus, Tamoya haplonema and Tripedalia cystophora&quot;) have invaginated synapses, but only in the upper and lower lensed eyes. Different densities were found between the upper and lower lenses, and between species. Four types of chemical synapses have been discovered within the rhopalia which could help in understanding neural organization including: clear unidirectional, dense-core unidirectional, clear bidirectional, and clear and dense-core bidirectional. The synapses of the lensed eyes could be useful as markers to learn more about the neural circuit in box jellyfish retinal areas.

==== Evolution as a response to natural stimuli ====
The primary adaptive responses to environmental variation observed in box jellyfish eyes include pupillary constriction speeds in response to light environments, as well as photoreceptor tuning and lens adaptations to better respond to shifts between light environments and darkness. Some box jellyfish species&#x27; eyes appear to have evolved more focused vision in response to their habitat.

Pupillary contraction appears to have evolved in response to variation in the light environment across ecological niches across three species of box jellyfish (&quot;Chironex fleckeri&quot;, &quot;Chiropsella bronzie&quot;, and &quot;Carukia barnesi&quot;). Behavioral studies suggest that faster pupil contraction rates allow for greater object avoidance, and in fact, species with more complex habitats exhibit faster rates. &quot;Ch. bronzie&quot; inhabit shallow beach fronts that have low visibility and very few obstacles, thus, faster pupil contraction in response to objects in their environment is not important. &quot;Ca. barnesi&quot; and &quot;Ch. fleckeri&quot; are found in more three-dimensionally complex environments like mangroves with an abundance of natural obstacles, where faster pupil contraction is more adaptive. Behavioral studies support the idea that faster pupillary contraction rates assist with obstacle avoidance as well as depth adjustments in response to differing light intensities.

Light/dark adaptation via pupillary light reflexes is an additional form of an evolutionary response to the light environment. This relates to the pupil&#x27;s response to shifts between light intensity (generally from sunlight to darkness). In the process of light/dark adaptation, the upper and lower lens eyes of different box jellyfish species vary in specific function. The lower lens-eyes contain pigmented photoreceptors and long pigment cells with dark pigments that migrate on light/dark adaptation, while the upper-lens eyes play a concentrated role in light direction and phototaxis given that they face upward towards the water surface (towards the sun or moon). The upper lens of &quot;Ch. bronzie&quot; does not exhibit any considerable optical power while &quot;Tr. cystophora&quot; (a box jellyfish species that tends to live in mangroves) does. The ability to use light to visually guide behavior is not of as much importance to &quot;Ch. bronzie&quot; as it is to species in more obstacle-filled environments. Differences in visually guided behavior serve as evidence that species that share the same number and structure of eyes can exhibit differences in how they control behavior.

== Largest and smallest ==
Jellyfish range from about one millimeter in bell height and diameter, to nearly in bell height and diameter; the tentacles and mouth parts usually extend beyond this bell dimension.

The smallest jellyfish are the peculiar creeping jellyfish in the genera &quot;Staurocladia&quot; and &quot;Eleutheria&quot;, which have bell disks from to a few millimeters in diameter, with short tentacles that extend out beyond this, which these jellyfish use to move across the surface of seaweed or the bottoms of rocky pools; many of these tiny creeping jellyfish cannot be seen in the field without a hand lens or microscope. They can reproduce asexually by fission (splitting in half). Other very small jellyfish, which have bells about one millimeter, are the hydromedusae of many species that have just been released from their parent polyps; some of these live only a few minutes before shedding their gametes in the plankton and then dying, while others will grow in the plankton for weeks or months. The hydromedusae &quot;Cladonema radiatum&quot; and &quot;Cladonema californicum&quot; are also very small, living for months, yet never growing beyond a few mm in bell height and diameter.

The lion&#x27;s mane jellyfish, &quot;Cyanea capillata&quot;, was long-cited as the largest jellyfish, and arguably the longest animal in the world, with fine, thread-like tentacles that may extend up to long (though most are nowhere near that large). They have a moderately painful, but rarely fatal, sting.
The increasingly common giant Nomura&#x27;s jellyfish, &quot;Nemopilema nomurai&quot;, found in some, but not all years in the waters of Japan, Korea and China in summer and autumn is another candidate for &quot;largest jellyfish&quot;, in terms of diameter and weight, since the largest Nomura&#x27;s jellyfish in late autumn can reach in bell (body) diameter and about in weight, with average specimens frequently reaching in bell diameter and about in weight. The large bell mass of the giant Nomura&#x27;s jellyfish can dwarf a diver and is nearly always much greater than the Lion&#x27;s Mane, whose bell diameter can reach .

The rarely encountered deep-sea jellyfish &quot;Stygiomedusa gigantea&quot; is another candidate for &quot;largest jellyfish&quot;, with its thick, massive bell up to wide, and four thick, &quot;strap-like&quot; oral arms extending up to in length, very different from the typical fine, threadlike tentacles that rim the umbrella of more-typical-looking jellyfish, including the Lion&#x27;s Mane.

&quot;Desmonema glaciale&quot;, which lives in the Antarctic region, can reach a very large size (several meters). Purple-striped jelly (&quot;Chrysaora colorata&quot;) can also be extremely long (up to 15 feet).

== Life history and behavior ==


=== Life cycle ===
Jellyfish have a complex life cycle which includes both sexual and asexual phases, with the medusa being the sexual stage in most instances. Sperm fertilize eggs, which develop into larval planulae, become polyps, bud into ephyrae and then transform into adult medusae. In some species certain stages may be skipped.

Upon reaching adult size, jellyfish spawn regularly if there is a sufficient supply of food. In most species, spawning is controlled by light, with all individuals spawning at about the same time of day; in many instances this is at dawn or dusk. Jellyfish are usually either male or female (with occasional hermaphrodites). In most cases, adults release sperm and eggs into the surrounding water, where the unprotected eggs are fertilized and develop into larvae. In a few species, the sperm swim into the female&#x27;s mouth, fertilizing the eggs within her body, where they remain during early development stages. In moon jellies, the eggs lodge in pits on the oral arms, which form a temporary brood chamber for the developing planula larvae.

The planula is a small larva covered with cilia. When sufficiently developed, it settles onto a firm surface and develops into a polyp. The polyp generally consists of a small stalk topped by a mouth that is ringed by upward-facing tentacles. The polyps resemble those of closely related anthozoans, such as sea anemones and corals. The jellyfish polyp may be sessile, living on the bottom of boat hulls or other substrates, or it may be free-floating or attached to tiny bits of free-living plankton or rarely, fish or other invertebrates. Polyps may be solitary or colonial. Most polyps are only millimetres in diameter and feed continuously. The polyp stage may last for years.

After an interval and stimulated by seasonal or hormonal changes, the polyp may begin reproducing asexually by budding and, in the Scyphozoa, is called a segmenting polyp, or a scyphistoma. Budding produces more scyphistomae and also ephyrae. Budding sites vary by species; from the tentacle bulbs, the manubrium (above the mouth), or the gonads of hydromedusae. In a process known as strobilation, the polyp&#x27;s tentacles are reabsorbed and the body starts to narrow, forming transverse constrictions, in several places near the upper extremity of the polyp. These deepen as the constriction sites migrate down the body, and separate segments known as ephyra detach. These are free-swimming precursors of the adult medusa stage, which is the life stage that is typically identified as a jellyfish.
The ephyrae, usually only a millimeter or two across initially, swim away from the polyp and grow. Limnomedusae polyps can asexually produce a creeping &quot;frustule&quot; larval form, which crawls away before developing into another polyp. A few species can produce new medusae by budding directly from the medusan stage. Some hydromedusae reproduce by fission.

=== Lifespan ===
Little is known of the life histories of many jellyfish as the places on the seabed where the benthic forms of those species live have not been found. However, an asexually reproducing strobila form can sometimes live for several years, producing new medusae (ephyra larvae) each year.

An unusual species, &quot;Turritopsis dohrnii&quot;, formerly classified as &quot;Turritopsis nutricula&quot;, might be effectively immortal because of its ability under certain circumstances to transform from medusa back to the polyp stage, thereby escaping the death that typically awaits medusae post-reproduction if they have not otherwise been eaten by some other organism. So far this reversal has been observed only in the laboratory.

=== Locomotion ===
Using the moon jelly &quot;Aurelia aurita&quot; as an example, jellyfish have been shown to be the most energy-efficient swimmers of all animals. They move through the water by radially expanding and contracting their bell-shaped bodies to push water behind them. They pause between the contraction and expansion phases to create two vortex rings. Muscles are used for the contraction of the body, which creates the first vortex and pushes the animal forward, but the mesoglea is so elastic that the expansion is powered exclusively by relaxing the bell, which releases the energy stored from the contraction. Meanwhile, the second vortex ring starts to spin faster, sucking water into the bell and pushing against the centre of the body, giving a secondary and &quot;free&quot; boost forward. The mechanism, called passive energy recapture, only works in relatively small jellyfish moving at low speeds, allowing the animal to travel 30 percent farther on each swimming cycle. Jellyfish achieved a 48 percent lower cost of transport (food and oxygen intake versus energy spent in movement) than other animals in similar studies. One reason for this is that most of the gelatinous tissue of the bell is inactive, using no energy during swimming.

== Ecology ==
=== Diet ===
Jellyfish are, like other cnidarians, generally carnivorous (or parasitic), feeding on planktonic organisms, crustaceans, small fish, fish eggs and larvae, and other jellyfish, ingesting food and voiding undigested waste through the mouth. They hunt passively using their tentacles as drift lines, or sink through the water with their tentacles spread widely; the tentacles, which contain nematocysts to stun or kill the prey, may then flex to help bring it to the mouth. Their swimming technique also helps them to capture prey; when their bell expands it sucks in water which brings more potential prey within reach of the tentacles.

A few species such as &quot;Aglaura hemistoma&quot; are omnivorous, feeding on microplankton which is a mixture of zooplankton and phytoplankton (microscopic plants) such as dinoflagellates. Others harbour mutualistic algae (Zooxanthellae) in their tissues; the spotted jellyfish (&quot;Mastigias papua&quot;) is typical of these, deriving part of its nutrition from the products of photosynthesis, and part from captured zooplankton. The upside-down jellyfish (&quot;Cassiopea andromeda&quot;) also has a symbiotic relationship with microalgae, but captures tiny animals to supplement their diet. This is done by releasing tiny balls of living cells composed of mesoglea. These use cilia to drive them through water and stinging cells which stun the prey. The blobs also seems to have digestive capabilities.

=== Predation ===
Other species of jellyfish are among the most common and important jellyfish predators. Sea anemones may eat jellyfish that drift into their range. Other predators include tunas, sharks, swordfish, sea turtles and penguins. Jellyfish washed up on the beach are consumed by foxes, other terrestrial mammals and birds. In general however, few animals prey on jellyfish; they can broadly be considered to be top predators in the food chain. Once jellyfish have become dominant in an ecosystem, for example through overfishing which removes predators of jellyfish larvae, there may be no obvious way for the previous balance to be restored: they eat fish eggs and juvenile fish, and compete with fish for food, preventing fish stocks from recovering.

=== Symbiosis ===
Some small fish are immune to the stings of the jellyfish and live among the tentacles, serving as bait in a fish trap; they are safe from potential predators and are able to share the fish caught by the jellyfish. The cannonball jellyfish has a symbiotic relationship with ten different species of fish, and with the longnose spider crab, which lives inside the bell, sharing the jellyfish&#x27;s food and nibbling its tissues.

=== Blooms ===


Jellyfish form large masses or blooms in certain environmental conditions of ocean currents, nutrients, sunshine, temperature, season, prey availability, reduced predation and oxygen concentration. Currents collect jellyfish together, especially in years with unusually high populations. Jellyfish can detect marine currents and swim against the current to congregate in blooms. Jellyfish are better able to survive in nutrient-rich, oxygen-poor water than competitors, and thus can feast on plankton without competition. Jellyfish may also benefit from saltier waters, as saltier waters contain more iodine, which is necessary for polyps to turn into jellyfish. Rising sea temperatures caused by climate change may also contribute to jellyfish blooms, because many species of jellyfish are able to survive in warmer waters. Increased nutrients from agricultural or urban runoff with nutrients including nitrogen and phosphorus compounds increase the growth of phytoplankton, causing eutrophication and algal blooms. When the phytoplankton die, they may create dead zones, so-called because they are hypoxic (low in oxygen). This in turn kills fish and other animals, but not jellyfish, allowing them to bloom. Jellyfish populations may be expanding globally as a result of land runoff and overfishing of their natural predators. Jellyfish are well placed to benefit from disturbance of marine ecosystems. They reproduce rapidly; they prey upon many species, while few species prey on them; and they feed via touch rather than visually, so they can feed effectively at night and in turbid waters. It may be difficult for fish stocks to re-establish themselves in marine ecosystems once they have become dominated by jellyfish, because jellyfish feed on plankton, which includes fish eggs and larvae.
As suspected at the turn of this century, jellyfish blooms are increasing in frequency. Between 2013 and 2020 the Mediterranean Science Commission monitored on a weekly basis the frequency of such outbreaks in coastal waters from Morocco to the Black Sea, revealing a relatively high frequency of these blooms nearly all year round, with peaks observed from March to July and often again in the autumn. The blooms are caused by different jellyfish species, depending on their localisation within the Basin: one observes a clear dominance of &quot;Pelagia noctiluca&quot; and &quot;Velella velella&quot; outbreaks in the western Mediterranean, of &quot;Rhizostoma pulmo&quot; and &quot;Rhopilema nomadica&quot; outbreaks in the eastern Mediterranean, and of &quot;Aurelia aurita&quot; and &quot;Mnemiopsis leidyi&quot; outbreaks in the Black Sea. 

Some jellyfish populations that have shown clear increases in the past few decades are invasive species, newly arrived from other habitats: examples include the Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Baltic Sea, central and eastern Mediterranean, Hawaii, and tropical and subtropical parts of the West Atlantic (including the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and Brazil).

Jellyfish blooms can have significant impact on community structure. Some carnivorous jellyfish species prey on zooplankton while others graze on primary producers. Reductions in zooplankton and ichthyoplankton due to a jellyfish bloom can ripple through the trophic levels. High-density jellyfish populations can outcompete other predators and reduce fish recruitment. Increased grazing on primary producers by jellyfish can also interrupt energy transfer to higher trophic levels.

During blooms, jellyfish significantly alter the nutrient availability in their environment. Blooms require large amounts of available organic nutrients in the water column to grow, limiting availability for other organisms. Some jellyfish have a symbiotic relationship with single-celled dinoflagellates, allowing them to assimilate inorganic carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen creating competition for phytoplankton. Their large biomass makes them an important source of dissolved and particulate organic matter for microbial communities through excretion, mucus production, and decomposition. The microbes break down the organic matter into inorganic ammonium and phosphate. However, the low carbon availability shifts the process from production to respiration creating low oxygen areas making the dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus largely unavailable for primary production.

These blooms have very real impacts on industries. Jellyfish can outcompete fish by utilizing open niches in over-fished fisheries. Catch of jellyfish can strain fishing gear and lead to expenses relating to damaged gear. Power plants have been shut down due to jellyfish blocking the flow of cooling water. Blooms have also been harmful for tourism, causing a rise in stings and sometimes the closure of beaches.

Jellyfish form a component of jelly-falls, events where gelatinous zooplankton fall to the seafloor, providing food for the benthic organisms there. In temperate and subpolar regions, jelly-falls usually follow immediately after a bloom.

=== Habitats ===
Most jellyfish are marine animals, although a few hydromedusae inhabit freshwater. The best known freshwater example is the cosmopolitan hydrozoan jellyfish, &quot;Craspedacusta sowerbii&quot;. It is less than an inch (2.5 cm) in diameter, colorless and does not sting. Some jellyfish populations have become restricted to coastal saltwater lakes, such as Jellyfish Lake in Palau. Jellyfish Lake is a marine lake where millions of golden jellyfish (&quot;Mastigias&quot; spp.) migrate horizontally across the lake daily.

Although most jellyfish live well off the ocean floor and form part of the plankton, a few species are closely associated with the bottom for much of their lives and can be considered benthic. The upside-down jellyfish in the genus &quot;Cassiopea&quot; typically lie on the bottom of shallow lagoons where they sometimes pulsate gently with their umbrella top facing down. Even some deep-sea species of hydromedusae and scyphomedusae are usually collected on or near the bottom. All of the stauromedusae are found attached to either seaweed or rocky or other firm material on the bottom.

Some species explicitly adapt to tidal flux. In Roscoe Bay, jellyfish ride the current at ebb tide until they hit a gravel bar, and then descend below the current. They remain in still waters until the tide rises, ascending and allowing it to sweep them back into the bay. They also actively avoid fresh water from mountain snowmelt, diving until they find enough salt.

=== Parasites ===
Jellyfish are hosts to a wide variety of parasitic organisms. They act as intermediate hosts of endoparasitic helminths, with the infection being transferred to the definitive host fish after predation. Some digenean trematodes, especially species in the family Lepocreadiidae, use jellyfish as their second intermediate hosts. Fish become infected by the trematodes when they feed on infected jellyfish.

== Relation to humans ==
=== Fisheries ===
Jellyfish have long been eaten in some parts of the world. Fisheries have begun harvesting the American cannonball jellyfish, &quot;Stomolophus meleagris&quot;, along the southern Atlantic coast of the United States and in the Gulf of Mexico for export to Asia.

Jellyfish are also harvested for their collagen, which is being investigated for use in a variety of applications including the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

Aquaculture and fisheries of other species often suffer severe losses – and so losses of productivity – due to jellyfish.

=== Products ===
Aristotle stated in the &quot;Parts of Animals&quot; IV, 6 that jellyfish (sea-nettles) were eaten in wintertime in a fish stew.

In some countries, including China, Japan, and Korea, jellyfish are a delicacy. The jellyfish is dried to prevent spoiling.
Only some 12 species of scyphozoan jellyfish belonging to the order Rhizostomeae are harvested for food, mostly in southeast Asia. Rhizostomes, especially &quot;Rhopilema esculentum&quot; in China ( &quot;hǎizhé&quot;, &#x27;sea stingers&#x27;) and &quot;Stomolophus meleagris&quot; (cannonball jellyfish) in the United States, are favored because of their larger and more rigid bodies and because their toxins are harmless to humans.

Traditional processing methods, carried out by a jellyfish master, involve a 20- to 40-day multi-phase procedure in which, after removing the gonads and mucous membranes, the umbrella and oral arms are treated with a mixture of table salt and alum, and compressed. Processing makes the jellyfish drier and more acidic, producing a crisp texture. Jellyfish prepared this way retain 7–10% of their original weight, and the processed product consists of approximately 94% water and 6% protein. Freshly processed jellyfish has a white, creamy color and turns yellow or brown during prolonged storage.

In China, processed jellyfish are desalted by soaking in water overnight and eaten cooked or raw. The dish is often served shredded with a dressing of oil, soy sauce, vinegar and sugar, or as a salad with vegetables. In Japan, cured jellyfish are rinsed, cut into strips and served with vinegar as an appetizer. Desalted, ready-to-eat products are also available.

=== Biotechnology ===

Pliny the Elder reported in his &quot;Natural History&quot; that the slime of the jellyfish &quot;&quot; produced light when rubbed on a walking stick.

In 1961, Osamu Shimomura extracted green fluorescent protein (GFP) and another bioluminescent protein, called aequorin, from the large and abundant hydromedusa &quot;Aequorea victoria&quot;, while studying photoproteins that cause bioluminescence in this species. Three decades later, Douglas Prasher sequenced and cloned the gene for GFP. Martin Chalfie figured out how to use GFP as a fluorescent marker of genes inserted into other cells or organisms. Roger Tsien later chemically manipulated GFP to produce other fluorescent colors to use as markers. In 2008, Shimomura, Chalfie and Tsien won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work with GFP.
Man-made GFP became widely used as a fluorescent tag to show which cells or tissues express specific genes. The genetic engineering technique fuses the gene of interest to the GFP gene. The fused DNA is then put into a cell, to generate either a cell line or (via IVF techniques) an entire animal bearing the gene. In the cell or animal, the artificial gene turns on in the same tissues and the same time as the normal gene, making a fusion of the normal protein with GFP attached to the end, illuminating the animal or cell reveals what tissues express that protein—or at what stage of development. The fluorescence shows where the gene is expressed.

=== Aquarium display ===

Jellyfish are displayed in many public aquariums. Often the tank&#x27;s background is blue and the animals are illuminated by side light, increasing the contrast between the animal and the background. In natural conditions, many jellies are so transparent that they are nearly invisible. Jellyfish are not adapted to closed spaces. They depend on currents to transport them from place to place. Professional exhibits as in the Monterey Bay Aquarium feature precise water flows, typically in circular tanks to avoid trapping specimens in corners. The outflow is spread out over a large surface area and the inflow enters as a sheet of water in front of the outflow, so the jellyfish do not get sucked into it. As of 2009, jellyfish were becoming popular in home aquariums, where they require similar equipment.

=== Stings ===
Jellyfish are armed with nematocysts, a type of specialized stinging cell. Contact with a jellyfish tentacle can trigger millions of nematocysts to pierce the skin and inject venom, but only some species&#x27; venom causes an adverse reaction in humans. In a study published in Communications Biology, researchers found a jellyfish species called &quot;Cassiopea xamachana&quot; which when triggered will release tiny balls of cells that swim around the jellyfish stinging everything in their path. Researchers described these as &quot;self-propelling microscopic grenades&quot; and named them cassiosomes.

The effects of stings range from mild discomfort to extreme pain and death. Most jellyfish stings are not deadly, but stings of some box jellyfish (Irukandji jellyfish), such as the sea wasp, can be deadly. Stings may cause anaphylaxis (a form of shock), which can be fatal. Jellyfish kill 20 to 40 people a year in the Philippines alone. In 2006 the Spanish Red Cross treated 19,000 stung swimmers along the Costa Brava.

Vinegar (3–10% aqueous acetic acid) may help with box jellyfish stings but not the stings of the Portuguese man o&#x27; war. Clearing the area of jelly and tentacles reduces nematocyst firing. Scraping the affected skin, such as with the edge of a credit card, may remove remaining nematocysts. Once the skin has been cleaned of nematocysts, hydrocortisone cream applied locally reduces pain and inflammation. Antihistamines may help to control itching. Immunobased antivenins are used for serious box jellyfish stings.

In Elba Island and Corsica dittrichia viscosa is now used by residents and tourists to heal stings from jellyfish, bees and wasps by pressing fresh leaves on the skin with quick results.

=== Mechanical issues ===
Jellyfish in large quantities can fill and split fishing nets and crush captured fish. They can clog cooling equipment, having disabled power stations in several countries; jellyfish caused a cascading blackout in the Philippines in 1999, as well as damaging the Diablo Canyon Power Plant in California in 2008. They can also stop desalination plants and ships&#x27; engines.

<text>Mantua ( ; ; Lombard and ) is a &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) in the Italian region of Lombardy, and capital of the province of the same name.

In 2016, Mantua was designated as the &quot;Italian Capital of Culture&quot;. In 2017, it was named as the &quot;European Capital of Gastronomy&quot;, included in the Eastern Lombardy District (together with the cities of Bergamo, Brescia, and Cremona).

In 2008, Mantua&#x27;s &quot;centro storico&quot; (old town) and the nearby of Sabbioneta were declared by UNESCO to be a World Heritage Site. Mantua&#x27;s historic power and influence under the Gonzaga family between 1328 and 1708 made it one of the main artistic, cultural, and especially musical hubs of Northern Italy and of Italy as a whole. It had one of the most splendid courts of Europe of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and early seventeenth centuries. Mantua is noted for its significant role in the history of opera; the city is also known for its architectural treasures and artifacts, elegant palaces, and the medieval and Renaissance cityscape. It is the city where the composer Monteverdi premiered his 1607 opera &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; and to where Romeo was banished in Shakespeare&#x27;s 1597 play &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. It is the nearest town to the birthplace of the Roman classical poet Virgil, who is commemorated by a statue at the lakeside park &quot;Piazza Virgiliana&quot;.

Mantua is surrounded on three sides by artificial lakes, created during the 12th century as the city&#x27;s defence system. These lakes receive water from the River Mincio, a tributary of the River Po, which descends from Lake Garda. The three lakes are called &quot;Lago Superiore&quot;, &quot;Lago di Mezzo&quot;, and &quot;Lago Inferiore&quot; (&quot;Upper&quot;, &quot;Middle&quot;, and &quot;Lower&quot; Lakes, respectively). A fourth lake, Lake Pajolo, which once served as a defensive water ring around the city, dried up at the end of the 18th century.

The area and its environs are important not only in naturalistic terms, but also anthropologically and historically; research has highlighted a number of human settlements scattered between Barche di Solferino and Bande di Cavriana, Castellaro, and Isolone del Mincio. These dated, without interruption, from Neolithic times (5th–4th millennium BC) to the Bronze Age (2nd–1st millennium BC) and the Gallic phases (2nd–1st centuries BC), and ended with Roman residential settlements, which can be traced to the 3rd century AD.

In 2017, Legambiente ranked Mantua as the best Italian city for quality of life and environment.

== Geography ==
Mantua lies in the east of the region of Lombardy, halfway between Milan and Venice, on the River Mincio. It is south of Verona, east of Cremona, north-east of Parma, northwest of Ferrara, and west-southwest of Padua.

==History==

Mantua was an island settlement which was first established about the year 2000 BC on the banks of River Mincio, which flows from Lake Garda to the Adriatic Sea. In the 6th century BC, Mantua was an Etruscan village which, in the Etruscan tradition, was re-founded by Ocnus.

The name may derive from the Etruscan god Mantus. After being conquered by the Cenomani, a Gallic tribe, Mantua was subsequently fought between the first and second Punic wars against the Romans, who attributed its name to Manto, a daughter of Tiresias. This territory was later populated by veteran soldiers of Augustus. Mantua&#x27;s most famous ancient citizen is the poet Virgil, or Publius Vergilius Maro (&quot;Mantua me genuit&quot;), who was born in the year 70 BC at a village near the city which is now known as Virgilio.

===After the Fall of the Roman Empire===
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire at the hands of Odoacer in 476 AD, Mantua was, along with the rest of Italy, conquered by the Ostrogoths. It was retaken by the Eastern Roman Empire in the middle of the 6th century following the Gothic war but was subsequently lost again to the Lombards. They were in turn conquered by Charlemagne in 774, thus incorporating Mantua into the Frankish Empire. Partitions of the empire (due to the Franks&#x27; use of partible inheritance) in the Treaties of Verdun and Prüm led to Mantua passing to Middle Francia in 843, then the Kingdom of Italy in 855. In 962 Italy was invaded by King Otto I of Germany, and Mantua thus became a vassal of the newly formed Holy Roman Empire.

In the 11th century, Mantua became a possession of Boniface of Canossa, marquis of Tuscany. The last ruler of that family was the countess Matilda of Canossa (d. 1115), who, according to legend, ordered the construction of the precious Rotonda di San Lorenzo (or St. Lawrence&#x27;s Roundchurch) in 1082. The Rotonda still exists today and was renovated in 2013.

==== Free Imperial City of Mantua ====
After the death of Matilda of Canossa, Mantua became a free commune and strenuously defended itself from the influence of the Holy Roman Empire during the 12th and 13th centuries. In 1198, Alberto Pitentino altered the course of River Mincio, creating what the Mantuans call &quot;the four lakes&quot; to reinforce the city&#x27;s natural protection. Three of these lakes still remain today and the fourth one, which ran through the centre of town, was reclaimed during the 18th century.

====Podesteria Rule====
From 1215, the city was ruled under the &quot;podesteria&quot; of the Guelph poet-statesman Rambertino Buvalelli.

During the struggle between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, Pinamonte Bonacolsi took advantage of the chaotic situation to seize power of the podesteria in 1273. He was declared the &quot;Captain General of the People&quot;. The Bonacolsi family ruled Mantua for the next two generations and made it more prosperous and artistically beautiful. On 16 August 1328 Luigi Gonzaga, an official in Bonacolsi&#x27;s podesteria, and his family staged a public revolt in Mantua and forced a coup d&#x27;état on the last Bonacolsi ruler, Rinaldo.

===House of Gonzaga===
Ludovico Gonzaga, who had been Podestà of Mantua since 1318, was duly elected Capitano del popolo. The Gonzagas built new walls with five gates and renovated the city in the 14th century; however, the political situation did not settle until the governance of the third ruler of Gonzaga, Ludovico III Gonzaga, who eliminated his relatives and centralised power to himself. During the Italian Renaissance, the Gonzaga family softened their despotic rule and further raised the level of culture and refinement in Mantua. Mantua became a significant center of Renaissance art and humanism. Marquis Gianfrancesco Gonzaga had brought Vittorino da Feltre to Mantua in 1423 to open his famous humanist school, the Casa Giocosa.

Isabella d&#x27;Este, Marchioness of Mantua, married Francesco II Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua in 1490. When she moved to Mantua from Ferrara (she was the daughter of Duke Ercole the ruler of Ferrara) she created her famous studiolo firstly in Castello di San Giorgio for which she commissioned paintings from Mantegna, Perugino and Lorenzo Costa. She later moved her studiolo to the Corte Vecchia and commissioned two paintings from Correggio to join the five from Castello di San Giorgio. It was unusual for a woman to have a studiolo in 15th century Italy given they were regarded as masculine spaces. Isabella was a vociferous collector and such was her reputation that Niccolò da Corregio called her &#x27;la prima donna del mondo&#x27;.

Through a payment of 120,000 golden florins in 1433, Gianfrancesco I was appointed Marquis of Mantua by the Emperor Sigismund, whose niece Barbara of Brandenburg married his son, Ludovico. In 1459, Pope Pius II held the Council of Mantua to proclaim a crusade against the Turks. Under Ludovico and his heirs, the famous Renaissance painter Andrea Mantegna worked in Mantua as court painter, producing some of his most outstanding works.

====Duchy of Mantua====
The first Duke of Mantua was Federico II Gonzaga, who acquired the title from the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in 1530. Federico commissioned Giulio Romano to build the famous Palazzo Te, on the periphery of the city, and profoundly improved the city. In the late 16th century, Claudio Monteverdi came to Mantua from his native Cremona. He worked for the court of Vincenzo I Gonzaga, first as a singer and violist, then as music director, marrying the court singer Claudia Cattaneo in 1599.

===From Gonzaga to Habsburg===

In 1627, the direct line of the Gonzaga family came to an end with the vicious and weak Vincenzo II, and Mantua slowly declined under the new rulers, the Gonzaga-Nevers, a cadet French branch of the family. The War of the Mantuan Succession broke out, and in 1630 an Imperial army of 36,000 mercenaries under Matthias Gallas and Johann von Aldringen besieged and sacked Mantua, bringing the plague with them. Ferdinand Carlo IV, an inept ruler, whose only interest was in holding parties and theatrical shows, allied with France in the War of the Spanish Succession. After the French defeat, he took refuge in Venice and carried with him a thousand pictures. At his death in 1708, the Duke of Mantua was declared deposed and his family of Gonzaga lost Mantua forever in favour of the Habsburgs of Austria.

Under Austrian rule, Mantua enjoyed a revival and during this period the Royal Academy of Sciences, Letters and Arts, the Scientific Theatre, and numerous palaces were built.

====Napoleonic Wars====

In 1786, ten years before Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s campaign in Italy, the Austrian Duchy of Mantua briefly united with the Duchy of Milan until 1791.

On 4 June 1796 during the War of the First Coalition, Mantua was besieged by Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s French army. The first Austrian attempt to break the siege was successful and the siege was abandoned on 1 August. The Austrian army was defeated at the Battle of Castiglione on 5 August and left the area. The French resumed the siege on August 27 and accepted surrender of the city on 2 February 1797. The city was recaptured by the Austrians in the War of the Second Coalition after a siege lasting from 8 April to 28 July 1799.

Later, the city again passed into Napoleon&#x27;s control and became a part of Napoleon&#x27;s Kingdom of Italy. In 1810 Andreas Hofer was shot by Porta Giulia, a gate of the town at Borgo di Porto (Cittadella) for leading the insurrection in the County of Tyrol against Napoleon.

====Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia====

After the brief period of French rule, Mantua returned to Austria in 1814, becoming one of the Quadrilatero fortress cities in northern Italy. Under the Congress of Vienna (1815), Mantua became a province in the Austrian Empire&#x27;s Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia. Agitation against Austria, however, culminated in a revolt which lasted from 1851 to 1855, but it was finally suppressed by the Austrian army. One of the most famous episodes of the Italian Risorgimento took place in the valley of the Belfiore, where a group of rebels was hanged by the Austrians.

===Unification of Italy===

At the Battle of Solferino (Second Italian War of Independence) in 1859, the House of Savoy&#x27;s Piedmont-Sardinia sided with the French Emperor Napoleon III against the Austrian Empire. Following Austria&#x27;s defeat, Lombardy was ceded to France, who transferred Lombardy to Piedmont-Sardinia in return for Nice and Savoy.
Mantua, although a constituent province of Lombardy, still remained under the Austrian Empire along with Venetia. In 1866, Prussia-led North German Confederation sided with the newly established, Piedmont-led Kingdom of Italy against the Austrian Empire in the Third Italian War of Independence. The quick defeat of Austria led to its withdrawal of the Kingdom of Venetia (including the capital city, Venice). Mantua reconnected with the region of Lombardy and was incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy.

===20th century===
During World War II, in November 1943, Nazi Germany relocated the Stalag 337 prisoner-of-war camp from Leśna in German-occupied Poland to Mantua. The camp was dissolved in February 1944, and in April 1944 the Dulag 339 transit camp for British, Italian, American, French, Greek and Yugoslav POWs was established in its place, and remained operational until April 1945.

==Monuments and sites of interest==

The Gonzagas protected the arts and culture, and were hosts to several important artists such as Leone Battista Alberti, Andrea Mantegna, Giulio Romano, Donatello, Peter Paul Rubens, Pisanello, Domenico Fetti, Luca Fancelli and Nicolò Sebregondi. Though many of the masterworks have been dispersed, the cultural value of Mantua is nonetheless outstanding, with many of Mantua&#x27;s patrician and ecclesiastical buildings being uniquely important examples of Italian architecture.

A medieval building with portico and 15th-century loggia in Mantua is said to be &quot;Rigoletto&#x27;s house&quot;. It was actually the house of the cathedral regulars. It was chosen by the Gonzaga family as the residence of the legendary fool who was then used by Verdi in his opera.
* Netflix&#x27;s Italian mini-series The Trial (), released in Italy in 2019, was primarily filmed in Mantua. It was directed by Stefano Lodovichi, and was created by Alessandro Fabbri, in collaboration with Laura Colella and Enrico Audenino. It is the fictional story of the challenges faced by a local prosecutor as she takes up a murder case involving a local wealthy woman.

<text>The town drunk (also called a tavern fool) is a stock character in Anglo-Saxon culture, almost always male, who is drunk more often than exhibiting sobriety.

The town drunk is frequently depicted in a humorous light, often portrayed as a harmless and lovable character whose social failings stem from their excessive consumption of alcohol. However, some portrayals can be more nuanced, exploring the social and personal costs associated with alcoholism.

==Uses in fiction==
In fiction, the town drunk character serves a number of functions.

The town drunk may serve merely as a moral example and object lesson on the evils of drunkenness. This approach to the character is associated with the temperance movement, and peaked at the start of the twentieth century. The Prohibition film &quot;Ten Nights in a Barroom&quot; portrays the inevitable fall into destitute drunkenness of a person who dared to take that &quot;Fatal Glass of Beer&quot;, the title of another period drama working this vein. A town drunk appears in &quot;Our Town&quot; by Thornton Wilder. Pap Finn in &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; is another example. In modern fiction, which tends to reflect the contemporary influences of the sobriety movement, the town drunk may get sober and set about revitalizing his life.

The town drunk may play the role of the fool as a source of comic relief. &quot;Otis&quot; from &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; is this type of town drunk, as is the character of Bobby Singer in The CW series &quot;Supernatural,&quot; as well as many of the denizens of Moe&#x27;s Tavern from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; such as Barney Gumble. In 1971&#x27;s &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; the only adult survivor is a Town Drunk. In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, the Porter who appears in Act II, Scene 3, is also a type of &quot;comic relief&quot; drunk who serves to temporarily lighten the mood of the play right after a heinous regicide has taken place.

The town drunk may disrupt public meetings, either for comic effect, or by dispensing what proves to be wisdom in a garbled and comic form. Or, in this incarnation, the character may introduce the hero to some of the worldlier sorts of wisdom, as well as forming a contrast to his truly heroic character. One prototype for this version of the town drunk is supplied by Shakespeare&#x27;s Falstaff, who appears in both parts of &quot;Henry IV&quot; and in &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;. Another would be the drunk who appears in &quot;Team America: World Police&quot; at the low point of the film, where his drunken ramblings inspire the hero to save the world. In the 1722 Danish play &quot;Jeppe on the Hill&quot;, the eponymous wise fool main character, declares that &quot;everybody says that Jeppe drinks, but nobody asks why Jeppe drinks&quot;

<doc id="50190" wikidata="Q213460" url="?curid=50190" title="Pizzicato">
<text>Pizzicato (, ; translated as &#x27;pinched&#x27;, and sometimes roughly as &#x27;plucked&#x27;) is a playing technique that involves plucking the strings of a string instrument. The exact technique varies somewhat depending on the type of instrument:

* On bowed string instruments it is a method of playing by plucking the strings with the fingers, rather than using the bow. This produces a very different sound from bowing, short and percussive rather than sustained.
* On keyboard string instruments, such as the piano, pizzicato may be employed (although rarely seen in traditional repertoire, this technique has been normalized in contemporary music, with ample examples by George Crumb, Toru Takemitsu, Helmut Lachenmann, and others) as one of the variety of techniques involving direct manipulation of the strings known collectively as &quot;string piano&quot;.
* On the guitar, it is a muted form of plucking, which bears an audible resemblance to pizzicato on a bowed string instrument with its relatively shorter sustain. It is also known (especially in non-classical guitar) as palm muting.

When a string is struck or plucked, including pizzicato, sound waves are generated that do not belong to a harmonic series as when a string is bowed. This complex timbre is called inharmonicity. The inharmonicity of a string depends on its physical characteristics, such as tension, composition, diameter and length. The inharmonicity disappears when strings are bowed because the bow&#x27;s stick-slip action is periodic, so it drives all of the resonances of the string at exactly harmonic ratios, even if it has to drive them slightly off their natural frequency.

==History==
The first recognised use of pizzicato in classical music is found in Tobias Hume&#x27;s &quot;Captain Humes Poeticall Musicke&quot; (1607), wherein he instructs the viola da gamba player to use pizzicato (&quot;). Another early use is found in Claudio Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda&quot; (around 1638), in which the players are instructed to use two fingers of their right hand to pluck the strings. Later, in 1756, Leopold Mozart in his &quot;Versuch einer gründlichen Violinschule&quot; instructs the player to use the index finger of the right hand. This has remained the most usual way to execute a pizzicato, though sometimes the middle finger is used. The bow is held in the hand at the same time unless there is enough time to put it down and pick it up again between bowed passages.

===Uses in various styles of music===
In jazz and bluegrass, and the few popular music styles which use double bass (such as French modern chanson, American psychobilly and rockabilly), pizzicato is the usual way to play the double bass. This is unusual for a violin-family instrument, because regardless whether violin-family instruments are being used in jazz (e.g., jazz violin), popular, traditional (e.g., Bluegrass fiddle) or Classical music, they are usually played with the bow for most of a performance. In classical double bass playing, pizzicato is often performed with the bow held in the hand; as such, the string is usually only plucked with a single finger. In contrast, in jazz, bluegrass, and other non-Classical styles, the player is not usually holding a bow and is therefore free to use two or three fingers to pluck the string.

In classical music, however, string instruments are most usually played with the bow, and composers give specific indications to play pizzicato where required. Pieces in classical music that are played entirely pizzicato include:
* J. S. Bach: the ninth movement of the &quot;Magnificat&quot; (1723–1733)
* Johann Strauss II and Josef Strauss: &quot;Pizzicato Polka&quot; (1869)
* Edvard Grieg: Act IV – Anitra&#x27;s Dance in &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; (1874)
* Léo Delibes: the &quot;Divertissement: Pizzicati&quot; from Act 3 of the ballet &quot;Sylvia&quot; (1876)
* Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky: the third movement of the 4th symphony (1877–78)
* Johann Strauss II: &quot;Neue Pizzicato Polka&quot; (1892)
* Helmer Alexandersson: the third movement of his second symphony (1919)
* Béla Bartók: the fourth movement of the &quot;String Quartet No. 4&quot; (1928)
* Benjamin Britten: the second movement of the &quot;Simple Symphony&quot; (1934)
* Leroy Anderson: &quot;Jazz Pizzicato&quot; (1938) and &quot;Plink, Plank, Plunk!&quot; (1951)

Antonio Vivaldi, in the &quot;Ah Ch&#x27;Infelice Sempre&quot; section of his cantata &quot;Cessate, omai cessate&quot;, combined both pizzicato and bowed instruments to create a unique sound. He also included pizzicato in the second movement of &quot;Winter&quot; from &quot;The Four Seasons&quot;.

==Notation==
In music notation, a composer will normally indicate the performer should use pizzicato with the abbreviation &quot;pizz.&quot; A return to bowing is indicated by the Italian term &quot;arco&quot; or &quot;bog&quot;. A left hand pizzicato is usually indicated by writing a small cross above the note, and a Bartók pizzicato is often indicated by a circle with a small vertical line through the top of it above the note in question or by writing &quot;Bartók pizz&quot; at the start of the relevant passage. 

In classical music, arco playing is the default assumption; thus, if a music notation part starts and no indication is given as to whether the notes are arco or pizz, the player assumes that the notes are bowed.

==Bowed string instrument technique==

===Practical implications===
If a string player has to play pizzicato for a long period of time, the performer may put down the bow. Violinists and violists may also hold the instrument in the &quot;banjo position&quot; (resting horizontally on the lap), and pluck the strings with the thumb of the right hand. This technique is rarely used, and usually only in movements which are pizzicato throughout. A technique similar to this, where the strings are actually strummed like a guitar, is called for in the 4th movement of Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Capriccio Espagnol&quot; (Scena e canto gitano), where the violins, violas, and cellos are instructed to play pizzicato &quot;quasi guitara&quot;, the music here consists of three and four-note chords, which are fingered and strummed much like the instrument being imitated.

===Other pizzicato techniques===

Another colorful pizzicato technique used in the Rimsky-Korsakov piece mentioned above is two-handed pizzicato, indicated by the markings &quot;m.s.&quot; and &quot;m.d.&quot; (for &quot;mano sinistra&quot;, &#x27;left hand&#x27;, and &quot;mano destra&quot;, &#x27;right hand&#x27;); here, the open E string is plucked alternately in rapid succession by the left and right hands.

One can also use the left hand fingers for pizzicato, either when they are not in use or as they are leaving their previous position. This allows pizzicati in places where there would not normally be time to bring the right hand from or to the bowing position. Use of left-hand pizzicato is relatively uncommon and is most often found in the violin solo repertoire; two famous examples of left-hand pizzicato are Paganini&#x27;s 24th Caprice and Sarasate&#x27;s Zigeunerweisen. Left hand pizzicato can also be used while bowed notes are being held, an effect appearing primarily in repertoire of the late 19th century and beyond. Examples of this technique can be found in the works of Wieniawski, Berg (&quot;Violin Concerto&quot;), Stravinsky (&quot;Three Pieces for String Quartet&quot;) and many others. 

Maurice Delage calls for slurred pizzicati in the cello part of his &quot;Quatre poèmes hindous&quot; for soprano and chamber orchestra. This is achieved by playing one note, and then stopping a new note on the same string without plucking the string again. This technique (known as &quot;hammering-on&quot; on guitar) is rarely used on bowed instruments.

A further variation is a particularly strong pizzicato where the string is plucked vertically by snapping and rebounds off the fingerboard of the instrument. This is known as &quot;snap pizzicato&quot; or &quot;Bartók pizzicato&quot;, after one of the first composers to use it extensively (e.g. in the 4th movement of his Fourth String Quartet, 1928). Gustav Mahler famously employs this kind of pizzicato in the third movement of his Seventh Symphony, in which he provides the cellos and double basses with the footnote &quot;pluck so hard that the strings hit the wood&quot; in bar 401.

On the double bass, this style of snap pizzicato, or &quot;slapping&quot;, was used in jazz since the 1920s and later used in rockabilly. Because an unamplified double bass is generally the quietest instrument in a jazz band, many players of the 1920s and 1930s used the slap style, slapping and pulling the strings so that they make a rhythmic &quot;slap&quot; sound against the fingerboard. The slap style cuts through the sound of a band better than simply plucking the strings, and allowed the bass to be more easily heard on early sound recordings, as the recording equipment of that time did not favor low frequencies.

Bartók also made use of pizzicato glissandi, executed by plucking a note and then sliding the stopping finger up or down the string. This technique can be heard in his &quot;Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta&quot;.

Roman Kim made pizzicatos using his mouth.

<doc id="50203" wikidata="Q93128" url="?curid=50203" title="William Harvey">
<text>William Harvey (1 April 1578 – 3 June 1657) was an English physician who made influential contributions to anatomy and physiology. He was the first known physician to describe completely, and in detail, pulmonary and systemic circulation as well as the specific process of blood being pumped to the brain and the rest of the body by the heart (though earlier writers, such as Realdo Colombo, Michael Servetus, and Jacques Dubois, had provided precursors to some of his theories).

== Family ==
William&#x27;s father, Thomas Harvey, was a jurat of Folkestone where he served as mayor in 1600. Records and personal descriptions delineate him as an overall calm, diligent, and intelligent man whose sons “... revered, consulted and implicitly trusted in him...” (they) made their father the treasurer of their wealth when they acquired great estates...(He) kept, employed, and improved their gainings to their great advantage.&quot; Thomas Harvey&#x27;s portrait can still be seen in the central panel of a wall of the dining room at Rolls Park, Chigwell, in Essex. William was the eldest of nine children, seven sons and two daughters, of Thomas and his wife Joan Halke.

Notable family connections include Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham, who married William&#x27;s niece Elizabeth Harvey, and the diplomat Sir Daniel Harvey. His great nephew was the naval hero Eliab Harvey, captain of HMS &quot;Temeraire&quot;.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and the University of Padua ===
Harvey&#x27;s initial education was carried out in Folkestone, where he learned Latin. He then entered the King&#x27;s School (Canterbury). Harvey stayed at the King&#x27;s School for five years, after which he matriculated at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge in 1593.

Harvey graduated as a Bachelor of Arts from Caius in 1597. He then travelled through France and Germany to Italy, where he entered the University of Padua, in 1599.

During Harvey&#x27;s years of study there, he developed a relationship with Fabricius and read Fabricius&#x27;s &quot;De Venarum Ostiolis&quot;.

Harvey graduated as a Doctor of Medicine at the age of 24 from the University of Padua on 25 April 1602. Harvey had

conducted himself so wonderfully well in the examination and had shown such skill, memory and learning that he had far surpassed even the great hopes which his examiners had formed of him.

=== The College of Physicians, marriage and Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital ===
After graduating from Padua, Harvey immediately returned to England, where he obtained the degree of Doctor of Medicine from the University of Cambridge that same year, and became a fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. Following this, Harvey established himself in London, joining the Royal College of Physicians on 5 October 1604.

A few weeks after his admission, Harvey married Elizabeth Browne, &quot;daughter of Lancelot Browne Dr. Physic&quot; (a medical doctor). They had no children.

Harvey was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 5 June 1607, which earned him the Post-nominal letters FRCP. He then accepted a position at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital that he was to occupy for almost all the rest of his life. Succeeding Dr Wilkinson on 14 October 1609, he became the Physician in charge at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, which enjoined him, &quot;in God&#x27;s most holy name&quot; to &quot;endeavor yourself to do the best of your knowledge in the profession of physic to the poor then present, or any other of the poor at any time of the week which shall be sent home unto you by the Hospitaller... You shall not, for favor, lucre or gain, appoint or write anything for the poor but such good and wholesome things as you shall think with your best advice will do the poor good, without any affection or respect to be had to the apothecary. And you shall take no gift or reward... for your counsel... This you will promise to do as you shall answer before God... &quot;

Harvey earned around thirty-three pounds a year and lived in a small house in Ludgate, although two houses in West Smithfield were attached as fringe benefits to the post of Physician. At this point, the physician&#x27;s function consisted of a simple but thorough analysis of patients who were brought to the hospital once a week and the subsequent writing of prescriptions.

=== Lumleian lecturer ===

The next important phase of Harvey&#x27;s life began with his appointment to the office of Lumleian lecturer on 4 August 1615. The Lumleian lectureship, founded by Lord Lumley and Dr. Richard Caldwell in 1582, consisted in giving lectures for a period of seven years, with the purpose of &quot;spreading light&quot; and increasing the general knowledge of anatomy throughout England.

Harvey began his lectures in April 1616, and also compiled his lecture notes in a notebook. At this time, at the age of thirty-seven, he was described as &quot;a man of lowest stature, round faced; his eyes small, round, very black and full of spirit; his hair as black as a raven and curling&quot;. The notes which he used at the time are preserved in the British Museum.

At the beginning of his lectures, Harvey laid down the canons for his guidance:

#&quot;To show as much as may be at a glance, the whole belly for instance, and afterwards to subdivide the parts according to their positions and relations.
#To point out what is peculiar to the actual body which is being dissected.
#To supply only by speech what cannot be shown on your own credit and by authority.
#To cut up as much as may be in the sight of the audience.
#To enforce the right opinion by remarks drawn far and near, and to illustrate man by the structure of animals.
#Not to praise or dispraise other anatomists, for all did well, and there was some excuse even for those who are in error.
#Not to dispute with others, or attempt to confute them, except by the most obvious retort.
#To state things briefly and plainly, yet not letting anything pass unmentioned which can be seen.
#Not to speak of anything which can be as well explained without the body or can be read at home.
#Not to enter into too much detail, or in too minute dissection, for the time does not permit.

=== Physician to James I ===
Harvey continued to participate in the Lumleian lectures while also taking care of his patients at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital; he thus soon attained an important and fairly lucrative practice, which climaxed with his appointment as &#x27;Physician Extraordinary&#x27; to King James I on 3 February 1618. He seems to have similarly served various aristocrats, including Lord Chancellor Bacon. Bacon entirely failed to impress the more practical-minded Harvey, who refused to regard him as a great philosopher. He said of him &quot;He writes philosophy like a Lord Chancellor.&quot;

In 1628 he published in Frankfurt his completed treatise on the circulation of the blood, the &quot;De Motu Cordis&quot;. As a result of negative comments by other physicians Harvey &quot;fell mightily in his practice&quot;, but continued advancing his career. He was re-elected &#x27;Censor&#x27; of the College of Physicians in 1629, having been elected for the first time in 1613 and the second time in 1625. Eventually, Harvey was also elected Treasurer of the College.

=== Witchcraft trials ===
Harvey was a prominent sceptic regarding allegations of witchcraft. He was one of the examiners of four women from Lancashire accused of witchcraft in 1634, and as a consequence of his report, all of them were acquitted. Earlier, in 1632, while travelling with the King to Newmarket, he had been sent to investigate a woman accused of being a witch. Initially, he told her that he was a wizard and had come to discuss the Craft with her, and asked whether she had a familiar. She put down a saucer of milk and called to a toad which came out and drank the milk. He then sent her out to fetch some ale, killed the toad and dissected it, concluding that it was a perfectly ordinary animal and not supernatural in any way. When the woman returned she was naturally very angry and upset, but Harvey eventually silenced her by stating that he was the King&#x27;s Physician, sent to discover whether she was a witch, and if she were, to have her apprehended.

=== Excursions abroad, election as physician to Charles I and the English Civil War ===
At the age of fifty-two, Harvey received commands from the king to accompany the Duke of Lennox during his trip abroad. This voyage – the first after Harvey&#x27;s return from Padua – lasted three years, taking Harvey through the countries of France and Spain during the Mantuan War and Plague. During this journey he wrote to Viscount Dorchester:
I can complain that by the way we could scarce see a dog, crow, kite, raven or any other bird, or anything to anatomize, only some few miserable people, the relics of the war and the plague where famine had made anatomies before I came. It is scarce credible in so rich, populous, and plentiful countries as these were that so much misery and desolation, poverty and famine should in so short a time be, as we have seen. I interpret it well that it will be a great motive for all here to have and procure assurance of settled peace. It is time to leave fighting when there is nothing to eat, nothing to be kept, and nothing to be gotten.
Having returned to England in 1632. Harvey accompanied King Charles I wherever he went as &#x27;Physician in Ordinary&#x27;. In particular, Charles&#x27;s hunting expeditions gave Harvey access to many deer carcasses; it was upon them that Harvey made many observations and developed his theories. Harvey returned to Italy in October 1636, dining at the English College, Rome, as a guest of the Jesuits there. It is possible he met Galileo in Florence en route.

During the English Civil War a mob of citizen-soldiers opposed to the King entered Harvey&#x27;s lodgings, stole his goods, and scattered his papers. The papers consisted of &quot;the records of a large number of dissections ... of diseased bodies, with his observations on the development on insects, and a series of notes on comparative anatomy.&quot; During this period, Harvey maintained his position, helped the wounded on several occasions and protected the King&#x27;s children during the Battle of Edgehill.

The conflicts of the Civil War soon led King Charles to Oxford, with Harvey attending, where the physician was made &quot;Doctor of Physic&quot; in 1642 and later Warden of Merton College in 1645. &quot;In Oxford he (Harvey) very soon settled down to his accustomed pursuits, unmindful of the clatter of arms and of the constant marching and countermarching around him, for the city remained the base of operations until its surrender... &quot;

=== Harvey&#x27;s later years, death and burial ===
The surrender of Oxford in 1645 marks the beginning of Harvey&#x27;s gradual retirement from public life and duties. Now sixty-eight years old and childless, Harvey had lost three brothers and his wife by this time. He thus decided to return to London, and lived with his brothers Eliab and Daniel at different periods. Having retired from St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital and his various other aforementioned positions, he passed most of this time reading general literature. Several attempts to bring Harvey back into the &#x27;working world&#x27; were made, however; here is an excerpt of one of Harvey&#x27;s answers:
Would you be the man who should recommend me to quit the peaceful haven where I now pass my life and launch again upon the faithless sea? You know full well what a storm my former lucubrations raised. Much better is it oftentimes to grow wise at home and in private, than by publishing what you have amassed with infinite labour, to stir up tempests that may rob you of peace and quiet for the rest of your days.
Harvey died at Roehampton in the house of his brother Eliab on 3 June 1657. Descriptions of the event seem to show that he died of a cerebral haemorrhage from vessels long injured by gout: it is highly probable that the left middle cerebral artery malfunctioned, leading to a gradual accumulation of blood in the brain which eventually overwhelmed it. There exists a fairly detailed account of what happened on that day. Harvey
went to speak and found that he had the dead palsy in his tongue; then he saw what was to become of him. He knew there were then no hopes of his recovery, so presently he sends for his young nephews to come up to him. He then made signs (for seized with the dead palsy in his tongue he could not speak) to let him blood his tongue, which did him little or no good, and so ended his days, dying in the evening of the day on which he was stricken, the palsy giving him an easy passport.
His will distributed his material goods and wealth throughout his extended family and also left a substantial amount of money to the Royal College of Physicians. Harvey bequeathed coffee worth £56 to them dictating that they should meet monthly and commemorate his death with coffee.

Harvey was buried in St. Andrew&#x27;s Church in Hempstead in northern Essex. The funeral procession started on 26 June 1657, leading Harvey to be placed in the &#x27;Harvey Chapel&#x27; built by Eliab. The conditions of Harvey&#x27;s burial are also known: &quot;Harvey was laid in the chapel between the bodies of his two nieces, and like them he was lapt in lead, coffin less&quot;. On St. Luke&#x27;s Day, 18 October 1883, Harvey&#x27;s remains were reinterred, the leaden case carried from the vault by eight Fellows of the College of Physicians, and deposited in a sarcophagus containing his works and an inscription:
The body of William Harvey lapt in lead, simply soldered, was laid without shell or enclosure of any kind in the Harvey vault of this Church of Hempstead, Essex, in June 1657. In the course of time the lead enclosing the remains was, from expose and natural decay, so seriously damaged as to endanger its preservation, rendering some repair of it the duty of those interested in the memory of the illustrious discoverer of the circulation of the Blood. The Royal College of Physicians, of which corporate body Harvey was a munificent Benefactor did in the years 1882–1883, by permission of the Representatives of the Harvey family, undertake this duty. In accordance with this determination the leaden mortuary chest containing the remains of Harvey was repaired, and was, as far as possible, restored to its original state...
== &quot;De Motu Cordis&quot; ==


Published in 1628 in the city of Frankfurt (host to an annual book fair that Harvey knew would allow immediate dispersion of his work), the 72-page &quot;Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus&quot; contains the mature account of the circulation of the blood. Opening with a dedication to King Charles I, the quarto has 17 chapters which give a clear and connected account of the action of the heart and the consequent movement of the blood around the body in a circuit. Having only a tiny lens at his disposal, Harvey was not able to reach the adequate pictures that were attained through such microscopes used by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek; thus he had to resort to theory and not practical evidence in certain parts of his book. After the first chapter, which simply outlines past ideas and accepted rules regarding the heart and lungs, Harvey moves on to a fundamental premise to his treatise, stating that it was important to study the heart when it was active in order to truly comprehend its true movement; a task which even he found of great difficulty, as he says:
...I found the task so truly arduous... that I was almost tempted to think... that the movement of the heart was only to be comprehended by God. For I could neither rightly perceive at first when the systole and when the diastole took place by reason of the rapidity of the movement...
This initial thought led Harvey&#x27;s ambition and assiduousness to a detailed analysis of the overall structure of the heart (studied with fewer hindrances in cold-blooded animals). After this, Harvey analyses the arteries, showing how their pulsation depends upon the contraction of the left ventricle, while the contraction of the right ventricle propels its charge of blood into the pulmonary artery. Whilst doing this, the physician reiterates the fact that these two ventricles move together almost simultaneously and not independently as had been thought previously by his predecessors. This discovery was made while observing the heart of such animals as the eel and several other types of fish; indeed, the general study of countless animals was of utmost importance to Harvey&#x27;s research: among the ones already cited, one can add the study of the snail, the invisible shrimp, the chick before its hatching and even the pigeon. A digression to an experiment can be made to this note: using the inactive heart of a dead pigeon and placing upon it a finger wet with saliva, Harvey was able to witness a transitory and yet incontrovertible pulsation. He had just witnessed the heart&#x27;s ability to recover from fatigue.
As early as the 17th century, William Harvey had already discerned the existence of the Ductus arteriosus and explained its relative function. Here he says, &quot;...in embryos, whilst the lungs are in a state of inaction, performing no function, subject to no movement any more than if they had not been present, Nature uses the two ventricles of the heart as if they formed but one for the transmission of the blood.&quot; However, the apex of Harvey&#x27;s work is probably the eighth chapter, in which he deals with the actual quantity of blood passing through the heart from the veins to the arteries. Coming into conflict with Galen&#x27;s accepted view of the liver as the origin of venous blood, Harvey estimated the capacity of the heart, how much blood is expelled through each pump of the heart, and the number of times the heart beats in a half an hour. All of these estimates were purposefully low, so that people could see the vast amount of blood Galen&#x27;s theory required the liver to produce. He estimated that the capacity of the heart was , and that every time the heart pumps, of that blood is expelled. This led to Harvey&#x27;s estimate that about of blood went through the heart every time it pumped. The next estimate he used was that the heart beats 1,000 times every half an hour, which gave 10 pounds 6 ounces of blood in a half an hour, and when this number was multiplied by 48 half hours in a day he realised that the liver would have to produce 498 pounds of blood in a day, more than the weight of the whole body.

Having this simple but essential mathematical proportion at hand – which proved the overall impossible aforementioned role of the liver – Harvey went on to prove how the blood circulated in a circle by means of countless experiments initially done on serpents and fish: tying their veins and arteries in separate periods of time, Harvey noticed the modifications which occurred; indeed, as he tied the veins, the heart would become empty, while as he did the same to the arteries, the organ would swell up.

This process was later performed on the human body (in the image on the right): the physician tied a tight ligature onto the upper arm of a person. This would cut off blood flow from the arteries and the veins. When this was done, the arm below the ligature was cool and pale, while above the ligature it was warm and swollen. The ligature was loosened slightly, which allowed blood from the arteries to come into the arm, since arteries are deeper in the flesh than the veins. When this was done, the opposite effect was seen in the lower arm. It was now warm and swollen. The veins were also more visible since now they were full of blood. Harvey then noticed little bumps in the veins, which he realised were the valves of the veins discovered by his teacher, Hieronymus Fabricius. Harvey tried to push blood in the vein down the arm, but to no avail. When he tried to push it up the arm, it moved quite easily. The same effect was seen in other veins of the body, except the veins in the neck. Those veins were different from the others – they did not allow blood to flow up, but only down. This led Harvey to believe that the veins allowed blood to flow to the heart, and the valves maintained the one-way flow.

Contrary to a popular misconception, Harvey did not predict the existence of capillaries. His observations convinced him that direct connection between veins and arteries are unnecessary; he wrote &quot;blood permeates the pores&quot; in the flesh and it is &quot;absorbed and imbibed from every part&quot; by the veins.

Harvey&#x27;s discovery of the circulation of the blood was based on inference, not direct observation, and was incompatible with the prevailing paradigm at the time. That paradigm held, among other things, that the blood could flow from one side of the heart to the other. Harvey knew that he was facing an uphill battle:

But what remains to be said about the quantity and source of the blood which thus passes, is of so novel and unheard-of character that I not only fear injury to myself from the envy of a few, but I tremble lest I have mankind at large for my enemies, so much doth want and custom, that become as another nature, and doctrine once sown and that hath struck deep root, and respect for antiquity, influence all men : still the die is cast, and my trust is in my love of truth, and the candour that inheres in cultivated minds.

Harvey&#x27;s premonitions that his discovery would be met with scepticism, derision, and abuse, were entirely justified. It took twenty years for his theory of the circulation of the blood to be generally accepted.

== Views of the circulation of blood before Harvey ==
At the time of Harvey&#x27;s publication, Galen had been an influential medical authority for several centuries. Galen believed that blood passed between the ventricles by means of invisible pores. According to Galen&#x27;s views, the venous system was quite separate from the arterial system, except when they came in contact through the unseen pores. Arabic scholar Ibn al-Nafis had disputed aspects of Galen&#x27;s views, providing a model that seems to imply a form of pulmonary circulation in his Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna&#x27;s Canon (1242). Al-Nafis stated that blood moved from the heart to the lungs, where it mixed with air, and then back to the heart, from which it spread to the rest of the body. Harvey&#x27;s discoveries inevitably and historically came into conflict with Galen&#x27;s teachings and the publication of his treatise &quot;De Motu Cordis&quot; incited considerable controversy within the medical community. Some doctors affirmed they would &quot;rather err with Galen than proclaim the truth with Harvey.&quot; Galen incompletely perceived the function of the heart, believing it a &quot;productor of heat&quot;, while the function of its affluents, the arteries, was that of cooling the blood as the lungs &quot;...fanned and cooled the heart itself&quot;. Galen thought that during dilation the arteries sucked in air, while during their contraction they discharged vapours through pores in the flesh and skin.

Until the 17th century, two separate systems were thought to be involved in blood circulation: the &quot;natural&quot; system, containing venous blood which had its origin in the liver, and the &quot;vital&quot; system, containing arterial blood and the &#x27;spirits&#x27; which flowed from the heart, distributing heat and life to all parts. Like bellows, it was thought the lungs fanned and cooled this vital blood.

Independently of Ibn Al-Nafis, Michael Servetus identified pulmonary circulation, but this discovery did not reach the public because it was written down for the first time in the Manuscript of Paris in 1546. It was later published in the theological work which caused his execution in 1553, almost all copies of which were destroyed. In: &quot;Christianismi Restitutio&quot;, Book V, the Aragonese Miguel Servet (Michel de Villeneuve, 1509?–1553) wrote: &#x27;The blood is passed through the pulmonary artery to the pulmonary vein for a lengthy pass through the lungs, during which it becomes red, and gets rid of the sooty fumes by the act of exhalation&#x27;. Ideas on circulation of blood were also proposed by the Spanish veterinarian-farrier Francisco de la Reyna in 1546.

Pulmonary circulation was described by Renaldus Columbus, Andrea Cesalpino and Vesalius, before Harvey would provide a refined and complete description of the circulatory system.

== &quot;On Animal Generation&quot; ==
Harvey&#x27;s other major work was &quot;Exercitationes de generatione animalium&quot; (&quot;On Animal Generation&quot;), published in 1651. He had been working on it for many years but might never have finished it without the encouragement of his friend George Ent.

The book starts with a description of the development of the hen&#x27;s egg. The major part is theoretical, dealing with Aristotle&#x27;s theories and the work of the physicians following Galen and up to Fabricius. Finally, he deals with embryogenesis in viviparous animals, especially hinds and does. The treatment is generally Aristotelian and limited by use of a simple magnifying lens.

Needham claims the following achievements for this work.
*His doctrine of &quot;omne vivum ex ovo&quot; (all life comes from the egg) was the first definite statement against the idea of spontaneous generation. He denied the possibility of generation from excrement and from mud, and pointed out that even worms have eggs.
*He identified the citricula as the point in the yolk from which the embryo develops and the blastoderm surrounding the embryo.
*He dismantled once and for all the Aristotelian (semen-blood) and Epicurean (semen-semen) theories of early embryogeny.
*He settled the long controversy about which parts of the egg were nutritive and which were formative, by demonstrating the unreality of the distinction.

== Legacy ==
Harvey&#x27;s whalebone demonstration rod, tipped with silver, resides in the silver room of the museum of the Royal College of Physicians. He used it to point to objects during his lectures.

Several medical buildings and institutions are named after or otherwise commemorate Harvey. The Harveian Society of Edinburgh was founded in 1782 by Dr Andrew Duncan. The Society holds an annual Festival in honour of Harvey where the President of the Society delivers the Harveian Oration, followed by a formal dinner. The venue for the Festival alternates between the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. The Harveian Society of London is a medical society founded in 1831 based in The Medical Society of London, Chandos Street, in Cavendish Square.
The Royal College of Physicians of London holds an annual lecture established by William Harvey in 1656 called the Harveian Oration. 
The Harvey Club of London was founded in Canada in 1919 and is based in the University of Western Ontario. 
The Harvey Society, found in 1905, is based in New York City and hosts an annual lecture series on recent advances in biomedical sciences. The main lecture theatre of the School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge is named after William Harvey, who was an alumnus of the institute. William Harvey Research Institute at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry is a research facility focussing on biochemical pharmacology, orthopaedic diseases, endocrinology, genomics, clinical pharmacology and translational medicine and therapeutics. William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, Kent is named after him. Harvey&#x27;s hometown of Folkestone, Kent also has a statue of him.

== Personality ==

Harvey was seen as a &quot;...humorous but extremely precise man...&quot;, and that he was often so immersed in his own thoughts that he would often suffer from insomnia (cured with a simple walk through the house), and how he was always ready for an open and direct conversation. He also loved the darkness, for it is said that it was there where &quot;...he could best contemplate&quot;, thus sometimes hiding out in caves. A heavy drinker of coffee, Harvey would walk out combing his hair every morning full of energy and enthusiastic spirit through the fields. We have also come to understand Harvey&#x27;s somewhat unorthodox method of dealing with his gout, here cited completely: &quot;...his [Harvey&#x27;s] cure was thus: he would sit with his legs bare...put them into a pail of water till he was almost dead with cold, then betake himself to his stove, and so &#x27;twas gone&quot;.

<doc id="50206" wikidata="Q11270" url="?curid=50206" title="Fulgencio Batista">
<text>Fulgencio Batista y Zaldívar (born Rubén Zaldívar; January 16, 1901 – August 6, 1973) was a Cuban military officer and politician who played a dominant role in Cuban politics from his initial rise to power as part of the 1933 Revolt of the Sergeants. He ruled Cuba as a military dictator until his overthrow in the Cuban Revolution in 1959. He served as president of Cuba from 1940 to 1944, and again from 1952 to his 1959 resignation.

Raised in humble circumstances, Batista first came to prominence in the Revolt of the Sergeants, which overthrew the provisional government of Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada. Batista then appointed himself chief of the armed forces, with the rank of colonel, and effectively controlled the five-member &quot;pentarchy&quot; that functioned as the collective head of state. He maintained control through a series of puppet presidents until 1940, when he was elected president on a populist platform. He then instated the 1940 Constitution of Cuba and presided over Cuban support for the Allies during World War II. After finishing his term in 1944, Batista moved to Florida, returning to Cuba to run for president in 1952. Facing certain electoral defeat, he led a military coup against President Carlos Prío Socarrás that pre-empted the election.

Back in power and receiving financial, military and logistical support from the United States government, Batista suspended the 1940 Constitution and revoked most political liberties, including the right to strike. He then aligned with the wealthiest landowners who owned the largest sugar plantations, and presided over a stagnating economy that widened the gap between rich and poor Cubans. Eventually, it reached the point where most of the sugar industry was in U.S. hands, and foreigners owned 70% of the arable land. As such, Batista&#x27;s repressive government then began to systematically profit from the exploitation of Cuba&#x27;s commercial interests, by negotiating lucrative relationships both with the American Mafia, who controlled the drug, gambling, and prostitution businesses in Havana, and with large U.S.-based multinational companies who were awarded lucrative contracts. To quell the growing discontent amongst the populace—which was subsequently displayed through frequent student riots and demonstrations—Batista established tighter censorship of the media, while also utilizing his Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities secret police to carry out wide-scale violence, torture and public executions. These murders mounted in 1957, as socialist ideas became more influential. While exact numbers are unclear, estimates of the death toll attributed to Batista range from hundreds to up to 20,000 victims. 

Batista&#x27;s efforts to quell the unrest proved not only ineffective, but his tactics were the catalyst to even wider resistance against his regime. During this time, revolutionary leaders Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, founders of the July 26th Movement began a resistance campaign that saw a combination of peaceful protests and guerrilla warfare in both rural and urban areas of Cuba between 1956 and 1958. After almost two years of fighting, rebel forces led by Guevara successfully defeated Batista&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Santa Clara on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1958, effectively collapsing the regime. On January 1, 1959, Batista announced his resignation, fleeing the country to the Dominican Republic under the protection of Rafael Trujillo, before settling in Portugal, spending the rest of his life in exile until his death in 1973.

==Early life==

Batista was born in the town of Veguita, located in the municipality of Banes, Cuba, in 1901 to Belisario Batista Palermo and Carmela Zaldívar González, who had fought in the Cuban War of Independence. He was of Spanish, African, Chinese, and possibly some Taíno descent. Both Batista&#x27;s parents are believed to have been of mixed race and one may have had Indigenous Caribbean blood. His mother named him Rubén and gave him her last name, Zaldívar. His father did not want to register him as a Batista. In the registration records of the Banes courthouse, he was legally Rubén Zaldívar until 1939, when he tried to register as a presidential candidate under the name Fulgencio Batista. When it was discovered that no birth certificate existed for a &quot;Fulgencio Batista&quot;, he had to postpone his candidacy registration and pay 15,000 pesos to the local judge.

Batista was initially educated at a public school in Banes and later attended night classes at an American Quaker school. He left home at age 14, after the death of his mother. Coming from a humble background, he earned a living as a laborer in the cane fields, docks, and railroads. He was a tailor, mechanic, charcoal vendor and fruit peddler. In 1921, he traveled to Havana, and in April joined the army as a private. After learning shorthand and typing, Batista left the army in 1923, working briefly as a teacher of stenography before enlisting in the &quot;Guardia Rural&quot; (rural police). He transferred back to the army as a corporal, becoming secretary to a regimental colonel. In September 1933, he held the rank of sergeant stenographer and as such acted as the secretary of a group of non-commissioned officers who led a &quot;sergeants&#x27; conspiracy&quot; for better conditions and improved prospects of promotion.

==1933 coup==
In 1933, Batista led an uprising called the Sergeants&#x27; Revolt, as part of the coup that overthrew the government of Gerardo Machado. Machado was succeeded by Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada, who lacked a political coalition that could sustain him and was soon replaced.

A short-lived five-member presidency, known as the Pentarchy of 1933, was established. The Pentarchy included a representative from each anti-Machado faction. Batista was not a member, but controlled Cuba&#x27;s armed forces. Within days, the representative for the students and professors of the University of Havana, Ramón Grau San Martín, was made president—and Batista became the Army Chief of Staff, with the rank of colonel, effectively putting him in control of the presidency. The majority of the commissioned officer corps were forced to retire or, some speculate, were killed.

Grau remained president for just over 100 days before Batista, conspiring with the U.S. envoy Sumner Welles, forced him to resign in January 1934. Grau was replaced by Carlos Mendieta, and within five days the U.S. recognized Cuba&#x27;s new government, which lasted eleven months. Batista then became the strongman behind a succession of puppet presidents until he was elected president in 1940. After Mendieta, succeeding governments were led by José Agripino Barnet (five months) and Miguel Mariano Gómez (seven months) before Federico Laredo Brú ruled from December 1936 to October 1940.

==Constitutional presidency (1940–1944)==
Batista defeated Grau in the first presidential election (1940) under the new Cuban constitution, and served a four-year term as President of Cuba, the first and to this day only non-white Cuban in that office. Batista was endorsed by the Democratic Socialist Coalition and the original Cuban Communist Party (later known as the Popular Socialist Party), which at the time had little significance and no probability of an electoral victory. This support was primarily due to Batista&#x27;s early advocacy of strengthening labor laws and his support for labor unions, with which the Communists had close ties, as well as the pro-Allied stance in World War II. Also Batista supported in his first term Corporatism. Communists attacked the anti-Batista opposition, saying Grau and others were &quot;fascists&quot; and &quot;reactionaries.&quot; During this term in office, Batista carried out major social reforms and established numerous economic regulations and pro-union policies.

Cuba entered World War II on the side of the Allies on December 9, 1941, declaring war on Japan two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor. On December 11, the Batista government declared war on Germany and Italy. In December 1942, after a friendly visit to Washington, Batista said Latin America would applaud if the Declaration by United Nations called for war with Francisco Franco&#x27;s Spain, calling the regime fascist.

==Post-presidency==
In 1944, Batista&#x27;s handpicked successor, Carlos Saladrigas Zayas, was defeated by Grau. In the final months of his presidency, Batista sought to handicap the incoming Grau administration. In a July 17, 1944, dispatch to the U.S. Secretary of State, U.S. Ambassador Spruille Braden wrote:

Shortly after, Batista left Cuba for the United States. &quot;I just felt safer there,&quot; he said. He divorced his wife, Elisa Godínez, and married Marta Fernández in 1945. Two of their four children were born in the United States.

For the next eight years, Batista remained in the background, spending time in the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City and a home in Daytona Beach, Florida.

He continued to participate in Cuban politics and was elected to the Cuban Senate &quot;in absentia&quot; in 1948. Returning to Cuba, he decided to run for president and received permission from President Grau, whereupon he formed the United Action Party. On taking power he founded the Progressive Action Party, but he never regained his former popular support, though the unions supported him until the end.

==Military coup and dictatorship (1952–1959)==

In 1952, Batista again ran for president. In a three-way race, Roberto Agramonte of the Orthodox Party led in all the polls, followed by Carlos Hevia of the Authentic Party. Batista&#x27;s United Action coalition was running a distant third.

On March 10, 1952, three months before the elections, Batista, with army backing, staged a coup and seized power. He ousted outgoing President Carlos Prío Socarrás, canceled the elections and took control of the government as a provisional president. The United States recognized his government on March 27. When asked by the U.S. government to analyze Batista&#x27;s Cuba, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. said:

The corruption of the Government, the brutality of the police, the government&#x27;s indifference to the needs of the people for education, medical care, housing, for social justice and economic justice ... is an open invitation to revolution.

===Economy of Cuba===
Upon his seizure of power, Batista inherited a country that was relatively prosperous for Latin America. According to Batista&#x27;s fascist government, although a third of Cubans still lived in poverty, Cuba was one of the five most developed countries in the region. In the 1950s, Cuba&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was roughly equal to that of Italy at the time, although still only a sixth of that of the United States. Moreover, although corruption and inequality were rife under Batista, Cuban industrial workers&#x27; wages rose significantly. In 1953, the average Cuban family only had an income of $6.00 a week, 15% to 20% of the labor force was chronically unemployed, and only a third of the homes had running water. Despite this, according to the International Labour Organization, the average industrial salary in Cuba became the world&#x27;s eighth-highest in 1958, and the average agricultural wage was higher than some European nations (although, according to one sample from 1956 to 1957, agricultural workers could only find employment for an average of 123 days per year while farm owners, rural tenants and sharecroppers worked an average of only 135 days per year). Not like in his first term, where he advocated for Corporatism, he began to advocate for Economic liberalism.

===Relationship with organized crime===
Throughout the 1950s, Havana served as &quot;a hedonistic playground for the world&#x27;s elite&quot;, producing sizable gambling, prostitution and drug profits for the American mafia, corrupt law-enforcement officials, and their politically elected cronies. In the assessment of the Cuban-American historian Louis Perez, &quot;Havana was then what Las Vegas has become.&quot; Relatedly, it is estimated that by the end of the 1950s the city of Havana had 270 brothels. In addition, drugs, be it marijuana or cocaine, were so plentiful at the time that one American magazine in 1950 proclaimed &quot;Narcotics are hardly more difficult to obtain in Cuba than a shot of rum. And only slightly more expensive.&quot; As a result, the playwright Arthur Miller described Batista&#x27;s Cuba in &quot;The Nation&quot; as &quot;hopelessly corrupt, a Mafia playground, (and) a bordello for Americans and other foreigners.&quot;

In a bid to profit from such an environment, Batista established lasting relationships with organized crime, notably with American mobsters Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano, and under his rule Havana became known as &quot;the Latin Las Vegas&quot;. Batista and Lansky formed a friendship and business relationship that flourished for a decade. During a stay at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York in the late 1940s, it was mutually agreed that, in return for kickbacks, Batista would give Lansky and the Mafia control of Havana&#x27;s racetracks and casinos. After World War II, Luciano was paroled from prison on the condition that he permanently return to Sicily. Luciano secretly moved to Cuba, where he worked to resume control over American Mafia operations. Luciano also ran a number of casinos in Cuba with the sanction of Batista, though the American government eventually succeeded in pressuring the Batista government to deport him.

Batista encouraged large-scale gambling in Havana. In 1955, he announced that Cuba would grant a gaming license to anyone who invested US$1 million in a hotel or $200,000 in a new nightclub—and that the government would provide matching public funds for construction, a 10-year tax exemption, and waive duties on imported equipment and furnishings for new hotels. Each casino would pay the government $250,000 for the license, plus a percentage of the profits. The policy omitted background checks, as required for casino operations in the United States, which opened the door for casino investors with illegally obtained funds. Cuban contractors with the right connections made windfalls by importing, duty-free, more materials than needed for new hotels and selling the surplus to others. It was rumored that, besides the $250,000 to obtain a license, an additional &quot;under the table&quot; fee was sometimes required.

Lansky became a prominent figure in Cuba&#x27;s gambling operations, and exerted influence over Batista&#x27;s casino policies. The Mafia&#x27;s Havana Conference was held on December 22, 1946, at the Hotel Nacional de Cuba; this was the first full-scale meeting of American underworld leaders since the Chicago meeting in 1932. Lansky set about cleaning up the games at the Montmartre Club, which soon became the &quot;place to be&quot; in Havana. He also wanted to open a casino in the Hotel Nacional, the most elegant hotel in Havana. Batista endorsed Lansky&#x27;s idea over the objections of American expatriates such as Ernest Hemingway, and the renovated casino wing opened for business in 1955 with a show by Eartha Kitt. The casino was an immediate success.

As the new hotels, nightclubs, and casinos opened, Batista collected his share of the profits. Nightly, the &quot;bagman&quot; for his wife collected 10% of the profits at Santo Trafficante&#x27;s casinos, the Sans Souci cabaret, and the casinos in the hotels Sevilla-Biltmore, Commodoro, Deauville, and Capri (partly owned by the actor George Raft). His take from the Lansky casinos—his prized Habana Riviera, the Hotel Nacional, the Montmartre Club, and others—was said to be 30%. Lansky was said to have personally contributed millions of dollars per year to Batista&#x27;s Swiss bank accounts.

===Support of U.S. business and government===


In a manner that antagonized the Cuban people, the U.S. government used its influence to advance the interests of and increase the profits of the private American companies, which &quot;dominated the island&#x27;s economy&quot;. By the late 1950s, U.S. financial interests owned 90% of Cuban mines, 80% of its public utilities, 50% of its railways, 40% of its sugar production and 25% of its bank deposits—some $1 billion in total. According to historian Louis A. Pérez Jr., author of the book &quot;On Becoming Cuban&quot;, &quot;Daily life had developed into a relentless degradation, with the complicity of political leaders and public officials who operated at the behest of American interests.&quot; As a symbol of this relationship, ITT Corporation, an American-owned multinational telephone company, presented Batista with a Golden Telephone, as an &quot;expression of gratitude&quot; for the &quot;excessive telephone rate increase&quot;, at least according to Senator John F. Kennedy, that Batista granted at the urging of the U.S. government.

Earl E.T. Smith, former U.S. Ambassador to Cuba, testified to the U.S. Senate in 1960 that, &quot;Until Castro, the U.S. was so overwhelmingly influential in Cuba that the American ambassador was the second most important man, sometimes even more important than the Cuban president.&quot; In addition, nearly &quot;all aid&quot; from the U.S. to Batista&#x27;s government was in the &quot;form of weapons assistance&quot;, which &quot;merely strengthened the Batista dictatorship&quot; and &quot;completely failed to advance the economic welfare of the Cuban people&quot;. Such actions later &quot;enabled Castro and the Communists to encourage the growing belief that America was indifferent to Cuban aspirations for a decent life.&quot;

According to historian and author James S. Olson, the U.S. government essentially became a &quot;co-conspirator&quot; in the arrangement because of Batista&#x27;s strong opposition to communism, which, in the rhetoric of the Cold War, seemed to maintain business stability and a pro-U.S. posture on the island. Thus, in the view of Olson, &quot;The U.S. government had no difficulty in dealing with him, even if he was a hopeless despot.&quot; On October 6, 1960, Senator John F. Kennedy, in the midst of his campaign for the U.S. presidency, decried Batista&#x27;s relationship with the U.S. government and criticized the Eisenhower administration for supporting him.

===Batista, Fidel Castro and the Cuban Revolution===

On July 26, 1953, just over a year after Batista&#x27;s second coup, a small group of revolutionaries attacked the Moncada Barracks in Santiago. Government forces easily defeated the assault and jailed its leaders, while many others fled the country. The primary leader of the attack, Fidel Castro, was a young attorney who had run for parliament in the canceled 1952 elections. Although Castro was never officially nominated, he felt that Batista&#x27;s coup had sidetracked what would have been a promising political career for him. In the wake of the Moncada assault, Batista suspended constitutional guarantees and increasingly relied on police tactics in an attempt to &quot;frighten the population through open displays of brutality.&quot;

Batista held an election in 1954, running as the candidate of a political coalition that included the Progressive Action Party, the Radical Union Party and the Liberal Party. The opposition divided into abstentionists and electoralists. The abstentionists favored boycotting the elections regardless of the circumstances in which they were held, whereas the electoralists sought certain rights and guarantees to participate. The CIA had predicted that Batista would use any means necessary to ensure he won the election. Batista lived up to their expectations, utilizing fraud and intimidation to secure his presidency. This led most of the other parties to boycott the elections. Former President Ramón Grau San Martín, leading the electoralist factions of the Cuban Revolutionary Party, participated through the political campaign but withdrew from the campaign days before election day, charging that his supporters had been terrorized. Thus Batista was elected president with the support of 45.6% of registered voters. Despite the boycott, Grau received the support of 6.8% of those who voted. The remaining voters abstained.

By late 1955, student riots and anti-Batista demonstrations had become frequent, and unemployment became a problem as graduates entering the workforce could not find jobs. These were dealt with through increasing repression. All youth were seen as suspected revolutionaries. Due to its continued opposition to Batista and the large amount of revolutionary activity taking place on its campus, the University of Havana was temporarily closed on November 30, 1956 (it did not reopen until 1959 under the first revolutionary government). On March 13, 1957, student leader José Antonio Echeverría was killed by police outside Radio Reloj in Havana after announcing that Batista had been killed in a student attack on the Presidential Palace. In reality, Batista survived, and the students of the Federation of University Students (FEU) and the Directorio Revolucionario (DR) who led the attack were killed in the response by the military and police. Castro quickly condemned the attack, since July 26 Movement had not participated in it.

In April 1956, Batista called popular military leader Col. Ramón Barquín back to Cuba from his post as military attaché to the United States. Believing Barquín would support his rule, Batista promoted him to General. However, Barquín&#x27;s &quot;Conspiración de los Puros&quot; (Conspiracy of the Pure) was already underway and had already progressed too far. On April 6, 1956, Barquín led hundreds of career officers in a coup attempt, but was frustrated by Lieutenant Ríos Morejón, who betrayed the plan. Barquín was sentenced to solitary confinement for eight years on the Isle of Pines, while some officers were sentenced to death for treason. Many others were allowed to remain in the military without reprimand.

The purge of the officer corps contributed to the inability of the Cuban army to successfully combat Castro and his guerrillas. Batista&#x27;s police responded to increasing popular unrest by torturing and killing young men in the cities. However, his army was ineffective against the rebels based in the Sierra Maestra and Escambray Mountains. Another possible explanation for the failure to crush the rebellion was offered by author Carlos Alberto Montaner: &quot;Batista does not finish Fidel out of greed ... His is a government of thieves. To have this small guerrilla band in the mountains is to his advantage, so that he can order special defense expenditures that they can steal.&quot; Batista&#x27;s rule became increasingly unpopular among the population, and the Soviet Union began to secretly support Castro. Some of Batista&#x27;s generals also criticized him in later years, saying that Batista&#x27;s excessive interference in his generals&#x27; military plans to defeat the rebels hampered Army morale and rendered all operations ineffective.

In an effort to gather information about Castro&#x27;s army, Batista&#x27;s secret police pulled in people for questioning. Many innocent people were tortured by Batista&#x27;s secret police, while suspects, including youth, were publicly executed as a warning to others who were considering joining the insurgency. Additionally, &quot;Hundreds of mangled bodies were left hanging from lamp posts or dumped in the streets in a grotesque variation of the Spanish colonial practice of public executions.&quot; The brutal behavior backfired and increased support for the guerrillas. In 1958, 45 organizations signed an open letter supporting July 26 Movement, among them national bodies representing lawyers, architects, dentists, accountants, and social workers.

The United States supplied Batista with planes, ships, tanks and the latest technology, such as napalm, which he used against the insurgency. However, in March 1958, the U.S. announced it would stop selling arms to the Cuban government. Soon after, the U.S. imposed an arms embargo, further weakening the government&#x27;s position, although landowners and others who benefited from the government continued to support Batista.

Elections were scheduled for June 1958, as required by the Constitution, but were delayed until November 1958, when Castro and the revolutionaries called for a general strike and placed several bombs in civilian areas of the country. Three main candidates ran in the elections: Carlos Márquez Sterling of the Party of the Free People, former President Ramón Grau San Martín of the Cuban Revolutionary Party-Authentic, and Andrés Rivero Agüero of the government coalition. According to Carlos Márquez Sterling, all three were threatened by Castro, and several assassination attempts were made on both Ramón Grau San Martín and Carlos Márquez Sterling. On Election Day, estimates on the turnout range from 30 to 50% in the areas where voting took place, which did not include parts of Las Villas and Oriente, which were controlled by Castro. Márquez Sterling also stated that the initial results were favorable to him, but the military ordered the counting to stop as they changed the actual ballots for fraudulent ones. However, Grau San Martín, as he had previously done in the 1954 elections, withdrew his candidacy within a few hours of the election day. Batista declared Rivero Agüero the winner.

The U.S. rejected the results of the elections and announced plans to withhold diplomatic recognition of the Rivero Agüero government. The American ambassador to Cuba Earl Smith informed Agüero that the United States would not give aid and support to his government. Smith also informed Batista that the U.S. believed him incapable of maintaining effective control and that he should retire.

On December 31, 1958, at a New Year&#x27;s Eve party, Batista told his cabinet and top officials that he was leaving the country and resigned. After seven years, Batista knew his presidency was over, and he fled the island in the early morning. At 3:00 a.m. on January 1, 1959, Batista boarded a plane at Camp Columbia with 40 of his supporters and immediate family members and flew to Ciudad Trujillo in the Dominican Republic. A second plane flew out of Havana later in the night, carrying ministers, officers and the Governor of Havana. Batista took along a personal fortune of more than $300 million that he had amassed through graft and payoffs. Critics accused Batista and his supporters of taking as much as $700 million in fine art and cash with them as they fled into exile.

As news of the fall of Batista&#x27;s government spread through Havana, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described jubilant crowds pouring into the streets and automobile horns honking. The black and red flag of the July 26 Movement waved on cars and buildings. The atmosphere was chaotic. On January 8, 1959, Castro and his army rolled victoriously into Havana. Already denied entry to the United States, Batista sought asylum in Mexico, which also refused him. Portugal&#x27;s leader António Salazar allowed him to settle there on the condition that he completely abstain from politics.

Historians and primary documents estimate between hundreds and 20,000 Cubans were killed under the Batista regime which has been molded into a totalitarian, fascist and hereditary dictatorship.

However, the 20,000 number is disputed by several historians, which considered it as ‘propaganda’. According to French historian Jeannine Verdès-Leroux:

== Disputed death count ==
People were killed, with estimates ranging from hundreds to a maximum of 20,000, although this high figure is disputed.

The figure of 20,000 was first written in &quot;Bohemia&quot; – the most popular magazine in Cuba – by Enrique de la Osa. Historical consensus maintains that De la Osa – a hardline communist and fierce friend to Fidel Castro – completely fabricated this figure, among many other fabrications he wrote in the famous section of &quot;Bohemia&quot; he directed that was called &quot;&quot;En Cuba.&quot;&quot; Fidel Castro later positioned Enrique de la Osa to become director of &quot;Bohemia,&quot; and forced Miguel Ángel Quevedo into exile.

These tactics ultimately failed to quell unrest and instead were the catalyst for more widespread resistance. For two years (December 1956 – December 1958) Fidel Castro&#x27;s 26th of July Movement and other rebelling elements led an urban- and rural-based guerrilla uprising against Batista&#x27;s fascist government, which culminated in his eventual defeat by the communist rebels under the command of Che Guevara at the Battle of Santa Clara on New Year&#x27;s Day 1959. Batista immediately fled the island with an amassed personal fortune to the Dominican Republic, where strongman and previous military ally Rafael Trujillo held power. Batista eventually found political asylum in António Salazar&#x27;s Portugal, where he first lived on the island of Madeira and then in Estoril. He was involved in business activities in Francoist Spain and was staying there in Marbella at the time of his death from a heart attack in 1973.

==Personal life==

===Marriages and children===
Batista married Elisa Godínez y Gómez on July 10, 1926. They had three children: Mirta Caridad (1927–2010), Elisa Aleida (born 1933), and Fulgencio Rubén Batista Godínez (1933–2007). By all accounts, she was devoted to him and their children throughout their marriage, and their daughter remembered them as a &quot;happy, young couple&quot; until their sudden divorce. Much to her surprise, he divorced her in October 1945 against her will in order to marry his longtime mistress Marta Fernández Miranda.

He married Fernández on November 28, 1945, shortly after his divorce became final, and they had five children: Jorge Luis (born 1942), Roberto Francisco (born 1947), Carlos Manuel (1950–1969), Fulgencio José (born 1953) and Marta María Batista Fernández (born 1957).

====Extramarital affairs====
Batista was an inveterate philanderer who engaged in numerous extramarital affairs throughout his first marriage. He cheated on his first wife with multiple women, and his children eventually became aware of his relationships. His first wife, who supported her husband throughout his political career and found his philandering humiliating, never considered divorce and tolerated his multiple affairs. However, Batista became enamored with the much younger Marta Fernández Miranda, who became his longtime mistress. He filed divorce papers shortly before his first grandchild was born. His first wife and their children were astounded and devastated by the divorce.

In 1935, he had with his mistress Marina Estévez an illegitimate daughter, Fermina Lázara Carmela de las Mercedes Batista Estévez, whom he supported financially.

==Death==
After he fled to Portugal, Batista lived in Madeira, then later in Estoril. He died of a heart attack on August 6, 1973, in Marbella, Spain.

Marta Fernández Miranda de Batista, Batista&#x27;s widow, died on October 2, 2006. Roberto Batista, her son, said that she died at her home in West Palm Beach, Florida, US. She had suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

<text>Porvoo (; ; ) is a city in Finland. It is located on the south coast of the country, on the Gulf of Finland. Porvoo lies in the eastern part of the Uusimaa region. The population of Porvoo is approximately , while the sub-region has a population of approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland, and the 15th most populous urban area in the country.

Porvoo is located on the southern coast of Finland, approximately east of the city border of Helsinki and about from the city centre. Porvoo was one of the six medieval towns of Finland, along with Turku, Ulvila, Rauma, Naantali and Vyborg, and is first mentioned as a city in texts from the 14th century. Porvoo is the seat of the Swedish-speaking Diocese of Borgå of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland. Porvoo briefly served as the capital of the former Eastern Uusimaa region.

Porvoo Old Town (; ) is a popular tourist destination, known for its well-preserved 18th- and 19th-century buildings, and the 15th-century Porvoo Cathedral. The Old Town and the Porvoonjoki River Valley are recognized as, together, one of the National landscapes of Finland. 

Porvoo is a bilingual municipality with Finnish and Swedish as its official languages. The population consists of Finnish speakers, Swedish speakers, and speakers of other languages.

The municipalities neighbouring Porvoo are Askola, Loviisa, Myrskylä, Pornainen, and Sipoo; and the sub-region maintained by Porvoo includes Askola, Myrskylä and Pukkila.

==Etymology==
The town received its name from a Swedish medieval fortress near the river Porvoonjoki, which flows through the town. The name &quot;Porvoo&quot; is the Fennicised version of the Swedish name &quot;&quot;, which is derived from , meaning &quot;castle&quot; and , &quot;river&quot;.

==Heraldry==
The coat of arms of Porvoo, based on the medieval seal of the city, is &quot;Azure [blue], a tulip-shaped letter C argent [silver].&quot; The main object in the arms has been interpreted as either a fire iron or the letter C, referring to the Latin word for &quot;castle&quot; (). A version of the arms redrawn by Gustaf von Numers was approved for official use by the Porvoo City Council on March 23, 1960, and the Ministry of the Interior confirmed the use of the coat of arms on June 1 the same year.

==History==

The area of Porvoo has been inhabited since the Stone Age. In prehistoric times, the river Porvoonjoki was a route of commerce for Finnish tribal Tavastians who primarily inhabited the inland regions. The Tavastians also had some permanent settlements in the area, such as the village of Hattula (later Strömsberg), which was named after an inland Tavastian village. The original name of the river Porvoonjoki was possibly &quot;Kukinjoki&quot;. The name derives from the name of the trade vessel cog which was a common merchant ship in the Baltic Sea in medieval times. The early center of the area was &quot;Saksala&quot;, meaning &quot;the place of the Germans&quot;, and deriving from the merchants who were trading in Saksala.

Porvoo was colonised by Swedes in the 13th and 14th centuries after the so-called Second Crusade against Tavastians in 1249–1250. The colonisation was led by the Catholic Church and the kingdom of Sweden. The colonists originated from Svealand, and were provided with seeds, cattle and, tax exemption for four years.

The oldest known written mentions of Porvoo are from the early 14th century. In circa 1380, Porvoo became the third town in Finland to be granted official town rights, after Turku in 1229 and Ulvila in 1365. However, it is also claimed to have been founded as early as 1347, which would make it the second oldest after Turku. Due to land rise and loss of shipping access, Ulvila lost town rights to nearby Pori in 1558.

When Sweden lost the city of Vyborg to Russia in 1721, the episcopal see was moved to Porvoo in 1723. At this time, Porvoo was the second largest city in Finland.

In 1760, roughly two-thirds of all buildings in Porvoo burned to the ground in a conflagration. During rebuilding, the city planning wasn&#x27;t altered, instead new buildings were built upon the existing medieval foundations.

After the conquest of Finland by Russian armies in 1808, Sweden had to cede Finland to Russia in 1809 (the Treaty of Fredrikshamn). The Diet of Porvoo in 1809 was a landmark in the History of Finland as tsar Alexander I made Finland an autonomous Grand Duchy. In 1923, six years after Finland&#x27;s independence, the former Diocese of Vyborg, which operated in Porvoo, was replaced by a current Swedish-speaking diocese of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, the Diocese of Porvoo.

The &quot;Porvoo Common Statement&quot; is a report issued at the conclusion of theological conversations by official representatives of four Anglican churches and eight Nordic and Baltic Lutheran churches in 1989–1992. It established the Porvoo Communion, so named after the Porvoo Cathedral where the Eucharist was celebrated on the final Sunday of the conversations leading to the Statement.

The old city of Porvoo was formally disestablished and the new city of Porvoo founded in 1997, when the city of Porvoo and the rural municipality of Porvoo were consolidated.

==Urban development==
===Old Town===
The town is famed for its &quot;Old Town&quot; (&#x27; in Finnish, &#x27; in Swedish), a dense medieval street pattern with predominantly wooden houses from the 17th and 18th centuries. The Old Town came close to being demolished in the 19th century by a new urban plan for the city, but the plan was canceled due to a popular resistance headed by Count Louis Sparre. With the need for growth, a plan was envisioned for a new town built adjacent to the Old Town, following a grid plan, but with houses also built of wood. Jokikatu (located eastside of the Porvoonjoki River) is one of Porvoo&#x27;s pedestrian streets, and like the other similar streets of the Old Town, it also includes a variety of restaurants, coffeehouses, antique shops and other stores.

The central point of the old town is the medieval, stone and brick Porvoo Cathedral. The cathedral gave its name to the Porvoo Communion, an inter-church agreement between a number of Anglican and Lutheran denominations. The cathedral is reminiscent of similarly aged churches across Finland, such as the Church of St. Lawrence, Vantaa, as they were designed by the same person, the anonymous German architect &quot;Pernajan mestari&quot;. The Diocese of Borgå that unites the Swedish speaking lutheran congregations, resides here. The cathedral has burned down 5 times. The latest fire happened on 29 May 2006; the roof was totally destroyed but the interior is largely intact. A drunken youth had started a fire at the church, unaware of recent tar work and nearby tar containers, accidentally causing a large conflagration. He was later sentenced to a short prison term and restitutions of 4.3 million euro.

The Old Town is a significant source of tourism in the area. Visitors to the capital Helsinki can embark on day trips to visit the older city. The Old Town also hosts various events, such as an annual Christmas market.

===Later developments===
By the end of the 20th century, there was pressure to develop the essentially untouched western side of the river. There was concern that growth would necessitate the construction of a second bridge across the river into the town, thus putting further strain on the aging wooden town. An architectural competition was held in 1990, the winning entry of which proposed building the second bridge. Plans for the western side of the river have progressed under the direction of architect Tuomas Siitonen, and both a vehicle bridge and a pedestrian bridge have been built. The design for new housing is based on a typology derived from the old storehouses on the opposite side of the river. Yet another new development entails the construction of a large business park called King&#x27;s Gate (, ), which is under construction.

The Porvoo railway station does not have a regular train service, but special museum trains from Kerava (either with steam locomotives or former VR diesel railcars from the 1950s) operate on summer weekends.

The new hotel called Runo Hotel was opened in the old town of Porvoo on May 31, 2021.

<doc id="50213" wikidata="Q210761" url="?curid=50213" title="Morganatic marriage">
<text>Morganatic marriage, sometimes called a left-handed marriage, is a marriage between people of unequal social rank, which in the context of royalty or other inherited title prevents the principal&#x27;s position or privileges being passed to the spouse, or any children born of the marriage. The concept is most prevalent in German-speaking territories and countries most influenced by the customs of the German-speaking realms.

Generally, this is a marriage between a man of high birth (such as from a reigning, deposed or mediatised dynasty) and a woman of lesser status (such as a daughter of a low-ranked noble family or a commoner). Usually, neither the bride nor any children of the marriage has a claim on the husband&#x27;s succession rights, titles, precedence, or entailed property. The children are considered legitimate for all other purposes and the prohibition against bigamy applies. In some countries, a woman could also marry a man of lower rank morganatically. 

==German background==
After World War I, the heads of both ruling and formerly reigning German dynasties initially continued the practice of rejecting dynastic titles and/or rights for descendants of &quot;morganatic&quot; unions, but gradually allowed them, sometimes retroactively, effectively de-morganatizing the wives and children. This was accommodated by Perthes&#x27; &quot;Almanach de Gotha&quot; (which categorised German princely families by rank until it ceased publication after 1944) by inserting the offspring of such marriages in a third section of the almanac under entries denoted by a symbol (a dot within a circle) that &quot;signifies some princely houses which, possessing no specific princely patent, have passed from the first part, A, or from the second part into the third part in virtue of special agreements&quot;. The &quot;Fürstliche Häuser&quot; (&quot;Princely Houses&quot;) series of the &quot;Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels&quot; (&quot;Genealogical Manual of the Nobility&quot;) has followed this lead, likewise enrolling some issue of unapproved marriages in its third section, &quot;III B&quot;, with a similar explanation: &quot;Families in this section, although verified, received no specific decree, but have been included by special agreement in the 1st and 2nd sections&quot;.

Variations of morganatic marriage were also practised by non-European dynasties, such as the Royal Family of Thailand, the polygamous Mongols as to their non-principal wives, and other families of Africa and Asia.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Morganatic&quot;, already in use in English by 1727 (according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;), is derived from the medieval Latin &quot;morganaticus&quot; from the Late Latin phrase &quot;matrimonium ad morganaticam&quot; and refers to the gift given by the groom to the bride on the morning after the wedding, the morning gift, i.e., dower. The Latin term, applied to a Germanic custom, was adopted from the Old High German term &quot;*morgangeba&quot; (modern German &quot;Morgengabe&quot;), corresponding to Early English &quot;morgengifu&quot;. The literal meaning is explained in a 16th-century passage quoted by Du Cange as, &quot;a marriage by which the wife and the children that may be born are entitled to no share in the husband&#x27;s possessions beyond the &#x27;morning-gift&#x27;&quot;.

The &quot;morning gift&quot; has been a customary property arrangement for marriage found first in early medieval Germanic cultures (such as the Lombards) and also among ancient Germanic tribes, and the church drove its adoption into other countries in order to improve the wife&#x27;s security by this &quot;additional&quot; benefit. The bride received property from the bridegroom&#x27;s clan. It was intended to ensure her livelihood in widowhood, and it was to be kept separate as the wife&#x27;s discrete possession. However, when a marriage contract is made wherein the bride and the children of the marriage will not receive anything else (other than the dower) from the bridegroom or from his inheritance or clan, that sort of marriage was dubbed as &quot;marriage with only the dower and no other inheritance&quot;, i.e., &quot;matrimonium morganaticum&quot;.

== Examples ==
Royal men who married morganatically:
* Genghis Khan followed the contemporary tradition by taking several morganatic wives in addition to his principal wife, whose property passed to their youngest son, also following tradition.
* Ludwig Wilhelm, Duke in Bavaria and actress Henriette Mendel. She was created Baroness von Wallersee, and their daughter, Marie Louise, Countess Larisch von Moennich, was a confidante of her aunt Empress Elisabeth (&quot;Sissi&quot;) of Austria.
* Archduke Ferdinand II of Austria, ruler of the Tirol, first married Philippine Welser, a bourgeoise of a wealthy family in 1557. Their children were given the title Margrave von Burgau, the issue of Ferdinand&#x27;s second (and equal) marriage being of archducal rank and preferred for purposes of inheritance.
* Victor Emmanuel II of Italy in 1869 married morganatically his principal mistress Rosa Teresa Vercellana Guerrieri. Popularly known in Piedmontese as &quot;Bela Rosin&quot; (Little Rosa the Beautiful), she was born a commoner but made Countess di Mirafiori e Fontanafredda in 1858.
* Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine in 1851 married morganatically Countess Julia von Hauke. Instead of being part of the House of Hesse-Darmstadt to which their father belonged, their patrilinear descendants were created Princes of Battenberg, whose branch living in the United Kingdom later became House of Mountbatten.
* Late in his life, the widowed ex-king Fernando II of Portugal married the opera singer Elise Hensler, who was created Countess von Edla.
* In 1917, the grandson of Fernando II of Portugal, Afonso, Duke of Porto, the last Prince Royal of Portugal, married the twice-divorced American socialite Nevada Stoody Hayes.
* In 1929, Alfonso de Borbón y Borbón, a Spanish nobleman, married Julia Méndez y Morales, thereby losing all claims to the Spanish throne.
* A list of morganatic branches of the Russian Imperial Family
* The 1900 marriage of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, whose subsequent assassination triggered World War I, to Countess Sophie Chotek von Wognin was morganatic at the insistence of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I.
* Danish astronomer and nobleman Tycho Brahe married Kirsten Jørgensdatter morganatically in 1572. He was allowed to do so because he was close friends with King Frederick II. The king was sympathetic, as he was unable to marry his love due to class differences.

Royal women who married morganatically:
* Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma (by birth an archduchess of the Imperial House of Habsburg, and by her first marriage a French empress) married morganatically twice after the death of her husband, the emperor Napoleon I. Her second husband was Count Adam Albert von Neipperg. After his death, she married Count Charles-René de Bombelles, her chamberlain, in 1834.
* Queen Maria Christina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, regent of Spain after her husband&#x27;s (Ferdinand VII) death while their daughter, Isabella II, was a minor. She married Agustín Fernando Muñoz y Sánchez, 1st Duke of Riánsares, who was one of her guards in a secret marriage.
* Princess Stéphanie of Belgium, the widow of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria, married Count Elemér Lónyay de Nagy-Lónya et Vásáros-Namény after the death of her first husband. In 1917, Emperor Charles I of Austria conferred upon Lónyay a non-dynastic title of Prince (&quot;Fürst&quot;).

==History==

=== Denmark ===
Succession to the Danish throne followed the specifications of the &quot;Lex Regia&quot; until the Danish Act of Succession was passed in 1953. Prominent morganatic marriages include the 1615 marriage of King Christian IV of Denmark to noblewoman Kirsten Munk. Kirsten was titled &quot;Countess of Schleswig-Holstein&quot; and bore the King 12 children, all styled &quot;Count/Countess of Schleswig-Holstein&quot;. King Frederick VII married the ballerina Louise Rasmussen, who was raised to the rank of &quot;Countess Danner&quot; in 1850. There were no children of this marriage. When Christian IX of Denmark&#x27;s brother, Prince Julius of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glucksburg married Elisabeth von Ziegesar in 1883, the king granted her the title &quot;Countess of Røst&quot;.

Until 1971, Danish princes who married women who did not belong to a royal or noble family were refused the sovereign&#x27;s authorization, renouncing their right of succession to the throne and royal title (Prince Aage of Denmark morganatically eloped with Matilda Calvi, daughter of Count Carlo Giorgio di Bergolo, in January 1914 but renounced his dynastic rights and titles subsequently). They were granted the non-royal prefix of &quot;Prince&quot; and their descendants bear the title Count af Rosenborg in the Danish nobility.

Neither of the children of Queen Margrethe II has married a person of either royal birth or of the titled aristocracy. Members of the Royal Family may still lose their place in the line of succession for themselves and their descendants if they marry without the monarch&#x27;s permission.

=== France ===
Morganatic marriage was not recognized as a concept in French law. Since the law did not distinguish, for marital purposes, between ruler and subjects, marriages between royalty and the noble heiresses to great fiefs became the norm through the 16th century, helping to aggrandize the House of Capet while gradually diminishing the number of large domains held in theoretical vassalage by nobles who were, in practice, virtually independent of the French crown: by the marriage of Catherine de&#x27; Medici to the future King Henry II in 1533, the last of these provinces, the county of Auvergne, came to the crown of France.

Antiquity of nobility in the legitimate male line, not noble quarterings, was the main criterion of rank in the &quot;ancien régime&quot;. Unlike the status of a British peer&#x27;s wife and descendants (yet typical of the nobility of every continental European country), the legitimate children and male-line descendants of any French nobleman (whether titled or not, whether possessing a French peerage or not) were also legally noble &quot;ad infinitum&quot;. Rank was not based on hereditary titles, which were often assumed or acquired by purchase of a noble estate rather than granted by the Crown. Rather, the main determinant of relative rank among the French nobility was how far back the nobility of a family&#x27;s male line could be verifiably traced. Other factors influencing rank included the family&#x27;s history of military command, high-ranking offices held at court and marriages into other high-ranking families. A specific exception was made for bearers of the title of duke who, regardless of their origin, outranked all other nobles. But the ducal title in post-medieval France (even when embellished with the still higher status of &quot;peer&quot;) ranked its holder and his family among France&#x27;s nobility and not, as in Germany and Scandinavia (and, occasionally, Italy, viz. Savoy, Medici, Este, della Rovere, Farnese and Cybo-Malaspina) among Europe&#x27;s reigning dynasties which habitually intermarried with one another.

Once the Bourbons inherited the throne of France from the House of Valois in 1589, their dynasts married daughters of even the oldest ducal families of France — let alone noblewomen of lower rank — quite rarely (viz., Anne de Montafié in 1601, Charlotte Marguerite de Montmorency in 1609 and, in exile from revolutionary France, Maria Caterina Brignole in 1798). Exceptions were made for equal royal intermarriage with the &quot;princes étrangers&quot; and, by royal command, with the so-called &quot;princes légitimés&quot; (i.e., out-of-wedlock but legitimised descendants of Henry IV and Louis XIV), as well as with the nieces of Cardinal-prime ministers (i.e., Richelieu, Mazarin). Just as the French king could authorize a royal marriage that would otherwise have been deemed unsuitable, by 1635 it had been established by Louis XIII that the king could also legally void the canonically valid, equal marriage of a French dynast to which he had not given consent (e.g., Marguerite of Lorraine, Duchess of Orléans).

Moreover, there was a French practice, legally distinct from morganatic marriage but used in similar situations of inequality in status between a member of the royal family and a spouse of lower rank: an &quot;openly secret&quot; marriage. French kings authorized such marriages only when the bride was past child-bearing or the marrying prince already had dynastic heirs by a previous spouse of royal descent. The marriage ceremony took place without banns, in private (with only a priest, the bride and groom, and a few legal witnesses present), and the marriage was never officially acknowledged (although sometimes widely known). Thus, the wife never publicly shared in her husband&#x27;s titles, rank, or coat of arms. The lower-ranked spouse, male or female, could only receive from the royal spouse what property the king allowed.

In secret marriage, Louis XIV wed his second wife, Madame de Maintenon, in 1683 (she was nearly 50, so no children were likely); Louis the Grand Dauphin wed Marie Émilie de Joly de Choin in 1695; Anne Marie d&#x27;Orléans (&quot;La Grande Mademoiselle&quot;) wed Antoine, Duke de Lauzun in 1682; and Louis Philippe I, Duke of Orléans wed the Marquise de Montesson in 1773. The mechanism of the &quot;secret marriage&quot; rendered it unnecessary for France to legislate the morganatic marriage &quot;per se&quot;. Within post-monarchical dynasties, until the end of the 20th century the heads of the Spanish and Italian Bourbon branches, the Orléans of both France and Brazil, and the Imperial Bonapartes have, in exile, exercised claimed authority to exclude from their dynasty descendants born of unapproved marriages — albeit without calling these marriages &quot;morganatic&quot;.

===German-speaking Europe===
The practice of morganatic marriage was most common in the German-speaking parts of Europe, where equality of birth (&quot;Ebenbürtigkeit&quot;) between the spouses was considered an important principle among the reigning houses and high nobility. The German name was &quot;Ehe zur linken Hand&quot; (&quot;marriage by the left hand&quot;) and the husband gave his left hand during the wedding ceremony instead of the right.

Perhaps the most famous example in modern times was the 1900 marriage of the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and Bohemian aristocrat Countess Sophie Chotek von Chotkowa. The marriage was initially resisted by Emperor Franz Joseph I, but after pressure from family members and other European rulers, he relented in 1899 (but did not attend the wedding himself). The bride was made Princess (later Duchess) of Hohenberg, their children took their mother&#x27;s new name and rank, but were excluded from the imperial succession. The Sarajevo assassination in 1914, killing both the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie, triggered the First World War.

Although the issue of morganatic marriages were ineligible to succeed to their families&#x27; respective thrones, children of morganatic marriages have gone on to achieve dynastic success elsewhere in Europe. Descendants of the 1851 marriage of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine to the German-Polish noblewoman Countess Julia von Hauke (created Princess of Battenberg) include Alexander, sovereign prince of Bulgaria, queen-consorts of Spain (Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg) and of Sweden (Louise Mountbatten), and, in the female line, Charles III (through his paternal grandmother, Alice of Battenberg).

Likewise, from the morganatic marriage of Duke Alexander of Württemberg and Countess Claudine Rhédey de Kis-Rhéde (created Countess von Hohenstein) descends Mary of Teck, who became Britain&#x27;s queen in 1911 as the consort of King George V.

Occasionally, children of morganatic marriages have overcome their non-dynastic origins and succeeded to their family&#x27;s realms. Margrave Leopold inherited the throne of Baden, despite being born of a morganatic marriage, after all dynastic males of the House of Zähringen died out. The son of Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden, by his second wife Louise Caroline Geyer von Geyersberg, who belonged to the minor nobility, Leopold became a prince in 1817, at the age of 27, as the result of a new law of succession. Baden&#x27;s grand-ducal family faced extinction, so Leopold was enfranchised by international treaty and married to a princess, ascending the throne in 1830. His descendants ruled the grand duchy until the abolition of the monarchy in 1918.

Other reigning German families adopted similar approaches when facing a lack of male heirs. In 1896 the Princely House of Schwarzburg, with the Sondershausen branch numbering two elderly childless princes and Rudolstadt just one childless prince, recognised Prince Sizzo von Leutenberg, morganatic son of Friedrich Günther, Prince of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, as a Prince of Schwarzburg and heir to the two principalities.

The senior line of the dynasty ruling the Principality of Lippe was bordering on extinction as the 20th century approached, prompting a succession dispute between the Lippe-Biesterfeld and Schaumburg-Lippe branches of the dynasty which evoked international intervention and troop movements. It centered on whether some ancestresses of the Biesterfeld branch had been legally dynastic; if so, that line stood next to inherit the princely crown according to primogeniture. If not, the Biesterfelds would be deemed morganatic and the Schaumburg-Lippes would inherit the throne. Lippe&#x27;s Parliament was blocked from voting on the matter by the German Empire&#x27;s &quot;Reichstag&quot;, which instead created a panel of jurists selected by the King of Saxony to evaluate the evidence concerning the historical marital rules of the House of Lippe and render a decision in the matter, all parties agreeing to abide by their judgment. In 1897 and 1905 panels ruled in favour of the dynasticity of the challenged ancestresses and their descendants, largely because, although neither had been of dynastic rank, the Lippes had historically accepted such marriages for the junior lines when approved by the Head of House.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a few families considered in Germany to be morganatic were considered for crowns elsewhere, constituting unexpected rehabilitation of their status. The first of these was Prince Alexander of Battenberg, who in 1877 was agreed upon by the Great Powers as the best candidate for the new throne of Bulgaria. He was, however, unable to hold onto his crown, and was also unable to obtain the hand in marriage of Princess Viktoria of Prussia despite the efforts of her imperial mother and grandmother.

Wilhelm, Duke of Urach (1864–1928), whose father was the morganatic son of a Württemberg prince, had the distinction of being under consideration for the crowns of five realms at different times: that of the Kingdom of Württemberg in the 1890s, as the senior agnate by primogeniture when it became likely that King William II would die without male descendants, leaving as heir Duke Albrecht of Württemberg, a more distantly related, albeit dynastic, royal kinsman; the Principality of Albania in 1913; the Principality of Monaco at turn of the 20th century, as the next heir by proximity of blood following the Hereditary Prince Louis, until the Monaco succession crisis of 1918 was resolved as the First World War ended; the prospective Grand Duchy of Alsace-Lorraine in 1917; and his abortive election by the &quot;Taryba&quot; as King Mindaugas II of Lithuania in July 1918. In the event, Duke Wilhelm obtained none of these thrones.

Relying upon the &quot;Almanach de Gotha&quot; to gazette dynastic events, Germany&#x27;s deposed heads of state continued to notify its editors of changes in family members&#x27; status and traditional titles. In 1919 the morganatic wife and children of Prince Oskar of Prussia, the counts and countesses von Ruppin, were upgraded to princes and princesses of Prussia by the exiled Kaiser Wilhelm II. In 1928 Georg, Count von Carlow, morganatic son of Duke George Alexander of Mecklenburg and commoner Natalia Vanljarskaya, became a duke of Mecklenburg and heir to his uncle Duke Charles Michael. In 1949, and again in 1999, various morganatic members of the Bavarian Royal House were recognised as princes and princesses of Bavaria, with the current head of the house, Franz von Bayern, being among the beneficiaries of his father&#x27;s ruling, having been born of a marriage initially deemed morganatic.

In the former Royal Family of Saxony Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen adopted and designated as his heir his nephew Alexander Afif, thus bypassing his agnatic cousin&#x27;s morganatic son, Rüdiger von Sachsen, and his three sons.

===Luxembourg===
When the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg found itself without a male heir at the beginning of the 20th century, the morganatic counts von Merenberg proposed themselves as heirs, being the last legitimate descendants in the male line of the House of Nassau. Grand Duke William IV, however, chose to confirm the law of succession stipulated in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna to allow a female descendant in the Nassau male line to become successor to the throne (his own daughter Marie-Adélaïde) instead.

=== Russia ===
Paul I of Russia promulgated a strict new house law for Russia in 1797, eliminating the sovereign&#x27;s right to designate the heir to the throne, but requiring that dynasts be born of authorized marriages. In 1820 a new law also stipulated that only children of Romanovs born of marriages with persons of equal status, i.e., members of a &quot;royal or sovereign family&quot;, could transmit succession rights and titles to descendants. Alexander III forbade Romanov morganatic marriages altogether by issuance of &quot;ukase&quot; #5868 on 24 March 1889 amending article #63 of the Statute on the Imperial Family in the Pauline laws. By &quot;ukase&quot; #35731, dated 11 August 1911, Nicholas II amended the amendment, reducing application of this restriction from all members of the Imperial Family to grand dukes and grand duchesses only. This decree allowed marriages of the princes and princesses of the Blood Imperial with non-royal spouses, on the conditions that the emperor&#x27;s consent be obtained, that the dynast renounce his or her personal succession rights, and that the Pauline laws restricting succession rights to those born of equal marriages continue in force.

An early victim of the Pauline laws was Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich, grandson of Catherine the Great, and viceroy of Poland. On 20 March 1820 his marriage to Princess Juliane of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld was annulled to allow him to morganatically wed his longtime mistress, Countess Joanna Grudna-Grudzińska, in Warsaw on 24 May 1820, who was elevated to the title &quot;Princess Łowicza&quot; upon marriage, which produced no children.

One emperor, Alexander II, married morganatically in 1880. Princess Ekaterina Mihailovna Dolgorukova, Alexander&#x27;s second bride, had previously been his long-term mistress and the mother of his three legitimised children, the princes and princesses Yurievsky.

Beginning a novel tradition, one of that couple&#x27;s daughters, Princess Olga Aleksandrovna Yurievskaya (1873–1925), in 1895 married the child of an 1868 morganatic marriage in the House of Nassau, George, Count von Merenberg (1871–1965). His mother was a daughter of renowned author Alexander Pushkin but, despite being of noble birth, she could not in 1868 dynastically marry the younger brother of a then-exiled Duke of Nassau. The count filed a futile suit to establish that his morganatic status in Germany should not exclude him from succession to the throne of Luxembourg after the last male of the House of Orange, King William III of the Netherlands, died in 1890 and it became apparent that the House of Nassau faced the imminent extinction of its male members, as well, upon the eventual death of Grand Duke William IV. Olga&#x27;s brother, Prince George Aleksandrovich Yurievsky (1872–1913), in 1900 wed Countess Alexandra von Zarnekau (1883–1957), daughter of the morganatic marriage of the Russo-German Duke Constantine Petrovich of Oldenburg with Agrafena Djaparidize. Merenberg&#x27;s sister, Sophia (1868–1927), likewise contracted a morganatic marriage in 1891, with Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich of Russia, whose cousin, Emperor Nicholas II banished them to England, unwittingly saving the couple from the maelstrom of the Russian Revolution which proved fatal to so many Romanovs. She and her children were made &quot;counts de Torby&quot;, her younger daughter, Countess Nada (1896–1963) marrying, in 1916 Prince George of Battenberg, future Marquess of Milford Haven and scion of the House of Battenberg, a morganatic branch of the grandducal House of Hesse which had settled in England and inter-married with descendants of Queen Victoria.

Less fortunate among the Romanovs was Grand Duke Paul Aleksandrovich, who went into exile in Paris to marry a commoner, Olga Valerianovna Karnovich in 1902. Paul returned to serve in the Russian army during the First World War, and Nicholas II rewarded his uncle&#x27;s loyalty by elevating Olga and her children as Princess and Princes Paley in 1915. Paul&#x27;s patriotism, however, sealed his fate, and he died at the hands of Russia&#x27;s revolutionaries in 1919. One of his daughters, Princess Irene Pavlovna Paley (1903–1990), was married while in exile in 1923, to her cousin, Prince Theodor Aleksandrovich of Russia, (1898-1968).

Nicholas II forbade his brother, Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia, from marrying twice-divorced noblewoman Natalya Sergeyevna Wulfert (&quot;née&quot; Sheremetevskaya), but the couple eloped abroad in 1911. The Tsar refused his brother&#x27;s request to grant the bride or their son, George Mikhailovich (1910–1931) a title, but legitimated George and incorporated him into the Russian nobility under the surname &quot;Brassov&quot; in 1915: nonetheless he and his mother used the comital title from 1915, only being granted a princely prefix in exile by Cyril Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia in 1928. In the throes of the First World War, Nicholas II allowed his sister Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia to end her loveless marriage to her social equal, Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, and quietly marry commoner Colonel Nikolai Alexandrovich Kulikovsky. Both Michael&#x27;s and Olga&#x27;s descendants from these marriages were excluded from the succession.

After the murder of Nicholas II and his children, the Imperial Family&#x27;s morganatic marriages restricted the number of possible claimants. Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich, Nicholas&#x27;s cousin, proclaimed himself as Emperor in exile. Controversy accompanied the marriage of his son Grand Duke Vladimir Cyrillovich to Princess Leonida Georgievna Bagration-Mukhransky, a descendant of the deposed Royal House of Georgia. After the annexation of Georgia in 1801, Leonida&#x27;s family were deemed ordinary nobility in Imperial Russia rather than royalty, leading to claims that her 1948 marriage to Vladimir (who, however, also belonged to a deposed dynasty by then) was unequal and should be considered morganatic. As a result, some factions within Russia&#x27;s monarchist movement did not support the couple&#x27;s daughter, Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna, as the rightful heir to the Romanov dynasty.

===Sweden===
The concept of morganatic marriages was never established under Swedish law. The 1810 Act of Succession did, until late 20th century, prohibit princes of the royal house from entering unequal marriages with &quot;enskild mans dotter&quot; (daughter of a private man);i.e. excluding those not belonging to a reigning or mediatised royal house. Those princes that did so anyway lost all rights of succession to the throne themselves, and were no longer considered dynastic members of the royal house; their marriages were never considered morganatic but simply &quot;unequal&quot;.

===Transkei===
Standards of social classification and marital rules resembling the traditions of dynastic Europe can also be found in a number of sovereign nations in Africa. Here, a number of its peoples have legalized traditional authority as manifested in the recognized hereditary transmission of chieftaincy in historically relevant regions of the continent (e.g., the Asantehene of Ghana).

An example of the form that morganatic unions tend to take amongst African royalty can be found in the biography of Nelson Mandela, the late leader of South Africa. Mandela, a nobleman by birth of the Xhosa Thembus that reside in the Transkei region of the Cape coast, was nevertheless unable to ascend the throne of the &quot;Kumkani&quot; (or king) of the entire Thembu tribe, even though he descended in the legitimate, male line from the holders of this title. Nearly two centuries ago, Ngubengcuka (d. 1832), who ruled as the &quot;Kumkani&quot; of the Thembu people, married and subsequently left a son named Mandela, who became Nelson&#x27;s grandfather and the source of his surname. However, because Mandela was only the Inkosi&#x27;s child by a wife of the &quot;Ixhiba&quot; lineage, a so-called &quot;Left-Hand House&quot;, the descendants of his cadet branch of the Thembu royal family remain ineligible to succeed to the Thembu throne, which is itself one of the several traditional seats that are still officially recognized by South Africa&#x27;s government. Instead, the Mandelas were given the chiefdom of Mvezo and made hereditary counsellors to the &quot;Kumkani&quot; (i.e., privy counsellors) in deference to their royal ancestry. Following the loss of this chiefdom (which has since been restored to the family) in the Apartheid era, the Mandelas retained their positions as nobles of the Transkei. This status entailed, however, a degree of subjugation to the head of the dynasty, in particular in the matter of marital selection, which proved so onerous an issue to Nelson Mandela that it prompted the departure to Johannesburg that eventually led to his political career. Like the House of Battenberg in Europe, Mandela&#x27;s family has since rehabilitated its dynastic status to some extent: Mandela was still in prison when his daughter Zenani was married to Prince Thumbumuzi Dlamini in 1973, elder brother of both King Mswati III of Swaziland and Queen Mantfombi, Great Wife of Goodwill Zwelithini, King of the Zulus.

=== Travancore and Cochin ===
In the erstwhile princely state of Travancore, in India, the male members of the Travancore Royal Family were, under the existing matrilineal Marumakkathayam system of inheritance and family, permitted to contract marriages with women of the Nair caste only. These were morganatic marriages called Sambandhams wherein the children gained their mother&#x27;s caste and family name, due to Marumakkathayam. Although they could not inherit the throne, they did receive a title of nobility, Thampi (son of the Maharajah) and Kochamma (daughter of the Maharajah). These were the members of the Ammaveedus and their titles ensured a comfortable lifestyle and all other luxuries. The descendants of these Ammaveedu members were simply called Thampi and Thankachi and they didn&#x27;t get any other distinguishing privileges.

The Cochin Royal family also followed the system of Marumakkatayam. Traditionally the female members of the family married Namboodiri Brahmins while male members marry ladies of the Nair caste. These wives of the male members are not royalty or didn&#x27;t receive any royal titles or power, per the matrilineal system but instead get the title of Nethyar Amma. Their position ceases when the Maharaja dies. The children born to Neytharammas will be known by their mother&#x27;s caste and hold no key royal titles. Currently the family marries mostly within the Kerala Kshatriya class.

=== United Kingdom ===

The concept of morganatic marriage has never clearly existed in any part of the United Kingdom, and historically the English crown descended through marriages with commoners as late as the 17th century. Only two of the six marriages Henry VIII made to secure an heir were with royal brides, and Elizabeth Woodville, queen of Edward IV of England, was also a commoner.

Another link in the English succession involving marriage with a commoner was between John of Gaunt and Katherine Swynford. When they married after co-habiting for several years all children born previously were subsequently legitimated by Act of Parliament. King Henry IV later declared that they could not inherit the crown, but it is not clear that he had the right to do this. This marriage was important, as King Henry VII was descended from it, but Parliament still declared that he was king, so some issues remained unresolved.

The marriage of George IV as Prince of Wales to Maria Fitzherbert in 1785 is frequently referred to as morganatic: it was in fact doubly in breach of law, as a marriage to a Catholic and one not having been sanctioned by the king.

As in nearly all European monarchies extant in the 21st century, most approved marriages in the British royal family are with untitled commoners and have been for several generations. In 1923, the future George VI (then second in line to the throne as Duke of York), was the first future British monarch to marry a non-princess or prince since 1659 when the future James VII &amp; II eloped with Anne Hyde. Wives of British peers are entitled to use the feminine form of their husbands&#x27; peerages under English common law, while wives of royal princes share their husbands&#x27; styles by custom unless the Sovereign formally objects.

For example, Catherine Middleton, a commoner, became the Duchess of Cambridge upon her marriage on 29 April 2011 to Prince William, who had been created Duke of Cambridge that morning. Camilla Parker Bowles, second wife of Charles, Prince of Wales (as he was at the time), legally held the title &quot;Princess of Wales&quot; but at the time that the engagement was announced it was declared that she would be known by the title &quot;Duchess of Cornwall&quot; and, in Scotland, Duchess of Rothesay (derived from other titles her husband held as heir apparent) in deference, it has been reported, to public feelings about the title&#x27;s previous holder, the Prince&#x27;s first wife Lady Diana Spencer. It was simultaneously stated that at such time, if any, her husband acceded to the throne, she would be known as &quot;Princess Consort&quot; rather than &quot;Queen&quot;, although as the king&#x27;s wife she would legally be queen. However, in her 2022 Accession Day message, Queen Elizabeth II stated that it was her &quot;sincere wish&quot; for Camilla to be &quot;known as Queen Consort&quot;, and, on Charles&#x27; accession, Camilla took this title.

==== Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson ====

On 16 November 1936 Edward VIII informed Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin that he intended to marry the American divorcée Wallis Simpson, proposing that he be allowed to do so morganatically and remain king. Baldwin expressed his belief that Mrs. Simpson would be unacceptable to the British people as queen due to her status as a divorcee, which contradicted Church of England doctrine at the time, but agreed to take further soundings. The prospect of the marriage was rejected by the British Cabinet. The other Dominion governments were consulted pursuant to the Statute of Westminster 1931, which provided in part that &quot;any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and Titles shall hereafter require the assent as well of the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.&quot; Baldwin suggested three options to the prime ministers of the five Dominions of which Edward was also king: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the Irish Free State. The options were:

# Edward and Mrs. Simpson marry and she become queen (a royal marriage);
# Edward and Mrs. Simpson marry, but she not become queen, instead receiving some courtesy title (a morganatic marriage); or
# Abdication for Edward and any potential heirs he might father, allowing him to make any marital decisions without further constitutional implications.

The second option had European precedents, including Edward&#x27;s own maternal great-grandfather, Duke Alexander of Württemberg, but no unambiguous parallel in British constitutional history. William Lyon Mackenzie King (Prime Minister of Canada), Joseph Lyons (Prime Minister of Australia) and J. B. M. Hertzog (Prime Minister of South Africa) opposed options 1 and 2. Michael Joseph Savage (Prime Minister of New Zealand) rejected option 1 but thought that option 2 &quot;might be possible ... if some solution along these lines were found to be practicable&quot; but &quot;would be guided by the decision of the Home government&quot;. Thus the majority of the Commonwealth&#x27;s prime ministers agreed that there was &quot;no alternative to course (3)&quot;. On 24 November, Baldwin consulted the three leading opposition politicians in Britain: Leader of the Opposition Clement Attlee, Liberal leader Sir Archibald Sinclair and Winston Churchill. Sinclair and Attlee agreed that options 1 and 2 were unacceptable and Churchill pledged to support the government.

The letters and diaries of working-class people and ex-servicemen generally demonstrate support for the King, while those from the middle and upper classes tend to express indignation and distaste. &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Morning Post&quot;, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, and newspapers owned by Lord Kemsley, such as &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, opposed the marriage. On the other hand, the &quot;Express&quot; and &quot;Mail&quot; newspapers, owned by Lord Beaverbrook and Lord Rothermere, respectively, appeared to support a morganatic marriage. The King estimated that the newspapers in favour had a circulation of 12.5 million, and those against had 8.5 million.

Backed by Churchill and Beaverbrook, Edward proposed to broadcast a speech indicating his desire to remain on the throne or to be recalled to it if forced to abdicate, while marrying Mrs Simpson morganatically. In one section, Edward proposed to say:
Baldwin and the British Cabinet blocked the speech, saying that it would shock many people and would be a grave breach of constitutional principles.

Ultimately, Edward decided to give up the throne for &quot;the woman I love&quot;, whereupon he and his descendants were deprived of all right to the Crown by Parliament&#x27;s passage of His Majesty&#x27;s Declaration of Abdication Act 1936. He was created Duke of Windsor on 8 March 1937 by his brother, the new George VI. He would marry Wallis Simpson in France on 3 June 1937, after her second divorce became final. In the meantime, however, letters patent dated 27 May 1937, which re-conferred upon the Duke of Windsor the &quot;title, style, or attribute of Royal Highness&quot;, specifically stated that &quot;his wife and descendants, if any, shall not hold said title or attribute&quot;. This decree was issued by the new king and unanimously supported by the Dominion governments. The king&#x27;s authority to withhold from the lawful wife of a prince the attribute hitherto accorded to the wives of other modern British princes was addressed by the Crown&#x27;s legal authorities: On 14 April 1937, Attorney General Sir Donald Somervell submitted to Home Secretary Sir John Simon a memorandum summarising the views of Lord Advocate T. M. Cooper, Parliamentary Counsel Sir Granville Ram, and himself:

#We incline to the view that on his abdication the Duke of Windsor could not have claimed the right to be described as a Royal Highness. In other words, no reasonable objection could have been taken if the King had decided that his exclusion from the lineal succession excluded him from the right to this title as conferred by the existing Letters Patent.
#The question however has to be considered on the basis of the fact that, for reasons which are readily understandable, he with the express approval of His Majesty enjoys this title and has been referred to as a Royal Highness on a formal occasion and in formal documents. In the light of precedent it seems clear that the wife of a Royal Highness enjoys the same title unless some appropriate express step can be and is taken to deprive her of it.
#We came to the conclusion that the wife could not claim this right on any legal basis. The right to use this style or title, in our view, is within the prerogative of His Majesty and he has the power to regulate it by Letters Patent generally or in particular circumstances.
The new King&#x27;s firm view, that the Duchess should not be given a royal title, was shared by Queen Mary and George&#x27;s wife, Queen Elizabeth. The Duchess bitterly resented the denial of the royal title and the refusal of the Duke&#x27;s relatives to accept her as part of the family. In the early days of George VI&#x27;s reign the Duke telephoned daily, importuning for money and urging that the Duchess be granted the style of Royal Highness, until the harassed King ordered that the calls not be put through. However, within the household of the Duke and Duchess, the style &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; was used by those who were close to the couple.

==== Morganatic vs. invalid ====

The Royal Marriages Act 1772 made it illegal for all persons born into the British royal family to marry without the permission of the sovereign, and any marriage contracted without the sovereign&#x27;s consent was considered invalid. This led to several prominent cases of British princes who had gone through marriage ceremonies, and who cohabited with their partners as if married, but whose relationships were not legally recognised. As a result, their partners and children (which would be considered illegitimate) held no titles, and had no succession rights. This differs from morganatic marriages, which are considered legally valid.

===England/Scotland===
==== James II/VII and Anne Hyde ====

It has been suggested that William, Prince of Orange, expected to have a strong claim to the throne of England after the Duke of York during the reign of Charles II. In fact, the Duke&#x27;s two daughters from his first marriage, Princess Mary and Princess Anne, were considered to have the stronger claim by the English establishment. William&#x27;s expectation was based on the continental practice of morganatic marriage, since the mother of both princesses, Anne Hyde, was a commoner and a lady-in-waiting to William&#x27;s mother, Princess Mary. It was through his mother, a sister of Charles II and the Duke of York, that William claimed the throne, because, to his mind, the son of a princess had a stronger claim than the daughter of a commoner. It was to shore up his own claim to the throne that he agreed to marry his first cousin, Princess Mary. When James II fled at the Glorious Revolution, William refused to accept the title of king consort (which Philip II of Spain had been granted under Queen Mary I in the 1550s) and insisted on being named King in his own right. The compromise solution involved naming both to the crown as had rarely happened in the past (see for example King Henry II and his son Young King Henry, who ruled England simultaneously).

<text>Alice in Chains (often abbreviated as AIC) is an American rock band formed in Seattle in 1987. Since 2006, the band&#x27;s lineup has comprised vocalist/guitarists Jerry Cantrell and William DuVall, bassist Mike Inez and drummer Sean Kinney. Vocalist Layne Staley and bassist Mike Starr are former members of the band. The band took its name from Staley&#x27;s previous band, Alice N&#x27; Chains. Often associated with grunge music, Alice in Chains&#x27; sound and style is deeply rooted in heavy metal. The band is known for its distinctive vocal style, which often included the harmonized vocals between Staley and Cantrell (and later Cantrell and DuVall).

Alice in Chains rose to international fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, along with other Seattle bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. They achieved success during the era with the albums &quot;Facelift&quot; (1990), &quot;Dirt&quot; (1992) and &quot;Alice in Chains&quot; (1995), as well as the extended play &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; (1994). The band was plagued by extended inactivity from 1996 onward, largely due to Staley&#x27;s substance abuse, which resulted in his death in 2002 and caused the band to go on hiatus. Alice in Chains regrouped in 2005, with DuVall joining in 2006 as rhythm guitarist and sharing lead vocal duties; the band has since released three more albums: &quot;Black Gives Way to Blue&quot; (2009), &quot;The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here&quot; (2013) and &quot;Rainier Fog&quot; (2018).

Since its formation, Alice in Chains has released six studio albums, three EPs, three live albums, four compilations, two DVDs, 43 music videos and 32 singles. The band has sold more than 30 million records worldwide, and over 20 million records in the US alone. It has had 18 Top 10 songs on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and 5 No. 1 hits, and has received eleven Grammy Award nominations. The band was ranked number 34 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot; special and as the 15th greatest live band by &quot;Hit Parader&quot;.

==History==
===1984–1989: Formation and early years===

Before the formation of Alice in Chains, Layne Staley, a drummer at the time, landed his first gig as a vocalist when he auditioned to sing for a local glam metal band known as Sleze after receiving some encouragement from his stepbrother Ken Elmer. Other members of this group at that time were guitarists Johnny Bacolas and Zoli Semanate, drummer James Bergstrom, and bassist Byron Hansen.

This band went through several lineup changes culminating with Nick Pollock as their sole guitarist and Bacolas switching to bass before discussions arose about changing their name to &quot;Alice in Chains&quot;. This was prompted by a conversation that Bacolas had with Russ Klatt, the lead singer of Slaughter Haus 5, about backstage passes. One of the passes said &quot;Welcome to Wonderland&quot;, and they started talking about that being a reference to Alice in Wonderland, until Klatt said, &quot;What about Alice in Chains? Put her in bondage and stuff like that.&quot;

Bacolas liked the name &quot;Alice in Chains&quot; and brought it up to his bandmates; they agreed and decided to change the band&#x27;s name. Due to concerns over the reference to female bondage, the group ultimately chose to spell it differently as Alice N&#x27; Chains to allay any parental concerns, though Staley&#x27;s mother Nancy McCallum has said she was still not happy with this name at first. According to Bacolas, the decision to use the apostrophe-N combination in their name had nothing to do with the band Guns N&#x27; Roses. The name change happened a year before Guns N&#x27; Roses became a household name with their first album, &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;, released in July 1987.

Staley met guitarist Jerry Cantrell at a party in Seattle around August 1987. A few months prior, Cantrell had watched a concert of Alice N&#x27; Chains in his hometown at the Tacoma Little Theatre, and was impressed by Staley&#x27;s voice. Cantrell was homeless after being kicked out of his family&#x27;s house, so Staley invited Cantrell to live with him at the rehearsal studio Music Bank.

Alice N&#x27; Chains soon disbanded, and Staley joined a funk band. Cantrell&#x27;s band, Diamond Lie, broke up and he wanted to form a new band, so Staley gave him the phone number of Melinda Starr, the girlfriend of drummer Sean Kinney, so that Cantrell could set up a meeting with Kinney. Kinney and his girlfriend went to the Music Bank and listened to Cantrell&#x27;s demos, who mentioned that they needed a bass player to jam with them, and he had someone in mind: Mike Starr, with whom Cantrell had played in a band in Burien called Gypsy Rose. Kinney mentioned that his girlfriend was actually Mike Starr&#x27;s sister, and that he had been playing in bands together with Starr since they were kids. Kinney called Starr and a few days later he started jamming with him and Cantrell at the Music Bank.

Staley&#x27;s funk band also required a guitarist at the time, and Staley asked Cantrell to join as a sideman. Cantrell agreed on condition that Staley join his band. Because Cantrell, Starr and Kinney wanted Staley to be their lead singer, they started auditioning terrible lead singers in front of Staley to send a hint. When they auditioned a male stripper, Staley decided to join the band. Eventually the funk project broke up, and in 1987 Staley joined Cantrell&#x27;s band on a full-time basis. Two weeks after the band&#x27;s formation, they were playing a gig at Washington State University, trying to fill in a 40-minute set with a couple of original songs along with Hanoi Rocks and David Bowie covers.

The band played a couple of gigs in clubs around the Pacific Northwest, calling themselves different monikers, including Diamond Lie, the name of Cantrell&#x27;s previous band, and &quot;Fuck&quot;, before eventually adopting the name that Staley&#x27;s previous band had initially flirted with, &quot;Alice in Chains&quot;. Staley contacted his former bandmates and asked for permission to use the name. Nick Pollock was not particularly thrilled about it at the time, and thought he should come up with a different name; both he and James Bergstrom ultimately gave Staley their blessing to use the name.
Local promoter Randy Hauser became aware of the band at a concert and offered to pay for demo recordings. However, one day before the band was due to record at the Music Bank studio in Washington, police shut down the studio during the biggest cannabis raid in the history of the state. The final demo, completed in 1988, was named &quot;The Treehouse Tapes&quot; and found its way to music managers Kelly Curtis and Susan Silver, who also managed the Seattle-based band Soundgarden. Curtis and Silver passed the demo on to Columbia Records&#x27; A&amp;R representative Nick Terzo, who set up an appointment with label president Don Ienner. Based on &quot;The Treehouse Tapes&quot;, Terzo signed Alice in Chains to Columbia in 1989.

===1990–1992: &quot;Facelift&quot; and &quot;Sap&quot;===
Alice in Chains soon became a top priority of the label, which released the band&#x27;s first official recording in July 1990, a promotional EP called &quot;We Die Young&quot;. The EP&#x27;s lead single, &quot;We Die Young&quot;, became a hit on metal radio. After its success, the label rushed Alice in Chains&#x27; debut album into production with producer Dave Jerden. Cantrell stated the album was intended to have a &quot;moody aura&quot; that was a &quot;direct result of the brooding atmosphere and feel of Seattle.&quot;

The resulting album, &quot;Facelift&quot;, was released on August 21, 1990, peaking at number 42 in the summer of 1991 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. &quot;Facelift&quot; was not an instant success, selling under 40,000 copies in the first six months of release, until MTV added &quot;Man in the Box&quot; to regular daytime rotation. The single hit number 18 on the Mainstream rock charts, with the album&#x27;s follow up single, &quot;Sea of Sorrow&quot;, reaching number 27, and in six weeks &quot;Facelift&quot; sold 400,000 copies in the US. The album was a critical success, with Steve Huey of AllMusic citing &quot;Facelift&quot; as &quot;one of the most important records in establishing an audience for grunge and alternative rock among hard rock and heavy metal listeners.&quot; Sammy Hagar claimed he invited the band to tour with Van Halen after he saw the music video for &quot;Man In The Box&quot; on MTV.

&quot;Facelift&quot; was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling a half-million copies on September 11, 1991, becoming the first album from Seattle&#x27;s Grunge movement to be certified gold. The band continued to hone its audience, opening for such artists as Iggy Pop, Van Halen, Poison, and Extreme. &quot;Facelift&quot; has since been certified triple-platinum by the RIAA, for shipments of three million copies in the United States.

The concert at the Moore Theatre in Seattle on December 22, 1990, was recorded and released on VHS on July 30, 1991, as &quot;Live Facelift&quot;. It features five live songs and three music videos. The home video has been certified gold by the RIAA for sales exceeding 50,000 copies.

In early 1991, Alice in Chains landed the opening slot for the Clash of the Titans tour with Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer, exposing the band to a wide metal audience but receiving mainly poor reception. Alice in Chains was nominated for a Best Hard Rock Performance Grammy Award in 1992 for &quot;Man in the Box&quot;.

Following the tour, Alice in Chains entered the studio to record demos for its next album, but ended up recording five acoustic songs instead. While in the studio, drummer Sean Kinney had a dream about &quot;making an EP called &quot;Sap&quot;&quot;. The band decided &quot;not to mess with fate&quot;, and on February 4, 1992, Alice in Chains released their second EP, &quot;Sap&quot;. The EP was released while Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; was at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts, resulting in a rising popularity of Seattle-based bands, and of the term &quot;grunge music&quot;. &quot;Sap&quot; was certified gold within two weeks. The EP features Cantrell on lead vocals on the opening track, &quot;Brother&quot;, and guest vocals by Ann Wilson from the band Heart, who joined Staley and Cantrell for the choruses of &quot;Brother&quot; and &quot;Am I Inside&quot;. The EP also features Mark Arm of Mudhoney and Chris Cornell of Soundgarden, who shared vocals with Staley and Cantrell on the song &quot;Right Turn&quot;, credited to &quot;Alice Mudgarden&quot; in the liner notes.

In 1992, Alice in Chains appeared in the Cameron Crowe film &quot;Singles&quot;, performing as a &quot;bar band&quot;. The band also contributed the song &quot;Would?&quot; to the film&#x27;s , whose video received an award for Best Video from a Film at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards.
===1992–1993: &quot;Dirt&quot;===
In March 1992, the band returned to the studio. With new songs written primarily on the road, the material has an overall darker feel than &quot;Facelift&quot;, with six of the album&#x27;s thirteen songs dealing with the subject of addiction. &quot;We did a lot of soul searching on this album. There&#x27;s a lot of intense feelings.&quot; Cantrell said, &quot;We deal with our daily demons through music. All of the poison that builds up during the day we cleanse when we play.&quot; On September 29, 1992, Alice in Chains released its second album, &quot;Dirt&quot;. The album peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and since its release has been certified 5× platinum by the RIAA, making &quot;Dirt&quot; the band&#x27;s highest selling album to date. The album was a critical success, with Huey praising the album as a &quot;major artistic statement, and the closest they ever came to recording a flat-out masterpiece.&quot; Chris Gill of &quot;Guitar World&quot; called &quot;Dirt&quot; &quot;huge and foreboding, yet eerie and intimate&quot;, and &quot;sublimely dark and brutally honest.&quot;

&quot;Dirt&quot; spawned five singles that reached the top 30 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart: &quot;Would?&quot;, &quot;Rooster&quot;, &quot;Them Bones&quot;, &quot;Angry Chair&quot;, and &quot;Down in a Hole&quot;, and remained on the charts for nearly two years. Alice in Chains was added as openers to Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s &quot;No More Tours&quot; tour. Days before the tour began, Layne Staley broke his foot in an ATV accident, forcing him to use crutches on stage.

Starr left the band after the release of &quot;Dirt&quot;. Staley told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1994 about Starr leaving the band, &quot;It was just a difference in priorities. We wanted to continue intense touring and press. Mike was ready to go home.&quot; Years later, Starr claimed that he was fired due to his drug addiction.

Starr was replaced by former Ozzy Osbourne bassist Mike Inez. Inez had met Alice in Chains during Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s &quot;No More Tours&quot; tour and became friends with them. When the band was in Brazil, they called Inez to join them and he accepted. Inez wanted to do the shows in Brazil and even got his immunization shots, but the band called him back telling that Starr wanted to do the last two shows in Brazil, so they would meet Inez in London instead. Inez ended up getting sick with his vaccination shots for a couple of days. Inez played his first concert with Alice in Chains on January 27, 1993, at the Camden Underworld in London.

In April 1993, the band recorded two songs with Inez, &quot;What the Hell Have I&quot; and &quot;A Little Bitter&quot;, for the &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; soundtrack. During the summer of 1993, Alice in Chains toured with the alternative music festival Lollapalooza, their last major tour with Staley.

===1993–1994: &quot;Jar of Flies&quot;===

Following Alice in Chains&#x27; extensive 1993 world tour, Staley said the band &quot;just wanted to go into the studio for a few days with our acoustic guitars and see what happened.&quot; &quot;We never really planned on the music we made at that time to be released. But the record label heard it and they really liked it. For us, it was just the experience of four guys getting together in the studio and making some music.&quot;

Columbia Records released Alice in Chains&#x27; second acoustic-based EP, &quot;Jar of Flies&quot;, on January 25, 1994. Written and recorded in one week, &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming the first EP—and first Alice in Chains release—to top the charts.

Paul Evans of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the EP &quot;darkly gorgeous&quot;, and Steve Huey said, &quot;&#x27;Jar of Flies&#x27; is a low-key stunner, achingly gorgeous and harrowingly sorrowful all at once.&quot; &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; features Alice in Chains&#x27; first number-one single on the Mainstream Rock charts, &quot;No Excuses&quot;. The second single, &quot;I Stay Away&quot;, reached number ten on the Mainstream rock charts, while the final single &quot;Don&#x27;t Follow&quot;, reached number 25. &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; has been certified triple platinum by the RIAA, with over 2 million copies sold in the United States during its first year. &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; received two Grammy nominations, Best Hard Rock Performance for &quot;I Stay Away&quot;, and Best Recording Package.

After the release of &quot;Jar of Flies&quot;, Staley entered rehab for heroin addiction. The band was scheduled to tour during the summer of 1994 with Metallica, Suicidal Tendencies, Danzig, and Fight, as well as a slot during Woodstock &#x27;94, but while in rehearsal for the tour, Staley began using heroin again. Staley&#x27;s condition prompted the other band members to cancel all scheduled dates one day before the start of the tour, putting the band on hiatus. Alice in Chains was replaced by Candlebox on the tour. Susan Silver&#x27;s management office sent out a statement saying that the decision to withdraw from the Metallica tour and Woodstock was &quot;due to health problems within the band.&quot; Shortly after withdrawing, the band broke up for six months, with Kinney telling &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1996, &quot;Nobody was being honest with each other back then. If we had kept going, there was a good chance we would have self-destructed on the road, and we definitely didn&#x27;t want that to happen in public.&quot;

===1995–1996: &quot;Alice in Chains&quot;===
While Alice in Chains was inactive during 1995, Staley joined the &quot;grunge supergroup&quot; Mad Season, which also featured Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready, bassist John Baker Saunders from The Walkabouts, and Screaming Trees drummer Barrett Martin. Mad Season released one album, &quot;Above&quot;, for which Staley provided lead vocals and the album artwork. The album spawned a number two Mainstream Rock chart single, &quot;River of Deceit&quot;, and a home video release of &quot;Live at the Moore&quot;.

In April 1995, Alice in Chains entered Bad Animals Studio in Seattle with producer Toby Wright, who had previously worked with Corrosion of Conformity and Slayer. While in the studio, an inferior version of the song &quot;Grind&quot; was leaked to radio, and received major airplay. On October 6, the band released the studio version of the song to radio via satellite uplink to stem the excessive spread of taped copies of the song. On November 7, 1995, Columbia Records released their self-titled album, &quot;Alice in Chains&quot;, which debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and has since been certified triple platinum. Of the album&#x27;s four singles, &quot;Grind&quot;, &quot;Again&quot;, &quot;Over Now&quot;, and &quot;Heaven Beside You&quot;, three feature Cantrell on lead vocals. Jon Wiederhorn of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;liberating and enlightening, the songs achieve a startling, staggering and palpable impact.&quot; The band released the home video &quot;The Nona Tapes&quot; On December 12, a mockumentary featuring interviews with the band members conducted by journalist Nona Weisbaum (played by Jerry Cantrell), and the music video for &quot;Grind&quot;. The band opted not to tour in support of &quot;Alice in Chains&quot;, adding to the rumors of drug abuse.

The song &quot;Got Me Wrong&quot; unexpectedly charted three years after its release on the &quot;Sap&quot; EP. The song was re-released as a single on the soundtrack for the film &quot;Clerks&quot; in 1994, reaching number seven on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

Alice in Chains resurfaced on April 10, 1996, to perform for &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, a program featuring all-acoustic set lists. The performance featured some of the band&#x27;s highest-charting singles, including &quot;Rooster&quot;, &quot;Down in a Hole&quot;, &quot;Heaven Beside You&quot;, &quot;No Excuses&quot; and &quot;Would?&quot;, and introduced a new song, &quot;Killer Is Me&quot;, with Cantrell on lead vocals. The show marked Alice in Chains&#x27; only appearance as a five-piece band, adding second guitarist Scott Olson. A live album of the performance was released in July 1996, which debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was accompanied by a home video release, both of which received platinum certification by the RIAA. The band also appeared on &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on May 10, 1996, performing the songs &quot;Again&quot; and &quot;We Die Young&quot;. Alice in Chains performed four shows supporting the reunited original Kiss lineup on their 1996–97 Alive/Worldwide Tour, including the final live appearance of Layne Staley on July 3, 1996, in Kansas City, Missouri. Shortly after the show, Staley was found unresponsive after he overdosed on heroin and was taken to the hospital. Although he recovered, the band was forced to go on hiatus.

===1996–2004: Hiatus, side projects and death of Layne Staley===
Although Alice in Chains never officially disbanded, Staley became a recluse, rarely leaving his Seattle condominium following the death of his ex-fiancée Demri Parrott on October 29, 1996. &quot;Drugs worked for me for years,&quot; Staley told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in February 1996, &quot;and now they&#x27;re turning against me ... now I&#x27;m walking through hell and this sucks. I didn&#x27;t want my fans to think that heroin was cool. But then I&#x27;ve had fans come up to me and give me the thumbs up, telling me they&#x27;re high. That&#x27;s exactly what I didn&#x27;t want to happen.&quot;

Unable to continue with new Alice in Chains material, Cantrell released his first solo album, &quot;Boggy Depot&quot;, in 1998, also featuring Sean Kinney and Mike Inez. Cantrell and Kinney were also featured on Metallica&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Garage Inc.&quot;, both were guest musicians in the track &quot;Tuesday&#x27;s Gone&quot;, a Lynyrd Skynyrd cover. In October 1998, Staley reunited with Alice in Chains to record two new songs, &quot;Get Born Again&quot; and &quot;Died&quot;. Originally intended for Cantrell&#x27;s second solo album, the songs were reworked by Alice in Chains and were released in the fall of 1999 on a box set, &quot;Music Bank&quot;. The set contains 48 songs, including rarities, demos, and previously released album tracks and singles. The band also released a 15-track compilation titled &quot;Nothing Safe: Best of the Box&quot;, serving as a sampler for &quot;Music Bank&quot;, as well as the band&#x27;s first compilation album; a live album, simply titled &quot;Live&quot;, released on December 5, 2000; and a second compilation, titled &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; in 2001.

In November 1998, Layne Staley recorded a cover of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot; with the supergroup Class of &#x27;99. The song was featured on the soundtrack to the 1998 horror/sci-fi film, &quot;The Faculty&quot;.

After they toured as part of Cantrell&#x27;s solo band in 1998, Sean Kinney and Queensrÿche guitarist Chris DeGarmo formed a new band called Spys4Darwin. Mike Inez and Sponge lead vocalist Vin Dombroski joined the supergroup soon after. The band released their first and only album in 2001, a 6-track EP entitled &quot;Microfish&quot;. In June 2001, Mike Inez joined Zakk Wylde&#x27;s Black Label Society for the remaining dates of Ozzfest, following the departure of bassist Steve Gibb for medical reasons. Inez joined the band again for their West Coast and Japanese tour in 2003.

By 2002, Cantrell had finished work on his second solo album, &quot;Degradation Trip&quot;. Written in 1998, the album&#x27;s lyrical content focused heavily on what Cantrell regarded as the demise of Alice in Chains, which still remained evident as the album approached its June 2002 release. However, in March that year, Cantrell commented, &quot;We&#x27;re all still around, so it&#x27;s possible [Alice in Chains] could all do something someday, and I fully hope someday we will.&quot;

Reflecting on the band&#x27;s hiatus in a 2011 interview, Kinney said that Staley wasn&#x27;t the only one battling addiction. He was the focal point, like singers are. So they&#x27;d single him out. But the truth was, it was pretty much everybody. I definitely had my hand firmly on the wheel going off the cliff. And the reason we pulled back – you know when you stop when you have two #1 records, it&#x27;s not really the greatest career move – but we did that because we love each other and we didn&#x27;t want to die in public. And I know for a fact in my heart that if we were to continue that I wouldn&#x27;t be on the phone right now talking to you. I wouldn&#x27;t have made it. I just wouldn&#x27;t have.

After a decade of battling drug addiction, Layne Staley was found dead in his condominium on April 19, 2002. The autopsy and toxicology report revealed that he died from a mixture of heroin and cocaine, known as &quot;speedball&quot;. The autopsy concluded that Staley died on April 5, two weeks before his body was found. Cantrell dedicated his 2002 solo album, &quot;Degradation Trip&quot;, released two months after Staley&#x27;s death, to his memory. Mike Starr later claimed on &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot; that he was the last person to see Staley alive, and admitted to feeling guilty about not calling 911 after Staley had warned him against it. &quot;I wish I hadn&#x27;t been high on benzodiazepine [that night], I wouldn&#x27;t have just walked out the door,&quot; Starr said.

Following Staley&#x27;s death, Mike Inez joined Heart and toured and recorded with the band from 2002 through 2006. Jerry Cantrell collaborated with several artists such as Heart, Ozzy Osbourne, and Damageplan. In 2004, Cantrell formed the band Cardboard Vampyres along with The Cult guitarist Billy Duffy, Mötley Crüe vocalist and Ratt guitarist John Corabi, The Cult bassist Chris Wyse and drummer Josh Howser. On October 22, 2004, Sony BMG terminated their contract with Alice in Chains, 15 years after the band signed with the label, in 1989.

===2005–2008: Reunion shows and reformation===
In 2005, Sean Kinney came up with the idea of doing a benefit concert for the victims of the tsunami disaster that struck South Asia in 2004. Kinney made calls to his former bandmates, as well as friends in the music community, such as former Alice in Chains manager Susan Silver. Kinney was surprised by the enthusiastic response to his idea. On February 18, 2005, Jerry Cantrell, Mike Inez, and Sean Kinney reunited to perform for the first time in nine years at &quot;K-Rock Tsunami Continued Care Relief Concert&quot; in Seattle. The band featured Damageplan vocalist Pat Lachman, as well as other special guests including Maynard James Keenan of Tool and Ann Wilson of Heart. A few months after that experience, the band called Susan Silver and Cantrell&#x27;s manager Bill Siddons and said they wanted to tour as Alice in Chains again. Alice in Chains was approached by the producers of the CBS reality show &quot;Rock Star&quot; about being featured on its second season, but the band turned the offer down. In the show, aspiring singers competed to become the lead vocalist of a featured group.

On March 10, 2006, the surviving members performed at VH1&#x27;s Decades Rock Live concert, honoring fellow Seattle musicians Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart. They played &quot;Would?&quot; with vocalist Phil Anselmo of Pantera and Down and bass player Duff McKagan of Guns N&#x27; Roses and Velvet Revolver, and at the end of the performance Cantrell dedicated the show to Layne Staley and the late Pantera and Damageplan guitarist Dimebag Darrell. They also played &quot;Rooster&quot; with Comes with the Fall vocalist William DuVall and Ann Wilson. The band followed the concert with a short United States club tour named &quot;Finish What We Started&quot;, several festival dates in Europe, and a brief tour in Japan. Duff McKagan again joined the band for the reunion tour, playing rhythm guitar on selected songs. During the tour, the band played a 5-minute video tribute to Staley during the changeover from the electric to acoustic set.

To coincide with the band&#x27;s reunion, Sony Music released the long-delayed third Alice in Chains compilation, &quot;The Essential Alice in Chains&quot;, a double album that includes 28 songs.

Jerry Cantrell met William DuVall in Los Angeles in 2000 through a mutual acquaintance who introduced Cantrell to Comes with the Fall&#x27;s first album. Cantrell started hanging out with the band and occasionally joined them onstage. Between 2001 and 2002, Comes with the Fall was both the opening act on Cantrell&#x27;s tour for his second solo album, &quot;Degradation Trip&quot;, and also his backing band, with DuVall singing Staley&#x27;s parts at the concerts. DuVall joined Alice in Chains as lead singer during the band&#x27;s reunion concerts in 2006, and made his first public performance with the band at VH1&#x27;s &quot;Decades Rock Live&quot; concert. According to Cantrell, it only took one audition for DuVall to get the gig. For his first rehearsal with the band, DuVall sang &quot;Love, Hate, Love&quot;. After they finished, Sean Kinney looked at his bandmates and said, &quot;I think the search is pretty much over.&quot; According to Mike Inez, DuVall didn&#x27;t try to emulate Staley, and that&#x27;s what drew them to him.

Cantrell revealed that before he suggested DuVall for the band, Sean Kinney and Mike Inez invited Sponge and Spys4Darwin lead vocalist Vin Dombroski to jam with the band in their rehearsal space. Dombroski jammed with them to a couple of songs but they did not feel he was right for the band. According to Cantrell, Stone Temple Pilots and Velvet Revolver lead singer Scott Weiland was also interested in joining the band.

Cantrell explained the reunion saying, We want to celebrate what we did and the memory of our friend. We have played with some [singers] who can actually bring it and add their own thing to it without being a Layne clone. We&#x27;re not interested in stepping on [Staley&#x27;s] rich legacy. It&#x27;s a tough thing to go through. Do you take the Led Zeppelin approach and never play again, because the guy was that important? That&#x27;s the approach we&#x27;ve taken for a lot of years. Or, do you give it a shot, try something? We&#x27;re willing to take a chance on it. It&#x27;s completely a reunion because the three of us who&#x27;re left are back together. But it&#x27;s not about separating and forgetting—it&#x27;s about remembering and moving on. Before the tour, Kinney mentioned in an interview that he would be interested in writing new material, but not as Alice in Chains.

During the VH1 Rock Honors concert honoring Heart on May 12, 2007, Alice in Chains performed Heart&#x27;s &quot;Barracuda&quot; fronted by country singer Gretchen Wilson. Heart&#x27;s guitarist Nancy Wilson also joined them onstage.

Alice in Chains joined Velvet Revolver for a run of U.S. and Canadian gigs from August through October 2007. During that tour, the band also performed four special acoustic-only shows, named as &quot;The Acoustic Hour&quot;. The acoustic performance at The Rave/Eagles Club in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on August 31, 2007, was recorded for an upcoming live album.
On November 2, 2007, Alice in Chains performed a four-song set at Benaroya Hall in Seattle for Matt Messina and the Symphony Guild&#x27;s 10th anniversary benefit concert for the Seattle Children&#x27;s Hospital &amp; Regional Medical Center. In addition to the band&#x27;s original material, they also played a cover of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Kashmir&quot; while backed by over 200 musicians, including the Northwest Symphony Orchestra and the Northwest Girlchoir.

Sean Kinney said about the band&#x27;s reunion: I never called Jerry; he never called me, and said, &#x27;Hey, let&#x27;s get the band back together,&#x27; you know? We had been taking every step extremely cautious and slow, and just doing whatever feels right: If it&#x27;s genuine and we&#x27;re doing it for genuine reasons and we&#x27;re all okay with it then we take a little step. None of us is broke. Nobody needs to be a rock dork, and you know, stroke their ego. I mean, we don&#x27;t really operate like that. So as long as it felt good and from the right place and it&#x27;s about making music and carrying on...

About the pressure being put on DuVall for replacing Staley as lead vocalist, Cantrell said, To put all that weight on Will&#x27;s shoulders is unfair. We&#x27;re just figuring out how we work as a team. Although the band has changed, we&#x27;ve lost Layne, we&#x27;ve added Will, and there was no master plan. Playing again in 2005 felt right, so we did the next thing and toured. We did it step by step. It&#x27;s more than just making music, and it always has been. We&#x27;ve been friends a long time. We&#x27;ve been more of a family than most, and it had to be okay from here [pointing to his heart].

Former The Doors manager Bill Siddons and his management company, Core Entertainment, co-managed Alice in Chains with original manager Susan Silver from 2005 to 2007.

The band started writing and demoing songs for a new album with DuVall in April 2007. But the band did not show further signs of progress until October 2008, when they announced that they had begun recording with producer Nick Raskulinecz in the studio.

===2008–2011: &quot;Black Gives Way to Blue&quot; and death of Mike Starr===
Blabbermouth.net reported on September 5, 2008, that Alice in Chains would enter the studio that October to begin recording a new album for a summer 2009 release. On September 14, 2008, Alice in Chains performed at halftime during the Seattle Seahawks vs San Francisco 49ers game at the Qwest Field (now named Lumen Field ) in Seattle. The 12-minute performance for a crowd of 67,000 people featured a cover of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Kashmir&quot; accompanied by the Northwest Symphony Orchestra.

In October 2008, Alice in Chains began recording its fourth studio album at the Foo Fighters&#x27; Studio 606 in Los Angeles with producer Nick Raskulinecz. The band did not have a record label at the time and the album was funded by Jerry Cantrell and Sean Kinney. At the Revolver Golden God Awards, Cantrell said that the group had finished recording on March 18, 2009, and were mixing the album for a September release. The recording process was completed on Cantrell&#x27;s 43rd birthday and also the same day that William DuVall&#x27;s son was born. In April 2009, it was reported that the new Alice in Chains album would be released by Virgin/EMI, making it the band&#x27;s first label change in its 20-plus year career. Susan Silver, who started managing Alice in Chains in 1988, now co-manages the band with David Benveniste and his Velvet Hammer firm.

On June 11, 2009, Blabbermouth.net reported that the new album would be titled &quot;Black Gives Way to Blue&quot; and was officially set to be released on September 29, 2009. The title first appeared on Amazon.com without any prior announcement from the band. In addition, it was announced that Elton John plays piano on the title track, a tribute to Layne Staley written and sung by Cantrell. The album features new vocalist and rhythm guitarist William DuVall sharing vocal duties with lead guitarist/vocalist Jerry Cantrell, who sings lead vocals on most of the songs. DuVall sings lead vocals on the song &quot;Last of My Kind&quot;.

On June 30, 2009, the song &quot;A Looking in View&quot; was made available for purchase via iTunes and Amazon, and for a limited time it was available as a free download through the official Alice in Chains website in early July. Although it was not the album&#x27;s first radio single, Rock stations across the U.S. started playing the song. The music video for &quot;A Looking in View&quot; debuted via the band&#x27;s official website on July 7, 2009. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance.

&quot;Check My Brain&quot; was released to radio stations as the first official single from the album on August 14, 2009, and was made available for purchase on August 17, 2009. The music video for &quot;Check My Brain&quot; premiered on September 14, 2009. The song was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance.

To promote the album, the band released an EPK featuring all four of the members being interviewed while the Kiss makeup is being applied on them. An app for iPhone was released on October 27, 2009, featuring songs, music videos, news, photos and networking.

Sean Kinney said about the new album and the fans&#x27; mixed reactions about the band moving on after Staley&#x27;s death: Look, it&#x27;s a big move to fucking stand up and move on. Some people, the music connected with them so strongly, their opinions, how they feel about it ... It&#x27;s amazing that they have such a connection but they seem to act like it happened to them. This happened to us and Layne&#x27;s family, not them. This is actually our lives. If we&#x27;re okay with it, why can&#x27;t you be? This happened to us, this didn&#x27;t happen to you. But this album isn&#x27;t about that, it&#x27;s a bigger universal point. We&#x27;re all going to fucking die, we&#x27;re all going to lose somebody, and it fucking hurts. How do you move on? This record is us moving on, and hurting. That, to me, is a victory. I already feel like I&#x27;ve won. Sometimes people ask us, &#x27;Wouldn&#x27;t Layne have been pissed off that we did this?&#x27; And I tell them it would have been the opposite: he would have been pissed off that it took us so long to do this. We&#x27;re not doing this for money; there is no money in the music business anymore. Jerry and I funded the whole album, and we spent lots of our own money, because we believe in this. And one of the reasons I&#x27;m doing this is so more light is turned on to something where the light was turned off. And Cantrell added: &quot;We&#x27;ve toured around the world, we&#x27;ve lost some friends, we buried a dear friend, and somebody that you just can&#x27;t fucking replace, and then we&#x27;ve chosen by circumstance to get together again. That turned into &#x27;maybe we can fucking do this.&#x27; And that turned into this.&quot;

In September 2008, it was announced that Alice in Chains would headline Australia&#x27;s Soundwave Festival in 2009, alongside Nine Inch Nails and Lamb of God. In February 2009, it was also announced that Alice in Chains would play at the third annual Rock on the Range festival. On August 1, 2009, Alice in Chains performed, along with Mastodon, Avenged Sevenfold, and Glyder, at Marlay Park, Dublin as direct support to Metallica. The band made an appearance on &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot; on November 10, 2009, performing &quot;Lesson Learned&quot;, &quot;Black Gives Way to Blue&quot;, and &quot;Check My Brain&quot; as the final performance of the episode.

To coincide with the band&#x27;s European tour, Alice in Chains released its next single, &quot;Your Decision&quot;, on November 16, 2009, in the UK and on December 1 in the US. The last single from the album was &quot;Lesson Learned&quot;, and it was released to rock radio on June 22, 2010.

&quot;Black Gives Way to Blue&quot; debuted at No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. On May 18, 2010, the album was certified gold by the RIAA for selling over 500,000 copies in the U.S. The singles &quot;&quot;Check My Brain&quot; and &quot;Your Decision&quot; reached No. 1 on Billboard&#x27;s Mainstream Rock Tracks, while &quot;Lesson Learned&quot;&quot; reached No. 4. &quot;Check My Brain&quot; was also the band&#x27;s first No. 1 song on the Alternative Songs chart, and on the Hot Rock Songs chart, it also reached No. 92 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100, becoming the band&#x27;s first single to appear on the chart.

Along with Mastodon and Deftones, Alice in Chains toured the United States and Canada in late 2010 on the Blackdiamondskye tour, an amalgam of the three bands&#x27; latest album titles (&quot;Black Gives Way to Blue&quot;, &quot;Diamond Eyes&quot;, and &quot;Crack the Skye&quot;).

On March 8, 2011, former Alice in Chains bassist Mike Starr was found dead at his home in Salt Lake City. Police told Reuters they were called to Starr&#x27;s home at 1:42 pm and found his body; Starr was 44. Reports later surfaced that Starr&#x27;s roommate had seen him mixing methadone and anxiety medication hours before he was found dead. Later reports indicated Starr&#x27;s death may have been linked to two different types of antidepressants prescribed to him by his doctor. A public memorial was held for Starr at the Seattle Center&#x27;s International Fountain on March 20, 2011. A private memorial was also held, which Jerry Cantrell and Sean Kinney attended according to Mike Inez.

===2011–2016: &quot;The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here&quot;===
On March 21, 2011, Alice in Chains announced that they were working on a fifth studio album, and both Cantrell and Inez later made statements that they had begun the recording process. The album was expected to be finished by summer of 2012 and released by the end of 2012 or beginning of 2013. While Alice in Chains were writing for the album in 2011, Cantrell underwent surgery on his right shoulder, which delayed recording the new material. In an interview published in May 2012, Cantrell explained, &quot;The thing that set me back is I had some bone spurs [and] cartilage issues in my shoulders. I had the same issue in the other shoulder about six years ago so I&#x27;ve had them both done now. It&#x27;s a repetitive motion injury from playing.&quot; Cantrell could not play guitar for eight months while he was recovering from surgery. While recuperating at home in a sling, Cantrell heard a riff in his head and sang it into his phone. The riff later became the song &quot;Stone&quot;.

Alice in Chains played their first concert in nearly 10 months and their first concert after Cantrell&#x27;s shoulder surgery at the Winstar Casino in Thackerville, Oklahoma on August 13, 2011. The band&#x27;s only concert in 2012 was a five-song acoustic set on May 31 at the eighth annual MusiCares MAP Fund Benefit Concert honoring Jerry Cantrell.
On December 4, 2012, Cantrell confirmed that the new album had been completed. The first single, &quot;Hollow&quot;, debuted online on December 18, available for digital download in January 2013, along with an official music video. On February 13, 2013, Alice in Chains posted on Facebook that their new album title would be an anagram of the letters H V L E N T P S U S D A H I E E O E D T I U R R. The next day they announced that the album would be called &quot;The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here&quot;, which was released on May 28, 2013, and debuted at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

To promote the album, Alice in Chains teamed up with Funny or Die for an 11-minute mockumentary titled &quot;AIC 23&quot;, in which Film Studies professor Alan Poole McLard (played by W. Earl Brown) attempts to make a documentary on Alice in Chains without any help from the actual band, interviewing other musicians instead. Among them are country singer Donnie &#x27;Skeeter&#x27; Dollarhide Jr. (played by Jerry Cantrell), Reggae singer Nesta Cleveland (played by William DuVall), Black Metal musician Unta Gleeben Glabben Globben Globin (played by Mike Inez) and the hipster Stanley Eisen (played by Sean Kinney). The video was released on April 3, 2013, and also features cameos by Ann and Nancy Wilson from Heart, Mike McCready from Pearl Jam, Kim Thayil from Soundgarden, Duff McKagan from Guns N&#x27; Roses, Brent Hinds and Bill Kelliher from Mastodon, and Lars Ulrich and Robert Trujillo from Metallica.

In June 2013, the band released a pinball game app for iOS as part of &quot;Pinball Rocks&quot; HD compilation, featuring the single &quot;Hollow&quot;, the band&#x27;s logo and the album artwork, as well as references to the band&#x27;s previous albums such as &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; and the self-titled record.

The band released videos for the songs &quot;Hollow&quot;, &quot;Stone&quot;, &quot;Voices&quot;, the title track and &quot;Phantom Limb&quot;. &quot;Hollow&quot; and &quot;Stone&quot; reached No. 1 on Billboard&#x27;s Mainstream Rock Tracks, while &quot;Voices&quot; reached No. 3, and each one of the three songs stayed on the chart for 20 weeks. &quot;The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical in 2014.

Alice in Chains toured extensively in the U.S., Canada, and Europe in 2013 and 2014. In May 2013, the band co-headlined the annual MMRBQ festival with Soundgarden in Camden, New Jersey. Asked in September 2013 if Alice in Chains would make another album, Cantrell replied, &quot;It&#x27;ll be a while. It&#x27;s [been] four years since we put the last one out, but at least it&#x27;s not the gap that was between the last one, so that&#x27;s about right - about three to four years.&quot;

On January 18, 2015, Alice in Chains performed in the halftime show of the NFC Championship Game between the Seattle Seahawks and the Green Bay Packers at CenturyLink Field in Seattle. Cantrell is a lifelong Seahawks fan and often attends their games. In August 2015, Bassist Mike Inez said that the band had been &quot;throwing around riffs for a new record&quot; and &quot;taking it nice and slow&quot;. The band toured in the summer of 2015 and the summer of 2016, including select shows opening for Guns N&#x27; Roses as part of the Not in This Lifetime... Tour. The band finished their 2016 tour with a concert at the Grand Sierra Resort and Casino in Reno, Nevada on October 8, 2016.

In November 2016, Alice in Chains released a cover of the Rush song &quot;Tears&quot;, which was included in the 40th anniversary release of the album &quot;2112&quot;. The home video &quot;Live Facelift&quot; was released on vinyl for the first time on November 25, 2016, as part of Record Store Day&#x27;s Black Friday event. The album features six songs and only 5000 copies were issued.

To celebrate the tenth anniversary of Record Store Day, on April 22, 2017, Legacy Recordings released &quot;Get Born Again&quot;/&quot;What the Hell Have I&quot;, a special 45 RPM double 7&quot; single featuring four tracks remastered and available on vinyl for the first time, &quot;What the Hell Have I&quot;, &quot;A Little Bitter&quot;, &quot;Get Born Again&quot; and &quot;Died&quot;.

===2017–2021: &quot;Rainier Fog&quot;===
In January 2017, Mike Inez stated in an interview that the band had begun work on a new album. In June 2017, it was reported that the band would return to Studio X (formerly Bad Animals Studios) in Seattle to record a new album later that month, for a tentative early 2018 release. The sessions were helmed by Nick Raskulinecz, who produced the band&#x27;s last two albums. Studio X was the studio where Alice in Chains recorded its 1995 self-titled album. According to Inez, the band was not signed to a label, having completed its previous two-record contract with the Universal Music Group. &quot;This [upcoming album], we&#x27;re not sure where it&#x27;s gonna land ... I mean, we financed [&#x27;Black Gives Way To Blue&#x27;] on our own too, so we&#x27;re not too worried about that stuff. We&#x27;ve just gotta get it out to ... a significant label [with worldwide distribution].&quot;

The band started recording their sixth studio album on June 12, 2017. On January 11, 2018, producer Nick Raskulinecz announced via Instagram that the album was nearly finished and that there was only one more day left of recording. During an interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot; published on April 11, 2018, Jerry Cantrell said that the album was recorded at four studios. After recording at Studio X in Seattle, the band went to Nashville to record vocals and lead guitars at Nick Raskulinecz&#x27;s home studio. But Cantrell had to take an unexpected break from work for a couple of weeks after getting sick on a trip to Cabo for Sammy Hagar&#x27;s birthday. Cantrell had the band&#x27;s engineer, Paul Figueroa, come in to his house and record a lot of his vocals and solos there. The band finished recording the album at the Henson Recording Studios in Los Angeles. Cantrell also said he expected the album to be released &quot;probably sometime this summer.&quot;

At the press room of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony on April 14, 2018, Cantrell revealed that Alice in Chains had just signed with BMG, and that they had finished mixing their new album.

Alice in Chains did not perform live in 2017. The band performed their first concert since October 2016 at the House of Blues in Boston on April 28, 2018. In May 2018, Alice in Chains headlined the festivals Carolina Rebellion, Lunatic Luau, Pointfest, Northern Invasion, the WMMR BBQ festival in Philadelphia, and the Rock on the Range festival in Columbus, Ohio on May 18, 2018, in which they paid tribute to Chris Cornell on the first anniversary of his death covering two Soundgarden songs to close their set, &quot;Hunted Down&quot; and &quot;Boot Camp&quot;, respectively. At the end of the show, the lights on stage spelled out &quot;CC&quot; for Chris Cornell and &quot;SG&quot; for Soundgarden as feedback rang out. The band started their European tour in June 2018, and headlined the Tons Of Rock Festival in Norway alongside Ozzy Osbourne and Helloween. Alice in Chains are also scheduled to headline KISW&#x27;s Pain in the Grass festival in August 2018.

The band released a new single, &quot;The One You Know&quot;, via Spotify, Amazon and iTunes on May 3, 2018. A music video directed by Adam Mason was released on YouTube the same day. &quot;The One You Know&quot; peaked at No. 9 on Billboard&#x27;s Mainstream Rock chart.

During an interview with Eddie Trunk on &quot;Trunk Nation&quot; on May 7, 2018, Jerry Cantrell said that the new album would be released at the end of August 2018. The band also revealed that they talked to director Adam Mason, who is making a dark sci-film, about doing two separate pieces of art and maybe molding them together, and that the music video for &quot;The One You Know&quot; is the first chapter of molding Mason&#x27;s film and the band&#x27;s music videos together.

The second single, &quot;So Far Under&quot;, was released on Alice in Chains&#x27; YouTube channel and on streaming platforms on June 27, 2018. It was also announced that the album would be titled &quot;Rainier Fog&quot;, with the release date scheduled for August 24, 2018. The album&#x27;s artwork and the track listing were also revealed on the same day. Jerry Cantrell told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that the title &quot;Rainier Fog&quot; was inspired by the Mount Rainier in Seattle, and the title track is a tribute to the Seattle music scene. &quot;This song is a little homage to all of that: where we come from, who we are, all of the triumphs, all of the tragedies, lives lived.&quot;

The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Never Fade&quot;, was released on August 10, 2018, through digital and streaming services. The song is a tribute dedicated to frontman William DuVall&#x27;s grandmother, Chris Cornell, and Alice in Chains&#x27; original singer Layne Staley. &quot;Never Fade&quot; peaked at No. 10 on Billboard&#x27;s Mainstream Rock chart. A music video directed by Adam Mason was released on November 1, 2018, and continued the storyline from the music video of &quot;The One You Know&quot;.

In June 2018, William DuVall said in an interview with Swedish website &quot;Rocksverige&quot; that the music video for &quot;The One You Know&quot; is the first chapter of what the band is hoping will be visuals for all ten songs from the album &quot;Rainier Fog&quot;, and in addition to that, will be a companion piece to the film that director Adam Mason was shooting.

On August 20, 2018, the baseball team Seattle Mariners hosted a special &quot;Alice in Chains Night&quot; at the Safeco Field in Seattle to promote &quot;Rainier Fog&quot;, with the team offering the fans a package that included a Safeco Field terrace club ticket, access to a pre-game listening party of the album, an Alice in Chains T-shirt and a Rainier Fog CD. Jerry Cantrell also threw out the ceremonial first pitch and delivered a strike before the Seattle Mariners vs. Houston Astros game.

To mark the launch of the album, on August 21, 2018, Alice in Chains performed an acoustic set at the top of Seattle&#x27;s Space Needle and debuted the song &quot;Fly&quot;. Alice in Chains were the first band to perform on the Space Needle&#x27;s new &quot;Loupe&quot; glass floor, the world&#x27;s first and only revolving glass floor 500 feet high. The concert was exclusive for an audience of SiriusXM subscribers. SiriusXM broadcast the concert on their channel Lithium on August 31, 2018.
On August 22, 2018, Alice in Chains sent fans on a scavenger hunt to access a secret gig that the band would be performing in Seattle on August 24. Ten signed CD copies of &quot;Rainier Fog&quot; were hidden around the city as a ticket into the show, and the band asked the fans to keep an eye on their Instagram story for details on the 10 hidden locations. Once all 10 albums were found, the band revealed that the secret gig would be at the rock club The Crocodile, with limited tickets available with the purchase of their album at a pop-up event at the same venue the next day. Preview clips of each of the album tracks were posted on the band&#x27;s Instagram. The band also commemorated the release of the album with a pop-up museum installation at The Crocodile in Seattle on August 23 and 24. The museum featured rare Alice in Chains photos, limited-edition merchandise and memorabilia that showcased the band&#x27;s 30+ year career.

&quot;Rainier Fog&quot; debuted at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 31,000 copies (29,000 in traditional album sales), in its first week of release. The album also debuted at No. 1 on Billboard&#x27;s Top Rock Albums, Alternative Albums and Hard Rock Albums charts, and at No. 3 on the Vinyl Albums chart. &quot;Rainier Fog&quot; became Alice in Chains&#x27; first top 10 in the UK, peaking at No. 9, and topping UK&#x27;s Rock &amp; Metal Albums chart. The album has been nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album.

On December 13, 2018, the teaser of the film &quot;Black Antenna&quot; featuring the song &quot;Rainier Fog&quot; was released on Alice in Chains&#x27; official YouTube channel, with drummer Sean Kinney stating; &quot;We&#x27;ve always toyed with the idea of creating videos for every song on one of our albums. Not only did we do that for &quot;Rainier Fog&quot;, it got totally out of hand and we made a whole goddamn movie. Everything that will be seen in the videos will be footage from &quot;Black Antenna&quot; to preface the complete film&#x27;s release.&quot; &quot;Rainier Fog&quot; was released as a single on February 26, 2019. The official trailer for &quot;Black Antenna&quot; was released on Alice in Chains&#x27; YouTube Channel on February 28, 2019. Besides a 90-minute film, a 10-part web-series focused on each track from the album was planned. Episodes 1 and 2, &quot;The One You Know&quot; and &quot;Rainier Fog&quot;, respectively, were released on March 7, 2019. The tenth and last episode, &quot;All I Am&quot;, was released on July 17, 2019. The official music video for &quot;Rainier Fog&quot; was released on YouTube on May 15, 2019, and was co-directed by Alice in Chains and Peter Darley Miller, who also directed the band&#x27;s 2013 mockumentary, &quot;AIC 23&quot;.

On December 1, 2020, Alice in Chains was honored with the Founders Award from Seattle&#x27;s Museum of Pop Culture. The benefit concert featured tribute performances from artists such as Ann Wilson, Korn, Metallica, Fishbone, Dallas Green, Billy Corgan, Tad Doyle, members of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, among others. The event was made available for streaming for free and raised more than $600,000 for the museum in its first night. A compilation featuring highlights from the tribute was made available for streaming on Amazon Music.

===2022–present: Upcoming seventh studio album===
In an April 2022 interview, vocalist William DuVall revealed that he was &quot;sure&quot; Alice in Chains would begin working on their seventh studio album later in the year: We had a lot of time imposed on us and I think we&#x27;re going through this period of catching up on things that we had planned for 2020 [and] 2021, and we&#x27;re all finally getting to do that now. So, it&#x27;s kind of like a stopgap and we&#x27;re just dealing with all of these stockpiled projects that we had planned a few years back. So once we get back up to speed with things and we get these dates underway in late summer, I&#x27;m sure it will spark a whole bunch of ideas for the next Alice in Chains studio album.

However, in March 2023, DuVall stated there were &quot;no plans&quot; for new Alice in Chains music.

==Artistry==
===Musical style===
Although Alice in Chains has been labeled grunge by the mainstream media, Jerry Cantrell identifies the band as primarily heavy metal. He told &quot;Guitar World&quot; in 1996, &quot;We&#x27;re a lot of different things  ... I don&#x27;t quite know what the mixture is, but there&#x27;s definitely metal, blues, rock and roll, maybe a touch of punk. The metal part will never leave, and I never want it to.&quot; The &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; has stated, &quot;Living and playing in Seattle might have got them the grunge tag, but they&#x27;ve always pretty much been a classic metal band to the core.&quot; A 1995 review of &quot;Alice in Chains&quot; from &quot;People&quot; dubbed the band &quot;Seattle&#x27;s most malevolent-sounding grunge outfit.&quot;

Over the course of their career, the band&#x27;s sound has also been described as alternative metal, sludge metal, alternative rock, doom metal, and hard rock. Furthermore, the band have also incorporated styles including blues rock, folk rock, funk metal and jangle pop into their music. Regarding the band&#x27;s constant categorization by the media, Cantrell stated: When we first came out we were metal. Then we started being called alternative metal. Then grunge came out and then we were hard rock. And now, since we&#x27;ve started doing this again I&#x27;ve seen us listed as: hard rock, alternative, alternative metal and just straight metal. I walked into an HMV the other day to check out the placement and see what&#x27;s on and they&#x27;ve got us relegated back into the metal section. Right back where we started! Drummer Sean Kinney rejects the grunge label, stating in a 2013 interview &quot;I mean, before we first came out there was no grunge, they hadn&#x27;t invented that word. Before they invented the word grunge we were alternative rock and alternative metal and metal and rock, and we didn&#x27;t give a shit whatever, we were a rock and roll band!&quot; According to Mike Inez, they were always the metal stepchildren of the Seattle scene.

===Influences===
The band are influenced to a great extent by English metal music; in 2018, Jerry Cantrell proclaimed Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi as &quot;one of his biggest&quot; inspirations, while Layne Staley named his &quot;first influences&quot; as Black Sabbath and Deep Purple. The group&#x27;s work with recording engineer Dave Jerden came about because upon meeting the band, recalling: &quot;&#x27;Metallica took Tony Iommi and sped him up. What you&#x27;ve done is you&#x27;ve slowed him down again.&#x27; And [Cantrell] looked at me and said, &#x27;You got it.&#x27; That&#x27;s how I got the gig. I totally understood what they were doing.&quot; Cantrell adjudged English rock singer Elton John as &quot;the artist that made me want to be a musician.&quot; In addition, members of Alice in Chains have cited artists including AC/DC, Accept, Aerosmith, The Beatles, Black Flag, David Bowie, John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Dio, Funkadelic, Hanoi Rocks, Heart, Jimi Hendrix, Iron Maiden, Jethro Tull,King&#x27;s X, Kiss, Led Zeppelin, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Metallica, Steve Miller, Eddie Money, Motörhead, Mudhoney, Ted Nugent, Pink Floyd, the Pixies, Queen, Queensrÿche, the Rolling Stones, Rush, Scorpions, Soundgarden, The Stooges, Television, Thin Lizzy, Robin Trower, U2, UFO, Van Halen, the Velvet Underground, Hank Williams, and ZZ Top as influential or inspirational.

===Instrumentation and lyrics===
Jerry Cantrell&#x27;s guitar style combines &quot;pummeling riffs and expansive guitar textures&quot; to create &quot;slow, brooding minor-key grinds&quot;. He is also recognized for his natural ability to blend acoustic and electric guitars. While down-tuned, distorted guitars mixed with Staley&#x27;s distinctive &quot;snarl-to-a-scream&quot; vocals appealed to heavy metal fans, the band also had &quot;a sense of melody that was undeniable,&quot; which introduced Alice in Chains to a much wider audience outside of the heavy metal underground.

According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, Alice in Chains&#x27; sound has a &quot;Black Sabbath-style riffing and an unconventional vocal style.&quot; The band has been described by Erlewine as &quot;hard enough for metal fans, yet their dark subject matter and punky attack placed them among the front ranks of the Seattle-based grunge bands.&quot; Three of the band&#x27;s releases feature acoustic music, and while the band initially kept these releases separate, Alice in Chains&#x27; self-titled album combined the styles to form &quot;a bleak, nihilistic sound that balanced grinding hard rock with subtly textured acoustic numbers.&quot;

Alice in Chains is also noted for the unique vocal harmonies of Staley (or DuVall) and Cantrell, which included overlapping passages, dual lead vocals, and trademark harmonies typically separated by a major third. Cantrell said it was Staley who gave him the self-assurance to sing his own songs. Alyssa Burrows said the band&#x27;s distinctive sound &quot;came from Staley&#x27;s vocal style and his lyrics dealing with personal struggles and addiction.&quot; Staley&#x27;s songs were often considered &quot;dark&quot;, with themes such as drug abuse, depression, and suicide, while Cantrell&#x27;s lyrics often dealt with personal relationships.

===Influence===
Pantera and Damageplan guitarist Dimebag Darrell had expressed his admiration for Cantrell&#x27;s guitar work in an interview for &quot;Guitar International&quot; in 1995, saying that &quot;the layering and the honest feel that Jerry Cantrell gets on [Alice in Chains&#x27; &quot;Dirt&quot;] record is worth a lot more than someone who plays five million notes.&quot;

Street musician Wesley Willis wrote a song about the band entitled &quot;Alice in Chains&quot;, featured on his 1996 album &quot;Feel The Power&quot;. Billy Corgan revealed that the song &quot;Bleeding The Orchid&quot; from the Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; 2007 album &quot;Zeitgeist&quot; has a bit of an homage to Alice in Chains in the harmonies and was indirectly inspired by the death of Staley.

Elton John stated that he is a fan of Alice in Chains and a big admirer of Cantrell. According to Jon Wiederhorn of MTV, Godsmack has &quot;sonically followed Alice in Chains&#x27; lead while adding their own distinctive edge.&quot; Godsmack singer and founder Sully Erna has also cited Staley as his primary influence. Godsmack was named after the Alice in Chains song &quot;God Smack&quot; from the album &quot;Dirt&quot;. Staind has covered Alice in Chains&#x27; song &quot;Nutshell&quot; live, which appears on the compilation &quot;The Singles: 1996-2006&quot;, and also wrote a song entitled &quot;Layne&quot;, dedicated to Staley, on the album &quot;14 Shades of Grey&quot;. Three Days Grace also performs a cover of &quot;Rooster&quot;, which can be seen on the DVD &quot;Live at the Palace&quot;.

Metallica said they have always wanted to tour with the band, citing Alice in Chains as a major inspiration for their 2008 release, &quot;Death Magnetic&quot;.

Alice in Chains has also had a significant influence on modern heavy metal. Their songs were covered by various metal bands such as In Flames, Opeth, Dream Theater, Secrets of the Moon, Suicide Silence, 36 Crazyfists, Cane Hill, Ektomorf, Dritt Skitt, Grave and Thou, who described their 2018 EP &quot;Rhea Sylvia&quot; as &quot;a melodic grunge, Alice in Chains homage.&quot; In 2009, Anders Fridén of Swedish melodic death metal band In Flames cited Layne Staley as an inspiration for his vocals on the band&#x27;s later albums. In addition to fellow musicians, the band has also received praise from critics, with Steve Huey calling them &quot;one of the best metal bands of the &#x27;90s&quot; upon reviewing the 1999 compilation &quot;Nothing Safe&quot;.

In 2009, the Vitamin String Quartet released the album &quot;The String Quartet Tribute to Alice in Chains&quot;, featuring instrumental versions on viola, violin and cello of 12 of the band&#x27;s biggest hits.

===Media===
In August 2015, journalist David de Sola published the biography &quot;Alice in Chains: The Untold Story&quot;. An updated version covering the period from 2014 to 2017 was published in November 2018. Neither the band nor their management had any involvement with the book. Sources tied directly to the band were interviewed instead.

<text>Mehmed VI Vahideddin ( &quot;Meḥmed-i sâdis&quot; or &quot;Vaḥîdü&#x27;d-Dîn&quot;; or /; 14 January 1861 – 16 May 1926), also known as &quot;Şahbaba&quot; () among the Osmanoğlu family, was the last sultan of the Ottoman Empire and the penultimate Ottoman caliph, reigning from 4 July 1918 until 1 November 1922, when the Ottoman sultanate was abolished and replaced by the Republic of Turkey on 29 October 1923.

The brother of Mehmed V Reşâd, he became heir to the throne in 1916, after the death of Şehzade Yusuf Izzeddin, as the eldest male member of the House of Osman. He acceded to the throne after the death of Mehmed V. He was girded with the Sword of Osman on 4 July 1918 as the 36th &quot;padishah&quot; and 115th Islamic Caliph.

Mehmed VI&#x27;s reign began with the Ottoman Empire suffering defeat by the Allied Powers with the conclusion of World War I. The subsequent Armistice of Mudros legitimized further Allied incursions into Ottoman territory, resulting in an informal occupation of Istanbul and other parts of the empire. An initial process of reconciliation between the government and Christian minorities over their massacres and deportations by the government ultimately proved fruitless, when the Greeks and Armenians, via their patriarchates, renounced their status as Ottoman subjects by the end of 1918, spelling a definitive end of Ottomanism. During the Paris Peace Conference, Mehmed VI turned to Damat Ferid Pasha to diplomatically outflank Greek territorial demands on the Ottoman Empire through Allied appeasement, but to no avail. Unionist elements within the Ottoman military, discontent with the government&#x27;s appeasement in the face of partition, and the establishment of war crimes tribunals, began taking actions into their own hands by establishing a nationalist resistance. Mehmed&#x27;s most significant act as Sultan was dispatching Mustafa Kemal Pasha (Atatürk) to reassert government control in Anatolia, which actually resulted in the further consolidation of anti-appeasement actors against the court, and consequently, the end of the monarchy.

With the Greek Occupation of Smyrna on 15 May 1919 galvanizing the Turkish nationalist movement and beginning the Turkish War of Independence, by October the sultan&#x27;s government had to give in to nationalist demands with the Amasya Protocol. With the Turkish nationalists standing against Allied designs for a partition of Ottoman Anatolia, the Allies militarily occupied Istanbul on 16 March 1920, and pressured Sultan Mehmed VI to dissolve the Nationalist dominated Chamber of Deputies, ending the Second Constitutional Era. Kemal Pasha responded by establishing a provisional government known as the Grand National Assembly based in Ankara, which dominated the rest of the Ottoman Empire, while the Sultan&#x27;s unpopular government in Istanbul was propped up by the Allied powers and effectively impotent. Mehmed VI condemned the nationalist leaders as infidels and called for their execution, though the provisional government in Ankara claimed it was rescuing the Sultan-Caliph from manipulative foreigners and ministers. The Sultan&#x27;s so-called Istanbul government would go on to sign the Treaty of Sèvres, a peace treaty which would have partitioned the remainder of the empire, leaving a rump Turkish state. With Ankara&#x27;s victory in the independence war, the Sèvres Treaty was abandoned for their Treaty of Lausanne. On 1 November 1922, the Grand National Assembly voted to abolish the Sultanate and to depose Mehmed VI as Caliph, and he left for Europe in exile. On 29 October 1923, the Republic of Turkey was declared, with Mustafa Kemal as its first president.

==Early life and education==

Mehmed Vahdeddin was born at the Dolmabahçe Palace, in Constantinople, on 14 January 1861. His father was Abdulmejid I, who died when he was only five months old, and Vahdeddin&#x27;s mother Gülistu Kadın died when he was four years old. She was of Georgian-Abkhazian origin, being the daughter of Prince Tahir Bey Chachba. 

After his mother&#x27;s death, Vahdeddin Efendi was raised and taught by Şayeste Hanım, another of his father&#x27;s consorts. He trained himself by taking lessons from private teachers and attending some of the lessons given at the Fatih Madrasa. The prince had a rough time with his overbearing adoptive mother, and at the age of 16 he left his adoptive mother&#x27;s mansion with the three servants who had been serving him since childhood. He grew up with nannies, female servants, and tutors. During the thirty-three years of his brother Sultan Abdul Hamid II&#x27;s reign he lived in the Ottoman Imperial Harem.
During his youth his closest friend was Abdul Mejid (to be proclaimed as Caliph Abdul Mejid II), the son of his uncle, Sultan Abdul Aziz. In the years to come, however, the two cousins became unyielding rivals. Before moving to the Feriye Palace, the prince had lived briefly in the mansion in Çengelköy owned by Şehzade Ahmed Kemaleddin. During the reign of Sultan Abdul Hamid II, Vahdeddin was considered to be the sultan&#x27;s closest brother. When he ascended to the throne, this closeness greatly influenced his political attitudes, such as his intense dislike of the Young Turks and the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), and his sympathy for the British.

Mehmed took private lessons. He read a great deal, and was interested in various subjects, including the arts, which was a tradition of the Ottoman family. He took courses in calligraphy and music and learned how to write in the naskh script and to play the qanun. He became interested in Sufism and, unknown to the Palace, he attended courses at the madrasa of Fatih on Islamic jurisprudence, Islamic theology, interpretation of the Quran, and the Hadiths, as well as the Arabic and Persian languages. He attended the dervish lodge of Ahmed Ziyaüddin Gümüşhanevi, located not far from the Sublime Porte, where Ömer Ziyaüddin of Dagestan was the spiritual leader, and he became a disciple of the Naqshbandi order.

Vahdeddin held a quiet rivalry with his brother Crown Prince Yusuf İzzeddin and repeatedly requested that his brother Sultan Mehmed V Reshad retract İzzeddin as heir apparent. In the end İzzeddin committed suicide in 1916, putting Vahdeddin on track to succeed his brother upon his death.

In 1917 he went on a five-week trip to Germany, accompanied by his aide-de-camp, Mustafa Kemal Pasha (Atatürk).

==Reign==
Mehmed Vahdeddin succeeded to the throne after the death of his half-brother, and took the name of Mehmed VI, on 3 July 1918. He held his Cülûs (enthronement ceremony) the day after. Instead of commissioning his own anthem he signed an edict making his grandfather Mahmud II&#x27;s anthem as the official national anthem of the Ottoman Empire. Vahdeddin reappointed Talat Pasha as Grand Vizier for another term and Mustafa Kemal Pasha commander of Seventh Army.

The end of the Great War allowed Vahdeddin to reassert the Sultanate, in contrast to his deceased brother who was accommodating to the CUP. With Talat Pasha&#x27;s resignation, Vahdeddin had the opportunity to appoint a new Grand Vizier. Mustafa Kemal Pasha sent a telegram to the Sultan, asking him to appoint Ahmed Izzet Pasha, another anti-Unionist and make himself a minister of war. Izzet Pasha wooed the Sultan by promising to &#x27;secure the dynasty&#x27;s &#x27;legitimate rights&#x27; and restore justice in the nation&#x27;. The sultan assigned the task of forming the government to Izzet, though Mustafa Kemal was excluded from the new cabinet, as well as any minorities. The Sultan soon requested the resignation of Izzet and assigned Ahmed Tevfik Pasha to form a government. In his speech for the opening of the new legislative year of the parliament, he mentioned Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s desire for peace according to his principles, and that he accordingly wanted peace with the appropriate honour and dignity of the state.

The First World War was a disaster for the Ottoman Empire. British and allied forces captured Baghdad, Damascus, and Jerusalem during the war, and most of the Ottoman Empire was set to be divided amongst the European allies. As part of the armistice terms, much of the empire beyond the armistice lines were under occupation, including the Sultan&#x27;s own capital: Constantinople.

A new government, consisting of members of the Liberty and Accord Party, arrested the leaders of the CUP, including one of the former grand viziers, Said Halim Pasha. The trial of Boğazlıyan District Governor Mehmed Kemal Bey was quickly concluded. He was sentenced to death and publicly hanged in Beyazıt Square, after the fatwa was signed by the sultan.

At the San Remo conference of April 1920, the French were granted a mandate over Syria and the British were granted one over Palestine and Mesopotamia. On 22 July 1920, the Sultanic Council (&quot;Şurayı Saltanat&quot;) gathered in Yıldız Palace to discuss the principles of the settlement debated in Sèvres. On 10 August 1920, Mehmed&#x27;s representatives signed the Treaty of Sèvres, which recognised the mandates and Hejaz as an independent state. Since he had to resign two and a half-months later, Damat Ferid Pasha dispatched the last delegation of Tevfik Pasha, the last delegation of the Ottoman Empire, on 2 October 1920.

Turkish nationalists rejected the settlement by the Sultan&#x27;s four signatories. A new government, the Turkish Grand National Assembly, under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Pasha, was formed on 23 April 1920, in Ankara (then known as Angora). The new government denounced the rule of Mehmed VI and the command of Süleyman Şefik Pasha, who was in charge of the army commissioned to fight against the Turkish National Movement (the Kuvâ-i İnzibâtiyye); as a result, a temporary constitution was drafted for Kemal&#x27;s counter-government in Ankara.

==Exile and death==

As the nationalist movement strengthened its military positions in late August 1922, Mehmed VI, his five wives, and attendant eunuchs could no longer leave the safety of the palace. The Grand National Assembly of Turkey abolished the Sultanate on 1 November 1922, and Mehmed VI was expelled from Istanbul. One day before his departure, he had lunch with his daughter, Ulviye Sultan, and spent a night at her palace. Leaving aboard the British warship HMS &quot;Malaya&quot; on 17 November 1922, he took care not to bring valuable items or jewellery, other than his personal belongings. British general Charles Harington himself took the last Ottoman ruler from Yıldız Palace. Ten people with the sultan were sent off early in the morning by an English battalion. He went into exile in Malta, later living on the Italian Riviera.

On 16 November 1922, Vahideddin wrote to Sir Charles Harington: &quot;Sir, considering my life in danger in Istanbul, I take refuge with the British Government and request my transfer as soon as possible from Istanbul to another place. Mehmed Vahideddin, Caliph of the Muslims&quot;. Accompanied by his First Chamberlain, the bandmaster, his doctor, two confidential secretaries, a valet, a barber and two eunuchs, at 6 am on 19 November, two British ambulances took them to the house of General Sir Charles Harington. 

On 19 November, Vahideddin&#x27;s first cousin and heir, Abdul Mejid Efendi, was elected caliph, becoming the new head of the Imperial House of Osman as Abdul Mecid II before the Caliphate was abolished by the Grand National Assembly in 1924.

Mehmed sent a declaration to the Caliphate Congress and protested the preparations made, declaring that he had never waived the right to reign and be caliph. The congress met on 13 May 1926, but Mehmed died without the news of the congress meeting on 16 May 1926 in Sanremo, Italy. His daughter Sabiha Sultan found money for a burial, and the coffin was taken to Syria and buried in the cemetery of the Sulaymaniyya Takiyya in Damascus.

==Personality==
Mehmed had an optimistic and patient personality according to the testimony of his relatives and employees. He was evidently a kind family man in his palace; outside, and especially at official ceremonies, he would stand cold, frowning and serious, and would not compliment anyone; he attached great importance to religious traditions; he would not tolerate rumors, nor would he allow them to circulate in his palace. Even in his informal conversations, he always attracted attention with seriousness. 

The sources in question also state that he was intelligent and quick-grasped, but he was under the influence of his entourage and especially those he believed in, that he had a very evident, unstable and stubborn temperament.

Mehmed VI had dealt with advanced literature, music, and calligraphy. His compositions were performed in the palace when he was on the throne. The lyrics of the songs he repeatedly composed while in Tâif envision the longing of the country and the pain of not getting the news that they have left behind. Sixty-three works belonging to him can be identified, but only forty works have notes. His poems, which can be an example to his poetry, are only the lyrics of his songs. He was also a good calligrapher.

===Consorts===
Mehmed VI had five consorts: 
* Nazikeda Kadın (9 October 1866 – 4 April 1941). Başkadin and only consort for twenty years, she is considered the last Ottoman Empress. She was born Emine Marşania, she was Abkhazian and before marrying Mehmed she was in the service of Cemile Sultan with her sisters and cousins. Mehmed married her in 1885, after a year of insistence and the threat that he would never marry anyone else and the promise that Nazikeda would be his only consort. He kept his word until, after giving him three daughters, Nazikeda could no longer have children, which forced Mehmed to take other consorts to have male heirs. She was described as tall and beautiful, buxom, with fair skin, light hazel eyes, and long auburn hair.
* Inşirah Hanım (10 July 1887 – 10 June 1930). Born Seniye Voçibe, she was Circassian, the niece of Durriaden Kadin, consort of Mehmed V, older half-brother of Mehmed VI. She was tall, with beautiful blue eyes and very long dark brown hair. She was proposed by Mehmed in 1905. Inşirah refused, but was obliged by her father and her brother. Unhappy but still jealous, she divorced Mehmed in 1909, when she found a servant in his quarters. Having divorced before Mehmed&#x27;s accession to the throne, she was never an Imperial Consort. Later she fell into depression. She tried to return to her husband in 1922, when he was in exile at Sanremo, Italy, but she was not allowed to see him and he was not notified of her presence. She attempted suicide twice. The first of hers was saved by her niece, but the second she managed by drowning herself in the Nile.
* Müveddet Kadın (12 October 1893 – 20 December 1951). Second Imperial Consort and only consort other than Nazikeda to obtain the title of Kadın. Born Şadiye Çıhcı, she was introduced to the court by Habibe Hanım, treasurer of Mehmed&#x27;s harem. They were married in 1911. She was tall, with blue eyes and auburn hair and was known as a very sweet, shy, kind-hearted and hardworking woman. She was also loved and respected by her stepdaughters. She bore Mehmed her only son, whose death caused her to fall into depression. After Mehmed&#x27;s death she remarried, but divorced after four years.
* Nevvare Hanım (4 May 1901 – 13 June 1992). Başikbal. Born Ayşe Çıhçı, she was niece of Müveddet Kadın, who raised her. She married Mehmed in 1918, although Müveddet did everything possible to prevent this. She was tall and beautiful, with green eyes and long black hair, of a kind but proud disposition. She filed for divorce in 1922, when Mehmed was deposed and exiled, and she was granted it in 1924. After that, she remarried.
* Nevzad Hanım (2 March 1902 – 23 June 1992). Second Ikbal and last woman to become consort of an Ottoman sultan. Born Nimet Bargu. She married Mehmed in 1921, previously she had been a Kalfa (servant) in the household of Şehzade Mehmed Ziyaeddin, son of Sultan Mehmed V. She was Mehmed&#x27;s favorite consort in his later years, so much so that it is said that he never agreed to part with her. After Mehmed&#x27;s death she changed her name back to Nimet and remarried. By her second marriage she had a son and a daughter. She never agreed to talk about her years as Imperial Consort.

===Sons===
Mehmed VI had only one son: 
* Şehzade Mehmed Ertuğrul (5 November 1912 – 2 July 1944) – with Müveddet Kadın. He never married or had children.

===Daughters===
Mehmed VI had three daughters: 
* Münire Fenire Sultan (1888 – 1888, two weeks later) – with Nazikeda Kadın. Died an infant, she is sometimes regarded as twins rather than a single princess.
* Fatma Ulviye Sultan (11 September 1892 – 1 January 1967) – with Nazikeda Kadın. Married twice, she had one daughter.
* Rukiye Sabiha Sultan (19 March 1894 – 26 August 1971) – with Nazikeda Kadın. She married Şehzade Ömer Faruk and had three daughters.

<doc id="50223" wikidata="Q902712" url="?curid=50223" title="Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency">
<text>Dirk Gently&#x27;s Holistic Detective Agency is a humorous detective novel by English writer Douglas Adams, published in 1987. It is described by the author on its cover as a &quot;thumping good detective-ghost-horror-who dunnit-time travel-romantic-musical-comedy-epic&quot;.

The book was followed by a sequel, &quot;The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul&quot;. The recurring major characters are the eponymous Dirk Gently, his secretary Janice Pearce and Sergeant Gilks. Adams began work on another novel, &quot;The Salmon of Doubt&quot;, with the intention of publishing it as the third book in the series, but died before completing it.

A BBC Radio 4 adaptation of six episodes was broadcast from October 2007. A second series based on the sequel was broadcast from October 2008. A 2010 television adaptation for BBC Four borrowed some of the characters and some minor plot elements of the novel to create a new story, and a 2016 television adaptation for BBC America served as a continuation of the books.

==Writing==
The genesis of the novel was in two &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials written by Adams, &quot;City of Death&quot; (in which an alien tries to change history at the cost of erasing humanity from existence) and in particular the cancelled serial &quot;Shada&quot;, which first introduces a Cambridge professor called Chronotis who is hundreds of years old. He has been living and working at a Cambridge college for centuries, apparently attracting no attention (noting with appreciation that the porters are very discreet). In &quot;Shada&quot;, Chronotis&#x27;s longevity is due to him being a Time Lord, and his time machine is an early model TARDIS. These trademark elements from &quot;Doctor Who&quot; were removed by Adams for &quot;Dirk Gently&quot;. &quot;Shada&quot; was cancelled before completion due to a production strike and later released on VHS with Tom Baker narrating the unfilmed segments. The story was also animated in 2017 and released on DVD.

A number of elements in the novel were inspired by Adams&#x27; time at university. For example, one plot thread involves moving a sofa which is irreversibly stuck on the staircase to Richard MacDuff&#x27;s apartment; according to his simulations, not only is it impossible to remove it, but there is no way for it to have got into that position in the first place. In a similar incident that occurred while Douglas Adams attended St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, furniture was placed in the rooms overlooking the river in Third Court while the staircases were being refurbished. When the staircases were completed, it was discovered that the sofas could no longer be removed from the rooms, and the sofas remained in those rooms for several decades.

The &quot;South Bank Show&quot; revealed that Adams based Chronotis&#x27; rooms on the rooms he occupied in his third year at university. Likewise, Richard&#x27;s room – filled with Macintosh computers and synthesisers – was based on Adams&#x27; own flat (visited and photographed by Hi-Fi Choice Magazine). The piece of music by Bach that is heard aboard the satellite is &quot;Ach bleib bei uns, Herr Jesu Christ&quot; from the cantata &quot;Bleib bei uns, denn es will Abend werden&quot;, BWV 6 (also an organ chorale BWV 649). Adams stated that this was his personal &quot;absolutely perfect&quot; piece of music, and that he listened to it &quot;over and over; drove my wife completely insane&quot; while writing &quot;Dirk Gently&#x27;s Holistic Detective Agency&quot;.

==Plot summary ==

The novel opens on a hellish, rain-drenched landscape, void of almost all life. Its sole feature is a tower-like object projecting from the omnipresent mud. The tower, for unexplained reasons, explodes. 

The narrative then switches to the perspective of an Electric Monk – a labour-saving device created for the purpose of &quot;saving you what was becoming an increasingly onerous task, that of believing all the things the world expected you to believe&quot;. This particular Monk, however, is faulty, and acquires and discards new beliefs almost at random. His alien creators have therefore abandoned him, together with his horse, in a desert. A door appears on a rock face, and the Monk goes through it. 

In Cambridge, computer programmer Richard MacDuff has arrived from London to visit his old college, the fictional St. Cedd&#x27;s, at the invitation of his undergraduate tutor Urban &quot;Reg&quot; Chronotis. Over a dinner being held in honour of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Richard explains how he came to work for Gordon Way, who also happens to be his girlfriend Susan&#x27;s brother. For the benefit of a small girl also in attendance, Reg performs a magic trick in which he vanishes a silver salt cellar from the table, only for it to reappear implanted into a two-hundred-year-old pot that the girl found on holiday in Greece. They also listen to a reading of Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;, and the narration makes reference to the poem&#x27;s &quot;second, and altogether stranger part&quot;. 

Following dinner, Richard joins Reg in his flat and the two men then discover a horse has mysteriously appeared in the bathroom. Richard suddenly recalls that he intended to bring Susan with him that evening, but completely forgot. 

While driving to his country home and leaving an extended message on Susan&#x27;s answering machine, Gordon is shot by a shadowy figure hiding in the trunk of his car. Realizing that he is dead and has become a ghost, Gordon attempts to manipulate objects around him, including his cell phone, which is still connected and transmitting. However, he accomplishes nothing other than accidentally terminating the call to Susan. 

It transpires that after going through the door, the Monk and his horse found themselves in Reg&#x27;s flat. Whilst wandering the college grounds, the Monk encountered a porter who told him to &quot;shoot off&quot;. Desiring to follow the instruction, the Monk hid in the trunk of Gordon&#x27;s car when Gordon stopped for fuel. Not understanding Gordon&#x27;s &quot;reaction&quot; to being shot – i.e., dying – and concerned that he might have erred, the Monk takes Gordon&#x27;s identification, keys, and body to the country house before leaving in pursuit of another unshakeable belief. His odd behavior eventually causes him to be picked up by the police.

Richard also leaves a message on Susan&#x27;s answering machine, desperately apologizing and rashly promising to go on holiday with her that weekend. He realizes that with a work deadline looming, he will not be able to fulfill this promise. He then decides to break into Susan&#x27;s flat and remove the tape from her answering machine. After he enters through the window, the phone rings. The caller is a man Richard knew at Cambridge as the eccentric Dirk Cjelli, now using the surname Gently to avoid troubles with the law. Having seen Richard commit his attempted burglary, Dirk instructs Richard to meet him at a pizza restaurant in a few minutes and hangs up. 

Richard is suddenly seized by remorse and returns the tape to the machine. Immediately afterward, Susan arrives home in the company of her acquaintance Michael Wenton-Weakes. Michael, the son of a wealthy publishing magnate, was unceremoniously terminated from his position as editor of the magazine &quot;Fathom&quot; following his father&#x27;s death; he is bitterly resentful of his successor, Alistair Ross. After Michael leaves, Richard apologizes to Susan, who forgives him. She also hands him the tape from the answering machine without listening to it, asking him to give it to Gordon’s secretary for transcription. 

The next day, having failed to make their appointment at the pizza restaurant, Richard looks up Dirk in the phone book and discovers an ad for Dirk Gently&#x27;s Holistic Detective Agency. He goes to the agency&#x27;s office, where Dirk explains that his detective methods are based on the &quot;fundamental interconnectedness of all things&quot;. Dirk then informs his friend that Gordon is dead under mysterious circumstances, and persuades Richard to be hypnotized and describe the events of his evening. Dirk is particularly concerned about the magic trick, which is, so far as he can tell, utterly impossible, as well as Richard&#x27;s highly uncharacteristic decision to break into Susan&#x27;s flat. He believes that there must be a connection between all the odd events revolving around Richard.

The pair go to Cambridge to speak with Reg. When asked about the trick, the professor confesses his secret: he is not human, but a being so old that he has forgotten his own origins. His flat is in fact a craft of extraordinary power which can travel through space and time – though, for some reason, it cannot function when Reg&#x27;s telephone is working, and vice versa. To perform the trick, Reg travelled back in time to have the man who made the pot bake the salt cellar into it. He also visited the planet where the Monk originated, to collect a particular kind of dust that worked well to conceal the suntan he acquired while looking for the potter; the Monk went through the time machine&#x27;s door while Reg was not looking. The professor acknowledges this is out of character for him – normally he refuses to change the past, for fear of causing a catastrophe in the timeline.

Michael also arrives in Cambridge to ask Reg&#x27;s assistance. He is possessed by the ghost of an alien engineer, whose crew had left their own war-torn planet in search of another world on which to build a utopia based around the creation of music. When the aliens, known as Salaxalans, arrived on Earth four billion years in the past to refuel and repair their ship, the engineer failed to notice a problem in the engines of their landing craft. When they were started, the craft exploded, killing the entire crew and leaving their deserted mothership still in orbit. The ghost, haunted by guilt, has spent the millennia trying to find a way to set this right. To this end, he has possessed a number of individuals, including Coleridge, whose work was influenced by the ghost&#x27;s story. The curious actions of Richard, Reg, and even the Electric Monk were also caused by the ghost possessing them. Each subject ultimately proved unsuitable for the task. The engineer finally succeeded with Michael, who is implied to be sympathetic to the ghost&#x27;s goals due to his fondness for Coleridge&#x27;s poetry, particularly the second half of &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;. Dirk demands proof of these claims, so Reg takes them to the mothership, where Richard is overcome by the beauty of the Salaxalans&#x27; music. Richard, Dirk, and Reg agree to take Michael and the ghost back to the scene of the accident. 

Gordon realizes that he will only be able to end his ghosthood if he completes his unfinished business – namely, leaving a message on Susan&#x27;s answering machine – but struggles to muster the emotional energy he needs to lift a phone&#x27;s receiver and dial the number. While drifting around London, he stumbles across the scene of a murder. Galvanized by this discovery, he uses the touch-tone phone in Dirk&#x27;s office to call his sister, records an answering machine message telling her of the crime, and hangs up, which enables him to &quot;[fall] back to his own rest and vanish&quot;. 

After Michael, using scuba gear, has walked into the poisonous atmosphere of pre-organic Earth, Richard receives a phone call from Susan. She listened to Gordon&#x27;s message, which informed her that Alistair Ross was the murder victim. Richard realizes that the ghost had lied to him and the others. The aliens were intending to colonize Earth, but the accident robbed them of the opportunity, and the Salaxalan regards humanity and indeed all life on the planet as usurpers. Michael is an acceptable host because he considered Ross a usurper, and Ross&#x27;s murder was the final test of his willingness to go to extremes to &quot;fix&quot; the mistake. 

To stop the engineer from preventing the accident, without which life on Earth could not begin, Richard, Reg, and Dirk travel to Somerset in 1797. Dirk, pretending to be the &quot;person from Porlock&quot;, interrupts Coleridge at work. This action prevents the poem (containing the necessary information on how to repair the ship) being finished and severs the critical link between Michael and the ghost. Reg retains some pity for the engineer, and so travels back to the accident once more. He transports the crew off the landing craft just before the explosion and brings them to the mothership, enabling them to continue on their quest elsewhere.

The three men return to the present day. Reg finds the Electric Monk and takes him back to his own planet. Richard discovers Susan playing a cello piece that is hauntingly reminiscent of the Salaxalans&#x27; harmonies and is baffled when she tells him it was composed by someone called &quot;Bach&quot;. Reg admits that he recorded a portion of the Salaxalans&#x27; music and gave it to the composer. Richard begs him to go back to the mothership and retrieve more, but Reg says this will not be possible – a man from British Telecom has come and fixed the phone.

==Literary significance and reception==
Reviewing the book for &quot;The Times&quot;, John Nicholson wrote it was &quot;endearingly dotty&quot;, but doubted its commercial potential. Austin MacCurtain of the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; reviewed the paperback edition in 1988, saying that it was &quot;more of the same&quot; as &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot;, and that the &quot;cosmic romp is stretched thin at times but will not disappoint fans&quot;. The book was the 9th highest-selling hardback in the UK in 1987.

J. Michael Caparula reviewed &quot;Dirk Gently&#x27;s Holistic Detective Agency&quot; in &quot;Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer&quot; No. 84. Caparula commented that &quot;The writing is wry and quite British, and the novel&#x27;s quirky spirit is reminiscent of Rudy Rucker&#x27;s mathematical farces. A nice change for Adams, proof that his talent goes far beyond the meandering &quot;Hitchhiker&quot; saga.&quot;

In 1990, the Magill Book Reviews said &quot;The author&#x27;s whimsical sense of humor and his sense that the universe has many unexplored possibilities will arouse the interest of a wide readership.&quot;

This novel caused Adams to become acquainted with the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins. As Dawkins explains, &quot;As soon as I finished it, I turned back to page one and read it straight through again – the only time I have ever done that, and I wrote to tell him so. He replied that he was a fan of my books, and he invited me to his house in London.&quot; Adams would later introduce Dawkins to the woman who was to become his third wife, the actress Lalla Ward, best known for playing the character Romana in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. One of her early serials on the programme was &quot;City of Death&quot;, which Adams wrote, and which shares certain plot elements with the novel.

==Adaptations==
On 5 January 1992, Dirk Gently, Richard MacDuff, Dirk&#x27;s secretary, and the Electric Monk all appeared in the Douglas Adams episode of the British arts documentary series &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;. Michael Bywater played Dirk, while Paul Shearer played both Richard and the Monk. Several characters from &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; were also featured, played by the original television series actors.

The book has been adapted for stage performance as &quot;Dirk&quot; and in 2005, some fans of Douglas Adams produced an amateur radio series based on the first book. Their efforts began and were coordinated on the Douglas Adams Continuum website. Three episodes were completed. Apart from the radio broadcasts, Douglas Adams recorded both unabridged and abridged readings of the first novel for the audiobook market.

===Radio===
Announced on 26 January 2007, BBC Radio 4 commissioned Above the Title Productions to make eighteen 30-minute adaptations of Douglas Adams&#x27; &quot;Dirk Gently&quot; books (including &quot;The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul&quot; and the unfinished &quot;The Salmon of Doubt&quot;), running in three series of six episodes.

The first series began on 3 October 2007 and features Harry Enfield as Dirk, Billy Boyd as Richard, Olivia Colman as Janice, Jim Carter as Gilks, Andrew Sachs as Reg, Felicity Montagu as Susan, Robert Duncan as Gordon, Toby Longworth as the Monk, Michael Fenton Stevens as Michael, Andrew Secombe, Jon Glover, Jeffrey Holland, Wayne Forester and Tamsin Heatley.

The script for &quot;Dirk Gently&#x27;s Holistic Detective Agency&quot; was written by Dirk Maggs, who also directs, and John Langdon. The show was produced by Maggs and Jo Wheeler. As with the previous &quot;Hitchhiker&quot;″s series, the CD version features greatly expanded episodes. There are a number of structural and detail differences between the radio adaptation and the book, mostly to aid the comprehension of the story when split into six half-hour episodes.

Dirk Maggs parted ways with Above the Title Productions when he started his own production company, Perfectly Normal Productions, and so the project was never completed and the proposed radio series of &quot;The Salmon of Doubt&quot; remains unmade.

===Comic book===
Cartoonist Ray Friesen made an unlicensed comic adaptation of the first novel for a book report. A few years later, in 2004, he posted 18 pages of it online as a webcomic.

IDW Entertainment and Ideate Media have adapted &quot;Dirk Gently&quot; into a limited comic book series and, later, an American television series for BBC America. The comic series premiered in May 2015.

===Television===

There have been two television series based on Dirk Gently books and characters.

The first series, &quot;Dirk Gently&quot;, featuring the character was announced during Hitchcon, a 2009 &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; event to launch the sixth &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; book. Ed Victor, a literary agent who represents Adams&#x27; estate, announced that a television adaptation of &quot;Dirk Gently&#x27;s Holistic Detective Agency&quot; was in production. Stephen Mangan played Gently, with Darren Boyd as Macduff and Helen Baxendale as Susan. It was broadcast on BBC Four on 16 December 2010. The hour-long pilot was well-received, leading to three further episodes being commissioned. These aired on BBC4 during March 2012.

A second series, &quot;Dirk Gently&#x27;s Holistic Detective Agency&quot; was released in January 2016. BBC America produced 18 episodes starring Samuel Barnett as Dirk Gently, Elijah Wood as Todd Brotzman, Hannah Marks as Amanda Brotzman, and Jade Eshete as Farah Black. As of July 2020 it is available on the Hulu streaming service.

<text>A prime meridian is an arbitrarily chosen meridian (a line of longitude) in a geographic coordinate system at which longitude is defined to be 0°. On a spheroid, a prime meridian and its anti-meridian (the 180th meridian in a 360°-system) form a great ellipse. This divides the body (e.g. Earth) into two hemispheres: the Eastern Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere (for an east-west notational system). For Earth&#x27;s prime meridian, various conventions have been used or advocated in different regions throughout history. Earth&#x27;s current international standard prime meridian is the IERS Reference Meridian. It is derived, but differs slightly, from the Greenwich Meridian, the previous standard.

A prime meridian for a planetary body not tidally locked (or at least not in synchronous rotation) is entirely arbitrary, unlike an equator, which is determined by the axis of rotation. However, for celestial objects that are tidally locked (more specifically, synchronous), their prime meridians are determined by the face always inward of the orbit (a planet facing its star, or a moon facing its planet), just as equators are determined by rotation.

Longitudes for the Earth and Moon are measured from their prime meridian (at 0°) to 180° east and west. For all other Solar System bodies, longitude is measured from 0° (their prime meridian) to 360°. West longitudes are used if the rotation of the body is prograde (or &#x27;direct&#x27;, like Earth), meaning that its direction of rotation is the same as that of its orbit. East longitudes are used if the rotation is retrograde.

== History ==


The notion of longitude for Greeks was developed by the Greek Eratosthenes (c.276195BCE) in Alexandria, and Hipparchus (c.190120BCE) in Rhodes, and applied to a large number of cities by the geographer Strabo (64/63BCEc.24CE). But it was Ptolemy (c.90168CE) who first used a consistent meridian for a world map in his &quot;Geographia&quot;.

Ptolemy used as his basis the &quot;Fortunate Isles&quot;, a group of islands in the Atlantic, which are usually associated with the Canary Islands (13° to 18°W), although his maps correspond more closely to the Cape Verde islands (22° to 25° W). The main point is to be comfortably west of the western tip of Africa (17.5° W) as negative numbers were not yet in use. His prime meridian corresponds to 18° 40&#x27; west of Winchester (about 20°W) today. At that time the chief method of determining longitude was by using the reported times of lunar eclipses in different countries.

One of the earliest known descriptions of &quot;standard time&quot; in India appeared in the 4th century CE astronomical treatise Surya Siddhanta. Postulating a spherical Earth, the book described the thousands years old customs of the prime meridian, or zero longitude, as passing through &quot;Avanti&quot;, the ancient name for the historic city of Ujjain, and &quot;Rohitaka&quot;, the ancient name for Rohtak (), a city near the Kurukshetra.
Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geographia&quot; was first printed with maps at Bologna in 1477, and many early globes in the 16th century followed his lead. But there was still a hope that a &quot;natural&quot; basis for a prime meridian existed. Christopher Columbus reported (1493) that the compass pointed due north somewhere in mid-Atlantic, and this fact was used in the important Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494, which settled the territorial dispute between Spain and Portugal over newly discovered lands. The Tordesillas line was eventually settled at 370 leagues (2,193 kilometers, 1,362 statute miles, or 1,184 nautical miles) west of Cape Verde. This is shown in the copies of Spain&#x27;s Padron Real made by Diogo Ribeiro in 1527 and 1529. São Miguel Island (25.5°W) in the Azores was still used for the same reason as late as 1594 by Christopher Saxton, although by then it had been shown that the zero magnetic declination line did not follow a line of longitude.

In 1541, Mercator produced his famous 41 cm terrestrial globe and drew his prime meridian precisely through Fuerteventura (14°1&#x27;W) in the Canaries. His later maps used the Azores, following the magnetic hypothesis. But by the time that Ortelius produced the first modern atlas in 1570, other islands such as Cape Verde were coming into use. In his atlas longitudes were counted from 0° to 360°, not 180°W to 180°E as is usual today. This practice was followed by navigators well into the 18th century. In 1634, Cardinal Richelieu used the westernmost island of the Canaries, El Hierro, 19° 55&#x27; west of Paris, as the choice of meridian. The geographer Delisle decided to round this off to 20°, so that it simply became the meridian of Paris disguised.

In the early 18th century the battle was on to improve the determination of longitude at sea, leading to the development of the marine chronometer by John Harrison. But it was the development of accurate star charts, principally by the first British Astronomer Royal, John Flamsteed between 1680 and 1719 and disseminated by his successor Edmund Halley, that enabled navigators to use the lunar method of determining longitude more accurately using the octant developed by Thomas Godfrey and John Hadley.

In the 18th century most countries in Europe adapted their own &quot;prime&quot; meridian, usually through their capital, hence in France the Paris meridian was prime, in Prussia it was the Berlin meridian, in Denmark the Copenhagen meridian, and in United Kingdom the Greenwich meridian.

Between 1765 and 1811, Nevil Maskelyne published 49 issues of the &quot;Nautical Almanac&quot; based on the meridian of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. &quot;Maskelyne&#x27;s tables not only made the lunar method practicable, they also made the Greenwich meridian the universal reference point. Even the French translations of the &quot;Nautical Almanac&quot; retained Maskelyne&#x27;s calculations from Greenwich – in spite of the fact that every other table in the &quot;Connaissance des Temps&quot; considered the Paris meridian as the prime.&quot;

In 1884, at the International Meridian Conference in Washington, D.C., 22 countries voted to adopt the Greenwich meridian as the prime meridian of the world. The French argued for a neutral line, mentioning the Azores and the Bering Strait, but eventually abstained and continued to use the Paris meridian until 1911.

The current international standard Prime Meridian is the IERS Reference Meridian. The International Hydrographic Organization adopted an early version of the IRM in 1983 for all nautical charts. It was adopted for air navigation by the International Civil Aviation Organization on 3 March 1989.

==International prime meridian==
Since 1984, the international standard for the Earth&#x27;s prime meridian is the IERS Reference Meridian. Between 1884 and 1984, the meridian of Greenwich was the world standard. These meridians are very close to each other.

===Prime meridian at Greenwich===
In October 1884 the Greenwich Meridian was selected by delegates (forty-one delegates representing twenty-five nations) to the International Meridian Conference held in Washington, D.C., United States to be the common zero of longitude and standard of time reckoning throughout the world.

The position of the historic prime meridian, based at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, was established by Sir George Airy in 1851. It was defined by the location of the Airy Transit Circle ever since the first observation he took with it. Prior to that, it was defined by a succession of earlier transit instruments, the first of which was acquired by the second Astronomer Royal, Edmond Halley in 1721. It was set up in the extreme north-west corner of the Observatory between Flamsteed House and the Western Summer House. This spot, now subsumed into Flamsteed House, is roughly 43 metres (47 yards) to the west of the Airy Transit Circle, a distance equivalent to roughly 2 seconds of longitude. It was Airy&#x27;s transit circle that was adopted in principle (with French delegates, who pressed for adoption of the Paris meridian abstaining) as the Prime Meridian of the world at the 1884 International Meridian Conference.

All of these Greenwich meridians were located via an astronomic observation from the surface of the Earth, oriented via a plumb line along the direction of gravity at the surface. This astronomic Greenwich meridian was disseminated around the world, first via the lunar distance method, then by chronometers carried on ships, then via telegraph lines carried by submarine communications cables, then via radio time signals. One remote longitude ultimately based on the Greenwich meridian using these methods was that of the North American Datum 1927 or NAD27, an ellipsoid whose surface best matches mean sea level under the United States.

===IERS Reference Meridian===
Beginning in 1973 the International Time Bureau and later the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service changed from reliance on optical instruments like the Airy Transit Circle to techniques such as lunar laser ranging, satellite laser ranging, and very-long-baseline interferometry. The new techniques resulted in the IERS Reference Meridian, the plane of which passes through the centre of mass of the Earth. This differs from the plane established by the Airy transit, which is affected by vertical deflection (the local vertical is affected by influences such as nearby mountains). The change from relying on the local vertical to using a meridian based on the centre of the Earth caused the modern prime meridian to be 5.3 east of the astronomic Greenwich prime meridian through the Airy Transit Circle. At the latitude of Greenwich, this amounts to 102 metres (112 yards). This was officially accepted by the Bureau International de l&#x27;Heure (BIH) in 1984 via its BTS84 (BIH Terrestrial System) that later became WGS84 (World Geodetic System 1984) and the various International Terrestrial Reference Frames (ITRFs).

Due to the movement of Earth&#x27;s tectonic plates, the line of 0° longitude along the surface of the Earth has slowly moved toward the west from this shifted position by a few centimetres (inches); that is, towards the Airy Transit Circle (or the Airy Transit Circle has moved toward the east, depending on your point of view) since 1984 (or the 1960s). With the introduction of satellite technology, it became possible to create a more accurate and detailed global map. With these advances there also arose the necessity to define a reference meridian that, whilst being derived from the Airy Transit Circle, would also take into account the effects of plate movement and variations in the way that the Earth was spinning.
As a result, the IERS Reference Meridian was established and is commonly used to denote the Earth&#x27;s prime meridian (0° longitude) by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service, which defines and maintains the link between longitude and time. Based on observations to satellites and celestial compact radio sources (quasars) from various coordinated stations around the globe, Airy&#x27;s transit circle drifts northeast about 2.5 centimetres (1 inch) per year relative to this Earth-centred 0° longitude.

It is also the reference meridian of the Global Positioning System operated by the United States Department of Defense, and of WGS84 and its two formal versions, the ideal International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) and its realization, the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF). A current convention on the Earth uses the line of longitude 180° opposite the IRM as the basis for the International Date Line.

On Earth, starting at the North Pole and heading south to the South Pole, the IERS Reference Meridian (as of 2016) passes through 8 countries, 4 seas, 3 oceans and 1 channel:


==Prime meridian on other celestial bodies==

As on the Earth, prime meridians must be arbitrarily defined. Often a landmark such as a crater is used; other times a prime meridian is defined by reference to another celestial object, or by magnetic fields. 
The prime meridians of the following planetographic systems have been defined:

* Two different heliographic coordinate systems are used on the Sun. The first is the Carrington heliographic coordinate system. In this system, the prime meridian passes through the center of the solar disk as seen from the Earth on 9 November 1853, which is when the English astronomer Richard Christopher Carrington started his observations of sunspots. The second is the Stonyhurst heliographic coordinates system, originated at Stonyhurst Observatory in Lancashire, England.
* In 1975 the prime meridian of Mercury was defined to be 20° east of the crater Hun Kal. This meridian was chosen because it runs through the point on Mercury&#x27;s equator where the average temperature is highest (due to the planet&#x27;s rotation and orbit, the sun briefly retrogrades at noon at this point during perihelion, giving it more sunlight).
* Defined in 1992, the prime meridian of Venus passes through the central peak in the crater Ariadne, chosen arbitrarily.
* The prime meridian of the Moon lies directly in the middle of the face of the Moon visible from Earth and passes near the crater Bruce.
* The prime meridian of Mars was established in 1971 and passes through the center of the crater Airy-0, although it is fixed by the longitude of the &quot;Viking 1&quot; lander, which is defined to be 47.95137°W.
*The prime meridian on Ceres runs through the Kait crater, which was arbitrarily chosen because it is near the equator (about 2° south).
*The prime meridian on 4 Vesta is 4 degrees east of the crater Claudia, chosen because it is sharply defined.
*Jupiter has several coordinate systems because its cloud tops—the only part of the planet visible from space—rotate at different rates depending on latitude. It is unknown whether Jupiter has any internal solid surface that would enable a more Earth-like coordinate system. System I and System II coordinates are based on atmospheric rotation, and System III coordinates use Jupiter&#x27;s magnetic field. The prime meridians of Jupiter&#x27;s four Galilean moons were established in 1979.
**Europa&#x27;s prime meridian is defined such that the crater Cilix is at 182° W. The 0° longitude runs through the middle of the face that is always turned towards Jupiter.
**Io&#x27;s prime meridian, like that of Earth&#x27;s moon, is defined so that it runs through the middle of the face that is always turned towards Jupiter (the near side, known as the subjovian hemisphere).
**Ganymede&#x27;s prime meridian is defined such that the crater Anat is at 128° W, and the 0° longitude runs through the middle of the subjovian hemisphere.
**Callisto&#x27;s prime meridian is defined such that the crater Saga is at 326° W.
*Titan is the largest moon of Saturn and, like the Earth&#x27;s moon, always has the same face towards Saturn, and so the middle of that face is 0 longitude.
*Like Jupiter, Neptune is a gas giant, so any surface is obscured by clouds. The prime meridian of its largest moon, Triton, was established in 1991.
*Pluto&#x27;s prime meridian is defined as the meridian passing through the center of the face that is always towards Charon, its largest moon, as the two are tidally locked to each other. Charon&#x27;s prime meridian is similarly defined as the meridian always facing directly toward Pluto.
