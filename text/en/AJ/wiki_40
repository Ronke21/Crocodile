<text>Instrumentation is a collective term for measuring instruments, used for indicating, measuring, and recording physical quantities. It is also a field of study about the art and science about making measurement instruments, involving the related areas of metrology, automation, and control theory. The term has its origins in the art and science of scientific instrument-making.

Instrumentation can refer to devices as simple as direct-reading thermometers, or as complex as multi-sensor components of industrial control systems. Instruments can be found in laboratories, refineries, factories and vehicles, as well as in everyday household use (e.g., smoke detectors and thermostats).

== Measurement parameters==

Instrumentation is used to measure many parameters (physical values), including:
*Pressure, either differential or static
*Flow
*Temperature
*Levels of liquids, etc.
*Moisture or humidity 
*Density
*Viscosity
*ionising radiation
*Frequency
*Current
*Voltage
*Inductance
*Capacitance
*Resistivity
*Chemical composition
*Chemical properties
**Toxic gases
*Position
*Vibration
*Weight

== History ==
The history of instrumentation can be divided into several phases.

===Pre-industrial===
Elements of industrial instrumentation have long histories. Scales for comparing weights and simple pointers to indicate position are ancient technologies. Some of the earliest measurements were of time. One of the oldest water clocks was found in the tomb of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep I, buried around 1500 BCE. Improvements were incorporated in the clocks. By 270 BCE they had the rudiments of an automatic control system device.

In 1663 Christopher Wren presented the Royal Society with a design for a &quot;weather clock&quot;. A drawing shows meteorological sensors moving pens over paper driven by clockwork. Such devices did not become standard in meteorology for two centuries. The concept has remained virtually unchanged as evidenced by pneumatic chart recorders, where a pressurized bellows displaces a pen. Integrating sensors, displays, recorders, and controls was uncommon until the industrial revolution, limited by both need and practicality.

===Early industrial===

Early systems used direct process connections to local control panels for control and indication, which from the early 1930s saw the introduction of pneumatic transmitters and automatic 3-term (PID) controllers.

The ranges of pneumatic transmitters were defined by the need to control valves and actuators in the field. Typically, a signal ranged from 3 to 15 psi (20 to 100kPa or 0.2 to 1.0 kg/cm2) as a standard, was standardized with 6 to 30 psi occasionally being used for larger valves. 
Transistor electronics enabled wiring to replace pipes, initially with a range of 20 to 100mA at up to 90V for loop powered devices, reducing to 4 to 20mA at 12 to 24V in more modern systems. A transmitter is a device that produces an output signal, often in the form of a 4–20 mA electrical current signal, although many other options using voltage, frequency, pressure, or ethernet are possible. The transistor was commercialized by the mid-1950s.

Instruments attached to a control system provided signals used to operate solenoids, valves, regulators, circuit breakers, relays and other devices. Such devices could control a desired output variable, and provide either remote monitoring or automated control capabilities.

Each instrument company introduced their own standard instrumentation signal, causing confusion until the 4–20 mA range was used as the standard electronic instrument signal for transmitters and valves. This signal was eventually standardized as ANSI/ISA S50, &quot;Compatibility of Analog Signals for Electronic Industrial Process Instruments&quot;, in the 1970s. The transformation of instrumentation from mechanical pneumatic transmitters, controllers, and valves to electronic instruments reduced maintenance costs as electronic instruments were more dependable than mechanical instruments. This also increased efficiency and production due to their increase in accuracy. Pneumatics enjoyed some advantages, being favored in corrosive and explosive atmospheres.

===Automatic process control===

In the early years of process control, process indicators and control elements such as valves were monitored by an operator, that walked around the unit adjusting the valves to obtain the desired temperatures, pressures, and flows. As technology evolved pneumatic controllers were invented and mounted in the field that monitored the process and controlled the valves. This reduced the amount of time process operators needed to monitor the process. Latter years, the actual controllers were moved to a central room and signals were sent into the control room to monitor the process and outputs signals were sent to the final control element such as a valve to adjust the process as needed. These controllers and indicators were mounted on a wall called a control board. The operators stood in front of this board walking back and forth monitoring the process indicators. This again reduced the number and amount of time process operators were needed to walk around the units. The most standard pneumatic signal level used during these years was 3–15 psig.

===Large integrated computer-based systems===

Process control of large industrial plants has evolved through many stages. Initially, control would be from panels local to the process plant. However, this required a large manpower resource to attend to these dispersed panels, and there was no overall view of the process. The next logical development was the transmission of all plant measurements to a permanently staffed central control room. Effectively this was the centralization of all the localized panels, with the advantages of lower manning levels and easy overview of the process. Often the controllers were behind the control room panels, and all automatic and manual control outputs were transmitted back to plant.

However, whilst providing a central control focus, this arrangement was inflexible as each control loop had its own controller hardware, and continual operator movement within the control room was required to view different parts of the process. With coming of electronic processors and graphic displays it became possible to replace these discrete controllers with computer-based algorithms, hosted on a network of input/output racks with their own control processors. These could be distributed around plant, and communicate with the graphic display in the control room or rooms. The distributed control concept was born.

The introduction of DCSs and SCADA allowed easy interconnection and re-configuration of plant controls such as cascaded loops and interlocks, and easy interfacing with other production computer systems. It enabled sophisticated alarm handling, introduced automatic event logging, removed the need for physical records such as chart recorders, allowed the control racks to be networked and thereby located locally to plant to reduce cabling runs, and provided high level overviews of plant status and production levels.

== Application ==
In some cases, the sensor is a very minor element of the mechanism. Digital cameras and wristwatches might technically meet the loose definition of instrumentation because they record and/or display sensed information. Under most circumstances neither would be called instrumentation, but when used to measure the elapsed time of a race and to document the winner at the finish line, both would be called instrumentation.

===Household===
A very simple example of an instrumentation system is a mechanical thermostat, used to control a household furnace and thus to control room temperature. A typical unit senses temperature with a bi-metallic strip. It displays temperature by a needle on the free end of the strip. It activates the furnace by a mercury switch. As the switch is rotated by the strip, the mercury makes physical (and thus electrical) contact between electrodes.

Another example of an instrumentation system is a home security system. Such a system consists of 
sensors (motion detection, switches to detect door openings), simple algorithms to detect intrusion, local control (arm/disarm) and remote monitoring of the system so that the police can be summoned. Communication is an inherent part of the design.

Kitchen appliances use sensors for control.
*A refrigerator maintains a constant temperature by actuating the cooling system when the temperature becomes too high.
*An automatic ice machine makes ice until a limit switch is thrown.
*Pop-up bread toasters allow the time to be set.
*Non-electronic gas ovens will regulate the temperature with a thermostat controlling the flow of gas to the gas burner. These may feature a sensor bulb sited within the main chamber of the oven. In addition, there may be a safety cut-off flame supervision device: after ignition, the burner&#x27;s control knob must be held for a short time in order for a sensor to become hot, and permit the flow of gas to the burner. If the safety sensor becomes cold, this may indicate the flame on the burner has become extinguished, and to prevent a continuous leak of gas the flow is stopped.
*Electric ovens use a temperature sensor and will turn on heating elements when the temperature is too low. More advanced ovens will actuate fans in response to temperature sensors, to distribute heat or to cool.
*A common toilet refills the water tank until a float closes the valve. The float is acting as a water level sensor.

===Automotive===
Modern automobiles have complex instrumentation. In addition to displays of engine rotational speed and vehicle linear speed, there are also displays of battery voltage and current, fluid levels, fluid temperatures, distance traveled, and feedback of various controls (turn signals, parking brake, headlights, transmission position). Cautions may be displayed for special problems (fuel low, check engine, tire pressure low, door ajar, seat belt unfastened). Problems are recorded so they can be reported to diagnostic equipment. Navigation systems can provide voice commands to reach a destination. Automotive instrumentation must be cheap and reliable over long periods in harsh environments. There may be independent airbag systems that contain sensors, logic and actuators. Anti-skid braking systems use sensors to control the brakes, while cruise control affects throttle position. A wide variety of services can be provided via communication links on the OnStar system. Autonomous cars (with exotic instrumentation) have been shown.

===Aircraft===
Early aircraft had a few sensors. &quot;Steam gauges&quot; converted air pressures into needle deflections that could be interpreted as altitude and airspeed. A magnetic compass provided a sense of direction. The displays to the pilot were as critical as the measurements.

A modern aircraft has a far more sophisticated suite of sensors and displays, which are embedded into avionics systems. The aircraft may contain inertial navigation systems, global positioning systems, weather radar, autopilots, and aircraft stabilization systems. Redundant sensors are used for reliability. A subset of the information may be transferred to a crash recorder to aid mishap investigations. Modern pilot displays now include computer displays including head-up displays.

Air traffic control radar is a distributed instrumentation system. The ground part sends an electromagnetic pulse and receives an echo (at least). Aircraft carry transponders that transmit codes on reception of the pulse. The system displays an aircraft map location, an identifier and optionally altitude. The map location is based on sensed antenna direction and sensed time delay. The other information is embedded in the transponder transmission.

===Laboratory instrumentation===
Among the possible uses of the term is a collection of laboratory test equipment controlled by a computer through an IEEE-488 bus (also known as GPIB for General Purpose Instrument Bus or HPIB for Hewlitt Packard Instrument Bus). Laboratory equipment is available to measure many electrical and chemical quantities. Such a collection of equipment might be used to automate the testing of drinking water for pollutants.

== Instrumentation engineering ==

Instrumentation engineering is the engineering specialization focused on the principle and operation of measuring instruments that are used in design and configuration of automated systems in areas such as electrical and pneumatic domains, and the control of quantities being measured.
They typically work for industries with automated processes, such as chemical or manufacturing plants, with the goal of improving system productivity, reliability, safety, optimization and stability.
To control the parameters in a process or in a particular system, devices such as microprocessors, microcontrollers or PLCs are used, but their ultimate aim is to control the parameters of a system.

Instrumentation engineering is loosely defined because the required tasks are very domain dependent. An expert in the biomedical instrumentation of laboratory rats has very different concerns than the expert in rocket instrumentation. Common concerns of both are the selection of appropriate sensors based on size, weight, cost, reliability, accuracy, longevity, environmental robustness, and frequency response. Some sensors are literally fired in artillery shells. Others sense thermonuclear explosions until destroyed. Invariably sensor data must be recorded, transmitted or displayed. Recording rates and capacities vary enormously. Transmission can be trivial or can be clandestine, encrypted and low power in the presence of jamming. Displays can be trivially simple or can require consultation with human factors experts. Control system design varies from trivial to a separate specialty.

Instrumentation engineers are responsible for integrating the sensors with the recorders, transmitters, displays or control systems, and producing the Piping and instrumentation diagram for the process. They may design or specify installation, wiring and signal conditioning. They may be responsible for commissioning, calibration, testing and maintenance of the system.

In a research environment it is common for subject matter experts to have substantial instrumentation system expertise. An astronomer knows the structure of the universe and a great deal about telescopes – optics, pointing and cameras (or other sensing elements). That often includes the hard-won knowledge of the operational procedures that provide the best results. For example, an astronomer is often knowledgeable of techniques to minimize temperature gradients that cause air turbulence within the telescope.

Instrumentation technologists, technicians and mechanics specialize in troubleshooting, repairing and maintaining instruments and instrumentation systems.

=== Typical industrial transmitter signal types ===
*Pneumatic loop (20-100KPa/3-15PSI) – Pneumatic
*Current loop (4-20mA) – Electrical
*HART – Data signalling, often overlaid on a current loop
*Foundation Fieldbus – Data signalling
*Profibus – Data signalling

==Impact of modern development==
Ralph Müller (1940) stated, &quot;That the history of physical science is largely the history of instruments and their intelligent use is well known. The broad generalizations and theories which have arisen from time to time have stood or fallen on the basis of accurate measurement, and in several instances new instruments have had to be devised for the purpose. There is little evidence to show that the mind of modern man is superior to that of the ancients. His tools are incomparably better.&quot;

Davis Baird has argued that the major change associated with Floris Cohen″s identification of a &quot;fourth big scientific revolution&quot; after World War II is the development of scientific instrumentation, not only in chemistry but across the sciences. In chemistry, the introduction of new instrumentation in the 1940s was &quot;nothing less than a scientific and technological revolution&quot; in which classical wet-and-dry methods of structural organic chemistry were discarded, and new areas of research opened up.

As early as 1954, W. A. Wildhack discussed both the productive and destructive potential inherent in process control.
The ability to make precise, verifiable and reproducible measurements of the natural world, at levels that were not previously observable, using scientific instrumentation, has &quot;provided a different texture of the world&quot;. This instrumentation revolution fundamentally changes human abilities to monitor and respond, as is illustrated in the examples of DDT monitoring and the use of UV spectrophotometry and gas chromatography to monitor water pollutants.

<doc id="47404" wikidata="Q57126" url="?curid=47404" title="Anne of Cleves">
<text>Anne of Cleves (; 28 June or 22 September 1515 – 16 July 1557) was Queen of England from 6 January to 12 July 1540 as the fourth wife of Henry VIII. Little is known about Anne before 1527, when she became betrothed to Francis, Duke of Bar, son and heir of Antoine, Duke of Lorraine, although their marriage did not proceed.

In March 1539, negotiations for Anne&#x27;s marriage to Henry began. Henry believed he needed to form a political alliance with her brother, William, a leader of the Protestants of Western Germany, to strengthen his position against potential attacks from Catholic France and the Holy Roman Empire. Anne arrived in England in December 1539 and married Henry a week later, but the marriage was declared unconsummated after six months and Anne was not crowned queen consort.

Following the annulment, Henry gave her a generous settlement and Anne was thereafter known as &quot;the King&#x27;s Beloved Sister&quot;. Remaining in England, she lived to see the reigns of Henry&#x27;s children Edward VI and Mary I and attended Mary&#x27;s coronation in 1553. Anne outlived the rest of Henry&#x27;s wives.

==Early life==
Anne was born in 1515, on either 22 September or 28 June. She was born in Düsseldorf, Duchy of Berg, the second daughter of John III of the House of La Marck, Duke of Jülich &quot;jure uxoris&quot;, Cleves, Berg &quot;jure uxoris&quot;, Count of Mark, also known as de la Marck and Ravensberg &quot;jure uxoris&quot; (often referred to as Duke of Cleves) who died in 1538, and his wife Maria, Duchess of Jülich-Berg (1491–1543). She grew up in Schloss Burg on the edge of Solingen.

Anne&#x27;s father was influenced by Erasmus and followed a moderate path within the Reformation. He decided to side with the Schmalkaldic League and opposed Emperor Charles V. After John&#x27;s death, Anne&#x27;s brother William became Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, bearing the promising epithet &quot;The Rich&quot;. In 1526, her elder sister Sibylle was married to John Frederick, Elector of Saxony, head of the Protestant Confederation of Germany and considered the &quot;Champion of the Reformation.&quot;

In 1527, at the age of 11, Anne was betrothed to Francis, the 9-year-old son and heir of Antoine, Duke of Lorraine. But because Francis was under the age of consent (10 years old) at the time of the arrangement, the betrothal was considered unofficial and was cancelled in 1535. Her brother William was a Lutheran but the family was unaligned religiously, with her mother, the Duchess Maria, described as a &quot;strict Catholic&quot;. Her father&#x27;s ongoing dispute over the Duchy of Guelders with Charles V made the family suitable allies for England&#x27;s King Henry VIII in the wake of the Truce of Nice. The match with Anne was urged on the King by his chief minister, Thomas Cromwell.

==Wedding preparations==

The artist Hans Holbein the Younger was dispatched to Düren to paint portraits of Anne and her younger sister, Amalia, each of whom Henry VIII was considering as his fourth wife. Henry required the artist to be as accurate as possible, not to flatter the sisters. The portraits are now located in the Louvre Museum in Paris and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Another 1539 portrait, by the school of Barthel Bruyn the Elder, is in the collection of Trinity College, Cambridge.

Negotiations to arrange the marriage were in full swing by March 1539. Thomas Cromwell oversaw the talks and a marriage treaty was signed on 4 October of that year.

Henry valued education and cultural sophistication in women (e.g., Anne Boleyn), but Anne lacked these traits. She had received no formal education but was skilled in needlework and liked playing card games. She could read and write, but only in German. Nevertheless, Anne was considered gentle, virtuous and docile, which is why she was recommended as a suitable candidate for Henry.

Anne was described by French ambassador Charles de Marillac as tall and slim, &quot;of medium beauty, and of very assured and resolute countenance.&quot; She was fair-haired and was said to have had a lovely face. In the words of the chronicler Edward Hall, &quot;Her hair hanging down, which was fair, yellow and long ... she was apparelled after the English fashion, with a French hood, which so set forth her beauty and good visage, that every creature rejoiced to behold her.&quot; She appeared rather solemn by English standards, and looked old for her age. Holbein painted her with a high forehead, heavy-lidded eyes and a pointed chin.

Anne was initially to travel to England alone with her cortège – the death of her father prevented her brother and mother from travelling – but there were concerns about a beautiful, sheltered young woman who had never traveled by sea making such a journey, especially during the winter. She traveled from Düsseldorf to Cleves, and then to Antwerp where she was received by fifty English merchants.

Henry met her privately on New Year&#x27;s Day 1540 at Rochester Abbey in Rochester on her journey from Dover. Henry and some of his courtiers, following a courtly-love tradition, went disguised into the room where Anne was staying. The chronicler Charles Wriothesley reported:
[The King] so went up into the chamber where the said Lady Anne was looking out of a window to see the bull-baiting which was going on in the courtyard, and suddenly he embraced and kissed her, and showed her a token which the king had sent her for New Year&#x27;s gift, and she being abashed and not knowing who it was thanked him, and so he spoke with her. But she regarded him little, but always looked out the window ... and when the king saw that she took so little notice of his coming he went into another chamber and took off his cloak and came in again in a coat of purple velvet. And when the lords and knights saw his grace they did him reverence.

According to the testimony of Henry&#x27;s companions, he was disappointed with Anne, feeling that she was not as described. Although Anne &quot;regarded him little&quot;, it is unknown whether she knew this was the King. Henry then revealed his true identity to Anne, and although he is said to have been put off, the marriage preparations proceeded. Henry and Anne then met officially on 3 January on Blackheath outside the gates of Greenwich Park, where a grand reception was laid out.

Most historians believe that Henry&#x27;s misgivings about the marriage were because of Anne&#x27;s unsatisfactory appearance, which did not inspire him to consummate the marriage. He felt that he had been misled after his advisors had praised Anne&#x27;s beauty: &quot;She is nothing so fair as she hath been reported&quot;, he complained. He went even further to tell others in his court that if &quot;it were not that she had come so far into my realm, and the great preparations and state that my people have made for her, and for fear of making a ruffle in the world and of driving her brother into the arms of the Emperor and the French King, I would not now marry her. But now it is too far gone, wherefore I am sorry.&quot;

Cromwell received some blame for the Holbein portrait, which Henry believed had not been an accurate representation of Anne, and for some of the exaggerated reports of her beauty. Henry urged Cromwell to find a legal way to avoid the marriage but, by this point, doing so was impossible without endangering the vital alliance with the Germans. In his anger and frustration, the King turned on Cromwell, to his subsequent regret.

== Marriage ==

Despite Henry&#x27;s very vocal misgivings, the two were married on 6 January 1540 at the royal Palace of Placentia in Greenwich, London, by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer. The phrase &quot;God send me well to keep&quot; was engraved around Anne&#x27;s wedding ring. According to Edward Hall, she wore a &quot;gowne of ryche cloth of gold set full of large flowers of great and Orient pearl, made after the Duche fassion rownde&quot;. A round gown had no train. On the Sunday after the wedding there were jousts, Anne dressed in the English fashion, with a French hood. 

Immediately after arriving in England, Anne conformed to the Catholic form of worship which Henry had retained after his break with Rome. The couple&#x27;s first night as husband and wife was not a successful one. Henry confided to Cromwell that he had not consummated the marriage, saying, &quot;I liked her before not well, but now I like her much worse&quot;.

In February 1540, speaking to the Countess of Rutland, Anne praised the King as a kind husband, saying: &quot;When he comes to bed he kisseth me, and he taketh me by the hand, and biddeth me &#x27;Good night, sweetheart&#x27;; and in the morning kisseth me and biddeth &#x27;Farewell, darling. Lady Rutland responded: &quot;Madam, there must be more than this, or it will be long ere we have a duke of York, which all this realm most desireth.&quot; 

Anne was commanded to leave the Court on 24 June, and on 6 July she was informed of her husband&#x27;s decision to reconsider the marriage. Witness statements were taken from a number of courtiers and two physicians which register the King&#x27;s disappointment at her appearance. Henry had also commented to Thomas Heneage and Anthony Denny that he could not believe she was a virgin.

Shortly afterwards, Anne was asked for her consent to an annulment, to which she agreed. Cromwell, the moving force behind the marriage, was attainted for treason. The marriage was annulled on 12 July 1540, on the grounds of non-consummation and her pre-contract to Francis of Lorraine. Henry VIII&#x27;s physician stated that, after the wedding night, Henry said he was not impotent because he experienced &quot;&quot; (two nocturnal pollutions while in sleep).

==After the annulment==
Anne had been given dower lands in January 1540 to fund her household, including manors in Hampshire formerly owned by Breamore Priory and Southwick Priory. As former queen, she received a generous settlement, including Richmond Palace, and Hever Castle, home of Henry&#x27;s former in-laws, the Boleyns. Anne of Cleves House, in Lewes, East Sussex, is just one of many properties she owned, though she never lived there. Henry and Anne became friendly—she was an honorary member of the King&#x27;s family and was referred to as &quot;the King&#x27;s Beloved Sister&quot;. She was invited to court often and, out of gratitude for her not contesting the annulment, Henry decreed that she would be given precedence over all women in England save his own wife and daughters.

After Catherine Howard was beheaded, Anne and her brother, William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, pressed the King to remarry Anne. Henry quickly refused to do so. She seems to have disliked Catherine Parr, and reportedly reacted to the news of Henry&#x27;s sixth marriage with the remark &quot;Madam Parr is taking a great burden on herself.&quot;

In March 1547, Edward VI&#x27;s Privy Council asked her to move out of Bletchingley Palace, her usual residence, to Penshurst Place to make way for Thomas Cawarden, Master of Revels. They pointed out that Penshurst was nearer to Hever and the move had been Henry VIII&#x27;s will.
On 4 August 1553, Anne wrote to Mary I to congratulate her on her marriage to Philip of Spain. On 28 September 1553, when Mary left St James&#x27;s Palace for Whitehall, she was accompanied by her sister Elizabeth and Anne of Cleves. Anne also took part in Mary I&#x27;s coronation procession, and may have been present at her coronation at Westminster Abbey. These seem to have been her last public appearances, although there is an account of Anne at Westminster Abbey in August 1554 after the wedding of Mary and Philip. As the new queen was a strict Catholic, Anne yet again changed religion, now becoming a Roman Catholic.

After a brief return to prominence, she lost royal favour in 1554, following Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion. According to Simon Renard, the Imperial ambassador, Anne&#x27;s close association with Elizabeth had convinced the Queen that &quot;the Lady [Anne] of Cleves was of the plot and intrigued with the Duke of Cleves to obtain help for Elizabeth: matters in which the king of France was the prime mover&quot;. There is no evidence that Anne was invited back to court after 1554. She was compelled to live a quiet and obscure life on her estates. After her arrival as the King&#x27;s bride, Anne never left England. Despite occasional feelings of homesickness, Anne was generally content in England and was described by Raphael Holinshed as &quot;a ladie of right commendable regards, courteous, gentle, a good housekeeper and verie bountifull to her servants.&quot;

In the summer of 1556, Anne&#x27;s brother, William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, complained about some of her servants. He had heard that Otto Wylick, Jasper Brockhausen, and his wife, Gertrude, made difficulties in Anne&#x27;s household. Gertrude was said to have beguiled Anne with impostures and incantations. The matter came before Queen Mary and the English council of Philip II, and in September Brockhausen and Wylick were expelled.

==Death==
When Anne&#x27;s health began to fail, Mary allowed her to live at Chelsea Old Manor, where Henry&#x27;s last wife, Catherine Parr, had lived after her remarriage. Here, in the middle of July 1557, Anne dictated her last will. In it, she mentions her brother, sister, and sister-in-law, as well as the future Queen Elizabeth, the Duchess of Suffolk, and the Countess of Arundel. She left some money to her servants and asked Mary and Elizabeth to employ them in their households. She was remembered by everyone who served her as a particularly generous and easy-going mistress.

Anne died at Chelsea Old Manor on 16 July 1557. The most likely cause of her death was cancer. She was buried in Westminster Abbey, on 3 August, in what has been described as a &quot;somewhat hard-to-find tomb&quot; on the opposite side of Edward the Confessor&#x27;s shrine and slightly above eye level for a person of average height.

Anne&#x27;s epitaph in Westminster Abbey, which is in English, reads simply:

She was the last of Henry VIII&#x27;s wives to die.

<text>Catherine Parr ( – 5 September 1548) was Queen of England and Ireland as the last of the six wives of King Henry VIII from their marriage on 12 July 1543 until Henry&#x27;s death on 28 January 1547. Catherine was the final queen consort of the House of Tudor, and outlived Henry by a year and eight months. With four husbands, she is the most-married English queen. She was the first woman to publish in print an original work under her own name in England in the English language.

Catherine enjoyed a close relationship with Henry&#x27;s three children, Mary, Elizabeth and Edward. She was personally involved in the education of Elizabeth and Edward. She was influential in Henry&#x27;s passing of the Third Succession Act in 1543 that restored his daughters Mary and Elizabeth to the line of succession to the throne. Catherine was appointed regent from July to September 1544 while Henry was on a military campaign in France; in the event that he lost his life, she was to rule as regent until Edward came of age. However, he did not give her any function in government in his will. Following the King&#x27;s death, she assumed the role of guardian to her stepdaughter Elizabeth, and took Henry&#x27;s great-niece Lady Jane Grey into her household.

On 25 April 1544, Catherine published her first book, &quot;Psalms or Prayers&quot;, anonymously. Her book &quot;Prayers or Meditations&quot; became the first original book published by an English queen under her own name on 2 June 1545. She published a third book, &quot;The Lamentation of a Sinner&quot;, on 5 November 1547, nine months after the death of King Henry VIII. On account of her Protestant sympathies, she provoked the enmity of anti-Protestant officials, who sought to turn the King against her; a warrant for her arrest was drawn up, probably in the spring of 1546. However, she and the king soon reconciled.

After Henry&#x27;s death on 28 January 1547, Catherine was allowed to keep the queen&#x27;s jewels and dresses as queen dowager. About six months after Henry&#x27;s death, she married her fourth and final husband, Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley. Seymour was an uncle of Henry&#x27;s successor, King Edward VI (Catherine&#x27;s stepson) and the younger brother of Lord Protector of England Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, and of Jane Seymour, Henry&#x27;s third wife. Catherine&#x27;s fourth and final marriage was short-lived, for she died on 5 September 1548 due to complications of childbirth. Her funeral was held on 7 September 1548 and was the first Protestant funeral in England, Scotland or Ireland to be held in English.

==Early life and adolescence==
Catherine Parr was the eldest child of Sir Thomas Parr, lord of the manor of Kendal in Westmorland (now in Westmorland and Furness), and Maud Green, daughter and co-heiress of Sir Thomas Green, lord of Greens Norton, Northamptonshire, and Joan Fogge. Like Anne Boleyn, Catherine had been raised as a Catholic but at some point turned to Protestantism. Sir Thomas Parr was a descendant of King Edward III, and the Parrs were a substantial northern family which included many knights. Catherine had a younger brother, William, who after much wrangling was later created first Marquess of Northampton, and a younger sister, Anne, later Countess of Pembroke. Sir Thomas was a close companion to King Henry VIII, and was rewarded as such with responsibilities and/or incomes from his positions as Sheriff of Northamptonshire, Master of the Wards, and Comptroller of the Household, in addition to being the lord of Kendal. Catherine&#x27;s mother was a close friend and attendant of Catherine of Aragon, and Catherine Parr was probably named after Queen Catherine, who was her godmother.

She was born in 1512, probably in either late July or August. It was once thought that Catherine Parr had been born at Kendal Castle in Westmorland. However, at the time of her birth, Kendal Castle was already in very poor condition. During her pregnancy, Maud Parr remained at court, attending the Queen, and by necessity the Parr family were living in their townhouse at Blackfriars. Historians now consider it unlikely that Sir Thomas would have taken his pregnant wife on an arduous two-week journey north over bad roads to give birth in a crumbling castle in which neither of them seemed to spend much time. Catherine&#x27;s father died when she was young, and she was close to her mother as she grew up.

Catherine&#x27;s initial education was similar to other well-born women, but she developed a passion for learning which would continue throughout her life. She was fluent in French, Latin (a language in which she composed), and Italian, and began learning Spanish after becoming queen. According to biographer Linda Porter, the story that as a child, Catherine could not tolerate sewing and often said to her mother that &quot;my hands are ordained to touch crowns and sceptres, not spindles and needles&quot; is very likely apocryphal.

===First marriage (1529–1533)===
In 1529, when she was seventeen, Catherine married Sir Edward Burgh (pronounced and sometimes written as &quot;Borough&quot;), a grandson of Edward Burgh, 2nd Baron Burgh. Earlier biographies had mistakenly reported that Catherine had married the older Burgh. Following the 2nd Baron Burgh&#x27;s death in December 1528, Catherine&#x27;s father-in-law Sir Thomas Burgh was summoned to Parliament in 1529 as Baron Burgh.

Catherine&#x27;s first husband was in his twenties and may have been in poor health. He served as a feoffee for Thomas Kiddell and as a justice of the peace. His father also secured a joint patent in survivorship with his son for the office of steward of the manor of the soke of Kirton in Lindsey. The younger Sir Edward Burgh died in the spring of 1533, not surviving to inherit the title of Baron Burgh.

==Lady Latimer (1534–1543)==
Following her first husband&#x27;s death, Catherine Parr may have spent time with the Dowager Lady Strickland, Katherine Neville, who was the widow of Catherine&#x27;s cousin Sir Walter Strickland, at the Stricklands&#x27; family residence of Sizergh Castle in Westmorland (now in Cumbria). In the summer of 1534, Catherine married, secondly, John Neville, 3rd Baron Latimer, her father&#x27;s second cousin and a kinsman of Lady Strickland. With this marriage, Catherine became only the second woman in the Parr family to marry into the peerage.

The twice-widowed Latimer was nearly twice Catherine&#x27;s age. From his first marriage to Dorothy de Vere, sister of John de Vere, 14th Earl of Oxford, he had two children, John and Margaret. Although Latimer was in financial difficulties after he and his brothers had pursued legal action to claim the title of Earl of Warwick, Catherine now had a home of her own, a title and a husband with a position and influence in the north.

===Pilgrimage of Grace and later===
Latimer was a supporter of the Catholic Church and had opposed the King&#x27;s first annulment, his subsequent marriage to Anne Boleyn, and the religious consequences. In October 1536, during the Lincolnshire Rising, Catholic rebels appeared before the Latimers&#x27; home, threatening violence if Latimer did not join their efforts to reinstate the links between England and Rome. Catherine watched as her husband was dragged away. Between October 1536 and April 1537, Catherine lived alone in fear with her step-children, struggling to survive. It is probable that, in these uncertain times, Catherine&#x27;s strong reaction against the rebellion strengthened her adherence to the reformed Church of England. In January 1537, during the uprising known as the Pilgrimage of Grace, Catherine and her step-children were held hostage at Snape Castle in North Yorkshire. The rebels ransacked the house and sent word to Lord Latimer, who was returning from London, that if he did not return immediately they would kill his family. When Latimer returned to the castle, he managed to talk the rebels into releasing his family and leaving, but the aftermath was taxing on the whole family.

The King and Thomas Cromwell heard conflicting reports as to whether Latimer was a prisoner or a conspirator. As a conspirator, he could be found guilty of treason, forfeiting his estates and leaving Catherine and her step-children penniless. The King himself wrote to Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, pressing him to make sure Latimer would &quot;condemn that villain [Robert] Aske and submit to our clemency&quot;. Latimer complied. It is likely that Catherine&#x27;s brother William Parr and her uncle, William Parr, 1st Baron Parr of Horton, who both fought against the rebellion, intervened to save Latimer&#x27;s life.

Although no charges were laid against him, Latimer&#x27;s reputation, which reflected upon Catherine, was tarnished for the rest of his life. Over the next seven years, the family spent much of their time in the south. In 1542, the family spent time in London as Latimer attended parliament. Catherine visited her brother William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton and her sister Anne Parr, Countess of Pembroke at court. It was here that Catherine became acquainted with her future fourth husband, Sir Thomas Seymour. The atmosphere of the court was greatly different from that of the rural estates she knew. There, Catherine could find the latest trends, not only in religious matters, but in less weighty secular matters such as fashion and jewellery.

By the winter of 1542, Lord Latimer&#x27;s health had worsened. Catherine nursed her husband until his death in 1543. In his will, Catherine was named as guardian of his daughter, Margaret, and was put in charge of his affairs until his daughter&#x27;s majority. Latimer left Catherine a life interest in the manor of Stowe in Northamptonshire, eleven miles from Horton, and other properties. He also bequeathed money for supporting his daughter, and in the case that his daughter did not marry within five years, Catherine was to take £30 a year out of the income to support her. Catherine was left a rich widow, but after Lord Latimer&#x27;s death she faced the possibility of having to return north. It is likely that Catherine sincerely mourned her husband; she kept a remembrance of him, his New Testament with his name inscribed inside, until her death.

Using her late mother&#x27;s friendship with Henry&#x27;s first queen, Catherine of Aragon, Catherine took the opportunity to renew her own friendship with the former queen&#x27;s daughter, Lady Mary. By 16 February 1543, Catherine had established herself as part of Mary&#x27;s household, and it was there that Catherine caught the attention of the King. Although she had begun a romantic friendship with Sir Thomas Seymour, the brother of the late queen Jane Seymour, she saw it as her duty to accept Henry&#x27;s proposal over Seymour&#x27;s. Seymour was given a posting in Brussels to remove him from the King&#x27;s court.

==Queen of England and Ireland==

Catherine married Henry VIII on 12 July 1543 at Hampton Court Palace. She was the first queen of England also to be queen of Ireland following Henry&#x27;s adoption of the title king of Ireland. She was also the third of his wives to be named Catherine, although she spelled it &quot;Kateryn&quot; in signatures. Catherine and her new husband shared several common royal and noble ancestors, making them multiple cousins. By Henry&#x27;s mother and Catherine&#x27;s father they were third cousins once removed, sharing Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, and Lady Joan Beaufort (granddaughter of Edward III), and by their fathers they were double fourth cousins once removed, sharing Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent (son of Joan of Kent) and Lady Alice FitzAlan (granddaughter of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster) and John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster (son of Edward III) and Katherine Swynford.

On becoming queen, Catherine installed her former stepdaughter, Margaret Neville, as her lady-in-waiting, and gave her cousin Maud, Lady Lane and her stepson John&#x27;s wife, Lucy Somerset, positions in her household. Catherine was partially responsible for reconciling Henry with his daughters from his first two marriages, and also developed a good relationship with Henry&#x27;s son Edward. When she became queen, her uncle Lord Parr of Horton became her Lord Chamberlain.

Parr&#x27;s &quot;Psalms or Prayers taken out of Holy Scriptures&quot;, was printed by the King&#x27;s printer on 25 April 1544. It was an anonymous translation of a Latin work by Bishop John Fisher () that had been reprinted on 18 April 1544. Fisher had been executed in 1535 for refusing to take the oath of supremacy, and his name does not appear on the title page. Parr&#x27;s volume appeared as preparations for war were being finalised, and it served as a powerful piece of wartime propaganda designed to help Henry win the war against France and Scotland via the prayers of his people. The volume contains seventeen &quot;Psalms&quot;, focused largely on defeating enemies, and it concludes with &quot;A Prayer for the King&quot;, derived from a prayer for the Holy Roman Emperor by Georg Witzel, and &quot;A Prayer for Men to Say Entering into Battle&quot;, a translation of a prayer by Erasmus. Parr paid for deluxe gift copies of the book which were printed on vellum and distributed at court. One deluxe copy has annotations by Henry VIII. The &quot;Ninth Psalm&quot; was set to pre-existing music by Thomas Tallis and was likely performed as part of special wartime ceremony at St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 22 May 1544. Parr&#x27;s &quot;A Prayer for the King&quot; had an important afterlife. In 1559, it was edited and inserted into the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, probably by Elizabeth I who was then Supreme Governor of the Church of England. This prayer remains in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; and is still used to pray for the British monarch by Anglican communities around the globe.

Henry went on his last campaign to France from July to September 1544, leaving Catherine as his regent. Because her regency council was composed of sympathetic members, including: Thomas Cranmer (the Archbishop of Canterbury), Lord Hertford and her uncle William Parr, Lord Parr of Horton (included at her particular request), Catherine obtained effective control and was able to rule as she saw fit. She handled provision, finances, and musters for Henry&#x27;s French campaign, signed five royal proclamations, and maintained constant contact with her lieutenant in the northern Marches, Lord Shrewsbury, over the complex and unstable situation with Scotland. It is thought that her actions as regent, together with her strength of character and noted dignity, and later religious convictions, greatly influenced her stepdaughter Lady Elizabeth (the future Elizabeth I).

Parr&#x27;s second publication, &quot;Prayers or Meditations&quot;, appeared in June 1545, and, like her first book, it was a bestseller. In this case, Parr&#x27;s compositional method was a complex one as she reworked the third book of Thomas à Kempis&#x27;s &quot;Imitatio Christi&quot; to produce a monologue spoken by a generic Christian speaker. The volume also circulated in manuscript and deluxe print copies. Princess Elizabeth translated the work into Latin, Italian and French as a New Year&#x27;s gift for Henry VIII in December 1545 and presented the manuscript in a beautiful hand-embroidered cover. The volume has been digitised by the British Library.

The Queen&#x27;s religious views were viewed with suspicion by anti-Protestant officials such as Stephen Gardiner (the Bishop of Winchester) and Lord Wriothesley (the Lord Chancellor). Although brought up as a Catholic, she later became sympathetic to and interested in the &quot;New Faith&quot;. By the mid-1540s, she came under suspicion that she was actually a Protestant. This view is supported by the strong reformed ideas that she revealed after Henry&#x27;s death, when her third book, &quot;Lamentation of a Sinner,&quot; was published in late 1547. In 1546, the Bishop of Winchester and Lord Wriothesley tried to turn the King against her. An arrest warrant was drawn up for her and rumours abounded across Europe that the King was attracted to her close friend, the Duchess of Suffolk. However, she saw the warrant and managed to reconcile with the King after vowing that she had only argued about religion with him to take his mind off the suffering caused by his ulcerous leg. The following day chancellor Wriothesley (with a detachment of the Guard), who was unaware of the reconciliation, tried to arrest her while she walked with Henry. The King angrily dismissed his chancellor.

==Final marriage and death==
Shortly before he died, Henry made provision for an allowance of £7,000 per year for Catherine to support herself. He further ordered that, after his death, Catherine, though a queen dowager, should be given the respect of a queen of England, as if he were still alive. After the coronation of her stepson, Edward VI, on 31 January 1547, Catherine retired from court to her home at Old Manor in Chelsea.

Following Henry&#x27;s death, Catherine&#x27;s old love and the new king&#x27;s uncle, Thomas Seymour (who was soon created 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley), returned to court. Catherine was quick to accept when Seymour renewed his suit of marriage. Since only four months had passed since the death of King Henry, Seymour knew that the Regency council would not agree to a petition for the Queen Dowager to marry so soon. Sometime near the end of May, Catherine and Seymour married in secret. King Edward VI and the council were not informed of the union for several months. When their union became public knowledge, it caused a minor scandal. The King and Lady Mary were very much displeased by the union. After being censured and reprimanded by the council, Seymour wrote to the Lady Mary asking her to intervene on his behalf. Mary became furious at his forwardness and tasteless actions and refused to help. Mary even went as far as asking her half-sister, Lady Elizabeth, not to interact with Queen Catherine any further.

During this time, Catherine began having altercations with her brother-in-law, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset. Like Thomas, Edward was the King&#x27;s uncle, and was also the Lord Protector. A rivalry developed between Catherine and his wife, her own former lady-in-waiting, Anne Seymour, Duchess of Somerset, which became particularly acute over the matter of Catherine&#x27;s jewels. The Duchess argued that Catherine, as queen dowager, was no longer entitled to wear the jewels belonging to the wife of the king. Instead she, as the wife of the protector, should be the one to wear them. The whole ordeal left her relationship with Catherine permanently damaged; the relationship between the two Seymour brothers also worsened as a result, since Thomas saw the whole dispute as a personal attack by his brother on his social standing.

In November 1547, Catherine published her third book, &quot;The Lamentation of a Sinner&quot;. The book promoted the Protestant concept of justification by faith alone, which the Catholic Church deemed to be heresy. It was sponsored by Katherine Brandon, Duchess of Suffolk, and by William Parr (Catherine&#x27;s brother), and William Cecil, Elizabeth I&#x27;s future chief minister, wrote the preface. In 1544 or 1545, Parr had started to organise an English translation of Erasmus&#x27;s &quot;Paraphrases Upon the New Testament&quot;, and the massive volume was finally printed in January 1548. Parr had enlisted Nicholas Udall, Thomas Keyes and Mary Tudor to translate different sections and she may have produced the paraphrase of Matthew. In July 1547 the Edwardian state ordered every parish to obtain a copy and many generations of literate parishioners would have encountered lengthy dedications praising Parr&#x27;s learning, her commitment to the vernacular Bible, and her role in the English reformation. Parr owned many books and she participated in the cultural practice of writing in her books and signing books that belonged to others. 

At the age of 35, Catherine became pregnant. This pregnancy was a surprise, as Catherine had not conceived during her first three marriages. During this time, Seymour began to take an interest in Lady Elizabeth. Seymour had reputedly plotted to marry her before marrying Catherine, and it was reported later that Catherine discovered the two in an embrace. On a few occasions before the situation risked getting completely out of hand, according to the deposition of Kat Ashley, Catherine appears not only to have acquiesced in episodes of horseplay, but actually to have assisted her husband. Whatever actually happened, Elizabeth was sent away in May 1548 to stay with Sir Anthony Denny&#x27;s household at Cheshunt and never saw her beloved stepmother again, although the two corresponded. Elizabeth immediately wrote a letter to the Queen and Seymour after she left Chelsea. The letter demonstrates a sort of remorse.

Kat Ashley, whose deposition was given after Catherine had died and Seymour had been arrested for another attempt at marrying Lady Elizabeth, had developed a crush on Seymour during her time at Chelsea and encouraged her charge to &quot;play along&quot;. At one point she even made a comment at how lucky Elizabeth would have been to have a husband like Seymour. Ashley even told Lady Elizabeth that Seymour had confided his sentiments to her of wanting to marry Elizabeth before Catherine. After Catherine&#x27;s death, Ashley strongly encouraged Elizabeth to write to Seymour offering her condolences; to &quot;comfort him of his sorrow...for he would think great kindness therein.&quot;

In June 1548, Catherine, accompanied by Lady Jane Grey, moved to Sudeley Castle in Gloucestershire. The dowager queen promised to provide education for her. It was there that Catherine would spend the last few months of her pregnancy and the last summer of her life.

Catherine gave birth to her only child, a daughter, Mary Seymour, named after Catherine&#x27;s stepdaughter Mary, on 30 August 1548. Catherine died on 5 September 1548, at Sudeley Castle, from what is thought to have been &quot;childbed fever&quot;. This illness was common due to the lack of hygiene around childbirth.

Catherine&#x27;s funeral was held on 7 September 1548. It was the first Protestant funeral held in English. Her chief mourner was Lady Jane Grey. She was buried in St. Mary&#x27;s Chapel on the grounds of Sudeley Castle, Gloucestershire, England.

Thomas Seymour was beheaded for treason on 20 March 1549 and Mary Seymour was taken to live with the Dowager Duchess of Suffolk, a close friend of Catherine&#x27;s. Catherine&#x27;s other jewels were kept in a coffer with five drawers at Sudeley and this was sent to the Tower of London on 20 April 1549, and her clothes and papers followed in May. After a year and a half, on 17 March 1550, Mary&#x27;s property was restored to her by the Restitution of Mary Seymour Act 1549 (3 &amp; 4 Edw. 6. c. 14), easing the burden of the infant&#x27;s household on the Duchess. The last mention of Mary Seymour on record is on her second birthday, and although stories circulated that she eventually married and had children, most historians believe she died as a child at Grimsthorpe Castle in Lincolnshire.

==Remains==

During the English Civil War, Sudeley Castle was used as a base by King Charles I, leading to its siege and sack by Parliamentarians in January 1643, during which Catherine&#x27;s grave was probably disturbed and her monument destroyed. Contemporary writer Bruno Ryves reported that:

&quot;There is in the castle a goodly fair church, here they dug up the graves, and disturb the ashes of the dead, they break down the monuments of the Chandoses&quot;.

The castle changed hands several times during the war, suffering a second siege, before being slighted in 1649, leading to it being largely abandoned, and the royal grave lost.

Catherine&#x27;s presence at the castle was first rediscovered by the antiquarian Rev. Huggett when researching at the College of Arms, passing his findings onto George Pitt, 1st Baron Rivers, the owner of the castle in 1768.

Joseph Lucas, a member of the local gentry who dwelled in the outer court of the castle, renting it from Baron Rivers, was aware of Huggett&#x27;s work and searched for the lost grave, discovering it among the ruins of the chapel in 1782. An account of the discovery was later published in &quot;Notes and Queries&quot; by the daughter of a Mr. Brooks, who had been present at the discovery.

&quot;In the summer of the year 1782 the earth in which Qu. K. Par lay inter&#x27;d was removed, and at the depth of about two feet (or very little more) her leaden coffin or coffin was found quite whole... Mr. Jno Lucas had the curiosity to rip up the top of the coffin, expecting to discover within it only the bones of the deceased, but to his great surprise found the whole body wrapped in 6 or 7 seer cloth linen, entire and uncorrupted... his unwarranted curiosity led him to make an incision through the seer cloth which covered one of the arms of the corpse, the flesh of which at the time was white and moist&quot;.

The coffin was reopened in 1783, 1784, 1786; and in 1792, when local vandals broke into the coffin and threw the corpse in a rubbish heap, leading to Mr. Lucas reinterring the body in a hidden, walled grave.

The last time the coffin was opened was in 1817 when the local rector decided to move it to the crypt under the chapel. When opening it this final time it was found the body had been reduced to a skeleton, and much of the coffin filled with ivy.

During these various openings of the coffin, fragments of Catherine&#x27;s dress and locks of her hair were collected, one of which was gifted to Elizabeth Hamilton. The majority of these items are now on display at Sudeley Castle.

The coffin was last moved in 1861 to its final location in the fully restored chapel, under a canopied neo-Gothic tomb designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott, with a recumbent marble figure by John Birnie Philip.

==Iconography==

The full-length portrait of Catherine Parr by Master John in the National Portrait Gallery was for many years thought to represent Lady Jane Grey. The painting has recently been re-identified as Catherine Parr, with whose name it was originally associated. The full-length format was very rare in portraits of this date, and was usually used only for very important sitters. Lady Jane Grey, although of royal blood, was a relatively obscure child of eight when this was painted ( 1545); it was to be another eight years before the short-lived attempt at placing her on the throne. The distinctive crown-shaped jewel the sitter wears can be traced to an inventory of jewels that belonged to Catherine Parr, and the cameo beads appear to have belonged to Catherine Howard, from whom they would have passed to her successor as queen.

Another contemporary painting of Catherine Parr by Master John was likely painted in c.1547–1548, and in the past mistakenly labelled as Mary I or Lady Jane Grey. The painting, from the collection of the earls of Jersey, was thought to be lost in a fire by 1969, but was auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s in July 2023.

==Historiography==
The popular myth that Catherine Parr acted more as her husband&#x27;s nurse than his wife was born in the 19th century from the work of Victorian moralist and proto-feminist Agnes Strickland. David Starkey challenged this assumption in his book &quot;Six Wives&quot;, in which he points out that such a situation would have been vaguely obscene to the Tudors—given that Henry had a huge staff of physicians waiting on him hand and foot, and Catherine was expected to live up to the heavy expectations of queenly dignity.

Catherine&#x27;s good sense, moral rectitude, compassion, firm religious commitment, and strong sense of loyalty and devotion have earned her many admirers among historians. These include Starkey, feminist activist Karen Lindsey, Lady Antonia Fraser, Alison Weir, Carolly Erickson, Alison Plowden, Susan James and Linda Porter. Biographers have described her as strong-willed and outspoken, physically desirable, susceptible (like Queen Elizabeth) to roguish charm, and even willing to resort to obscene language if the occasion suited.

<text>General Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio, Prince of Montenevoso (, ; ; 12 March 1863 – 1 March 1938), sometimes written d&#x27;Annunzio as he used to sign himself, was an Italian poet, playwright, orator, journalist, aristocrat, and Royal Italian Army officer during World War I. He occupied a prominent place in Italian literature from 1889 to 1910 and in its political life from 1914 to 1924. He was often referred to by the epithets (&quot;the Poet&quot;; the Italian directly stems from Latin , and its meaning is a poet with special emphasis on prophetic, inspiring, or divining qualities) and (&quot;the Prophet&quot;).

D&#x27;Annunzio was associated with the Decadent movement in his literary works, which interplayed closely with French symbolism and British aestheticism. Such works represented a turn against the naturalism of the preceding romantics and was both sensuous and mystical. He came under the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche, which would find outlets in his literary and later political contributions. His affairs with several women, including Eleonora Duse and Luisa Casati, received public attention. In his politics, which evolved many times, he associated himself with socialism and the progressivist views of the political left, responding to the illiberal and reactionary policies of Luigi Pelloux, as well as with the Historical Far Left.

During the Great War, D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s image in Italy transformed from literary figure to national war hero. He was associated with the elite &quot;Arditi&quot; storm troops of the Italian Army and took part in actions such as the Flight over Vienna. As part of an Italian nationalist reaction against the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, he set up the short-lived Italian Regency of Carnaro in Fiume with himself as &quot;Duce&quot;. The Charter of Carnaro made music the fundamental principle of the state, which was corporatist in nature. Although D&#x27;Annunzio later preached nationalism and never called himself a fascist, he has been credited with partially inventing Italian fascism, as both his ideas and his aesthetics were an influence upon Benito Mussolini. At the same time, he was an influence on Italian socialists and an early inspiration to the first phase of the Italian resistance movement to fascism.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and family ===

D&#x27;Annunzio was born in the township of Pescara, in the modern-day Italian region of Abruzzo, the son of a wealthy landowner and mayor of the town, Francesco Paolo Rapagnetta D&#x27;Annunzio (1838–1893) and his wife Luisa de Benedictis (1839–1917). His father was born Francesco Paolo Rapagnetta, the sixth child of Camillo Rapagnetta, a shoemaker, and Rita Olimpia Lolli. At the age of 13, he was adopted by a sister of his mother Rita, Anna Lolli, who had remarried, after the death of her first husband, a wealthy merchant and shipowner, Antonio D&#x27;Annunzio. D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Camillo Rapagnetta (1795–1866) registered his birth. Legend has it that D&#x27;Annunzio was initially baptised Gaetano and given the name of Gabriele later in childhood because of his angelic looks; this story is purely fictitious, as can be seen by D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s birth certificate and baptismal records, which record &quot;Gabriele&quot; as both his birth and baptismal name.

D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s precocious talent was recognised early in life, and he was sent to school at the Liceo Cicognini in Prato, Tuscany. He published his first poems – a small volume of verses called &quot;Primo Vere&quot; – in 1879, at the age of sixteen and while still at school. Influenced by Giosuè Carducci&#x27;s &quot;Odi barbare&quot;, he placed some almost brutal imitations of Lorenzo Stecchetti, the fashionable poet of &quot;Postuma&quot;, side by side with translations from the Latin. His verse was so distinguished that the literary critic Giuseppe Chiarini, upon reading it, brought the unknown youth before the public in an enthusiastic article.

In 1881, D&#x27;Annunzio entered the University of Rome La Sapienza, where he became a member of various literary groups, including , and wrote articles and criticism for local newspapers. In those university years, he started to promote Italian irredentism.

=== Literary work ===
D&#x27;Annunzio published (1882), (1882), (1883), (1884) and the greater part of the short stories that were afterwards collected under the general title of (1886). contains poems full of pulsating youth and the promise of power, some descriptive of the sea and some of the Abruzzese landscape, commented on and completed in prose by , the latter a collection of short stories dealing in radiant language with the peasant life of the author&#x27;s native province. is the beginning of D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s second and characteristic manner. His conception of style was new, and he chose to express all the most subtle vibrations of voluptuous life. Both style and contents began to startle his critics; some who had greeted him as an &quot;enfant prodige&quot; rejected him as a perverter of public morals, whilst others hailed him as one bringing a breath of fresh air and an impulse of new vitality into the somewhat prim, lifeless work hitherto produced.

Meanwhile, the review of D&#x27;Annunzio publisher Angelo Sommaruga perished in the midst of scandal, and his group of young authors found itself dispersed. Some entered the teaching career and were lost to literature, others threw themselves into journalism. D&#x27;Annunzio took this latter course, and joined the staff of the , under the pseudonym of &quot;Duca Minimo&quot;. Here he wrote (1886), a love poem, in which for the first time he drew inspiration adapted to modern sentiments and passions from the rich colours of the Renaissance. is also interesting because in it one can find most of the germs of his future work, just as in and in certain ballads and sonnets one can find descriptions and emotions which later went to form the aesthetic contents of , and (1892).

D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s first novel (1889, translated into English as &quot;The Child of Pleasure&quot;) was followed in 1891 by &quot;Giovanni Episcopo&quot;, and in 1892 by &quot;L&#x27;innocente&quot; (&quot;The Intruder&quot;). These three novels made a profound impression. &quot;L&#x27;innocente&quot;, admirably translated into French by Georges Herelle, brought its author the notice and applause of foreign critics. His next work, &quot;Il trionfo della morte&quot; (&quot;The Triumph of Death&quot;) (1894), was followed soon by (&quot;The Maidens of the Rocks&quot;) (1896) and (&quot;The Flame of Life&quot;) (1900); the latter is in its descriptions of Venice perhaps the most ardent glorification of a city existing in any language.
D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s poetic work of this period, in most respects his finest, is represented by (1893), the (1893), a superb attempt at civic poetry, and (1900). A later phase of D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s work is his dramatic production, represented by (1897), a lyrical fantasia in one act, and his (&quot;The Dead City&quot;) (1898), written for Sarah Bernhardt. In 1898 he wrote his and &quot;La Gioconda&quot;; in the succeeding year &quot;La gloria&quot;, an attempt at contemporary political tragedy which met with no success, probably because of the audacity of the personal and political allusions in some of its scenes; and then &quot;Francesca da Rimini&quot; (1901), based on an episode from Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;; a perfect reconstruction of medieval atmosphere and emotion, magnificent in style, and declared by an authoritative Italian critic – Edoardo Boutet – to be the first real, if imperfect, tragedy ever given to the Italian theatre. It was adapted by Tito Ricordi to become the libretto for the opera Francesca da Rimini by Riccardo Zandonai, which premiered in 1914.

In 1883, D&#x27;Annunzio married Maria Hardouin di Gallese, and had three sons, Mario (1884–1964), Gabriele Maria &quot;Gabriellino&quot; (1886–1945) and Ugo Veniero (1887–1945), but the marriage ended in 1891. In 1894, he began a love affair with the actress Eleonora Duse which became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot;. He provided leading roles for her in his plays of the time such as &quot;La città morta&quot; (1898) and &quot;Francesca da Rimini&quot; (1901), but the tempestuous relationship finally ended in 1910. After meeting the Marchesa Luisa Casati in 1903, he began a lifelong turbulent on again-off again affair with Luisa, that lasted until a few years before his death.
In 1897, D&#x27;Annunzio was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for a three-year term, where he sat as an independent. By 1910, his daredevil lifestyle had forced him into debt, and he fled to France to escape his creditors. There he collaborated with composer Claude Debussy on a musical play, &quot;Le Martyre de saint Sébastien&quot; (&quot;The Martyrdom of St Sebastian&quot;), 1911, written for Ida Rubinstein. The Holy See reacted by placing all of his works in the Index of Forbidden Books. The work was not successful as a play, but it has been recorded in adapted versions several times, notably by Pierre Monteux (in French), Leonard Bernstein (songs in French, dialogue in English), and Michael Tilson Thomas (in French). In 1912 and 1913, D&#x27;Annunzio worked with opera composer Pietro Mascagni, writing the libretto for the opera &quot;Parisina&quot;, staying sometimes in a house rented by the composer in Bellevue, near Paris. D&#x27;Annunzio insisted that the entire, long libretto should be set to music, which eventually meant that the work was too long for audiences of the time, and required the entire last act to be removed.

In 1901, D&#x27;Annunzio and Ettore Ferrari, the Grand Master of the Grand Orient of Italy, founded the Università Popolare di Milano (Popular University of Milan), located in via Ugo Foscolo. D&#x27;Annunzio held the inaugural speech and subsequently became an associated professor and a lecturer in the same institution. In 1902, D&#x27;Annunzio visited Istria, an &quot;irredent land&quot;, then under Austro-Hungarian rule. He was welcomed in Pisino by a &quot;pouring of flowers&quot; let down from the windows of the crowded houses, visited the Italian gymnasium and was paid a homage designed by the future wife of Francesco Salata. In a letter addressed to the same Italian historian, D&#x27;Annunzio complimented with him about the civility of the Italian population living there, praising the struggle of the &quot;great, manifold, transfiguring Latin civilization against the barbaric abuse&quot;.

D&#x27;Annunzio was a Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Italy, a Scottish Rite that in 1908 had separated from the Grand Orient of Italy. Subsequently, he adhered to the mystic and philosophic movimento known as Martinism, collaborating in Fiume with other 33rd degree Scottish Rite Freemasons and occultists like Alceste De Ambris, Sante Ceccherini, and Marco Egidio Allegri. The Masonic initiation of D&#x27;Annunzio his testified by the choice of Masonic symbols for the flag of the Regence of Carnaro like the Ouroboros and the seven stars of the Ursa Major.

=== World War I ===
After the start of World War I, D&#x27;Annunzio returned to Italy and made public speeches in favor of Italy&#x27;s entry on the side of the Triple Entente. Since taking a flight with Wilbur Wright in 1908, D&#x27;Annunzio had been interested in aviation. With the war beginning he volunteered and achieved further celebrity as a fighter pilot, losing the sight of an eye in a flying accident.
In February 1918, he took part in a daring, if militarily irrelevant, raid on the harbour of Bakar (known in Italy as , lit. &quot;the Bakar Mockery&quot;), helping to raise the spirits of the Italian public, still battered by the Caporetto disaster. On 9 August 1918, as commander of the 87th fighter squadron &quot;La Serenissima&quot;, he organized one of the great feats of the war, leading nine planes in a 700-mile round trip to drop propaganda leaflets on Vienna. This is called in Italian &quot;il Volo su Vienna&quot;, &quot;the Flight over Vienna&quot;.

=== Fiume ===

The war strengthened D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s ultranationalist and Italian irredentist views, and he campaigned widely for Italy to assume a role alongside her wartime allies as a first-rate European power. Angered by the proposed handing over of the city of Fiume (now Rijeka in Croatia) whose population, when the suburbs are included, was mostly Italian, at the Paris Peace Conference, on 12 September 1919, D&#x27;Annunzio led 186 grenadiers of the Royal Italian Army&#x27;s 2nd Grenadiers Regiment&#x27;s I Battalion from Ronchi to Fiume to seize the city. Within days troops from other army units joined D&#x27;Annunzio in Fiume, who soon commanded a force of 2,500 troops of former Royal Italian Army troops, Italian nationalists, and World War I veterans of the Italian front. D&#x27;Annunzio then forced the inter-Allied (American, British and French) occupying forces to withdraw. The plotters sought to have Italy annex Fiume but were denied. Instead, Italy initiated a blockade of Fiume while demanding that the plotters surrender.
D&#x27;Annunzio then declared Fiume an independent state, the Italian Regency of Carnaro; the Charter of Carnaro foreshadowed much of the later Italian Fascist system, with himself as &quot;Duce&quot; (leader). Some elements of the Royal Italian Navy, such as the destroyer &quot;Espero&quot; joined up with D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s local forces. He attempted to organize an alternative to the League of Nations for (selected) oppressed nations of the world (such as the Irish, whom D&#x27;Annunzio attempted to arm in 1920), and sought to make alliances with various separatist groups throughout the Balkans (especially groups of Italians, though also some Slavic and Albanian groups), although without much success. D&#x27;Annunzio ignored the Treaty of Rapallo and declared war on Italy itself, only finally surrendering the city on 29 December 1920 after a bombardment by the Italian navy and five days of fighting.

=== Later life ===

After the Fiume episode, D&#x27;Annunzio retired to his home on Lake Garda and spent his latter years writing and campaigning. Although D&#x27;Annunzio had a strong influence on the ideology of Benito Mussolini, he never became directly involved in fascist government politics in Italy. In 1922, shortly before the march on Rome, he was pushed out of a window by an unknown assailant, or perhaps simply slipped and fell out himself while intoxicated. He survived but was badly injured, and recovered only after Mussolini had been appointed Prime Minister.

In 1924, D&#x27;Annunzio was ennobled by King Victor Emmanuel III and given the hereditary title of Prince of Montenevoso (). In 1937 he was made president of the Royal Academy of Italy. D&#x27;Annunzio died in 1938 of a stroke, at his home in Gardone Riviera. He was given a state funeral by Mussolini and was interred in a magnificent tomb constructed of white marble at Il Vittoriale degli Italiani. His son, Gabriellino D&#x27;Annunzio, became a film director. His 1921 film &quot;The Ship&quot; was based on a novel by his father. In 1924, he co-directed the historical epic , an expensive failure, before retiring from filmmaking.

== Politics ==
=== D&#x27;Annunzio and fascism ===
Although D&#x27;Annunzio initially briefly associated himself with the Historical Right and his political views often evolved, D&#x27;Annunzio later associated himself with the Historical Far Left, socialism, and progressivism. D&#x27;Annunzio is also often seen within the context of proto-fascism as a precursor of the ideals and techniques of Italian fascism. His political ideals emerged in Fiume when he coauthored a constitution with Alceste de Ambris, a syndicalist, the Charter of Carnaro. De Ambris provided the legal and political framework, to which D&#x27;Annunzio added his skills as a poet. De Ambris was the leader of a group of Italian seamen who had mutinied and then given their vessel to the service of D&#x27;Annunzio. The constitution established a corporatist state, with nine corporations to represent the different sectors of the economy (workers, employers, and professionals), and a tenth (D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s invention) to represent the perceived superior human beings, the heroes, poets, prophets, and supermen. The Charter of Carnaro also declared that music was the fundamental principle of the state. Others disagree and cite his initial opposition to fascism, as well as his influence on Italian socialists and anti-fascists.

D&#x27;Annunzio, the &quot;de facto&quot; dictator of Fiume, maintained control through what has been described as a &quot;new and dangerously potent politics of spectacle&quot;. It was this culture of dictatorship that Benito Mussolini imitated and learned from D&#x27;Annunzio. D&#x27;Annunzio has been described as the John the Baptist of Italian fascism, as virtually the entire ritual of Fascism was invented by D&#x27;Annunzio during his occupation of Fiume and his leadership of the Italian Regency of Carnaro. These included the balcony address, the Roman salute, the cries of &quot;Eia, eia, eia! Alala!&quot; taken from Achilles&#x27;s cry in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the dramatic and rhetorical dialogue with the crowd, the use of religious symbols in new secular settings, as well as blackshirted followers (the Arditi) with their disciplined, bestial responses and strongarm repression of dissent. He was even said to have originated the practice of forcibly dosing opponents with large amounts of castor oil, a very effective laxative, to humiliate, disable, or kill them, a practice that became a common tool of Mussolini&#x27;s Blackshirts.

=== Rivalry with Benito Mussolini ===

In his essay &quot;Mussolini and The Cult of the Leader&quot;, John Whittam wrote:

This famous poet, novelist and war hero was a self-proclaimed Superman. He was the outstanding interventionist in May 1915 and his dramatic exploits during the war won him national and international acclaim. In September 1919 he gathered together his &#x27;legions&#x27; and captured the disputed seaport of Fiume. He held it for over a year and it was he who popularised the black shirts, the balcony speeches, the promulgation of ambitious charters and the entire choreography of street parades and ceremonies. He even planned a march on Rome. One historian had rightly described him as the &#x27;First Duce&#x27; and Mussolini must have heaved a sigh of relief when he was driven from Fiume in December 1920 and his followers were dispersed. But he remained a threat to Mussolini and in 1921 Fascists like Balbo seriously considered turning to him for leadership.

In contrast, Mussolini vacillated from left to right at this time. Although Mussolini&#x27;s fascism was heavily influenced by the Charter of Carnaro, the constitution for Fiume written by Alceste De Ambris and D&#x27;Annunzio, neither wanted to play an active part in the new movement, both refusing when asked by Fascist supporters to run in the elections of 15 May 1921. Before the March on Rome, De Ambris even went so far as to depict the Italian fascist movement as &quot;a filthy pawn in Mister Giolitti&#x27;s game of chess, and made out of the least dignified section of the bourgeoisie&quot;.

D&#x27;Annunzio was seriously injured when he fell out of a window on 13 August 1922; subsequently the planned &quot;meeting for national pacification&quot; with Francesco Saverio Nitti and Mussolini was cancelled. The incident was never explained and is considered by some historians an attempt to murder him, motivated by his popularity. Despite D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s retreat from active public life after this event, Mussolini still found it necessary to regularly dole out funds to D&#x27;Annunzio as a bribe for not re-entering the political arena. When asked about this by a close friend, Mussolini purportedly stated: &quot;When you have a rotten tooth you have two possibilities open to you: either you pull the tooth or you fill it with gold. With D&#x27;Annunzio I have chosen for the latter treatment.&quot;

D&#x27;Annunzio kept attempting to intervene in politics almost until his death in 1938. He wrote to Mussolini in 1933 to try to convince him not to ally with Adolf Hitler. In 1934, he tried to disrupt the relationship between Hitler and Mussolini after their first meeting, even writing a satirical pamphlet about Hitler. In September 1937, D&#x27;Annunzio met with Mussolini at the Verona train station to try to convince him to leave the Axis powers.

== Literature ==

At the height of his success, D&#x27;Annunzio was celebrated for the originality, power and decadence of his writing. Although his work had immense impact across Europe, and influenced generations of Italian writers, his &quot;fin de siècle&quot; works are now little known, and his literary reputation has always been clouded by nationalistic ideals, and he had his strong detractors. A &quot;New York Times&quot; review in 1898 of his novel &quot;The Intruder&quot; referred to him as &quot;evil&quot;, &quot;entirely selfish and corrupt&quot;. Three weeks into its December 1901 run at the Teatro Constanzi in Rome, his tragedy &quot;Francesca da Rimini&quot; was banned by the censor on grounds of morality.

A prolific writer, D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s novels in Italian include (&quot;The Child of Pleasure&quot;, 1889), (&quot;The Triumph of Death&quot;, 1894), and (&quot;The Maidens of the Rocks&quot;, 1896). He wrote the screenplay to the feature film &quot;Cabiria&quot; (1914) based on episodes from the Second Punic War. D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s literary creations were strongly influenced by the French Symbolist school, and contain episodes of striking violence and depictions of abnormal mental states interspersed with gorgeously imagined scenes. One of D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s most significant novels, scandalous in its day, is &quot;Il fuoco&quot; (&quot;The Flame of Life&quot;) of 1900, in which he portrays himself as the Nietzschean Superman (&quot;Übermensch&quot;) Stelio Effrena, in a fictionalized account of his love affair with Eleonora Duse. His short stories showed the influence of Guy de Maupassant. He was also associated with the Italian noblewoman Luisa Casati, an influence on his novels and one of his mistresses.
The 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; wrote of him:
The work of d&#x27; Annunzio, although by many of the younger generation injudiciously and extravagantly admired, is almost the most important literary work given to Italy since the days when the great classics welded her varying dialects into a fixed language. The psychological inspiration of his novels has come to him from many sources—French, Russian, Scandinavian, German—and in much of his earlier work there is little fundamental originality.His creative power is intense and searching, but narrow and personal; his heroes and heroines are little more than one same type monotonously facing a different problem at a different phase of life. But the faultlessness of his style and the wealth of his language have been approached by none of his contemporaries, whom his genius has somewhat paralysed. In his later work [meaning as of 1911], when he begins drawing his inspiration from the traditions of bygone Italy in her glorious centuries, a current of real life seems to run through the veins of his personages. And the lasting merit of D&#x27;Annunzio, his real value to the literature of his country, consists precisely in that he opened up the closed mine of its former life as a source of inspiration for the present and of hope for the future, and created a language, neither pompous nor vulgar, drawn from every source and district suited to the requirements of modern thought, yet absolutely classical, borrowed from none, and, independently of the thought it may be used to express, a thing of intrinsic beauty. As his sight became clearer and his purpose strengthened, as exaggerations, affectations, and moods dropped away from his conceptions, his work became more and more typical Latin work, upheld by the ideal of an Italian Renaissance.

In Italy, some of D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s poetic works remain popular, most notably his poem &quot;La pioggia nel pineto&quot; (&quot;The Rain in the Pinewood&quot;), which exemplifies his linguistic virtuosity as well as the sensuousness of his poetry. His work was part of the literature event in the art competition at the 1912 Summer Olympics.

== Museums ==
D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s life and work are commemorated in a museum, &quot;Il Vittoriale degli Italiani&quot; (&quot;The Shrine of the Italian People&#x27;s Victories&quot;). He planned and developed it himself, adjacent to his villa at Gardone Riviera on the southwest bank of Lake Garda, between 1923 and his death. Now a national monument, it is a complex of military museum, library, literary and historical archive, theatre, war memorial and mausoleum. The museum preserves his torpedo boat &quot;MAS 96&quot; and the SVA-5 aircraft he flew over Vienna. His birthplace is also open to the public as a museum, Birthplace of Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio Museum in Pescara.

== Legacy ==
The D&#x27;Annunzio University of Chieti–Pescara is named after him, as is the Brescia Airport. The Chilean poetess Lucila Godoy Alcayaga, 1945 Nobel Prize in Literature, took the first name of her pseudonym, Gabriela Mistral, in his honour. The play &quot;Tamara&quot; is based on his meeting with the painter Tamara de Lempicka. Luchino Visconti&#x27;s last film, &quot;The Innocent&quot;, is based on D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s novel. The writer Ernesto Giménez Caballero was given the nickname the &quot;Spanish D&#x27;Annunzio&quot;.

<doc id="47411" wikidata="Q231145" url="?curid=47411" title="Margaret of Anjou">
<text>Margaret of Anjou (; 23 March 1430 – 25 August 1482) was Queen of England by marriage to King Henry VI from 1445 to 1461 and again from 1470 to 1471. Through marriage, she was also nominally Queen of France from 1445 to 1453. Born in the Duchy of Lorraine into the House of Valois-Anjou, Margaret was the second eldest daughter of René of Anjou King of Naples, and Isabella, Duchess of Lorraine.

Margaret was one of the principal figures in the series of dynastic civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses and at times personally led the Lancastrian faction. Some of her contemporaries, such as the Duke of Suffolk, praised &quot;her valiant courage and undaunted spirit&quot; and the 16th-century historian Edward Hall described her personality in these terms: &quot;This woman excelled all other, as well in beauty and favour, as in wit and policy, and was of stomach and courage, more like to a man, than a woman&quot;.

Owing to her husband&#x27;s frequent bouts of insanity, Margaret ruled the kingdom in his place. It was she who called for a Great Council in May 1455 that excluded the Yorkist faction headed by Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York. This provided the spark that ignited a civil conflict that lasted for more than 30 years, decimated the old nobility of England, and caused the deaths of thousands of men, including her only son, Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, at the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471.

Margaret was taken prisoner by the victorious Yorkists after the Lancastrian defeat at Tewkesbury. In 1475, she was ransomed by her cousin, King Louis XI of France. She went to live in France as a poor relation of the French king, and she died there at the age of 52.

== Early life and marriage ==
=== Childhood ===
Margaret was born on 23 March 1430 at Pont-à-Mousson in Lorraine, a fief of the Holy Roman Empire east of France ruled by a cadet branch of the French kings, the House of Valois-Anjou. Margaret was the second daughter of René of Anjou, and of Isabella, Duchess of Lorraine. She had five brothers and four sisters, as well as three half-siblings from her father&#x27;s relationships with mistresses. Her father, popularly known as &quot;Good King René&quot; (Bon Roi René), was duke of Anjou and titular king of Naples, Sicily, and Jerusalem; he has been described as &quot;a man of many crowns but no kingdoms&quot;. Margaret was baptised at Toul in Lorraine and, in the care of her father&#x27;s old nurse Theophanie la Magine, she spent her early years at the castle at Tarascon on the river Rhône in Provence and in the old royal palace at Capua, near Naples in the Kingdom of Sicily. Her mother took care of her education and may have arranged for her to have lessons with the scholar Antoine de la Sale, who taught her brothers. In childhood, Margaret was known as &quot;la petite créature&quot; (the little creature) and was interested in French romances and hunting.

Her family included several prominent women who exercised power in politics, war, and administration as regents and queen-lieutenants. Her mother, Isabella of Lorraine, fought wars on behalf of her husband while he was imprisoned in 1431-1432 and 1434-1436 by the duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good, and ruled the Duchy of Lorraine in her own right. Her paternal grandmother, Yolande of Aragon, ruled the Duchy of Anjou as regent for her son while Margaret was a child, repelling an English military presence and supporting the disinherited Charles VII of France (Dauphin). It has been suggested that this family example provided her with precedents for her later actions as regent for her son. Attitudes to women&#x27;s exercise of power were different in Western Europe than in England at the time, with England more opposed to women exercising authority.

=== Marriage, concession of Maine, and subsequent rule ===
Margaret met with English envoys at Tours on 4 May 1444 to discuss her marriage to Henry VI of England. On 24 May, she was formally betrothed to Henry by proxy. Her uncle, Charles VII of France, who may have suggested the marriage as part of peace efforts between France and England near the conclusion of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, was present. The marriage was negotiated principally by William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, and the settlement included a remarkably small dowry of 20,000 francs and the unrealised claim, via Margaret&#x27;s mother, to the territories of Mallorca and Menorca, which had been occupied for centuries by the Crown of Aragon. The marriage settlement also contained the promise of a twenty-three-month truce with France. Opinions were mixed as to the wisdom of the marriage, but the prevailing understanding was that it represented a genuine effort at peace.


Loans were taken out by the government in order to pay for the considerable expense of transporting Margaret to England. Solicitation for the loans emphasised the rôle that the marriage, and Margaret herself, would play in seeking peace with France. This was a theme that continued throughout the preparations for her wedding. She arrived in England on 9 April 1445 and travelled to London accompanied by various lords and courtiers. She reached London on 28 May, where she was met by the mayor and aldermen of the city. The predicted turnout for her arrival and procession was so large that on 8 May, an inspection of roofs and balconies was ordered due to the expectation that spectators would use them as vantage points for her progress.

Her ceremonial progress through the city lasted two days, the intervening night spent, by custom, in the Tower of London. It was accompanied by eight theatrical pageants. Five of these pageants concerned the peace with France, casting Margaret as a symbol of, or the agent of, peace. Three spoke of her spiritual role as a redeemer and intercessor. It is uncertain whether these pageants represented a propaganda effort on the part of the Crown or reflected popular sentiment.

On 23 April 1445, Margaret married King Henry VI of England at Titchfield Abbey in Hampshire. She was fifteen and he was twenty-three. She was then crowned Queen of England on 30 May 1445 at Westminster Abbey by John Stafford, Archbishop of Canterbury. Those that anticipated the future return of English claims to French territory believed that she already understood her duty to protect the interests of the Crown fervently. The wedding and her transport were very expensive, estimated by some historians at more than £5,000.

Shortly after her coronation, René of Anjou entered negotiations with the English crown in an attempt to barter a lifetime&#x27;s alliance and a twenty-year truce in exchange for the cession of the English-held territory of Maine to Anjou and Henry&#x27;s agreement to abandon his claim to Anjou. Ultimately, the agreement ended without an alliance with Anjou and with the loss of Maine. Margaret, alongside Henry, corresponded closely with Charles VII regarding the agreement, attempting to act as a mediator.

The loss of Maine, regarded as a betrayal, was deeply unpopular with the English public, who were already inclined to mistrust Margaret due to her French origins. Blame was cast on William de la Pole, due to his rôle in negotiations. The reputation of Margaret&#x27;s marriage suffered as a result, although she herself was not openly blamed for the loss.

In the early years of their marriage, prior to Henry&#x27;s illness, Margaret and Henry spent significant proportions of their time together by choice. They shared an interest in education and culture. On 30 March 1448, she was granted licence to found Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge. Prior to 1453, there is little evidence of public political efforts on her part. Most of her surviving letters were written during that period, and the majority pertain to acts of intercession, mediation, and intervention in matters on which she had been asked to act, such as the arranging of marriages, the return of wrongfully taken property, and the collection of alms. These were expected and important parts of the rôle of a noblewoman or queen. Some were successful, and others regarded as high-handed or ill-thought-out. On one occasion, she recommended a man named Alexander Manning to the rôle of gaoler at Newgate; shortly after, he turned the prisoners loose in an act of protest at his rumoured dismissal for negligence and was then gaoled himself.

=== Birth of a son ===
Henry, who was more interested in religion and learning than in military matters, was not a successful king. He had reigned since he was only a few months old, and his actions had been controlled by protectors, magnates who were effectively regents. When he married Margaret, his mental condition was already unstable, and by the time of the birth of their only son, Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales (born 13 October 1453), he had suffered a complete breakdown.

== Beginnings of the dynastic civil wars ==
=== Enmity between Margaret and the Duke of York ===
After retiring from London to live in lavish state at Greenwich, Margaret was occupied with the care of her young son and did not display any political inclinations until she believed her husband was threatened with deposition by the ambitious Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, who, to her dismay, had been appointed Lord Protector while Henry was mentally incapacitated from 1453 to 1454. The duke was a credible claimant to the English throne, and by the end of his protectorship, there were many powerful nobles and relatives prepared to back his claim. Whereas the Duke of York was ambitious and capable, Henry (surrounded by corrupt advisers) was trusting, pliable, and increasingly unstable. Margaret herself was defiantly unpopular, grimly and gallantly determined to maintain the English crown for her progeny. Yet at least one scholar identifies the source of the eventual Lancastrian downfall not as York&#x27;s ambitions nearly so much as Margaret&#x27;s ill-judged enmity toward York and her over-indulgence in unpopular allies. Nevertheless, Queen Margaret was a powerful force in the world of politics..

Margaret&#x27;s biographer Helen Maurer, however, disagrees with earlier historians having dated the much-vaunted enmity between the Queen and York to the time he obtained the office of the protectorship. She suggests the mutual antagonism came about two years later in 1455 in the wake of the First Battle of St Albans, when Margaret perceived him as a challenge to the king&#x27;s authority. Maurer bases this conclusion on a judicious study of Margaret&#x27;s pattern of presenting gifts; this revealed that Margaret took a great deal of care to demonstrate that she favoured both York and Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, equally in the early 1450s. Maurer also claims that Margaret appeared to accept York&#x27;s protectorship and asserts there is no substantial evidence to back up the long-standing belief that she was responsible for the Yorkists&#x27; exclusion from the Great Council following Henry&#x27;s recovery (see below).

The late historian Paul Murray Kendall, on the other hand, maintained that Margaret&#x27;s allies Edmund Beaufort and William de la Pole, then Earl of Suffolk, had no difficulty in persuading her that York, until then one of Henry VI&#x27;s most trusted advisers, was responsible for her unpopularity and already too powerful to be trusted. Margaret not only persuaded Henry to recall York from his post as governor in France and banish him instead to Ireland, she also repeatedly attempted to have him assassinated during his travels to and from Ireland, once in 1449 and again in 1450. Edmund Beaufort and Suffolk&#x27;s joint responsibility for the secret surrender of Maine in 1448, and then the subsequent disastrous loss of the rest of Normandy in 1449 embroiled Margaret and Henry&#x27;s court in riots, uprisings by the magnates, and calls for the impeachment and execution of Margaret&#x27;s two strongest allies. It also might have made an ultimate battle to the death between Margaret and the House of York inevitable by making manifest Richard&#x27;s dangerous popularity with the Commons. Richard of York safely returned from Ireland in 1450, confronted Henry, and was readmitted as a trusted advisor. Soon thereafter, Henry agreed to convene Parliament to address the calls for reform. When Parliament met, the demands could not have been less acceptable to Margaret: not only were both Edmund Beaufort and Suffolk impeached for criminal mismanagement of French affairs and subverting justice, but it was charged as a crime against Suffolk (now a duke) that he had antagonised the king against the Duke of York. Further, the demands for reform put forward included that the Duke of York be acknowledged as the first councillor to the king, and the Speaker of Commons, perhaps with more fervour than wisdom, even proposed Richard, Duke of York, be recognised as heir to the throne. Within a few months, however, Margaret had regained control of Henry, Parliament was dissolved, the incautious Speaker thrown in prison, and Richard of York retired to Wales for the time being.

In 1457, the kingdom was again outraged when it was discovered that Pierre de Brézé, a powerful French general and an adherent of Margaret, had landed on the English coast and burnt the town of Sandwich. As leader of a French force of 4,000 men from Honfleur, he aimed at taking advantage of the chaos in England. The mayor, John Drury, was killed in this raid. It thereafter became an established tradition, which survives to this day, that the Mayor of Sandwich wears a black robe mourning this ignoble deed. Margaret, in association with de Brézé, became the object of scurrilous rumours and vulgar ballads. Public indignation was so high that Margaret, with great reluctance, was forced to give the Duke of York&#x27;s kinsman Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, a commission to keep the sea for three years. He already held the post of Captain of Calais.

=== Leader of Lancastrian faction ===
Hostilities between the rival Yorkist and Lancastrian factions soon flared into armed conflict. In May 1455, just over five months after Henry VI recovered from a bout of mental illness and Richard of York&#x27;s protectorship had ended, Margaret and Henry called for a Great Council from which the Yorkists were excluded. The Council called for an assemblage of the peers at Leicester with the stated purpose to protect the king from his enemies. York, fearing that the purpose of the council was to destroy him, prepared for battle and soon was marching south to meet the Lancastrian army marching north. The Lancastrians suffered a crushing defeat at the First Battle of St Albans on 22 May 1455. Edmund Beaufort, the Earl of Northumberland and Lord Clifford were killed, Wiltshire fled the battlefield, and King Henry was taken prisoner by the victorious Duke of York. In March 1458, along with her husband and leading nobles of the warring factions, she took part in The Love Day procession in London.

In 1459, hostilities resumed at the Battle of Blore Heath, where James Tuchet, 5th Baron Audley, was defeated and killed by the Yorkist army under the command of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury. The battle had only just begun.

== The Wars of the Roses ==
=== Early campaigns ===
While Margaret was attempting to raise further support for the Lancastrian cause in Scotland, her principal commander, Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset, gained a major victory for her at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460 by defeating the combined armies of the Duke of York and the Earl of Salisbury. Both men were beheaded and their heads displayed on the gates of the city of York. As Margaret was in Scotland at the time of the battle, it was impossible that she issued the orders for their execution, despite popular belief to the contrary. Next was the Second Battle of St Albans (at which she was present) on 17 February 1461. In this battle, she defeated the Yorkist forces of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, and recaptured her husband. After this battle, she ordered the execution of two Yorkist prisoners of war, William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville, the rival of the loyal Lancastrian, the Earl of Devon, and Sir Thomas Kyriell. Both men had kept watch over King Henry, a prisoner to Warwick, to keep him out of harm&#x27;s way during the battle. The king had promised the two knights immunity, but Margaret gainsaid him and ordered their execution by decapitation. It is alleged that she put the men on trial with her son presiding. &quot;Fair son&quot;, she allegedly asked, &quot;what death shall these knights die?&quot; Prince Edward replied that their heads should be cut off, despite the king&#x27;s pleas for mercy.

=== Sojourn in France ===
The Lancastrian army was beaten at the Battle of Towton on 29 March 1461 by the son of the late Duke of York, the future Edward IV of England, who deposed King Henry and proclaimed himself king. Margaret was determined to win back her son&#x27;s inheritance and fled with him into Wales and later Scotland. Finding her way to France, she made an ally of her cousin, King Louis XI of France, and at his instigation, she allowed an approach from Edward&#x27;s former supporter, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, who had fallen out with his former friend as a result of Edward&#x27;s marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, and was now seeking revenge for the loss of his political influence. Warwick&#x27;s daughter, Anne Neville, was married to Margaret&#x27;s son Edward, Prince of Wales, in order to cement the alliance, and Margaret insisted that Warwick return to England to prove himself before she followed. He did so, restoring Henry VI briefly to the throne on 3 October 1470.

=== Final defeat at Tewkesbury ===
By the time Margaret, her son and daughter-in-law Anne were ready to follow Warwick back to England, the tables had again turned in favour of the Yorkists, and the Earl was defeated and killed by the returning King Edward IV in the Battle of Barnet on 14 April 1471. Margaret was forced to lead her own army at the Battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May 1471, at which the Lancastrian forces were defeated and her seventeen-year-old son Edward of Westminster was killed. The circumstances of Edward&#x27;s death have never been made clear; it is not known whether he was killed in the actual fighting or executed after the battle by the Duke of Clarence. Over the previous ten years, Margaret had gained a reputation for aggression and ruthlessness, but following her defeat at Tewkesbury and the death of her only son, she was completely broken in spirit. After she was taken captive by William Stanley at the end of the battle, Margaret was imprisoned by the order of King Edward. She was sent first to Wallingford Castle and then was transferred to the more secure Tower of London. Henry VI was also imprisoned in the Tower in the wake of Tewkesbury and he died there on the night of 21 May; the cause of his death is unknown, though regicide was suspected, specifically smothering in his sleep. In 1472 she was placed in the custody of her former lady-in-waiting Alice Chaucer, Duchess of Suffolk, where she remained until ransomed by Louis XI of France in 1475.

== Final years and death ==
Margaret lived in France for seven years as a poor relation of the King. She was hosted by Francis de Vignolles and died, impoverished, in his castle of Dampierre-sur-Loire, near Anjou on 25 August 1482 at the age of 52. She was entombed next to her parents in Angers Cathedral, but her remains were removed and scattered by revolutionaries who ransacked the cathedral during the French Revolution.

== Legacy ==
Many letters written by Margaret during her tenure as queen consort are still extant. One was written to the Corporation of London regarding injuries inflicted on her tenants at the manor of Enfield, which comprised part of her dower lands. Another letter was written to the Archbishop of Canterbury. Margaret&#x27;s letters, which typically began with the words &quot;By the Quene&quot;, are compiled in a book edited by Cecil Munro published for the Camden Society in 1863.

Elizabeth Woodville (born ca 1437), later Queen of England as the wife of Margaret&#x27;s husband&#x27;s rival, King Edward IV, purportedly served Margaret of Anjou as a maid of honour. However, the evidence is too scanty to permit historians to establish this with absolute certainty; several women at Margaret&#x27;s court bore the name Elizabeth or Isabella Grey.

=== In William Shakespeare ===
Margaret is a major character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s first tetralogy of History plays. &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;, &quot;Part 2&quot;, &quot;Part 3&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;. She is the only character to appear alive in all four plays, but due to the length of the plays, many of her lines are usually cut in modern adaptations. Shakespeare portrays Margaret as an intelligent, ruthless woman who easily dominates her husband and fiercely vies for power with her enemies. In &quot;Henry VI, Part 2&quot; Margaret has an affair with the Duke of Suffolk and mourns his death by carrying around his severed head. In &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot; Richard Plantagenet Duke of York famously calls her &quot;She-wolf of France/ but worse than wolves of France/ Whose tongue more poisons than the adder&#x27;s tooth!&quot; Later, she personally stabs the Duke of York on the battlefield after humiliatingly taunting him and becomes suicidal when her son Edward is killed in front of her. Although in reality, Margaret spent the rest of her life outside England after the death of her husband and son, Shakespeare has her return to the court in &quot;Richard III&quot;. Margaret serves as a Cassandra-like prophetess; in her first appearance she dramatically curses the majority of the nobles for their roles in the downfall of the House of Lancaster. All of her curses come to pass as the noblemen are betrayed and executed by Richard of Gloucester, and each character reflects on her curse before his execution. Shakespeare had famously described Margaret: &quot;How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex/ To triumph like an Amazonian trull/ Upon their woes whom Fortune captivates&quot;.

Margaret&#x27;s prominence in Shakespeare has led many theatre-makers to interpret the story with her at the centre, drawing from the plays she is featured in. An adaptation called &quot;Margaret of Anjou&quot; by Elizabeth Schafer and Philippa Kelly was performed in 2016 in London by By Jove Theatre Company and an adaptation of the three Henry VI plays and Richard III entitled &quot;War of the Roses&quot; by Eric Ting and Philippa Kelly at California Shakespeare Theatre in 2018 gave Margaret great prominence. In 2018, the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester premiered &quot;Queen Margaret&quot;, using all the lines spoken by Margaret over the four plays with additional material by playwright Jeanie O&#x27;Hare.

=== In historical fiction ===
Margaret of Anjou appears in many novels of historical fiction.

Margaret is the main subject of:
* &quot;Red Rose of Anjou&quot; by Jean Plaidy
* &quot;The Queen of Last Hopes&quot; by Susan Higginbotham
* &quot;Blood and Roses&quot; by Catherine Hokin

Margaret also appears as a secondary or minor character in:
* &quot;The Lady of the Rivers&quot; by Philippa Gregory
* &quot;The Kingmaker’s Daughter&quot; by Philippa Gregory

=== In TV ===
* In the 1965-1966 filmed theatre production series &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot; Margaret featured in 7 of 11 episodes and was played by Peggy Ascroft.
* In the 2013 BBC series &quot;The White Queen&quot; Margaret was portrayed by Veerle Baetens.
* In &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot;, the 2012-2016 BBC adaption of Shakespeare&#x27;s history plays, Margaret was played by Sophie Okonedo.

<text>Group psychotherapy or group therapy is a form of psychotherapy in which one or more therapists treat a small group of clients together as a group. The term can legitimately refer to any form of psychotherapy when delivered in a group format, including art therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy, but it is usually applied to psychodynamic group therapy where the group context and group process is explicitly utilized as a mechanism of change by developing, exploring and examining interpersonal relationships within the group.

The broader concept of &quot;group therapy&quot; can be taken to include any helping process that takes place in a group, including support groups, skills training groups (such as anger management, mindfulness, relaxation training or social skills training), and psychoeducation groups. The differences between psychodynamic groups, activity groups, support groups, problem-solving and psychoeducational groups have been discussed by psychiatrist Charles Montgomery. Other, more specialized forms of group therapy would include non-verbal expressive therapies such as art therapy, dance therapy, or music therapy.

==History==
The founders of group psychotherapy in the United States were Joseph H. Pratt, Trigant Burrow and Paul Schilder. All three of them were active and working at the East Coast in the first half of the 20th century. In 1932 Jacob L. Moreno presented his work on group psychotherapy to the American Psychiatric Association, and co-authored a monograph on the subject. After World War II, group psychotherapy was further developed by Moreno, Samuel Slavson, Hyman Spotnitz, Irvin Yalom, and Lou Ormont. Yalom&#x27;s approach to group therapy has been very influential not only in the USA but across the world.

An early development in group therapy was the T-group or training group (sometimes also referred to as sensitivity-training group, human relations training group or encounter group), a form of group psychotherapy where participants (typically, between eight and 15 people) learn about themselves (and about small group processes in general) through their interaction with each other. They use feedback, problem solving, and role play to gain insights into themselves, others, and groups. It was pioneered in the mid-1940s by Kurt Lewin and Carl Rogers and his colleagues as a method of learning about human behavior in what became the National Training Laboratories (also known as the NTL Institute) that was created by the Office of Naval Research and the National Education Association in Bethel, Maine, in 1947.

Moreno developed a specific and highly structured form of group therapy known as psychodrama (although the entry on psychodrama claims it is not a form of group therapy). Another recent development in the theory and method of group psychotherapy based on an integration of systems thinking is Yvonne Agazarian&#x27;s systems-centered therapy (SCT), which sees groups functioning within the principles of system dynamics. Her method of &quot;functional subgrouping&quot; introduces a method of organizing group communication so it is less likely to react counterproductively to differences. SCT also emphasizes the need to recognize the phases of group development and the defenses related to each phase in order to best make sense and influence group dynamics.

In the United Kingdom group psychotherapy initially developed independently, with pioneers S. H. Foulkes and Wilfred Bion using group therapy as an approach to treating combat fatigue in the Second World War. Foulkes and Bion were psychoanalysts and incorporated psychoanalysis into group therapy by recognising that transference can arise not only between group members and the therapist but also among group members. Furthermore, the psychoanalytic concept of the unconscious was extended with a recognition of a group unconscious, in which the unconscious processes of group members could be acted out in the form of irrational processes in group sessions. Foulkes developed the model known as group analysis and the Institute of Group Analysis, while Bion was influential in the development of group therapy at the Tavistock Clinic.

Bion&#x27;s approach is comparable to social therapy, first developed in the United States in the late 1970s by Lois Holzman and Fred Newman, which is a group therapy in which practitioners relate to the group, not its individuals, as the fundamental unit of development. The task of the group is to &quot;build the group&quot; rather than focus on problem solving or &quot;fixing&quot; individuals.

In Argentina an independent school of group analysis stemmed from the work and teachings of Swiss-born Argentine psychoanalyst Enrique Pichon-Rivière. This thinker conceived of a group-centered approach which, although not directly influenced by Foulkes&#x27; work, was fully compatible with it.

==Therapeutic principles==
Irvin Yalom proposed a number of therapeutic factors (originally termed &quot;curative factors&quot; but renamed &quot;therapeutic&quot; factors in the 5th edition of &quot;The Theory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy&quot; (1st edition 1970, 5th edition 2005).
* Universality
:The recognition of shared experiences and feelings among group members and that these may be widespread or universal human concerns, serves to remove a group member&#x27;s sense of isolation, validate their experiences, and raise self-esteem
* Altruism
:The group is a place where members can help each other, and the experience of being able to give something to another person can lift the member&#x27;s self esteem and help develop more adaptive coping styles and interpersonal skills.
* Instillation of hope
:In a mixed group that has members at various stages of development or recovery, a member can be inspired and encouraged by another member who has overcome the problems with which they are still struggling.
* Imparting information
:While this is not strictly speaking a psychotherapeutic process, members often report that it has been very helpful to learn factual information from other members in the group. For example, about their treatment or about access to services.
* Corrective recapitulation of the primary family experience
:Members often unconsciously identify the group therapist and other group members with their own parents and siblings in a process that is a form of transference specific to group psychotherapy. The therapist&#x27;s interpretations can help group members gain understanding of the impact of childhood experiences on their personality, and they may learn to avoid unconsciously repeating unhelpful past interactive patterns in present-day relationships.
* Development of socializing techniques
:The group setting provides a safe and supportive environment for members to take risks by extending their repertoire of interpersonal behaviour and improving their social skills
* Imitative behaviour
:One way in which group members can develop social skills is through a modeling process, observing and imitating the therapist and other group members. For example, sharing personal feelings, showing concern, and supporting others.
* Cohesiveness
:It has been suggested that this is the primary therapeutic factor from which all others flow. Humans are herd animals with an instinctive need to belong to groups, and personal development can only take place in an interpersonal context. A cohesive group is one in which all members feel a sense of belonging, acceptance, and validation.
* Existential factors
:Learning that one has to take responsibility for one&#x27;s own life and the consequences of one&#x27;s decisions.
* Catharsis
:Catharsis is the experience of relief from emotional distress through the free and uninhibited expression of emotion. When members tell their story to a supportive audience, they can obtain relief from chronic feelings of shame and guilt.
* Interpersonal learning
:Group members achieve a greater level of self-awareness through the process of interacting with others in the group, who give feedback on the member&#x27;s behaviour and impact on others.
* Self-understanding
:This factor overlaps with interpersonal learning but refers to the achievement of greater levels of insight into the genesis of one&#x27;s problems and the unconscious motivations that underlie one&#x27;s behaviour.

==Settings==
Group therapy can form part of the therapeutic milieu of a psychiatric in-patient unit or ambulatory psychiatric partial hospitalization (also known as day hospital treatment).
In addition to classical &quot;talking&quot; therapy, group therapy in an institutional setting can also include group-based expressive therapies such as drama therapy, psychodrama, art therapy, and non-verbal types of therapy such as music therapy and dance/movement therapy.

Group psychotherapy is a key component of milieu therapy in a therapeutic community. The total environment or milieu is regarded as the medium of therapy, all interactions and activities regarded as potentially therapeutic and are subject to exploration and interpretation, and are explored in daily or weekly community meetings. However, interactions between the culture of group psychotherapeutic settings and the more managerial norms of external authorities may create &#x27;organizational turbulence&#x27; which can critically undermine a group&#x27;s ability to maintain a safe yet challenging &#x27;formative space&#x27;. Academics at the University of Oxford studied the inter-organizational dynamics of a national democratic therapeutic community over a period of four years; they found external steering by authorities eroded the community&#x27;s therapeutic model, produced a crisis, and led to an intractable conflict which resulted in the community&#x27;s closure.

A form of group therapy has been reported to be effective in psychotic adolescents and recovering addicts. Projective psychotherapy uses an outside text such as a novel or motion picture to provide a &quot;stable delusion&quot; for the former cohort and a safe focus for repressed and suppressed emotions or thoughts in the latter. Patient groups read a novel or collectively view a film. They then participate collectively in the discussion of plot, character motivation and author motivation. In the case of films, sound track, cinematography and background are also discussed and processed. Under the guidance of the therapist, defense mechanisms are bypassed by the use of signifiers and semiotic processes. The focus remains on the text rather than on personal issues. It was popularized in the science fiction novel, &quot;Red Orc&#x27;s Rage&quot;.

Group therapy is now often utilized in private practice settings.

Group analysis has become widespread in Europe, and especially the United Kingdom, where it has become the most common form of group psychotherapy. Interest from Australia, the former Soviet Union and the African continent is also growing.

Psychedelic-assisted group psychotherapy can be more cost-efficient in comparison to individual psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy models, because therapists can split the costs among all participants of the group.

==Research on effectiveness==
A 2008 meta-analysis found that individual therapy may be slightly more effective than group therapy initially, but this difference seems to disappear after 6 months. There is clear evidence for the effectiveness of group psychotherapy for depression: a meta-analysis of 48 studies showed an overall effect size of 1.03, which is clinically highly significant. Similarly, a meta-analysis of five studies of group psychotherapy for adult sexual abuse survivors showed moderate to strong effect sizes, and there is also good evidence for effectiveness with chronic traumatic stress in war veterans.

There is less robust evidence of good outcomes for patients with borderline personality disorder, with some studies showing only small to moderate effect sizes. The authors comment that these poor outcomes might reflect a need for additional support for some patients, in addition to the group therapy. This is borne out by the impressive results obtained using mentalization-based treatment, a model that combines dynamic group psychotherapy with individual psychotherapy and case management.

Most outcome research is carried out using time-limited therapy with diagnostically homogenous groups. However, long-term intensive interactional group psychotherapy assumes diverse and diagnostically heterogeneous group membership, and an open-ended time scale for therapy. Good outcomes have also been demonstrated for this form of group therapy.

== Computer-supported group therapy ==
Research on computer-supported and computer-based interventions has increased significantly since the mid-1990s. For a comprehensive overview of current practices see: Computer-supported psychotherapy.

Several feasibility studies examined the impact of computer-, app- and media-support on group interventions. Most investigated interventions implemented short rationales, which usually were based on principles of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). Most research focussed on:

* Anxiety disorders (e.g. social phobia, generalised anxiety disorder ) 
* Depression (e.g. mild to moderate Major Depression)
* Other disorders (e.g. hoarding)

While the evidence base for group therapy is very limited, preliminary research in individual therapy suggests possible increases of treatment efficiency or effectiveness. Further, the use of app- or computer-based monitoring has been investigated several times. Reported advantages of the modern format include improved between-session transfer and patient-therapist-communication, as well as increased treatment transparency and intensity. Negative effects may occur in terms of dissonance due to non-compliance with online tasks, or the constriction of in-session group interaction. Last but not least, group phenomena might influence the motivation to engage with online tasks.

<text>A convenience store, convenience shop, bodega, corner store, corner shop, superette or mini-mart is a small retail store that stocks a range of everyday items such as convenience food, groceries, beverages, tobacco products, lottery tickets, over-the-counter drugs, toiletries, newspapers and magazines.

In some jurisdictions, convenience stores (such as off-licences in the UK) are licensed to sell alcoholic drinks, although many other jurisdictions limit such beverages to those with relatively low alcohol content, like beer and wine. The stores may also offer money order and wire transfer services, along with the use of a fax machine or photocopier for a small per-copy cost. Some also sell tickets or recharge smart cards, e.g. Opus cards in Montreal, Canada, or include a small deli. They differ from general stores and village shops in that they are not in a rural location and are used as a convenient (hence their common name) supplement to larger stores.

A convenience store may be part of a gas/petrol station, so customers can purchase goods while refuelling their vehicle. It may be located alongside a busy road, in an urban area, near a railway or railroad station or other transport hub. In some countries, convenience stores have long shopping hours and some remain open 24 hours.

Convenience stores often charge significantly higher prices than conventional grocery stores or supermarkets, as they buy smaller quantities of inventory at higher per-unit prices from wholesalers. Customers benefit from their longer opening hours, more convenient and greater number of locations and shorter cashier lines.

==Terminology==
A convenience store may also be called a cold store, party store (Michigan), bodega (New York City), carry out, mini-market, mini-mart, corner shop, deli or milk bar (Australia), dairy (New Zealand), superette (New Zealand, parts of Canada, and in parts of the US), corner store (many parts of English-speaking Canada and New England), a späti (from &#x27;spätkauf&#x27; (lit. &#x27;buy-late&#x27;) in Germany, a konbini in Japan, based on the English loanword &#x27;convenience&#x27;, dépanneur or dep (used in Canada, primarily Quebec, in both English and French. It is a loanword from the French &#x27;troubleshooter&#x27;).

==Merchandise==
Various types include, for example, liquor stores (off-licences-offices), mini-markets (mini-marts), general stores or party stores. Typically confectionery (sweets, ice cream, soft drinks), lottery tickets, newspapers and magazines are sold, although merchandise varies widely from store to store. Unless the outlet is a liquor store, the range of alcoholic beverages is likely to be limited (i.e. beer and wine) or non-existent. Most stores sell cigarettes and other tobacco products (e.g. cigarette papers, pipe tobacco, cigars and e-liquid for e-cigarettes). In many North American jurisdictions, tobacco products comprise the greatest portion of gross sales at convenience stores, between 25% and 35%.

Varying degrees of food and grocery supplies are usually available, from household products to prepackaged foods like sandwiches and frozen burritos. Automobile-related items—such as motor oil, maps and car kits—may be sold. Often toiletries and other hygiene products are stocked, as well as sanitary products and contraception. Stores may carry apparel, home furnishings, CDs, and DVDs. Some stores offer money orders and wire transfer services. They may carry small appliances, as well as other household items such as coolers and backpacks. Convenience stores have also been known to carry candles, stationery, artwork, and crockery.

Many convenience shops offer ready-to-eat food, such as breakfast sandwiches and fry-ups. Throughout Europe, it is now common for convenience stores to sell fresh French bread (or similar). A process of freezing parbaked bread allows easy shipment (often from France) and baking in-store. Some shops have a delicatessen counter, offering custom-made sandwiches and baguettes. Others have racks offering fresh delivered or baked doughnuts from local doughnut shops. Some shops have a self-service microwave oven for heating purchased food.

Fast food items are often available, with stores offering such food either under its owner banner or in partnership with a fast-food chain maintaining a counter in the store. To save space, food is not prepared in the store. Instead, these counters offer a limited menu of items delivered several times a day from a local branch of the restaurant, with items intended to be served hot either kept hot under a warming device or reheated as ordered.

Convenience stores may be combined with other services, such as general stores and pawn shops, a ticket counter for purchasing railway tickets, a post office counter, or gasoline pumps. In Asian countries like Japan or Taiwan, convenience stores are more common because of the higher population density. They are found with gasoline and train stations, but also can be stand-alone stores. Items such as soft drinks or snacks, hot dogs, sausages and fish cakes can be found in these stores. Delicatessens are absent; instead, pre-made sandwiches are available. Non-consumables such as magazines are also sold, but to a lesser degree. Many convenience stores have a beverage fountain that offers coffee, soft drinks, and frozen beverages.

Stores often stock fast-moving consumer goods; items with a high turnover are preferred over items with a lower sales rate. The smaller convenience stores typically have few perishable items because it is not economically viable to rotate perishables frequently with a low number of staff. Smaller convenience stores also do not generate the business needed to sustain food spoilage rates typical of grocery stores or supermarkets. As such, products with a long shelf life are the rule, unless a product is specifically aimed at attracting customers on the chance they may buy something profitable, too.

==Differences from supermarkets==

Although larger, newer convenience stores may have a wide range of items, the selection is still limited compared to supermarkets, and in many stores only one or two choices are available. Prices in a convenience store are often higher than those at a supermarket, mass merchandise store or auto supply store, as convenience stores order smaller quantities of inventory at higher per-unit prices from wholesalers. Some convenience stores are similar to corner markets, but often have less variety in food.

Product containers in a convenience store are often smaller with reduced product quantity to allow more products on the store shelves. This reduces the apparent cost differences between full-size packaging in supermarkets. Reduced packaging also reduces waste when a traveller such as a hotel guest does not want to or cannot carry leftover product with them when they depart.

The average U.S. convenience store has a sales area of . New stores average about of sales area and about of non-sales area—a nod to retailers recognising the importance of creating destinations within the store that require additional space—whether coffee islands, food service areas with seating, or financial services kiosks. Convenience stores have expanded their offerings over the last few years, with stores becoming a part-supermarket, restaurant, gas station and even a bank or drug store.

In the United States, convenience stores are sometimes the only businesses near an interstate highway exit where drivers can buy any kind of food or drink for miles. Most of the profit margin from these stores comes from beer, liquor and cigarettes. Although those three categories themselves usually yield lower margins per item, the sales volume in them generally compensates for it. Profits per item are much higher on deli items (bags of ice, chicken, etc.), but sales are generally lower. In some countries, convenience stores have longer shopping hours, some being open 24 hours.

==By country==

===Australia===

The Australasian Association of Convenience Stores (AACS), the peak body for Australian convenience stores, defines a convenience store as a &quot;retail business with the primary emphasis placed on providing the public with a convenient location to quickly purchase from an array of consumable products, predominantly food and beverages, services as well as petrol.&quot; The product mix includes: food to go, beverages, dispensed/barista coffee, snacks (including confectionery), tobacco, basic groceries, ice, petrol and carwash. Stores may offer services such as ATMs, &quot;click &amp; collect&quot;, gas bottle exchange, money transfer and lottery tickets. A key feature of convenience stores is their extended hours of operation. Many are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

The majority of convenience stores in Australia are small businesses, being either independently owned or operated under franchise or licence agreement. The industry comprises over 6,000 stores and employs well over 40,000 people as of mid-2018. The Australian convenience channel merchandise sales are valued at $8.4 billion (excluding petrol sales) according to the AACS State of the Industry Report 2017. Australia has a flourishing convenience industry with a number of well-known convenience brands including: 7-Eleven, Ampol, NightOwl, Ezymart, BP, APCO, Coles Express, OTR, Viva Energy, Freedom Fuels and Puma Energy.

===Canada===
Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., which operates Couche-Tard, Provi-Soir, Dépanneur 7, Circle K, Mac&#x27;s, Winks, and Becker&#x27;s, is the largest convenience store chain in Canada and receives its products through Core-Mark International, a North American distribution company specializing in fresh convenience. Another large chain is Quickie Mart (whose name predates the fictitious &quot;Kwik-E-Mart&quot; featured on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;). The world&#x27;s largest convenience retailer, 7-Eleven, has about 500 Canadian locations from British Columbia to Ontario. Worldwide, the highest number of the chain&#x27;s Slurpee beverages are sold in Winnipeg, Manitoba and the city has been awarded the title of the &quot;Slurpee Capital of the World&quot; for many years running. Marketing itself as &quot;more than just a convenience store&quot;, there are over 260 Hasty Market locations throughout Ontario and one in British Columbia.

In addition to chain convenience stores, there are also many independently owned convenience stores in Canada.

Convenience stores are also commonly referred to as &quot;corner stores&quot;, &quot;mini-marts&quot; or &quot;variety stores&quot; in some regions of Canada. In the French-speaking province of Quebec, a convenience store is known as a &quot;dépanneur&quot; or &quot;dep&quot; for short, even among some when speaking in English.

===Chile===
Chilean convenience stores are typically found at gas stations in most urban and near-urban areas on highways. Examples include Punto/Pronto (owned by Copec), Spacio 1 (Petrobras, formerly called Tigermarket and On The Run before Esso Chile was owned by Petrobras), Va y Ven (Terpel), Upa!, Upita! and Select (from Shell).

Other brands operating mostly in downtowns and middle- to upper-class neighborhoods are Ok! Market (owned by Unimarc), Big John and Oxxo (owned by FEMSA) and some small-scale &quot;minisupermercados&quot; akin to mom and pop stores.

===Costa Rica===
In Costa Rica, family-owned and operated convenience stores called &quot;&quot; have been common since the 1900s, and there are many of those stores in every neighbourhood.

In the 2010s, modern convenience stores were introduced, mainly by the AMPM company. Competitors launched brands such as Musmanni Mini Super (a chain of bakery stores promoted to convenience stores), Vindi (operated by AutoMercado supermarket company) and Fresh Market (operated by AMPM in a format appealing to prosperous neighborhoods).

===Finland===

In Finland, convenience stores are referred to as kiosks, except for those found inside service stations, which are referred to simply as stores. The biggest convenience store chain is R-Kioski, with over 560 kiosks across the country, which are all franchise-licensed businesses. There are some independent convenience stores that use the word Kymppi or number 10 in their business name, which is reminiscent of a former large convenience store chain called 10-Kioski, which vanished around the early 2000s. Kymppi is a spoken colloquial word for number 10 (&quot;kymmenen&quot;) in Finnish.

Smaller towns often have independent kiosks. Convenience stores at service stations are run by either the station&#x27;s parent oil company such as Shell or by either of the two major retail corporations in Finland, Kesko or S Group. Virtually all staffed service stations have a small convenience store.

===France===
In France chain convenience stores are referred to as &quot;supérettes&quot;, implying they are mini-supermarkets. Brands include Carrefour City, Casino Shop, Coccimarket, Daily Monop&#x27;, Franprix, G20, Leader Price Express, Marché Plus, Sherpa, Sitis, Spar, Utile, Vival... (see ).

Some other, independent convenience shops are referred to as &quot;&quot; – &quot;Arab on the corner&quot;, due to many Arabic-speaking immigrants form Northwest Africa who work in this sector of the economy. These shops often stay open later than the &quot;épiceries&quot; or groceries, even on public holidays. Shop owners consider the name improper, especially those who come from other ethnic groups, including Imazighen. (See for more details on their ethnic origins.)

===Germany===

Berliners lovingly refer to the small neighbourhood shops with late opening times found throughout the city (often operated by families with immigrant roots, akin to France) as &quot;Späti&quot; (translating to &quot;Lat(e)y&quot;, derived from &quot;Spätkauf&quot;, &quot;late purchase&quot;).
In North Rhine-Westfalia people call the same kind of shop either &quot;Kiosk&quot;, like the Finnish, (using the word in a way differing from the rest of Germany, where &quot;Kiosk&quot; usually means only stall-like buildings or other very small window-selling shops which are not entered by customers and which sell either newspapers and magazines or snacks and cigarettes, or a combination of these, but no household goods) or &quot;Trinkhalle&quot; (&quot;drinking hall&quot;), although they are not pubs, as the name might suggest.

A name used for market stalls and also in some regions for little shops is &quot;Büdchen&quot; (from &quot;Bude&quot;, &quot;stall, hut, room&quot;); where no special local name for them exists, often just the equivalents of &quot;small shop&quot; or &quot;corner shop&quot; are used (&quot;der kleine Laden/ das Lädchen/ das Lädchen an der Ecke&quot;).

Snack shops integrated into petrol stations can also have long opening hours, but in contrast to the neighbourhood &quot;Späti&quot;-type shops, petrol station shops nowadays are usually part of large retail chains.

&quot;&quot; (aunt-Emma-shop) is used as a nostalgic term for old-fashioned general stores (typically family owned), the historic predecessors of modern discounters and supermarkets which they were replaced by (similar to mom-and-pop stores).

===India===
In India, &quot;mom-and-pop&quot; convenience stores are called kirana stores and constitute part of the traditional food retail system. Kirana are typically family-owned stores that operate in fixed locations and carry both basic food and non-food items.

===Indonesia===
Supermarket-styled convenience stores in Indonesia (commonly known as &quot;minimarket&quot;) are mostly scattered around the towns. Due to local government restrictions in Indonesia, usually convenience stores may only be built at least from the nearest traditional market. This allows traditional markets to continue selling local goods, but also greatly lowers the opportunities for profit by those who seek to build or own a convenience store by reducing the eligibility of property to be developed into a convenience store. This is especially true in small towns and rural areas. As a result, convenience stores in rural areas are often built side-by-side or at maximum within of each other.

The two major national convenience store chains in Indonesia are Indomaret and Alfamart, both of which serve almost all areas within the country with around 22,000 and 18,000 stores in 2023, respectively. Foreign chains like Family Mart, Circle K or Lawson, on the other hand, have their stores in big cities and cater to a specific lifestyle instead of focusing on &quot;convenience&quot;. To be classified as a convenience store, the store should occupy no more than of service area; in some local residences, the limit is .

The Indonesian government also regulates the convenience store license process, so it can only be bought by franchisees, using a different name and different brand, or classifying it as cafeteria. A convenience store with a cafeteria license is only allowed to sell a maximum 10% of its service space for non-food/beverages product. This type of convenience store often puts lawn chairs and a desk as a decoy in front of their stores, while offering the same range of products as a holder of a mini market license.

There are also many small neighborhood stores, known as &quot;toko kelontong&quot; or &quot;warung&quot;. Some are sponsored by a network of stores, mostly owned by cigarette companies (such as DRP by Djarum, GGSP by Gudang Garam or SRC by Sampoerna) or tech companies (such as Mitra Bukalapak or Mitra Tokopedia).

===Japan===

, often shortened to , developed at a tremendous rate in Japan. 7-Eleven Japan, while struggling to localize their service in the 1970s to 1980s, evolved its point of sale-based business, until ultimately, Seven &amp; I Holdings Co., the parent company of 7-Eleven Japan, acquired 7-Eleven (US) from Southland Corporation in 1991. Japanese-style convenience stores also heavily influenced those stores in other Asian regions or countries, such as Mainland China, Taiwan, Thailand, and South Korea.

Convenience stores rely heavily on the point of sale. Customers&#x27; ages and gender, as well as tomorrow&#x27;s weather forecast, are important data. Stores place all orders online. As store floor space is limited, they must be careful in choosing what brands to sell. In many cases, several stores from the same chain do business in neighboring areas. This strategy makes distribution to each store cheaper, as well as making multiple deliveries per day possible. Generally, food goods are delivered to each store two to five times a day from factories. Since products are delivered as needed, stores do not need large stock areas.

According to the Japan Franchise Association&#x27;s data for July 2021, there are 55,931 convenience stores in Japan. 7-Eleven leads the market with 12,467 stores, followed by: Lawson (9,562) and FamilyMart (7,604). Other operators include Circle K Sunkus (acquired by Family Mart in 2016; now defunct), Daily Yamazaki, Ministop, Am/Pm Japan (acquired by Family Mart in 2009; now defunct), Poplar, Coco Store (acquired by Family Mart in 2015; now defunct) and Seicomart. Many items available in larger supermarkets can be found in Japanese convenience stores, though the selection is usually smaller. As well, the following additional services are also commonly available:
* Courier and postal service.
* Photocopying and fax service.
* Automated teller machines.
* Payment service for utilities and other bills and taxes.
* Ticket service for concerts, theme parks, airlines etc.
* Pre-paid cards for cellular phones.

Some stores also sell charging service for electronic money and ATM services for credit card or consumer finance. Items not commonly sold include: Slurpees, lottery tickets, car supplies and gasoline.

Konbini also offer customers the option of making konbini payments (often also referred to as just konbini), an offline payment solution that allows customers without credit or debit cards to make online purchases. A consumer can buy online services or goods, such as video games on Steam or tickets for events. By selecting konbini as payment method at the checkout, the consumer receives a unique transaction code with an expiration date. Depending on the brand (i.e. 7–11 is slightly different from Family Mart), consumers will have to go to any convenience store and finalise the purchase, which can be either at the cashier or at the kiosk. Multiple providers offer konbini as checkout option for foreign companies selling online in Japan, such as Adyen, Degica and Ingenico ePayments.

In 1974, Japan had 1,000 convenience stores. In 1996, Japan had 47,000 convenience stores and the number was increasing by 1,500 annually. Peter Landers of the &quot;Associated Press&quot; said that the computerised distribution system allows Japanese convenience stores to stock a wider variety of products, allowing them to be more competitive in the marketplace. Because of this technology and the consequent ease of maintaining the right amount of stock, Japan can support one convenience store for every 2,000 people, while in the United States it is one per 8,000 people. Another contributing factor to the widespread proliferation of convenience stores is that, because Japan has a lower crime rate, store owners are not reluctant to keep stores open at late hours in the night and customers are not reluctant to shop during those times.

=== Kazakhstan ===
In Kazakhstan, convenience stores are often referred to as (&quot;dukendеr&quot;), which translates to &quot;stores&quot; or &quot;shops&quot; in Kazakh. Specifically, convenience stores offering a wide range of groceries and everyday items can be (&quot;qosymsha dukender&quot;), meaning &quot;daily goods store&quot;.

Major convenience store chains like Magnum, Small, Atak, Dostyk, Alser, Ramek, Svetofor, and Maxi dominate the retail landscape, offering a wide variety of products such as groceries, beverages, snacks, and housold essentials. Magnum is one of the largest, known for its affordability and wide selection, with stores across Almaty and Astana. Small provides a quick shopping experience with a focus on fresh food, while Atak is recognized for its budget-friendly prices and broad range of everyday items. Dostyk stands out for its emphasis on quality and local products, attracting loyal customers. Alser offers a convenient shopping experience with competitive pricing, and Ramek has grown in popularity due to its focus on fresh goods. Svetofor and Maxi cater to customers looking for discounted prices and a variety of options, with Svetofor offering large store formats for more extensive product selections.

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, 7-Eleven is the market leader in convenience shops, with over 2,000 shops. Other convenience shops in the country are myNEWS.com, 99 Speedmart, KK Super Mart, Quick and Easy and MyMart (owned by Mydin). FamilyMart is also found in Malaysia and as of July 2020, has opened its 200th store in Malaysia with the goal of opening 1,000 stores by 2025, bringing the &#x27;konbini&#x27; concept to Malaysia.

Convenience stores are very popular among Malaysians, especially urban dwellers in Kuala Lumpur or other populated towns like Penang where the population density is higher. Its 24/7 policy allows Malaysians to have easy access to necessities or as an alternative hang-out area, especially since Malaysians love to go out for midnight supper at mamaks and eateries that also open late at night, as more and more Malaysians are beginning to work or go out late. The availability of fresh hot food or cold premade food is popular among young workers with less time to prepare food for themselves, as many have irregular work hours, especially in the city. It also eases the burden of families. Many Malaysians also enjoy the seasonal food that these stores provide. These stores can be found almost anywhere, especially in areas with a higher population density, such as city centres, condominiums, apartment complexes, office areas, residential areas, shop lots and petrol stations, although the store density is as high as Taiwan or Japan.

Items sold at such convenience shops usually range from pre-made local food like nasi lemak, onigiri, buns, snacks, toiletries, drinks, a limited amount of alcohol, newspapers, magazines, slushies, cup noodles, ice cream, hot food, oden, game reload and mobile top up cards. Some also have the service of reloading Touch N&#x27; Go cards or ATMs. Most have a microwave oven and hot water boiler to heat food. Some have seasonal and limited food, desserts or special imported products and items, like FamilyMart importing strawberry Coca-Cola from Japan.

Malaysia has sundry shops that sell daily items and perishables at lower prices, but unlike convenience shops, they are not open 24/7. Some of these sundry shops also sell traditional herbs and ingredients.

===Mexico===
Oxxo is the largest chain in the country, with more than 15,000 stores around the country. Other convenience stores, such as Tiendas Extra, 7-Eleven, SuperCity, ampm, and Circle K, are also found in Mexico. The first convenience store in the country, Super 7 (now a 7-Eleven), was opened in 1976 in Monterrey, Nuevo León. There are also some regional chains, like Amigo Express and CB Mas, that operate in Comarca Lagunera, Super Q and El Matador in Queretaro, Coyote in central Mexico, Kiosko in Colima and some locations in nearby states, and JV in northeastern Mexico. Stores sell fast food like coffee, hot dogs, nachos and prepaid cellphones between MXN$20 and MXN$500, mainly Telcel and Movistar, newspapers, magazines, and Panini products and other novelties.

&quot;Misceláneas&quot; (literally meaning &quot;place where miscellaneous items are sold&quot; and otherwise called &quot;tiendas de abarrotes&quot; (grocery store) in some parts of the country) are smaller, family-run convenience stores often found in central and southern Mexico. They operate in many locations, from rural communities to suburban residential neighborhoods, usually located in front of or below the family&#x27;s residence. They often fulfill the role of neighborhood meeting points and places to disseminate community news. While offering a more limited, and sometimes varied, assortment of items than corporate chains, they fill a void in areas where corporations do not operate. Usually they sell homemade snacks such as tortas and sandwiches, made by the owners. They also provide items in smaller quantities than would be offered for sale in larger stores and markets; for example, selling single cigarettes along with full packs.

=== Mongolia ===
In Mongolia, convenience shops (CU 426SHOPS, GS25 289SHOPS, Circle K etc.) are already common and continue to gain popularity, making the market increasingly saturated with retailers. Currently, CU is the market leader, with the largest number of stores and the highest reputation among customers.

=== New Zealand ===

In New Zealand, convenience shops are commonly referred to as dairies and superettes. Dairies in New Zealand are generally independently owned and operated. The use of the term &quot;dairy&quot; to describe convenience shops was common in New Zealand by the late 1930s. Dairies carved out a niche in food retail by keeping longer trading hours than groceries and supermarkets – dairies were exempt from labour laws restricting trading hours and Saturday trading. With the deregulation of trading hours and in the wake of legislation in 1989 prohibiting sales of alcohol by dairies, the distinction between dairies, superettes and groceries has blurred.

===Peru===
Convenience stores in Peru are typically independent corner stores called &quot;bodegas&quot; that include groceries, alcohol, services and phone booths. Other convenience stores are found at gas stations in urban and connecting areas on highways; examples include Listo! (owned by Primax) and Repshop (Repsol). Recently, , owned by Corporación Lindley S.A., has quickly become the biggest convenience store in the country with 300 stores opened in just two years. Mexican-owned Oxxo has plans to expand to Peru.

===Poland===
Żabka is one of the largest convenience stores in Poland. In 2022 Jarosław Kaczyński, leader of the Law and Justice party, said that the Polish ruling government might buy Żabka convenience store from CVC Capital Partners.

===Philippines===
There is a local version of convenience store in the Philippines, called the sari-sari store, that is located on almost every street, corner, residential area, and other public places around the country.

Aside from local convenience stores, other popular international convenience stores are present on almost every street, especially in urban areas. 7-Eleven is the largest convenience store chain in the country. It is run by the Philippine Seven Corporation (PSC). Its first store, located in Quezon City, opened in 1984, and has now approximately 2,285 branches.

There are also many branches of Uncle John&#x27;s, operated by Robinsons Convenience Stores, Inc.; FamilyMart, operated and franchised by Udenna Corporation; and All Day Convenience Store, owned by Filipino entrepreneur and former Philippine Senator, Manny Villar. Lawson, Circle-K and Alfamart have also opened stores in the country.

=== Russia ===

Major brands of convenience stores in Russia are &quot;Pyatyorochka&quot; (&quot;little 5&quot;) with over 10000 shops functioning, &quot;Monetka&quot; (&quot;little coin&quot;), &quot;Magnit u doma&quot;, &quot;Krasnoe i Beloe&quot; and &quot;Diksi&quot;. However, Russians may occasionally use the word &quot;supermarket&quot;: various convenience store chains used to position themselves as &quot;supermarkets&quot; throughout 1990&#x27;s, such as now discontinued &quot;Sed&#x27;moy Kontinent&quot; (translates as &quot;the 7th Continent&quot;) company.

&quot;Pyatyorochka&quot; line of stores has self-checkout tills, as well as &quot;Perekryostok&quot; line of stores. Both brands belong to X5 Group and even have a mutually compatible &quot;club card&quot;. However, many discounts/sales in both stores require buyers to have &quot;loyalty cards&quot; to unlock the wares&#x27; respective discounts.

===Singapore===

Major convenience shops in Singapore are 7-Eleven owned by Dairy Farm International Holdings and Cheers owned by NTUC Fairprice. Figures from the Singapore Department of Statistics showed that there are 338 7-Eleven shops and 91 Cheers outlets in 2004. Other convenience shops such as Myshop and One Plus appeared in 1983. Myshop belongs to a Japanese company, and One Plus belongs to Emporium Holdings.

Various reasons unique to Singapore have been given for the popularity of convenience shops. Convenience shops sell a wide range of imported goods, whereas minimarts and provision shops sell local products with a limited range of non-Asian products. Convenience shops are situated within housing estates, thus reducing consumers&#x27; travel time. Most families in Singapore are dual-income families. Since both spouses work, there is greater need for convenience in shopping for daily necessities. The 24-hour opening policy allows convenience shops to reach out to a larger group of consumers. First, the policy caters to the shopping needs of consumers who work shifts or have irregular working hours. Secondly, the policy caters to the increasing number of Singaporeans who keep late hours. A 2005 economic review by Price Waterhouse Coopers reported that 54% of Singaporeans stayed up past midnight.

====7-Eleven====

7-Eleven began the trend of convenience shops in Singapore when it opened its first shop in 1982 by Jardines, under a franchise agreement with Southland Corporation of the United States. Dairy Farm International Holdings acquired the chain from Jardines in 1989.

The number of 7-Eleven outlets continued to increase in 1984 while other chains were having difficulty expanding. One Plus was unable to expand due to the shortage of good sites. The original owners of the Myshop franchise, which had seven outlets, sold out to one of its suppliers due to a lack of demand.

In 1985, 7-Eleven faced difficulty in finding favourable locations and failed to meet its one-shop-a-month target. The situation improved in 1986 with a new Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB) tendering system, which allowed 7-Eleven to secure shops without having to bid too high a price. 7-Eleven shops are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, including Sundays and public holidays. This 24/7 policy was seen as the reason that gave 7-Eleven its edge over its competitors.

In 1990, there was a rise in the number of shop thefts in 7-Eleven. The shoplifters were usually teenagers who stole small items such as chocolates, cigarettes and beer. In response to the increase in the number of thefts, 7-Eleven stepped up security measures, which successfully lowered the crime rate by 60%.

====Cheers====

Started in 1999, Cheers is owned by local corporation NTUC FairPrice. Cheers has adopted 7-Eleven&#x27;s 24/7 model and taken similar security measures to prevent cases of shoplifting. Convenience shop owners seeking franchising seem to prefer Cheers over 7-Eleven, probably due to its cheaper franchise fee.

===South Africa===
In South Africa&#x27;s black townships &quot;spaza shops&quot; sell small goods, often out of the proprietors&#x27; homes. However these businesses face competition from large chain stores. Spaza shops owned by immigrants have also become a source of tension in townships.

In white, Indian and Coloured areas, the &quot;corner cafe&quot; (called a &quot;tea room&quot; in Durban) is a convenience store. In white areas these were often owned by Southern European migrants. These cafes are being superseded by convenience stores that are part of fuel service stations.

===South Korea===
Convenience stores in the Republic of Korea date to 1982, when Lotte opened a store in Seoul. Stores saw growth after the 1988 Summer Olympics with the first 7-Eleven, and even since the 2010s where department stores and marts have struggled. As of 2016, the market leader is CU (store) with a 33.3% share, GS25 with a 28.6% share, then 7-Eleven.

===Taiwan===

Boasting more than 10,000 convenience stores in an area of 35,980 km2 and a population of 23 million, Taiwan has Asia Pacific&#x27;s and the world&#x27;s second highest density of convenience stores per person after South Korea: one store per 2,065 people. With 4,665 7-Eleven stores, Taiwan also has the world&#x27;s highest density of 7-Elevens per person: one store per 4,930 people. In Taipei, it is not unusual to see two 7-Elevens across the street or several of them within a few hundred meters of each other.

Taiwan&#x27;s second largest convenience store chain is FamilyMart with more than 3,000 locations. Also competing for customers are Hi-Life, a Taiwanese chain, and OK Mart, a local version of Circle K.

Because they are found everywhere, convenience stores in Taiwan provide services on behalf of financial institutions and government agencies, such as collection of city parking fees, utility bills, traffic violation fines, and credit card payments. Eighty percent of urban household shoppers in Taiwan visit a convenience store each week.
===United Kingdom===

The corner shop in the United Kingdom grew from the start of the Industrial Revolution, with large populations moving from the agricultural countryside to newly built model townships and later terraced housing in towns and cities. Corner shops were locally owned small businesses, started by entrepreneurs who often had other careers prior to establishing, such a trading business. Many well-known high street retail brands, such as Marks and Spencer, Sainsbury&#x27;s and latterly Tesco, originated during the Victorian era as simple, family-owned corner shops.

The name corner shop originated because such shops are traditionally located on the corner of an intersection.

The reign of the corner shop and the weekly market started to fade post–World War II, with the combination of the personal motor car and the introduction from the 1950s onwards of the American-originated supermarket format. The market shift in price and convenience led to the establishment of common trading brands operating as virtual franchises to win back the consumer, including: Budgens, Costcutter, Londis, Nisa and SPAR. There was also a consolidation of some shops under some larger corporate-owned brands, including One Stop.

The primary competition to this privately owned &#x27;corner shop&#x27; model came from the network of consumer cooperatives which were created after the success of that created by the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers in 1844. Rather than being owned by individuals, these shops were owned by their customer-members and, owing to their popularity, the number of co-operative shops had reached 1,439 by 1900. Co-operatives came about as a response to the problem of adulterated food which existed at the time, and later they enabled members to buy types of food that they would otherwise be unable to afford. At their peak in the 1950s, consumers&#x27; co-operatives accounted for approximately 20% of the UK grocery market; however with increasing competition this has decreased to around 6% in 2015.

Due to a number of mergers over the years, the grocery co-operative sector in the UK is now predominately composed of the national The Co-operative Group and a few large regional co-operative societies such as the Midcounties Co-operative and Scotmid. Today, the majority of food retailing co-operatives societies brand their convenience shops as Co-op Food, and together they form the second-largest convenience shop chain in the UK and the largest by number of shops, with one in every UK postal code.
From the late-1960s onwards, many such shops started to be owned by expatriate African-born Indians, expelled from their homelands by the newly independent countries&#x27; rulers (see Expulsion of Asians from Uganda). Under the Shops Act 1950, Sunday trading had been illegal for most traders, with exceptions only allowed for small shops selling perishable items (i.e. milk, bread, butter, fresh meat and vegetables), and most shops that were not off licences (i.e. selling alcohol) had to close at 20:00. The Sunday Trading Act 1994 allowed large-format shops over in size to open on Sunday for not more than six hours despite several proposals from the citizens to remove restrictions at different times.

More recently, due to a combination of competition laws and a lack of large-scale development space, many of the larger retail brands have now developed shop formats based around convenience shop and corner shop scale spaces, including Sainsbury&#x27;s Local, Little Waitrose and Tesco Express.

===United States===

In-store convenience store sales grew 2.4%, reaching a record $195.0 billion in 2011. Combined with $486.9 billion in motor fuels sales, total convenience store sales in 2011 were $681.9 billion, or one out of every 22 dollars of the overall $15.04 trillion U.S. gross domestic product. In New York City, &quot;bodega&quot; has come to mean any convenience store or deli.

The first chain convenience store in the United States was opened in Dallas, Texas in 1927 by the Southland Ice Company, which eventually became 7-Eleven, the largest convenience store chain. Stores connected to a service station developed into a trend, celebrated by some progressive architects:

In 1939, a dairy owner named J.J. Lawson started a store at his dairy plant near Akron, Ohio, to sell his milk. The Lawson&#x27;s Milk Company grew to a chain of stores, primarily in Ohio. Circle K, another large company-owned convenience store chain, was founded in 1951.

Since that time, many different convenience store brands have developed, and their stores may either be corporate-owned or franchises. The items offered for sale tend to be similar despite store brand, and almost always include chips, milk, coffee, soft drinks, bread, snacks, ice cream, candy, gum, cigarettes, lip balm, condoms, phone cards, maps, magazines, newspapers, small toys, car supplies, feminine hygiene products, cat food, dog food and toilet paper. Other less common items include sandwiches, pizza, and frozen food. Nearly all convenience stores also have an automated teller machine (ATM), though other banking services are usually not available. State lottery tickets are also available at these stores.

In 1966, the US convenience store industry first recorded $1 billion in sales. By the end of the decade, the industry had recorded $3.5 billion a year in sales. The first 24-hour store opened in Las Vegas in 1963. By the late 1960s, the number of 24-hour convenience stores increased to meet the needs of a younger population and people who were working late night or early morning shifts.

Some convenience stores in the US also sell gasoline. Only 2,500 stores had self-serve at the pump by 1969. It was not until the 1970s that retailers realized selling gasoline could be profitable and competitive. At the same time, two energy shortages in the decade had many service station owners stop selling fuel altogether since they made more money off of vehicle maintenance, while others decided to convert their garages into convenience stores, noting that they met a need and in some cases netted more profits than garages.

In 2011, there were approximately 47,195 gas stations with convenience stores that generated $326 billion in revenue. Of the 150,000 convenience stores in the country, 120,000 of them are located at fuel stations, which sell approximately 80 percent of the fuels purchased in the country.

Policies regarding the sale of adult magazines vary, but generally larger chains (such as 7-Eleven and Casey&#x27;s General Stores) do not sell these items, while smaller independent stores may do so. One notable exception is fast-growing regional chain Sheetz, which until the late 2010s sold some soft-core pornographic material such as &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Penthouse&quot;, and &quot;Playgirl&quot;. Sheetz ended this practice as part of a broader decision to end sales of all print media.

Because the laws regarding the sale of alcoholic beverages vary from state to state in the US, the availability of beer, wine, and liquor varies greatly. For example, while convenience stores in Alaska, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey cannot sell any kind of alcohol at all, stores in Nevada, New Mexico, and California may sell alcoholic beverages of any sort, while stores in Virginia, Idaho, or Oregon can sell beer and wine, but not liquor. Similar to grocery stores, convenience stores in New York can sell beer only, not wine or liquor. Altoona, Pennsylvania–based Sheetz tried to find a loophole in 2007 by classifying part of one of their prototype stores in Altoona as a restaurant, which would permit alcohol sales. State courts in Pennsylvania promptly overruled this. State law requires restaurants to have on-site consumption, but Sheetz did not do this. Sheetz continues to sell alcohol in other states. In recent years, Sheetz has begun to sell both beer (in the form of walk-in &quot;beer caves&quot;) and wine in most of their Pennsylvania stores as well.

====Crime====

American convenience stores are often targets of armed robbery. In some areas of the US it is not unusual for clerks to work behind bulletproof glass windows, even during daylight hours. Some convenience stores may limit access inside at night, requiring customers to approach a walk-up window to make purchases. The main dangers are that almost all convenience stores only have one person working night shift; most of the transactions are in cash; and easily resold merchandise, such as liquor, lottery tickets and cigarettes, are on site.

Most convenience stores have a cash drop slot into a time-delay safe to limit the amount of cash on hand. Many have installed security cameras to help deter robberies and shoplifting. Because of their vulnerability to crime, nearly all convenience stores have a friendly relationship with the local police. To reduce burglaries when the store is closed, some convenience stores have bars on the windows.

==Similar concepts==
Convenience stores to some extent replaced the old-fashioned general store. They are similar to Australian milk bars, but unlike these are often franchises and not &quot;Mum and Dad&quot; small business operations. In Britain, corner shops in towns and village shops in the countryside served similar purposes and were the precursors to the modern European convenience shop (e.g. Spar). In the Canadian province of Quebec, &quot;dépanneurs&quot; (often referred to as &quot;deps&quot; in English) are often family-owned neighbourhood shops that serve similar purposes. Truck stops, also known as &quot;travel centers&quot;, combine a shop offering similar goods with a convenience store with amenities for professional drivers of semi-trailer trucks. This may include fast food restaurants, showers and facilities for buying large quantities of diesel fuel. The equivalent in Europe is the motorway service station.

Neighborhood grocery stores not big enough to be considered a supermarket often compete with convenience shops. For example, in Los Angeles, a local chain operates neighborhood grocery stores that fill a niche between a traditional supermarket and convenience shop. Because they stock fresh fruit and fresh meat and carry upwards of 5,000 items, they have a lot in common with the supermarket. Due to the relatively small store size, customers can get in and out conveniently or have purchases delivered. In Belgium, convenience shops known as night shops are only permitted to open at night.

<text>7-Eleven, Inc. is an American convenience store chain, headquartered in Irving, Texas. The chain was founded in 1927 as the Southland Ice Company, operating an ice house storefront in Dallas. Then-owned by Southland Corporation, the number of convenience stores expanded and were named Tote&#x27;m Stores between 1928 and 1946. Southland Corporation changed the stores&#x27; name to 7-Eleven in 1946, reflecting expanded hours of operation (7 am to 11 pm). Southland Corporation started franchising its stores in 1961; in 1973 Ito-Yokado, a Japanese supermarket chain, signed a franchisee agreement with Southland Corporation to develop 7-Eleven convenience stores in Japan. Operating the Japanese stores under Seven-Eleven Japan, Ito-Yokado acquired a 70% stake in Southland Corporation in 1991; as majority owner, it changed Southland Corporation&#x27;s name to 7-Eleven, Inc. that same year, then expanded to 100% ownership in November 2005, making 7-Eleven, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of Seven-Eleven Japan. Ito-Yokado reorganized its collective businesses as a holding company in 2005, Seven &amp; I Holdings, with 7-Eleven, Inc. wholly held by Seven-Eleven Japan.

7-Eleven operates, franchises and licenses roughly 85,000 stores in 20 countries and territories as of August 2024. Its stores operate under its namesake brand globally, including the United States, where it also operates as Speedway nationally but mostly in the Midwest and East Coast, and as Stripes Convenience Stores within the West South Central United States. Both Speedway and Stripes operate alongside 7-Eleven&#x27;s namesake stores in several American markets. 7-Eleven also operates A-Plus locations with the name licensed from owner and fellow Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex-based Energy Transfer Partners, though most of these stores have since been rebranded as standard 7-Eleven stores.

== Etymologies ==
The company&#x27;s first outlets were in Dallas, named &quot;Tote&#x27;m Stores&quot; because customers &quot;toted&quot; away their purchases. Some stores featured &quot;native&quot; totem poles in front of the store. In 1946, the chain&#x27;s name was changed from &quot;Tote&#x27;m&quot; to &quot;7-11&quot; to reflect the company&#x27;s new, extended hours, 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., seven days per week. In July 1999, the corporate name of the US company was changed from &quot;The Southland Corporation&quot; to &quot;7-Eleven Inc.&quot;

Since 1968, 7-Eleven&#x27;s logos have included a lowercase &quot;n&quot;. The first wife of John P. Thompson Sr., the company&#x27;s president during the 1960s, thought the all-capitals version seemed a little aggressive. She suggested the change &quot;to make the logo look more graceful&quot;.

== History ==
In 1927, Southland Ice Company employee named John Jefferson Green began selling ice, then he started selling eggs, milk, and bread from one of 16 ice house storefronts in Dallas, with permission from one of Southland&#x27;s founding directors, Joe C. Thompson Sr. Although small grocery stores and general merchandisers were available, Thompson theorized that selling products such as bread and milk in convenience stores would reduce the need for customers to travel long distances for basic items. Thompson eventually bought the Southland Ice Company and turned it into the Southland Corporation, which oversaw several locations in the Dallas area.

In 1928, a manager named Jenna Lira brought a totem pole from Alaska and placed it in front of her store. The pole served as a marketing tool for the company, as it attracted a great deal of attention. Soon, executives added totem poles in front of every store and eventually adopted an Alaska Native-inspired theme for their stores. Later on, the stores began operating under the name &quot;Tote&#x27;m Stores&quot;. In the same year, the company began constructing filling stations in some of its Dallas locations as an experiment. Joe Thompson also provided a distinct characteristic to the company&#x27;s stores, training the staff so that people would receive the same quality and service in every store. Southland also started to have a uniform for its ice station service boys.

In 1931, the Great Depression affected the company, sending it toward bankruptcy. Nevertheless, the company continued its operations through re-organization and receivership. A Dallas banker, W. W. Overton Jr., also helped to revive the company&#x27;s finances by selling the company&#x27;s bonds for seven cents on the dollar. This brought the company&#x27;s ownership under the control of a board of directors.

In 1946, in an effort to continue the company&#x27;s post-war recovery, the name of the franchise was changed to 7-Eleven to reflect the stores&#x27; new hours of operation (7 am to 11 pm), which were unprecedented at the time. In 1963, 7-Eleven experimented with a 24-hour schedule in Austin, Texas, after an Austin store stayed open all night to satisfy customer demand. Later on, 24-hour stores were established in Fort Worth and Dallas, Texas, as well as Las Vegas, Nevada. In 1971, Southland acquired convenience stores of the former Pak-A-Sak chain owned by Graham Allen Penniman Sr., of Shreveport, Louisiana.

With the purchase in 1963 of 126 Speedee Mart (all already open 711) franchised convenience stores in California, the company entered the franchise business. The company signed its first area licensing agreement in 1968 with Garb-Ko, Inc. of Saginaw, Michigan, which became the first U.S. domestic area 7-Eleven licensee.

In the late 1980s, Southland Corporation was threatened by a rumored corporate takeover, prompting the Thompson family to take steps to convert the company into a private model by buying out public shareholders in a tender offer. In December 1987, John Philp Thompson Sr., the chairman and CEO of 7-Eleven, completed a $5.2 billion management buyout of the company. The buyout suffered from the effects of the 1987 stock market crash and after failing initially to raise high yield debt financing, the company was required to offer a portion of stock as an inducement to invest in the company&#x27;s bonds.

Various assets, such as the Chief Auto Parts chain, the ice division, and hundreds of store locations, were sold between 1987 and 1990 to relieve debt incurred during the buyout. This downsizing also resulted in numerous metropolitan areas losing 7-Eleven stores to rival convenience store operators. In October 1990, the heavily indebted Southland Corp. filed a pre-packaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy in order to transfer control of 70% of the company to Japanese affiliate Ito-Yokado.

Southland exited bankruptcy in March 1991, after a cash infusion of $430 million from Ito-Yokado and Seven-Eleven Japan. These two Japanese entities now controlled 70% of the company, with the founding Thompson family retaining 5 percent. In 1999, Southland Corp. changed its name to 7-Eleven, Inc., citing the divestment of operations other than 7-Eleven. In 2005, Seven-Eleven Japan made a tender offer and 7-Eleven, Inc. became its wholly owned subsidiary. In 2007, Seven &amp; i Holdings announced that it would be expanding its U.S. operations, with an additional 1,000 7-Eleven stores in the U.S.

For the 2010 rankings, 7-Eleven climbed to the No. 3 spot in &quot;Entrepreneur&quot; magazine&#x27;s 31st Annual Franchise 500, &quot;the first and most comprehensive ranking in the world&quot;. This was the 17th year 7-Eleven was named in the top 10.

In February 2010, 7-Eleven opened a concept store in DeLand, Florida across from Stetson University, designed to meet LEED environmental standards.

In 2020, 7-Eleven announced it would purchase Speedway for $21 billion.

In 2021, 7-Eleven rolled out a $70 million ad campaign, their largest investment in advertising in years, doubling their market spending from the previous year. The commercials, directed by Harmony Korine, are to reflect the &quot;evolution&quot; of the chain&#x27;s store format, drawing attention to, in part, the fact that &quot;this isn&#x27;t just gas station food, there&#x27;s real restaurant quality food at 7-Eleven&quot;, according to CMO Marissa Jarrantt.

On August 19, 2024, it was reported that Alimentation Couche-Tard—owner of competitor Circle K—had made a buyout offer for Seven &amp; i Holdings. Later, on September 6, 2024, Seven &amp; i Holdings rejected this offer as too low and rife with regulatory risk, although a &quot;sweetened offer&quot; may be considered.

== Products and services ==

7-Eleven in the United States sells Slurpee drinks, a partially frozen soft drink introduced in 1965 (Oklahoma&#x27;s stores sold these as &quot;Icy Drink&quot; until 2020), and Big Gulp beverages, introduced in 1976. Other products include: 7-Select private-brand products, coffee, fresh-made daily sandwiches, fresh fruit, salads, bakery items, hot and prepared foods, gasoline, dairy products, carbonated beverages and energy drinks, juices, donuts, financial services, and product delivery services.

7-Eleven is known for its relatively large drink sizes and 24-hour accessibility. 7-Eleven offers beverages in sizes as large as 128 ounces (3785 mL) (Team Gulp). These beverage sizes were all among the largest sold soft drinks when they were introduced. 7-Eleven has often been associated with these large sodas in popular culture. For example, Mayor Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s proposed ban on large sodas in New York City was frequently referred to as the &#x27;Big Gulp ban&#x27; (even though the ban would not apply to 7-Eleven as convenience and grocery stores in New York are regulated by the state).

In 2012, 7-Eleven changed the size of the Double Gulp from 64 ounces to 50 ounces (1478 mL). The older style cups were too wide at the base, and did not fit vehicle beverage holders. This was not a reaction to the aforementioned large soda ban proposal, according to a spokesperson.
In February 2020, they opened a cashier-less location at the 7-Eleven headquarters in Irving, Texas.

==Global operations==
===Asia===
====Cambodia====
On August 30, 2021, 7-Eleven and Thailand&#x27;s CP Group opened the first 7-Eleven store in Phnom Penh&#x27;s Chroy Changvar district. The company hinted at plans to open at least six more stores in Phnom Penh in 2021. According to plans, products from local small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) sold in 7-Eleven in Cambodia will comprise at least 50 percent of the stock.

====China====

7-Eleven opened its first store in China in Shenzhen, Guangdong in 1992 and later expanded to Beijing in 2004, Tianjin and Shanghai in 2009, Chengdu in 2011, Qingdao in 2012, Chongqing in 2013, Hangzhou and Ningbo in 2017, Nanjing in 2018, and Wuhan, Xi&#x27;an, and Fuzhou in 2019. In China&#x27;s 7-Eleven stores where Slurpees are offered, the Chinese name 思乐冰 (sīlèbīng) is used. They also offer a wide array of warm food, including traditional items like steamed buns, and stores in Chengdu offer a full variety of onigiri (饭团). Beverages, alcohol, candy, periodicals, and other convenience items are available as well. The majority of these stores are open for 24 hours a day. As of September 2021, 7-Eleven has 2,582 stores in mainland China.

====Hong Kong====

7-Eleven first opened in Hong Kong in 1981, when it was a British colony. , it operates as a subsidiary of the DFI Retail Group (formerly Dairy Farm International). It is popularly called &quot;cat¹-zai²&quot; (, meaning &quot;little seven&quot;) or &quot;cat¹-sap⁶-jat¹&quot; (, meaning &quot;seven eleven&quot;). As of 2012, 7-Eleven had 964 stores in Hong Kong, of which 563 were operated by franchisees. Hong Kong reportedly has the second-highest density of 7-Eleven stores, after Macao. All 7-Eleven stores in Hong Kong accept the ubiquitous Octopus card as a method of payment. They also accept payments for utility bills and public housing rent.

In November 1980, Southland Corporation and Hong Kong conglomerate Jardine Matheson signed a franchise agreement to bring 7-Eleven to the territory. The first 7-Eleven shop opened in Happy Valley on April 3, 1981. The chain expanded aggressively across Hong Kong throughout the 1980s. The 50th store opened in Kwai Chung on October 6, 1983, while the 200th was inaugurated by Simon Keswick at Tai Po Centre on May 7, 1987. The stores were sold to Dairy Farm, part of the Jardine Matheson, in 1989.

Octopus card readers were introduced in all 7-Eleven stores in July 1999, although at first these could only be used to add value to the card. In September 2004, the number of locations in Hong Kong was substantially boosted when Dairy Farm acquired Daily Stop, a rival convenience store chain, from SCMP Retailing (HK). The chain&#x27;s 84 shops, located mainly in MTR and Kowloon-Canton Railway stations (as well as shopping centers and housing estates), were converted to 7-Eleven stores.

In 2009, a 7-Eleven location in Quarry Bay opened with a hot food counter, called &quot;7 Café&quot;, selling traditional Hong Kong street food and milk tea. This feature was subsequently extended to select other 7-Eleven locations across Hong Kong under the &quot;Daily Café&quot; and &quot;Hot Shot&quot; brands.

====India====
On 7 October 2021, Reliance Retail announced its partnership with 7-Eleven to open its stores in India. The announcement came a day after Future Group, another retail conglomerate, announced the end of its partnership with 7-Eleven, citing the inability to meet the target of opening stores and payment of franchisee fees. The first 7-Eleven in India opened in Mumbai on 9 October 2021 at Blue Fortuna, Military Road, Marol, Andheri East. Initially opened as a 24 hours outlet it was soon curtailed to shut its doors at 12:00am.

====Indonesia====
In 2008, 7-Eleven announced plans to expand its business in Indonesia through a master franchise agreement with Modern Sevel Indonesia. Modern Sevel Indonesia&#x27;s initial plans were to focus on opening stores in Jakarta, targeting densely populated commercial and business areas. There were 190 7-Eleven stores in Indonesia which then reduced to only 166 stores in September 2016.

7-Eleven then closed its doors in Indonesia in 2017, citing low sales.

====Israel====
In October 2021, it was announced across Israeli media that 7-Eleven had signed a contract with Electra Consumer Products to open hundreds of stores in Israel. The first Israeli 7-Eleven location opened in January 2023 at Tel Aviv&#x27;s Dizengoff Center. Under the agreement with 7-Eleven, Electra was to open a further approximately 400 branded stores in Israel, 300 of them through franchisees. Ultimately the effort failed, and the stores were sold in May 2024.

====Japan====
Japan has more 7-Eleven locations than anywhere else in the world, where they often bear the name of its holding company Seven &amp; I Holdings—in fact, Seven &amp; I&#x27;s subsidiary Seven-Eleven Japan, the master franchisee for Japan, is the direct parent company of 7-Eleven, Inc. Of the 85,000+ stores around the globe, 21,215 stores (nearly 30% of global stores) are in Japan, with 2,824 stores in Tokyo alone. On September 1, 2005, Seven &amp; i Holdings Co., Ltd., a new holding company, became the parent company of 7-Eleven, Ito-Yokado, and Denny&#x27;s Japan.

, 7-Eleven has stores in all 47 prefectures of Japan with the opening of 14 new locations in Okinawa Prefecture.

The aesthetics of the store are somewhat different from that of 7-Eleven stores in other countries as the stores offer a wider selection of products and services. 7-Eleven stores in Japan are also popular among tourists from other countries, as the Seven Bank automated teller machines at branches will accept foreign debit and credit cards for withdrawing cash in Japanese yen.

Following the example of other convenience stores in Japan, 7-Eleven has solar panels and LEDs installed in about 1,400 of its stores.

In July 2019, 7-Eleven launched then almost immediately suspended a mobile payment service, 7pay. The service was hacked upon launch, and attackers were able to spend money from affected customers&#x27; accounts.

====Laos====
On August 31, 2020, 7-Eleven and Thailand&#x27;s CP Group announced a 30-year master franchise agreement. The first Laotian 7-Eleven was expected to open in the country&#x27;s capital, Vientiane, in 2022. It officially opened on September 7, 2023, at Souphanouvong Road, Nongpanai Village, Sikhottabong district in Vientiane.

====Macau====
7-Eleven entered the Macau market in 2005 under the ownership of Dairy Farm, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate operating 7-Eleven stores in Hong Kong. With a land area of about in 2024, Macau has 45 stores.

====Malaysia====

Malaysian 7-Eleven stores are owned by 7-Eleven Malaysia Sdn. Bhd., which operates 3,225 stores nationwide. 7-Eleven in Malaysia was incorporated on June 4, 1984, as a joint veture of Jardine Matheson, Innovest and Antah Holdings group. The first 7-Eleven store was opened in October 1984, in Jalan Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur.

Its 2,000th outlet at Jalan Klang Lama opened in July 2016.

====Philippines====

In the Philippines, 7-Eleven was run by the Philippine Seven Corporation (PSC). Its first store, located at the corner of EDSA and Kamias Road in Quezon City, opened on February 29, 1984.

On July 28, 1988, PSC transferred the Philippine area license to operate 7-Eleven stores to its affiliate, Phil-Seven Properties Corporation (“PSPC”), together with some of its store properties. In exchange thereof, PSC received 47% of PSPC stock as payment.

On May 2, 1996, the stockholders of both PSC and PSPC approved the merger of the two companies to advance PSC group&#x27;s expansion. On October 30, 1996, Securities and Exchange Commission approved the merger and PSPC was then absorbed by PSC as the surviving entity. In 2000, President Chain Store Corporation (PCSC) of Taiwan, also a licensee of 7-Eleven, purchased the majority shares of PSC and thus formed a strategic alliance for the convenience store industry within the area.

In February 2009, 7-Eleven has signed a non-exclusive contract with Chevron Philippines to open its stores in selected Caltex gas stations nationwide.

In 2012, they opened their first store outside of Luzon in Cebu City, which soon expanded to the other parts of Cebu as well as its neighboring provinces. It was followed with the branch openings in Bacolod City in 2013, Iloilo City in 2014, Davao City in 2015, and Cagayan de Oro in 2016. The number of stores eventually spread from these major cities to smaller towns and provinces near them.

In February 2020, 7-Eleven and GCash, the mobile wallet of Alipay and Globe, have teamed up for the introduction of a new payment option for physical purchases: scan-to-pay (STP) via a barcode feature in the GCash app. This enables the customers to generate their unique barcodes through the GCash app and allow the cashier to scan their barcodes to complete the transaction.

In 2020, due to the effect of COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, the Philippine Seven Corporation (PSC) slashed the store openings to 200 from the original 400 stores planned to be open due to financial difficulties from the growing pandemic situation. On July 11, 2021, coinciding with the 94th founding anniversary of the convenience store chain, 7-Eleven Philippines opened its 3,000th store in Meycauayan, Bulacan.

On October 15, 2024, as part of 7-Eleven Philippines&#x27; 40th year of operations, they opened their milestone 4,000th store in Newport, Makati City.

====Singapore====

In Singapore, 7-Eleven forms the largest chain of convenience stores island-wide. There are 393 7-Eleven stores in the country as of February 2018. Stores in Singapore are operated by DFI Retail Group (formerly Dairy Farm International Holdings), franchised under a licensing agreement with 7-Eleven Incorporated. The first 7-Eleven store in Singapore was opened along Upper Changi Road in June 1983, and in 1986 the first franchised 7-Eleven store (under the Jardines) was opened. The license was then acquired by Cold Storage Singapore, a subsidiary of the Dairy Farm Group, in 1989.

In 2006, Shell Singapore and 7-Eleven agreed to rebrand all 68 of its Shell Select convenience stores into 7-Eleven. The partnership was terminated in October 2017, and the remaining 52 7-Eleven stores in Shell petrol stations were gradually rebranded back into Shell Select.

====South Korea====
7-Eleven has a major presence in the Republic of Korea convenience store market, where it competes with CU, GS25 (formerly LG25), and independent competitors. There are 11,067 7-Eleven stores in the Republic of Korea; with only Japan and Thailand hosting more stores. The first 7-Eleven store in the Republic of Korea opened in May 1989 in Songpa-gu in Seoul with a franchise license under the Lotte Group. In January 2010, Lotte Group acquired the Buy the Way convenience store chain and rebranded its 1,000 stores under the 7-Eleven brand.

In 2021, 7-Eleven announced that it would be working with a South Korean nonprofit to create jobs and franchising opportunities for North Korean defectors in South Korea.

In January 2022, Lotte acquired the entire stake of Ministop Korea Co. for 313.37 billion won ($263 million). After acquisition, all the Ministop store were gradually converted to 7-Eleven.

====Taiwan====
7-Eleven is the largest convenience store chain In Taiwan, and is owned by President Chain Store Corporation (PCSC). The first fourteen stores opened in 1979, and struggled to make a profit. Southland Corporation partnered with Uni-President to modernise the stores. However, business was still slow, and Uni-President opted to stock Asian foods. In 1986, 7-Eleven made its first profit in Taiwan. The 5,000th store was opened in July 2014. In January 2018, an experimental and unstaffed shop branded the X-Store was opened. 7-Eleven announced plans to operate a combination store in partnership with Domino&#x27;s Pizza in February 2019.
In the early 2000s, 7-Eleven and Dentsu introduced a corporate mascot named Open-Chan (Open 小將), an extraterrestrial dog who wears a rainbow-shaped crown from a fictional planet known as Planet Open to be a &quot;cartoon spokesperson&quot; for the store chain in Taiwan. Open-Chan quickly grew in popularity among Taiwanese children soon after its initial debut. After Open-Chan&#x27;s subsequent rise to prominence in Taiwan, the character was even introduced in Japan. The unique convenience store culture formed by President Chain Store (7-Eleven in Taiwan) has become a part of Taiwanese culture.

7-Eleven Taiwan also operates an MVNO called ibon mobile, which offers prepaid and postpaid SIM cards using the FarEasTone network.

====Thailand====
The first Thai 7-Eleven opened on 1 June 1989 on Patpong Road in Bangkok. The chain consists of both company-owned (45%) and franchised shops (55%). CP All Public Company Limited, a listed subsidiary of the Charoen Pokphand Group Company, is the 7-Eleven owner and franchisor in Thailand; CP received the franchise rights for Thailand in 1988. As of 2022, CP All has a total of 13,838 stores in Thailand, an increase from 12,432 in 2020. In 2018, 7-Eleven generated 335,532 million baht in income for CP. 7-Eleven holds a 70% market share in the convenience store category, opposed by some 7,000 other convenience stores (e.g., FamilyMart) and 400,000 &quot;mom and pop&quot; shops. Thailand has the second largest number of 7-Eleven stores after Japan.

In an effort to reduce plastic pollution the parent company of 7-Eleven stores in Thailand, CP All Public Company, announced their intent in November 2018 to reduce and eventually end the use of single-use plastic bags. , 7-Eleven—along with 42 other Thai retailers—will stop giving single-use plastic bags to customers. However, the use of plastic bags is still prevalent in many shops throughout the country, as are plastic straws.

====United Arab Emirates====
Seven &amp; I Holdings announced in June 2014 that they had agreed a contract with Seven Emirates Investment LLC to open the first Middle Eastern 7-Eleven in Dubai, United Arab Emirates during the summer of 2015. The company also said that they had plans to open about 100 stores in the country by the end of 2017. The first store was opened in October 2015. The country has 13 stores as of January 2018, but as of the 2020s, 7 Eleven has shut down and is now absent in Dubai until further notice.

====Vietnam====
The first 7-Eleven store in Vietnam opened on June 15, 2017, making Vietnam the 17th country to host the world&#x27;s largest convenience store chain. Seven System Vietnam (SSV) is the Master Franchisee of the 7-Eleven convenience store system in Vietnam, based in Ho Chi Minh City.

===Australia===

The first 7-Eleven in Australia opened on 24 August 1977, in the Melbourne suburb of Oakleigh. The majority of stores are located in metropolitan areas, particularly in central business district areas. Stores in suburban areas often operate as petrol stations and most are owned and operated as franchises, with a central administration. 7-Eleven bought Mobil&#x27;s remaining Australian petrol stations in 2010, converting them to 7-Eleven convenience storepetrol stations. In South Australia all Mobil petrol stations were later sold to Peregrine Corporation and branded as OTR convenience storepetrol stations.

In April 2014, 7-Eleven announced plans to start operating stores in Western Australia, with 11 stores planned to operate within the first year and a total of 75 stores established within five years. The first store was opened on October 30, 2014, in the city of Fremantle. The country has 675 stores as of January 2018.

In April 2022, 7-Eleven Australia settled a class-action lawsuit from its franchisees for A$98 million, amid claims that it had misled franchisees about the profitability of its business model.

In December 2023, Seven &amp; i Holdings of Japan agreed to purchase the Australian 7-Eleven franchise from its original franchise owners for A$1.71 billion. The purchase was finalised in April 2024.

====Class actions====
In August 2015, Fairfax Media and the ABC&#x27;s &quot;Four Corners&quot; programme reported on the employment practices of certain 7-Eleven franchisees in Australia. The investigation found that many 7-Eleven employees were being underpaid at rates of around A$10 to A$14 per hour before tax, well under the legally required minimum award rate of A$24.69 per hour. The &quot;Four Corners&quot; investigation into 7-Eleven won a Walkley Award in 2015.

Franchisees underpaying their staff would typically maintain rosters and pay records that appeared to show the employee being paid the legally required rate; however, these records only included half of the hours the employee actually worked in a week. Employees were then paid on the basis of these records, resulting in them effectively being paid half the legally required rate. It was also reported that workers were often not paid loadings and penalty rates that they are legally entitled to, for working overtime hours, nights, weekends, and public holidays.

After these reports came to light and received widespread attention, some employees had alleged to Fairfax Media that they had begun to be paid correctly through the 7-Eleven payroll system; however, they were then asked by the franchisee to pay back half their wages in cash. 7-Eleven subsequently announced they would fund an inquiry to investigate instances of wage fraud. The inquiry was conducted by an independent panel chaired by former Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission chairman Allan Fels, and with the support of professional services firm Deloitte.

In September 2015, chairman Russ Withers and chief executive Warren Wilmot announced they were resigning from the company. Deputy chairman Michael Smith replaced Withers, while Bob Baily was appointed as interim chief executive.

In December 2015, Stewart Levitt of law firm Levitt Robinson Solicitors, who featured prominently in the &quot;Four Corners&quot; program, announced a potential class action lawsuit against 7-Eleven head office on behalf of franchisees who had allegedly been lured into signing on with 7-Eleven by false representations. This announcement was made on the same day as a Court finding describing Levvit Robinson&#x27;s &quot;hellish bullying&quot; of Dr Brendan French, miring the action in controversy. Also on that day, 7-Eleven offered to pay &quot;the first $25 million of back-pay claims brought by current and former workers. Franchisees would then pay the next $5 million and any payments after that would be split 50-50 between head office and franchisees.&quot; Fels &quot;described the $25 million offer from head office as a &#x27;significant step forward&#x27;&quot; but added that his panel&#x27;s investigation would not be effected. 7-Eleven ultimately paid more than $173 million for &quot;systematic wage theft&quot; to workers employed between 2015 and 2020.

Levvit Robinson was forced to retract misleading statements made in advertising to 7-Eleven franchisees in June 2018 by the Federal Court of Australia. This occurred only months after Levvit Robinson launched a new class action against 7-Eleven that included the ANZ Bank despite banks having stopped loans to 7-Eleven franchisees in 2015. In a settlement approved by the Federal Court in 2022, 7-Eleven agreed to pay $98 million to franchisees alleging that they were misled regarding store profitability. Though the settlement was reached without any admission of fault, the case included allegations that 7-Eleven had misrepresented employee-related costs as about seven percent of total costs, when a more accurate figure was around thirteen percent. This difference made many franchisees &quot;unable to make a profit unless they underpaid staff,&quot; as was shown in the wage theft class action.

===Europe===
====Denmark====

The first 7-Eleven store in Denmark was opened at Østerbro in Copenhagen on September 14, 1993. There are 185 stores, mostly in Copenhagen, Aarhus, Aalborg, and Odense, including two stores at Copenhagen Central Station. In Denmark, 7-Eleven has an agreement with Shell, with a nationwide network of Shell/7-Eleven service stations, and an agreement with the Danish railway company DSB to have 7-Eleven stores at most S-train stations and other train stations.

In 2022, 7-Eleven in Denmark suffered a widespread ransomware attack that caused all stores to temporarily close. 7-Eleven did not comply with the attacker&#x27;s demands. No customer data was compromised in the attack.

====Norway====

7-Eleven has been established in Norway since 13 September 1986, when the first store opened in Oslo. In 2004, Reitan Convenience, a branch of the Norwegian Reitan Group bought the rights to use the 7-Eleven brand in Norway, Sweden and Denmark and since then has massively grown the number of operating shops in Scandinavia.

====Sweden====
7-Eleven entered Sweden in March 1984 with their first branch in Stockholm. Reitan acquired the brands right after 1997, and now has almost 200 stores throughout Sweden.

In May 2024, Reitan announced its intention to stop selling cigarettes in its Swedish stores, including all 7-Eleven Swedish stores, by 2026.

====Turkey====
7-Eleven entered the Turkish market in 1989. Major stakeholder of the master franchise, Özer Çiller sold his shares in 1993, after his wife Tansu Çiller became the Prime Minister. In the 2010s, 7-Eleven left the Turkish market, transferring most of its stores to franchise owners.

====United Kingdom====
During the 1980s, 7-Eleven convenience stores were based in London and the South East of England. The first shop opened in Sydenham, South East London in 1985. The United Kingdom had 57 7-Eleven stores when it was sold to Budgens in October 1997. The company announced in 2014 they had planned to return to the UK market, but this did not progress beyond its announcement. In 2019, the company announced again it had planned to return, but as of October 2022 no stores had been opened.

===North America===
====Canada====

The first 7-Eleven store to open in Canada was in Calgary, Alberta, on June 29, 1969. There are 562 7-Eleven stores in Canada . Winnipeg, Manitoba, has the world&#x27;s largest number of Slurpee consumers, with an estimated 1,500,000 Slurpees sold since the first 7-Eleven opened on March 21, 1970. All 7-Eleven locations in Canada are corporate operated. Like its U.S. counterparts every July 11 the stores offer free Slurpees on &quot;7-Eleven Day&quot;.

A limited number of 7-Eleven locations feature gas stations from Shell Canada, Petro-Canada, or Esso. In November 2005, 7-Eleven started offering the Speak Out Wireless cellphone service in Canada. 7-Eleven locations also featured CIBC ATMsin June 2012, these machines were replaced with ATMs operated by Scotiabank. 7-Eleven abandoned the Ottawa, Ontario, market in December 2009 after selling its six outlets to Quickie Convenience Stores, a regional chain. Following concerns over the fate of 7-Eleven Speak Out Wireless customers, Quickie offered the option for SpeakOut customers to port into the Good2Go mobile provider. SpeakOut subsequently offered online sales as an option, and continues to offer Ottawa-based phone numbers to new and existing customers. 7-Eleven is similarly absent from the Quebec market due to its saturation by chains like Alimentation Couche-Tard and by independent dépanneurs.

In March 2016, 7-Eleven acquired 148 Imperial Oil-owned Esso gas stations in Alberta and British Columbia for C$2.8 billion. Most of their convenience stores were converted to 7-Eleven stores, and they remain supplied by Esso. Some locations were not converted to 7-Eleven; these locations operate under the transitional banner &quot;smartstop 24/7&quot; with their existing store formats, typically inherited from On the Run.

====Mexico====

In Mexico, the first 7-Eleven store opened in 1976 in Monterrey in association with Grupo Chapa (now Iconn) and 7-Eleven, Inc. under the name Super 7. In 1995, Super 7 was renamed to 7-Eleven, which now has 1,835 stores in several areas of the country, making it the second-largest convenience store chain in the country, between Oxxo and Circle K. When stores are located within classically designed buildings (such as in Centro Histórico buildings) or important landmarks, the storefront logo is displayed in monochrome with gold or silver lettering.

====United States====
Supermarket News ranked 7-Eleven&#x27;s North American operations No. 11 in the 2007 &quot;Top 75 North American Food Retailers&quot;, based on the 2006 fiscal year estimated sales of US$15.0 billion. Based on the 2005 revenue, 7-Eleven is the 24th largest retailer in the United States. , 8,144 7-Eleven franchised units exist across the United States. Franchise fees range between US$10,000 – $1,000,000 and the ongoing royalty rate varies. 7-Eleven America has its headquarters in the Cypress Waters development in Irving, Texas. Small-size Slurpees are free on &quot;7-Eleven Day&quot;, on July 11. This holiday first became widely celebrated on July 11, 2008, when first discovered by J. Brabank and C. Johnson. One exception is 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic caused that year&#x27;s cancellation. 7 Rewards members got a free medium Slurpee in their app instead.

7-Eleven Stores of Oklahoma operated independently beginning in 1953 under an agreement with the Brown family. As part of this franchise agreement, 7-Elevens in Oklahoma bore slight differences to stores elsewhere: for instance, products such as Big Bite hot dogs were not sold there, the Slurpee was branded as the &quot;Icy Drink&quot;, and Oklahoma stores operated their own loyalty program called &quot;Thx!&quot;, which did not intersect with the national 7Rewards system. On March 2, 2020, 7-Eleven, Inc. announced it had officially closed on the acquisition of over 100 of these independently operated 7-Eleven stores in Oklahoma. All of these 100 stores were in the greater Oklahoma City metropolitan area. This acquisition increased the total number of 7-Eleven stores in the US and Canada to nearly 9800. Following the purchase, the Oklahoma 7-Elevens were fully integrated into national branding, marketing, and loyalty campaigns.

In April 2021, 7-Eleven launched the &quot;Take it to Eleven&quot; ad campaign. The slogan was partially inspired by the chain&#x27;s name, but also the term &quot;up to eleven&quot; made popular in the film &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot;. The slogan was only for the main 7-Eleven brand and not A-Plus or Stripes.

By summer 2021, the company had installed just a few electric vehicle charging stations, but announced plans to expand considerably, with a target of 250 DC fast-charging locations in the U.S. and Canada by the end of 2022, starting with four states (California, Colorado, Florida and Texas). Less than two years later, in mid-March 2023, 7-Eleven announced plans for 7Charge, &quot;its new, proprietary EV charging network and app&quot;, promoting the Android and iOS mobile apps, which allow users to find 7-Eleven - and future Speedway and Stripes - charger locations and pay for charging. 7Charge locations offer CCS and CHAdeMO charging; Tesla drivers, and other vehicles using the (once-proprietary) NACS connector, can also charge, but require a user-supplied CCS adapter.

In August 2022, 7-Eleven acquired Skipcart, a same-day and on-demand delivery platform.

In early 2024, parent company Seven &amp; i Holdings&#x27; CEO Ryuichi Isaka announced changes to the business model of US stores, placing the company&#x27;s focus on fresh foods instead of a &quot;[reliance] on gasoline and cigarettes&quot;. The company is working with food supplier Warabeya Nichiyo, which already supplies 7-Eleven&#x27;s commissary food offerings in Japan, to create a US supply chain that will bring higher-quality Western and Japanese food offerings to 7-Eleven stores. Isaka also noted 7-Eleven&#x27;s desire to grow its footprint and consolidate a larger portion of the US convenience store market. The company also announced plans to add hot and cold food options and a larger baked goods selection at up to 1,600 Speedway and Stripes stores.

=====Fuel=====
In the U.S., many 7-Eleven locations used to have filling stations with gasoline distributed by Citgo, which in 1983 was purchased by Southland Corporation. 50% of Citgo was sold in 1986 to Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., and the remaining 50% was acquired in 1990. Although Citgo was the predominant partner of 7-Eleven, other oil companies are also co-branded with 7-Eleven, including Fina, Exxon, Mobil, Gulf, Marathon, BP, Phillips 66, Conoco, 76, Shell, Chevron (some former TETCO convenience stores were co-branded with Chevron, and Texaco prior to the 7-Eleven purchase in late 2012), Sunoco, and Amoco. Conoco is the largest 7-Eleven licensee in North America. The Pittsburgh market alone—where 7-Eleven is the market leader by store count but third behind Sheetz and GetGo in revenue—7-Eleven currently offers fuel from Exxon, Gulf, Marathon (both legacy 7-Eleven locations and 
Speedway), BP, and Sunoco (the latter two being from 7-Eleven&#x27;s acquisitions of their company-owned-and-operated locations in the area) and also having previously offered Citgo and Pennzoil at some locations. In more recent years, some 7-Eleven locations sell 7-Eleven branded fuel without a Big Oil brand, much like 7-Eleven&#x27;s primary rival Circle K has done in recent years.

7-Eleven signed an agreement with Exxon-Mobil in December 2010 for the acquisition of 183 sites in Florida. This was followed by the acquisition of 51 ExxonMobil sites in North Texas in August 2011.

Regardless of fuel brand, 7-Eleven has its own fleet network, 7 Fleet, for business customers and truck drivers at locations large enough to feature dedicated fueling lanes for semi trucks, though 7 Fleet can also be used at standard 7-Eleven locations as well. It is mostly designed to compete with Pilot Flying J&#x27;s One9 Network designed for owner-operator drivers, as well as drivers that go to standard Pilot Flying J, Love&#x27;s Travel Stops &amp; Country Stores, and TravelCenters of America locations.

On August 2, 2020, Seven &amp; i Holdings announced to buy Speedway LLC for $21 billion. The deal closed on May 14, 2021. 7-Eleven was ordered by U.S. antitrust regulators to divest 293 stores across 20 states. 124 stores were sold to Anabi Oil, 106 stores were sold to Cross-America Partners LP and 63 stores were sold to Jacksons Food Stores. 7-Eleven also dropped Speedway&#x27;s participation in Pilot Flying J&#x27;s One9 Network in favor of 7 Fleet.

===South America===
====Brazil====
In Brazil, during the 1990s, 7-Eleven had 17 stores in the city of São Paulo in a joint venture between Esteve S.A. Exportadora and Southland Corporation, but all closed due to high competition. In 2018, the company entered into partnership talks to operate convenience stores at gas stations operated by Petrobras Distribuidora in the country, but these did not progress further.

<text>In the area of abstract algebra known as group theory, the monster group M (also known as the Fischer–Griess monster, or the friendly giant) is the largest sporadic simple group, having order

: = 2463205976112133171923293141475971
: ≈ 8.

The finite simple groups have been completely classified. Every such group belongs to one of 18 countably infinite families or is one of 26 sporadic groups that do not follow such a systematic pattern. The monster group contains 20 sporadic groups (including itself) as subquotients. Robert Griess, who proved the existence of the monster in 1982, has called those 20 groups the &quot;happy family&quot;, and the remaining six exceptions &quot;pariahs&quot;.

It is difficult to give a good constructive definition of the monster because of its complexity. Martin Gardner wrote a popular account of the monster group in his June 1980 Mathematical Games column in &quot;Scientific American&quot;.

==History==
The monster was predicted by Bernd Fischer (unpublished, about 1973) and Robert Griess as a simple group containing a double cover of Fischer&#x27;s baby monster group as a centralizer of an involution. Within a few months, the order of M was found by Griess using the Thompson order formula, and Fischer, Conway, Norton and Thompson discovered other groups as subquotients, including many of the known sporadic groups, and two new ones: the Thompson group and the Harada–Norton group. The character table of the monster, a 194-by-194 array, was calculated in 1979 by Fischer and Donald Livingstone using computer programs written by Michael Thorne. It was not clear in the 1970s whether the monster actually existed. Griess constructed M as the automorphism group of the Griess algebra, a 196,883-dimensional commutative nonassociative algebra over the real numbers; he first announced his construction in Ann Arbor on January 14, 1980. In his 1982 paper, he referred to the monster as the Friendly Giant, but this name has not been generally adopted. John Conway and Jacques Tits subsequently simplified this construction.

Griess&#x27;s construction showed that the monster exists. Thompson showed that its uniqueness (as a simple group satisfying certain conditions coming from the classification of finite simple groups) would follow from the existence of a 196,883-dimensional faithful representation. A proof of the existence of such a representation was announced by Norton, though he never published the details. Griess, Meierfrankenfeld, and Segev gave the first complete published proof of the uniqueness of the monster (more precisely, they showed that a group with the same centralizers of involutions as the monster is isomorphic to the monster).

The monster was a culmination of the development of sporadic simple groups and can be built from any two of three subquotients: the Fischer group Fi24, the baby monster, and the Conway group Co1.

The Schur multiplier and the outer automorphism group of the monster are both trivial.

==Representations==
The minimal degree of a faithful complex representation is 47 × 59 × 71 = 196,883, hence is the product of the three largest prime divisors of the order of M.
The smallest faithful linear representation over any field has dimension 196,882 over the field with two elements, only one less than the dimension of the smallest faithful complex representation.

The smallest faithful permutation representation of the monster is on

:   97,239,461,142,009,186,000
: = 243753741113229415971 ≈ 1020

points.

The monster can be realized as a Galois group over the rational numbers, and as a Hurwitz group.

The monster is unusual among simple groups in that there is no known easy way to represent its elements. This is not due so much to its size as to the absence of &quot;small&quot; representations. For example, the simple groups A100 and SL20(2) are far larger but easy to calculate with as they have &quot;small&quot; permutation or linear representations. Alternating groups, such as A100, have permutation representations that are &quot;small&quot; compared to the size of the group, and all finite simple groups of Lie type, such as SL20(2), have linear representations that are &quot;small&quot; compared to the size of the group. All sporadic groups other than the monster also have linear representations small enough that they are easy to work with on a computer (the next hardest case after the monster is the baby monster, with a representation of dimension 4370).

=== Computer construction ===
Martin Seysen (2022) has implemented a fast Python package named mmgroup, which claims to be the first implementation of the monster group where arbitrary operations can effectively be performed. The documentation states that multiplication of group elements takes less than 40 milliseconds on a typical modern PC, which is five orders of magnitude faster than estimated by Robert A. Wilson in 2013. The mmgroup software package has been used to find two new maximal subgroups of the monster group.

Previously, Robert A. Wilson had found explicitly (with the aid of a computer) two invertible 196,882 by 196,882 matrices (with elements in the field of order 2) which together generate the monster group by matrix multiplication; this is one dimension lower than the 196,883-dimensional representation in characteristic 0. Performing calculations with these matrices was possible but is too expensive in terms of time and storage space to be useful, as each such matrix occupies over four and a half gigabytes.

Wilson asserts that the best description of the monster is to say, &quot;It is the automorphism group of the monster vertex algebra&quot;. This is not much help however, because nobody has found a &quot;really simple and natural construction of the monster vertex algebra&quot;.

Wilson with collaborators found a method of performing calculations with the monster that was considerably faster, although now superseded by Seysen&#x27;s abovementioned work. Let &quot;V&quot; be a 196,882 dimensional vector space over the field with 2 elements. A large subgroup &quot;H&quot; (preferably a maximal subgroup) of the Monster is selected in which it is easy to perform calculations. The subgroup &quot;H&quot; chosen is 31+12.2.Suz.2, where Suz is the Suzuki group. Elements of the monster are stored as words in the elements of &quot;H&quot; and an extra generator &quot;T&quot;. It is reasonably quick to calculate the action of one of these words on a vector in &quot;V&quot;. Using this action, it is possible to perform calculations (such as the order of an element of the monster). Wilson has exhibited vectors &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; whose joint stabilizer is the trivial group. Thus (for example) one can calculate the order of an element &quot;g&quot; of the monster by finding the smallest &quot;i&quot; &gt; 0 such that &quot;g&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;u&quot; = &quot;u&quot; and &quot;g&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;v&quot; = &quot;v&quot;. This and similar constructions (in different characteristics) were used to find some of the non-local maximal subgroups of the monster group.

== Subquotients ==
The monster contains 20 of the 26 sporadic groups as subquotients. This diagram, based on one in the book &quot;Symmetry and the Monster&quot; by Mark Ronan, shows how they fit together. The lines signify inclusion, as a subquotient, of the lower group by the upper one. The circled symbols denote groups not involved in larger sporadic groups. For the sake of clarity redundant inclusions are not shown.

== Maximal subgroups ==

The monster has 46 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups. Non-abelian simple groups of some 60 isomorphism types are found as subgroups or as quotients of subgroups. The largest alternating group represented is A12.

The 46 classes of maximal subgroups of the monster are given by the following table. Previous unpublished work of Wilson et. al had purported to rule out any almost simple subgroups with non-abelian simple socles of the form U3(4), L2(8), and L2(16). However, the latter was contradicted by Dietrich et al., who found a new maximal subgroup of the form U3(4). The same authors had previously found a new maximal subgroup of the form L2(13) and confirmed that there are no maximal subgroups with socle L2(8) or L2(16), thus completing the classification in the literature.

Note that tables of maximal subgroups have often been found to contain subtle errors, and in particular at least two of the subgroups in this table were incorrectly omitted from some previous lists.

== McKay&#x27;s E8 observation ==
There are also connections between the monster and the extended Dynkin diagrams formula_1 specifically between the nodes of the diagram and certain conjugacy classes in the monster, known as &quot;McKay&#x27;s E8 observation&quot;. This is then extended to a relation between the extended diagrams formula_2 and the groups 3.Fi24, 2.B, and M, where these are (3/2/1-fold central extensions) of the Fischer group, baby monster group, and monster. These are the sporadic groups associated with centralizers of elements of type 1A, 2A, and 3A in the monster, and the order of the extension corresponds to the symmetries of the diagram. See ADE classification: trinities for further connections (of McKay correspondence type), including (for the monster) with the rather small simple group PSL(2,11) and with the 120 tritangent planes of a canonic sextic curve of genus 4 known as Bring&#x27;s curve.

== Moonshine ==
The monster group is one of two principal constituents in the monstrous moonshine conjecture by Conway and Norton, which relates discrete and non-discrete mathematics and was finally proved by Richard Borcherds in 1992.

In this setting, the monster group is visible as the automorphism group of the monster module, a vertex operator algebra, an infinite dimensional algebra containing the Griess algebra, and acts on the monster Lie algebra, a generalized Kac–Moody algebra.

Many mathematicians, including Conway, have seen the monster as a beautiful and still mysterious object. Conway said of the monster group: &quot;There&#x27;s never been any kind of explanation of why it&#x27;s there, and it&#x27;s obviously not there just by coincidence. It&#x27;s got too many intriguing properties for it all to be just an accident.&quot; Simon P. Norton, an expert on the properties of the monster group, is quoted as saying, &quot;I can explain what Monstrous Moonshine is in one sentence, it is the voice of God.&quot;

<doc id="47425" wikidata="Q193847" url="?curid=47425" title="Bungee jumping">
<text>Bungee jumping (), also spelled bungy jumping, is an activity that involves a person jumping from a great height while connected to a large elastic cord. The launching pad is usually erected on a tall structure such as a building or crane, a bridge across a deep ravine, or on a natural geographic feature such as a cliff. It is also possible to jump from a type of aircraft that has the ability to hover above the ground, such as a hot-air-balloon or helicopter. The thrill comes from the free-falling and the rebound. When the person jumps, the cord stretches and the jumper flies upwards again as the cord recoils, and continues to oscillate up and down until all the kinetic energy is dissipated.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;bungee&quot; originates from West Country dialect of the English language, meaning &quot;anything thick and squat&quot;, as defined by James Jennings in his book &quot;Observations of Some of the Dialects in The West of England&quot; published 1825. In 1928, the word started to be used for a rubber eraser. 

The Oxford English Dictionary records early use of the phrase in 1938 relating to launching of gliders using an elasticated cord, and also as &quot;a long nylon-cased rubber band used for securing luggage&quot;.

==History==

=== Early tethered jumping ===

The land diving (Sa: &quot;&quot;) of Pentecost Island in Vanuatu is an ancient ritual in which young men jump from tall wooden platforms with vines tied to their ankles as a test of their courage and passage into manhood. Unlike in modern bungee-jumping, land-divers intentionally hit the ground, but the vines absorb sufficient force to make the impact non-lethal. The land-diving ritual on Pentecost has been claimed as an inspiration by A. J. Hackett, prompting calls from the islanders&#x27; representatives for compensation for what they view as the unauthorised appropriation of their cultural property.

A tower high with a system to drop a &quot;car&quot; suspended by a cable of &quot;best rubber&quot; was proposed for the Chicago World Fair, 1892–1893. The car, seating two hundred people, would have been shoved from a platform on the tower and then would have bounced to a stop. The designer engineer suggested that for safety the ground below &quot;be covered with eight feet of feather bedding&quot;. The proposal was declined by the Fair&#x27;s organizers.

=== Braked rope sliding ===
In 1963, Jim Tyson, a Sydney, Australia commando, slid down a catenary rope, from a cliff, across a Sydney-area river, braking with carpet, releasing mid-river, and swimming to an accessible river bank.&lt;ref name=&quot;LIFE/1963/Cliff&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern sport ==
The first modern bungee jumps were made on 1 April 1979 from the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, England, by David Kirke&lt;ref name=&quot;thetimes/DK&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Simon Keeling, members of the Oxford University Dangerous Sports Club,&lt;ref name=&quot;ou/DSC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Geoff Tabin, a professional climber who tied the ropes for the jump. The students had come up with the idea after discussing the &quot;vine jumping&quot; ritual of Vanuatu. The jumpers were arrested shortly after, but continued with jumps in the US from the Golden Gate Bridge and the Royal Gorge Bridge. The last jump was sponsored by and televised on the American programme &quot;That&#x27;s Incredible&quot;, spreading the concept worldwide. By 1982, Kirk and Keelling were jumping from mobile cranes and hot air balloons.

Colorado climbers Mike Munger and Charlie Fowler may have bungee-jumped earlier in Eldorado Springs, CO in 1977. Both were cutting-edge alpinists, preparing for a trip to Monte Fitzroy in Patagonia by simulating long falls onto a springy, nylon climbing rope. They scrambled up to a large tree at the top of the wall, above a severely overhanging climb appropriately named &quot;Diving Board&quot;, and tied one end of the rope into the tree. With a piece of flat seat belt webbing around his waist and some homemade leg loops, Mike tied into the other end of the rope and, after no small amount of trepidation, he jumped. He then ascended the rope mechanically to the tree and untied, and then tied in and jumped. The total fall was about .

Organised commercial&lt;ref name=&quot;eoNZ/ajH&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; bungee jumping began with the New Zealander, A. J. Hackett, who made his first jump from Auckland&#x27;s Greenhithe Bridge in 1986. During the following years, Hackett performed a number of jumps from bridges and other structures (including the Eiffel Tower), building public interest in the sport, and opening the world&#x27;s first permanent commercial bungee site, the Kawarau Bridge Bungy at the Kawarau Gorge Suspension Bridge near Queenstown in the South Island of New Zealand. Hackett remains one of the largest commercial operators, with concerns in several countries.

Several million successful jumps have taken place since 1980. This safety record is attributable to bungee operators rigorously conforming to standards and guidelines governing jumps, such as double checking calculations and fittings for every jump. As with any sport, injuries can still occur (see below), and there have been fatalities. A relatively common mistake in fatality cases is to use a cord that is too long. The cord should be substantially shorter than the height of the jumping platform to allow it room to stretch. When the cord becomes taut and then is stretched, the tension in the cord progressively increases, building up its potential energy. Initially the tension is less than the jumper&#x27;s weight and the jumper continues to accelerate downwards. At some point, the tension equals the jumper&#x27;s weight and the acceleration is temporarily zero. With further stretching, the jumper has an increasing upward acceleration and at some point has zero vertical velocity before recoiling upward.

The Bloukrans River Bridge was the first bridge to be used as a bungee jump launch spot in Africa when Face Adrenalin introduced bungee jumping to the African continent in 1990. Bloukrans Bridge Bungy has been operated commercially by Face Adrenalin since 1997, and is the highest commercial bridge bungee in the world.

In 2008, Carl Dionisio of Durban performed a 30 meter bungee jump attached to a cord made of 18,500 condoms.
He currently runs the only Ocean Touch bungee jump in the World at Calheta Beach in Madeira, Portugal, and claims to be the only person operating in the bungee industry single-handed. 
He holds the world record for being the only person to bungee jump while driving a tower crane at the same time, something that he has done hundreds of times since 2017.

== Equipment ==


The elastic rope first used in bungee jumping, and still used by many commercial operators, is factory-produced braided shock cord. This special bungee cord consists of many latex strands enclosed in a tough outer cover. The outer cover may be applied when the latex is pre-stressed, so that the cord&#x27;s resistance to extension is already significant at the cord&#x27;s natural length. This gives a harder, sharper bounce. The braided cover also provides significant durability benefits. Other operators, including A. J. Hackett and most southern-hemisphere operators, use unbraided cords with exposed latex strands. These give a softer, longer bounce and can be home-produced.

Accidents where participants became detached led many commercial operators to use a body harness, if only as a backup for an ankle attachment. Body harnesses generally derive from climbing equipment rather than parachute equipment.

== The highest jump ==
Milad tower bungee jumping with a height of 280 meters is the highest jumping platform in the world

In August 2005, AJ Hackett added a SkyJump to the Macau Tower, making it the world&#x27;s highest jump at . The SkyJump did not qualify as the world&#x27;s highest &quot;bungee&quot; as it is not strictly speaking a bungee jump, but instead what is referred to as a &#x27;Decelerator-Descent&#x27; jump, using a steel cable and decelerator system, rather than an elastic rope. On 17 December 2006, the Macau Tower started operating a proper bungee jump, which became the &quot;Highest Commercial Bungee Jump in the World&quot; according to the Guinness Book of Records. The Macau Tower Bungy has a &quot;Guide cable&quot; system that limits swing (the jump is very close to the structure of the tower itself) but does not have any effect on the speed of descent, so this still qualifies the jump for the World Record.

Kushma Bungee Jump is the world&#x27;s second-highest bungee jump with a height of . It is located in the gorge of Kaligandaki River and world-first natural canyon bungee jump. Another commercial bungee jump currently in operation is just smaller, at . This jump, made without guide ropes, is from the top of the Verzasca Dam near Locarno, Switzerland. It appears in the opening scene of the James Bond film &quot;GoldenEye&quot;. The Bloukrans Bridge Bungy in South Africa and the Verzasca Dam jumps are pure freefall swinging bungee from a single cord.

Guinness only records jumps from fixed objects to guarantee the accuracy of the measurement. John Kockleman however recorded a bungee jump from a hot air balloon in California in 1989. In 1991 Andrew Salisbury jumped from from a helicopter over Cancun for a television program and with Reebok sponsorship. The full stretch was recorded at . He landed safely under parachute.

One commercial jump higher than all others is at the Royal Gorge Bridge in Colorado. The height of the platform is . However, this jump is rarely available, as part of the Royal Gorge Go Fast Games—first in 2005, then again in 2007. Previous to this the record was held in West Virginia, USA, by New Zealander Chris Allum, who bungee jumped from the New River Gorge Bridge on &quot;Bridge Day&quot; 1992 to set a world&#x27;s record for the longest bungee jump from a fixed structure.

== Variations ==

=== Catapult ===

In &quot;Catapult&quot; (Reverse Bungee or Bungee Rocket), the jumper starts on the ground. The jumper is secured and the cord is stretched, then released and shooting the jumper up into the air. This is often achieved using either a crane or a hoist attached to a (semi-)perma structure. This simplifies the action of stretching the cord and later lowering the participant to the ground.

=== Trampoline ===
&quot;Bungee Trampoline&quot; uses elements from bungee and trampolining. The participant begins on a trampoline and is fitted into a body harness, which is attached via bungee cords to two high poles on either side of the trampoline. As they begin to jump, the bungee cords are tightened, allowing a higher jump than could normally be made from a trampoline alone.

=== Running ===
&quot;Bungee Running&quot; involves no jumping as such. It merely consists of, as the name suggests, running along a track (often inflatable) with a bungee cord attached. One often has a velcro-backed marker that marks how far the runner got before the bungee cord pulled back. This activity can often be found at fairs and carnivals and is often most popular with children.

=== Ramp ===
Bungee jumping off a ramp. Two rubber cords – the &quot;bungees&quot; – are tied around the participant&#x27;s waist to a harness. Those bungee cords are linked to steel cables along which they can slide due to stainless pulleys. The participants bicycle, sled or ski before jumping.

=== SCAD diving ===
SCAD diving (Suspended Catch Air Device) is similar to bungee jumping in that the participant is dropped from a height, but in this variation there is no cord; instead the participant free-falls into a net. Untrained SCAD divers use a special free fall harness to ensure the correct falling position. Free-style SCAD divers do not use harnesses. The landing into the huge airtube framed net is extremely soft and forgiving. The SCAD was invented by MONTIC Hamburg, Germany in 1997.

== Risk of injury ==

Bungee jumping injuries may be divided into those that occur after jumping secondary to equipment mishap or tragic accident, and those that occur regardless of safety measures.

In the first instance, injury can happen if the safety harness fails, the cord length is miscalculated, or the cord is not properly connected to the jump platform. In 1986, a man died during rehearsals for a bungee jumping stunt on a BBC television programme, because the cord sprang loose from a carabiner clip.

Injuries that occur despite safety measures generally relate to the abrupt rise in upper body intravascular pressure during bungee cord recoil. Eyesight damage is the most frequently reported complication. Impaired eyesight secondary to retinal haemorrhage may be transient or take several weeks to resolve. In one case, a 26-year-old woman&#x27;s eyesight was still impaired after 7 months. Whiplash injuries may occur as the jumper is jolted on the bungee cord and in at least one case, this has led to quadriplegia secondary to a broken neck. Very serious injury can also occur if the jumper&#x27;s neck or body gets entangled in the cord. More recently, carotid artery dissection leading to a type of stroke after bungee jumping has also been described.
== In popular culture ==
In the film &quot;GoldenEye&quot; and its associated videogame, James Bond makes a jump over the edge of a dam in Russia (in reality the dam is in Switzerland: Verzasca Dam, and the jump was genuine, not an animated special effect). The jump in the dam later makes an appearance as a Roadblock task in the 14th season of the reality competition series &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;.

A fictional proto-bungee jump is a plot point in the Michael Chabon novel &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay&quot;.

In the film &quot;Selena&quot;, in which Jennifer Lopez plays Selena Quintanilla-Perez, her character is shown bungee jumping at a carnival. This actual event took place shortly before Selena&#x27;s murder on 31 March 1995.

In Valiant (comics) #171 (January 8, 1966), the two boys from Worrag island in &quot;The Wild Wonders&quot; in a circus story, jump from high up and seem ready to crash to their deaths, but are stopped by elasticated ropes tied to an ankle of each one.

In the video game &quot;Aero the Acro-Bat&quot;, Aero will perform bungee jumping to obtain items like keys to open gates in a level.

<doc id="47426" wikidata="Q7707" url="?curid=47426" title="Water polo">
<text>Water polo is a competitive team sport played in water between two teams of seven players each. The game consists of four quarters in which the teams attempt to score goals by throwing the ball into the opposing team&#x27;s goal. The team with more goals at the end of the game wins the match. Each team is made up of six field players and one goalkeeper. Excluding the goalkeeper, players participate in both offensive and defensive roles. It is typically played in an all-deep pool where players cannot touch the bottom.

A game consists mainly of the players swimming to move about the pool, treading water (mainly using the eggbeater kick), passing the ball, and shooting at the goal. Teamwork, tactical thinking and awareness are also highly important aspects. Water polo is a highly physical and demanding sport and has frequently been cited as one of the most difficult to play.

Special equipment for water polo includes a water polo ball, a ball of varying colors which floats on the water; numbered and coloured caps; and two goals, which either float in the water or are attached to the sides of the pool.

The game is thought to have originated in Scotland in the mid-19th century; specifically, William Wilson is thought to have developed it in the 1870s as a sort of &quot;water rugby&quot;. The game further developed with the formation of the London Water Polo League and has since expanded, becoming popular in parts of Europe, the United States, Brazil, China, Canada and Australia.

==History==

The history of water polo as a team sport began as a demonstration of strength and swimming skill in mid-19th century England and Scotland, where water sports and racing exhibitions were a feature of county fairs and festivals. Men&#x27;s water polo was among the first team sports introduced at the modern Olympic games in 1900. The present-day game involves teams of seven players (plus up to six substitutes), with a water polo ball similar in size to a soccer ball but constructed of air-tight nylon.

One of the earliest recorded viewings of water polo was conducted at the 4th Open Air Fete of the London Swimming Club, held at the Crystal Palace, London on 15 September 1873. Another antecedent of the modern game of water polo was a game of water &#x27;handball&#x27; played at Bournemouth on 13 July 1876. This was a game between 12 members of the Premier Rowing Club, with goals being marked by four flags placed in the water near to the midpoint of Bournemouth Pier. The game started at 6:00 pm and lasted for 15 minutes (when the ball burst) watched by a large crowd; with plans being made for play on a larger scale the following week.

The rules of water polo were originally developed in the late nineteenth century in Great Britain by William Wilson. Wilson is believed to have been the First Baths Master of the Arlington Baths Club in Glasgow. The first games of &#x27;aquatic football&#x27; were played at the Arlington in the late 19th century (the club was founded in 1870), with a ball constructed of India rubber. This &quot;water rugby&quot; came to be called &quot;water polo&quot; based on the English pronunciation of the Balti word for ball, &quot;pulu&quot;. Early play allowed brute strength, wrestling and holding opposing players underwater to recover the ball. Players held underwater for lengthy periods usually surrendered possession. The goalie stood outside the playing area and defended the goal by jumping in on any opponent attempting to score by placing the ball on the deck.

==Geography==
Water polo is now popular in many countries around the world, notably Europe (particularly in Spain, France, Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, Montenegro, Greece and Romania), Australia, Brazil, Canada and the United States.

Some countries have two principal competitions: a more prestigious league which is typically a double round-robin tournament restricted to the elite clubs, and a cup which is a single-elimination tournament open to both the elite and lesser clubs.

==Rules==
The rules of water polo cover the play, procedures, equipment and officiating of water polo. These rules are similar throughout the world, although slight variations to the rules occur regionally and depending on the governing body. Governing bodies of water polo include World Aquatics, the international governing organization; European Aquatics, which governs international European matches; the NCAA, which governs collegiate matches in the United States; the NFHS, which governs high schools in the US, and the IOC, which governs Olympic events.

==Positions==
There are seven players in the water from each team at one time. There are six players that play out and one goalkeeper. Unlike most common team sports, there is little positional play; field players will often fill several positions throughout the game as situations demand. These positions usually consist of a center forward, a center back, the two wing players and the two drivers. Players who are skilled in all positions of offense or defense are called utility players. Utility players tend to come off of the bench, though this is not absolute. Certain body types are more suited for particular positions, and left-handed players are especially coveted on the right-hand side of the field, allowing teams to launch two-sided attacks.

===Offense===
The offensive positions include: one center forward (also called a &quot;set&quot;, &quot;hole-set&quot;, &quot;center&quot;, &quot;setter&quot;, &quot;hole&quot;, or &quot;2-meter man&quot;, located on or near the 2-meter, roughly in the center of the goal), two wings (located on or near the 2-meter, just outside of the goal posts, respectively), two drivers (also called &quot;flats&quot;, located on or near the 5-meter, roughly at the goal posts, respectively), and one &quot;point&quot; (usually just behind the 5 meter, roughly in the center of the goal, respectively), positioned farthest from the goal. The wings, drivers and point are often called the perimeter players; while the hole-set directs play. There is a typical numbering system for these positions in U.S. NCAA men&#x27;s division one polo. Beginning with the offensive wing to the opposing goalie&#x27;s right side is called one. The flat in a counter clockwise from one is called two. Moving along in the same direction the point player is three, the next flat is four, the final wing is five, and the hole set is called six. Additionally, the position in which a player is can give advantages based on a player&#x27;s handedness, to improve a shooting or passing angle (for example, the right wing is often left handed).

The center sets up in front of the opposing team&#x27;s goalie and scores the most individually (especially during lower level play where flats do not have the required strength to effectively shoot from outside or to penetrate and then pass to teammates like the point guard in basketball, or center midfield player in soccer). The center&#x27;s position nearest to the goal allows explosive shots from close-range.

===Defense===
Defensive positions are often the same, but just switched from offence to defence. For example, the centre forward or hole set, who directs the attack on offence, on defence is known as &quot;hole D&quot; (also known as set guard, hole guard, hole check, pit defence or two-metre defence), and guards the opposing team&#x27;s centre forward (also called the hole). Defence can be played man-to-man or in zones, such as a 2–4 (four defenders along the goal line). It can also be played as a combination of the two in what is known as an &quot;M drop&quot; defence, in which the point defender moves away (&quot;sloughs off&quot;) his man into a zone in order to better defend the centre position. In this defence, the two wing defenders split the area furthest from the goal, allowing them a clearer lane for the counter-attack if their team recovers the ball.

===Goalkeeper===

The goalkeeper has the main role in blocking shots against the goal as well as guiding and informing their defense of imposing threats and gaps in the defense. The goalkeeper usually begins the offensive play by passing the ball across the pool to an attacker. It is not unusual for a goalkeeper to make an assisting pass to a goal on a break away.

The goalkeeper is given several privileges above those of the other players, but only within the five-meter area in front of their own goal:
* The ability to punch the ball with a clenched fist,
* The ability to touch the ball with two hands.

In general, a foul that would cause an ejection of a field player might bring on a five-metre shot on the goalkeeper. Also, if a goalkeeper pushes the ball under water, the action will not be punished with a turnover like with field players, but with a penalty shot.

==Common techniques and practices==
===Offense strategy===
====Player positioning====

The most basic positional set up is known as a &quot;3–3&quot;, so called because there are two lines in front of the opponent&#x27;s goal. Another set up, used more by professional teams, is known as an &quot;arc&quot;, &quot;umbrella&quot;, or &quot;mushroom&quot;; perimeter players form the shape of an arc around the goal, with the hole set as the handle or stalk. Yet another option for offensive set is called a 4–2 or double hole; there are two center forward offensive players in front of the goal. Double hole is most often used in &quot;man up&quot; situations, or when the defense has only one skilled &quot;hole D&quot;, or to draw in a defender and then pass out to a perimeter player for a shot (&quot;kick out&quot;).

Another, albeit less common offense, is the &quot;motion c&quot;, sometimes nicknamed &quot;washing machine offence&quot;, in which two &quot;weak-side&quot; (to the right of the goal for right-handed players) perimeter players set up as a wing and a flat. The remaining four players swim in square pattern in which a player swims from the point to the hole and then out to the strong side wing. The wing moves to the flat and the flat to the point. The weak side wing and flat then control the tempo of play and try to make passes into the player driving towards the centre forward who can then either shoot or pass. This form of offence is used when no dominate hole set is available, or the hole defence is too strong. It is also seen much more often in women&#x27;s water polo where teams may lack a player of sufficient size or strength to set up in the centre forward. The best advantage to this system is it makes man-coverage much more difficult for the defender and allows the offence to control the game tempo better once the players are &quot;set up&quot;. The main drawback is this constant motion can be very tiring as well as somewhat predictable as to where the next pass is going to go.

====Advancing the ball====

When the offence takes possession of the ball, the strategy is to advance the ball down the field of play and to score a goal. Players can move the ball by throwing it to a teammate or swimming with the ball in front of them (dribbling). If an attacker uses their arm to push away a defending player and free up space for a pass or shot, the referee will rule a turnover and the defence will take possession of the ball. If an attacker advances inside the 2-metre line without the ball or before the ball is inside the 2-metre area, they are ruled offside and the ball is turned over to the defence. This is often overlooked if the attacker is well to the side of the pool or when the ball is at the other side of the pool.

====Setting the ball====

The key to the offence is to accurately pass (or &quot;set&quot;) the ball into the centre forward or hole set, positioned directly in front of the goal (&quot;the hole&quot;). Any field player may throw the hole set a &quot;wet pass&quot;. A wet pass is one that hits the water just outside the hole set&#x27;s reach. A dry pass may also be used. This is where the hole set receives the ball directly in his hand and then attempts a shot at the cage. This pass is much more difficult because if the pass is not properly caught, the officials will be likely to call an offensive foul resulting in a change of ball possession. The hole set attempts to take possession of the ball [after a wet pass], to shoot at the goal, or to draw a foul from his defender. A minor foul is called if his defender (called the &quot;hole D&quot;) attempts to impede movement before the hole set has possession. The referee indicates the foul with one short whistle blow and points one hand to the spot of the foul and the other hand in the direction of the attack of the team to whom the free throw has been awarded. The hole set then has a &quot;reasonable amount of time&quot; (typically about three seconds; there is no FINA rule on this issue) to re-commence play by making a free pass to one of the other players. The defensive team cannot hinder the hole set until the free throw has been taken, but the hole set cannot shoot a goal once the foul has been awarded until the ball has been played by at least one other player. If the hole set attempts a goal without the free throw, the goal is not counted and the defence takes possession of the ball, unless the shot is made outside the 5-metre line. As soon as the hole set has a free pass, the other attacking players attempt to swim (or &quot;drive&quot;) away from their defenders towards the goal. The players at the flat position will attempt to set a screen (also known as a pick) for the driver. If a driver gets free from a defender, the player calls for the pass from the hole set and attempts a shot at the goal.

====Man-Up (5 on 6)====

If a defender interferes with a free throw, holds or sinks an attacker who is not in possession or splashes water into the face of an opponent, the defensive player is excluded from the game for twenty seconds, known as a &#x27;kick out&#x27; or an ejection. The attacking team typically positions 4 players on the 2 metre line, and 2 players on 5 metre line (4–2), passing the ball around until an open player attempts a shot. Other formations include a 3–3 (two lines of three attackers each) or arc (attackers make an arc in front of the goal and one offensive player sits in the &#x27;hole&#x27; or &#x27;pit&#x27; in front of the goal). The five defending players try to pressure the attackers, block shots and prevent a goal being scored for the 20 seconds while they are a player down. The other defenders can only block the ball with one hand to help the goalkeeper. The defensive player is allowed to return immediately if the offence scores, or if the defence recovers the ball before the twenty seconds expires.

===Defense strategy===

On defence, the players work to regain possession of the ball and to prevent a goal in their own net. The defence attempts to knock away or steal the ball from the offense or to commit a foul in order to stop an offensive player from taking a goal shot. The defender attempts to stay between the attacker and the goal, a position known as &quot;inside water&quot;.

====Goalkeeper====

Even with good backup from the rest of the defenders, stopping attacks can prove very difficult if the goalkeeper remains in the middle of the goal. The most defensible position is along a semicircular line connecting the goalposts and extending out in the centre. Depending on the ball carrier&#x27;s location, the goalkeeper is positioned along that semicircle roughly a metre out of the goal to reduce the attacker&#x27;s shooting angle. The goalkeeper stops using their hands to tread water once the opponent enters at about the 7-metre mark and starts to lift their upper body using the eggbeater technique to prepare to block the shot. Finally, the goalkeeper tries to block the ball down, which is often hard for the longer reaches, but prevents an offensive rebound and second shot. As is the case with other defensive players, a goalkeeper who aggressively fouls an attacker in position to score can be charged with a penalty shot for the other team. The goalkeeper can also be ejected for twenty seconds if a major foul is committed. Also, inside the five metre mark, the goalie can swing at the ball with a closed fist without being penalised.

====Advantage rule====
If an offensive player, such as the centre forward, has possession of the ball in front of the goal, the defensive player tries to steal the ball or to keep the centre from shooting or passing. If the defender cannot achieve these aims, he may commit a foul intentionally. The hole set then is given a free throw but must pass off the ball to another offensive player, rather than making a direct shot at the goal. Defensive perimeter players may also intentionally cause a minor foul and then move toward the goal, away from their attacker, who must take a free throw. This technique, called sloughing, allows the defense an opportunity to double-team the hole set and possibly steal the inbound pass. The referee may refrain from declaring a foul, if in his judgment this would give the advantage to the offender&#x27;s team. This is known as the &quot;Advantage Rule&quot;.

==Injuries==

Water polo is a contact sport, with little protective gear besides swimsuits and caps with ear protectors, and thus injuries are common. Among the most frequent serious injuries are those affecting the head and shoulders. Those induced to the head are usually caused by elbows or the ball itself, while shoulder injuries are a result of grabbing and pushing while throwing the ball or simply of repetitive overexertion of joints and muscles when taking hard shots. The hands and fingers are vulnerable areas, due to contact when opponents attempt to steal the ball, or when players block shots. Other injuries take place underwater, such as leg and groin injuries, as many actions cannot be seen from above the surface and not much padding is used to protect the players.

Sunburn is a common minor injury in outdoor matches. Players often don&#x27;t apply sunscreen as it makes their skin, and hence the ball, slippery; FINA and most state governing bodies forbid the use of copious sunscreen to make the body harder for the opposing team to grip.

==Variations==
Inner tube water polo is a style of water polo in which players, excluding the goalkeeper, are required to float in inner tubes. By floating in an inner tube players expend less energy than traditional water polo players, not having to tread water. This allows casual players to enjoy water polo without undertaking the intense conditioning required for conventional water polo.

Surf polo, another variation of water polo, is played on surfboards. First played on the beaches of Waikiki in Hawaii in the 1930s and 1940s, it is credited to Louis Kahanamoku, Duke Kahanamoku&#x27;s brother.

Canoe polo or kayak polo is one of the eight disciplines of canoeing pursued in the UK, known simply as &quot;polo&quot; by its aficionados. Polo combines paddling and ball handling skills with a contact team game, where tactics and positional play are as important as the speed and fitness of the individual athletes.

Flippa ball is a precursor variant intended for younger and beginner players to learn the basics of polo. It is played in shallow water and permits touching the bottom of the pool. Players rotate positions after each score.

==Water polo equipment==
Little player equipment is needed to play water polo. Items required in water polo include:
*Ball: A water polo ball is constructed of waterproof material to allow it to float on the water. The cover is textured to give players additional grip. The size of the ball is different for men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and junior games.
*Caps: A water polo cap is used to protect the players&#x27; heads and ears, and to make them identifiable from afar. Home team field players wear numbered dark-colored caps; Visiting team field players wear numbered white caps. Both starting goalkeepers wear red caps (sometimes quartered), numbered &quot;1&quot; (substitute goalies&#x27; caps are numbered either &quot;13&quot; for FINA international play or &quot;15&quot; for NCAA play) Caps are fitted with ear protectors.
*Goals: Two goals are needed in order to play water polo. These can either be put on the side of the pool, or in the pool using floaters.
*Mouthguard: A mouthguard is not mandatory in most tournaments but is recommended.
*Swimwear: Male water polo players wear either swim briefs or jammers (thigh-length trunks). Female players must wear a one-piece swimsuit. Suit-grabbing fouls are common, so players often wear tight-fitting suits, and may layer on several suits at a time for additional security. Many swimwear labels also sell specialized water polo suits that feature reinforced stitching and tougher fabric. Female water polo suits are generally one-piece outfits which do not have open backs, but zip securely up the back so as to not have straps that can be easily grabbed.

==Major competitions==
===Summer Olympics===
Men&#x27;s water polo at the Olympics was the first team sport introduced at the 1900 games, along with cricket, rugby, football, polo (with horses), rowing and tug of war. Women&#x27;s water polo became an Olympic sport at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games after political protests from the Australian women&#x27;s team.

One of the most historically known matches often referred to as the &quot;Blood in the Water match&quot;, was a 1956 Summer Olympics semi-final match between Hungary and the Soviet Union, played in Melbourne. As the athletes left for the games, the Hungarian revolution began, and the Soviet army crushed the uprising. The Hungarians defeated the Soviets 4–0 before the game was called off in the final minute to prevent angry Hungarians in the crowd reacting to Valentin Prokopov punching Ervin Zádor.

===Other tournaments===
Every 2 to 4 years since 1973, a men&#x27;s Water Polo World Championship is organized within the FINA World Aquatics Championships. Women&#x27;s water polo was added in 1986. A second tournament series, the FINA Water Polo World Cup, has been held every other year since 1979. In 2002, FINA organised the sport&#x27;s first international league, the FINA Water Polo World League.

There is also a European Water Polo Championship that is held every other year.

Professional water polo is played in many Southern and Eastern European countries like Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Montenegro, Russia, Serbia, Spain, etc. with the LEN Euroleague tournament played amongst the best teams.

There is also a World Club Water Polo Challenge.

<text>Atlas is an inner satellite of Saturn which was discovered by Richard Terrile in 1980 from Voyager photos and was designated &#x27;. In 1983 it was officially named after Atlas of Greek mythology, because it &quot;holds the rings on its shoulders&quot; like the Titan Atlas held the sky up above the Earth. It is also designated &#x27;.

Atlas is the closest satellite to the sharp outer edge of the A ring, and was long thought to be a shepherd satellite for this ring. However, now it is known that the outer edge of the ring is instead maintained by a 7:6 orbital resonance with the larger but more distant moons Janus and Epimetheus. In 2004 a faint, thin ring, temporarily designated , was discovered in the Atlantean orbit.

High-resolution images taken in June 2005 by &quot;Cassini&quot; revealed Atlas to have a roughly spherical centre surrounded by a large, smooth equatorial ridge. The most likely explanation for this unusual and prominent structure is that ring material swept up by the moon accumulates on the moon, with a strong preference for the equator due to the ring&#x27;s thinness. The size of the equatorial ridge is comparable with the expected Roche lobe of the moon, which means that for any additional particles impacting the equator, the centrifugal force will nearly overcome Atlas&#x27;s tiny gravity, and they will probably be lost.

Atlas is significantly perturbed by Prometheus and to a lesser degree by Pandora, leading to excursions in longitude of up to 600 km (~0.25°) away from the precessing Keplerian orbit with a rough period of about 3 years. Because the orbits of Prometheus and Pandora are chaotic, it is suspected that Atlas&#x27;s may be as well.

<text>In Greek mythology, Atlas (; , &quot;Átlās&quot;) is a Titan condemned to hold up the heavens or sky for eternity after the Titanomachy. Atlas also plays a role in the myths of two of the greatest Greek heroes: Heracles (Hercules in Roman mythology) and Perseus. According to the ancient Greek poet Hesiod, Atlas stood at the ends of the earth in the extreme west. Later, he became commonly identified with the Atlas Mountains in northwest Africa and was said to be the first King of Mauretania (modern-day Morocco and west Algeria, not to be confused with the modern-day country of Mauritania). Atlas was said to have been skilled in philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy. In antiquity, he was credited with inventing the first celestial sphere. In some texts, he is even credited with the invention of astronomy itself.

Atlas was the son of the Titan Iapetus and the Oceanid Asia or Clymene. He was a brother of Epimetheus and Prometheus. He had many children, mostly daughters, the Hesperides, the Hyades, the Pleiades, and the nymph Calypso who lived on the island Ogygia.

The term &quot;atlas&quot; has been used to describe a collection of maps since the 16th century when Flemish geographer Gerardus Mercator published his work in honor of the mythological Titan.

The &quot;Atlantic Ocean&quot; is derived from &quot;Sea of Atlas&quot;. The name of Atlantis mentioned in Plato&#x27;s Timaeus&#x27; dialogue derives from &quot;Atlantis nesos&quot; (), literally meaning &quot;Atlas&#x27;s Island&quot;.

==Etymology==

The etymology of the name &quot;Atlas&quot; is uncertain. Virgil took pleasure in translating etymologies of Greek names by combining them with adjectives that explained them: for Atlas his adjective is &quot;durus&quot;, &quot;hard, enduring&quot;, which suggested to George Doig that Virgil was aware of the Greek τλῆναι &quot;to endure&quot;; Doig offers the further possibility that Virgil was aware of Strabo&#x27;s remark that the native North African name for this mountain was &quot;Douris&quot;. Since the Atlas Mountains rise in the region inhabited by Berbers, it has been suggested that the name might be taken from one of the Berber languages, specifically from the word &quot;ádrār&quot; &quot;mountain&quot;.

Traditionally historical linguists etymologize the Ancient Greek word Ἄτλας (genitive: Ἄτλαντος) as comprised from copulative α- and the Proto-Indo-European root &#x27;to uphold, support&#x27; (whence also τλῆναι), and which was later reshaped to an nt-stem. However, Robert S. P. Beekes argues that it cannot be expected that this ancient Titan carries an Indo-European name, and he suggests instead that the word is of Pre-Greek origin, as such words often end in &quot;-ant&quot;.

==Mythology==
===War and punishment===

Atlas and his brother Menoetius sided with the Titans in their war against the Olympians, the Titanomachy. When the Titans were defeated, many of them (including Menoetius) were confined to Tartarus, but Zeus condemned Atlas to stand at the western edge of the earth and hold up the sky on his shoulders. Thus, he was &quot;Atlas Telamon&quot;, &quot;enduring Atlas&quot;, and became a doublet of Coeus, the embodiment of the celestial axis around which the heavens revolve.

A common misconception today is that Atlas was forced to hold the Earth on his shoulders, but Classical art shows Atlas holding the celestial spheres, not the terrestrial globe; the solidity of the marble globe borne by the Farnese Atlas may have aided the conflation, reinforced in the 16th century by the developing usage of &quot;atlas&quot; to describe a corpus of terrestrial maps. 

===Encounter with Perseus===

The Greek poet Polyidus tells a tale of Atlas, then a shepherd, encountering Perseus who turned him to stone. Ovid later gives a more detailed account of the incident, combining it with the myth of Heracles. In this account Atlas is not a shepherd, but a king. According to Ovid, Perseus arrives in Atlas&#x27;s Kingdom and asks for shelter, declaring he is a son of Zeus. Atlas, fearful of a prophecy that warned of a son of Zeus stealing his golden apples from his orchard, refuses Perseus hospitality. In this account, Atlas is turned not just into stone by Perseus, but an entire mountain range: Atlas&#x27;s head the peak, his shoulders ridges and his hair woods. The prophecy did not relate to Perseus stealing the golden apples but to Heracles, another son of Zeus, and Perseus&#x27;s great-grandson.

===Encounter with Heracles===
One of the Twelve Labours of the hero Heracles was to fetch some of the golden apples that grow in Hera&#x27;s garden, tended by Atlas&#x27;s reputed daughters, the Hesperides (which were also called the Atlantides), and guarded by the dragon Ladon. Heracles went to Atlas and offered to hold up the heavens while Atlas got the apples from his daughters.

Upon his return with the apples, however, Atlas attempted to trick Heracles into carrying the sky permanently by offering to deliver the apples himself, as anyone who purposely took the burden must carry it forever, or until someone else took it away. Heracles, suspecting Atlas did not intend to return, pretended to agree to Atlas&#x27;s offer, asking only that Atlas take the sky again for a few minutes so Heracles could rearrange his cloak as padding on his shoulders. When Atlas set down the apples and took the heavens upon his shoulders again, Heracles took the apples and ran away.

In some versions, Heracles instead built the two great Pillars of Hercules to hold the sky away from the earth, liberating Atlas much as he liberated Prometheus.

==Other mythological characters named Atlas==
Besides the Titan, there are other mythological characters who were also called Atlas:

===King of Atlantis===
According to Plato, the first king of Atlantis was also named Atlas, but that Atlas was a son of Poseidon and the mortal woman Cleito. The works of Eusebius and Diodorus also give an Atlantean account of Atlas. In these accounts, Atlas&#x27; father was Uranus and his mother was Gaia. His grandfather was Elium &quot;King of Phoenicia&quot; who lived in Byblos with his wife Beruth. Atlas was raised by his sister, Basilia.

===King of Mauretania===
Atlas was also a legendary king of Mauretania, the land of the Mauri in antiquity roughly corresponding with modern Morocco. In the 16th century, Gerardus Mercator put together the first collection of maps to be called an &quot;Atlas&quot; and devoted his book to the &quot;King of Mauretania&quot;.

Atlas became associated with Northwest Africa over time. He had been connected with the Hesperides, or &quot;Nymphs&quot;, which guarded the golden apples, and Gorgons both of which were said to live beyond Ocean in the extreme west of the world since Hesiod&#x27;s Theogony. Diodorus and Palaephatus mention that the Gorgons lived in the Gorgades, islands in the Aethiopian Sea. The main island was called Cerna, and modern-day arguments have been advanced that these islands may correspond to Cape Verde due to Phoenician exploration. 

The Northwest Africa region emerged as the canonical home of the King via separate sources. In particular, according to Ovid, after Perseus turns Atlas into a mountain range, he flies over Aethiopia, the blood of Medusa&#x27;s head giving rise to Libyan snakes. By the time of the Roman Empire, the habit of associating Atlas&#x27;s home to a chain of mountains, the Atlas Mountains, which were near Mauretania and Numidia, was firmly entrenched.

===Other===

The identifying name &quot;Aril&quot; is inscribed on two 5th-century BC Etruscan bronze items: a mirror from Vulci and a ring from an unknown site. Both objects depict the encounter with Atlas of Hercle—the Etruscan Heracles—identified by the inscription; they represent rare instances where a figure from Greek mythology was imported into Etruscan mythology, but the name was not. The Etruscan name &quot;Aril&quot; is etymologically independent. 

==Genealogy==
Sources describe Atlas as the father, by different goddesses, of numerous children, mostly daughters. Some of these are assigned conflicting or overlapping identities or parentage in different sources.

* By Hesperis:
** The Hesperides
* By Pleione (or Aethra):
** The Hyades
** A son, Hyas
** The Pleiades
* By one or more unspecified goddesses:
** Calypso
** Dione
** Maera

Hyginus, in his &quot;Fabulae&quot;, adds an older Atlas who is the son of Aether and Gaia.

==Cultural influence==

Atlas&#x27; best-known cultural association is in cartography. The first publisher to associate the Titan Atlas with a group of maps was the print-seller Antonio Lafreri, who included a depiction of the Titan on the engraved titlepage he applied to his &quot;ad hoc&quot; assemblages of maps, &quot;Tavole Moderne di Geografia de la Maggior parte del Mondo di Diversi Autori&quot; (1572). However, Lafreri did not use the word &quot;Atlas&quot; in the title of his work; this was an innovation of Gerardus Mercator, who named his work &quot;Atlas Sive Cosmographicae Meditationes de Fabrica Mundi et Fabricati&quot; (1585–1595), using the word &quot;Atlas&quot; as a dedication specifically to honor the Titan Atlas, in his capacity as King of Mauretania, a learned philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer.

In psychology, Atlas is used metaphorically to describe the personality of someone whose childhood was characterized by excessive responsibilities.

Ayn Rand&#x27;s political dystopian novel &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; (1957) references the popular misconception of Atlas holding up the entire world on his back by comparing the capitalist and intellectual class as being &quot;modern Atlases&quot; who hold the modern world up at great expense to themselves.

<text>An atlas is a collection of maps; it is typically a bundle of maps of Earth or of a continent or region of Earth.

Atlases have traditionally been bound into book form, but today, many atlases are in multimedia formats. In addition to presenting geographical features and political boundaries, many atlases often feature geopolitical, social, religious, and economic statistics. They also have information about the map and places in it.

==Etymology==
The use of the word &quot;atlas&quot; in a geographical context dates from 1595 when the German-Flemish geographer Gerardus Mercator published (&quot;Atlas or cosmographical meditations upon the creation of the universe and the universe as created&quot;). This title provides Mercator&#x27;s definition of the word as a description of the creation and form of the whole universe, not simply as a collection of maps. The volume that was published posthumously one year after his death is a wide-ranging text but, as the editions evolved, it became simply a collection of maps and it is in that sense that the word was used from the middle of the 17th century. The neologism coined by Mercator was a mark of his respect for the Titan Atlas, the &quot;King of Mauretania&quot;, whom he considered to be the first great geographer.

==History==

The first work that contained systematically arranged maps of uniform size representing the first modern atlas was prepared by Italian cartographer Pietro Coppo in the early 16th century; however, it was not published at that time, so it is conventionally not considered the first atlas. Rather, that title is awarded to the collection of maps by the Brabantian cartographer Abraham Ortelius printed in 1570.

Atlases published nowadays are quite different from those published in the 16th–19th centuries. Unlike today, most atlases were not bound and ready for the customer to buy, but their possible components were shelved separately. The client could select the contents to their liking, and have the maps coloured/gilded or not. The atlas was then bound. Thus, early printed atlases with the same title page can be different in contents.

States began producing national atlases in the 19th century.

==Types==
A &quot;travel atlas&quot; is made for easy use during travel, and often has spiral bindings, so it may be folded flat. National atlases in Europe are typically printed at a scale of 1:250,000 to 1:500,000; city atlases are 1:20,000 to 1:25,000, doubling for the central area (for example, Geographers&#x27; A-Z Map Company&#x27;s A–Z atlas of London is 1:22,000 for Greater London and 1:11,000 for Central London). A travel atlas may also be referred to as a &quot;road map&quot;.

A &quot;desk atlas&quot; is made similar to a reference book. It may be in hardback or paperback form.

There are atlases of the other planets (and their satellites) in the Solar System.

Atlases of anatomy exist, mapping out organs of the human body or other organisms.

<text>In anatomy, the atlas (C1) is the most superior (first) cervical vertebra of the spine and is located in the neck. 

The bone is named for Atlas of Greek mythology, just as Atlas bore the weight of the heavens, the first cervical vertebra supports the head. However, the term atlas was first used by the ancient Romans for the seventh cervical vertebra (C7) due to its suitability for supporting burdens. In Greek mythology, Atlas was condemned to bear the weight of the heavens as punishment for rebelling against Zeus. Ancient depictions of Atlas show the globe of the heavens resting at the base of his neck, on C7. Sometime around 1522, anatomists decided to call the first cervical vertebra the atlas. Scholars believe that by switching the designation atlas from the seventh to the first cervical vertebra Renaissance anatomists were commenting that the point of man&#x27;s burden had shifted from his shoulders to his head—that man&#x27;s true burden was not a physical load, but rather, his mind.

The atlas is the topmost vertebra and the axis (the vertebra below it) forms the joint connecting the skull and spine. The atlas and axis are specialized to allow a greater range of motion than normal vertebrae. They are responsible for the nodding and rotation movements of the head.

The atlanto-occipital joint allows the head to nod up and down on the vertebral column. The dens acts as a pivot that allows the atlas and attached head to rotate on the axis, side to side.

The atlas&#x27;s chief peculiarity is that it has no body, which has fused with the next vertebra. It is ring-like and consists of an anterior and a posterior arch and two lateral masses.

The atlas and axis are important neurologically because the brainstem extends down to the axis.

==Structure==
===Anterior arch===
The anterior arch forms about one-fifth of the ring: its anterior surface is convex, and presents at its center the anterior tubercle for the attachment of the &quot;longus colli&quot; muscles and the anterior longitudinal ligament; posteriorly it is concave, and marked by a smooth, oval or circular facet (&quot;fovea dentis&quot;), for articulation with the odontoid process (dens) of the axis.

The upper and lower borders respectively give attachment to the anterior atlantooccipital membrane and the anterior atlantoaxial ligament; the former connects it with the occipital bone above, and the latter with the axis below.

===Posterior arch===
The posterior arch forms about two-fifths of the circumference of the ring: it ends behind in the posterior tubercle, which is the rudiment of a spinous process and gives origin to the &quot;recti capitis posteriores minores&quot; and the ligamentum nuchae. The diminutive size of this process prevents any interference with the movements between the atlas and the skull.

The posterior part of the arch presents above and behind a rounded edge for the attachment of the posterior atlantooccipital membrane, while immediately behind each superior articular process is the superior vertebral notch (&quot;sulcus arteriae vertebralis&quot;). This is a groove that is sometimes converted into a foramen by ossification of the posterior atlantooccipital membrane to create a delicate bony spiculum which arches backward from the posterior end of the superior articular process. This anatomical variant is known as an arcuate foramen.

This groove transmits the vertebral artery, which, after ascending through the foramen in the transverse process, winds around the lateral mass in a direction backward and medially to enter the vertebrobasilar circulation through the foramen magnum; it also transmits the suboccipital nerve (first spinal nerve).

On the under surface of the posterior arch, behind the inferior articular facets, are two shallow grooves, the inferior vertebral notches. The lower border gives attachment to the posterior atlantoaxial ligament, which connects it with the axis.

===Lateral masses===
The lateral masses are the most bulky and solid parts of the atlas, in order to support the weight of the head.

Each carries two articular facets, a superior and an inferior.

* The &quot;superior facets&quot; are of large size, oval, concave, and approach each other in front, but diverge behind: they are directed upward, medially, and a little backward, each forming a cup for the corresponding condyle of the occipital bone, and are admirably adapted to the nodding movements of the head. Not infrequently they are partially subdivided by indentations which encroach upon their margins.
* The &quot;inferior articular facets&quot; are circular in form, flattened or slightly convex and directed downward and medially, articulating with the axis, and permitting the rotatory movements of the head.

===Vertebral foramen===
Just below the medial margin of each superior facet is a small tubercle, for the attachment of the transverse atlantal ligament which stretches across the ring of the atlas and divides the vertebral foramen into two unequal parts:

* the &quot;anterior&quot; or &quot;smaller&quot; receiving the odontoid process of the axis
* the &quot;posterior&quot; transmitting the spinal cord (&quot;medulla spinalis&quot;) and its membranes

This part of the vertebral canal is of considerable size, much greater than is required for the accommodation of the spinal cord.

===Transverse processes===
The transverse processes are large; they project laterally and downward from the lateral masses, and serve for the attachment of muscles which assist in rotating the head. They are long, and their anterior and posterior tubercles are fused into one mass; the foramen transversarium is directed from below, upward and backward.

===Development===

The atlas is usually ossified from three centers.

Of these, one appears in each lateral mass about the seventh week of fetal life, and extends backward; at birth, these portions of bone are separated from one another behind by a narrow interval filled with cartilage.

Between the third and fourth years they unite either directly or through the medium of a separate center developed in the cartilage.

At birth, the anterior arch consists of cartilage; in this a separate center appears about the end of the first year after birth, and joins the lateral masses from the sixth to the eighth year.

The lines of union extend across the anterior portions of the superior articular facets.

Occasionally there is no separate center, the anterior arch being formed by the forward extension and ultimate junction of the two lateral masses; sometimes this arch is ossified from two centers, one on either side of the middle line.

=== Variations ===

Accessory transverse foramen of the atlas is present in 1.4–12.5% across the population.

Foramen arcuale or a bony bridge above the vertebral artery on the posterior arch of the atlas may be present. This foramen has an overall prevalence of 9.1%. Arch defects refer to the condition where a gap or cleft exists at the anterior arch or posterior arch of the atlas. The prevalence of the posterior arch defect and anterior arch defect was 0.95% and 0.087%, respectively. The anterior arch defect may be presented along with posterior arch defect, a condition known as combined arch defect or bipartite atlas.

==Function==

===Muscular attachments===

====Transverse processes====
Upper surface:

* rectus capitis anterior occipital bone (inferior surface of the base)
* rectus capitis lateralis occipital bone (beneath the jugular process)
* obliquus capitis superior occipital bone (between the superior and inferior nuchal lines)

Interior and dorsal part:

* obliquus capitis inferior spinous process of the axis

Lower surface:

* splenius cervicis (part) spinous processes of T02–T05
* levator scapulae (part) superior part of medial border of the scapula
* intertransversarius posterior cervicis transverse process of the axis (posterior tubercle)
* intertransversarius anterior cervicis transverse process of the axis (anterior tubercle)

====Posterior tubercle====
Upper surface:

* rectus capitis posterior minor occipital bone (medial part of the interior nuchal line, and the surface between it and the foramen magnum)

Lower surface:

* interspinalis cervicis spinous process of the axis

====Anterior arch====
* longus colli (superior oblique) transverse processes of C03–C05.

==Clinical significance==

There are 5 types of C1 fractures referred to as the Levine Classification of Atlas Fractures

Type 1: Isolated bony apophysis (transverse process fracture

Type 2: Isolated posterior arch fractures

Type 3: Isolated anterior arch fracture

Type 4: Comminuted fracture of the lateral mass

Type 5: Bilateral burst fracture (AKA Jefferson Fracture)

A break in the first vertebra is referred to as a Jefferson fracture.

Craniocervical junction misalignment is also suspected as a factor in neurodegenerative diseases where altered CSF flow plays a part in the pathological process.

Hyperextension (Whiplash) Injury

A rear-end traffic collision or a poorly performed rugby tackle can both result in the head being whipped back on the shoulders, causing whiplash. In minor cases, the anterior longitudinal ligament of the spine is damaged which is acutely painful for the patient.

In more severe cases, fractures can occur to any of the cervical vertebrae as they are suddenly compressed by rapid deceleration. Again, since the vertebral foramen is large there is less chance of spinal cord involvement.

The worst-case scenario for these injuries is that dislocation or subluxation of the cervical vertebrae occurs. This often happens at the C2 level, where the body of C2 moves anteriorly with respect to C3. Such an injury may well lead to spinal cord involvement, and as a consequence quadriplegia or death may occur. More commonly, subluxation occurs at the C6/C7 level (50% of cases).

<text>The Atlas Mountains are a mountain range in the Maghreb in North Africa. It separates the Sahara Desert from the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean; the name &quot;Atlantic&quot; is derived from the mountain range, which stretches around through Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. The range&#x27;s highest peak is Toubkal, which is in central Morocco, with an elevation of . The Atlas Mountains are primarily inhabited by Berber populations.

The terms for &#x27;mountain&#x27; are &quot;Adrar&quot; and &quot;adras&quot; in some Berber languages, and these terms are believed to be cognates of the toponym &quot;Atlas&quot;. The mountains are home to a number of animals and plants which are mostly found within Africa but some of which can be found in Europe. Many of these species are endangered and a few are already extinct. The weather is generally cool but summers are sunny, and the average temperature there is 25 °C. The Atlas Mountains have earned a reputation as a trekkers’ den, attracting adventurers year-round.

==Geology==
The basement rock of most of Africa was formed during the Precambrian supereon and is much older than the Atlas Mountains lying on the continent. The Atlas was formed during three subsequent phases of Earth&#x27;s geology.

The first tectonic deformation phase involves only the Anti-Atlas, which was formed in the Paleozoic Era (~300 million years ago) as the result of continental collisions. North America, Europe and Africa were connected millions of years ago.

The Anti-Atlas Mountains are believed to have originally been formed as part of the Alleghenian orogeny. These mountains were formed when Africa and America collided and were once a chain rivaling today&#x27;s Himalayas. Today, the remains of this chain can be seen in the Fall Line region in the Eastern United States. Some remnants can also be found in the later formed Appalachians in North America.

A second phase took place during the Mesozoic Era (before ~66 My). It consisted of a widespread extension of the Earth&#x27;s crust that rifted and separated the continents mentioned above. This extension was responsible for the formation of many thick intracontinental sedimentary basins including the present Atlas. Most of the rocks forming the surface of the present High Atlas were deposited under the ocean at that time.

In the Paleogene and Neogene Periods (~66 million to ~1.8 million years ago), the mountain chains that today constitute the Atlas were uplifted, as the land masses of Europe and Africa collided at the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula. Such convergent tectonic boundaries occur where two plates slide towards each other forming a subduction zone (if one plate moves underneath the other), and/or a continental collision (when the two plates contain continental crust). In the case of the Africa-Europe collision, it is clear that tectonic convergence is partially responsible for the formation of the High Atlas, as well as for the closure of the Strait of Gibraltar and the formation of the Alps and the Pyrenees.

However, there is a lack of evidence for the nature of the subduction in the Atlas region, or for the thickening of the Earth&#x27;s crust generally associated with continental collisions. One of the most striking features of the Atlas to geologists is the relatively small amount of crustal thickening and tectonic shortening despite the important altitude of the mountain range. Recent studies suggest that deep processes rooted in the Earth&#x27;s mantle may have contributed to the uplift of the High and Middle Atlas.
===Natural resources===
The Atlas are rich in natural resources. There are deposits of iron ore, lead ore, copper, silver, mercury, rock salt, phosphate, marble, anthracite coal and natural gas among other resources.

==Subranges==

The range can be divided into four general regions:

* Anti-Atlas, High Atlas and Middle Atlas (Morocco)
* Tell Atlas (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia)
* Aurès Mountains (Algeria, Tunisia)
* Saharan Atlas (Algeria)

===Anti-Atlas===
The Anti-Atlas extends from the Atlantic Ocean in the southwest of Morocco toward the northeast to the heights of Ouarzazate and further east to the city of Tafilalt (altogether a distance of approximately ). In the south it borders the Sahara. The easternmost point of the anti-Atlas is the Jbel Saghro range and its northern boundary is flanked by sections of the High Atlas range. It includes the Djebel Siroua, a massif of volcanic origin with the highest summit of the range at 3,304 m. The Jebel Bani is a much lower range running along the southern side of the Anti Atlas.

===High Atlas===

The High Atlas in central Morocco rises in the west at the Atlantic coast and stretches in an eastern direction to the Moroccan-Algerian border. It has several peaks over , including the highest summit in North Africa, Toubkal (), and further east Ighil m&#x27;Goun (), the second major summit of the range. At the Atlantic and to the southwest, the range drops abruptly and makes a transition to the coast and the Anti-Atlas range. To the north, in the direction of Marrakesh, the range descends less abruptly. On the heights of Ouarzazate the massif is cut through by the Draa Valley which opens southward. It is mainly inhabited by Berber people, who live in small villages and cultivate the high plains of the Ourika Valley. Near Barrage Cavagnac there is a hydroelectric dam that has created the artificial lake Lalla Takerkoust. The lake serves also as a source for fish for the local fishermen.

The largest villages and towns of the area are Ouarzazate, Tahannaout, Amizmiz, Imlil, Tin Mal and Ijoukak.

===Middle Atlas===
The Middle Atlas is completely in Morocco and is the northernmost of its three main Atlas ranges. The range lies north of the High Atlas, separated by the Moulouya and Oum Er-Rbia rivers, and south of the Rif mountains, separated by the Sebou River. To the west are the main coastal plains of Morocco with many of the major cities and, to the east, the high barren plateau that lies between the Saharan and Tell Atlas. The high point of the range is the jbel Bou Naceur (3340 m). The Middle Atlas experiences more rain than the ranges to the south, making it an important water catchment for the coastal plains and important for biodiversity. It is home to the majority of the world&#x27;s population of Barbary macaque.

===Saharan Atlas===
The Saharan Atlas of Algeria runs east of the High Atlas, crossing Algeria from the Moroccan border and into Tunisia. The Aures Mountains are often presented as being the easternmost part of the Saharan Atlas. Though not as high as the High Atlas, they reach similar altitudes as the Tell Atlas range that runs to the north of them and closer to the coast. The highest peak in the range, outside of the Aures Mountains, is the high Djebel Aissa. They mark the northern edge of the Sahara Desert. The mountains see some rainfall and are better suited to agriculture than the plateau region to the north. Today, most of the population of the region are Berbers (Imazighen).

===Tell Atlas===

The Tell Atlas is a mountain chain over in length, belonging to the Atlas mountain ranges and stretching from Eastern Morocco to Tunisia, and through Algeria. It parallels the Mediterranean coast and joins with the Saharan Atlas in Eastern Algeria and Tunisia. The highest summit of the Tell Atlas is the Lalla Khadidja in the Djurdjura range of Kabylia. The western end of the Tell Atlas merges with the Middle Atlas range in Morocco.

The area immediately to the south of the Tell Atlas is the high plateau of the Hautes Plaines, with lakes in the wet season and salt flats in the dry. The eastern half of the Tell Atlas has the most humid climate of North Africa, with annual precipitation reaching well above , and sometimes over like in the Collo Peninsula or near Ain Draham. An important amount of snow falls on the summits in winter.

===Aurès===
The Aurès Mountains are the easternmost portion of the Atlas mountain range. It covers parts of Algeria and Tunisia. The Aurès natural region is named after the range.

==Flora and fauna==

Flora in the mountains include the Atlas cedar, evergreen oak and many semi-evergreen oaks such as the Algerian oak.

Animals that live in the area include the Barbary macaque (misnamed as the Barbary ape), Barbary leopard, Barbary stag, Barbary sheep, Atlas Mountain badger, Cuvier&#x27;s gazelle, North African boar, striped hyena, red fox, northern bald ibis, Algerian nuthatch, dipper, and Atlas mountain viper.

Many animals used to inhabit the Atlas mountains such as the Atlas bear, North African elephant, North African aurochs, bubal hartebeest and Atlas wild ass, but these subspecies are all extinct. Barbary lions are currently extinct in the wild, but descendants exist in captivity.

<text>In European architectural sculpture, an atlas (also known as an atlant, or atlante or atlantid; plural atlantes) is a support sculpted in the form of a man, which may take the place of a column, a pier or a pilaster. The Roman term for such a sculptural support is ]]telamon&quot;&#x27; (plural telamones or telamons).

The term &quot;atlantes&quot; is the Greek plural of the name Atlas—the Titan who was forced to hold the sky on his shoulders for eternity. The alternative term, &quot;telamones&quot;, also is derived from a later mythological hero, Telamon, one of the Argonauts, who was the father of Ajax. 

The caryatid is the female precursor of this architectural form in Greece, a woman standing in the place of each column or pillar. Caryatids are found at the treasuries at Delphi and the Erechtheion on the Acropolis at Athens for Athene. They usually are in an Ionic context and represented a ritual association with the goddesses worshiped within. The Atlante is typically life-size or larger; smaller similar figures in the decorative arts are called terms. The body of many Atlantes turns into a rectangular pillar or other architectural feature around the waist level, a feature borrowed from the term. The pose and expression of Atlantes very often show their effort to bear the heavy load of the building, which is rarely the case with terms and caryatids. The herma or herm is a classical boundary marker or wayside monument to a god which is usually a square pillar with only a carved head on top, about life-size, and male genitals at the appropriate mid-point. Figures that are rightly called Atlantes may sometimes be described as herms.

Atlantes express extreme effort in their function, heads bent forward to support the weight of the structure above them across their shoulders, forearms often lifted to provide additional support, providing an architectural motif. Atlantes and caryatids were noted by the Roman late Republican architect Vitruvius, whose description of the structures, rather than surviving examples, transmitted the idea of atlantes to the Renaissance architectural vocabulary.

==Origin==
Not only did the Caryatids precede them, but similar architectural figures already had been made in ancient Egypt out of monoliths. Atlantes originated in Greek Sicily and in Magna Graecia, Southern Italy. The earliest surviving atlantes are fallen ones from the Early Classical Greek temple of Zeus, the &quot;Olympeion&quot;, in Agrigento, Sicily. Atlantes also played a significant role in Mannerist and Baroque architecture. 

During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the designs of many buildings featured glorious atlantes that looked much like Greek originals. Their inclusion in the final design
for the portico of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg that was built for Tsar Nicholas I of Russia in the 1840’s made the use of atlantes especially fashionable. The Hermitage portico incorporates ten enormous atlantes, approximately three times life-size, carved from Serdobol granite, which were designed by Johann Halbig and executed by the sculptor Alexander Terebenev.

==Mesoamerica==
Similar carved stone columns or pillars in the shape of fierce men at some sites of Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica are typically called Atlantean figures. These figures are considered to be &quot;massive statues of Toltec warriors&quot;.

<text>The Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (), TWSE Capitalization Weighted Stock Index, or TAIEX () is a stock market index for companies traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE). The TAIEX covers all of the listed stocks excluding preferred stocks, full-delivery stocks and newly listed stocks, which are listed for less than one calendar month. It was first published in 1967 by TWSE with 1966 being the base year with a value of 100.

The Taiwanese stock market experienced a &quot;bubble economy&quot; from 1986 to 1990. When in 1986 the index was around 1000 points, it reached a peak of over 12,000 points in February 1990 then plummeted to around 2500 points by October 1990.

<text>In mathematics, particularly topology, an atlas is a concept used to describe a manifold. An atlas consists of individual &quot;charts&quot; that, roughly speaking, describe individual regions of the manifold. In general, the notion of atlas underlies the formal definition of a manifold and related structures such as vector bundles and other fiber bundles.

==Charts==


The definition of an atlas depends on the notion of a &quot;chart&quot;. A chart for a topological space &quot;M&quot; is a homeomorphism formula_1 from an open subset &quot;U&quot; of &quot;M&quot; to an open subset of a Euclidean space. The chart is traditionally recorded as the ordered pair formula_2.

When a coordinate system is chosen in the Euclidean space, this defines coordinates on formula_3: the coordinates of a point formula_4 of formula_3 are defined as the coordinates of formula_6 The pair formed by a chart and such a coordinate system is called a local coordinate system, coordinate chart, coordinate patch, coordinate map, or local frame.

==Formal definition of atlas==
An atlas for a topological space formula_7 is an indexed family formula_8 of charts on formula_7 which covers formula_7 (that is, formula_11). If for some fixed &quot;n&quot;, the image of each chart is an open subset of &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space, then formula_7 is said to be an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifold. 

The plural of atlas is &quot;atlases&quot;, although some authors use &quot;atlantes&quot;.

An atlas formula_13 on an formula_14-dimensional manifold formula_7 is called an adequate atlas if the following conditions hold:

* The image of each chart is either formula_16 or formula_17, where formula_17 is the closed half-space,
* formula_19 is a locally finite open cover of formula_7, and
* formula_21, where formula_22 is the open ball of radius 1 centered at the origin.

Every second-countable manifold admits an adequate atlas. Moreover, if formula_23 is an open covering of the second-countable manifold formula_7, then there is an adequate atlas formula_13 on formula_7, such that formula_27 is a refinement of formula_28.

==Transition maps==

A transition map provides a way of comparing two charts of an atlas. To make this comparison, we consider the composition of one chart with the inverse of the other. This composition is not well-defined unless we restrict both charts to the intersection of their domains of definition. (For example, if we have a chart of Europe and a chart of Russia, then we can compare these two charts on their overlap, namely the European part of Russia.)

To be more precise, suppose that formula_29 and formula_30 are two charts for a manifold &quot;M&quot; such that formula_31 is non-empty.
The transition map formula_32 is the map defined by
formula_33

Note that since formula_34 and formula_35 are both homeomorphisms, the transition map formula_36 is also a homeomorphism.

==More structure==
One often desires more structure on a manifold than simply the topological structure. For example, if one would like an unambiguous notion of differentiation of functions on a manifold, then it is necessary to construct an atlas whose transition functions are differentiable. Such a manifold is called differentiable. Given a differentiable manifold, one can unambiguously define the notion of tangent vectors and then directional derivatives.

If each transition function is a smooth map, then the atlas is called a smooth atlas, and the manifold itself is called smooth. Alternatively, one could require that the transition maps have only &quot;k&quot; continuous derivatives in which case the atlas is said to be formula_37.

Very generally, if each transition function belongs to a pseudogroup formula_38 of homeomorphisms of Euclidean space, then the atlas is called a formula_39-atlas. If the transition maps between charts of an atlas preserve a local trivialization, then the atlas defines the structure of a fibre bundle.

<text>Pope Paul III (; ; born Alessandro Farnese; 29 February 1468 – 10 November 1549) was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 13 October 1534 to his death, in November 1549.

He came to the papal throne in an era following the sack of Rome in 1527 and rife with uncertainties in the Catholic Church as the Protestant Reformation progressed. His pontificate initiated the Catholic Reformation with the Council of Trent in 1545, and witnessed wars of religion in which Emperor Charles V launched military campaigns against the Protestants in Germany. He recognized new Catholic religious orders and societies such as the Jesuits, the Barnabites, and the Congregation of the Oratory. His efforts were distracted by nepotism to advance the power and fortunes of his family, including his illegitimate son Pier Luigi Farnese.

Paul III was a significant patron of artists, including Michelangelo, and Nicolaus Copernicus dedicated his heliocentric treatise to him.

==Biography==

===Early career and family===
Born in 1468 at Canino, Latium (then part of the Papal States), Alessandro Farnese was the second son of Pier Luigi I Farnese, Signore di Montalto (1435–1487) and Giovanna Caetani, a member of the Caetani family which had produced Pope Gelasius II and Pope Boniface VIII. The Farnese family had prospered over the centuries, but it was Alessandro&#x27;s ascendency to the papacy and his dedication to family interests which brought about the most significant increase in the family&#x27;s wealth and power.

Alessandro was given a humanist education at the University of Pisa and the court of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici. Initially trained as an apostolic notary, he joined the Roman Curia in 1491 and in 1493 Pope Alexander VI appointed him Cardinal-Deacon of &quot;Santi Cosma e Damiano&quot;. Alessandro&#x27;s sister, Giulia, was reputedly a mistress of Alexander VI, and might have been instrumental in securing this appointment for her brother. For this reason, he was sometimes mockingly referred to as the &quot;Borgia brother-in-law,&quot; just as Giulia was mocked as &quot;the Bride of Christ.&quot; Much later (in 1535), the Venetian nobleman Soriano recorded that Alessandro was called &quot;cardinale Fregnese&quot; (Cardinal P*ssy, or Cardinal C*nt) on account of the relationship between his sister and Alexander VI.

As a young cleric, Alessandro lived a notably dissolute life, taking a mistress, Silvia Ruffini. Between about 1500 and 1510, she gave birth to at least four children: Costanza, Pier Luigi (who was later created Duke of Parma), Paolo, and Ranuccio. In July 1505, Pope Julius II legitimated the two eldest sons so that they could inherit the Farnese family estates. On 23 June 1513, Pope Leo X published a second legitimation of Pier Luigi, and also legitimized Ranuccio (the second son Paolo had already died).

On 28 March 1509, Alessandro was named Bishop of Parma, but he was not ordained a priest until 26 June 1519 and not consecrated a bishop until 2 July 1519. As Bishop of Parma, he came under the influence of his vicar-general, Bartolomeo Guidiccioni. This led to Alessandro breaking off the relationship with his mistress and committing himself to reform in his diocese. Under Pope Clement VII (1523–34) he was named Cardinal Bishop of Ostia and Dean of the College of Cardinals.

==Pontificate==
===Papal election===
On the death of Clement VII in 1534, he was elected as Pope Paul III on 13 October 1534. Farnese, who did not fall within any of the factions, was considered a very good choice by the cardinals since his state of health denoted a short papacy which would give those cardinals time to select a proper candidate for a future conclave. On 3 November, Paul III was formally crowned by the protodeacon Innocenzo Cybo.

The elevation to the cardinalate of his grandsons, Alessandro Farnese, aged 14, and Guido Ascanio Sforza, aged 16, displeased the reform party and drew a protest from Emperor Charles V, but this was forgiven when, shortly after, he introduced into the Sacred College Reginald Pole, Gasparo Contarini, Jacopo Sadoleto, and Giovanni Pietro Caraffa, who would become Pope Paul IV.

===Politics and religion===
The fourth pope during the period of the Protestant Reformation, Paul III became the first to take active reform measures in response to Protestantism. Soon after his elevation, 2 June 1536, Paul III summoned a general council to meet at Mantua in the following May, but the opposition of the Protestant princes and the refusal of Federico II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua to assume the responsibility of maintaining order frustrated the project. Paul III first deferred for a year and then discarded the whole project.

In 1536, Paul III invited a committee of nine eminent prelates, distinguished by learning and piety alike, to report on the reformation and rebuilding of the Church. In 1537 they produced the celebrated &quot;Consilium de emendenda ecclesia&quot;, exposing gross abuses in the Roman Curia, the church administration, and public worship; and proffering bold proposals aimed at abolishing such abuses. The report was widely printed, and the pope was in earnest when he took up the problem of reform. He clearly perceived that Emperor Charles V would not rest until the problems were grappled with in earnest.

However, to the Protestants, the report seemed far from thorough; Martin Luther had his edition (1538) prefaced with a vignette showing the cardinals cleaning the Augean stable of the Roman Church with foxtails instead of brooms. In the end, no results followed from the committee&#x27;s recommendations.

As a consequence of the extensive campaign against &quot;idolatry&quot; in England, culminating with the dismantling of the shrine of St. Thomas Becket at Canterbury, Paul III excommunicated Henry VIII on 17 December 1538 and issued an interdict on England.

In 1534, a decision by Paul III favoured the activity of merchants of all nationalities and religions from the Levant and allowed them to settle with their families in Ancona, which had become part of the Papal States under his predecessor Clement VII. This decision helped make Ancona a prosperous trading city for centuries to come. A Venetian travelling through Ancona in 1535 recorded that the city was &quot;full of merchants from every nation and mostly Greeks and Turks.&quot; In the second half of the 16th century, the presence of Greek and other merchants from the Ottoman Empire declined after a series of restrictive measures taken by the Italian authorities and the pope.

Around this time, family complications arose. In order to vest his grandson Ottavio Farnese with the Duchy of Camerino, Paul forcibly wrested the same from the duke of Urbino (1540). He also incurred virtual war with his own subjects and vassals by the imposition of burdensome taxes. Perugia, renouncing its obedience, was besieged by Paul&#x27;s son, Pier Luigi, and forfeited its freedom entirely on its surrender. The burghers of Colonna were duly vanquished, and Ascanio was banished (1541). After this, the time seemed ripe for annihilating heresy.

In 1540, the Church officially recognized the society forming about Ignatius of Loyola, which became the Society of Jesus. In 1542, a second stage in the process of Counter-Reformation was marked by the institution, or reorganization, of the Congregation of the Holy Office of the Inquisition.

On another side, the emperor was insisting that Rome should forward his designs toward a peaceable recovery of the German Protestants. Accordingly, Paul III despatched Giovanni Morone (not as yet a cardinal) as nuncio to Hagenau and Worms in 1540; and in 1541 Cardinal Gasparo Contarini took part in the adjustment proceedings at the Conference of Regensburg. It was Contarini who proposed the famous formula &quot;by faith alone are we justified,&quot; which did not, however, supersede the Roman Catholic doctrine of good works. At Rome, this definition was rejected in the consistory of 27 May, and Luther declared that he could accept it only provided the opposers would admit that this formula constituted a change of doctrine.
However, after the Regensburg Conference had proved fruitless, the emperor insisted on a still larger council, with the final result being the Council of Trent, which finally was convoked on 15 March 1545, under the bull &quot;Laetare Hierusalem&quot;.

Meanwhile, after the peace of Crespy (September 1544), Emperor Charles V (1519 – 1556) began to put down Protestantism by force. Pending the Diet of Worms in 1545, the emperor concluded a covenant of joint action with the papal legate Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, with Paul III agreeing to aid in the projected war against the German Protestant princes and estates. This prompt acquiescence was probably grounded on personal motives: Because the emperor was preoccupied in Germany, the moment now seemed opportune for the pope to acquire for his son Pier Luigi the duchies of Parma and Piacenza. Although these belonged to the Papal States, Paul III planned to overcome the reluctance of the cardinals by exchanging these papal duchies for the less valuable domains of Camerino and Nepi. The emperor agreed, welcoming the prospect of 12,000 infantry, 500 cavalry, and considerable funds from the pope.

In Germany the campaign began in the west, where Archbishop of Cologne Hermann of Wied had converted to Protestantism in 1542. Emperor Charles began open warfare against the Protestant princes, estates, and cities allied in the Schmalkaldic League (see Philip of Hesse). Hermann was excommunicated on 16 April 1546 and compelled by the emperor to abdicate in February 1547. By the close of 1546, Charles V had subjugated South Germany. The victory at the Battle of Mühlberg on 24 April 1547 established his imperial sovereignty everywhere in Germany, and the two leaders of the League were captured. The emperor declared the Augsburg Interim as a magnanimous compromise with the defeated schismatics.
Although the emperor had subdued the German Protestant armies, he had failed to support the pope&#x27;s territorial ambitions for his son Pier Luigi, and relations between them cooled. The situation came to a total rupture when Ferrante Gonzaga, the imperial vice-regent, forcibly expelled Pier Luigi.

In 1547, the pope&#x27;s son was assassinated at Piacenza, and Paul III placed some of the blame on the emperor. In the same year, and after the death of Francis I of France (1515–47) deprived the pope of a potential ally, the stress of circumstances compelled him to accept the ecclesiastical measures in the emperor&#x27;s Interim.

With reference to the assassinated prince&#x27;s inheritance, the restitution of which Paul III demanded ostensibly in the name of the church, the pope&#x27;s design was thwarted by the emperor, who refused to surrender Piacenza, and by Pier Luigi&#x27;s heir in Parma, Ottavio Farnese.

In consequence of a violent altercation on this account with Cardinal Farnese, Paul III, at the age of 81, became so overwrought that an attack of sickness ensued from which he died on 10 November 1549.

Paul III proved unable to suppress the Protestant Reformation, but it was during his pontificate that the foundation was laid for the Counter-Reformation. He decreed the second and final excommunication of Henry VIII of England in December 1538. His efforts in Parma led to the War of Parma two years after his death.

===Slavery and &quot;Sublimis Deus&quot;===

In May–June 1537, Paul issued the bull &quot;Sublimis Deus&quot; (also known as &quot;Unigenitus&quot; and &quot;Veritas ipsa&quot;), described by Prein (2008) as the &quot;Magna Carta&quot; for the human rights of the indigenous peoples of the Americas in its declaration that &quot;the Indians were human beings and they were not to be robbed of their freedom or possessions&quot;. The subsequent implementing document &quot;Pastorale officium&quot; declared automatic excommunication for anyone who failed to abide by the new ruling.

However, it met with strong opposition from the Council of the West Indies and the Crown, which declared that it violated their patronato rights, and the pope annulled the orders the following year with the document &quot;Non Indecens Videtur&quot;. Stogre (1992) notes that &quot;Sublimis Deus&quot; is not present in Denzinger, the authoritative compendium of official Catholic teachings, and Davis (1988) asserts it was annulled due to a dispute with the Spanish crown. However, the original bull continued to circulate and be quoted by las Casas and others who supported Indian rights.

According to Falkowski (2002) &quot;Sublimis Deus&quot; had the effect of revoking the bull of Alexander VI, &quot;Inter caetera&quot;, but still leaving the colonizers the duty of converting the native people. Father Gustavo Gutierrez describes it as &quot;the most important papal document relating to the condition of native Indians and that it was addressed to all Christians&quot;. Maxwell (1975) notes that the bull did not change the traditional teaching that the enslavement of Indians was permissible if they were considered &quot;enemies of Christendom&quot;, as this would be considered by the Church as a &quot;just war&quot;. He further argues that the Indian nations had every right to self-defence. Stark - 2003 - describes the bull as &quot;magnificent&quot; and believes that it was long forgotten due to the neglect of Protestant historians. Falola noted that the bull related to the native populations of the New World and did not condemn the transatlantic slave trade stimulated by the Spanish monarchy and the Holy Roman Emperor.

In 1545, Paul repealed an ancient law that allowed slaves to claim their freedom under the emperor&#x27;s statue on Rome&#x27;s Capitoline Hill, in view of the number of homeless people and tramps in the city. The decree included those who had become Christians after their enslavement and those born to Christian slaves. The right of inhabitants of Rome to publicly buy and sell slaves of both sexes was affirmed. Stogre (1992) asserts that the lifting of restrictions was due to a shortage of slaves in Rome. In 1548, Paul authorized the purchase and possession of Muslim slaves in the Papal states.

Also in 1537, Paul issued &quot;Altitudo divini consilii&quot;. This bull discusses evangelization and conversion, including the real way to apply the sacraments, in particular baptism. This was especially important in the early days of colonial rule, when hundreds and sometimes thousands of indigenous people were baptized every day. One interesting aspect of this bull is its discussion of how to deal with local practices, for example, polygamy. After their conversion, polygamous men had to marry their first wife, but if they could not remember which wife was the first, they then &quot;could choose among the wives the one they preferred.&quot;

===Patron of the arts===
Arguably the most significant artistic work produced during Paul&#x27;s reign was the &quot;Last Judgement&quot; by Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel of the Vatican Palace. Although the work was commissioned by Paul III&#x27;s predecessor, Pope Clement VII, following the latter&#x27;s death in 1534 Paul renewed the commission and oversaw its completion in 1541.
As a cardinal, Alessandro had begun construction of the Palazzo Farnese in central Rome, and its planned size and magnificence increased upon his election to the papacy. The palace was initially designed by the architect Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, received further architectural refinement from Michelangelo, and was completed by Giacomo della Porta. Like other Farnese family buildings, the imposing palace proclaims the family&#x27;s power and wealth, similarly to Alessandro&#x27;s Villa Farnese at Caprarola. In 1546, after the death of Sangallo, Paul appointed the elderly Michelangelo to take supervision of the building of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. Paul also commissioned Michelangelo to paint the &#x27;Crucifixion of St. Peter&#x27; and the &#x27;Conversion of St. Paul&#x27; (1542–50), his last frescoes, in the Pauline Chapel of the Vatican.

Paul III&#x27;s artistic and architectural commissions were numerous and varied. The Venetian artist Titian painted a portrait of the pope in 1543, and in 1546, the well-known portrait of Paul III with his grandsons Cardinal Alessandro Farnese and Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma. Both are now in the Capodimonte Museum in Naples. The military fortifications in Rome and the Papal States were strengthened during his reign. He had Michelangelo move the ancient bronze of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius to the Capitoline Hill, where it became the centerpiece to the Piazza del Campidoglio.

===Other activities===
====Society of Jesus and religious orders====
On 27 September 1540, Paul III formally approved the establishment of the Society of Jesus in the papal bull, &quot;Regimini militantis Ecclesiae&quot;. Originally, Paul III restricted the fledgling order to 60 members in the bull &quot;Iniunctum nobis&quot;, but he lifted that restriction upon seeing just how effective they were in their missionary actions. In 1548, he permitted Saint Ignatius of Loyola to print his &quot;Spiritual Exercises&quot;.

Similarly, in 1540, Paul III approved the Rule of the Somaschi Fathers, and on 9 June 1544, he approved the Rule for the Ursulines in the bull &quot;Regimini Universalis&quot;.

====Consistories====

Throughout his papacy, Paul III elevated 71 cardinals in 12 consistories. Six of those whom he named, and later revealed publicly, were nominated &quot;in pectore&quot;. Among those he named were his three immediate successors: Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte (the future Pope Julius III), Marcello Cervini (the future Pope Marcellus II), and Gian Pietro Carafa (the future Pope Paul IV). Among those he named were Reginald Pole, Rodrigo Luis de Borja y de Castre-Pinós (the great-great-grandson of Pope Alexander VI), Ippolito II d&#x27;Este (the grandson of Pope Alexander VI), and Enrique de Borja y Aragón (the great-grandson of Pope Alexander VI). Paul III also named John Fisher as a cardinal, but King Henry VIII had him executed after warning the pope not to nominate him.

In 1535, Paul III intended to nominate Desiderius Erasmus to the cardinalate, but he declined on the grounds of ill health and his age. In preparations for the 1542 consistory, Paul III intended to nominate Giovanni Guidiccioni, but the latter died before the consistory took place. In that 1542 consistory, according to Conradus Eubel, the pope is said to have reserved an undefined number of other cardinals &quot;in pectore&quot;.

====Canonizations====
During his papacy, Paul III canonized Ginés de la Jara (1541).

== Death ==

On 3 November 1549, Paul III celebrated the anniversary of his papal coronation. However, the pope was severely depressed by the deceit of his own family and the fall of Parma to Emperor Charles V, and it is known that he had a very heated argument with his cardinal nephew, Alessandro Farnese, to the point that he grabbed his red beretta, tore it into shreds, and threw it down to the ground in his anger. He had worked himself up so much to the point that he may have suffered a heart attack. On 6 November, the pope suddenly contracted a fever, retreating to the Quirinal Hill where he had hoped that the fresher air would help ease his malady. On 7 November, the agent of King Ferdinand I of Bohemia and Hungary, Diego Lasso, wrote that the pope&#x27;s temperature had increased that morning, while the French ambassador in Rome reported to King Henry II of France that Paul III suffered from a catarrh at 7:00 pm, opining that the pope had very little time to live. 

Paul III died on 10 November 1549 from a catarrh. It is said that he repented of his nepotism on his deathbed.

Paul III&#x27;s bronze tomb, executed by Guglielmo della Porta, is located in Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

==Fictional portrayal==
Stendhal&#x27;s novel &quot;La Chartreuse de Parme&quot; was inspired by an inauthentic Italian account of the dissolute youth of Alessandro Farnese.

The character of Pope Paul III, played by Peter O&#x27;Toole, in the series &quot;The Tudors&quot; is loosely inspired by him. The young Alessandro Farnese is played by Diarmuid Noyes in the serial &quot;Borgia&quot; and by Cyron Melville in &quot;The Borgias&quot;. His image is portrayed in a parody of the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover, placed inside of the album &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot; by the Mothers of Invention.

<doc id="47443" wikidata="Q230728" url="?curid=47443" title="Vera Wang">
<text>Vera Ellen Wang (; born June 27, 1949) is an American fashion designer. Wang initially pursued a career in figure skating before transitioning to fashion. She worked for &quot;Vogue&quot; and Ralph Lauren before launching her own bridal gown boutique in 1990.

Wang gained international recognition for her wedding dress designs. Her gowns have been worn by numerous celebrities. She expanded her brand to include ready-to-wear fashion, accessories, fragrances, and home goods. In December of 2024, Wang sold her namesake brand after 35 years in business to WHP Global.

== Early life ==
Vera Ellen Wang was born June 27, 1949, in New York City to Chinese parents who immigrated to the United States in the mid-1940s. Her mother, Florence Wu (Wu Chifang), worked as a translator for the United Nations, while her father, Cheng Ching Wang (Wang Chengqing), a graduate of Yanjing University and MIT, owned a medicine company, and held the following positions: Director, Singapore Petroleum Company Pte. Ltd., Chairman &amp; President, Oceanic Petroleum Corporation, Chairman &amp; President, Oceanic Petroleum (Asia) Corporation, Chairman &amp; President of Summit Group of Companies (now U.S. Summit Company), Chairman of the Vera Wang Group 1990-1998. Wang has one brother, Kenneth, who is a life member of MIT Corporation, a board of trustees that governs the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Wang began figure skating at the age of eight, training under Peter Dunfield and Sonya Klopfer in Denver during the summers and with the Skating Club of New York during the rest of the year. While in high school, she trained with pairs partner James Stuart, and competed at the 1968 U.S. Figure Skating Championships. She was featured in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; &quot;Faces in the Crowd&quot; in the January 9, 1968 issue. When she failed to make the U.S. Olympics team, she said, &quot;I was devastated when I did not qualify for the Olympic team.&quot; Then she entered the fashion industry. Wang continues to enjoy skating, saying, &quot;Skating is multidimensional&quot;.

Wang attended Friends Seminary, graduated from Chapin School in 1967, attended the University of Paris, and earned a degree in art history from Sarah Lawrence College. 

In 1968, Wang was presented as a debutante to high society at the International Debutante Ball at the Waldorf Astoria New York.

==Career==
Wang was hired to be an editor at &quot;Vogue&quot; immediately upon graduation from Sarah Lawrence College, making her the youngest editor at that magazine. She stayed at &quot;Vogue&quot; for 17 years, leaving in 1987 to join Ralph Lauren, for whom she worked for two years. At 40, she resigned and became an independent bridal wear designer.
Wang has made wedding gowns for public figures such as Hayley Williams, Vanessa Hudgens, Chelsea Clinton, Karenna Gore, Ivanka Trump, Campbell Brown, Alicia Keys, Mariah Carey, Victoria Beckham, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Avril Lavigne, Hilary Duff, Khloe Kardashian, and Kim Kardashian. Wang started off as being best known for her elegant wedding dresses. Wang&#x27;s evening wear has also been worn by Michelle Obama.

Figure skaters who have worn costumes designed by Wang at the Winter Olympic Games include Nancy Kerrigan (1992 and 1994), Michelle Kwan (1998 and 2002), Evan Lysacek (2010), and Nathan Chen (2018 and 2022). Wang was inducted into the U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2009 for her contribution to the sport as a costume designer. She designed the uniforms worn by the Philadelphia Eagles Cheerleaders.

On October 23, 2001, her book &quot;Vera Wang on Weddings&quot; was released. In June 2005, she won the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) Womenswear Designer of the Year. On May 27, 2006, Wang was awarded the André Leon Talley Lifetime Achievement Award from the Savannah College of Art and Design.

Wang&#x27;s evening wear has been worn by stars at many red carpet events, including Viola Davis at the 2012 Academy Awards, and Sofia Vergara at the 65th Emmy Awards.

She was awarded the Council of Fashion Designers of America Lifetime Achievement Award in 2013.

In 2006, Wang reached a deal with Kohl&#x27;s, a chain of department stores, to produce a less expensive line of ready-to-wear clothing exclusively for them called Simply Vera.

Forbes placed her the 34th in the list America&#x27;s Richest Self-Made Women 2018, her revenues rising to $630 million in that year.

On September 10, 2019, after a sabbatical of 2 years during which she had presented her collections only via films, Vera Wang returned to the New York Fashion Week runway for her Spring/Summer 2020 fashion show, which celebrated the 30th anniversary of her brand. The show received very positive reviews, with Godfrey Deeny describing it as a &quot;notable collection by one of the few New York designers with a truly distinctive fashion DNA&quot;, while Bridget Foley presented Wang&#x27;s creations as &quot;Beautiful, seriously designed clothes, presented with gutsy panache&quot;. However, the show was marred by several major footwear malfunctions, especially during the finale when four models fell down, including Fei Fei Sun, who fell twice in a row, leading chief fashion critic Vanessa Friedman to state that &quot;In 2019, no woman should be tortured by what she wears&quot;.

In December 2024, WHP Global, a brand management firm based in New York, announced an agreement to acquire the IP of the Vera Wang fashion brand. As part of the transaction, Wang herself will continue the role as Founder &amp; Chief Creative Officer and will join WHP Global as a shareholder.

==Retail==
In 1990, Wang opened her first design salon in the Carlyle Hotel in New York City that features her trademark bridal gowns. She has since opened bridal boutiques in New York, London, Tokyo, and Sydney and has also expanded her brand through her fragrance, jewelry, eyewear, shoes, and homeware collections.

&quot;White by Vera Wang&quot; launched on February 11, 2011, at David&#x27;s Bridal. Prices of the bridal gowns range from $600 to $1,400. In 2002, Wang began to enter the home fashion industry and launched The Vera Wang China and Crystal Collection, followed by the 2007 release of her diffusion line called Simply Vera, which are sold exclusively by Kohl&#x27;s.

In spring 2012, Wang teamed up with Men&#x27;s Wearhouse to offer two tuxedo styles available in both the retail and rental areas of their inventory.
In June 2012, she expanded in Australia with the opening of &quot;Vera Wang Bride Sydney&quot; and her first Asian flagship store &quot;Vera Wang Bridal Korea&quot;, helmed by President Jung Mi-ri, in upmarket neighborhood Cheongdam-dong in Gangnam-gu, Seoul.

In a 2013 interview with CBS, Wang described her transition from journalist to businesswoman as &quot;painful, and not only that, I have no choice. So I think when you start there&#x27;s a certain innocence because of that freedom, and as you evolve you begin to see the parameters of what you can and can&#x27;t do. So I make decisions that are very tiny that will affect an hour of work, I make decisions that will impact the lives of the people that work for me. It&#x27;s in fashion as well, micro work, a centimeter of proportion and then it&#x27;s macro to see what a vision is on the red carpet.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In June 1989, Wang married investor Arthur P. Becker in an interfaith Baptist and Jewish ceremony. They have two daughters, both of whom were adopted. In July 2012, the couple announced their separation.

==In popular culture==
Several movies and television shows have featured Wang&#x27;s works, including &quot;The West Wing&quot;, &quot;The Newsroom&quot;, &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, &quot;Revenge&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and the film &quot;Sex and the City&quot;.

Wang appeared in a cameo in season 5 episode 11 of the TV series &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; and as herself in the second season of &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; in episode 2.07.

<text>A copycat suicide is defined as an emulation of another suicide that the person attempting suicide knows about either from local knowledge or due to accounts or depictions of the original suicide on television and in other media. The publicized suicide serves as a trigger, in the absence of protective factors, for the next suicide by a susceptible or suggestible person. This is referred to as suicide contagion.

A spike in emulation suicides after a widely publicized suicide is known as the Werther effect, after rumours of such a spike following the publication of Goethe&#x27;s novel &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot;.

Suicides occasionally spread through a school system, through a community, or in terms of a celebrity suicide wave, nationally. This is called a suicide cluster. &quot;Point clusters&quot; are clusters of suicides in both time and space, and have been linked to direct social learning from nearby individuals. &quot;Mass clusters&quot; are clusters of suicides in time but not space, and have been linked to the broadcasting of information concerning celebrity suicides via the mass media.

== History ==

One of the earliest known associations between the media and suicide arose from Goethe&#x27;s novel &quot;Die Leiden des jungen Werthers&quot; (&quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot;). Soon after its publication in 1774, young men began to mimic the main character by dressing in yellow pants and blue jackets. In the novel, Werther shoots himself with a pistol after he is rejected by the woman he loves, and shortly after its publication there were reports of young men using the same method to kill themselves in acts of hopelessness.

This resulted in the book being banned in several places. Hence the term &quot;Werther effect&quot; is used in the technical literature to designate copycat suicides. The term was coined by researcher David Phillips in 1974.

Reports in 1985 and 1989 by Phillips and his colleagues found that suicides and other accidents seem to rise after a well-publicized suicide.

== Demographic factors ==
People who are young or old – but not middle-aged – seem to be most susceptible to this effect. At least five percent of youth suicides may be influenced by contagion.

Due to the effects of differential identification, the people who attempt to copy a suicidal act tend to have the same age and gender as the triggering suicide.

According to a study from four South Korean researchers, the rate of suicide significantly increased following celebrity suicides between 2005 and 2008. Additionally, substantial upsurges were discovered in the subgroups that corresponded to each celebrity, particularly in the group when all variables (sex, age, and technique) were comparable.

== Timing ==
These suicidal actions tend to happen in the days and sometimes weeks after a suicide is announced. In exceptional cases, such as a widely discussed suicide by a celebrity, an increased level of thinking about suicide may persist for up to one year.

== Factors in suicide reporting ==
Copycat suicide is mostly blamed on the media. A study conducted in 2002 found evidence that &quot;the influence of media on suicidal behaviour has been shown for newspaper and television reports of actual suicides, film and television portrayals of suicides, and suicide in literature, especially suicide manuals.&quot; &quot;Hearing about a suicide seems to make those who are vulnerable feel they have permission to do it,&quot; Phillips said. He cited studies that showed that people were more likely to engage in dangerous deviant behavior, such as drug taking, if someone else had set the example first.

The Werther effect not only predicts an increase in suicide, but the majority of the suicides will take place in the same or a similar way as the one publicized. The more similar the person in the publicized suicide is to the people exposed to the information about it, the more likely the age group or demographic is to die by suicide. The increase generally happens only in areas where the suicide story was highly publicized. Upon learning of someone else&#x27;s suicide, some people decide that action may be appropriate for them as well, especially if the publicized suicide was of someone in a situation similar to their own.

Publishing the means of suicides, romanticized and sensationalized reporting—particularly about celebrities, suggestions that there is an epidemic, glorifying the deceased and simplifying the reasons all lead to increases in the suicide rate. People may see suicide as a glamorous ending, with the deceased getting attention, sympathy, and concern that they never got in life. A second possible factor is that vulnerable youth may feel, &quot;If they couldn&#x27;t cut it, neither can I&quot;. An increased rate of suicides has been shown to occur up to ten days after a television report. Studies in Japan and Germany have replicated findings of an imitative effect. Etzersdorfer et al. in an Austrian study showed a strong correlation between the number of papers distributed in various areas and the number of subsequent firearm suicides in each area after a related media report. Higher rates of copycat suicides have been found in those with similarities in race, age, and gender to the deceased in the original report. However, a study from South Korea found that preventative measures restricting how the news reports on suicide do not have much effect, possibly suggesting some other causal factor is at play for changing suicide rates.

Stack analyzed the results from 42 studies and found that those measuring the effect of a celebrity suicide story were 14.3 times more likely to find a copycat effect than studies that did not. Studies based on a real as opposed to a fictional story were 4.03 times more likely to uncover a copycat effect and research based on televised stories was 82% less likely to report a copycat effect than research based on newspapers. Other scholars have been less certain about whether copycat suicides truly happen or are selectively hyped. For instance, fears of a suicide wave following the suicide of Kurt Cobain never materialized in an actual increase in suicides. Coverage of Cobain&#x27;s suicide in the local Seattle area focused largely on treatment for mental health issues, suicide prevention and the suffering Cobain&#x27;s death caused to his family. Perhaps as a result, the local suicide rate actually declined in the following months.

Furthermore, there is evidence for an indirect Werther effect, i.e. the perception that suicidal media content influences others which, in turn, can concurrently or additionally influence one person&#x27;s own future thoughts and behaviors. Similarly, the researcher Gerard Sullivan has critiqued research on copycat suicides, suggesting that data analyses have been selective and misleading and that the evidence for copycat suicides is much less consistent than suggested by some researchers. Additionally, a review by Cheng and colleagues finds that most research on the relationship of media coverage to suicidality lacks solid theoretical grounding, making interpreting the research very difficult. Sonia Livingstone argues that media effects research as a whole has many flaws, and needs serious evaluation as a field before additional interpretations can be drawn from such research.

Studies show a high incidence of psychiatric disorders in suicide cases at the time of their death with the total figure ranging from 87.3% to 98%, with mood disorders and substance abuse being the two most common.

== Social proof model ==
An alternate model to explain copycat suicide, called &quot;social proof&quot; by Robert Cialdini, goes beyond the theories of glorification and simplification of reasons to look at why copycat suicides are so similar, demographically and in actual methods, to the originally publicized suicide. In the social proof model, people imitate those who seem similar, despite or even because of societal disapproval. This model is important because it has nearly opposite ramifications for what the media ought to do about the copycat suicide effect than the standard model does. To deal with this problem, Alex Mesoudi of Queen Mary University of London, developed a computer model of a community of 1000 people, to examine how copycat suicides occur. These were divided into 100 groups of 10, in a model designed to represent different levels of social organization, such as schools or hospitals within a town or state. Mesoudi then circulated the simulation through 100 generations. He found the simulated people acted just as sociologists&#x27; theory predicted. They were more likely to die by suicide in clusters, either because they had learned this trait from their friends, or because suicidal people are more likely to be like one another.

== Journalism codes ==
Various countries have national journalism codes which range from one extreme of, &quot;Suicide and attempted suicide should in general never be given any mention&quot; (Norway) to a more moderate, &quot;In cases of suicide, publishing or broadcasting information in an exaggerated way that goes beyond normal dimensions of reporting with the purpose of influencing readers or spectators should not occur.&quot; University of London psychologist Alex Mesoudi recommends that reporters follow the sort of guidelines the World Health Organization and others endorse for coverage of any suicide: use extreme restraint in covering these deaths—keep the word &quot;suicide&quot; out of the headline, don&#x27;t romanticize the death, and limit the number of stories. &quot;Photography, pictures, visual images or film depicting such cases should not be made public&quot; (Turkey). While many countries do not have national codes, media outlets still often have in-house guidelines along similar lines. In the United States, there are no industry-wide standards. A survey of in-house guides of 16 US daily newspapers showed that only three mentioned the word &quot;suicide,&quot; and none gave guidelines about publishing the method of suicide. Craig Branson, online director of the American Society of News Editors (ASNE), has been quoted as saying, &quot;Industry codes are very generic and totally voluntary. Most ethical decisions are left to individual editors at individual papers. The industry would fight any attempt to create more specific rules or standards, and editors would no doubt ignore them.&quot; Guidelines on the reporting of suicides in Ireland were introduced with attempt to remove any positive connotations the act might have (e.g. using the term &quot;completed&quot; rather than &quot;successful&quot; when describing a suicide attempt which resulted in a death).

Canada&#x27;s public broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, abides by standards that &quot;avoid describing the act in detail or illustrating the method&quot; of suicides.

=== Journalist training ===
Australia is one of the few countries where there is a concerted effort to teach journalism students about this subject. In the 2000s, the Mindframe national media initiative followed an ambivalent response by the Australian Press Council to an earlier media resource kit issued by Suicide Prevention Australia and the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention. The UK-based media ethics charity MediaWise provides training for journalists on reporting suicide and related issues.

Headline is Ireland&#x27;s media monitoring programme for suicide and mental health issues, set up by Shine and the Health Service Executives National Office for Suicide Prevention as part of the program Reach Out: National Strategy for action on Suicide Prevention. Headline works with media professionals and students to find ways to collaborate to ensure that suicide, mental health and mental illness are responsibly covered in the media and provides information on reporting on mental health and suicidal behavior, literature and daily analysis of news stories. Headline also serves as a vehicle for the public to become involved in helping to monitor the Irish media on issues relating to mental health and suicide.

Studies suggest that the risk of suicide fell significantly when media outlets began following recommendations for suicide reporting in the late 20th century.

== Prevention ==
The Papageno effect is the effect that mass media can have by presenting non-suicide alternatives to crises. It is named after a lovelorn character, Papageno, from the 18th-century opera &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;; he was contemplating suicide until other characters showed him a different way to resolve his problems.

If a novel or news can induce self-harm, then it must be assumed that those narratives might have a positive effect on prevention. There is more research into the damage done by &quot;irresponsible media reports&quot; than into the protective effects of positive stories, but when newspapers refuse to publicize suicide events or change the way that they provide information about suicide events, the risk of copycat suicides declines.

== Late twentieth/early twenty-first century research ==
An example occurred in Vienna, Austria where the media reported a dramatic increase of copycat suicides. Reduction began when a working group of the Austrian Association for Suicide Prevention developed media guidelines and initiated discussions with the media which culminated with an agreement to abstain from reporting on cases of suicide. Examples of celebrities whose suicides have triggered suicide clusters include Ruan Lingyu, the Japanese musicians Yukiko Okada and hide, the South Korean actress Choi Jin-Sil, whose suicide caused suicide rates to rise by 162.3% and Marilyn Monroe, whose death was followed by an increase of 200 more suicides than average for that August month.

Another famous case is the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, a Tunisian street vendor who set himself on fire on December 17, 2010, an act that was a catalyst for the Tunisian Revolution and sparked the Arab Spring, including several men who emulated Bouazizi&#x27;s act.

A 2017 study published in &quot;JAMA Internal Medicine&quot; found the online series &quot;13 Reasons Why&quot; which chronicled a fictional teen&#x27;s suicide was associated with an increase in suicide related Internet searches, including a 26% increase in searches for &quot;how to commit suicide&quot;, an 18% increase for &quot;commit suicide&quot; and 9% increase for &quot;how to kill yourself&quot;. On May 29, 2019, research published in &quot;JAMA Psychiatry&quot; outlined an association of increased suicides in 10- to 19-year-olds in the United States in the three months following the release of &quot;13 Reasons Why&quot;, consistent with a media contagion of suicide in the show. However, some media scholar studies implied that viewing &quot;13 Reasons Why&quot; was not associated with suicidal ideation but actually with reduced depressive symptoms.

The cause-and-effect relationship between media and suicide is not simple to prove. Prof. Sonia Livingstone emphasized the claim of causality in media-effect cannot be considered conclusive because of different methodological approaches and disciplinary perspective. Even if it is accepted that media can have an effect on suicidal ideation, it is not a sufficient condition to drive people to commit suicide; the effects that media can have on suicidal behaviour are certainly less important than individual psychological and social risk factors.

<text>A chessboard is a game board used to play chess. It consists of 64 squares, 8 rows by 8 columns, on which the chess pieces are placed. It is square in shape and uses two colours of squares, one light and one dark, in a chequered pattern. During play, the board is oriented such that each player&#x27;s near-right corner square is a light square.

The columns of a chessboard are known as &#x27;, the rows are known as&#x27;, and the lines of adjoining same-coloured squares (each running from one edge of the board to an adjacent edge) are known as &quot;&quot;. Each square of the board is named using algebraic, descriptive, or numeric chess notation; algebraic notation is the FIDE standard. In algebraic notation, using White&#x27;s perspective, files are labeled &quot;a&quot; through &quot;h&quot; from left to right, and ranks are labeled &quot;1&quot; through &quot;8&quot; from bottom to top; each square is identified by the file and rank which it occupies. The a- through d-files constitute the , and the e- through h-files constitute the ; the 1st through 4th ranks constitute White&#x27;s side, and the 5th through 8th ranks constitute Black&#x27;s side.

== History and evolution ==
The earliest known ancestor of the chessboard is the Ashtāpada board. Among other games, it was used to play chaturanga, a historical precursor to chess, beginning around the 6th century in India. The board uses a single color for all squares and is divided into eight columns by eight rows, with marked squares called &quot;castles&quot; in the corners of each quadrant. Unlike in Ashtāpada, castles serve no function in chaturanga.

The chessboard acquired its modern chequered pattern in the 10th century with the arrival of chess in Europe. This pattern was based on that of the then-5×5 draughts board. As a result of this change, each diagonal was now highlighted by a continuous sequence of same-coloured squares, which later facilitated the introduction of the modern bishop and queen movements in the 15th century.

The Libro de los juegos (1283) contains a description of the chessboard, describing eight rows and columns as the ideal number, deeming the practice of chess on the 10×10 board too tiresome and on the 6×6 board too quick. In the 13th century, some players began using the convention that the first square of the far right column should be light-coloured; this convention was endorsed by Pedro Damiano at the end of the 15th century.

In contemporary chess, a &quot;digital board&quot; is a chess board connected to a computer that is capable of transmitting the moves to the computer itself: the information about the moves can be used to play a game against a chess engine, or simply to record the moves sequence of a game in automatic.

A digital board uses sensors to detect the pieces position and each piece move can be recorded.

In 1998 the 33rd Chess Olympiad was held in Elista: the games were digitally broadcast over the internet thanks the introduction of digital chess boards developed by Digital Game Technology: 328 boards were used for the event.

In 2003, the ex-world champion Garry Kasparov faced the chess engine X3D Fritz in a series of four matches in a virtual environment, where the computer-generated board hovered in the air in front of Kasparov, who used special glasses. This was the first man–machine game of chess performed in a completely simulated environment.

== Manufacture ==
Chessboards have been made from numerous materials over the years, such as ebony, ivory, marble, metal, glass, and plastic. They can also be found as decorative elements in plazas, gardens, and living rooms.

High-level games generally use wooden boards, while vinyl, plastic, and cardboard are common for less important tournaments and matches, as well as for home use. Additionally, some very large chessboards are built into or drawn on the ground. Rarely, decorative glass and marble boards are permitted for games conducted by national or international chess federations.

Wooden boards are traditionally made of unstained woods that are light brown and dark brown in colour. To reduce cost, some boards are made with veneers of more expensive woods glued to an inner piece of plywood or chipboard. A variety of colour combinations are used for plastic, vinyl, and silicone boards. Common dark-light combinations are black and white, as well as brown, green or blue with buff or cream.

For international or continental championships, FIDE&#x27;s regulations state that wooden boards should be used. For other FIDE tournaments, wood, plastic, or cardboard boards may be used, and the board should be rigid in all instances. The board may also be made of marble, as long as there is an appropriate contrast between the light and dark squares. The finishing should be neutral or frosted but never shiny. The squares should be from 5 to 6 cm in length, at least twice the diameter of a pawn&#x27;s base. If the table and the board are two separate pieces, the latter must be fixed so it stays in place.

==Board notation==

There are various systems for recording moves and referring to the squares of the chessboard; the standard contemporary system is algebraic notation. In algebraic notation, the files are identified by the letters &quot;a&quot; to &quot;h&quot;, from left to right from the white player&#x27;s point of view, and the ranks by the numbers &quot;1&quot; to &quot;8&quot;, with 1 being closest to the white player. Each square on the board is identified by a unique coordinate pairing, from a1 to h8.

In the older descriptive notation, the files are labelled by the piece originally occupying its first rank (e.g. queen, , ), and ranks by the numbers &quot;1&quot; to &quot;8&quot; from each player&#x27;s point of view, depending on the move being described. This method is no longer commonly used. FIDE stopped using descriptive notation in 1981.

ICCF numeric notation assigns numbers to both files and ranks, with rank 1 being the one closest to the player with the white pieces. The file leftmost to the white player (&quot;a&quot; in algebraic notation and &quot;QR&quot; in descriptive notation) is file one and the rightmost to them (&quot;h&quot; in algebraic notation and &quot;KR&quot; in descriptive notation) is file eight.
== Variant boards ==

Variant chessboard shapes and sizes go back to the Persian origins of the game in the 10th century, when the book &quot;Muraj adh-dhahab&quot; (Board of the Gods) described six different variants of chess, including circular and cylinder chess. Due to the widespread creation of new variants, a wide variety of sizes can be found. Gliński&#x27;s hexagonal chess utilises a board with 91 hexagonal spaces of three different colours. One innovation of the 13th century was the cylindrical board for use in cylinder chess.

The board used for the Persian Tamerlane chess is one of the first recorded variant chessboards, with eleven columns by ten rows along with two citadels. Each player has a citadel to the right of their second rank, which may be occupied by the opponent&#x27;s king, in which case that opponent may declare a draw. In 1617, Pietro Carrera proposed a variant that received his name, Carrera&#x27;s Chess, with a 10×8 board, later used in other variants such as Capablanca chess and Gothic Chess. Other sizes, with ten rows by ten columns, are used in Omega Chess and Grand Chess; Omega Chess has four additional squares, one in each corner of the board. Los Alamos chess uses a smaller 6×6 board.

Japanese shogi uses a board with nine columns by nine rows. The board of Chinese xianqi consists of nine columns by ten rows; here, the pieces are placed on the intersections of the lines that divide the squares, rather than within the squares themselves. Each player has a 3×3 palace in the central three columns and the closest three rows, within which the player&#x27;s general and advisors must stay. Between the central two rows is a river that the elephant cannot cross and past which the soldier increases in strength. A similar board without a river is used in Korean janggi.

Some chess variants use more than a single board per match. Bughouse chess, for example, involves four players playing two simultaneous matches on separate boards. Alice Chess is a popular variant which is usually played on two boards to facilitate the movement of pieces between the boards. Three-dimensional boards are often represented by multiple two-dimensional boards. Variants may use anywhere from two to eight boards. For example, Raumschach utilises five boards of twenty-five squares each, totaling 125 squares. Another noteworthy variant, &quot;Star Trek&quot; Chess, utilises a board of sixty-four squares divided into seven levels. &quot;Star Trek&quot; Chess uses a board with movable parts divided into seven levels. In the initial position, each player occupies two of the movable four-square attack boards. The white pieces start in the lower level, using attack boards connected to this level and the first two rows of the board, while the black pieces start at the top, using the attack boards and first two rows of the third level.
== Other representations ==

The game of chess has been represented in the arts since its creation. Chess sets usually had considerable artistic value; they were made of noble materials, such as ebony and ivory, and in large sizes. Many of the pieces in these sets were offered to churches as relics. The book Liber miraculorum sancte Fidis tells a story in which a nobleman, after miraculously escaping from prison, is forced to carry a chessboard until a sanctuary as gesture of gratitude. However, more frequently, there are stories in which the chessboard is used as a weapon. The French tale of Ogier the Dane reports how the son of Charlemagne brutally kills one of Ogier&#x27;s sons with a chessboard after losing a match, although there is no evidence confirming the veracity of the story.

In 1250, a sermon called &quot;Quaedam moralitas de scaccario per Innocentium papum&quot; (The Innocent Morality) showed the world as being represented by a chessboard. The white and black squares represented the two conditions of life and death or praise and censure; over these, the pieces, representing humanity, would confront each other in the adversities of the game, which symbolised life.

Due to its simple geometry, the chessboard is often used in mathematical puzzles or problems unrelated to chess, such as the wheat and chessboard problem and the mutilated chessboard problem. The term &quot;infinite chessboard&quot; is sometimes used to refer to a grid.

<text>The stratosphere () is the second-lowest layer of the atmosphere of Earth, located above the troposphere and below the mesosphere. The stratosphere is composed of stratified temperature zones, with the warmer layers of air located higher (closer to outer space) and the cooler layers lower (closer to the planetary surface of the Earth). The increase of temperature with altitude is a result of the absorption of the Sun&#x27;s ultraviolet (UV) radiation by the ozone layer, where ozone is exothermically photolyzed into oxygen in a cyclical fashion. This temperature inversion is in contrast to the troposphere, where temperature decreases with altitude, and between the troposphere and stratosphere is the tropopause border that demarcates the beginning of the temperature inversion.

Near the equator, the lower edge of the stratosphere is as high as , at mid-latitudes around , and at the poles about . Temperatures range from an average of near the tropopause to an average of near the mesosphere. Stratospheric temperatures also vary within the stratosphere as the seasons change, reaching particularly low temperatures in the polar night (winter). Winds in the stratosphere can far exceed those in the troposphere, reaching near in the Southern polar vortex.

== Discovery ==
In 1902, Léon Teisserenc de Bort from France and Richard Assmann from Germany, in separate but coordinated publications and following years of observations, published the discovery of an isothermal layer at around 11–14  km (6.8-8.7  mi), which is the base of the lower stratosphere. This was based on temperature profiles from mostly unmanned and a few manned instrumented balloons.

== Ozone layer ==
The mechanism describing the formation of the ozone layer was described by British mathematician and geophysicist Sydney Chapman in 1930, and is known as the Chapman cycle or ozone–oxygen cycle. Molecular oxygen absorbs high energy sunlight in the UV-C region, at wavelengths shorter than about 240 nm. Radicals produced from the homolytically split oxygen molecules combine with molecular oxygen to form ozone. Ozone in turn is photolyzed much more rapidly than molecular oxygen as it has a stronger absorption that occurs at longer wavelengths, where the solar emission is more intense. Ozone (O3) photolysis produces O and O2. The oxygen atom product combines with atmospheric molecular oxygen to reform O3, releasing heat. The rapid photolysis and reformation of ozone heat the stratosphere, resulting in a temperature inversion. This increase of temperature with altitude is characteristic of the stratosphere; its resistance to vertical mixing means that it is stratified. Within the stratosphere temperatures increase with altitude &quot;(see temperature inversion)&quot;; the top of the stratosphere has a temperature of about 270 K (−3°C or 26.6°F).

This vertical stratification, with warmer layers above and cooler layers below, makes the stratosphere dynamically stable: there is no regular convection and associated turbulence in this part of the atmosphere. However, exceptionally energetic convection processes, such as volcanic eruption columns and overshooting tops in severe supercell thunderstorms, may carry convection into the stratosphere on a very local and temporary basis. Overall, the attenuation of solar UV at wavelengths that damage DNA by the ozone layer allows life to exist on the planet&#x27;s surface outside of the ocean. All air entering the stratosphere must pass through the tropopause, the temperature minimum that divides the troposphere and stratosphere. The rising air is literally freeze-dried; the stratosphere is a very dry place. The top of the stratosphere is called the stratopause, above which the temperature decreases with height.

=== Formation and destruction ===

Sydney Chapman gave a correct description of the source of stratospheric ozone and its ability to generate heat within the stratosphere; he also wrote that ozone may be destroyed by reacting with atomic oxygen, making two molecules of molecular oxygen. We now know that there are additional ozone loss mechanisms and that these mechanisms are catalytic, meaning that a small amount of the catalyst can destroy a great number of ozone molecules. The first is due to the reaction of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) with ozone. •OH is formed by the reaction of electrically excited oxygen atoms produced by ozone photolysis, with water vapor. While the stratosphere is dry, additional water vapour is produced in situ by the photochemical oxidation of methane (CH4). The HO2 radical produced by the reaction of OH with O3 is recycled to OH by reaction with oxygen atoms or ozone. In addition, solar proton events can significantly affect ozone levels via radiolysis with the subsequent formation of OH. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is produced by biological activity at the surface and is oxidized to NO in the stratosphere; the so-called NOx radical cycles also deplete stratospheric ozone. Finally, chlorofluorocarbon molecules are photolyzed in the stratosphere releasing chlorine atoms that react with ozone giving ClO and O2. The chlorine atoms are recycled when ClO reacts with O in the upper stratosphere, or when ClO reacts with itself in the chemistry of the Antarctic ozone hole.

Paul J. Crutzen, Mario J. Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1995 for their work describing the formation and decomposition of stratospheric ozone.

== Aircraft flight ==

Commercial airliners typically cruise at altitudes of which is in the lower reaches of the stratosphere in temperate latitudes. This optimizes fuel efficiency, mostly due to the low temperatures encountered near the tropopause and low air density, reducing parasitic drag on the airframe. Stated another way, it allows the airliner to fly faster while maintaining lift equal to the weight of the plane. (The fuel consumption depends on the drag, which is related to the lift by the lift-to-drag ratio.) It also allows the airplane to stay above the turbulent weather of the troposphere.

The Concorde aircraft cruised at Mach 2 at about , and the SR-71 cruised at Mach 3 at , all within the stratosphere.

Because the temperature in the tropopause and lower stratosphere is largely constant with increasing altitude, very little convection and its resultant turbulence occurs there. Most turbulence at this altitude is caused by variations in the jet stream and other local wind shears, although areas of significant convective activity (thunderstorms) in the troposphere below may produce turbulence as a result of convective overshoot.

On October 24, 2014, Alan Eustace became the record holder for reaching the altitude record for a manned balloon at . Eustace also broke the world records for vertical speed skydiving, reached with a peak velocity of 1,321  km/h (822  mph) and total freefall distance of – lasting four minutes and 27 seconds.

== Circulation and mixing ==
The stratosphere is a region of intense interactions among radiative, dynamical, and chemical processes, in which the horizontal mixing of gaseous components proceeds much more rapidly than does vertical mixing. The overall circulation of the stratosphere is termed as Brewer-Dobson circulation, which is a single-celled circulation, spanning from the tropics up to the poles, consisting of the tropical upwelling of air from the tropical troposphere and the extra-tropical downwelling of air. Stratospheric circulation is a predominantly wave-driven circulation in that the tropical upwelling is induced by the wave force by the westward propagating Rossby waves, in a phenomenon called Rossby-wave pumping.

An interesting feature of stratospheric circulation is the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in the tropical latitudes, which is driven by gravity waves that are convectively generated in the troposphere. The QBO induces a secondary circulation that is important for the global stratospheric transport of tracers, such as ozone or water vapor.

Another large-scale feature that significantly influences stratospheric circulation is the breaking planetary waves resulting in intense quasi-horizontal mixing in the midlatitudes. This breaking is much more pronounced in the winter hemisphere where this region is called the surf zone. This breaking is caused due to a highly non-linear interaction between the vertically propagating planetary waves and the isolated high potential vorticity region known as the polar vortex. The resultant breaking causes large-scale mixing of air and other trace gases throughout the midlatitude surf zone. The timescale of this rapid mixing is much smaller than the much slower timescales of upwelling in the tropics and downwelling in the extratropics.

During northern hemispheric winters, sudden stratospheric warmings, caused by the absorption of Rossby waves in the stratosphere, can be observed in approximately half of the winters when easterly winds develop in the stratosphere. These events often precede unusual winter weather and may even be responsible for the cold European winters of the 1960s.

Stratospheric warming of the polar vortex results in its weakening. When the vortex is strong, it keeps the cold, high-pressure air masses &quot;contained&quot; in the Arctic; when the vortex weakens, air masses move equatorward, and results in rapid changes of weather in the mid latitudes.

==Upper-atmospheric lightning==


Upper-atmospheric lightning is a family of short-lived electrical breakdown phenomena that occur well above the altitudes of normal lightning and storm clouds. Upper-atmospheric lightning is believed to be electrically induced forms of luminous plasma. Lightning extending above the troposphere into the stratosphere is referred to as blue jet, and that reaching into the mesosphere as red sprite.

== Life ==
Bacterial life survives in the stratosphere, making it a part of the biosphere. In 2001, dust was collected at a height of 41 kilometres in a high-altitude balloon experiment and was found to contain bacterial material when examined later in the laboratory.

<doc id="47459" wikidata="Q16311" url="?curid=47459" title="James T. Kirk">
<text>James Tiberius Kirk, often known as Captain Kirk, is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; media franchise. Originally played by Canadian actor William Shatner, Kirk first appeared in &quot;Star Trek&quot; serving aboard the starship USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; as captain. Kirk leads his crew as they explore new worlds and &quot;boldly go where no man has gone before&quot;. Often, the characters of Spock and Leonard &quot;Bones&quot; McCoy act as his logical and emotional sounding boards, respectively. Kirk has also been portrayed in numerous films, books, comics, webisodes, and video games.

Kirk first appears in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;The Man Trap&quot;, broadcast on September 8, 1966, although the first episode recorded featuring Shatner was &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;. Shatner continued in the role for the show&#x27;s three seasons, and he later provided the voice of the animated version of Kirk in &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; (1973–1974). Shatner returned to the role for &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (1979) and six subsequent films.

American actor Chris Pine portrays a young version of the character in the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; (2013), and in &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot; (2016). Paul Wesley portrays Kirk on the Paramount+ series &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot;, set prior to Kirk&#x27;s captaincy of the Enterprise. Other actors have played the character in fan-created media, and the character has been the subject of multiple spoofs and satires.

==Biography==
James Tiberius Kirk was born in Riverside, Iowa, on March 22, 2233, where he was raised by his parents, George and Winona Kirk. Although born on Earth, Kirk lived for a time on Tarsus IV, where he was one of nine surviving witnesses to the massacre of 4,000 colonists by Kodos the Executioner. James Kirk&#x27;s brother, George Samuel Kirk, is first mentioned in &quot;What Are Little Girls Made Of?&quot; and introduced and killed in &quot;Operation -- Annihilate!&quot;, leaving behind three children.

Kirk became the first and only student at Starfleet Academy to defeat the &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; test, garnering a commendation for original thinking after he reprogrammed the computer to make the &quot;no-win scenario&quot; winnable. Kirk was granted a field commission as an ensign and posted to advanced training aboard the USS &quot;Republic&quot;. He was then promoted to lieutenant junior grade and returned to Starfleet Academy as a student instructor. According to a friend, students could either &quot;think or sink&quot; in his class, and Kirk himself was &quot;a stack of books with legs&quot;. Upon graduating in the top five percent, Kirk was promoted to lieutenant and served aboard the USS &quot;Farragut&quot;. While assigned to the &quot;Farragut&quot;, Kirk commanded his first planetary survey and survived a deadly attack by a bizarre cloud-like creature that killed a large portion of the &quot;Farragut&quot;″s crew, including his commanding officer, Captain Garrovick. Although the surviving Executive Officer disagreed, Kirk blamed himself for years for hesitating to fire his assigned weapons upon seeing the threat until a later encounter with the creature showed that firing immediately with conventional weapons would have been useless anyway.

Kirk became Starfleet&#x27;s youngest starship captain after receiving command of the for a five-year mission, three years of which are depicted in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series. Kirk&#x27;s most significant relationships in the television series are with first officer Spock and chief medical officer Dr. Leonard &quot;Bones&quot; McCoy. McCoy is someone to whom Kirk unburdens himself and is a foil to Spock. Robert Jewett and John Shelton Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;The Myth of the American Superhero&quot; describes Kirk as &quot;a hard-driving leader who pushes himself and his crew beyond human limits&quot;. Terry J. Erdman and Paula M. Block, in their &quot;Star Trek 101&quot; primer, note that while &quot;cunning, courageous and confident&quot;, Kirk also has a &quot;tendency to ignore Starfleet regulations when he feels the end justifies the means&quot;; he is &quot;the quintessential officer, a man among men and a hero for the ages&quot;. Although Kirk throughout the series becomes romantically involved with various women, when confronted with a choice between a woman and the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, &quot;his ship always won&quot;.

Roddenberry wrote in a production memo that Kirk is not afraid of being fallible, but rather is afraid of the consequences to his ship and crew should he make an error in judgment. Roddenberry wrote:

In &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, Admiral Kirk is Chief of Starfleet Operations, and he takes command of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; from Captain Willard Decker. &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s novelization of &quot;The Motion Picture&quot; depicts Kirk married to a Starfleet officer killed during a transporter accident. At the beginning of &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, Kirk takes command of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; from Captain Spock to pursue his enemy from &quot;Space Seed&quot;, Khan Noonien Singh. The movie introduces Kirk&#x27;s former lover Carol and his son, David Marcus. Spock, who notes that &quot;commanding a starship is [Kirk&#x27;s] first, best destiny&quot;, dies at the end of &quot;Star Trek II&quot;. In &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;, Admiral Kirk leads his surviving officers in a successful mission to rescue Spock from a planet on which he is reborn. Although Kirk is demoted to Captain in &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; for disobeying Starfleet orders, he also receives command of the new &quot;Enterprise&quot;, the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-A (NCC 1701-A). 

In &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;, Captain Jean-Luc Picard finds Kirk living in the timeless Nexus, despite the fact that history recorded his death during the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-B&#x27;s maiden voyage, Kirk having fallen into the Nexus in the incident that caused his &quot;death&quot;. Picard persuades Kirk to return to Picard&#x27;s present to help stop the villain Soran from destroying Veridian III&#x27;s sun. Although Kirk initially refuses the offer, he agrees after realizing the Nexus cannot give him the one thing he has always sought: the ability to make a difference. The two leave the Nexus and stop Soran. However, Kirk is mortally wounded; as he dies, Picard assures him that he helped to &quot;make a difference&quot;. Picard buries Kirk on the planet, however in &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;&#x27;s third season (2023), Kirk’s body is revealed to be stored in stasis at the Daystrom Institute by Section 31.

===Shatnerverse===
Shatner has since written a series of novels featuring Kirk being brought back to life by a Borg-Romulan alliance to serve as an assassin against Picard, but he is restored to normal and returns to provisional active service in Starfleet, including opposing his Mirror Universe counterpart.

===Kelvin Timeline===

In this series, Chris Pine plays Kirk.

The series takes place in an alternate course of events known as the &quot;Kelvin Timeline&quot; that reveal different origins for Kirk, the formation of his association with Spock, and how they came to serve together on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Whereas &quot;The Original Series&quot; portrayed Kirk as having been born in Iowa, the &quot;Star Trek&quot; film portrays him being born on a shuttle escaping the starship USS &quot;Kelvin&quot; in an alternate timeline in which his father is killed when the &quot;Kelvin&quot; is attacked by a Romulan ship from the future. In the film, George and Winona Kirk name their son &quot;James Tiberius&quot; after his maternal and paternal grandfathers, respectively.

Although the film treats specific details from Star Trek as mutable, characterizations are meant to &quot;remain the same&quot; though with Kirk being initially portrayed as &quot;a reckless, bar-fighting rebel&quot; but who eventually matures. According to Pine, the character is &quot;a 25-year-old [who acts like a] 15-year-old&quot; and who is &quot;angry at the world&quot;, until he enrolls in Starfleet Academy basically after being &#x27;dared&#x27; by Captain Christopher Pike.

Kirk and Spock clash at Starfleet Academy, but, over the course of the film, Kirk focuses his &quot;passion and obstinance and the spectrum of emotions&quot; and becomes captain of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. He is also aided by a meeting with the time-displaced Spock of the original timeline, who inspires Kirk to live up to his full potential after learning about the parallel version of himself and his accomplishments as Captain in the elder Spock&#x27;s timeline.

==Development==
===Conception and television===

Jeffrey Hunter played the commanding officer of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Captain Christopher Pike, in the rejected &quot;Star Trek&quot; television pilot &quot;The Cage&quot;. In developing a new pilot episode, called &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;, series creator Gene Roddenberry changed the captain&#x27;s name to &quot;James Kirk&quot; after rejecting other options like Hannibal, Timber, Flagg and Raintree. The episode title may have been inspired by Captain James Cook, whose journal entry &quot;ambition leads me ... farther than any other man has been before me&quot; inspired the episode title, and became the series catch-phrase in the opening voice-over. The character is in part based on C. S. Forester&#x27;s Horatio Hornblower hero, and NBC wanted the show to emphasize the captain&#x27;s &quot;rugged individualism&quot;. Roddenberry had previously used the middle name of Tiberius for the leading character in his earlier television series, &quot;The Lieutenant&quot;, which was to feature several actors who would later go on to be part of the production of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

Jack Lord was Desilu Productions&#x27; original choice to play Kirk, but his demand for fifty-percent ownership of the show led to him not being hired. The second pilot episode was successful, and &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; was broadcast as the third episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot; on September 22, 1966.

William Shatner tried to imbue the character with qualities of &quot;awe and wonder&quot; absent from &quot;The Cage&quot;. He also drew upon his experiences as a Shakespearean actor to invigorate the character, whose dialogue at times is laden with jargon. Not only did Shatner take inspiration from Roddenberry&#x27;s suggestion of Hornblower, but also from Alexander the Great – &quot;the athlete and the intellectual of his time&quot; – whom Shatner had played for an unsold television pilot two years earlier. In addition, the actor based Kirk partly on himself because &quot;the fatigue factor [after weeks of daily filming] is such that you try to be as honest about yourself as possible&quot;. A comedy veteran, Shatner suggested making the show&#x27;s characters as comfortable working in space as they would be at sea, thus having Kirk be a humorous &quot;good-pal-the-captain, who in time of need would snap to and become the warrior&quot;. Changing the character to be &quot;a man with very human emotions&quot; also allowed for the development of the Spock character. Shatner wrote that &quot;Kirk was a man who marveled and greatly appreciated the endless surprises presented to him by the universe ... He didn&#x27;t take things for granted and, more than anything else, respected life in every one of its weird weekly adventure forms&quot;.

===Films===
Shatner did not expect &quot;Star Trek&quot; to be successful, so when it was cancelled in 1969, he assumed it would be the end of his association with the franchise. Following &quot;Star Trek&#x27;s&quot; popularity after its cancelation, Shatner went on to voice Kirk in the animated &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, star in the first seven &quot;Star Trek&quot; films, and provide voice acting for several games. &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; director and writer Nicholas Meyer, who had never seen an episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot; before he was assigned to direct, conceived a &quot;&quot;Hornblower&quot; in outer space&quot; atmosphere, unaware that those books had been an influence on the show. Meyer also emphasized parallels to Sherlock Holmes, in that both characters waste away in the absence of stimuli: new cases for Holmes; starship adventures for Kirk.

Meyer&#x27;s &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; script focuses on Kirk&#x27;s age, with McCoy giving him a pair of glasses as a birthday present. The script states that Kirk is 49, but Shatner was unsure about being specific about Kirk&#x27;s age because he was hesitant to portray a middle-aged version of himself. Shatner changed his mind when producer Harve Bennett convinced Shatner that he could age gracefully like Spencer Tracy. Spock&#x27;s sacrifice at the end of the film allows for Kirk&#x27;s spiritual rebirth; after commenting earlier that he feels old and worn out, Kirk states in the final scene that he feels &quot;young.&quot; Additionally, Spock&#x27;s self-sacrificing solution to the no-win &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; scenario, which Kirk had cheated his way through, forces Kirk to confront death and to grow as a character.

Both Shatner and test audiences were dissatisfied that Kirk was fatally shot in the back in the original ending of the film &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;. An addendum inserted while Shatner&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek Movie Memories&quot; memoir was being printed expresses his enthusiasm at being called back to film a rewritten ending. Despite the rewrite, &quot;Generations&quot; co-writer Ronald D. Moore said that Kirk&#x27;s death, which was intended to &quot;resonate throughout the Star Trek franchise&quot;, failed to &quot;pay off the themes [of death and mortality] in the way we wanted&quot;. Malcolm McDowell, whose character kills Kirk, was dissatisfied with both versions of Kirk&#x27;s death: he believed Kirk should have been killed &quot;in a big way&quot;. McDowell claims to have received death threats after &quot;Generations&quot; was released.

===Franchise &quot;reboot&quot;===

In &quot;Star Trek&quot; (2009), screenwriters Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci focused their story on Kirk and Spock in the movie&#x27;s alternative timeline while attempting to preserve key character traits from the previous depictions. Kurtzman said casting someone whose portrayal of Kirk would show that the character &quot;is being honored and protected&quot; was &quot;tricky&quot;, but that the &quot;spirit of Kirk is very much alive and well&quot; in Pine&#x27;s depiction. Due to his belief that he could not take himself seriously as a leader, Pine recalled having difficulty with his audition, which required him &quot;to bark ″&quot;Trek&quot; jargon&#x27;&quot;, but his charisma impressed director J. J. Abrams. Pine&#x27;s chemistry with Zachary Quinto, playing Spock, led Abrams to offer Pine the role. Jimmy Bennett played Kirk in scenes depicting the character&#x27;s childhood. The writers turned to material from the novel &quot;Best Destiny&quot; for inspiration as to Kirk&#x27;s childhood.

In preparing to play Kirk, Pine decided to embrace the character&#x27;s key traits – &quot;charming, funny, leader of men&quot; – rather than try to fit the &quot;predigested image&quot; of Shatner&#x27;s portrayal. Pine specifically did not try to mirror Shatner&#x27;s cadence, believing that doing so would become &quot;an impersonation&quot;. Pine said he wanted his portrayal of Kirk to most resemble Harrison Ford&#x27;s Indiana Jones or Han Solo characters, highlighting their humor and &quot;accidental hero&quot; traits.

A misunderstanding arose during the film&#x27;s production about the possibility of Shatner making a cameo appearance. According to Abrams, the production team considered ways to resurrect Shatner&#x27;s deceased Kirk character, but could not devise a way that was not &quot;lame&quot;. However, Abrams believed Shatner misinterpreted language about trying to get &quot;him&quot; into the movie as a reference to Shatner, and not his character. Shatner released a YouTube video expressing disappointment at not being approached for a cameo. Although Shatner questioned the wisdom of not including him in the film, he predicted the movie would be &quot;wonderful&quot; and that he was &quot;kidding&quot; about Abrams not offering him a cameo.

=== &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot; ===

Kirk also appears in &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot;, which is set six years before the events of the original series. He first appears in the final episode of Season 1, portrayed by Paul Wesley, and appeared as a recurring guest in Season 2. In this series, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; has another captain, Kirk&#x27;s predecessor Christopher Pike, who first appeared in &quot;The Cage&quot;.

==Reception==
According to Shatner, early &quot;Star Trek&quot; reviewers described his performance as &quot;wooden&quot;, with most of the show&#x27;s acting praise and media interest going to Nimoy. However, Shatner&#x27;s mannerisms when portraying Kirk have become &quot;instantly recognizable&quot; and Shatner won a Saturn Award for Best Actor in 1982 for &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;. &quot;Star Trek II&quot; director Nicholas Meyer said Shatner &quot;gives the best performance of his life&quot; in &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; called Pine&#x27;s performance of Kirk an &quot;unqualified success&quot;, and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; said Pine is &quot;a fine, brash boy Kirk&quot;. &quot;Slate&quot;, which called Pine &quot;a jewel&quot;, described his performance as &quot;channel[ing]&quot; Shatner without being an impersonation.

&quot;Slate&quot; described Shatner&#x27;s depiction of Kirk as an &quot;expansive, randy, faintly ridiculous, and yet supremely capable leader of men, Falstaffian in his love of life and largeness of spirit&quot;. &quot;The Myth of the American Superhero&quot; refers to Kirk as a &quot;superhuman redeemer&quot; who &quot;like a true superhero ... regularly escapes after risking battle with monsters or enemy spaceships&quot;. Although some episodes question Kirk&#x27;s position as a hero, &quot;Star Trek&quot; &quot;never left the viewer in doubt for long&quot;. Others have commented that Kirk&#x27;s exaggerated &quot;strength, intelligence, charm, and adventurousness&quot; make him unrealistic. Kirk is described as able to find ways &quot;through unanticipated problems to reach [his] goals&quot; and his leadership style is most &quot;appropriate in a tight, geographically identical team with a culture of strong leadership.&quot; Although Roddenberry conceived the character as being &quot;in a very real sense ... &#x27;married&#x27; &quot; to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Kirk has been noted for &quot;his sexual exploits with gorgeous females of every size, shape and type&quot;; he has been called &quot;promiscuous&quot; and labeled a &quot;womanizer&quot;. &quot;The Last Lecture&quot; author Randy Pausch believed he became a better teacher, colleague, and husband because he watched Kirk run the &quot;Enterprise&quot;; Pausch wrote that &quot;for ambitious boys with a scientific bent, there could be no greater role model than James T. Kirk&quot;. David A. Goodman commented that Kirk &quot;has as much reality as possible for a fictional character.&quot;

In 2012, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked the character Captain Kirk, as depicted in the original series, films, and the new Kirk in 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot;, as the number one top character of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. In 2016, Kirk was ranked as the #1 most important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe by &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, out of 100 characters of the franchise.

In 2018, &quot;CBR&quot; ranked Kirk the best Starfleet character of &quot;Star Trek,&quot; including later television series.

In July 2019, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked Kirk the 8th smartest character of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

In 1985, Riverside, Iowa petitioned Roddenberry and Paramount Pictures for permission to &quot;adopt&quot; Kirk as their town&#x27;s &quot;Future Son&quot;. Shatner and Roddenberry approved the proposal. Paramount wanted $40,000 for a license to reproduce a bust of Kirk, but the city instead set a plaque and built a replica of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; (named the &quot;USS &quot;Riverside&quot;&quot;), and the Riverside Area Community Club holds an annual &quot;Trek Fest&quot; in anticipation of Kirk&#x27;s birthday.

Kirk has been the subject of a wide range of television spoofs that aired in many countries, including &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; and KI.KA&#x27;s &quot;Bernd das Brot&quot;. John Belushi&#x27;s impression of Kirk for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, which he described as his favorite role, was &quot;dead-on&quot;. Jim Carrey has been praised for his satire of the character in a 1992 episode of &quot;In Living Color&quot;. Comedian Kevin Pollak is well known for his impressions of Shatner as Kirk.

Kirk&#x27;s memorable scream of &quot;Khan!&quot; in the 1982 movie &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; has become a pop culture icon in its own right, spawning internet memes and is widely parodied and paid tribute to.

Kirk has been referenced in the lyrics of many pop songs. Early examples include the 1979 song &quot;Where&#x27;s Captain Kirk?&quot; by Spizzenergi, the 1982 rap song &quot;Tough&quot; by Kurtis Blow, and 1983&#x27;s &quot;99 Luftballons&quot; by Nena (both German and English versions). More recently, in the 2003 remix of 1998’s &quot;That Don&#x27;t Impress Me Much&quot;, Shania Twain puts forth Captain Kirk as one of the unattainable ideals to whom her unappealingly haughty suitor apparently thinks himself equal.

Kirk has been merchandised in a variety of ways, including collectible busts, action figures, mugs, t-shirts, and Christmas tree ornaments. A Kirk Halloween mask was altered and used as the mask worn by the character Michael Myers in the &quot;Halloween&quot; film franchise. In 2002, Kirk&#x27;s captain&#x27;s chair from the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; was auctioned for $304,000.

In a 2010 Space Foundation survey, Kirk tied with cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin as the No. 6 most popular space hero.

Captain Kirk has also been portrayed in feline form. First, anthropomorphically, in two episodes of the 1975 Filmation Saturday morning animated children’s series &quot;The Secret Lives of Waldo Kitty&quot;. The cartoon is based around the title character’s fantasies about being various heroic felines based on popular culture icons. Later came scientific illustrator Jenny Parks&#x27; 2017 book &quot;Star Trek Cats&quot;, in which Kirk is depicted as an orange tabby cat.

The Kirk crater on Pluto&#x27;s moon, Charon, is named after the character.

===Fan productions===
In addition to television, feature films, books, and parodies, Kirk has also been portrayed in non-canon fan fiction.

====&quot;Star Trek: New Voyages&quot;====
The &quot;Star Trek: New Voyages&quot; fan production, known from 2008 until 2015 as &quot;Star Trek: Phase II&quot;, portrays the further voyages of the original &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew. The series&#x27; creators feel that &quot;Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the rest should be treated as &#x27;classic&#x27; characters like Willy Loman from &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, Gandalf from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; or even Hamlet, Othello or Romeo. Many actors have and can play the roles, each offering a different interpretation of said character.&quot;

James Cawley played Kirk in most of the ten episode &quot;Phase II&quot; series from its beginning in 2004 before replacing himself with actor Brian Gross. &quot;Wired&quot; observes that while Cawley&#x27;s depiction &quot;lacks Shatner&#x27;s vulnerability&quot;, the actor has enough swagger &quot;to be passable in the role&quot;. Cawley&#x27;s portrayal was well-known enough at Paramount that a group of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; writers called for Cawley&#x27;s attention at a science fiction convention by shouting &quot;Hey, Kirk!&quot; at him while Shatner sat nearby.

====&quot;Star Trek Continues&quot;====
First produced in 2013, the 11 episode series &quot;Star Trek Continues&quot; also looked to chronicle the &quot;lost seasons&quot; of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;. The series developer and producer is anime voice actor Vic Mignogna, who also plays the role of Kirk. Rounding out the core cast is fellow voice actor Todd Haberkorn as Spock, Chris Doohan (son of the original Scotty actor James Doohan) as Scotty, and as McCoy first author-producer Larry Nemecek, followed by voice actor Chuck Huber. It also co-starred Grant Imahara (&quot;MythBusters&quot;) as Sulu.

The first episode, &quot;Pilgrim of Eternity&quot; (with Michael Forest reprising his role as Apollo from the original series episode &quot;Who Mourns for Adonais?&quot;) was released in 2013. The second episode, &quot;Lolani&quot; (featuring guest star Lou Ferrigno), was released in February 2014, and a third episode, &quot;Fairest of Them All&quot; was released in June 2014 and won a Burbank International Film Festival award for &quot;Best New Media – Drama&quot;. &quot;Star Trek Continues&quot; also won a Geekie Award for &quot;Best Web Series&quot;. On June 19, 2015, Episode 4 of the series was posted and titled &quot;White Iris&quot;. All eleven full episodes have been released as of December, 2017.

==Legacy==
In October 2021, Kirk&#x27;s actor from &quot;The Original Series&quot; William Shatner flew to space aboard a Blue Origin sub-orbital capsule. At age 90, he became the oldest person to fly to space and one of the first 600 to do so.

<doc id="47460" wikidata="Q162167" url="?curid=47460" title="Mesosphere">
<text>The mesosphere (; ) is the third layer of the atmosphere, directly above the stratosphere and directly below the thermosphere. In the mesosphere, temperature decreases as altitude increases. This characteristic is used to define limits: it begins at the top of the stratosphere (sometimes called the stratopause), and ends at the mesopause, which is the coldest part of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, with temperatures below . The exact upper and lower boundaries of the mesosphere vary with latitude and with season (higher in winter and at the tropics, lower in summer and at the poles), but the lower boundary is usually located at altitudes from above sea level, and the upper boundary (the mesopause) is usually from .

The stratosphere and mesosphere are sometimes collectively referred to as the &quot;middle atmosphere&quot;, which spans altitudes approximately between above Earth&#x27;s surface. The mesopause, at an altitude of , separates the mesosphere from the thermosphere—the second-outermost layer of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. On Earth, the mesopause nearly co-incides with the turbopause, below which different chemical species are well-mixed due to turbulent eddies. Above this level the atmosphere becomes non-uniform because the scale heights of different chemical species differ according to their molecular masses.

The term near space is also sometimes used to refer to altitudes within the mesosphere. This term does not have a technical definition, but typically refers to the region roughly between the Armstrong limit (about 62,000 ft or 19 km, above which humans require a pressure suit in order to survive) and the Kármán line (where astrodynamics must take over from aerodynamics in order to achieve flight); or, by another definition, to the space between the highest altitude commercial airliners fly at (about 40,000 ft (12.2 km)) and the lowest perigee of satellites being able to orbit the Earth (about 45 mi (73 km)). Some sources distinguish between the terms &quot;near space&quot; and &quot;upper atmosphere&quot;, so that only the layers closest to the Kármán line are described as &quot;near space&quot;.

==Temperature==
Within the mesosphere, temperature decreases with increasing height. This is a result of decreasing absorption of solar radiation by the rarefied atmosphere having a diminishing relative ozone concentration as altitude increases (ozone being the main absorber in the UV wavelengths that survived absorption by the thermosphere). Additionally, this is also a result of increasing cooling by CO2 radiative emission. The top of the mesosphere, called the mesopause, is the coldest part of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Temperatures in the upper mesosphere fall as low as about , varying according to latitude and season.

==Dynamic features==

The main most important features in this region are strong zonal (East-West) winds, atmospheric tides, internal atmospheric gravity waves (commonly called &quot;gravity waves&quot;), and planetary waves. Most of these tides and waves start in the troposphere and lower stratosphere, and propagate to the mesosphere. In the mesosphere, gravity-wave amplitudes can become so large that the waves become unstable and dissipate. This dissipation deposits momentum into the mesosphere and largely drives global circulation.

Noctilucent clouds are located in the mesosphere. The upper mesosphere is also the region of the ionosphere known as the &quot;D layer&quot;, which is only present during the day when some ionization occurs with nitric oxide being ionized by Lyman series-alpha hydrogen radiation. The ionization is so weak that when night falls, and the source of ionization is removed, the free electron and ion form back into a neutral molecule.

A deep sodium layer is located between . Made of unbound, non-ionized atoms of sodium, the sodium layer radiates weakly to contribute to the airglow. The sodium has an average concentration of 400,000 atoms per cubic centimetre. This band is regularly replenished by sodium sublimating from incoming meteors. Astronomers have begun utilizing this sodium band to create &quot;guide stars&quot; as part of the adaptive optical correction process used to produce ultra-sharp ground-based observations. Other metal layers, e.g. iron and potassium, exist in the upper mesosphere/lower thermosphere region as well.

Beginning in October 2018, a distinct type of aurora has been identified, originating in the mesosphere. Often referred to as &#x27;dunes&#x27; due to their resemblance to sandy ripples on a beach, the green undulating lights extend toward the equator. They have been identified as originating about above the surface. Since auroras are caused by ultra-high-speed solar particles interacting with atmospheric molecules, the green color of these dunes has tentatively been explained by the interaction of those solar particles with oxygen molecules. The dunes therefore occur where mesospheric oxygen is more concentrated.

Millions of meteors enter the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, averaging 40,000 tons per year. The ablated material, called meteoric smoke, is thought to serve as condensation nuclei for noctilucent clouds.

==Exploration==
The mesosphere lies above altitude records for aircraft, while only the lowest few kilometers are accessible to balloons, for which the altitude record is . Meanwhile, the mesosphere is below the minimum altitude for orbital spacecraft due to high atmospheric drag. It has only been accessed through the use of sounding rockets, which are only capable of taking mesospheric measurements for a few minutes per mission. As a result, it is the least-understood part of the atmosphere, resulting in the humorous moniker &quot;ignorosphere&quot;. The presence of red sprites and blue jets (electrical discharges or lightning within the lower mesosphere), noctilucent clouds, and density shears within this poorly understood layer are of current scientific interest.

On February 1, 2003, broke up on reentry at about altitude, in the lower mesosphere, killing all seven crew members.

<doc id="47463" wikidata="Q178043" url="?curid=47463" title="Thermosphere">
<text>The thermosphere is the layer in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere directly above the mesosphere and below the exosphere. Within this layer of the atmosphere, ultraviolet radiation causes photoionization/photodissociation of molecules, creating ions; the thermosphere thus constitutes the larger part of the ionosphere. Taking its name from the Greek θερμός (pronounced &quot;thermos&quot;) meaning heat, the thermosphere begins at about 80 km (50 mi) above sea level. At these high altitudes, the residual atmospheric gases sort into strata according to molecular mass (see turbosphere). Thermospheric temperatures increase with altitude due to absorption of highly energetic solar radiation. Temperatures are highly dependent on solar activity, and can rise to or more. Radiation causes the atmospheric particles in this layer to become electrically charged, enabling radio waves to be refracted and thus be received beyond the horizon. In the exosphere, beginning at about 600 km (375 mi) above sea level, the atmosphere turns into space, although, by the judging criteria set for the definition of the Kármán line (100 km), most of the thermosphere is part of space. The border between the thermosphere and exosphere is known as the thermopause.

The highly attenuated gas in this layer can reach . Despite the high temperature, an observer or object will experience low temperatures in the thermosphere, because the extremely low density of the gas (practically a hard vacuum) is insufficient for the molecules to conduct heat. A normal thermometer will read significantly below , at least at night, because the energy lost by thermal radiation would exceed the energy acquired from the atmospheric gas by direct contact. In the anacoustic zone above , the density is so low that molecular interactions are too infrequent to permit the transmission of sound. 
The dynamics of the thermosphere are dominated by atmospheric tides, which are driven predominantly by diurnal heating. Atmospheric waves dissipate above this level because of collisions between the neutral gas and the ionospheric plasma.

The thermosphere is uninhabited with the exception of the International Space Station, which orbits the Earth within the middle of the thermosphere between and the Tiangong space station, which orbits between .

==Neutral gas constituents==
It is convenient to separate the atmospheric regions according to the two temperature minima at an altitude of about (the tropopause) and at about (the mesopause) (Figure 1). The thermosphere (or the upper atmosphere) is the height region above , while the region between the tropopause and the mesopause is the middle atmosphere (stratosphere and mesosphere) where absorption of solar UV radiation generates the temperature maximum near an altitude of and causes the ozone layer.
The density of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere decreases nearly exponentially with altitude. The total mass of the atmosphere is M = ρA H  ≃ 1 kg/cm2 within a column of one square centimeter above the ground (with ρA = 1.29 kg/m3 the atmospheric density on the ground at z = 0 m altitude, and H ≃ 8 km the average atmospheric scale height). Eighty percent of that mass is concentrated within the troposphere. The mass of the thermosphere above about is only 0.002% of the total mass. Therefore, no significant energetic feedback from the thermosphere to the lower atmospheric regions can be expected.

Turbulence causes the air within the lower atmospheric regions below the turbopause at about to be a mixture of gases that does not change its composition. Its mean molecular weight is 29 g/mol with molecular oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2) as the two dominant constituents. Above the turbopause, however, diffusive separation of the various constituents is significant, so that each constituent follows its barometric height structure with a scale height inversely proportional to its molecular weight. The lighter constituents atomic oxygen (O), helium (He), and hydrogen (H) successively dominate above an altitude of about and vary with geographic location, time, and solar activity. The ratio
N2/O which is a measure of the electron density at the ionospheric F region is highly affected by these variations. These changes follow from the diffusion of the minor constituents through the major gas component during dynamic processes.

The thermosphere contains an appreciable concentration of elemental sodium located in a thick band that occurs at the edge of the mesosphere, above Earth&#x27;s surface. The sodium has an average concentration of 400,000 atoms per cubic centimeter. This band is regularly replenished by sodium sublimating from incoming meteors. Astronomers have begun using this sodium band to create &quot;guide stars&quot; as part of the optical correction process in producing ultra-sharp ground-based observations.

==Energy input==

===Energy budget===
The thermospheric temperature can be determined from density observations as well as from direct satellite measurements. The temperature vs. altitude z in Fig. 1 can be simulated by the so-called Bates profile:

(1) formula_1

with T∞ the exospheric temperature above about 400 km altitude, 
To = 355 K, and zo = 120 km reference temperature and height, and s an empirical parameter depending on T∞ and decreasing with T∞. That formula is derived from a simple equation of heat conduction. One estimates a total heat input of qo≃ 0.8 to 1.6 mW/m2 above zo = 120 km altitude. In order to obtain equilibrium conditions, that heat input qo above zo is lost to the lower atmospheric regions by heat conduction.

The exospheric temperature T∞ is a fair measurement of the solar XUV radiation. Since solar radio emission F at 10.7  cm wavelength is a good indicator of solar activity, one can apply the empirical formula for quiet magnetospheric conditions.

(2) formula_2

with T∞ in K, Fo in 10−2 W m−2 Hz−1 (the Covington index) a value of F averaged over several solar cycles. The Covington index varies typically between 70 and 250 during a solar cycle, and never drops below about 50. Thus, T∞ varies between about 740 and 1350 K. During very quiet magnetospheric conditions, the still continuously flowing magnetospheric energy input contributes by about 250  K to the residual temperature of 500  K in eq.(2). The rest of 250  K in eq.(2) can be attributed to atmospheric waves generated within the troposphere and dissipated within the lower thermosphere.

===Solar XUV radiation===
The solar X-ray and extreme ultraviolet radiation (XUV) at wavelengths &lt; 170  nm is almost completely absorbed within the thermosphere. This radiation causes the various ionospheric layers as well as a temperature increase at these heights (Figure 1).
While the solar visible light (380 to 780  nm) is nearly constant with the variability of not more than about 0.1% of the solar constant, the solar XUV radiation is highly variable in time and space. For instance, X-ray bursts associated with solar flares can dramatically increase their intensity over preflare levels by many orders of magnitude over some time of tens of minutes. In the extreme ultraviolet, the Lyman α line at 121.6 nm represents an important source of ionization and dissociation at ionospheric D layer heights. During quiet periods of solar activity, it alone contains more energy than the rest of the XUV spectrum. Quasi-periodic changes of the order of 100% or greater, with periods of 27 days and 11 years, belong to the prominent variations of solar XUV radiation. However, irregular fluctuations over all time scales are present all the time. During the low solar activity, about half of the total energy input into the thermosphere is thought to be solar XUV radiation. That solar XUV energy input occurs only during daytime conditions, maximizing at the equator during equinox.

===Solar wind===
The second source of energy input into the thermosphere is solar wind energy which is transferred to the magnetosphere by mechanisms that are not well understood. One possible way to transfer energy is via a hydrodynamic dynamo process. Solar wind particles penetrate the polar regions of the magnetosphere where the geomagnetic field lines are essentially vertically directed. An electric field is generated, directed from dawn to dusk. Along the last closed geomagnetic field lines with their footpoints within the auroral zones, field-aligned electric currents can flow into the ionospheric dynamo region where they are closed by electric Pedersen and Hall currents. Ohmic losses of the Pedersen currents heat the lower thermosphere (see e.g., Magnetospheric electric convection field). Also, penetration of high energetic particles from the magnetosphere into the auroral regions enhance drastically the electric conductivity, further increasing the electric currents and thus Joule heating. During the quiet magnetospheric activity, the magnetosphere contributes perhaps by a quarter to the thermosphere&#x27;s energy budget. This is about 250  K of the exospheric temperature in eq.(2). During the very large activity, however, this heat input can increase substantially, by a factor of four or more. That solar wind input occurs mainly in the auroral regions during both day and night.

===Atmospheric waves===
Two kinds of large-scale atmospheric waves within the lower atmosphere exist: internal waves with finite vertical wavelengths which can transport wave energy upward, and external waves with infinitely large wavelengths that cannot transport wave energy. Atmospheric gravity waves and most of the atmospheric tides generated within the troposphere belong to the internal waves. Their density amplitudes increase exponentially with height so that at the mesopause these waves become turbulent and their energy is dissipated (similar to breaking of ocean waves at the coast), thus contributing to the heating of the thermosphere by about 250  K in eq.(2). On the other hand, the fundamental diurnal tide labeled (1, −2) which is most efficiently excited by solar irradiance is an external wave and plays only a marginal role within the lower and middle atmosphere. However, at thermospheric altitudes, it becomes the predominant wave. It drives the electric Sq-current within the ionospheric dynamo region between about 100 and 200  km height.

Heating, predominately by tidal waves, occurs mainly at lower and middle latitudes. The variability of this heating depends on the meteorological conditions within the troposphere and middle atmosphere, and may not exceed about 50%.

==Dynamics==

Within the thermosphere above an altitude of about , all atmospheric waves successively become external waves, and no significant vertical wave structure is visible. The atmospheric wave modes degenerate to the spherical functions Pnm with m a meridional wave number and n the zonal wave number (m = 0: zonal mean flow; m = 1: diurnal tides; m = 2: semidiurnal tides; etc.). The thermosphere becomes a damped oscillator system with low-pass filter characteristics. This means that smaller-scale waves (greater numbers of (n,m)) and higher frequencies are suppressed in favor of large-scale waves and lower frequencies. If one considers very quiet magnetospheric disturbances and a constant mean exospheric temperature (averaged over the sphere), the observed temporal and spatial distribution of the exospheric temperature distribution can be described by a sum of spheric functions:

(3) formula_3

Here, it is φ latitude, λ longitude, and t time, ωa the angular frequency of one year, ωd the angular frequency of one solar day, and τ = ωdt + λ the local time. ta = June 21 is the date of northern summer solstice, and τd = 15:00 is the local time of maximum diurnal temperature.

The first term in (3) on the right is the global mean of the exospheric temperature (of the order of 1000  K). The second term [with P20 = 0.5(3 sin2(φ)−1)] represents the heat surplus at lower latitudes and a corresponding heat deficit at higher latitudes (Fig. 2a). A thermal wind system develops with the wind toward the poles in the upper level and winds away from the poles in the lower level. The coefficient ΔT20 ≈ 0.004 is small because Joule heating in the aurora regions compensates that heat surplus even during quiet magnetospheric conditions. During disturbed conditions, however, that term becomes dominant, changing sign so that now heat surplus is transported from the poles to the equator. The third term (with P10 = sin φ) represents heat surplus on the summer hemisphere and is responsible for the transport of excess heat from the summer into the winter hemisphere (Fig. 2b). Its relative amplitude is of the order ΔT10 ≃ 0.13. The fourth term (with P11(φ) = cos φ) is the dominant diurnal wave (the tidal mode (1,−2)). It is responsible for the transport of excess heat from the daytime hemisphere into the nighttime hemisphere (Fig. 2d). Its relative amplitude is ΔT11≃ 0.15, thus on the order of 150 K. Additional terms (e.g., semiannual, semidiurnal terms, and higher-order terms) must be added to eq.(3). However, they are of minor importance. Corresponding sums can be developed for density, pressure, and the various gas constituents.

==Thermospheric storms==
In contrast to solar XUV radiation, magnetospheric disturbances, indicated on the ground by geomagnetic variations, show an unpredictable impulsive character, from short periodic disturbances of the order of hours to long-standing giant storms of several days&#x27; duration. The reaction of the thermosphere to a large magnetospheric storm is called a thermospheric storm. Since the heat input into the thermosphere occurs at high latitudes (mainly into the auroral regions), the heat transport is represented by the term P20 in eq.(3) is reversed. Also, due to the impulsive form of the disturbance, higher-order terms are generated which, however, possess short decay times and thus quickly disappear. The sum of these modes determines the &quot;travel time&quot; of the disturbance to the lower latitudes, and thus the response time of the thermosphere with respect to the magnetospheric disturbance. Important for the development of an ionospheric storm is the increase of the ratio N2/O during a thermospheric storm at middle and higher latitude. An increase of N2 increases the loss process of the ionospheric plasma and causes therefore a decrease of the electron density within the ionospheric F-layer (negative ionospheric storm).

==Climate change==
A contraction of the thermosphere has been observed as a possible result in part due to increased carbon dioxide concentrations, the strongest cooling and contraction occurring in that layer during solar minimum. The most recent contraction in 2008–2009 was the largest such since at least 1967.

==Phenomena in the thermosphere==
ELVES are a type of upper-atmospheric lightning that occur at the lower boundary of the thermosphere. They often appear at above the ground over thunderstorms as a expanding and flat dimly red glow around in diameter that lasts for typically one millisecond. ELVES were first recorded on a Space Shuttle mission off French Guiana on October 7, 1990.

ELVES is a whimsical acronym for &quot;emissions of light and very low frequency perturbations due to electromagnetic pulse sources.&quot; This refers to the process by which the light is generated; the excitation of nitrogen molecules due to electron collisions (the electrons possibly having been energized by the electromagnetic pulse caused by a discharge from an underlying thunderstorm).

<doc id="47465" wikidata="Q130227" url="?curid=47465" title="Aten">
<text>Aten, also Aton, Atonu, or Itn (, reconstructed ) was the focus of Atenism, the religious system formally established in ancient Egypt by the late Eighteenth Dynasty pharaoh Akhenaten. Exact dating for the Eighteenth Dynasty is contested, though a general date range places the dynasty in the years 1550 to 1292 BCE. The worship of Aten and the coinciding rule of Akhenaten are major identifying characteristics of a period within the Eighteenth Dynasty referred to as the Amarna Period (1336 BCE).

Atenism and the worship of the Aten as the sole god of ancient Egypt state worship did not persist beyond Akhenaten&#x27;s death. Not long after his death, one of Akhenaten&#x27;s Eighteenth Dynasty successors, Tutankhamun, reopened the state temples to other Egyptian gods and re-positioned Amun as the pre-eminent solar deity. Aten is depicted as a solar disc emitting rays terminating in human hands.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;Aten&quot; appears in the Old Kingdom as a noun meaning &quot;disc&quot; which referred to anything flat and circular; the sun was called the &quot;disc of the day&quot; where Ra was thought to reside. By analogy, the term &quot;silver aten&quot; was sometimes used to refer to the moon. High relief and low relief illustrations of the Aten show it with a curved surface, therefore, the late scholar Hugh Nibley insisted that a more correct translation would be globe, orb or sphere, rather than disk.

== Origins ==
The Aten was the disc of the sun and originally an aspect of Ra, the sun god in traditional ancient Egyptian religion. While the Aten was worshiped under the reign of Amenhotep III, it was made the sole deity to receive state and official cult worship under his successor Akhenaten, though archaeological evidence suggests the closing of the state temples of other Egyptian gods likely did not stop household worship of the traditional pantheon. Inscriptions, such as the &quot;Great Hymn to the Aten&quot;, found in temples and tombs during Akhenaten&#x27;s reign showcase the Aten as the creator, giver of life, and nurturing spirit of the world. Aten does not have a creation myth or family but is mentioned in the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;.
The first known reference to Aten the sun-disk as a deity is in &quot;The Story of Sinuhe&quot; from the 12th Dynasty, in which the deceased king is described as rising as a god to the heavens and &quot;uniting with the sun-disk, the divine body merging with its maker&quot;.

== Religion ==
Aten was extensively worshipped as a solar deity during the reign of Amenhotep III where it was depicted as a falcon-headed god like Ra. While Aten was the preeminent creator deity of a pantheon of ancient Egyptian gods under Amenhotep III, it was not until his successor that Aten would be the only god acknowledged via state worship. During the reign of Amenhotep III&#x27;s successor, Amenhotep IV, the Aten became the sole god of the Egyptian state religion, and Amenhotep IV changed his name to Akhenaten to reflect his close link with the supreme deity. The sole worship of Aten can be referred to as Atenism. Many of the core principles of Atenism were recorded in the capital city Akhenaten founded and moved his dynastic government to, Akhetaten, referred to as either Amarna, El-Amarna, or Tell el-Amarna by modern scholars.

In Atenism, night is a time to fear. Work is done best when the sun, and thus Aten, is present. The Aten created all countries and people, and cares for every creature. According to the inscriptions, the Aten created a Nile river in the sky (rain) for the Syrians. The rays of the sun disk only holds out life to the royal family, and because of this non-royals receives life from Akhenaten and Nefertiti, later Neferneferuaten, in exchange for loyalty to the Aten. In inscriptions, like the Hymn to the Aten and the King, the Aten is depicted as caring for the people through Akhenaten, placing the royal family as intermediaries for the worship of the Aten. There is only one known instance of the Aten talking.

In the Hymn to Aten, a love for humanity and the Earth is depicted in Aten&#x27;s mannerisms:

&quot;Aten bends low, near the earth, to watch over his creation; he takes his place in the sky for the same purpose; he wearies himself in the service of the creatures; he shines for them all; he gives them sun and sends them rain. The unborn child and the baby chick are cared for; and Akhenaten asks his divine father to &#x27;lift up&#x27; the creatures for his sake so that they might aspire to the condition of perfection of his father, Aten.&quot;

Akhenaten represented himself as the son of Aten, mirroring many of his predecessors&#x27; claims of divine birth and their positions as the embodiment of Horus. Akhenaten positioned himself as the only intermediary who could speak to Aten, emphasizing the dominance of Aten as the preeminent deity. This has led to discussion of whether Atenism should be considered a monotheistic religion, and thus making it one of the first examples of monotheism.

Aten is both a unique deity and a continuation of the traditional idea of a sun-god in ancient Egyptian religion, deriving a lot of the concepts of power and representation from the earlier solar deities like Ra, but building on top of the power Ra and many of his contemporaries represents. Aten carried absolute power in the universe, representing the life-giving force of light to the world as well as merging with the concept and goddess Ma&#x27;at to develop further responsibilities for Aten beyond the power of light itself.

== Worship ==

The cult-center of the Aten was at the capital city Akhenaten founded, Akhetaten, though other cult sites have been found in Thebes and Heliopolis. The use of Amarna as a capital city and religious center was relatively short lived compared to the 18th Dynasty or New Kingdom as a whole as it was shortly abandoned after the death of Akhenaten. Inscriptions found on boundary stela accredited to Akhenaten discuss his desire to make the city a place of worship to Aten, dedicating the city to the god and emphasizing the royal residences&#x27; efforts in worship. Major principles of the Aten&#x27;s cult worship were recorded via inscriptions on temples and tombs from the period. Straying significantly from the tradition of ancient Egyptian temples being hidden and more enclosed the further one went into the site, temples of Aten were open and did not have roofs in order to allow the rays of the sun inside. No statues of Aten were allowed as they were seen as idolatry. However, these were typically replaced by functionally equivalent representations of Akhenaten and his family venerating the Aten and receiving the ankh, the breath of life, from him. Compared to periods before and after the Amarna Period, Priests had less to do since offerings, such as fruits, flowers, and cakes were limited, and oracles were not needed.

In the worship of the Aten, the daily service of purification, anointment, and clothing of the divine image that is traditionally found in ancient Egyptian worship was not performed. Instead, incense and food-stuff offerings such as meats, wines, and fruits were placed onto open-air altars. A common scene in carved depictions of Akhenaten giving offering to Aten has him consecrating the sacrificed goods with a royal scepter. Instead of barque-processions, the royal family rode in a chariot on festival days. Elite women were known to worship the Aten in sun-shade temples in Akhetaten.

== Iconography ==
Aten was considered to have been everywhere and intangible as Aten was the sunlight and energy in the world. Therefore, he did not have physical representations that other traditional ancient Egyptian gods had, instead represented via the sun disc and reaching rays of light tipped with human-like hands. The explanation as to why the Aten could not be fully represented was that the Aten was beyond creation. Thus the inscriptions of scenes of gods carved in stone previously depicted animals and human forms instead showed the Aten as an orb above with life-giving rays stretching toward the royal figure. This power transcended human or animal form.

Later, iconoclasm was enforced, and even sun disc depictions of Aten were prohibited in an edict issued by Akhenaten. In the edict, he stipulated that Aten&#x27;s name was to be spelt phonetically.

== Architecture ==
Two temples were central to the city of Akhetaten. The larger of the two had an &quot;open, unroofed structure covering an area of about 800 by 300 metres (2,600 ft × 1,000 ft) at the northern end of the city&quot;. Doorways had broken lintels and raised thresholds. Temples to the Aten were open-air structures with little-to-no roofing to maximize the amount of sunlight on the interior making them unique compared to other Egyptian temples of the time. Balustrades depict Akhenaten and the royal family embracing the rays of the Aten flanked stairwells, ramps, and altars. These fragments were initially identified as stele but were later reclassified as balustrades based on the presence of scenes on both sides.

==Royal titulary==
Inscriptions in tombs and temples during the Amarna Period often gave Aten a royal titulary enclosed in a double cartouche. Some have interpreted this to mean that Akhenaten was the embodiment of Aten, and the worship of Aten is directly worship of Akhenaten; but others have taken this as an indicator of Aten as the supreme ruler even over the current reigning royalty.

There were two forms of the title; the first had the names of other gods, and the second later one was more &#x27;singular&#x27; and referred only to the Aten himself. The early form was &quot;Re-Horakhti who rejoices in the Horizon, in his name Shu, which is the Aten.&quot; The later form was &quot;Re, ruler of the two horizons, who rejoices in the Horizon, in his name of light, which is the Aten.&quot;

==Question of monotheism==
Ra-Horus, more usually referred to as Ra-Horakhty (&quot;Ra who is Horus of the two horizons&quot;), is a synthesis of two other gods, both of which are attested from very early on in ancient Egyptian religious practice. During the Amarna Period, this synthesis was seen as the invisible source of energy of the sun god, of which the visible manifestation was the Aten, the solar disk. Thus Ra-Horus-Aten was a development of old ideas which came gradually. The real change, as some see it, was the apparent abandonment of all other gods on the state level, especially Amun-Ra, prohibition of idolatry, and the debatable introduction of quasi-monotheism by Akhenaten. The syncretism is readily apparent in the Great Hymn to the Aten in which Re-Herakhty, Shu, and Aten are merged into the creator god. Others see Akhenaten as a practitioner of an Aten monolatry, as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshipping any but the Aten. Other scholars call the religion henotheistic.

== End of Atenism ==

As pharaoh, Akhenaten was considered the &#x27;high priest&#x27; or even a prophet of the Aten, and during his reign was one of the main propagators of Atenism in Egypt. After the death of Akhenaten, Tutankhamun reinstated the cult of Amun, and the ban on the state worship of non-Atenism deities was lifted in favor of a return to the traditional ancient Egyptian pantheon. The point of this transition can be seen in the name-change of Tutankh&quot;aten&quot; into Tutankh&quot;amun&quot; indicating the loss of favor in the worship of the Aten. While there was no purge of the cult after Akhenaten&#x27;s death, the Aten persisted in Egypt for another ten years or so until it seemed to fade. When Tutankhamun came into power, his religious reign was one of tolerance, with the major difference being that the Aten was no longer the only god worshiped within official, state capacity. Tutankhamun made efforts to rebuild the state temples that were destroyed during Akhenaten&#x27;s reign and reinstate the traditional pantheon of gods. This seemed to be &quot;a move based publicly on the doctrine that Egypt&#x27;s woes stemmed directly from its ignoring the gods, and in turn the gods&#x27; abandonment of Egypt&quot;.

<text>The mesopause is the point of minimum temperature at the boundary between the mesosphere and the thermosphere atmospheric regions. Due to the lack of solar heating and very strong radiative cooling from carbon dioxide, the mesosphere is the coldest region on Earth with temperatures as low as -100 °C (-148 °F or 173 K). The altitude of the mesopause for many years was assumed to be at around 85 km (53 mi), but observations to higher altitudes and modeling studies in the last 10 years have shown that in fact there are two mesopauses - one at about 85 km and a stronger one at about 100 km (62 mi), with a layer of slightly warmer air between them.

Another feature is that the summer mesopause is cooler than the winter (sometimes referred to as the &quot;mesopause anomaly&quot;). It is due to a summer-to-winter circulation giving rise to upwelling at the summer pole and downwelling at the winter pole. Air rising will expand and cool resulting in a cold summer mesopause and conversely downwelling air results in compression and associated increase in temperature at the winter mesopause. In the mesosphere the summer-to-winter circulation is due to gravity wave dissipation, which deposits momentum against the mean east–west flow, resulting in a small north–south circulation.

In recent years the mesopause has also been the focus of studies on global climate change associated with increases in CO2. Unlike the troposphere, where greenhouse gases result in the atmosphere heating up, increased CO2 in the mesosphere acts to cool the atmosphere due to increased radiative emission. This results in a measurable effect - the mesopause should become cooler with increased CO2. Observations do show a decrease of temperature of the mesopause, though the magnitude of this decrease varies and is subject to further study. Modeling studies of this phenomenon have also been carried out.

<text>The Apollo asteroids are a group of near-Earth asteroids named after 1862 Apollo, discovered by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth in the 1930s. They are Earth-crossing asteroids that have an orbital semi-major axis greater than that of the Earth (a &gt; 1 AU) but perihelion distances less than the Earth&#x27;s aphelion distance (q &lt; 1.017 AU).

, the number of known Apollo asteroids is 21,083, making the class the largest group of near-Earth objects (&quot;cf&quot;. the Aten, Amor and Atira asteroids), of which 1,742 are numbered (asteroids are not numbered until they have been observed at two or more oppositions), 81 are named, and 2,130 are identified as potentially hazardous asteroids.

The closer their semi-major axis is to Earth&#x27;s, the less eccentricity is needed for the orbits to cross. The Chelyabinsk meteor, that exploded over the city of Chelyabinsk in the southern Urals region of Russia on February 15, 2013, injuring an estimated 1,500 people with flying glass from broken windows, was an Apollo-class asteroid.

== List ==
The largest known Apollo asteroid is 1866 Sisyphus, with a diameter of about 8.5 km. Examples of known Apollo asteroids include:

<doc id="47473" wikidata="Q326139" url="?curid=47473" title="Algal bloom">
<text>An algal bloom or algae bloom is a rapid increase or accumulation in the population of algae in fresh water or marine water systems. It is often recognized by the discoloration in the water from the algae&#x27;s pigments. The term &quot;algae&quot; encompasses many types of aquatic photosynthetic organisms, both macroscopic multicellular organisms like seaweed and microscopic unicellular organisms like cyanobacteria.  &quot;Algal bloom&quot; commonly refers to the rapid growth of microscopic unicellular algae, not macroscopic algae. An example of a macroscopic algal bloom is a kelp forest.

Algal blooms are the result of a nutrient, like nitrogen or phosphorus from various sources (for example fertilizer runoff or other forms of nutrient pollution), entering the aquatic system and causing excessive growth of algae. An algal bloom affects the whole ecosystem.

Consequences range from the benign feeding of higher trophic levels to more harmful effects like blocking sunlight from reaching other organisms, causing a depletion of oxygen levels in the water, and, depending on the organism, secreting toxins into the water. Blooms that can injure animals or the ecology, especially those blooms where toxins are secreted by the algae, are usually called &quot;harmful algal blooms&quot; (HAB), and can lead to fish die-offs, cities cutting off water to residents, or states having to close fisheries. The process of the oversupply of nutrients leading to algae growth and oxygen depletion is called eutrophication.

Algal and bacterial blooms have persistently contributed to mass extinctions driven by global warming in the geologic past, such as during the end-Permian extinction driven by Siberian Traps volcanism and the biotic recovery following the mass extinction.

==Characterization==
The term &quot;algal bloom&quot; is defined inconsistently depending on the scientific field and can range from a &quot;minibloom&quot; of harmless algae to a large, harmful bloom event. Since &quot;algae&quot; is a broad term including organisms of widely varying sizes, growth rates, and nutrient requirements, there is no officially recognized threshold level as to what is defined as a bloom. Because there is no scientific consensus, blooms can be characterized and quantified in several ways: measurements of new algal biomass, the concentration of photosynthetic pigment, quantification of the bloom&#x27;s negative effect, or relative concentration of the algae compared to the rest of the microbial community. For example, definitions of blooms have included when the concentration of chlorophyll exceeds 100 ug/L, when the concentration of chlorophyll exceeds 5 ug/L, when the species considered to be blooming exceeds concentrations of 1000 cells/mL, and when the algae species concentration simply deviates from its normal growth.

Blooms are the result of a nutrient needed by the particular algae being introduced to the local aquatic system. This growth-limiting nutrient is typically nitrogen or phosphorus, but can also be iron, vitamins, or amino acids. There are several mechanisms for the addition of these nutrients in water. In the open ocean and along coastlines, upwelling from both winds and topographical ocean floor features can draw nutrients to the photic, or sunlit zone of the ocean. Along coastal regions and in freshwater systems, agricultural, city, and sewage runoff can cause algal blooms.

Algal blooms, especially large algal bloom events, can reduce the transparency of the water and can discolor the water. The photosynthetic pigments in the algal cells, like chlorophyll and photoprotective pigments, determine the color of the algal bloom. Depending on the organism, its pigments, and the depth in the water column, algal blooms can be green, red, brown, golden, and purple. Bright green blooms in freshwater systems are frequently a result of cyanobacteria (colloquially known as &quot;blue-green algae&quot;) such as &quot;Microcystis&quot;. Blooms may also consist of macroalgal (non-phytoplanktonic) species. These blooms are recognizable by large blades of algae that may wash up onto the shoreline.

Once the nutrient is present in the water, the algae begin to grow at a much faster rate than usual. In a mini bloom, this fast growth benefits the whole ecosystem by providing food and nutrients for other organisms.

Of particular note are the harmful algal blooms (HABs), which are algal bloom events involving toxic or otherwise harmful phytoplankton. Many species can cause harmful algal blooms. For example, &quot;Gymnodinium nagasakiense&quot; can cause harmful red tides, dinoflagellates &quot;Gonyaulax polygramma&quot; can cause oxygen depletion and result in large fish kills, cyanobacteria &quot;Microcystis aeruginosa&quot; can make poisonous toxins, and diatom &quot;Chaetoceros convolutus&quot; can damage fish gills.

==Freshwater algal blooms==
Freshwater algal blooms are the result of an excess of nutrients, particularly some phosphates. Excess nutrients may originate from fertilizers that are applied to land for agricultural or recreational purposes and may also originate from household cleaning products containing phosphorus.

The reduction of phosphorus inputs is required to mitigate blooms that contain cyanobacteria. In lakes that are stratified in the summer, autumn turnover can release substantial quantities of bio-available phosphorus potentially triggering algal blooms as soon as sufficient photosynthetic light is available. Excess nutrients can enter watersheds through water runoff. Excess carbon and nitrogen have also been suspected as causes. Presence of residual sodium carbonate acts as catalyst for the algae to bloom by providing dissolved carbon dioxide for enhanced photosynthesis in the presence of nutrients.

When phosphates are introduced into water systems, higher concentrations cause increased growth of algae and plants. Algae tend to grow very quickly under high nutrient availability, but each alga is short-lived, and the result is a high concentration of dead organic matter which starts to decompose. Natural decomposers present in the water begin decomposing the dead algae, consuming dissolved oxygen present in the water during the process. This can result in a sharp decrease in available dissolved oxygen for other aquatic life. Without sufficient dissolved oxygen in the water, animals and plants may die off in large numbers. This may also be known as a dead zone.

Blooms may be observed in freshwater aquariums when fish are overfed and excess nutrients are not absorbed by plants. These are generally harmful for fish, and the situation can be corrected by changing the water in the tank and then reducing the amount of food given.

=== Natural causes of algal blooms ===
Algal blooms in freshwater systems are not always caused by human contamination and have been observed to occur naturally in both eutrophic and oligotrophic lakes. Eutrophic lakes contain an abundance of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphates which increase the likelihood for blooms. Oligotrophic lakes don&#x27;t contain much of these nutrients. Oligotrophic lakes are defined by various degrees of scarcity. The trophic state index (TSI) measures nutrients in freshwater systems and a TSI under 30 defines oligotrophic waters. However, algal blooms in oligotrophic bodies of water have also been observed. This is a result of cyanobacteria which cause blooms in eutrophic lakes and oligotrophic lakes despite the latter containing a lack of natural and man-made nutrients.

==== Nutrient uptake and cyanobacteria ====
A cause for algal blooms in nutrient-lacking environments come in the form of nutrient uptake. Cyanobacteria have evolved to have better nutrient uptake in oligotrophic waters. Cyanobacteria utilize nitrogen and phosphates in their biological processes. Because of this, cyanobacteria are known to be important in the nitrogen and phosphate fixing cycle in oligotrophic waters. Cyanobacteria can fix nitrogen by accessing atmospheric nitrogen () that has been dissolved into water and transforming it into nitrogen accessible to other organisms. This higher amount of nitrogen is then able to sustain large algae blooms in oligotrophic waters.

Cyanobacteria are able to retain high phosphorus uptake in the absence of nutrients which help their success in oligotrophic environments. Cyanobacteria species such as &quot;D. lemmermannii&quot; are able to move between the hypolimnion which is rich in nutrients such as phosphates and the nutrient-poor metalimnion which lacks phosphates. This causes phosphates to be brought up to the metalimnion and give organisms an abundance of phosphates, exacerbating the likelihood for algal blooms.

==== Upwelling of nutrients ====
Upwelling events happen when nutrients such as phosphates and nitrogen are moved from the nutrient dense hypolimnion to the nutrient poor metalimnion. This happens as result of geological processes such as seasonal overturn when lake surfaces freeze or melt, prompting mixing due to changing water densities mixing up the composition of limnion layers and mixing nutrients around the system. This overabundance in nutrients leads to blooms.

==Marine algal blooms==

Turbulent storms churn the ocean in summer, adding nutrients to sunlit waters near the surface. This sparks a feeding frenzy each spring that gives rise to massive blooms of phytoplankton. Tiny molecules found inside these microscopic plants harvest vital energy from sunlight through photosynthesis. The natural pigments, called chlorophyll, allow phytoplankton to thrive in Earth&#x27;s oceans and enable scientists to monitor blooms from space. Satellites reveal the location and abundance of phytoplankton by detecting the amount of chlorophyll present in coastal and open waters—the higher the concentration, the larger the bloom. Observations show blooms typically last until late spring or early summer, when nutrient stocks are in decline and predatory zooplankton start to graze. The visualization on the left immediately below uses NASA SeaWiFS data to map bloom populations.

The NAAMES study conducted between 2015 and 2019 investigated aspects of phytoplankton dynamics in ocean ecosystems, and how such dynamics influence atmospheric aerosols, clouds, and climate.

In France, citizens are requested to report coloured waters through the project PHENOMER. This helps to understand the occurrence of marine blooms.

Wildfires can cause phytoplankton blooms via oceanic deposition of wildfire aerosols.

==Harmful algal blooms==

A harmful algal bloom (HAB) is an algal bloom that causes negative impacts to other organisms via production of natural toxins, mechanical damage to other organisms, or by other means. The diversity of these HABs make them even harder to manage, and present many issues, especially to threatened coastal areas. HABs are often associated with large-scale marine mortality events and have been associated with various types of shellfish poisonings. Due to their negative economic and health impacts, HABs are often carefully monitored.

HAB has been proved to be harmful to humans. Humans may be exposed to toxic algae by direct consuming seafood containing toxins, swimming or other activities in water, and breathing tiny droplets in the air that contain toxins. Because human exposure can take place by consuming seafood products that contain the toxins expelled by HAB algae, food-borne diseases are present and can affect the nervous, digestive, respiratory, hepatic, dermatological, and cardiac systems in the body. Beach users have often experienced upper respiratory diseases, eye and nose irritation, fever, and have often needed medical care in order to be treated. Ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) is very common from the exposure of algal blooms. Water-borne diseases are also present as our drinking waters can be contaminated by cyanotoxins.

If the HAB event results in a high enough concentration of algae the water may become discoloured or murky, varying in colour from purple to almost pink, normally being red or green. Not all algal blooms are dense enough to cause water discolouration.

=== Bioluminescence ===
&quot;Dinoflagellate&quot;s are microbial eukaryotes that link bioluminesce and toxin production in algal blooms. They use a luciferin-luciferase reaction to create a blue light emission glow. There are seventeen major types of &quot;dinoflagellate&quot; toxins, in which the strains, Saxitoxin and Yessotoxin, are both bioluminescent and toxic. These two strains are found to have similar niches in coastal areas. A surplus of &quot;Dinoflagellates&quot; in the night time creates a blue-green glow, however, in the day, it presents as a red brown color which names algal blooms, Red Tides. &quot;Dinoflagellates&quot; have been reported to be the cause of seafood poisoning from the neurotoxins.

== Management ==
There are three major categories for management of algal blooms consisting of mitigation, prevention, and control. Within mitigation, routine monitoring programs are implemented for toxins in shellfish and an overall surveillance of the area. The HAB levels of the shellfish will be determined and can manage restrictions to keep contaminated shellfish off the food market. Moving fish pens away from algal blooms is also another form of mitigation. Within prevention, this category is less known but policy changes are implemented to control sewage and waste. Within control, there are mechanical, biological, chemical, genetic and environmental controls. Mechanical control involves dispersing clay into the water to aggregate with the HAB leading to less of these HAB to go through the process of sedimentation. Biological control varies largely and can be used through pheromones or releasing sterile males to reduce reproduction. Chemical control uses toxic chemical release. However, it may cause problems of mortality of other non targeted organisms. Genetic control involves genetically engineering species in their environmental tolerances and reproduction processes. However, there are problems of harming indigenous organisms. For environmental control, it can use water circulation and aeration.

== Environmental Impacts ==
Harmful algae blooms have a large effect on the Great Lakes St. Lawrence River Basin. Invasive zebra and quagga mussels are positively correlated with their impact on the environment. These mussels increase the cycling of phosphorus which therefore increases harmful algae blooms in areas they are present. Harmful algae blooms continue to infect water supplies at the Binational Great Lakes Basin and due to the world’s recovery from the Covid-19 Pandemic, solving the issue has become a low priority. This economical problem has become part of politics in the United States, whereas in allied countries such as Canada there is low concern, as well.

The impact of harmful algae blooms on the environment have a substantial effect on marine life. For example, in August 2024 the growth of the toxic algae, &quot;Pseudo-nitzschia&quot;, along California coasts were making sea lions sick and aggressive to beach goers. Scientists claim this is a seasonal occurrence. The growth of &quot;Pseudo-nitzschia&quot; leads to the production of a dominic acid which accumulates in fishes such as sardines, anchovies, and squids. This directly affects the food web and the primary food source of sea lions. Once the toxins are transferred via consumption, they can cause seizures, brain damage, and death to the animal. During this surge, people reported bites and unpredictable, aggressive behavior from the infected sea lions. In this sickened state, the sea lions are scared and act out of fear in order to protect themselves. Pregnant sea lions are most vulnerable to toxic algae poisoning and are more likely to die from the effects.

<text>In optics, the aperture of an optical system (including a system consisted of a single lens) is a hole or an opening that primarily limits light propagated through the system. More specifically, the entrance pupil as the front side image of the aperture and focal length of an optical system determine the cone angle of a bundle of rays that comes to a focus in the image plane.

An optical system typically has many openings or structures that limit ray bundles (ray bundles are also known as &quot;pencils&quot; of light). These structures may be the edge of a lens or mirror, or a ring or other fixture that holds an optical element in place or may be a special element such as a diaphragm placed in the optical path to limit the light admitted by the system. In general, these structures are called stops, and the aperture stop is the stop that primarily determines the cone of rays that an optical system accepts (see entrance pupil). As a result, it also determines the ray cone angle and brightness at the image point (see exit pupil). The aperture stop generally depends on the object point location; on-axis object points at different object planes may have different aperture stops, and even object points at different lateral locations at the same object plane may have different aperture stops (vignetted). In practice, many object systems are designed to have a single aperture stop at designed working distance and field of view.

In some contexts, especially in photography and astronomy, &quot;aperture&quot; refers to the opening diameter of the aperture stop through which light can pass. For example, in a telescope, the aperture stop is typically the edges of the objective lens or mirror (or of the mount that holds it). One then speaks of a telescope as having, for example, a aperture. The aperture stop is not necessarily the smallest stop in the system. Magnification and demagnification by lenses and other elements can cause a relatively large stop to be the aperture stop for the system. In astrophotography, the aperture may be given as a linear measure (for example, in inches or millimetres) or as the dimensionless ratio between that measure and the focal length. In other photography, it is usually given as a ratio.

A usual expectation is that the term &quot;aperture&quot; refers to the opening of the aperture stop, but in reality, the term aperture and the aperture stop are mixed in use. Sometimes even stops that are not the aperture stop of an optical system are also called apertures. Contexts need to clarify these terms.

The word aperture is also used in other contexts to indicate a system which blocks off light outside a certain region. In astronomy, for example, a photometric aperture around a star usually corresponds to a circular window around the image of a star within which the light intensity is assumed.

==Application==

The aperture stop is an important element in most optical designs. Its most obvious feature is that it limits the amount of light that can reach the image/film plane. This can be either unavoidable due to the practical limit of the aperture stop size, or deliberate to prevent saturation of a detector or overexposure of film. In both cases, the size of the aperture stop determines the amount of light admitted by an optical system. The aperture stop also affects other optical system properties:
*The opening size of the stop is one factor that affects DOF (depth of field). A smaller stop (larger f number) produces a longer DOF because it only allows a smaller angle of the cone of light reaching the image plane so the spread of the image of an object point is reduced. A longer DOF allows objects at a wide range of distances from the viewer to all be in focus at the same time.
*The stop limits the effect of optical aberrations by limiting light such that the light does not reach edges of optics where aberrations are usually stronger than the optics centers. If the opening of the stop (called the &quot;aperture&quot;) is too large, then the image will be distorted by stronger aberrations. More sophisticated optical system designs can mitigate the effect of aberrations, allowing a larger aperture and therefore greater light collecting ability.
*The stop determines whether the image will be vignetted. Larger stops can cause the light intensity reaching the film or detector to fall off toward the edges of the picture, especially when, for off-axis points, a different stop becomes the aperture stop by virtue of cutting off more light than did the stop that was the aperture stop on the optic axis.
*The stop location determines the telecentricity. If the aperture stop of a lens is located at the front focal plane of the lens, then it becomes image-space telecentricity, i.e., the lateral size of the image is insensitive to the image plane location. If the stop is at the back focal plane of the lens, then it becomes object-space telecentricity where the image size is insensitive to the object plane location. The telecentricity helps precise two-dimensional measurements because measurement systems with the telecentricity are insensitive to axial position errors of samples or the sensor.

In addition to an aperture stop, a photographic lens may have one or more &quot;field stops&quot;, which limit the system&#x27;s field of view. When the field of view is limited by a field stop in the lens (rather than at the film or sensor) vignetting results; this is only a problem if the resulting field of view is less than was desired.

In astronomy, the opening diameter of the aperture stop (called the &quot;aperture&quot;) is a critical parameter in the design of a telescope. Generally, one would want the &quot;aperture&quot; to be as large as possible, to collect the maximum amount of light from the distant objects being imaged. The size of the aperture is limited, however, in practice by considerations of its manufacturing cost and time and its weight, as well as prevention of aberrations (as mentioned above).

Apertures are also used in laser energy control, close aperture z-scan technique, diffractions/patterns, and beam cleaning. Laser applications include spatial filters, Q-switching, high intensity x-ray control.

In light microscopy, the word aperture may be used with reference to either the condenser (that changes the angle of light onto the specimen field), field iris (that changes the area of illumination on specimens) or possibly objective lens (forms primary images). &quot;See&quot; Optical microscope.

==In photography==
The aperture stop of a photographic lens can be adjusted to control the amount of light reaching the film or image sensor. In combination with variation of shutter speed, the aperture size will regulate the film&#x27;s or image sensor&#x27;s degree of exposure to light. Typically, a fast shutter will require a larger aperture to ensure sufficient light exposure, and a slow shutter will require a smaller aperture to avoid excessive exposure.

A device called a diaphragm usually serves as the aperture stop and controls the aperture (the opening of the aperture stop). The diaphragm functions much like the iris of the eye – it controls the effective diameter of the lens opening (called pupil in the eyes). Reducing the aperture size (increasing the f-number) provides less light to sensor and also increases the depth of field (by limiting the angle of cone of image light reaching the sensor), which describes the extent to which subject matter lying closer than or farther from the actual plane of focus appears to be in focus. In general, the smaller the aperture (the larger the f-number), the greater the distance from the plane of focus the subject matter may be while still appearing in focus.

The lens aperture is usually specified as an f-number, the ratio of focal length to effective aperture diameter (the diameter of the entrance pupil). A lens typically has a set of marked &quot;f-stops&quot; that the f-number can be set to. A lower f-number denotes a greater aperture which allows more light to reach the film or image sensor. The photography term &quot;one f-stop&quot; refers to a factor of (approx. 1.41) change in f-number which corresponds to a change in aperture diameter, which in turn corresponds to a factor of 2 change in light intensity (by a factor 2 change in the aperture area).

Aperture priority is a semi-automatic shooting mode used in cameras. It permits the photographer to select an aperture setting and let the camera decide the shutter speed and sometimes also ISO sensitivity for the correct exposure. This is also referred to as Aperture Priority Auto Exposure, A mode, AV mode (aperture-value mode), or semi-auto mode.

Typical ranges of apertures used in photography are about – or – , covering six stops, which may be divided into wide, middle, and narrow of two stops each, roughly (using round numbers) – , – , and – or (for a slower lens) – , – , and – . These are not sharp divisions, and ranges for specific lenses vary.

===Maximum and minimum apertures===

The specifications for a given lens typically include the maximum and minimum aperture (opening) sizes, for example, – . In this case, is currently the maximum aperture (the widest opening on a full-frame format for practical use), and is the minimum aperture (the smallest opening). The maximum aperture tends to be of most interest and is always included when describing a lens. This value is also known as the lens &quot;speed&quot;, as it affects the exposure time. As the aperture area is proportional to the light admitted by a lens or an optical system, the aperture diameter is proportional to the square root of the light admitted, and thus inversely proportional to the square root of required exposure time, such that an aperture of allows for exposure times one quarter that of . ( is 4 times larger than in the aperture area.)

Lenses with apertures opening or wider are referred to as &quot;fast&quot; lenses, although the specific point has changed over time (for example, in the early 20th century aperture openings wider than were considered fast. The fastest lenses for the common 35 mm film format in general production have apertures of or , with more at and , and many at or slower; is unusual, though sees some use. When comparing &quot;fast&quot; lenses, the image format used must be considered. Lenses designed for a small format such as half frame or APS-C need to project a much smaller image circle than a lens used for large format photography. Thus the optical elements built into the lens can be far smaller and cheaper.

In exceptional circumstances lenses can have even wider apertures with f-numbers smaller than 1.0; see lens speed: fast lenses for a detailed list. For instance, both the current Leica Noctilux-M 50mm ASPH and a 1960s-era Canon 50mm rangefinder lens have a maximum aperture of . Cheaper alternatives began appearing in the early 2010s, such as the Cosina Voigtländer Nokton (several in the range) and () Super Nokton manual focus lenses in the for the Micro Four-Thirds System, and the Venus Optics (Laowa) Argus .

Professional lenses for some movie cameras have f-numbers as small as . Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; has scenes shot by candlelight with a NASA/Zeiss 50mm f/0.7, the fastest lens in film history. Beyond the expense, these lenses have limited application due to the correspondingly shallower depth of field (DOF) – the scene must either be shallow, shot from a distance, or will be significantly defocused, though this may be the desired effect.

Zoom lenses typically have a maximum relative aperture (minimum f-number) of to through their range. High-end lenses will have a constant aperture, such as or , which means that the relative aperture will stay the same throughout the zoom range. A more typical consumer zoom will have a variable maximum relative aperture since it is harder and more expensive to keep the maximum relative aperture proportional to the focal length at long focal lengths; to is an example of a common variable aperture range in a consumer zoom lens.

By contrast, the minimum aperture does not depend on the focal length – it is limited by how narrowly the aperture closes, not the lens design – and is instead generally chosen based on practicality: very small apertures have lower sharpness due to diffraction at aperture edges, while the added depth of field is not generally useful, and thus there is generally little benefit in using such apertures. Accordingly, DSLR lens typically have minimum aperture of , , or , while large format may go down to , as reflected in the name of Group f/64. Depth of field is a significant concern in macro photography, however, and there one sees smaller apertures. For example, the Canon MP-E 65mm can have effective aperture (due to magnification) as small as . The pinhole optic for Lensbaby creative lenses has an aperture of just .

===Aperture area===
The amount of light captured by an optical system is proportional to the area of the entrance pupil that is the object space-side image of the aperture of the system, equal to:

:formula_1

Where the two equivalent forms are related via the f-number &quot;N = f&quot; / &quot;D&quot;, with focal length &quot;f&quot; and entrance pupil diameter &quot;D&quot;.

The focal length value is not required when comparing two lenses of the same focal length; a value of 1 can be used instead, and the other factors can be dropped as well, leaving area proportion to the reciprocal square of the f-number &quot;N&quot;.

If two cameras of different format sizes and focal lengths have the same angle of view, and the same aperture area, they gather the same amount of light from the scene. In that case, the relative focal-plane illuminance, however, would depend only on the f-number &quot;N&quot;, so it is less in the camera with the larger format, longer focal length, and higher f-number. This assumes both lenses have identical transmissivity.

===Aperture control===

Though as early as 1933 Torkel Korling had invented and patented for the Graflex large format reflex camera an automatic aperture control, not all early 35mm single lens reflex cameras had the feature. With a small aperture, this darkened the viewfinder, making viewing, focusing, and composition difficult. Korling&#x27;s design enabled full-aperture viewing for accurate focus, closing to the pre-selected aperture opening when the shutter was fired and simultaneously synchronising the firing of a flash unit. From 1956 SLR camera manufacturers separately developed &quot;automatic aperture control&quot; (the Miranda T &#x27;Pressure Automatic Diaphragm&#x27;, and other solutions on the Exakta Varex IIa and Praktica FX2) allowing viewing at the lens&#x27;s maximum aperture, stopping the lens down to the working aperture at the moment of exposure, and returning the lens to maximum aperture afterward. The first SLR cameras with internal (&quot;through-the-lens&quot; or &quot;TTL&quot;) meters (e.g., the Pentax Spotmatic) required that the lens be stopped down to the working aperture when taking a meter reading. Subsequent models soon incorporated mechanical coupling between the lens and the camera body, indicating the working aperture to the camera for exposure while allowing the lens to be at its maximum aperture for composition and focusing; this feature became known as open-aperture metering.

For some lenses, including a few long telephotos, lenses mounted on bellows, and perspective-control and tilt/shift lenses, the mechanical linkage was impractical, and automatic aperture control was not provided. Many such lenses incorporated a feature known as a &quot;preset&quot; aperture, which allows the lens to be set to working aperture and then quickly switched between working aperture and full aperture without looking at the aperture control. A typical operation might be to establish rough composition, set the working aperture for metering, return to full aperture for a final check of focus and composition, and focusing, and finally, return to working aperture just before exposure. Although slightly easier than stopped-down metering, operation is less convenient than automatic operation. Preset aperture controls have taken several forms; the most common has been the use of essentially two lens aperture rings, with one ring setting the aperture and the other serving as a limit stop when switching to working aperture. Examples of lenses with this type of preset aperture control are the Nikon PC Nikkor 28 mm and the SMC Pentax Shift 6×7 75 mm . The Nikon PC Micro-Nikkor 85 mm lens incorporates a mechanical pushbutton that sets working aperture when pressed and restores full aperture when pressed a second time.

Canon EF lenses, introduced in 1987, have electromagnetic diaphragms, eliminating the need for a mechanical linkage between the camera and the lens, and allowing automatic aperture control with the Canon TS-E tilt/shift lenses. Nikon PC-E perspective-control lenses, introduced in 2008, also have electromagnetic diaphragms, a feature extended to their E-type range in 2013.

===Optimal aperture===
Optimal aperture depends both on optics (the depth of the scene versus diffraction), and on the performance of the lens.

Optically, as a lens is stopped down, the defocus blur at the Depth of Field (DOF) limits decreases but diffraction blur increases. The presence of these two opposing factors implies a point at which the combined blur spot is minimized (Gibson 1975, 64); at that point, the f-number is optimal for image sharpness, for this given depth of field – a wider aperture (lower &quot;f&quot;-number) causes more defocus, while a narrower aperture (higher &quot;f&quot;-number) causes more diffraction.

As a matter of performance, lenses often do not perform optimally when fully opened, and thus generally have better sharpness when stopped down some – this is sharpness in the plane of critical focus, setting aside issues of depth of field. Beyond a certain point, there is no further sharpness benefit to stopping down, and the diffraction occurred at the edges of the aperture begins to become significant for imaging quality. There is accordingly a sweet spot, generally in the – range, depending on lens, where sharpness is optimal, though some lenses are designed to perform optimally when wide open. How significant this varies between lenses, and opinions differ on how much practical impact this has.

While optimal aperture can be determined mechanically, how much sharpness is &quot;required&quot; depends on how the image will be used – if the final image is viewed under normal conditions (e.g., an 8″×10″ image viewed at 10″), it may suffice to determine the f-number using criteria for minimum required sharpness, and there may be no practical benefit from further reducing the size of the blur spot. But this may not be true if the final image is viewed under more demanding conditions, e.g., a very large final image viewed at normal distance, or a portion of an image enlarged to normal size (Hansma 1996). Hansma also suggests that the final-image size may not be known when a photograph is taken, and obtaining the maximum practicable sharpness allows the decision to make a large final image to be made at a later time; see also critical sharpness.

== In biology ==

In many living optical systems, the eye consists of an iris which adjusts the size of the pupil, through which light enters. The iris is analogous to the diaphragm, and the pupil (which is the adjustable opening in the iris) the aperture. Refraction in the cornea causes the effective aperture (the entrance pupil in optics parlance) to differ slightly from the physical pupil diameter. The entrance pupil is typically about 4 mm in diameter, although it can range from as narrow as 2 mm () in diameter in a brightly lit place to 8 mm () in the dark as part of adaptation. In rare cases in some individuals are able to dilate their pupils even beyond 8 mm (in scotopic lighting, close to the physical limit of the iris. In humans, the average iris diameter is about 11.5 mm, which naturally influences the maximal size of the pupil as well, where larger iris diameters would typically have pupils which are able to dilate to a wider extreme than those with smaller irises. Maximum dilated pupil size also decreases with age.

The iris controls the size of the pupil via two complementary sets muscles, the sphincter and dilator muscles, which are innervated by the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems respectively, and act to induce pupillary constriction and dilation respectively. The state of the pupil is closely influenced by various factors, primarily light (or absence of light), but also by emotional state, interest in the subject of attention, arousal, sexual stimulation, physical activity, accommodation state, and cognitive load. The field of view is not affected by the size of the pupil.

Some individuals are also able to directly exert manual and conscious control over their iris muscles and hence are able to voluntarily constrict and dilate their pupils on command. However, this ability is rare and potential use or advantages are unclear.

==Equivalent aperture range==

In digital photography, the 35mm-equivalent aperture range is sometimes considered to be more important than the actual f-number. Equivalent aperture is the f-number adjusted to correspond to the f-number of the same size absolute aperture diameter on a lens with a 35mm equivalent focal length. Smaller equivalent f-numbers are expected to lead to higher image quality based on more total light from the subject, as well as lead to reduced depth of field. For example, a Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX10 uses a 1&quot; sensor, 24 – 200 mm with maximum aperture constant along the zoom range; has equivalent aperture range , which is a lower equivalent f-number than some other cameras with smaller sensors.

However, modern optical research concludes that sensor size does not actually play a part in the depth of field in an image. An aperture&#x27;s f-number is not modified by the camera&#x27;s sensor size because it is a ratio that only pertains to the attributes of the lens. Instead, the higher crop factor that comes as a result of a smaller sensor size means that, in order to get an equal framing of the subject, the photo must be taken from further away, which results in a less blurry background, changing the perceived depth of field. Similarly, a smaller sensor size with an equivalent aperture will result in a darker image because of the pixel density of smaller sensors with equivalent megapixels. Every photosite on a camera&#x27;s sensor requires a certain amount of surface area that is not sensitive to light, a factor that results in differences in pixel pitch and changes in the signal-noise ratio. However, neither the changed depth of field, nor the perceived change in light sensitivity are a result of the aperture. Instead, equivalent aperture can be seen as a rule of thumb to judge how changes in sensor size might affect an image, even if qualities like pixel density and distance from the subject are the actual causes of changes in the image.

==In scanning or sampling==
The terms &quot;scanning aperture&quot; and &quot;sampling aperture&quot; are often used to refer to the opening through which an image is sampled, or scanned, for example in a Drum scanner, an image sensor, or a television pickup apparatus. The sampling aperture can be a literal optical aperture, that is, a small opening in space, or it can be a time-domain aperture for sampling a signal waveform.

For example, film grain is quantified as &quot;graininess&quot; via a measurement of film density fluctuations as seen through a 0.048 mm sampling aperture.

==In popular culture==


Aperture Science, a fictional company in the Portal fictional universe, is named after the optical system. The company&#x27;s logo heavily features an aperture in its logo, and has come to symbolize the series, fictional company, and the Aperture Science Laboratories Computer-Aided Enrichment Center that the game series takes place in.

<text>An altimeter or an altitude meter is an instrument used to measure the altitude of an object above a fixed level. The measurement of altitude is called altimetry, which is related to the term bathymetry, the measurement of depth under water. 

==Types==

===Pressure altimeter===
=== Sonic altimeter ===
In 1931, the US Army Air Corps and General Electric tested a sonic altimeter for aircraft, which was considered more reliable and accurate than one that relied on air pressure when heavy fog or rain was present. The new altimeter used a series of high-pitched sounds like those made by a bat to measure the distance from the aircraft to the surface, which on return to the aircraft was converted to feet shown on a gauge inside the aircraft cockpit.

=== Radar altimeter ===
A radar altimeter measures altitude more directly, using the time taken for a radio signal to reflect from the surface back to the aircraft. Alternatively, Frequency Modulated Continuous-wave radar can be used. The greater the frequency shift the further the distance travelled. This method can achieve much better accuracy than the pulsed radar for the same outlay and radar altimeters that use frequency modulation are industry standard. The radar altimeter is used to measure height above ground level during landing in commercial and military aircraft. Radar altimeters are also a component of terrain avoidance warning systems, warning the pilot if the aircraft is flying too low, or if there is rising terrain ahead. Radar altimeter technology is also used in terrain-following radar allowing combat aircraft to fly at very low height above the terrain.

After extensive research and experimentation, it has been shown that &quot;phase radio-altimeters&quot; are most suitable for ground effect vehicles, as compared to laser, isotropic or ultrasonic altimeters.

=== Laser altimeter ===
Lidar technology is used to help navigate the helicopter Ingenuity on its record-setting flights over the terrain of Mars by means of a downward-facing Lidar altimeter.

===Global Positioning System===
Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers can also determine altitude by trilateration with four or more satellites. In aircraft, altitude determined using autonomous GPS is not reliable enough to supersede the pressure altimeter without using some method of augmentation. In hiking and climbing, it is common to find that the altitude measured by GPS is off by as much as depending on satellite orientation.

<text>The Ames Research Center (ARC), also known as NASA Ames, is a major NASA research center at Moffett Federal Airfield in California&#x27;s Silicon Valley. It was founded in 1939 as the second National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) laboratory. That agency was dissolved and its assets and personnel transferred to the newly created National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on October 1, 1958. NASA Ames is named in honor of Joseph Sweetman Ames, a physicist and one of the founding members of NACA. At last estimate NASA Ames had over US$3 billion in capital equipment, 2,300 research personnel and a US$860 million annual budget.

Ames was founded to conduct wind-tunnel research on the aerodynamics of propeller-driven aircraft; however, its role has expanded to encompass spaceflight and information technology. Ames plays a role in many NASA missions. It provides leadership in astrobiology; small satellites; robotic lunar exploration; the search for habitable planets; supercomputing; intelligent/adaptive systems; advanced thermal protection; planetary science; and airborne astronomy. Ames also develops tools for a safer, more efficient national airspace. The center&#x27;s current director is Eugene Tu.

The site was mission center for several key missions (&quot;Kepler&quot;, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph) and a major contributor to the &quot;new exploration focus&quot; as a participant in the Orion crew exploration vehicle.

== Missions ==
Although Ames is a NASA Research Center, and not a flight center, it has nevertheless been closely involved in a number of astronomy and space missions.

The Pioneer program&#x27;s eight successful space missions from 1965 to 1978 were managed by Charles Hall at Ames, initially aimed at the inner Solar System. By 1972, it supported the bold flyby missions to Jupiter and Saturn with &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;Pioneer 11&quot;. Those two missions were trail blazers (radiation environment, new moons, gravity-assist flybys) for the planners of the more complex &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; missions, launched five years later. In 1978, the end of the program brought about a return to the inner solar system, with the Pioneer Venus Orbiter and Multiprobe, this time using orbital insertion rather than flyby missions.

Lunar Prospector was the third mission selected by NASA for full development and construction as part of the Discovery Program. At a cost of $62.8 million, the 19-month mission was put into a low polar orbit of the Moon, accomplishing mapping of surface composition and possible polar ice deposits, measurements of magnetic and gravity fields, and study of lunar outgassing events. Based on Lunar Prospector Neutron Spectrometer (NS) data, mission scientists have determined that there is indeed water ice in the polar craters of the Moon. The mission ended July 31, 1999, when the orbiter was guided to an impact into a crater near the lunar south pole in an (unsuccessful) attempt to analyze lunar polar water by vaporizing it to allow spectroscopic characterization from Earth telescopes.

The 11-pound (5 kg) GeneSat-1, carrying bacteria inside a miniature laboratory, was launched on December 16, 2006. The very small NASA satellite has proven that scientists can quickly design and launch a new class of inexpensive spacecraft—and conduct significant science.

The Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) mission to look for water on the Moon was a &#x27;secondary payload spacecraft.&#x27; LCROSS began its trip to the Moon on the same rocket as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), which continues to conduct a different lunar task. It launched in April 2009 on an Atlas V rocket from Kennedy Space Center, Florida.

The &quot;Kepler&quot; mission was NASA&#x27;s first mission capable of finding Earth-size and smaller planets. The &quot;Kepler&quot; mission monitored the brightness of stars to find planets that pass in front of them during the planets&#x27; orbits. During such passes or &#x27;transits,&#x27; the planets will slightly decrease the star&#x27;s brightness.

Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) was a joint venture of the U.S. and German aerospace agencies, NASA and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to make an infrared telescope platform that can fly at altitudes high enough to be in the infrared-transparent regime above the water vapor in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The aircraft was supplied by the U.S., and the infrared telescope by Germany. Modifications of the Boeing 747SP airframe to accommodate the telescope, mission-unique equipment and large external door were made by L-3 Communications Integrated Systems of Waco, Texas.

The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph mission is a partnership with the Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory to understand the processes at the boundary between the Sun&#x27;s chromosphere and corona. This mission is sponsored by the NASA Small Explorer program.

The Lunar Atmosphere Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission has been developed by NASA Ames. This successfully launched to the Moon on September 6, 2013.

In addition, Ames has played a support role in a number of missions, most notably the &quot;Mars Pathfinder&quot; and Mars Exploration Rover missions, where the Ames Intelligent Robotics Laboratory played a key role. NASA Ames was a partner on the Mars &quot;Phoenix&quot;, a Mars Scout Program mission to send a high-latitude lander to Mars, deployed a robotic arm to dig trenches up to 1.6 feet (one half meter) into the layers of water ice and analyzing the soil composition. Ames is also a partner on the Mars Science Laboratory and its &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover, a next generation Mars rover to explore for signs of organics and complex molecules.

==Air traffic control automation research==
The Aviation Systems Division conducts research and development in two primary areas: air traffic management, and high-fidelity flight simulation. For air traffic management, researchers are creating and testing concepts to allow for up to three times today&#x27;s level of aircraft in the national airspace. Automation and its attendant safety consequences are key foundations of the concept development. Historically, the division has developed products that have been implemented for the flying public, such as the Traffic Management Adviser, which is being deployed nationwide. For high-fidelity flight simulation, the division operates the world&#x27;s largest flight simulator (the Vertical Motion Simulator), a Level-D 747-400 simulator, and a panoramic air traffic control tower simulator. These simulators have been used for a variety of purposes including continued training for Space Shuttle pilots, development of future spacecraft handling qualities, helicopter control system testing, Joint Strike Fighter evaluations, and accident investigations. Personnel in the division have a variety of technical backgrounds, including guidance and control, flight mechanics, flight simulation, and computer science. Customers outside NASA have included the FAA, DOD, DHS, DOT, NTSB, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing.

The center&#x27;s flight simulation and guidance laboratory was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.

== Information technology ==
Ames is the home of NASA&#x27;s large research and development divisions in Advanced Supercomputing, Human Factors, and Artificial Intelligence (Intelligent Systems). These Research &amp; Development organizations support NASA&#x27;s Exploration efforts, as well as the continued operations of the International Space Station, and the space science and Aeronautics work across NASA. The center also runs and maintains the E Root nameserver of the DNS.

The Intelligent Systems Division (Code TI) is NASA&#x27;s leading R&amp;D Division developing advanced intelligent software and systems for all of NASA Mission Directorates. It provides software expertise for earth science applications, aeronautics, space science missions, International Space Station, and the Crewed Exploration Vehicle (CEV).

The first AI in space (Deep Space 1) was developed from Code TI, as is the MAPGEN software that daily plans the activities for the Mars Exploration Rovers, the same core reasoner is used for Ensemble to operate &quot;Phoenix&quot; Lander, and the planning system for the International Space Station&#x27;s solar arrays. Integrated System Health Management for the International Space Station&#x27;s control moment gyroscopes, collaborative systems with semantic search tools, and robust software engineering round out the scope of Code TI&#x27;s work.

The Human Systems Integration Division &quot;advances human-centered design and operations of complex aerospace systems through analysis, experimentation, and modeling of human performance and human-automation interaction to make dramatic improvements in safety, efficiency and mission success&quot;. For decades, the Human Systems Integration Division has been on the leading edge of human-centered aerospace research. The Division is home to over 100 researchers, contractors and administrative staff.

The NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division at Ames operates several of the agency&#x27;s most powerful supercomputers, including the petaflop-scale Pleiades, Aitken, and Electra systems. Originally called the Numerical Aerodynamic Simulation Division, the facility has housed more than 40 production and test supercomputers since its construction in 1987, and has served as a leader in high-performance computing, developing technology used across the industry, including the NAS Parallel Benchmarks and the Portable Batch System (PBS) job scheduling software.

In September 2009, Ames launched NEBULA as a fast and powerful Cloud Computing Platform to handle NASA&#x27;s massive data sets that complied with security requirements. This innovative pilot uses open-source components, complies with FISMA and can scale to Government-sized demands while being extremely energy efficient. In July 2010, NASA CTO Chris C. Kemp open sourced Nova, the technology behind the NEBULA Project in collaboration with Rackspace, launching OpenStack. OpenStack has subsequently become one of the largest and fastest growing open source projects in the history of computing, and has been included in most major distributions of Linux including Red Hat, Oracle, HP, SUSE, and Canonical.

== Image processing ==
NASA Ames was one of the first locations to conduct research on image processing of satellite-platform aerial photography. Some of the pioneering techniques of contrast enhancement using Fourier analysis were developed at Ames in conjunction with researchers at ESL Inc.

== Wind tunnels ==
The NASA Ames Research Center wind tunnels are known not only for their immense size, but also for their diverse characteristics that enable various kinds of scientific and engineering research.

===ARC Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel===

The Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel (UPWT) was completed in 1956 at a cost of $27 million under the Unitary Plan Act of 1949. Since its completion, the UPWT facility has been the most heavily used NASA wind tunnel within the NASA Wind Tunnel Fleet. Every major commercial transport and almost every military jet built in the United States over the last 40 years has been tested in this facility. Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo spacecraft, as well as Space Shuttle, were also tested in this tunnel complex.

===National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC)===
Ames Research Center also houses the world&#x27;s largest wind tunnel, part of the National Full-Scale Aerodynamic Complex (NFAC): it is large enough to test full-sized planes, rather than scale models. The complex of wind tunnels was listed on the National Register in 2017.
The 40 by 80 foot wind tunnel circuit was originally constructed in the 1940s and is now capable of providing test velocities up to . It is used to support an active research program in aerodynamics, dynamics, model noise, and full-scale aircraft and their components. The aerodynamic characteristics of new configurations are investigated with an emphasis on estimating the accuracy of computational methods. The tunnel is also used to investigate the aeromechanical stability boundaries of advanced rotorcraft and rotor-fuselage interactions. Stability and control derivatives are also determined, including the static and dynamic characteristics of new aircraft configurations. The acoustic characteristics of most of the full-scale vehicles are also determined, as well as acoustic research aimed at discovering and reducing aerodynamic sources of noise. In addition to the normal data gathering methods (e.g., balance system, pressure measuring transducers, and temperature sensing thermocouples), state-of-the-art, non-intrusive instrumentation (e.g., laser velocimeters and shadowgraphs) are available to help determine flow direction and velocity in and around the lifting surfaces of aircraft. The 40 by 80 Foot Wind Tunnel is primarily used for determining the low- and medium-speed aerodynamic characteristics of high-performance aircraft, rotorcraft, and fixed wing, powered-lift V/STOL aircraft.

The 80 by 120 Foot Wind Tunnel is the world&#x27;s largest wind tunnel test section. This open circuit leg was added and a new fan drive system was installed in the 1980s. It is currently capable of air speeds up to . This section is used in similar ways to the 40 by 80 foot section, but it is capable of testing larger aircraft, albeit at slower speeds. Some of the test programs that have come through the 80 by 120 Foot include: F-18 High Angle of Attack Vehicle, DARPA/Lockheed Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter, XV-15 Tilt Rotor, and Advance Recovery System Parafoil. The 80 by 120 foot test section is capable of testing a full size Boeing 737.

Although decommissioned by NASA in 2003, the NFAC is now being operated by the United States Air Force as a satellite facility of the Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC).

== Arc Jet Complex ==

The Ames Arc Jet Complex is an advanced thermophysics facility where sustained hypersonic- and hyperthermal testing of vehicular thermoprotective systems takes place under a variety of simulated flight- and re-entry conditions. Of its seven available test bays, four currently contain Arc Jet units of differing configurations, serviced by common facility support equipment. These are the Aerodynamic Heating Facility (AHF), the Turbulent Flow Duct (TFD), the Panel Test Facility (PTF), and the Interaction Heating Facility (IHF). The support equipment includes two D.C. power supplies, a steam ejector-driven vacuum system, a water-cooling system, high-pressure gas systems, data acquisition system, and other auxiliary systems.

The magnitude and capacity of these systems makes the Ames Arc Jet Complex unique. The largest power supply can deliver 75 megawatts (MW) for a 30-minute duration or 150 MW for a 15-second duration. This power capacity, in combination with a high-volume 5-stage steam ejector vacuum-pumping system, enables facility operations to match high-altitude atmospheric flight conditions with samples of relatively large size. The Thermo-Physics Facilities Branch operates four arc jet facilities. The Interaction Heating Facility (IHF), with an available power of over 60-MW, is one of the highest-power arc jets available. It is a very flexible facility, capable of long run times of up to one hour, and able to test large samples in both a stagnation and flat plate configuration. The Panel Test Facility (PTF) uses a unique semielliptic nozzle for testing panel sections. Powered by a 20-MW arc heater, the PTF can perform tests on samples for up to 20 minutes. The Turbulent Flow Duct provides supersonic, turbulent high temperature air flows over flat surfaces. The TFD is powered by a 20-MW Hüls arc heater and can test samples in size. The Aerodynamic Heating Facility (AHF) has similar characteristics to the IHF arc heater, offering a wide range of operating conditions, sample sizes and extended test times. A cold-air-mixing plenum allows for simulations of ascent or high-speed flight conditions. Catalycity studies using air or nitrogen can be performed in this flexible rig. A 5-arm model support system allows the user to maximize testing efficiency. The AHF can be configured with either a Hüls or segmented arc heater, up to 20-MW. 1 MW is enough power to supply 750 homes.

The Arc Jet Complex was listed on the National Register in 2017.

== Range complex ==
===Ames Vertical Gun Range===

The Ames Vertical Gun Range (AVGR) was designed to conduct scientific studies of lunar impact processes in support of the Apollo missions. In 1979, it was established as a National Facility, funded through the Planetary Geology and Geophysics Program. In 1995, increased scientific needs across various disciplines resulted in joint core funding by three different science programs at NASA Headquarters (Planetary Geology and Geophysics, Exobiology, and Solar System Origins). In addition, the AVGR provides programmatic support for various proposed and ongoing planetary missions (e.g. Stardust, Deep Impact).

Using its 0.30 cal light-gas gun and powder gun, the AVGR can launch projectiles to velocities ranging from . By varying the gun&#x27;s angle of elevation with respect to the target vacuum chamber, impact angles from 0° to 90° relative to the gravitational vector are possible. This unique feature is extremely important in the study of crater formation processes.

The target chamber is approximately in diameter and height and can accommodate a wide variety of targets and mounting fixtures. It can maintain vacuum levels below , or can be back filled with various gases to simulate different planetary atmospheres. Impact events are typically recorded with high-speed video/film, or Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV).

===Hypervelocity Free-Flight Range===

The Hypervelocity Free-Flight (HFF) Range currently comprises two active facilities: the Aerodynamic Facility (HFFAF) and the Gun Development Facility (HFFGDF). The HFFAF is a combined Ballistic Range and Shock-tube Driven Wind Tunnel. Its primary purpose is to examine the aerodynamic characteristics and flow-field structural details of free-flying aeroballistic models.

The HFFAF has a test section equipped with 16 shadowgraph-imaging stations. Each station can be used to capture an orthogonal pair of images of a hypervelocity model in flight. These images, combined with the recorded flight time history, can be used to obtain critical aerodynamic parameters such as lift, drag, static and dynamic stability, flow characteristics, and pitching moment coefficients. For very high Mach number (M &gt; 25) simulations, models can be launched into a counter-flowing gas stream generated by the shock tube. The facility can also be configured for hypervelocity impact testing and has an aerothermodynamic capability as well. The HFFAF is currently configured to operate the light-gas gun in support of continuing thermal imaging and transition research for NASA&#x27;s hypersonics program.

The HFFGDF is used for gun performance enhancement studies, and occasional impact testing. The Facility uses the same arsenal of light-gas and powder guns as the HFFAF to accelerate particles that range in size from diameter to velocities ranging from . Most of the research effort to date has centered on Earth atmosphere entry configurations (Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and Shuttle), planetary entry designs (Viking, Pioneer Venus, &quot;Galileo&quot; and MSL), and aerobraking (AFE) configurations. The facility has also been used for scramjet propulsion studies (National Aerospace Plane (NASP)) and meteoroid/orbital debris impact studies (Space Station and RLV). In 2004, the facility was utilized for foam-debris dynamics testing in support of the Return To Flight effort. As of March 2007, the GDF has been reconfigured to operate a cold gas gun for subsonic CEV capsule aerodynamics.

===Electric Arc Shock Tube===
The Electric Arc Shock Tube (EAST) Facility is used to investigate the effects of radiation and ionization that occur during very high velocity atmospheric entries. In addition, the EAST can also provide air-blast simulations requiring the strongest possible shock generation in air at an initial pressure loading of or greater. The facility has three separate driver configurations, to meet a range of test requirements: the driver can be connected to a diaphragm station of either a or a shock tube, and the high-pressure shock tube can also drive a shock tunnel. Energy for the drivers is supplied by a 1.25-MJ-capacitor storage system.

==United States Geological Survey (USGS)==
In September 2016, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) announced plans to relocate its West Coast science center from nearby Menlo Park to the Ames Research Center at Moffett Field. The relocation is expected to take five years and will begin in 2017 with 175 of the USGS employees moving to Moffett. The relocation is designed to save money on the $7.5 million annual rent the USGS pays for its Menlo Park campus. The land in Menlo Park is owned by the General Services Administration, which is required by federal law to charge market-rate rent.

== Education ==

=== NASA Ames Visitor Center ===
The NASA Experience exhibit at the Chabot Space and Science Center serves as the visitor center for NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center. The NASA Experience provides a dynamic and interactive space for the public to learn about local contributions to space exploration across the years. From models of spacecraft and genuine spacesuits from as early as the Mercury and Gemini missions to artifacts related to NASA&#x27;s upcoming Artemis missions, the NASA Ames Visitor Center gives visitors access to over 80 years of Ames history and a look into current and future projects. Ames&#x27; expertise in wind tunnel testing, rover design and testing, space robotics, supercomputing, and more is on display. The exhibit was opened on November 12, 2021.

=== NASA Ames Exploration Center ===
The NASA Ames Exploration Center is a science museum and education center for NASA. There are displays and interactive exhibits about NASA technology, missions and space exploration. A Moon rock, meteorite, and other geologic samples are on display. The theater shows movies with footage from NASA&#x27;s explorations of Mars and the planets, and about the contributions of the scientists at Ames. This facility is currently closed.

=== Robotics Alliance Project ===
In 1999, Mark León developed NASA&#x27;s Robotics Education Project — now called the Robotics Alliance Project — under his mentor Dave Lavery, which has reached over 100,000 students nationwide using FIRST robotics and BOTBALL robotics competitions. The Project&#x27;s FIRST branch originally comprised FRC Team 254: &quot;The Cheesy Poofs&quot;, an all-male team from Bellarmine High School in San Jose, California. In 2006, Team 1868: &quot;The Space Cookies&quot;, an all-female team, was founded in collaboration with the Girl Scouts. In 2012, Team 971: &quot;Spartan Robotics&quot; of Mountain View High School joined the Project, though the team continues to operate at their school. All three teams are highly decorated. All three have won Regional competitions, two have won the FIRST Championship, two have won the Regional Chairman&#x27;s Award, and one is a Hall of Fame team. The three teams are collectively referred to as &quot;House teams&quot;.

The mission of the project is &quot;To create a human, technical, and programmatic resource of robotics capabilities to enable the implementation of future robotic space exploration missions.&quot;

== Public-private partnerships ==

The federal government has re-tasked portions of the facility and human resources to support private sector industry, research, and education.

HP became the first corporate affiliate of a new Bio-Info-Nano Research and Development Institute (BIN-RDI); a collaborative venture established by the University of California Santa Cruz and NASA, based at Ames. The Bio|Info|Nano R&amp;D Institute is dedicated to creating scientific breakthroughs by the convergence of biotechnology, information technology, and nanotechnology.

Singularity University hosts its leadership and educational program at the facility. The Organ Preservation Alliance is also headquartered there; the Alliance is a nonprofit organization that works in partnership with the Methuselah Foundation&#x27;s New Organ Prize &quot;to catalyze breakthroughs on the remaining obstacles towards the long-term storage of organs&quot; to overcome the drastic unmet medical need for viable organs for transplantation. Kleenspeed Technologies is headquartered there.

===Google===
On September 28, 2005, Google and Ames Research Center disclosed details to a long-term research partnership. In addition to pooling engineering talent, Google planned to build a facility on the ARC campus. One of the projects between Ames, Google, and Carnegie Mellon University is the Gigapan Project – a robotic platform for creating, sharing, and annotating terrestrial gigapixel images. The Planetary Content Project seeks to integrate and improve the data that Google uses for its Google Moon and Google Mars projects. On 4 June 2008, Google announced it had leased from NASA, at Moffett Field, for use as office space and employee housing.

Construction of the new Google project which is near Google&#x27;s Googleplex headquarters began in 2013 and has a target opening date in 2015. It is called &quot;Bay View&quot; as it overlooks San Francisco Bay.

In May 2013, Google announced that it was launching the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab, to be hosted by ARC. The lab will house a 512 qubit quantum computer from D-Wave Systems, and the Universities Space Research Association (USRA) will invite researchers from around the world to share time on it. The goal being to study how quantum computing might advance machine learning.

Announced on November 10, 2014, Planetary Ventures LLC (a Google subsidiary) will lease the Moffett Federal Airfield from NASA Ames, a site of about 1,000 acres formerly costing the agency $6.3 million annually in maintenance and operation costs. The lease includes the restoration of the site&#x27;s historic landmark Hangar One, as well as hangars Two and Three. The lease went into effect in March 2015, and spans 60 years.

== Living and working at Ames ==
An official NASA ID is required to enter Ames.

There are myriad activities both inside the research center and around the base for full-time workers and interns alike. Portions of a fitness trail remain inside the base (also called a &quot;Parcourse trail&quot;), Sections of it are now inaccessible due to changes in base layout since it was installed.

<text>An aquifer is an underground layer of water-bearing material, consisting of permeable or fractured rock, or of unconsolidated materials (gravel, sand, or silt). Aquifers vary greatly in their characteristics. The study of water flow in aquifers and the characterization of aquifers is called &quot;hydrogeology&quot;. Related concepts include aquitard, a bed of low permeability along an aquifer, and aquiclude (or &quot;aquifuge&quot;), a solid and impermeable region underlying or overlying an aquifer, the pressure of which could lead to the formation of a confined aquifer. Aquifers can be classified as saturated versus unsaturated; aquifers versus aquitards; confined versus unconfined; isotropic versus anisotropic; porous, karst, or fractured; and transboundary aquifer.

Groundwater from aquifers can be sustainably harvested by humans through the use of qanats leading to a well. This groundwater is a major source of fresh water for many regions, however can present a number of challenges such as overdrafting (extracting groundwater beyond the equilibrium yield of the aquifer), groundwater-related subsidence of land, and the salinization or pollution of the groundwater.

== Properties ==
=== Depth ===

Aquifers occur from near-surface to deeper than . Those closer to the surface are not only more likely to be used for water supply and irrigation, but are also more likely to be replenished by local rainfall. Although aquifers are sometimes characterized as &quot;underground rivers or lakes,&quot; they are actually porous rock saturated with water.

Many desert areas have limestone hills or mountains within them or close to them that can be exploited as groundwater resources. Part of the Atlas Mountains in North Africa, the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges between Syria and Lebanon, the Jebel Akhdar in Oman, parts of the Sierra Nevada and neighboring ranges in the United States&#x27; Southwest, have shallow aquifers that are exploited for their water. Overexploitation can lead to the exceeding of the practical sustained yield; i.e., more water is taken out than can be replenished.

Along the coastlines of certain countries, such as Libya and Israel, increased water usage associated with population growth has caused a lowering of the water table and the subsequent contamination of the groundwater with saltwater from the sea.

In 2013 large freshwater aquifers were discovered under continental shelves off Australia, China, North America and South Africa. They contain an estimated half a million cubic kilometers of &quot;low salinity&quot; water that could be economically processed into potable water. The reserves formed when ocean levels were lower and rainwater made its way into the ground in land areas that were not submerged until the ice age ended 20,000 years ago. The volume is estimated to be 100 times the amount of water extracted from other aquifers since 1900.

===Groundwater recharge===
== Classification ==
An &quot;&quot; is a zone within the Earth that restricts the flow of groundwater from one aquifer to another. An aquitard can sometimes, if completely impermeable, be called an &quot;aquiclude&quot; or &quot;aquifuge&quot;. Aquitards are composed of layers of either clay or non-porous rock with low hydraulic conductivity.

=== Saturated versus unsaturated ===

Groundwater can be found at nearly every point in the Earth&#x27;s shallow subsurface to some degree, although aquifers do not necessarily contain fresh water. The Earth&#x27;s crust can be divided into two regions: the &quot;saturated zone&quot; or &quot;phreatic zone&quot; (e.g., aquifers, aquitards, etc.), where all available spaces are filled with water, and the &quot;unsaturated zone&quot; (also called the vadose zone), where there are still pockets of air that contain some water, but can be filled with more water.

&quot;Saturated&quot; means the pressure head of the water is greater than atmospheric pressure (it has a gauge pressure &gt; 0). The definition of the water table is the surface where the pressure head is equal to atmospheric pressure (where gauge pressure = 0).

&quot;Unsaturated&quot; conditions occur above the water table where the pressure head is negative (absolute pressure can never be negative, but gauge pressure can) and the water that incompletely fills the pores of the aquifer material is under suction. The water content in the unsaturated zone is held in place by surface adhesive forces and it rises above the water table (the zero-gauge-pressure isobar) by capillary action to saturate a small zone above the phreatic surface (the capillary fringe) at less than atmospheric pressure. This is termed tension saturation and is not the same as saturation on a water-content basis. Water content in a capillary fringe decreases with increasing distance from the phreatic surface. The capillary head depends on soil pore size. In sandy soils with larger pores, the head will be less than in clay soils with very small pores. The normal capillary rise in a clayey soil is less than but can range between .

The capillary rise of water in a small-diameter tube involves the same physical process. The water table is the level to which water will rise in a large-diameter pipe (e.g., a well) that goes down into the aquifer and is open to the atmosphere.

=== Aquifers versus aquitards ===
Aquifers are typically saturated regions of the subsurface that produce an economically feasible quantity of water to a well or spring (e.g., sand and gravel or fractured bedrock often make good aquifer materials).

An aquitard is a zone within the Earth that restricts the flow of groundwater from one aquifer to another. A completely impermeable aquitard is called an &quot;aquiclude&quot; or &quot;aquifuge&quot;. Aquitards contain layers of either clay or non-porous rock with low hydraulic conductivity.

In mountainous areas (or near rivers in mountainous areas), the main aquifers are typically unconsolidated alluvium, composed of mostly horizontal layers of materials deposited by water processes (rivers and streams), which in cross-section (looking at a two-dimensional slice of the aquifer) appear to be layers of alternating coarse and fine materials. Coarse materials, because of the high energy needed to move them, tend to be found nearer the source (mountain fronts or rivers), whereas the fine-grained material will make it farther from the source (to the flatter parts of the basin or overbank areas—sometimes called the pressure area). Since there are less fine-grained deposits near the source, this is a place where aquifers are often unconfined (sometimes called the forebay area), or in hydraulic communication with the land surface.

=== Confined versus unconfined ===
An unconfined aquifer has no impermeable barrier immediately above it, such that the water level can rise in response to recharge. A confined aquifer has an overlying impermeable barrier that prevents the water level in the aquifer from rising any higher. An aquifer in the same geologic unit may be confined in one area and unconfined in another. &quot;Unconfined&quot; aquifers are sometimes also called &quot;water table&quot; or &quot;phreatic&quot; aquifers, because their upper boundary is the water table or phreatic surface (see Biscayne Aquifer). Typically (but not always) the shallowest aquifer at a given location is unconfined, meaning it does not have a confining layer (an aquitard or aquiclude) between it and the surface. The term &quot;perched&quot; refers to ground water accumulating above a low-permeability unit or strata, such as a clay layer. This term is generally used to refer to a small local area of ground water that occurs at an elevation higher than a regionally extensive aquifer. The difference between perched and unconfined aquifers is their size (perched is smaller). Confined aquifers are aquifers that are overlain by a confining layer, often made up of clay. The confining layer might offer some protection from surface contamination.

If the distinction between confined and unconfined is not clear geologically (i.e., if it is not known if a clear confining layer exists, or if the geology is more complex, e.g., a fractured bedrock aquifer), the value of storativity returned from an aquifer test can be used to determine it (although aquifer tests in unconfined aquifers should be interpreted differently than confined ones). Confined aquifers have very low storativity values (much less than 0.01, and as little as ), which means that the aquifer is storing water using the mechanisms of aquifer matrix expansion and the compressibility of water, which typically are both quite small quantities. Unconfined aquifers have storativities (typically called specific yield) greater than 0.01 (1% of bulk volume); they release water from storage by the mechanism of actually draining the pores of the aquifer, releasing relatively large amounts of water (up to the drainable porosity of the aquifer material, or the minimum volumetric water content).
=== Isotropic versus anisotropic ===
In isotropic aquifers or aquifer layers the hydraulic conductivity (K) is equal for flow in all directions, while in anisotropic conditions it differs, notably in horizontal (Kh) and vertical (Kv) sense.

Semi-confined aquifers with one or more aquitards work as an anisotropic system, even when the separate layers are isotropic, because the compound Kh and Kv values are different (see hydraulic transmissivity and hydraulic resistance).

When calculating flow to drains or flow to wells in an aquifer, the anisotropy is to be taken into account lest the resulting design of the drainage system may be faulty.

===Porous, karst, or fractured===

To properly manage an aquifer its properties must be understood. Many properties must be known to predict how an aquifer will respond to rainfall, drought, pumping, and contamination. Considerations include where and how much water enters the groundwater from rainfall and snowmelt, how fast and in what direction the groundwater travels, and how much water leaves the ground as springs. Computer models can be used to test how accurately the understanding of the aquifer properties matches the actual aquifer performance. Environmental regulations require sites with potential sources of contamination to demonstrate that the hydrology has been characterized.

====Porous====
Porous aquifers typically occur in sand and sandstone. Porous aquifer properties depend on the depositional sedimentary environment and later natural cementation of the sand grains. The environment where a sand body was deposited controls the orientation of the sand grains, the horizontal and vertical variations, and the distribution of shale layers. Even thin shale layers are important barriers to groundwater flow. All these factors affect the porosity and permeability of sandy aquifers.

Sandy deposits formed in shallow marine environments and in windblown sand dune environments have moderate to high permeability while sandy deposits formed in river environments have low to moderate permeability. Rainfall and snowmelt enter the groundwater where the aquifer is near the surface. Groundwater flow directions can be determined from potentiometric surface maps of water levels in wells and springs. Aquifer tests and well tests can be used with Darcy&#x27;s law flow equations to determine the ability of a porous aquifer to convey water.

Analyzing this type of information over an area gives an indication how much water can be pumped without overdrafting and how contamination will travel. In porous aquifers groundwater flows as slow seepage in pores between sand grains. A groundwater flow rate of 1 foot per day (0.3 m/d) is considered to be a high rate for porous aquifers, as illustrated by the water slowly seeping from sandstone in the accompanying image to the left.

Porosity is important, but, &quot;alone&quot;, it does not determine a rock&#x27;s ability to act as an aquifer. Areas of the Deccan Traps (a basaltic lava) in west central India are good examples of rock formations with high porosity but low permeability, which makes them poor aquifers. Similarly, the micro-porous (Upper Cretaceous) Chalk Group of south east England, although having a reasonably high porosity, has a low grain-to-grain permeability, with its good water-yielding characteristics mostly due to micro-fracturing and fissuring.

====Karst====

Karst aquifers typically develop in limestone. Surface water containing natural carbonic acid moves down into small fissures in limestone. This carbonic acid gradually dissolves limestone thereby enlarging the fissures. The enlarged fissures allow a larger quantity of water to enter which leads to a progressive enlargement of openings. Abundant small openings store a large quantity of water. The larger openings form a conduit system that drains the aquifer to springs.

Characterization of karst aquifers requires field exploration to locate sinkholes, swallets, sinking streams, and springs in addition to studying geologic maps. Conventional hydrogeologic methods such as aquifer tests and potentiometric mapping are insufficient to characterize the complexity of karst aquifers. These conventional investigation methods need to be supplemented with dye traces, measurement of spring discharges, and analysis of water chemistry. U.S. Geological Survey dye tracing has determined that conventional groundwater models that assume a uniform distribution of porosity are not applicable for karst aquifers.

Linear alignment of surface features such as straight stream segments and sinkholes develop along fracture traces. Locating a well in a fracture trace or intersection of fracture traces increases the likelihood to encounter good water production. Voids in karst aquifers can be large enough to cause destructive collapse or subsidence of the ground surface that can initiate a catastrophic release of contaminants. Groundwater flow rate in karst aquifers is much more rapid than in porous aquifers as shown in the accompanying image to the left. For example, in the Barton Springs Edwards aquifer, dye traces measured the karst groundwater flow rates from 0.5 to 7 miles per day (0.8 to 11.3 km/d). The rapid groundwater flow rates make karst aquifers much more sensitive to groundwater contamination than porous aquifers.

In the extreme case, groundwater may exist in &quot;underground rivers&quot; (e.g., caves underlying karst topography).

====Fractured====
If a rock unit of low porosity is highly fractured, it can also make a good aquifer (via fissure flow), provided the rock has a hydraulic conductivity sufficient to facilitate movement of water.

== Human use of groundwater ==

Challenges for using groundwater include: overdrafting (extracting groundwater beyond the equilibrium yield of the aquifer), groundwater-related subsidence of land, groundwater becoming saline, and groundwater pollution.

== By country or continent ==

=== Africa ===
Aquifer depletion is a problem in some areas, especially in northern Africa, where one example is the Great Manmade River project of Libya. However, new methods of groundwater management such as artificial recharge and injection of surface waters during seasonal wet periods has extended the life of many freshwater aquifers, especially in the United States.

=== Australia ===
The Great Artesian Basin situated in Australia is arguably the largest groundwater aquifer in the world (over ). It plays a large part in water supplies for Queensland, and some remote parts of South Australia.

=== Canada ===
Discontinuous sand bodies at the base of the McMurray Formation in the Athabasca Oil Sands region of northeastern Alberta, Canada, are commonly referred to as the Basal Water Sand (BWS) aquifers. Saturated with water, they are confined beneath impermeable bitumen-saturated sands that are exploited to recover bitumen for synthetic crude oil production. Where they are deep-lying and recharge occurs from underlying Devonian formations they are saline, and where they are shallow and recharged by surface water they are non-saline. The BWS typically pose problems for the recovery of bitumen, whether by open-pit mining or by &quot;in situ&quot; methods such as steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), and in some areas they are targets for waste-water injection.

=== South America ===
The Guarani Aquifer, located beneath the surface of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, is one of the world&#x27;s largest aquifer systems and is an important source of fresh water. Named after the Guarani people, it covers , with a volume of about , a thickness of between and a maximum depth of about .

=== United States ===
The Ogallala Aquifer of the central United States is one of the world&#x27;s great aquifers, but in places it is being rapidly depleted by growing municipal use, and continuing agricultural use. This huge aquifer, which underlies portions of eight states, contains primarily fossil water from the time of the last glaciation. Annual recharge, in the more arid parts of the aquifer, is estimated to total only about 10 percent of annual withdrawals. According to a 2013 report by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the depletion between 2001 and 2008, inclusive, is about 32 percent of the cumulative depletion during the entire 20th century.

In the United States, the biggest users of water from aquifers include agricultural irrigation and oil and coal extraction. &quot;Cumulative total groundwater depletion in the United States accelerated in the late 1940s and continued at an almost steady linear rate through the end of the century. In addition to widely recognized environmental consequences, groundwater depletion also adversely impacts the long-term sustainability of groundwater supplies to help meet the Nation’s water needs.&quot;

An example of a significant and sustainable carbonate aquifer is the Edwards Aquifer in central Texas. This carbonate aquifer has historically been providing high quality water for nearly 2 million people, and even today, is full because of tremendous recharge from a number of area streams, rivers and lakes. The primary risk to this resource is human development over the recharge areas.

<doc id="47484" wikidata="Q81809" url="?curid=47484" title="Atmospheric pressure">
<text>Atmospheric pressure, also known as air pressure or barometric pressure (after the barometer), is the pressure within the atmosphere of Earth. The standard atmosphere (symbol: atm) is a unit of pressure defined as , which is equivalent to 1,013.25 millibars, 760mm Hg, 29.9212inchesHg, or 14.696psi. The atm unit is roughly equivalent to the mean sea-level atmospheric pressure on Earth; that is, the Earth&#x27;s atmospheric pressure at sea level is approximately 1 atm. 

In most circumstances, atmospheric pressure is closely approximated by the hydrostatic pressure caused by the weight of air above the measurement point. As elevation increases, there is less overlying atmospheric mass, so atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing elevation. Because the atmosphere is thin relative to the Earth&#x27;s radius—especially the dense atmospheric layer at low altitudes—the Earth&#x27;s gravitational acceleration as a function of altitude can be approximated as constant and contributes little to this fall-off. Pressure measures force per unit area, with SI units of pascals (1 pascal = 1 newton per square metre, 1N/m2). On average, a column of air with a cross-sectional area of 1 square centimetre (cm2), measured from the mean (average) sea level to the top of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, has a mass of about 1.03 kilogram and exerts a force or &quot;weight&quot; of about 10.1 newtons, resulting in a pressure of 10.1 N/cm2 or 101kN/m2 (101 kilopascals, kPa). A column of air with a cross-sectional area of 1in2 would have a weight of about 14.7lbf, resulting in a pressure of 14.7lbf/in2.

Atmospheric pressure is caused by the gravitational attraction of the planet on the atmospheric gases above the surface and is a function of the mass of the planet, the radius of the surface, and the amount and composition of the gases and their vertical distribution in the atmosphere. It is modified by the planetary rotation and local effects such as wind velocity, density variations due to temperature and variations in composition.

== Mean sea-level pressure ==

The &quot;mean sea-level pressure&quot; (MSLP) is the atmospheric pressure at mean sea level. This is the atmospheric pressure normally given in weather reports on radio, television, and newspapers or on the Internet.

The &quot;altimeter setting&quot; in aviation is an atmospheric pressure adjustment.

Average &quot;sea-level pressure&quot; is . In aviation weather reports (METAR), QNH is transmitted around the world in hectopascals or millibars (1 hectopascal = 1 millibar). In the United States, Canada, and Japan altimeter setting is reported in inches of mercury (to two decimal places). The United States and Canada also report &quot;sea-level pressure&quot; SLP, which is adjusted to sea level by a different method, in the remarks section, not in the internationally transmitted part of the code, in hectopascals or millibars. However, in Canada&#x27;s public weather reports, sea level pressure is instead reported in kilopascals.

In the US weather code remarks, three digits are all that are transmitted; decimal points and the one or two most significant digits are omitted: is transmitted as 132; is transmitted as 000; 998.7hPa is transmitted as 987; etc. The highest &quot;sea-level pressure&quot; on Earth occurs in Siberia, where the Siberian High often attains a &quot;sea-level pressure&quot; above , with record highs close to . The lowest measurable &quot;sea-level pressure&quot; is found at the centres of tropical cyclones and tornadoes, with a record low of . A system transmitting the last three digits transmits the same code (800) for 1080.0 hPa as for 980.0 hPa.

== Surface pressure ==
&quot;Surface pressure&quot; is the atmospheric pressure at a location on Earth&#x27;s surface (terrain and oceans). It is directly proportional to the mass of air over that location.

For numerical reasons, atmospheric models such as general circulation models (GCMs) usually predict the nondimensional &quot;logarithm of surface pressure&quot;.

The average value of surface pressure on Earth is 985 hPa. This is in contrast to mean sea-level pressure, which involves the extrapolation of pressure to sea level for locations above or below sea level. The average pressure at mean sea level (MSL) in the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) is 1,013.25 hPa, or 1 atmosphere (atm), or 29.92 inches of mercury.

Pressure (P), mass (m), and acceleration due to gravity (g) are related by P = F/A = (m*g)/A, where A is the surface area. Atmospheric pressure is thus proportional to the weight per unit area of the atmospheric mass above that location.

== Altitude variation ==

Pressure on Earth varies with the altitude of the surface, so air pressure on mountains is usually lower than air pressure at sea level. Pressure varies smoothly from the Earth&#x27;s surface to the top of the mesosphere. Although the pressure changes with the weather, NASA has averaged the conditions for all parts of the earth year-round. As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases. One can calculate the atmospheric pressure at a given altitude. Temperature and humidity also affect the atmospheric pressure. Pressure is proportional to temperature and inversely related to humidity, and both of these are necessary to compute an accurate figure. The graph was developed for a temperature of 15 °C and a relative humidity of 0%.

At low altitudes above sea level, the pressure decreases by about for every 100 metres. For higher altitudes within the troposphere, the following equation (the barometric formula) relates atmospheric pressure &quot;p&quot; to altitude &quot;h&quot;:
formula_1

The values in these equations are:
== Local variation ==

Atmospheric pressure varies widely on Earth, and these changes are important in studying weather and climate. Atmospheric pressure shows a diurnal or semidiurnal (twice-daily) cycle caused by global atmospheric tides. This effect is strongest in tropical zones, with an amplitude of a few hectopascals, and almost zero in polar areas. These variations have two superimposed cycles, a circadian (24 h) cycle, and a semi-circadian (12 h) cycle.

== Records ==
The highest adjusted-to-sea level barometric pressure ever recorded on Earth (above 750 meters) was measured in Tosontsengel, Mongolia on 19 December 2001. The highest adjusted-to-sea level barometric pressure ever recorded (below 750 meters) was at Agata in Evenk Autonomous Okrug, Russia (66°53&#x27;N, 93°28&#x27;E, elevation: ) on 31 December 1968 of . The discrimination is due to the problematic assumptions (assuming a standard lapse rate) associated with reduction of sea level from high elevations.

The Dead Sea, the lowest place on Earth at below sea level, has a correspondingly high typical atmospheric pressure of 1,065hPa. A below-sea-level surface pressure record of was set on 21 February 1961.

The lowest non-tornadic atmospheric pressure ever measured was 870 hPa (0.858 atm; 25.69 inHg), set on 12 October 1979, during Typhoon Tip in the western Pacific Ocean. The measurement was based on an instrumental observation made from a reconnaissance aircraft.

== Measurement based on the depth of water ==
One atmosphere () is also the pressure caused by the weight of a column of freshwater of approximately . Thus, a diver 10.3 m under water experiences a pressure of about 2 atmospheres (1 atm of air plus 1 atm of water). Conversely, 10.3 m is the maximum height to which water can be raised using suction under standard atmospheric conditions.

Low pressures, such as natural gas lines, are sometimes specified in inches of water, typically written as &quot;w.c.&quot; (water column) gauge or &quot;w.g.&quot; (inches water) gauge. A typical gas-using residential appliance in the US is rated for a maximum of , which is approximately 14 w.g. Similar metric units with a wide variety of names and notation based on millimetres, centimetres or metres are now less commonly used.

== Boiling point of liquids ==

Pure water boils at at earth&#x27;s standard atmospheric pressure. The boiling point is the temperature at which the vapour pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure around the liquid. Because of this, the boiling point of liquids is lower at lower pressure and higher at higher pressure. Cooking at high elevations, therefore, requires adjustments to recipes or pressure cooking. A rough approximation of elevation can be obtained by measuring the temperature at which water boils; in the mid-19th century, this method was used by explorers. Conversely, if one wishes to evaporate a liquid at a lower temperature, for example in distillation, the atmospheric pressure may be lowered by using a vacuum pump, as in a rotary evaporator.

== Measurement and maps ==
An important application of the knowledge that atmospheric pressure varies directly with altitude was in determining the height of hills and mountains, thanks to reliable pressure measurement devices. In 1774, Maskelyne was confirming Newton&#x27;s theory of gravitation at and on Schiehallion mountain in Scotland, and he needed to measure elevations on the mountain&#x27;s sides accurately. William Roy, using barometric pressure, was able to confirm Maskelyne&#x27;s height determinations; the agreement was within one meter (3.28 feet). This method became and continues to be useful for survey work and map making.

<doc id="47485" wikidata="Q138" url="?curid=47485" title="King (chess)">
<text>The king (♔, ♚) is the most important piece in the game of chess. It may move to any adjoining square; it may also perform, in tandem with the rook, a special move called &quot;castling&quot;. If a player&#x27;s king is threatened with capture, it is said to be &quot;in check&quot;, and the player must remove the threat of immediately. If this cannot be done, the king is said to be in checkmate, resulting in a loss for that player. A player cannot make any move that places their own king in check. Despite this, the king can become a strong offensive piece in the endgame or, rarely, the middlegame.

In algebraic notation, the king is abbreviated by the letter &quot;K&quot; among English speakers. The white king starts the game on e1; the black king starts on e8. Unlike all other pieces, each player can have only one king, and the kings are never removed from the board during the game.
==Placement and movement== 



The white king starts on e1, on the first to the right of the queen from White&#x27;s perspective. The black king starts on e8, directly across from the white king. Each king starts on a square opposite its own color.

A king can move one square horizontally, vertically, and diagonally unless the square is already occupied by a friendly piece or the move would place the king in check. If the square is occupied by an undefended enemy piece, the king may capture it, removing it from play. Opposing kings may never occupy adjacent squares (see opposition) to give check, as that would put the moving king in check as well. The king can give discovered check, however, by unblocking a bishop, rook, or queen.

===Castling===

The king can make a special move, in conjunction with a rook of the same color, called &quot;castling&quot;. When castling, the king moves two squares horizontally toward one of its rooks, and that rook is placed on the square over which the king crossed.

Castling is permissible under the following conditions:
* Neither the king nor the castling rook have previously moved.
* No squares between the two pieces are occupied.
* The king is not in check.
* None of the squares the king would move across or to are under enemy attack.

Castling with the h-file rook is known as &quot;castling kingside&quot; or &quot;short castling&quot; (denoted 0-0 in algebraic notation), while castling with the a-file rook is known as &quot;castling queenside&quot; or &quot;long castling&quot; (denoted 0-0-0).
==Status in games==

===Check and checkmate===

A king that is under attack is said to be &quot;in check&quot;, and the player in check must immediately remedy the situation. There are three possible ways to remove the king from check:
*The king is moved to an adjacent non-threatened square. A player may not castle to get their king out of check. A king can capture an adjacent enemy piece if that piece is not protected by another enemy piece.
*A piece is interposed between the king and the attacking piece to break the line of threat (not possible when the attacking piece is a knight or pawn, or when in double check).
*The attacking piece is captured (not possible when in double check, unless the king captures).

If none of the three options are available, the player&#x27;s king has been &quot;checkmated&quot;, and the player loses the game.

In casual games, when placing the opponent&#x27;s king in check, it is common to announce &quot;check&quot;, but this is not required by the rules of chess.
===Stalemate===

A stalemate occurs when a player, on their turn, has no legal moves, and the player&#x27;s king is not in check.

If this happens, the king is said to have been stalemated, and the game ends in a draw. A player who has very little or no chance of winning will often, in order to avoid a loss, try to entice the opponent to inadvertently place the player&#x27;s king in stalemate (see swindle).
==Role in gameplay==
In the opening and middlegame, the king will rarely play an active role in the development of an offensive or defensive position, with the notable exception of a king walk. Instead, it will normally castle and seek safety on the edge of the board behind friendly pawns. In the endgame, however, the king emerges to play an active role as an offensive piece, and can assist in the promotion of the player&#x27;s remaining pawns.

It is not meaningful to assign a value to the king relative to the other pieces, as it cannot be captured or exchanged and must be protected at all costs. In this sense, its value could be considered infinite. As an assessment of the king&#x27;s capability as an offensive piece in the endgame, it is often considered to be slightly stronger than a bishop or knight. Emanuel Lasker gave it the value of a knight plus a pawn (i.e. four points on the scale of chess piece relative value), though some other theorists evaluate it closer to three points. It is better at defending friendly pawns than the knight is, and it is better at attacking enemy pawns than the bishop is.
==History==

The king&#x27;s predecessor is the piece of the same name in shatranj. Like the modern king, it is the most important piece in the game and can move to any neighboring square. However, in shatranj, baring the king is a win unless the opponent can do the same immediately afterward; stalemating the king is a win; and castling does not exist.

<text>An atoll () is a ring-shaped island, including a coral rim that encircles a lagoon. There may be coral islands or cays on the rim. Atolls are located in warm tropical or subtropical parts of the oceans and seas where corals can develop. Most of the approximately 440 atolls in the world are in the Pacific Ocean.

Two different, well-cited models, the subsidence model and the antecedent karst model, have been used to explain the development of atolls. According to Charles Darwin&#x27;s subsidence model, the formation of an atoll is explained by the sinking of a volcanic island around which a coral fringing reef has formed. Over geologic time, the volcanic island becomes extinct and eroded as it subsides completely beneath the surface of the ocean. As the volcanic island subsides, the coral fringing reef becomes a barrier reef that is detached from the island. Eventually, reef and the small coral islets on top of it are all that is left of the original island, and a lagoon has taken the place of the former volcano. The lagoon is not the former volcanic crater. For the atoll to persist, the coral reef must be maintained at the sea surface, with coral growth matching any relative change in sea level (sinking of the island or rising oceans).

An alternative model for the origin of atolls is called the antecedent karst model. In the antecedent karst model, the first step in the formation of an atoll is the development of a flat top, mound-like coral reef during the subsidence of an oceanic island of either volcanic or nonvolcanic origin below sea level. Then, when relative sea level drops below the level of the flat surface of coral reef, it is exposed to the atmosphere as a flat topped island which is dissolved by rainfall to form limestone karst. Because of hydrologic properties of this karst, the rate of dissolution of the exposed coral is lowest along its rim and the rate of dissolution increases inward to its maximum at the center of the island. As a result, a saucer shaped island with a raised rim forms. When relative sea level submerges the island again, the rim provides a rocky core on which coral grow again to form the islands of an atoll and the flooded bottom of the saucer forms the lagoon within them.

== Usage ==
The word &quot;atoll&quot; comes from the Dhivehi word (, ). Dhivehi is an Indo-Aryan language spoken in the Maldives. The word&#x27;s first recorded English use was in 1625 as &quot;atollon&quot;. Charles Darwin coined the term in his monograph, &quot;The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs&quot;. He recognized the word&#x27;s indigenous origin and defined it as a &quot;circular group of coral islets&quot;, synonymously with &quot;lagoon-island&quot;.

More modern definitions of &quot;atoll&quot; describe them as &quot;annular reefs enclosing a lagoon in which there are no promontories other than reefs and islets composed of reef detritus&quot; or &quot;in an exclusively morphological sense, [as] a ring-shaped ribbon reef enclosing a lagoon&quot;.

== Distribution and size ==
There are approximately 440 atolls in the world. Most of the world&#x27;s atolls are in the Pacific Ocean (with concentrations in the Caroline Islands, the Coral Sea Islands, the Marshall Islands, the Tuamotu Islands, Kiribati, Tokelau, and Tuvalu) and the Indian Ocean (the Chagos Archipelago, Lakshadweep, the atolls of the Maldives, and the Outer Islands of Seychelles). In addition, Indonesia also has several atolls spread across the archipelago, such as in the Thousand Islands, Taka Bonerate Islands, and atolls in the Raja Ampat Islands. The Atlantic Ocean has no large groups of atolls, other than eight atolls east of Nicaragua that belong to the Colombian department of San Andres and Providencia in the Caribbean.

Reef-building corals will thrive only in warm tropical and subtropical waters of oceans and seas, and therefore atolls are found only in the tropics and subtropics. The northernmost atoll in the world is Kure Atoll at 28°25′ N, along with other atolls of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. The southernmost atolls in the world are Elizabeth Reef at 29°57′ S, and nearby Middleton Reef at 29°27′ S, in the Tasman Sea, both of which are part of the Coral Sea Islands Territory. The next southerly atoll is Ducie Island in the Pitcairn Islands Group, at 24°41′ S. 
The atoll closest to the Equator is Aranuka of Kiribati. Its southern tip is just north of the Equator.

Bermuda is sometimes claimed as the &quot;northernmost atoll&quot; at a latitude of 32°18′ N. At this latitude, coral reefs would not develop without the warming waters of the Gulf Stream. However, Bermuda is termed a &quot;pseudo-atoll&quot; because its general form, while resembling that of an atoll, has a very different origin of formation.

In most cases, the land area of an atoll is very small in comparison to the total area. Atoll islands are low lying, with their elevations less than . Measured by total area, Lifou () is the largest raised coral atoll of the world, followed by Rennell Island (). More sources, however, list Kiritimati as the largest atoll in the world in terms of land area. It is also a raised coral atoll ( land area; according to other sources even ), main lagoon, other lagoons (according to other sources total lagoon size).

The geological formation known as a reef knoll refers to the elevated remains of an ancient atoll within a limestone region, appearing as a hill. The second largest atoll by dry land area is Aldabra, with . Huvadhu Atoll, situated in the southern region of the Maldives, holds the distinction of being the largest atoll based on the sheer number of islands it comprises, with a total of 255 individual islands.

== Formation ==

In 1842, Charles Darwin explained the creation of coral atolls in the southern Pacific Ocean based upon observations made during a five-year voyage aboard HMS Beagle from 1831 to 1836. Darwin&#x27;s explanation suggests that several tropical island types: from high volcanic island, through barrier reef island, to atoll, represented a sequence of gradual subsidence of what started as an oceanic volcano. He reasoned that a fringing coral reef surrounding a volcanic island in the tropical sea will grow upward as the island subsides (sinks), becoming an &quot;almost atoll&quot;, or barrier reef island, as typified by an island such as Aitutaki in the Cook Islands, and Bora Bora and others in the Society Islands. The fringing reef becomes a barrier reef for the reason that the outer part of the reef maintains itself near sea level through biotic growth, while the inner part of the reef falls behind, becoming a lagoon because conditions are less favorable for the coral and calcareous algae responsible for most reef growth. In time, subsidence carries the old volcano below the ocean surface and the barrier reef remains. At this point, the island has become an atoll.

As formulated by J. E. Hoffmeister, F. S. McNeil, E. G. Prudy, and others, the antecedent karst model argues that atolls are Pleistocene features that are the direct result of the interaction between subsidence and preferential karst dissolution that occurred in the interior of flat topped coral reefs during exposure during glacial lowstands of sea level. The elevated rims along an island created by this preferential karst dissolution become the sites of coral growth and islands of atolls when flooded during interglacial highstands.

The research of A. W. Droxler, Stéphan J Jorry and others supports the antecedent karst model as they found that the morphology of modern atolls are independent of any influence of an underlying submerged and buried island and are not rooted to an initial fringing reef/barrier reef attached to a slowly subsiding volcanic edifice. In fact, the Neogene reefs underlying the studied modern atolls overlie and completely bury the subsided island are all non-atoll, flat-topped reefs. In fact, they found that atolls did not form doing the subsidence of an island until MIS-11, Mid-Brunhes, long after the many the former islands had been completely submerged and buried by flat topped reefs during the Neogene.

Atolls are the product of the growth of tropical marine organisms, and so these islands are found only in warm tropical waters. Volcanic islands located beyond the warm water temperature requirements of hermatypic (reef-building) organisms become seamounts as they subside, and are eroded away at the surface. An island that is located where the ocean water temperatures are just sufficiently warm for upward reef growth to keep pace with the rate of subsidence is said to be at the Darwin Point. Islands in colder, more polar regions evolve toward seamounts or guyots; warmer, more equatorial islands evolve toward atolls, for example Kure Atoll. However, ancient atolls during the Mesozoic appear to exhibit different growth and evolution patterns.

Coral atolls are important as sites where dolomitization of calcite occurs. Several models have been proposed for the dolomitization of calcite and aragonite within them. They are the evaporative, seepage-reflux, mixing-zone, burial, and seawater models. Although the origin of replacement dolomites remains problematic and controversial, it is generally accepted that seawater was the source of magnesium for dolomitization and the fluid in which calcite was dolomitized to form the dolomites found within atolls. Various processes have been invoked to drive large amounts of seawater through an atoll in order for dolomitization to occur.

== Investigation by the Royal Society of London==
In 1896, 1897 and 1898, the Royal Society of London carried out drilling on Funafuti atoll in Tuvalu for the purpose of investigating the formation of coral reefs. They wanted to determine whether traces of shallow water organisms could be found at depth in the coral of Pacific atolls. This investigation followed the work on the structure and distribution of coral reefs conducted by Charles Darwin in the Pacific.

The first expedition in 1896 was led by Professor William Johnson Sollas of the University of Oxford. Geologists included Walter George Woolnough and Edgeworth David of the University of Sydney. Professor Edgeworth David led the expedition in 1897. The third expedition in 1898 was led by Alfred Edmund Finckh.

<doc id="47487" wikidata="Q124274" url="?curid=47487" title="Azimuth">
<text>An azimuth (; from ) is the horizontal angle from a cardinal direction, most commonly north, in a local or observer-centric spherical coordinate system. 

Mathematically, the relative position vector from an observer (origin) to a point of interest is projected perpendicularly onto a reference plane (the horizontal plane); the angle between the projected vector and a reference vector on the reference plane is called the azimuth.

When used as a celestial coordinate, the azimuth is the horizontal direction of a star or other astronomical object in the sky. The star is the point of interest, the reference plane is the local area (e.g. a circular area with a 5 km radius at sea level) around an observer on Earth&#x27;s surface, and the reference vector points to true north. The azimuth is the angle between the north vector and the star&#x27;s vector on the horizontal plane.

Azimuth is usually measured in degrees (°), in the positive range 0° to 360° or in the signed range -180° to +180°. The concept is used in navigation, astronomy, engineering, mapping, mining, and ballistics.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;azimuth&quot; is used in all European languages today. It originates from medieval Arabic السموت (&quot;al-sumūt&quot;, pronounced &quot;as-sumūt&quot;), meaning &quot;the directions&quot; (plural of Arabic السمت &quot;al-samt&quot; = &quot;the direction&quot;). The Arabic word entered late medieval Latin in an astronomy context and in particular in the use of the Arabic version of the astrolabe astronomy instrument. Its first recorded use in English is in the 1390s in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on the Astrolabe&quot;. The first known record in any Western language is in Spanish in the 1270s in an astronomy book that was largely derived from Arabic sources, the &quot;Libros del saber de astronomía&quot; commissioned by King Alfonso X of Castile.

==In astronomy==
In the horizontal coordinate system, used in celestial navigation, azimuth is one of the two coordinates. The other is &quot;altitude&quot;, sometimes called elevation above the horizon. 
It is also used for satellite dish installation (see also: sat finder).
In modern astronomy azimuth is nearly always measured from the north.

==In navigation==

 In land navigation, azimuth is usually denoted alpha, &quot;α&quot;, and defined as a horizontal angle measured clockwise from a north base line or &quot;meridian&quot;. &quot;Azimuth&quot; has also been more generally defined as a horizontal angle measured clockwise from any fixed reference plane or easily established base direction line.

Today, the reference plane for an azimuth is typically true north, measured as a 0° azimuth, though other angular units (grad, mil) can be used. Moving clockwise on a 360 degree circle, east has azimuth 90°, south 180°, and west 270°. There are exceptions: some navigation systems use south as the reference vector. Any direction can be the reference vector, as long as it is clearly defined.

Quite commonly, azimuths or compass bearings are stated in a system in which either north or south can be the zero, and the angle may be measured clockwise or anticlockwise from the zero. For example, a bearing might be described as &quot;(from) south, (turn) thirty degrees (toward the) east&quot; (the words in brackets are usually omitted), abbreviated &quot;S30°E&quot;, which is the bearing 30 degrees in the eastward direction from south, i.e. the bearing 150 degrees clockwise from north. The reference direction, stated first, is always north or south, and the turning direction, stated last, is east or west. The directions are chosen so that the angle, stated between them, is positive, between zero and 90 degrees. If the bearing happens to be exactly in the direction of one of the cardinal points, a different notation, e.g. &quot;due east&quot;, is used instead.

===True north-based azimuths===



==In geodesy==


We are standing at latitude formula_1, longitude zero; we want to find the azimuth from our viewpoint to Point 2 at latitude formula_2, longitude &quot;L&quot; (positive eastward). We can get a fair approximation by assuming the Earth is a sphere, in which case the azimuth &quot;α&quot; is given by

:formula_3

A better approximation assumes the Earth is a slightly-squashed sphere (an &quot;oblate spheroid&quot;); &quot;azimuth&quot; then has at least two very slightly different meanings. Normal-section azimuth is the angle measured at our viewpoint by a theodolite whose axis is perpendicular to the surface of the spheroid; geodetic azimuth (or geodesic azimuth) is the angle between north and the ellipsoidal geodesic (the shortest path on the surface of the spheroid from our viewpoint to Point 2). The difference is usually negligible: less than 0.03 arc second for distances less than 100 km.

Normal-section azimuth can be calculated as follows:
: formula_4
where &quot;f&quot; is the flattening and &quot;e&quot; the eccentricity for the chosen spheroid (e.g., for WGS84).
If &quot;φ&quot;1 = 0 then
: formula_5

To calculate the azimuth of the Sun or a star given its declination and hour angle at a specific location, modify the formula for a spherical Earth. Replace &quot;φ&quot;2 with declination and longitude difference with hour angle, and change the sign (since the hour angle is positive westward instead of east).

==In cartography==

The cartographical azimuth or grid azimuth (in decimal degrees) can be calculated when the coordinates of 2 points are known in a flat plane (cartographical coordinates):

:formula_6

Remark that the reference axes are swapped relative to the (counterclockwise) mathematical polar coordinate system and that the azimuth is clockwise relative to the north.
This is the reason why the X and Y axis in the above formula are swapped.
If the azimuth becomes negative, one can always add 360°.

The formula in radians would be slightly easier:
:formula_7

Note the swapped formula_8 in contrast to the normal formula_9 atan2 input order.

The opposite problem occurs when the coordinates (&quot;X&quot;1, &quot;Y&quot;1) of one point, the distance &quot;D&quot;, and the azimuth &quot;α&quot; to another point (&quot;X&quot;2, &quot;Y&quot;2) are known, one can calculate its coordinates:
:formula_10
This is typically used in triangulation and azimuth identification (AzID), especially in radar applications.

===Map projections===
There is a wide variety of azimuthal map projections. They all have the property that directions (the azimuths) from a central point are preserved. Some navigation systems use south as the reference plane. However, any direction can serve as the plane of reference, as long as it is clearly defined for everyone using that system.

If, instead of measuring from and along the horizon, the angles are measured from and along the celestial equator, the angles are called right ascension if referenced to the Vernal Equinox, or hour angle if referenced to the celestial meridian.

===Polar coordinate===
In mathematics, the azimuth angle of a point in cylindrical coordinates or spherical coordinates is the anticlockwise angle between the positive &quot;x&quot;-axis and the projection of the vector onto the &quot;xy&quot;-plane. A special case of an azimuth angle is the angle in polar coordinates of the component of the vector in the &quot;xy&quot;-plane, although this angle is normally measured in radians rather than degrees and denoted by &quot;θ&quot; rather than &quot;φ&quot;.

==Other uses==
For magnetic tape drives, &quot;azimuth&quot; refers to the angle between the tape head(s) and tape.

In sound localization experiments and literature, the &quot;azimuth&quot; refers to the angle the sound source makes compared to the imaginary straight line that is drawn from within the head through the area between the eyes.

An azimuth thruster in shipbuilding is a propeller that can be rotated horizontally.
