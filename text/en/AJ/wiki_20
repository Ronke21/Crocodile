<text>In nuclear strategy, minimal deterrence, also known as minimum deterrence and finite deterrence, is an application of deterrence theory in which a state possesses no more nuclear weapons than is necessary to deter an adversary from attacking. Pure minimal deterrence is a doctrine of no first use, holding that the only mission of nuclear weapons is to deter a nuclear adversary by making the cost of a first strike unacceptably high. To present a credible deterrent, there must be the assurance that any attack would trigger a retaliatory strike. In other words, minimal deterrence requires rejecting a counterforce strategy in favor of pursuing survivable force that can be used in a countervalue second strike.

While the United States and the Soviet Union each developed robust first- and second-strike capabilities during the Cold War, the People&#x27;s Republic of China pursued a doctrine of minimal nuclear deterrence. Assuming that decision-makers make cost-benefit analyses when deciding to use force, China&#x27;s doctrine calls for acquiring a nuclear arsenal only large enough to destroy an adversary&#x27;s &quot;strategic points&quot; in such a way that the expected costs of a first strike outweigh the anticipated benefits. India has also adopted this strategy, which they term Minimum Credible Deterrence.

The &quot;minimum credible deterrence&quot; (also known as N-deterrence) policy of Pakistan is a defence and strategic principle on which the country&#x27;s nuclear weapons program is based. This doctrine is not a part of the nuclear doctrine, which is designed for the use of the atomic weapons in a full-scale declared war if the conditions of the doctrine are surpassed. Instead, the policy of the Minimum Credible Deterrence falls under minimal deterrence as an inverse to the Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD), which is widely regarded as designed to dissuade India from taking any military actions against Pakistan, as it did during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.

Minimal deterrence represents one way of solving the security dilemma and avoiding an arms race. Decision-makers often feel pressured to expand their arsenals when they perceive them to be vulnerable to an adversary&#x27;s first strike, especially when both sides seek to achieve the advantage. Eliminating this perceived vulnerability reduces the incentive to produce more and advanced weapons. For example, the United States’ nuclear force exceeds the requirements of minimal deterrence, and is structured to strike numerous targets in multiple countries and to have the ability to conduct successful counterforce strikes with high confidence. In response to this, China continues to modernize its nuclear forces because its leaders are concerned about the survivability of their arsenal in the face of the United States’ advances in strategic reconnaissance, precision strike, and missile defense.

One disadvantage of minimal deterrence is that it requires an accurate understanding of the level of damage an adversary finds unacceptable, especially if that understanding changes over time so that a previously credible deterrent is no longer credible. A minimal deterrence strategy must also account for the nuclear firepower that would be &quot;lost&quot; or &quot;neutralized&quot; during an adversary&#x27;s counterforce strike. Additionally, a minimal deterrence capability may embolden a state when it confronts a superior nuclear power, as has been observed in the relationship between China and the United States. Finally, while pursuing minimal deterrence during arms negotiations allows states to make reductions without becoming vulnerable, further reductions may be undesirable once minimal deterrence is reached because they will increase a state&#x27;s vulnerability and provide an incentive for an adversary to secretly expand its nuclear arsenal.

<doc id="45955" wikidata="Q5125787" url="?curid=45955" title="Clanging">
<text>Clanging (or clang associations) is a symptom of mental disorders, primarily found in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. This symptom is also referred to as association chaining, and sometimes, glossomania.

Steuber defines it as &quot;repeating chains of words that are associated semantically or phonetically with no relevant context&quot;. This may include compulsive rhyming or alliteration without apparent logical connection between words.

Clanging refers specifically to behavior that is situationally inappropriate. While a poet rhyming is not evidence of mental illness, disorganized speech that impedes the patient&#x27;s ability to communicate is a disorder in itself, often seen in schizophrenia.

==Example==
This can be seen by a section of a 1974 transcript of a patient with schizophrenia:
The speaker makes semantic chain associations on the topic of cats, to the colour of her cat, which (either the topic of colours/patterns, or the topic of pets) leads her to jump from her goldfish to the associated &quot;clown&quot;, a point she reaches via the word &quot;clownfish&quot;. The patient also exhibits a pattern of rhyming and associative clanging: &quot;clown&quot; to &quot;Halloween&quot; (presumably an associative clang) to &quot;down&quot;.

This example highlights how the speaker was distracted by the sound or meaning of her own words, and led herself off the topic, sentence by sentence. In essence, it is a form of derailment driven by self-monitoring.

== As a type of formal thought disorder ==

Formal thought disorders (FTD) are a syndrome with several symptoms, leading to thought, language and communication problems, being a core feature in schizophrenia.

Thought disorders are measured using the Thought, Language and Communication Scale (TLC) developed by Andreasen in 1986. This measures tendencies of 18 subtypes of formal thought disorder (with strong inter-coder reliability) including clanging as a type of FTD.

The TLC scale for FTD sub-types remains the standard and most inclusive – so clanging is officially recognised as a type of FTD.

There has been much debate about whether FTDs are a symptom of thought or language, yet the basis for FTD analysis is the verbal behaviour of the patients. As a result, whether abnormal speech among individuals with schizophrenia is a result of abnormal neurology, abnormal thought or linguistic processes – researchers agree that people with schizophrenia do have abnormal language.

== Occurrences in mental disorders ==

Clanging is associated with the irregular thinking apparent in psychotic mental illnesses (e.g. mania and schizophrenia).

=== In schizophrenia ===
Formal Thought Disorders are one of five characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia according to the DSM-IV-TR. FTD symptoms such as Glossomania are correlated to schizophrenia spectrum disorders and to a family history of schizophrenia. In an analysis of speech in patients with schizophrenia compared to controls, Steuber found that glossomania (association chaining) is a characteristic of speech in schizophrenic patients - despite no significant difference between normal controls and individuals with schizophrenia.

=== In mania/bipolar disorder ===
Gustav Aschaffenburg found that manic individuals generated these &quot;clang-associations&quot; roughly 10–50 times more than non-manic individuals. Aschaffenburg also found that the frequency of these associations increased for all individuals as they became more fatigued.

Andreasen found that when comparing Formal Thought Disorder symptoms between people with schizophrenia and people with Mania, that there was greater reported incidence of clang associations of people with mania.

=== In depression ===
Research investigated by Steuber found no significant difference of glossomania occurrences for patients with schizophrenia compared to patients with depression.

== Disagreements in the literature ==
Being a niche area of symptoms of mental disorders, there have been disagreements in the definitions of clanging, and how it may nor may not fall under the subset of Formal Thought Disorder symptoms in schizophrenia. Steuber argues that although it is a FTD, that it should come under the umbrella of the subtype &#x27;distractibility&#x27;.

Moreover, due to limited research there have been discrepancies in the definition of clanging used: an alternative definition for clanging is: &quot;word selection based on phonemic relatedness, rather than semantic meaning; frequently manifest as rhyming&quot;. Here it is evident that the semantic association chains are not included as part of the definition seen at the start – even though it is the more widely used definition of clanging and glossomania (where the terms are used interchangeably).

== Biological factors ==
Understanding of such language impairments and FTDs take a biological approach.

Candidate genes for such vulnerability of schizophrenia are the FOXP2 (which is linked to a familial language disorder and autism) and dysbindin 1 genes43,44. This distal explanation not only does not explain clanging specifically, but also fails to include other environmental influences on the development of schizophrenia. Moreover, if a person does develop schizophrenia, it does not guarantee they have the symptom of clanging.

Sass and Pienkos 2013 suggest that a more nuanced understanding of structural (neural changes) patterns that occur in a sufferer&#x27;s brain could be important in understanding the disorder. However, more research is required into not only understanding the causes of such symptoms, but how it works.

<doc id="45958" wikidata="Q637802" url="?curid=45958" title="Mutual assured destruction">
<text>Mutual assured destruction (MAD) is a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy which posits that a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by an attacker on a nuclear-armed defender with second-strike capabilities would result in the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender. It is based on the theory of rational deterrence, which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy&#x27;s use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of Nash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm.

The result may be a nuclear peace, in which the presence of nuclear weapons decreases the risk of crisis escalation, since parties will seek to avoid situations that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. Proponents of nuclear peace theory therefore believe that controlled nuclear proliferation may be beneficial for global stability. Critics argue that nuclear proliferation increases the chance of nuclear war through either deliberate or inadvertent use of nuclear weapons, as well as the likelihood of nuclear material falling into the hands of violent non-state actors.

The term &quot;mutual assured destruction&quot;, commonly abbreviated &quot;MAD&quot;, was coined by Donald Brennan, a strategist working in Herman Kahn&#x27;s Hudson Institute in 1962. Brennan conceived the acronym cynically, spelling out the English word &quot;&quot; to argue that holding weapons capable of destroying society was irrational.

==Theory==

Under MAD, each side has enough nuclear weaponry to destroy the other side. Either side, if attacked for any reason by the other, would retaliate with equal or greater force. The expected result is an immediate, irreversible escalation of hostilities resulting in both combatants&#x27; mutual, total, and assured destruction. The doctrine requires that neither side construct shelters on a massive scale. If one side constructed a similar system of shelters, it would violate the MAD doctrine and destabilize the situation, because it would have less to fear from a second strike. The same principle is invoked against missile defense.

The doctrine further assumes that neither side will dare to launch a first strike because the other side would launch on warning (also called fail-deadly) or with surviving forces (a second strike), resulting in unacceptable losses for both parties. The payoff of the MAD doctrine was and still is expected to be a tense but stable global peace. However, many have argued that mutually assured destruction is unable to deter conventional war that could later escalate. Emerging domains of cyber-espionage, proxy-state conflict, and high-speed missiles threaten to circumvent MAD as a deterrent strategy.

The primary application of this doctrine started during the Cold War (1940s to 1991), in which MAD was seen as helping to prevent any direct full-scale conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union while they engaged in smaller proxy wars around the world. MAD was also responsible for the arms race, as both nations struggled to keep nuclear parity, or at least retain second-strike capability. Although the Cold War ended in the early 1990s, the MAD doctrine continues to be applied.

Proponents of MAD as part of the US and USSR strategic doctrine believed that nuclear war could best be prevented if neither side could expect to survive a full-scale nuclear exchange as a functioning state. Since the credibility of the threat is critical to such assurance, each side had to invest substantial capital in their nuclear arsenals even if they were not intended for use. In addition, neither side could be expected or allowed to adequately defend itself against the other&#x27;s nuclear missiles. This led both to the hardening and diversification of nuclear delivery systems (such as nuclear missile silos, ballistic missile submarines, and nuclear bombers kept at fail-safe points) and to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.

This MAD scenario is often referred to as rational nuclear deterrence.

Theory of mutually assured destruction

When the possibility of nuclear warfare between the United States and Soviet Union started to become a reality, theorists began to think that mutual assured destruction would be sufficient to deter the other side from launching a nuclear weapon. Kenneth Waltz, an American political scientist, believed that nuclear forces were in fact useful, but even more useful in the fact that they deterred other nuclear threats from using them, based on mutually assured destruction. The theory of mutually assured destruction being a safe way to deter continued even farther with the thought that nuclear weapons intended on being used for the winning of a war, were impractical, and even considered too dangerous and risky. Even with the Cold War ending in 1991, deterrence from mutually assured destruction is still said to be the safest course to avoid nuclear warfare.

A study published in the &quot;Journal of Conflict Resolution&quot; in 2009 quantitatively evaluated the nuclear peace hypothesis and found support for the existence of the stability-instability paradox. The study determined that nuclear weapons promote strategic stability and prevent large-scale wars but simultaneously allow for more low intensity conflicts. If a nuclear monopoly exists between two states, and one state has nuclear weapons and its opponent does not, there is a greater chance of war. In contrast, if there is mutual nuclear weapon ownership with both states possessing nuclear weapons, the odds of war drop precipitously.

==History==
===Pre-1945===

The concept of MAD had been discussed in the literature for nearly a century before the invention of nuclear weapons. One of the earliest references comes from the English author Wilkie Collins, writing at the time of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870: &quot;I begin to believe in only one civilizing influence—the discovery one of these days of a destructive agent so terrible that War shall mean annihilation and men&#x27;s fears will force them to keep the peace.&quot; The concept was also described in 1863 by Jules Verne in his novel &quot;Paris in the Twentieth Century&quot;, though it was not published until 1994. The book is set in 1960 and describes &quot;the engines of war&quot;, which have become so efficient that war is inconceivable and all countries are at a perpetual stalemate.

MAD has been invoked by more than one weapons inventor. For example, Richard Jordan Gatling patented his namesake Gatling gun in 1862 with the partial intention of illustrating the futility of war. Likewise, after his 1867 invention of dynamite, Alfred Nobel stated that &quot;the day when two army corps can annihilate each other in one second, all civilized nations, it is to be hoped, will recoil from war and discharge their troops.&quot; In 1937, Nikola Tesla published &quot;The Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media&quot;, a treatise concerning charged particle beam weapons. Tesla described his device as a &quot;superweapon that would put an end to all war.&quot;

The March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum, the earliest technical exposition of a practical nuclear weapon, anticipated deterrence as the principal means of combating an enemy with nuclear weapons.

===Early Cold War===

In August 1945, the United States became the first nuclear power after the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Four years later, on August 29, 1949, the Soviet Union detonated its own nuclear device. At the time, both sides lacked the means to effectively use nuclear devices against each other. However, with the development of aircraft like the American Convair B-36 and the Soviet Tupolev Tu-95, both sides were gaining a greater ability to deliver nuclear weapons into the interior of the opposing country. The official policy of the United States became one of &quot;Instant Retaliation&quot;, as coined by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, which called for massive atomic attack against the Soviet Union if they were to invade Europe, regardless of whether it was a conventional or a nuclear attack.

By the time of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, both the United States and the Soviet Union had developed the capability of launching a nuclear-tipped missile from a submerged submarine, which completed the &quot;third leg&quot; of the nuclear triad weapons strategy necessary to fully implement the MAD doctrine. Having a three-branched nuclear capability eliminated the possibility that an enemy could destroy all of a nation&#x27;s nuclear forces in a first-strike attack; this, in turn, ensured the credible threat of a devastating retaliatory strike against the aggressor, increasing a nation&#x27;s nuclear deterrence.

Campbell Craig and Sergey Radchenko argue that Nikita Khrushchev (Soviet leader 1953 to 1964) decided that policies that facilitated nuclear war were too dangerous to the Soviet Union. His approach did not greatly change his foreign policy or military doctrine but is apparent in his determination to choose options that minimized the risk of war.

===Strategic Air Command===

Beginning in 1955, the United States Strategic Air Command (SAC) kept one-third of its bombers on alert, with crews ready to take off within fifteen minutes and fly to designated targets inside the Soviet Union and destroy them with nuclear bombs in the event of a Soviet first-strike attack on the United States. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy increased funding for this program and raised the commitment to 50 percent of SAC aircraft.

During periods of increased tension in the early 1960s, SAC kept part of its B-52 fleet airborne at all times, to allow an extremely fast retaliatory strike against the Soviet Union in the event of a surprise attack on the United States. This program continued until 1969. Between 1954 and 1992, bomber wings had approximately one-third to one-half of their assigned aircraft on quick reaction ground alert and were able to take off within a few minutes. SAC also maintained the National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP, pronounced &quot;kneecap&quot;), also known as &quot;Looking Glass&quot;, which consisted of several EC-135s, one of which was airborne at all times from 1961 through 1990. During the Cuban Missile Crisis the bombers were dispersed to several different airfields, and sixty-five B-52s were airborne at all times.

During the height of the tensions between the US and the USSR in the 1960s, two popular films were made dealing with what could go terribly wrong with the policy of keeping nuclear-bomb-carrying airplanes at the ready: &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964) and &quot;Fail Safe&quot; (1964).
===Retaliation capability (second strike)===
The strategy of MAD was fully declared in the early 1960s, primarily by United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. In McNamara&#x27;s formulation, there was the very real danger that a nation with nuclear weapons could attempt to eliminate another nation&#x27;s retaliatory forces with a surprise, devastating first strike and theoretically &quot;win&quot; a nuclear war relatively unharmed. The true second-strike capability could be achieved only when a nation had a &quot;guaranteed&quot; ability to fully retaliate after a first-strike attack.

The United States had achieved an early form of second-strike capability by fielding continual patrols of strategic nuclear bombers, with a large number of planes always in the air, on their way to or from fail-safe points close to the borders of the Soviet Union. This meant the United States could still retaliate, even after a devastating first-strike attack. The tactic was expensive and problematic because of the high cost of keeping enough planes in the air at all times and the possibility they would be shot down by Soviet anti-aircraft missiles before reaching their targets. In addition, as the idea of a missile gap existing between the US and the Soviet Union developed, there was increasing priority being given to ICBMs over bombers.
It was only with the advent of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, starting with the &quot; George Washington&quot; class in 1959, that a genuine survivable nuclear force became possible and a retaliatory second strike capability guaranteed.

The deployment of fleets of ballistic missile submarines established a guaranteed second-strike capability because of their stealth and by the number fielded by each Cold War adversary—it was highly unlikely that all of them could be targeted and preemptively destroyed (in contrast to, for example, a missile silo with a fixed location that could be targeted during a first strike). Given their long-range, high survivability and ability to carry many medium- and long-range nuclear missiles, submarines were credible and effective means for full-scale retaliation even after a massive first strike.

This deterrence strategy and the program have continued into the 21st century, with nuclear submarines carrying Trident II ballistic missiles as one leg of the US strategic nuclear deterrent and as the sole deterrent of the United Kingdom. The other elements of the US deterrent are intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) on alert in the continental United States, and nuclear-capable bombers. Ballistic missile submarines are also operated by the navies of China, France, India, and Russia.

The US Department of Defense anticipates a continued need for a sea-based strategic nuclear force. The first of the current &quot;Ohio&quot;-class SSBNs are expected to be retired by 2029, meaning that a replacement platform must already be seaworthy by that time. A replacement may cost over $4 billion per unit compared to the USS &quot;Ohio&quot;″s $2 billion. The USN&#x27;s follow-on class of SSBN will be the Columbia class, which began construction in 2021 and enter service in 2031.

=== ABMs threaten MAD ===
In the 1960s both the Soviet Union (A-35 anti-ballistic missile system) and the United States (LIM-49 Nike Zeus) developed anti-ballistic missile systems. Had such systems been able to effectively defend against a retaliatory second strike, MAD would have been undermined. However, multiple scientific studies showed technological and logistical problems in these systems, including the inability to distinguish between real and decoy weapons.

==== MIRVs as counter against ABM ====
The multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle (MIRV) was another weapons system designed specifically to aid with the MAD nuclear deterrence doctrine. With a MIRV payload, one ICBM could hold many separate warheads. MIRVs were first created by the United States in order to counterbalance the Soviet A-35 anti-ballistic missile systems around Moscow. Since each defensive missile could be counted on to destroy only one offensive missile, making each offensive missile have, for example, three warheads (as with early MIRV systems) meant that three times as many defensive missiles were needed for each offensive missile. This made defending against missile attacks more costly and difficult. One of the largest US MIRVed missiles, the LGM-118A Peacekeeper, could hold up to 10 warheads, each with a yield of around —all together, an explosive payload equivalent to 230 Hiroshima-type bombs. The multiple warheads made defense untenable with the available technology, leaving the threat of retaliatory attack as the only viable defensive option. MIRVed land-based ICBMs tend to put a premium on striking first. The START II agreement was proposed to ban this type of weapon, but never entered into force.

In the event of a Soviet conventional attack on Western Europe, NATO planned to use tactical nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union countered this threat by issuing a statement that any use of nuclear weapons (tactical or otherwise) against Soviet forces would be grounds for a full-scale Soviet retaliatory strike (massive retaliation). Thus it was generally assumed that any combat in Europe would end with apocalyptic conclusions.

==== Land-based MIRVed ICBMs threaten MAD ====
MIRVed land-based ICBMs are generally considered suitable for a first strike (inherently counterforce) or a counterforce second strike, due to:
# Their high accuracy (low circular error probable), compared to submarine-launched ballistic missiles which used to be less accurate, and more prone to defects;
# Their fast response time, compared to bombers which are considered too slow;
# Their ability to carry multiple MIRV warheads at once, useful for destroying a whole missile field or several cities with one missile.

Unlike a decapitation strike or a countervalue strike, a counterforce strike might result in a potentially more constrained retaliation. Though the Minuteman III of the mid-1960s was MIRVed with three warheads, heavily MIRVed vehicles threatened to upset the balance; these included the SS-18 Satan which was deployed in 1976, and was considered to threaten Minuteman III silos, which led some neoconservatives to conclude a Soviet first strike was being prepared for. This led to the development of the aforementioned Pershing II, the Trident I and Trident II, as well as the MX missile, and the B-1 Lancer.

MIRVed land-based ICBMs are considered destabilizing because they tend to put a premium on striking first. When a missile is MIRVed, it is able to carry many warheads (up to eight in existing US missiles, limited by New START, though Trident II is capable of carrying up to 12) and deliver them to separate targets. If it is assumed that each side has 100 missiles, with five warheads each, and further that each side has a 95 percent chance of neutralizing the opponent&#x27;s missiles in their silos by firing two warheads at each silo, then the attacking side can reduce the enemy ICBM force from 100 missiles to about five by firing 40 missiles with 200 warheads, and keeping the rest of 60 missiles in reserve. As such, this type of weapon was intended to be banned under the START II agreement; however, the START II agreement was never brought into force, and neither Russia nor the United States ratified the agreement.

===Late Cold War===
The original US MAD doctrine was modified on July 25, 1980, with US President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s adoption of &quot;countervailing strategy&quot; with Presidential Directive 59. According to its architect, Secretary of Defense Harold Brown, &quot;countervailing strategy&quot; stressed that the planned response to a Soviet attack was no longer to bomb Soviet population centers and cities primarily, but first to kill the Soviet leadership, then attack military targets, in the hope of a Soviet surrender before total destruction of the Soviet Union (and the United States). This modified version of MAD was seen as a winnable nuclear war, while still maintaining the possibility of assured destruction for at least one party. This policy was further developed by the Reagan administration with the announcement of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI, nicknamed &quot;Star Wars&quot;), the goal of which was to develop space-based technology to destroy Soviet missiles before they reached the United States.

SDI was criticized by both the Soviets and many of America&#x27;s allies (including Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher) because, were it ever operational and effective, it would have undermined the &quot;assured destruction&quot; required for MAD. If the United States had a guarantee against Soviet nuclear attacks, its critics argued, it would have first-strike capability, which would have been a politically and militarily destabilizing position. Critics further argued that it could trigger a new arms race, this time to develop countermeasures for SDI. Despite its promise of nuclear safety, SDI was described by many of its critics (including Soviet nuclear physicist and later peace activist Andrei Sakharov) as being even more dangerous than MAD because of these political implications. Supporters also argued that SDI could trigger a new arms race, forcing the USSR to spend an increasing proportion of GDP on defense—something which has been claimed to have been an indirect cause of the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev himself in 1983 announced that “the continuation of the S.D.I. program will sweep the world into a new stage of the arms race and would destabilize the strategic situation.”

Proponents of ballistic missile defense (BMD) argue that MAD is exceptionally dangerous in that it essentially offers a single course of action in the event of a nuclear attack: full retaliatory response. The fact that nuclear proliferation has led to an increase in the number of nations in the &quot;nuclear club&quot;, including nations of questionable stability (e.g. North Korea), and that a nuclear nation might be hijacked by a despot or other person or persons who might use nuclear weapons without a sane regard for the consequences, presents a strong case for proponents of BMD who seek a policy which both protect against attack, but also does not require an escalation into what might become global nuclear war. Russia continues to have a strong public distaste for Western BMD initiatives, presumably because proprietary operative BMD systems could exceed their technical and financial resources and therefore degrade their larger military standing and sense of security in a post-MAD environment. Russian refusal to accept invitations to participate in NATO BMD may be indicative of the lack of an alternative to MAD in current Russian war-fighting strategy due to the dilapidation of conventional forces after the breakup of the Soviet Union.

==== Proud Prophet ====
Proud Prophet was a series of war games played out by various American military officials. The simulation revealed MAD made the use of nuclear weapons virtually impossible without total nuclear annihilation, regardless of how nuclear weapons were implemented in war plans. These results essentially ruled out the possibility of a limited nuclear strike, as every time this was attempted, it resulted in a complete expenditure of nuclear weapons by both the United States and USSR. Proud Prophet marked a shift in American strategy; following Proud Prophet, American rhetoric of strategies that involved the use of nuclear weapons dissipated and American war plans were changed to emphasize the use of conventional forces.

==== TTAPS Study ====
In 1983, a group of researchers including Carl Sagan released the TTAPS study (named for the respective initials of the authors), which predicted that the large scale use of nuclear weapons would cause a “nuclear winter”. The study predicted that the debris burned in nuclear bombings would be lifted into the atmosphere and diminish sunlight worldwide, thus reducing world temperatures by “-15° to -25°C”. These findings led to theory that MAD would still occur with many fewer weapons than were possessed by either the United States or USSR at the height of the Cold War. As such, nuclear winter was used as an argument for significant reduction of nuclear weapons since MAD would occur anyway.

===Post-Cold War===

After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation emerged as a sovereign entity encompassing most of the territory of the former USSR. Relations between the United States and Russia were, at least for a time, less tense than they had been with the Soviet Union.

While MAD has become less applicable for the US and Russia, it has been argued as a factor behind Israel&#x27;s acquisition of nuclear weapons. Similarly, diplomats have warned that Japan may be pressured to nuclearize by the presence of North Korean nuclear weapons. The ability to launch a nuclear attack against an enemy city is a relevant deterrent strategy for these powers.

The administration of US President George W. Bush withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in June 2002, claiming that the limited national missile defense system which they proposed to build was designed only to prevent nuclear blackmail by a state with limited nuclear capability and was not planned to alter the nuclear posture between Russia and the United States.

While relations have improved and an intentional nuclear exchange is more unlikely, the decay in Russian nuclear capability in the post–Cold War era may have had an effect on the continued viability of the MAD doctrine. A 2006 article by Keir Lieber and Daryl Press stated that the United States could carry out a nuclear first strike on Russia and would &quot;have a good chance of destroying every Russian bomber base, submarine, and ICBM.&quot; This was attributed to reductions in Russian nuclear stockpiles and the increasing inefficiency and age of that which remains. Lieber and Press argued that the MAD era is coming to an end and that the United States is on the cusp of global nuclear primacy.

However, in a follow-up article in the same publication, others criticized the analysis, including Peter Flory, the US Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy, who began by writing &quot;The essay by Keir Lieber and Daryl Press contains so many errors, on a topic of such gravity, that a Department of Defense response is required to correct the record.&quot; Regarding reductions in Russian stockpiles, another response stated that &quot;a similarly one-sided examination of [reductions in] U.S. forces would have painted a similarly dire portrait&quot;.

A situation in which the United States might actually be expected to carry out a &quot;successful&quot; attack is perceived as a disadvantage for both countries. The strategic balance between the United States and Russia is becoming less stable, and the objective, the technical possibility of a first strike by the United States is increasing. At a time of crisis, this instability could lead to an accidental nuclear war. For example, if Russia feared a US nuclear attack, Moscow might make rash moves (such as putting its forces on alert) that would provoke a US preemptive strike.

An outline of current US nuclear strategy toward both Russia and other nations was published as the document &quot;Essentials of Post–Cold War Deterrence&quot; in 1995.

In November 2020, the US successfully destroyed a dummy ICBM outside the atmosphere with another missile. Bloomberg Opinion writes that this defense ability &quot;ends the era of nuclear stability&quot;.

==== India and Pakistan ====
MAD does not entirely apply to all nuclear-armed rivals. India and Pakistan are an example of this; because of the superiority of conventional Indian armed forces to their Pakistani counterparts, Pakistan may be forced to use their nuclear weapons on invading Indian forces out of desperation regardless of an Indian retaliatory strike. As such, any large-scale attack on Pakistan by India could precipitate the use of nuclear weapons by Pakistan, thus rendering MAD inapplicable. However, MAD is applicable in that it may deter Pakistan from making a “suicidal” nuclear attack rather than a defensive nuclear strike.

==== North Korea ====
Since the emergence of North Korea as a nuclear state, military action has not been an option in handling the instability surrounding North Korea because of their option of nuclear retaliation in response to any conventional attack on them, thus rendering non-nuclear neighboring states such as South Korea and Japan incapable of resolving the destabilizing effect of North Korea via military force. MAD may not apply to the situation in North Korea because the theory relies on rational consideration of the use and consequences of nuclear weapons, which may not be the case for potential North Korean deployment.

==Official policy==
Whether MAD was the officially accepted doctrine of the United States military during the Cold War is largely a matter of interpretation. The United States Air Force, for example, has retrospectively contended that it never advocated MAD as a sole strategy, and that this form of deterrence was seen as one of numerous options in US nuclear policy. Former officers have emphasized that they never felt as limited by the logic of MAD (and were prepared to use nuclear weapons in smaller-scale situations than &quot;assured destruction&quot; allowed), and did not deliberately target civilian cities (though they acknowledge that the result of a &quot;purely military&quot; attack would certainly devastate the cities as well). However, according to a declassified 1959 Strategic Air Command study, US nuclear weapons plans specifically targeted the populations of Beijing, Moscow, Leningrad, East Berlin, and Warsaw for systematic destruction. MAD was implied in several US policies and used in the political rhetoric of leaders in both the United States and the USSR during many periods of the Cold War:

The doctrine of MAD was officially at odds with that of the USSR, which had, contrary to MAD, insisted survival was possible. The Soviets believed they could win not only a strategic nuclear war, which they planned to absorb with their extensive civil defense planning, but also the conventional war that they predicted would follow after their strategic nuclear arsenal had been depleted. Official Soviet policy, though, may have had internal critics towards the end of the Cold War, including some in the USSR&#x27;s own leadership:

Other evidence of this comes from the Soviet minister of defense, Dmitriy Ustinov, who wrote that &quot;A clear appreciation by the Soviet leadership of what a war under contemporary conditions would mean for mankind determines the active position of the USSR.&quot; The Soviet doctrine, although being seen as primarily offensive by Western analysts, fully rejected the possibility of a &quot;limited&quot; nuclear war by 1975.

==Criticism==

Deterrence theory has been criticized by numerous scholars for various reasons. A prominent strain of criticism argues that rational deterrence theory is contradicted by frequent deterrence failures, which may be attributed to misperceptions. Critics have also argued that leaders do not behave in ways that are consistent with the predictions of nuclear deterrence theory. For example, it has been argued that it is inconsistent with the logic of rational deterrence theory that states continue to build nuclear arsenals once they have reached the second-strike threshold. For a more inconsistent example, Mao Zedong urged the socialist camp not to fear nuclear war with the United States since, even if &quot;half of mankind died, the other half would remain while imperialism would be razed to the ground and the whole world would become socialist.&quot;

Additionally, many scholars have advanced philosophical objections against the principles of deterrence theory on purely ethical grounds. Included in this group is Robert L. Holmes who observes that mankind&#x27;s reliance upon a system of preventing war which is based exclusively upon the threat of waging war is inherently irrational and must be considered immoral according to fundamental deontological principles. In addition, he questions whether it can be conclusively demonstrated that such a system has in fact served to prevent warfare in the past and may actually serve to increase the probability of waging war in the future due to its reliance upon the continuous development of new generations of technologically advanced nuclear weapons. 

===Challengeable assumptions===
==== Second-strike capability ====

* A first strike must not be capable of preventing a retaliatory second strike or else mutual destruction is not assured. In this case, a state would have nothing to lose with a first strike or might try to preempt the development of an opponent&#x27;s second-strike capability with a first strike. To avoid this, countries may design their nuclear forces to make decapitation strike almost impossible, by dispersing launchers over wide areas and using a combination of sea-based, air-based, underground, and mobile land-based launchers.
*Another method of ensuring second strike capability is through the use of dead man&#x27;s switch or &quot;fail-deadly:&quot; in the absence of ongoing action from a functional command structure—such as would occur after suffering a successful decapitation strike—an automatic system defaults to launching a nuclear strike upon some target. A particular example is the Soviet (now Russian) Dead Hand system, which has been described as a semi-automatic &quot;version of Dr. Strangelove&#x27;s Doomsday Machine&quot; which, once activated, can launch a second strike without human intervention. The purpose of the Dead Hand system is to ensure a second strike even if Russia were to suffer a decapitation attack, thus maintaining MAD.

==== Perfect detection ====
* No false positives (errors) in the equipment and/or procedures that must identify a launch by the other side. The implication of this is that an accident could lead to a full nuclear exchange. During the Cold War there were several instances of false positives, as in the case of Stanislav Petrov.
* Perfect attribution. If there is a launch from the Sino-Russian border, it could be difficult to distinguish which nation is responsible—both Russia and China have the capability—and, hence, against which nation retaliation should occur. A launch from a nuclear-armed submarine could also be difficult to attribute.

==== Perfect rationality ====
* No rogue commanders will have the ability to corrupt the launch decision process. Such an incident very nearly occurred during the Cuban Missile Crisis when an argument broke out aboard a nuclear-armed submarine cut off from radio communication. The second-in-command, Vasili Arkhipov, refused to launch despite an order from Captain Savitsky to do so.
* All leaders with launch capability seem to care about the survival of their citizens. Winston Churchill is quoted as saying that any strategy will not &quot;cover the case of lunatics or dictators in the mood of Hitler when he found himself in his final dugout.&quot;

==== Inability to defend ====
* No fallout shelter networks of sufficient capacity to protect large segments of the population and/or industry.
* No development of anti-missile technology or deployment of remedial protective gear.

==== Inherent instability ====
Another reason is that deterrence has an inherent instability. As Kenneth Boulding said: &quot;If deterrence were really stable... it would cease to deter.&quot; If decision-makers were perfectly rational, they would never order the largescale use of nuclear weapons, and the credibility of the nuclear threat would be low.

However, that apparent perfect rationality criticism is countered and so is consistent with current deterrence policy. In &quot;Essentials of Post-Cold War Deterrence&quot;, the authors detail an explicit advocation of ambiguity regarding &quot;what is permitted&quot; for other nations and its endorsement of &quot;irrationality&quot; or, more precisely, the perception thereof as an important tool in deterrence and foreign policy. The document claims that the capacity of the United States, in exercising deterrence, would be hurt by portraying US leaders as fully rational and cool-headed: 

==== Terrorism ====
*The threat of foreign and domestic nuclear terrorism has been a criticism of MAD as a defensive strategy. Deterrent strategies are ineffective against those who attack without regard for their life. Furthermore, the doctrine of MAD has been critiqued in regard to terrorism and asymmetrical warfare. Critics contend that a retaliatory strike would not be possible in this case because of the decentralization of terrorist organizations, which may be operating in several countries and dispersed among civilian populations. A misguided retaliatory strike made by the targeted nation could even advance terrorist goals in that a contentious retaliatory strike could drive support for the terrorist cause that instigated the nuclear exchange.

However Robert Gallucci, the president of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, argues that although traditional deterrence is not an effective approach toward terrorist groups bent on causing a nuclear catastrophe, &quot;the United States should instead consider a policy of expanded deterrence, which focuses not solely on the would-be nuclear terrorists but on those states that may deliberately transfer or inadvertently lead nuclear weapons and materials to them. By threatening retaliation against those states, the United States may be able to deter that which it cannot physically prevent.&quot;

Graham Allison makes a similar case and argues that the key to expanded deterrence is coming up with ways of tracing nuclear material to the country that forged the fissile material: &quot;After a nuclear bomb detonates, nuclear forensic cops would collect debris samples and send them to a laboratory for radiological analysis. By identifying unique attributes of the fissile material, including its impurities and contaminants, one could trace the path back to its origin.&quot; The process is analogous to identifying a criminal by fingerprints: &quot;The goal would be twofold: first, to deter leaders of nuclear states from selling weapons to terrorists by holding them accountable for any use of their own weapons; second, to give leaders every incentive to tightly secure their nuclear weapons and materials.&quot;

==== Space weapons ====
* Strategic analysts have criticized the doctrine of MAD for its inability to respond to the proliferation of space weaponry. First, military space systems have unequal dependence across countries. This means that less-dependent countries may find it beneficial to attack a more-dependent country&#x27;s space weapons, which complicates deterrence. This is especially true for countries like North Korea which have extensive ballistic missiles that could strike space-based systems. Even across countries with similar dependence, anti-satellite weapons (ASATs) have the ability to remove the command and control of nuclear weapons. This encourages crisis-instability and pre-emptive nuclear-disabling strikes. Third, there is a risk of asymmetrical challengers. Countries that fall behind in space weapon advancement may turn to using chemical or biological weapons. This may heighten the risk of escalation, bypassing any deterrent effects of nuclear weapons.

==== Entanglements ====
* Cold-war bipolarity no longer is applicable to the global power balance. The complex modern alliance system makes allies and enemies tied to one another. Thus, action by one country to deter another could threaten the safety of a third country. &quot;Security trilemmas&quot; could increase tension during mundane acts of cooperation, complicating MAD. 

==== Emerging hypersonic weapons ====
* Hypersonic ballistic or cruise missiles threaten the retaliatory backbone of mutual assured destruction. The high precision and speed of these weapons may allow for the development of &quot;decapitory&quot; strikes that remove the ability of another nation to have a nuclear response. In addition, the secretive nature of these weapons&#x27; development can make deterrence more asymmetrical.

==== Failure to retaliate ====
* If it was known that a country&#x27;s leader would not resort to nuclear retaliation, adversaries may be emboldened. Edward Teller, a member of the Manhattan Project, echoed these concerns as early as 1985 when he said that &quot;The MAD policy as a deterrent is totally ineffective if it becomes known that in case of attack, we would not retaliate against the aggressor.&quot;

<text>Nuclear strategy involves the development of doctrines and strategies for the production and use of nuclear weapons.

As a sub-branch of military strategy, nuclear strategy attempts to match nuclear weapons as means to political ends. In addition to the actual use of nuclear weapons whether in the battlefield or strategically, a large part of nuclear strategy involves their use as a bargaining tool.

Some of the issues considered within nuclear strategy include:

*Conditions which serve a nation&#x27;s interest to develop nuclear weapons
*Types of nuclear weapons to be developed
*How and when weapons are to be used

Many strategists argue that nuclear strategy differs from other forms of military strategy. The immense and terrifying power of the weapons makes their use, in seeking victory in a traditional military sense, impossible.

Perhaps counterintuitively, an important focus of nuclear strategy has been determining how to prevent and deter their use, a crucial part of mutually assured destruction.

In the context of nuclear proliferation and maintaining the balance of power, states also seek to prevent other states from acquiring nuclear weapons as part of nuclear strategy.

==Nuclear deterrent composition==
The doctrine of mutual assured destruction (MAD) assumes that a nuclear deterrent force must be credible and survivable. That is, each deterrent force must survive a first strike with sufficient capability to effectively destroy the other country in a second strike. Therefore, a first strike would be suicidal for the launching country.

In the late 1940s and 1950s as the Cold War developed, the United States and Soviet Union pursued multiple delivery methods and platforms to deliver nuclear weapons. Three types of platforms proved most successful and are collectively called a &quot;nuclear triad&quot;. These are air-delivered weapons (bombs or missiles), ballistic missile submarines (usually nuclear-powered and called SSBNs), and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), usually deployed in land-based hardened missile silos or on vehicles.

Although not considered part of the deterrent forces, all of the nuclear powers deployed large numbers of tactical nuclear weapons in the Cold War. These could be delivered by virtually all platforms capable of delivering large conventional weapons.

During the 1970s there was growing concern that the combined conventional forces of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact could overwhelm the forces of NATO. It seemed unthinkable to respond to a Soviet/Warsaw Pact incursion into Western Europe with strategic nuclear weapons, inviting a catastrophic exchange. Thus, technologies were developed to greatly reduce collateral damage while being effective against advancing conventional military forces. Some of these were low-yield neutron bombs, which were lethal to tank crews, especially with tanks massed in tight formation, while producing relatively little blast, thermal radiation, or radioactive fallout. Other technologies were so-called &quot;suppressed radiation devices,&quot; which produced mostly blast with little radioactivity, making them much like conventional explosives, but with much more energy.

<text>A cloaking device is a hypothetical or fictional stealth technology that can cause objects, such as spaceships or individuals, to be partially or wholly invisible to parts of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. Fictional cloaking devices have been used as plot devices in various media for many years.

Developments in scientific research show that real-world cloaking devices can obscure objects from at least one wavelength of EM emissions. Scientists already use artificial materials called metamaterials to bend light around an object. However, over the entire spectrum, a cloaked object scatters more than an uncloaked object.

==Fictional origins==

Cloaks with magical powers of invisibility appear from the earliest days of story-telling. Since the advent of modern Science fiction, many variations on the theme with proposed basis in reality have been imagined. &quot;Star Trek&quot; screenwriter Paul Schneider, inspired in part by the 1958 film &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep,&quot; and in part by &quot;The Enemy Below,&quot; which had been released in 1957, imagined cloaking as a space-travel analog of a submarine submerging, and employed it in the 1966 &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Balance of Terror&quot;, in which he introduced the Romulan species, whose space vessels employ cloaking devices extensively. (He likewise predicted, in the same episode, that invisibility, &quot;selective bending of light&quot; as described above, would have an enormous power requirement.) Another &quot;Star Trek&quot; screenwriter, D.C. Fontana, coined the term &quot;cloaking device&quot; for the 1968 episode &quot;The &quot;Enterprise&quot; Incident&quot;, which also featured Romulans.

&quot;Star Trek&quot; placed a limit on use of this device: a space vessel cannot fire weapons, employ defensive shields, or operate transporters while cloaked; thus it must &quot;decloak&quot; to fire—essentially like a submarine needing to &quot;surface&quot; in order to launch torpedoes.

Writers and game designers have since incorporated cloaking devices into many other science-fiction narratives, including &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and &quot;Stargate&quot;.

==Scientific experimentation==
An operational, non-fictional cloaking device might be an extension of the basic technologies used by stealth aircraft, such as radar-absorbing dark paint, optical camouflage, cooling the outer surface to minimize electromagnetic emissions (usually infrared), or other techniques to minimize other EM emissions, and to minimize particle emissions from the object. The use of certain devices to jam and confuse remote sensing devices would greatly aid in this process, but is more properly referred to as &quot;active camouflage&quot;. Alternatively, metamaterials provide the theoretical possibility of making electromagnetic radiation pass freely around the &#x27;cloaked&#x27; object.

===Metamaterial research===

Optical metamaterials have featured in several proposals for invisibility schemes. &quot;Metamaterials&quot; refers to materials that owe their refractive properties to the way they are structured, rather than the substances that compose them. Using transformation optics it is possible to design the optical parameters of a &quot;cloak&quot; so that it guides light around some region, rendering it invisible over a certain band of wavelengths.

These spatially varying optical parameters do not correspond to any natural material, but may be implemented using metamaterials. There are several theories of cloaking, giving rise to different types of invisibility.
In 2014, scientists demonstrated good cloaking performance in murky water, demonstrating that an object shrouded in fog can disappear completely when appropriately coated with metamaterial. This is due to the random scattering of light, such as that which occurs in clouds, fog, milk, frosted glass, etc., combined with the properties of the metamaterial coating. When light is diffused, a thin coat of metamaterial around an object can make it essentially invisible under a range of lighting conditions.

=== Active camouflage ===

&quot;Active camouflage&quot; (or &quot;adaptive camouflage&quot;) is a group of camouflage technologies which would allow an object (usually military in nature) to blend into its surroundings by use of panels or coatings capable of changing color or luminosity. Active camouflage can be seen as having the potential to become the perfection of the art of camouflaging things from visual detection.

&quot;Optical camouflage&quot; is a kind of active camouflage in which one wears a fabric which has an image of the scene directly behind the wearer projected onto it, so that the wearer appears invisible. The drawback to this system is that, when the cloaked wearer moves, a visible distortion is often generated as the &#x27;fabric&#x27; catches up with the object&#x27;s motion. The concept exists for now only in theory and in proof-of-concept prototypes, although many experts consider it technically feasible.

It has been reported that the British Army has tested an invisible tank.

===Plasma stealth===

Plasma at certain density ranges absorbs certain bandwidths of broadband waves, potentially rendering an object invisible. However, generating plasma in air is too expensive and a feasible alternative is generating plasma between thin membranes instead. The Defense Technical Information Center is also following up research on plasma reducing RCS technologies. A plasma cloaking device was patented in 1991.

===Metascreen===
A prototype Metascreen is a claimed cloaking device, which is just few micrometers thick and to a limited extent can hide 3D objects from microwaves in their natural environment, in their natural positions, in all directions, and from all of the observer&#x27;s positions. It was prepared at the University of Texas at Austin by Professor Andrea Alù.

The metascreen consisted of a 66 micrometre thick polycarbonate film supporting an arrangement of 20 micrometer thick copper strips that resembled a fishing net. In the experiment, when the metascreen was hit by 3.6 GHz microwaves, it re-radiated microwaves of the same frequency that were out of phase, thus cancelling out reflections from the object being hidden. The device only cancelled out the scattering of microwaves in the first order. The same researchers published a paper on &quot;plasmonic cloaking&quot; the previous year.

=== Howell/Choi cloaking device ===
University of Rochester physics professor John Howell and graduate student Joseph Choi have announced a scalable cloaking device which uses common optical lenses to achieve visible light cloaking on the macroscopic scale, known as the &quot;Rochester Cloak&quot;. The device consists of a series of four lenses which direct light rays around objects which would otherwise occlude the optical pathway.

===Cloaking in mechanics===
The concepts of cloaking are not limited to optics but can also be transferred to other fields of physics. For example, it was possible to cloak acoustics for certain frequencies as well as touching in mechanics. This renders an object &quot;invisible&quot; to sound or even hides it from touching.

<doc id="45963" wikidata="Q209544" url="?curid=45963" title="Analytic language">
<text>An analytic language is a type of natural language in which a series of root/stem words is accompanied by prepositions, postpositions, particles and modifiers, using affixes very rarely. This is opposed to synthetic languages, which synthesize many concepts into a single word, using affixes regularly. Syntactic roles are assigned to words primarily by word order. For example, by changing the individual words in the Latin phrase &quot;fēl-is pisc-em cēpit&quot; &quot;the cat caught the fish&quot; to &quot;fēl-em pisc-is cēpit&quot; &quot;the fish caught the cat&quot;, the fish becomes the subject, while the cat becomes the object. This transformation is not possible in an analytic language without altering the word order. Typically, analytic languages have a low morpheme-per-word ratio, especially with respect to inflectional morphemes. No natural language, however, is purely analytic or purely synthetic.

==Background==
The term &quot;analytic&quot; is commonly used in a relative rather than an absolute sense. The most prominent and widely used Indo-European analytic language is Modern English, which has lost much of the inflectional morphology that it inherited from Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Germanic and Old English over the centuries and has not gained any new inflectional morphemes in the meantime, which makes it more analytic than most other Indo-European languages.

For example, Proto-Indo-European had much more complex grammatical conjugation, grammatical genders, dual number and inflections for eight or nine cases in its nouns, pronouns, adjectives, numerals, participles, postpositions and determiners, Standard English has lost nearly all of them (except for three modified cases for pronouns) along with genders and dual number and simplified its conjugation.

Latin, German, Greek, and Russian and a majority of the Slavic languages, characterized by free word order, are synthetic languages. Nouns in Russian inflect for at least six cases, most of which descended from Proto-Indo-European cases, whose functions English translates by instead using other strategies like prepositions, verbal voice, word order, and possessive &quot;&quot;.

Modern Hebrew is more analytic than Classical Hebrew mostly with nouns. Classical Hebrew relies heavily on inflectional morphology to convey grammatical relationships, while in Modern Hebrew, there has been a significant reduction of the use of inflectional morphology.

==Isolating language==
A related concept is that of isolating languages, which are those with a low morpheme-per-word ratio (taking into account derivational morphemes as well). Purely isolating languages are by definition analytic and lack inflectional morphemes. However, the reverse is not necessarily true, and a language can have derivational morphemes but lack inflectional morphemes. For example, Mandarin Chinese has many compound words, which gives it a moderately high ratio of morphemes per word, but since it has almost no inflectional affixes at all to convey grammatical relationships, it is a very analytic language.

English is not totally analytic in its nouns since it uses inflections for number (e.g., &quot;one day, three days; one boy, four boys&quot;) and possession (&quot;The boy&#x27;s ball&quot; vis-à-vis &quot;The boy has a ball&quot;). Mandarin Chinese, by contrast, has no inflections on its nouns: compare &#x27;one day&#x27;, &#x27;three days&#x27; (literally &#x27;three day&#x27;); &#x27;one boy&#x27; (lit. &#x27;one [entity of] male child&#x27;), &#x27;four boys&#x27; (lit. &#x27;four [entity of] male child&#x27;). Furthermore English is considered to be weakly inflected and comparatively more analytic than most other Indo-European languages.

Persian has some features of agglutination, making use of prefixes and suffixes attached to the stems of verbs and nouns, thus making it a synthetic language rather than an analytic one. Persian is an SOV language, thus having a head-final phrase structure.

<doc id="45964" wikidata="Q5921" url="?curid=45964" title="Chuck Berry">
<text>Charles Edward Anderson Berry (October 18, 1926 – March 18, 2017) was an American singer, guitarist and songwriter who pioneered rock and roll. Nicknamed the &quot;Father of Rock and Roll&quot;, he refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive with songs such as &quot;Maybellene&quot; (1955), &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; (1956), &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; (1957), and &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; (1958). Writing lyrics that focused on teen life and consumerism, and developing a music style that included guitar solos and showmanship, Berry was a major influence on subsequent rock music.

Born into a middle-class black family in St. Louis, Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. While still a high school student, he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory, where he was held from 1944 to 1947. After his release, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953, influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T-Bone Walker, Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio. His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters, who suggested he contact Leonard Chess, of Chess Records. With Chess, he recorded &quot;Maybellene&quot;—Berry&#x27;s adaptation of the country song &quot;Ida Red&quot;—which sold over a million copies, reaching number one on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s rhythm and blues chart.

By the end of the 1950s, Berry was an established star, with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub, Berry&#x27;s Club Bandstand. He was sentenced to three years in prison in January 1962 for offenses under the Mann Act—he had transported a 14-year-old girl across state lines for the purpose of having sex. After his release in 1963, Berry had several more successful songs, including &quot;No Particular Place to Go&quot;, &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot;, and &quot;Nadine&quot;. However, these did not achieve the same success or lasting impact of his 1950s songs, and by the 1970s he was more in demand as a nostalgia performer, playing his past material with local backup bands of variable quality. In 1972, he reached a new level of achievement when a rendition of &quot;My Ding-a-Ling&quot; became his only record to top the charts. His insistence on being paid in cash led in 1979 to a four-month jail sentence and community service, for tax evasion.

Berry was among the first musicians to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on its opening in 1986; he was cited for having &quot;laid the groundwork for not only a rock and roll sound but a rock and roll stance.&quot; Berry is included in several of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;greatest of all time&quot; lists; he was ranked fifth on its 2004 and 2011 lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and 2nd greatest guitarist of all time in 2023. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll includes three of Berry&#x27;s: &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot;, &quot;Maybellene&quot;, and &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot;. &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; is the only rock-and-roll song included on the Voyager Golden Record.

== Early life ==
Charles Edward Anderson Berry was born on October 18, 1926, in St. Louis, the youngest child of Henry William Berry and Martha Bell Berry (née Banks). He grew up in the north St. Louis neighbourhood known as the Ville, an area where many middle-class people lived. His father, Henry (1895–1987) was a contractor and deacon of a nearby Baptist church; his mother, Martha (1894–1980) was a certified public school principal. Berry&#x27;s upbringing allowed him to pursue his interest in music from an early age. He gave his first public performance in 1941 while still a student at Sumner High School in St. Louis; he was still a student there in 1944, when he was arrested for armed robbery after robbing three shops in Kansas City, Missouri, and then stealing a car at gunpoint with some friends. Berry&#x27;s account in his autobiography is that his car broke down and he flagged down a passing car and stole it at gunpoint with a non-functional pistol. He was convicted and sent to the Intermediate Reformatory for Young Men (now the Algoa Correctional Center) in Jefferson City, Missouri, where he formed a singing quartet and did some boxing. The singing group became competent enough that the authorities allowed it to perform outside the detention facility. Berry was released from the reformatory on his 21st birthday in 1947.

On October 28, 1948, Berry married Themetta &quot;Toddy&quot; Suggs, who gave birth to Darlin Ingrid Berry on October 3, 1950. Chuck supported his family by taking various jobs in St. Louis, working briefly as a factory worker at two automobile assembly plants and as a janitor in the apartment building where he and his wife lived. Afterwards, he trained as a beautician at the Poro College of Cosmetology, founded by Annie Turnbo Malone. He was doing well enough by 1950 to buy a &quot;small three room brick cottage with a bath&quot; on Whittier Street, which is now listed as the Chuck Berry House on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Career==

===1952–1955: Music career beginnings===
By the early 1950s, Chuck Berry was working with local bands in clubs in St. Louis as an extra source of income. He had been playing blues since his teens, and he borrowed both guitar riffs and showmanship techniques from the blues musician T-Bone Walker. He also took guitar lessons from his friend Ira Harris, which laid the foundation for his guitar style. By early 1953, Berry was performing with Johnnie Johnson&#x27;s trio, starting a long-time collaboration with the pianist. The band played blues and ballads as well as country. Berry wrote, &quot;Curiosity provoked me to lay a lot of our country stuff on our predominantly black audience and some of our black audience began whispering &#x27;who is that black hillbilly at the Cosmo?&#x27; After they laughed at me a few times, they began requesting the hillbilly stuff and enjoyed dancing to it.&quot;

In 1954, Berry recorded the tracks &quot;I Hope These Words Will Find You Well&quot; and &quot;Oh, Maria!&quot; with the group Joe Alexander &amp; the Cubans. The songs were released as a single on the Ballad label. Berry&#x27;s showmanship, along with a mix of country tunes and R&amp;B tunes, sung in the style of Nat King Cole set to the music of Muddy Waters brought in a wider audience, particularly affluent white people.

===1955–1962: Signing with Chess: &quot;Maybellene&quot; to &quot;Come On&quot;===
In May 1955, Berry traveled to Chicago, where he met Muddy Waters who suggested he contact Leonard Chess, of Chess Records. Berry thought his blues music would interest Chess, but Chess was a larger fan of Berry&#x27;s take on &quot;Ida Red&quot;. On May 21, 1955, Berry recorded an adaptation of the song &quot;Ida Red&quot;, under the title &quot;Maybellene&quot;, with Johnnie Johnson on the piano, Jerome Green (from Bo Diddley&#x27;s band) on the maracas, Ebby Hardy on the drums and Willie Dixon on the bass. &quot;Maybellene&quot; sold over a million copies, reaching number one on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s rhythm and blues chart and number five on its Best Sellers in Stores chart for September 10, 1955. Berry said, &quot;It came out at the right time when Afro-American music was spilling over into the mainstream pop.&quot;

When Berry first saw a copy of the &quot;Maybellene&quot; record, he was surprised that two other individuals, including DJ Alan Freed had been given writing credit; that would entitle them to some of the royalties. After a court battle, Berry was able to regain full writing credit.

At the end of June 1956, his song &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; reached number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top 100 chart, and Berry toured as one of the &quot;Top Acts of &#x27;56&quot;. He and Carl Perkins became friends. Perkins said that &quot;I knew when I first heard Chuck that he&#x27;d been affected by country music. I respected his writing; his records were very, very great.&quot; In late 1957, Berry took part in Alan Freed&#x27;s &quot;Biggest Show of Stars for 1957&quot;, touring the United States with the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, and others. He was a guest on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Guy Mitchell Show&quot;, singing his hit song &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Music&quot;. The hits continued from 1957 to 1959, with Berry scoring over a dozen chart singles during this period, including the US Top 10 hits &quot;School Days&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot;, &quot;Sweet Little Sixteen&quot;, and &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot;. He appeared in two early rock-and-roll movies: &quot;Rock Rock Rock&quot; (1956), in which he sang &quot;You Can&#x27;t Catch Me&quot;, and &quot;Go, Johnny, Go!&quot; (1959), in which he had a speaking role as himself and performed &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot;, &quot;Memphis, Tennessee&quot;, and &quot;Little Queenie&quot;. His performance of &quot;Sweet Little Sixteen&quot; at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1958 was captured in the motion picture &quot;Jazz on a Summer&#x27;s Day&quot;.

The opening guitar riff of &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; is similar to the one used by Louis Jordan in his &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Just Like a Woman&quot; (1946). Berry acknowledged the debt to Jordan and several sources have indicated that his work was influenced by Jordan in general.

By the end of the 1950s, Berry was a high-profile established star with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had opened a racially integrated St. Louis nightclub, Berry&#x27;s Club Bandstand, and invested in real estate. But in December 1959, he was arrested under the Mann Act after allegations that he had had sex with a 14-year-old Apache waitress, Janice Escalante, whom he had transported across state lines to work as a hatcheck girl at his club. After a two-week trial in March 1960, he was convicted, fined $5,000, and sentenced to five years in prison. He appealed the decision, arguing that the judge&#x27;s comments and attitude were racist and prejudiced the jury against him. The appeal was upheld and a second trial was heard in May and June 1961, resulting in another conviction and a three-year prison sentence. After another appeal failed, Berry served one and one-half years in prison from February 1962 to October 1963. He continued recording and performing during the trials, but his output had slowed as his popularity declined; his last single released before he was imprisoned was &quot;Come On&quot;.

===1963–1969: &quot;Nadine&quot; and move to Mercury===
When Berry was released from prison in 1963, his return to recording and performing was made easier because British invasion bands—notably the Beatles and the Rolling Stones—had sustained interest in his music by releasing cover versions of his songs, and other bands had reworked some of them, such as the Beach Boys&#x27; 1963 hit &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot;, which used the melody of Berry&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Little Sixteen&quot;. In 1964 and 1965 Berry released eight singles, including three that were commercially successful, reaching the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 100: &quot;No Particular Place to Go&quot; (a humorous reworking of &quot;School Days&quot;, concerning the introduction of seat belts in cars), &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot;, and the rocking &quot;Nadine&quot;. Between 1966 and 1969, Berry released five albums for Mercury Records, including his second live album (and first recorded entirely onstage), &quot;Live at Fillmore Auditorium&quot;; for the live album he was backed by the Steve Miller Band.

Although this period was not a successful one for studio work, Berry was still a top concert draw. In May 1964, he had made a successful tour of the UK, but when he returned in January 1965, his behavior was erratic and moody, and his touring style of using unrehearsed local backing bands and a strict nonnegotiable contract was earning him a reputation as a difficult and unexciting performer. He also played at large events in North America, such as the Schaefer Music Festival, in New York City&#x27;s Central Park in July 1969, and the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival in October.

===1970–1979: Back to Chess: &quot;My Ding-a-Ling&quot; to White House concert===
Berry returned to Chess from 1970 to 1973. There were no hit singles from the 1970 album &quot;Back Home&quot;, but in 1972, Chess released a live recording of &quot;My Ding-a-Ling&quot;, a novelty song that he had recorded in a different version as &quot;My Tambourine&quot; on his 1968 LP &quot;From St. Louie to Frisco&quot;. The track became his only number-one single. A live recording of &quot;Reelin&#x27; and Rockin&#x27;&quot;, issued as a follow-up single in the same year, was his last Top 40 hit in both the US and the UK. Both singles were included on the part-live, part-studio album &quot;The London Chuck Berry Sessions&quot; (other albums of London sessions were recorded by Chess&#x27;s mainstay artists Muddy Waters and Howlin&#x27; Wolf). Berry&#x27;s second tenure with Chess ended with the 1975 album &quot;Chuck Berry&quot;, after which he did not make a studio record until &quot;Rockit&quot; for Atco Records in 1979, which would be his last studio album for 38 years.

In the 1970s, Berry toured on the strength of his earlier successes. He was on the road for many years, carrying only his Gibson guitar, confident that he could hire a band that already knew his music no matter where he went. AllMusic said that in this period his &quot;live performances became increasingly erratic, ... working with terrible backup bands and turning in sloppy, out-of-tune performances&quot; which &quot;tarnished his reputation with younger fans and oldtimers&quot; alike. In March 1972, he was filmed, at the BBC Television Theatre in Shepherds Bush, for &quot;Chuck Berry in Concert&quot;, part of a 60-date tour backed by the band Rocking Horse. Among the many bandleaders performing a backup role with Berry in the 1970s, were Bruce Springsteen and Steve Miller when each was just starting his career. (Springsteen related in the documentary film &quot;Hail! Hail! Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; that Berry did not give the band a set list and expected the musicians to follow his lead after each guitar intro. Berry did not speak to the band after the show. Nevertheless, Springsteen backed Berry again when he appeared at the concert for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995.) At the request of Jimmy Carter, Berry performed at the White House on June 1, 1979.

Berry&#x27;s touring style, traveling the &quot;oldies&quot; circuit in the 1970s (often being paid in cash by local promoters), added ammunition to the Internal Revenue Service&#x27;s accusations that Berry had evaded paying income taxes. Facing criminal sanction for the third time, Berry pleaded guilty to evading nearly $110,000 in federal income tax owed on his 1973 earnings. Newspaper reports in 1979 put his 1973 joint income (with his wife) at $374,982. He was sentenced to four months in prison and 1,000 hours of community service—performing benefit concerts—in 1979.

===1980–2017: Last years on the road===

Berry continued to play 70 to 100 one-nighters per year in the 1980s, still traveling solo and requiring a local band to back him at each stop. In 1986, Taylor Hackford made a documentary film, &quot;Hail! Hail! Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, of a celebration concert for Berry&#x27;s sixtieth birthday, organized by Keith Richards. Eric Clapton, Etta James, Julian Lennon, Robert Cray, and Linda Ronstadt, among others, appeared with Berry on stage and in the film. During the concert, Berry played a Gibson ES-355, the luxury version of the ES-335 that he favored on his 1970s tours. Richards played a black Fender Telecaster Custom, Cray a Fender Stratocaster and Clapton a Gibson ES 350T, the same model that Berry used on his early recordings.

In the late 1980s, Berry bought the Southern Air, a restaurant in Wentzville, Missouri. In 1982, Berry performed a television special at The Roxy in West Hollywood with Tina Turner as his special guest. The concert was released a year later on home video. In November 2000, Berry faced legal issues when he was sued by his former pianist Johnnie Johnson who claimed that he had co-written over 50 songs, including &quot;No Particular Place to Go&quot;, &quot;Sweet Little Sixteen&quot; and &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot;, that credit Berry alone. The case was dismissed when the judge ruled that too much time had passed since the songs were written.
In 2008, Berry toured Europe, with stops in Sweden, Norway, Finland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Ireland, Switzerland, Poland, and Spain. In mid-2008, he played at the Virgin Festival in Baltimore. During a concert on New Year&#x27;s Day 2011 in Chicago, Berry, suffering from exhaustion, passed out and had to be helped off stage.

Berry lived in Ladue, Missouri, approximately west of St. Louis. He also had a home at &quot;Berry Park&quot;, near Wentzville where he lived part-time since the 1950s and was the home in which he died. The home with the guitar-shaped swimming pool, is seen in scenes near the end of the film &quot;Hail! Hail! Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;.
When Berry performed he often required payment up front in a paper bag which he transferred to an attaché case, PBS on &quot;In Their Own Words&quot;, relates. He gave interviews where he talked about having been ripped off during his early career. Thus he protected his own interests.

He regularly performed one Wednesday each month at Blueberry Hill, a restaurant and bar located in the Delmar Loop neighborhood of St. Louis, from 1996 to 2014. Berry announced on his 90th birthday that his first new studio album since &quot;Rockit&quot; in 1979, entitled &quot;Chuck&quot;, would be released in 2017. His first new record in 38 years, it includes his children, Charles Berry Jr. and Ingrid, on guitar and harmonica with songs &quot;covering the spectrum from hard-driving rockers to soulful thought-provoking time capsules of a life&#x27;s work&quot; and dedicated to his wife Toddy.

==Death and funeral==
On March 18, 2017, Berry was found unresponsive at his home near Wentzville. Emergency workers called to the scene were unable to revive him, and he was pronounced dead by his personal physician. TMZ posted an audio recording on its website in which a 911 operator can be heard responding to a reported cardiac arrest at Berry&#x27;s home.

Berry&#x27;s funeral was held on April 9, 2017, at The Pageant, in Berry&#x27;s home town of St. Louis. He was remembered with a public viewing by family, friends, and fans in The Pageant. He was viewed with his cherry-red Gibson ES-335 guitar bolted to the inside lid of the coffin and with flower arrangements that included one sent by the Rolling Stones in the shape of a guitar. Afterwards a private service was held in the club celebrating Berry&#x27;s life and musical career, with the Berry family inviting 300 members of the public into the service. Gene Simmons of Kiss gave an impromptu, unadvertised eulogy at the service, while Little Richard was scheduled to lead the funeral procession but was unable to attend due to an illness. The night before, many St. Louis area bars held a mass toast at 10 pm in Berry&#x27;s honor.

One of Berry&#x27;s attorneys estimated that his estate was worth $50 million, including $17 million in music rights. Berry&#x27;s music publishing accounted for $13 million of the estate&#x27;s value. The Berry estate owned roughly half of his songwriting credits (mostly from his later career), while BMG Rights Management controlled the other half; most of Berry&#x27;s recordings are currently owned by Universal Music Group. In September 2017, Dualtone, the label which released Berry&#x27;s final album, &quot;Chuck&quot;, agreed to publish all his compositions in the United States.

Berry is interred in a mausoleum in Bellerive Gardens Cemetery in St. Louis.

==Controversies==
In 1987, Berry was charged with assaulting a woman at New York&#x27;s Gramercy Park Hotel. He was accused of causing &quot;lacerations of the mouth, requiring five stitches, two loose teeth, [and] contusions of the face.&quot; He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of harassment and paid a $250 fine. In 1990, he was sued by several women who claimed that he had installed a video camera in the bathroom of his restaurant. Berry claimed that he had the camera installed to catch a worker who was suspected of stealing from the restaurant. Although his guilt was never proven in court, Berry opted for a class action settlement. One of his biographers, Bruce Pegg, estimated that it cost Berry over $1.2 million plus legal fees. His lawyers said he had been the victim of a conspiracy to profit from his wealth.

Reportedly, according to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, a police raid on his house found intimate videotapes of women. Also found in the raid were 62 grams of marijuana. Felony drug charges were filed and Berry agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor possession of marijuana. He was given a six-month suspended jail sentence, placed on two years unsupervised probation, and was ordered to donate $5,000 to a local hospital.

A pioneer of rock and roll, Berry was a significant influence on the development of both the music and the attitude associated with the rock music lifestyle. With songs such as &quot;Maybellene&quot; (1955), &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; (1956), &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; (1957) and &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; (1958), Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics successfully aimed to appeal to the early teenage market by using graphic and humorous descriptions of teen dances, fast cars, high school life, and consumer culture, and utilizing guitar solos and showmanship that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music. Thus Berry, the songwriter, according to critic Jon Pareles, invented rock as &quot;a music of teenage wishes fulfilled and good times (even with cops in pursuit).&quot; Berry contributed three things to rock music: an irresistible swagger, a focus on the guitar riff as the primary melodic element and an emphasis on songwriting as storytelling. His records are a rich storehouse of the essential lyrical, showmanship and musical components of rock and roll. In addition to the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, a large number of significant popular-music performers have recorded Berry&#x27;s songs. Although not technically accomplished, his guitar style is distinctive—he incorporated electronic effects to mimic the sound of bottleneck blues guitarists and drew on the influence of guitar players such as Carl Hogan, and T-Bone Walker to produce a clear and exciting sound that many later guitarists would acknowledge as an influence in their own style. Berry&#x27;s showmanship has been influential on other rock guitarists, particularly his one-legged hop routine, and the &quot;duck walk&quot;, which he first used as a child when he walked &quot;stooping with full-bended knees, but with my back and head vertical&quot; under a table to retrieve a ball and his family found it entertaining; he used it when &quot;performing in New York for the first time and some journalist branded it the duck walk.&quot;

On July 29, 2011, Berry was honored in a dedication of an eight-foot, in-motion Chuck Berry Statue in the Delmar Loop in St. Louis right across the street from Blueberry Hill. Berry said, &quot;It&#x27;s glorious—I do appreciate it to the highest, no doubt about it. That sort of honor is seldom given out. But I don&#x27;t deserve it.&quot;

Rock critic Robert Christgau considers Berry &quot;the greatest of the rock and rollers&quot;, and John Lennon said, &quot;if you tried to give rock and roll another name, you might call it &#x27;Chuck Berry&#x27;.&quot; Ted Nugent said, &quot;If you don&#x27;t know every Chuck Berry lick, you can&#x27;t play rock guitar.&quot; Bob Dylan called Berry &quot;the Shakespeare of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;. Bruce Springsteen tweeted, &quot;Chuck Berry was rock&#x27;s greatest practitioner, guitarist, and the greatest pure rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll writer who ever lived.&quot; When asked what caused the explosion of the popularity of rock &#x27;n roll which took place in the 1950s, with him and a handful of others, mainly him, Berry said, &quot;Well, actually they begin to listen to it, you see, because certain stations played certain music. The music that we, the blacks, played, the cultures were so far apart, we would have to have a play station in order to play it. The cultures begin to come together, and you begin to see one another&#x27;s vein of life, then the music came together.&quot;

Among the honors Berry received were the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1984 and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2000. He was ranked seventh on &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2009 list of the 10 best electric guitar players of all time. On May 14, 2002, he was honored as one of the first BMI Icons at the 50th annual BMI Pop Awards. He was presented the award along with BMI affiliates Bo Diddley and Little Richard. In August 2014, Berry was made a laureate of the Polar Music Prize.

Berry is included in several of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Greatest of All Time&quot; lists. In September 2003, the magazine ranked him number 6 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;. In November his compilation album &quot;The Great Twenty-Eight&quot; was ranked 21st in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In March 2004, Berry was ranked fifth on the list of &quot;The Immortals– The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. Joe Perry wrote in tribute, &quot;As a songwriter, Chuck Berry is like the Ernest Hemingway of rock &amp; roll. He gets right to the point. He tells a story in short sentences. You get a great picture in your mind of what&#x27;s going on, in a very short amount of space, in well-picked words... kids today are playing the same three chords, trying to play in that same style. Turn the guitars up, and it&#x27;s punk rock. It&#x27;s the Ramones and the Sex Pistols. I hear it in the White Stripes, too. People will always cover Chuck Berry songs. When bands go do their homework, they will have to listen to Chuck Berry. If you want to learn about rock &amp; roll, if you want to play rock &amp; roll, you have to start there.&quot; In December 2004, six of his songs were included in &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;: &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; (#7), &quot;Maybellene&quot; (#18), &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; (#97), &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; (#128), &quot;Sweet Little Sixteen&quot; (#272) and &quot;Brown Eyed Handsome Man&quot; (#374). In June 2008, his song &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; was ranked first in the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time&quot;. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Berry at number 96 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

The journalist Chuck Klosterman has argued that in 300 years Berry will still be remembered as the rock musician who most closely captured the essence of rock and roll. &quot;Time&quot; magazine said, &quot;There was no one like Elvis. But there was &#x27;definitely&#x27; no one like Chuck Berry.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called him &quot;the father of rock &amp; roll&quot; who &quot;gave the music its sound and its attitude, even as he battled racism—and his own misdeeds—all the way,&quot; reporting that Leonard Cohen said, &quot;All of us are footnotes to the words of Chuck Berry.&quot; Kevin Strait, curator of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, DC, said that Berry is &quot;one of the primary sonic architects of rock and roll.&quot;

According to Cleveland.com&#x27;s Troy L. Smith, &quot;Chuck Berry didn&#x27;t invent rock and roll all by his lonesome. But he was the man who took rhythm and blues and transformed it into a new genre that would ever change popular music. Songs like &#x27;Maybellene,&#x27; &#x27;Johnny B. Goode,&#x27; &#x27;Roll Over Beethoven&#x27; and &#x27;Rock and Roll Music&#x27; would showcase the core elements of what rock and roll would become. The sound, the format and the style were built on the music Berry created. To some extent, everyone who followed was a copycat.&quot;

In 2020, the International Astronomical Union named a small crater on Mercury after Berry.

<doc id="45966" wikidata="Q2520989" url="?curid=45966" title="No first use">
<text>In nuclear ethics and deterrence theory, no first use (NFU) refers to a type of pledge or policy wherein a nuclear power formally refrains from the use of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in warfare, except for as a second strike in retaliation to an attack by an enemy power using WMD. Such a pledge would allow for a unique state of affairs in which a given nuclear power can be engaged in a conflict of conventional weaponry while it formally forswears any of the strategic advantages of nuclear weapons, provided the enemy power does not possess or utilize any such weapons of their own. The concept is primarily invoked in reference to nuclear mutually assured destruction but has also been applied to chemical and biological warfare, as is the case of the official WMD policy of India.

China and India are currently the only two nuclear powers to formally maintain a no first use policy, adopting pledges in 1964 and 1998 respectively. Both NATO and a number of its member states have repeatedly rejected calls for adopting a NFU policy, as during the lifetime of the Soviet Union a pre-emptive nuclear strike was commonly argued as a key option to afford NATO a credible nuclear deterrent, compensating for the overwhelming conventional weapon superiority enjoyed by the Soviet Army in Eurasia. In 1993, Russia dropped a pledge against first use of nuclear weapons made in 1982 by Leonid Brezhnev, with Russian military doctrine later stating in 2000 that Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons &quot;in response to a large-scale conventional aggression&quot;. Pakistan has also made similar statements, largely in reference to intermittent military tensions with India. North Korea has publicly pledged to refrain from a preemptive nuclear strike, while threatening retaliation up to and including WMD against conventional aggression.
==Countries pledging no-first-use==
===China===
===India===
India first adopted a &quot;no first use&quot; policy after its second series of nuclear tests, Pokhran-II, in 1998. In August 1999, the Indian government released a draft of the doctrine which asserts that nuclear weapons are solely for deterrence and that India will pursue a policy of &quot;retaliation only&quot;. The document also maintains that India &quot;will not be the first to initiate a nuclear first strike, but will respond with punitive retaliation should deterrence fail&quot; and that decisions to authorise the use of nuclear weapons would be made by the prime minister or his &quot;designated successor(s)&quot;. According to the National Research Development Corporation, despite the escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan in 2001–2002, India remained committed to its nuclear no-first-use policy. India is in the process of developing a nuclear doctrine based on &quot;credible minimum deterrence&quot;.

In a speech at the National Defence College by India&#x27;s National Security Advisor, Shivshankar Menon, on October 21, 2010, the wording was changed from &quot;no first use&quot; to &quot;no first use against non-nuclear weapon states&quot;, but some argued that it was not a substantive change but &quot;an innocent typographical or lexical error in the text of the speech&quot;. In April 2013, Shyam Saran, convener of the National Security Advisory Board, affirmed that regardless of the size of a nuclear attack against India, be it a tactical nuclear weapon or a strategic nuclear weapon, India would retaliate massively. That was in response to reports that Pakistan had developed a tactical battlefield nuclear weapon in an attempt to supposedly nullify an Indian &quot;no first use&quot; retaliatory doctrine. In April 2014, before the general elections, Prime Minister Modi reiterated commitment to a no-first-use policy. On November 10, 2016, the Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar questioned the no-first-use policy of India, and asked why should India &quot;bind&quot; itself when it is a &quot;responsible nuclear power&quot;. He clarified that it was his personal opinion.

Indian defence minister Rajnath Singh, speaking on the anniversary of the death of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on August 16, 2019, said that India&#x27;s no-first-use policy might change depending upon the &quot;circumstances&quot;. Vajpayee&#x27;s government conducted the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998.

==Countries against no-first-use policy==

Pakistan, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France say that they will use nuclear weapons against either nuclear or non-nuclear states only in the case of invasion or other attack against their territory or against one of their allies. Historically, NATO military strategy, taking into account the numerical superiority of Warsaw Pact conventional forces, assumed that tactical nuclear weapons would have to be used to defeat a Soviet invasion.

At the 16th NATO summit in April 1999, Germany proposed that NATO adopt a no-first-use policy, but the proposal was rejected. In 2022, leaders of the five NPT nuclear-weapon states issued a statement on prevention of nuclear war, saying &quot;We affirm that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.&quot;

=== Soviet Union/Russia ===
In its final years, the Soviet Union adopted a formal no-first-use in 1982 when Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko read out at the United Nations a pledge by General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev not to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike. However, this pledge was not taken seriously, and later leaked Soviet Armed Forces documents confirmed that the military had plans for a pre-emptive nuclear strike and considered launching one during the Able Archer 83 crisis. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation formally reversed this policy in 1993 due to the weakness of the Russian Armed Forces in the post-Soviet era. Russia describes its entire military doctrine as defensive military doctrine.
With regard to nuclear weapons specifically, Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons:
* in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it or its allies, and also
* in case of aggression against Russia with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is threatened.
The military doctrine of 2014 did not depart from this stance. The 2020 Presidential Executive Order on Nuclear Deterrence in Article 4 uses the following wording: &quot;deterrence of a potential adversary from aggression against the Russian Federation and/or its allies. In the event of a military conflict, this Policy provides for the prevention of an escalation of military actions and their termination on conditions that are acceptable for the Russian Federation and/or its allies.&quot; This has been interpreted as describing non-nuclear scenarios where Russia might use nuclear weapons to achieve its military goals. During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, observers expressed concern that Russia would preemptively use tactical nuclear weapons after President Vladimir Putin announced the mobilization of Russian nuclear forces to &quot;combat-ready&quot; status. In December 2022, Putin claimed that Russia would not be the first to use nuclear weapons or the second, and that &quot;Russian nuclear doctrine is premised on self-defense.&quot;

Russia and China do maintain a mutual agreement to have a no first use policy which was developed under the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation. Under the second paragraph of article two, China and Russia agreed that &quot;The contracting parties reaffirm their commitment that they will not be the first to use nuclear weapons against each other nor target strategic nuclear missiles against each other.&quot;

===United Kingdom===
In March 2002, the Secretary of State for Defence Geoff Hoon stated that the UK was prepared to use nuclear weapons against &quot;rogue states&quot; such as Ba&#x27;athist Iraq if they ever used &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; against British Armed Forces troops in the field. This policy was restated in February 2003 and again under the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010. In April 2017 Defence Secretary Michael Fallon confirmed that the UK would use nuclear weapons in a &quot;pre-emptive initial strike&quot; in &quot;the most extreme circumstances&quot;. Fallon stated in a parliamentary answer that the UK has neither a &#x27;first use&#x27; or &#x27;no first use&#x27; in its nuclear weapon policy so that its adversaries would not know when the UK would launch nuclear strikes.

===United States===
The United States has refused to adopt a no first use policy and says that it &quot;reserves the right to use&quot; nuclear weapons first in the case of conflict. This was partially to provide a nuclear umbrella over its allies in NATO as a deterrent against a conventional Warsaw Pact attack during the Cold War, and NATO continues to oppose a no-first-use policy. Not only did the United States and NATO refuse to adopt a no first use policy, but until 1967 they maintained a nuclear doctrine of &quot;massive retaliation&quot; in which nuclear weapons would explicitly be used to defend North America or Western Europe against a conventional attack. Although this strategy was revised, they both reserved the right to use nuclear weapons first under the new doctrine of &quot;flexible response&quot;.

Released on April 6, 2010, the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review reduces the role of U.S. nuclear weapons: &quot;The fundamental role of U.S. nuclear weapons, which will continue as long as nuclear weapons exist, is to deter nuclear attack on the United States, our allies, and partners.&quot; The U.S. doctrine also includes the following assurance to other states: &quot;The United States will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states that are party to the NPT and in compliance with their nuclear non-proliferation obligations.&quot;

For states eligible for the assurance, the United States would not use nuclear weapons in response to a chemical or biological attack but states that those responsible for such an attack would be held accountable and would face the prospect of a devastating conventional military response. Even for states that are not eligible for the assurance, the United States would consider the use of nuclear weapons only in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States or its allies and partners. The Nuclear Posture Review also notes, &quot;It is in the U.S. interest and that of all other nations that the nearly 65-year record of nuclear non-use be extended forever.&quot;

This supersedes the doctrine of the George W. Bush administration set forth in &quot;Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations&quot; and written under the direction of Air Force General Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That now superseded doctrine envisioned commanders requesting presidential approval to use nuclear weapons to preempt an attack by a nation or a terrorist group using weapons of mass destruction. The now superseded doctrine also included the option of using nuclear weapons to destroy known enemy stockpiles of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons.

In August 2016, President Barack Obama reportedly considered adopting a no first use policy. Obama was persuaded by several Cabinet officials such as Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, and Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz that &#x27;no first use&#x27; would rattle U.S. allies and decided not to take up the policy.

During the 2017–2018 North Korea crisis, there were efforts to either require congressional approval for a pre-emptive nuclear strike or to ban it altogether and impose an NFU policy. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee chaired by Bob Corker held its first meeting on the President&#x27;s authority to use nuclear weapons in 41 years. Since 2017, Ted Lieu, Ed Markey, Elizabeth Warren, and Adam Smith all introduced bills to limit the President&#x27;s ability to order a pre-emptive nuclear strike. Calls to limit the President of the United States&#x27; ability to unilaterally launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike increased after the January 6 United States Capitol attack. During the 2020 United States presidential election the eventual victor Joe Biden expressed support for a &quot;sole purpose&quot; declaration confirming that the only use of U.S. nuclear weapons would be as a deterrent, although this is distinct from a &quot;no first use&quot; declaration identifying that the United States would not unilaterally use them.

===Pakistan===

Pakistan&#x27;s Foreign Minister Shamshad Ahmad warned that if Pakistan is ever invaded or attacked, it will use &quot;any weapon in its arsenal&quot; to defend itself.

Pakistan refuses to adopt a no first use doctrine and indicates that it would launch nuclear weapons even if the other side did not use such weapons first. Pakistan&#x27;s asymmetric nuclear posture has significant influence on India&#x27;s ability to retaliate, as shown in 2001 and 2008 crises, when non-state actors carried out deadly terrorist attacks on India, only to be met with a relatively subdued response from India. A military spokesperson stated that &quot;Pakistan&#x27;s threat of nuclear first-use deterred India from seriously considering conventional military strikes.&quot;

Pakistan&#x27;s National Security Advisor Sartaj Aziz defended the policy of first use. Aziz stated that Pakistan&#x27;s first use doctrine is entirely deterrent in nature. He explained that it was effective after the 2001 Indian Parliament attack and argued that if Pakistan had a no first use policy, there would have been a major war between the two countries.

===North Korea===

North Korea&#x27;s stated policy position is that nuclear weapons &quot;will never be abused or used as a means for preemptive strike&quot;, but if there is an &quot;attempt to have recourse to military force against us&quot; North Korea may use their &quot;most powerful offensive strength in advance to punish them&quot;.

==Israel==
Although Israel does not officially confirm or deny having nuclear weapons, the country is widely believed to be in possession of them. Its continued ambiguous stance puts it in a difficult position since to issue a statement pledging &#x27;no first use&#x27; would confirm their possession of nuclear weapons.

Israel has said that it &quot;would not be the first country in the Middle East to formally introduce nuclear weapons into the region&quot;.

If Israel&#x27;s very existence is threatened, some speculate that Israel would use a &quot;Samson Option&quot;, a &quot;last resort&quot; deterrence strategy of massive retaliation with nuclear weapons, should the State of Israel be substantially damaged and/or near destruction. According to Israeli historian Avner Cohen, Israel&#x27;s policy on nuclear weapons, which was set down in 1966, revolves around four &quot;red lines&quot; which could lead to an Israeli nuclear response:

* A successful military penetration into populated areas within Israel&#x27;s borders.
* The destruction of the Israeli Air Force.
* Israeli cities being subjected to massive and devastating aerial bombardment, chemical attacks, or biological attacks.
* The use of nuclear weapons against Israel.

==Rationale==

Debates in the international community on strategic no-first-use of nuclear weapons include legal, ethical, moral and political arguments from intergovernmental organizations, regional blocs, non-governmental organizations and civil society actors as well as countries. In 2023, former IPPNW program director John Loretz wrote: &quot;With the risk of nuclear war greater than at any time since the Cold War of the 1980s (Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists 2023)—exacerbated even further by the prolonged war in Ukraine—it comes as no surprise that academics, diplomats, and nuclear strategists are focusing anew on risk reduction proposals. One idea that has been in circulation for some time is a global-no-first-use agreement (GNFU), with unilateral or bilateral NFUs as another option.&quot;

According to SIPRI&#x27;s 1984 analysis, first use of nuclear weapons as a right of self-defense in warfare is the &quot;most controversial&quot; under international law—a right, in their view, not unlimited. Highlighted also were the views of &quot;religious, political and military authorities&quot; who questioned a first-use doctrine. SIPRI concluded that a meaningful no-first-use declaration &quot;would have to be accompanied—or preferably preceded—by changes in the deployment of both nuclear and conventional forces&quot;.

Sparking debate with their 1982 &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; article, former US national security advisor McGeorge Bundy, US diplomat George F. Kennan, former US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and US lead negotiator for the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks Gerard C. Smith challenged the US and the Atlantic Alliance &quot;to consider the possibilities, the requirements, the difficulties, and the advantages of a policy of no-first-use&quot; and urged that citizens, too, consider these policy questions. The authors believed that fully exploring NFU as a strategy and policy would reveal greater advantages than costs and &quot;help the peoples and governments of the Alliance to find the political will to move in this direction&quot;. They called &quot;both fear and mistrust ... the most immediate enemies&quot;, arguing that: &quot;The Soviet government has repeatedly offered to join the West in declaring such a policy, and while such declarations may have only limited reliability, it would be wrong to disregard the real value to both sides of a jointly declared adherence to this policy.&quot; They also maintained that an NFU posture and policy &quot;could help to open the path toward serious reduction of nuclear armaments on both sides&quot;, cautioning that &quot;[a]s long as the weapons themselves exist, the possibility of use will remain.&quot;

In the context of Japan&#x27;s reliance on US extended deterrence, former Japanese diplomat, director of JIIA&#x27;s Center for the Promotion of Disarmament and Nonproliferation (2008–2014) and commissioner of the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission (2014–2017) Nobuyasu Abe in 2018 called for re-examining the role of nuclear weapons alongside the non-nuclear military situation in the regional security environment to bridge the &quot;great divide between idealists and realists&quot; on adopting a no-first-use policy. He described the political divide in Japan as the skepticism of the Japanese government, the ruling LDP, and &quot;center/right conservatives&quot; on the one hand, and the support of the ruling coalition&#x27;s junior partner Komeito, opposition parties, and &quot;left/center anti-nuclear idealists&quot; on the other. In its analysis of South Korea&#x27;s reliance on US extended deterrence, the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in January 2022 wrote that, were the US to adopt an NFU position, the credibility of its extended deterrence would be diminished. The institute&#x27;s public attitudes survey findings, published in May 2023, include naming North Korea as the most pressing security concern, followed by China. In its November 2017 policy brief, the European Council on Foreign Relations concluded that North Korea&#x27;s posture is one of &quot;nuclear pre-emption&quot; and its government &quot;concerned that a first strike could destroy it&quot;; in contrast, China pursues &quot;what Beijing calls &#x27;nuclear counterstrike campaigns, having declared its NFU doctrine out of the belief &quot;that neither its government nor its nuclear arsenal could be eliminated in a first strike by a hostile power&quot;. And in the foreground of strained relations between South Korea and Japan, stemming from Japan&#x27;s 1910–1945 occupation of Korea, the June 2023 trilateral meeting of the countries&#x27; military chiefs signaled closer nuclear strategy consultation at the urging of their US counterpart.

Nonresident Senior Fellows in Brookings&#x27;s Center for East Asia Policy Studies Richard C. Bush and Jonathan D. Pollack in 2016 noted that &quot;non-nuclear states living in the shadow of nuclear-armed adversaries&quot; are willing to forego developing their own nuclear arms because of US security guarantees, and that adopting an NFU doctrine &quot;would represent a profound shift&quot; in those guarantees. Co-founder Keith B. Payne and Research Scholar Michaela Dodge of the National Institute for Public Policy in 2023 noted that for decades &quot;US allies&quot; have continued to oppose such a shift, citing a reported survey by the Biden Administration as the most recent indicator, and called for, among other things, &quot;a more informed public discourse&quot; by strengthening and expanding participation in strategic deterrence dialogues. The authors also noted that further enlargement of &quot;underlying &#x27;anti-nuclear&#x27; sentiment among some allied governments and/or their publics ... would essentially eliminate the existing US extended nuclear deterrence policy, particularly (but not only) undercutting NATO allied participation in NATO&#x27;s nuclear deterrence policy.&quot; Former chair of the Bundestag Subcommittee on Disarmament and Arms Control Uta Zapf in 2021 characterized NFU policy adoption as &quot;a first step and a door-opener for an urgently needed dialog on the role of NW in military doctrines and strategies&quot;. Dominic Tierney, political science professor at Swarthmore College and author of &quot;The Right Way to Lose a War: America in an Age of Unwinnable Conflicts&quot;, in 2016 wrote: &quot;Champions and critics of no-first-use often cast it as a principled policy and a revolutionary step, for good or for ill. But the idealistic symbolism of no-first-use betrays an underlying reality. Disavowing a first strike is a luxury afforded to the strong. ... No-first-use is the policy of Goliath, not Gandhi.&quot;

From the perspective of TPNW supporters, ambassador and director for Disarmament, Arms Control and Non-Proliferation at the Austrian Foreign Ministry Alexander Kmentt in 2020 explained that nuclear risk reduction measures, including de-alerting and de-targeting as well as no-first-use declarations, are &quot;assessed as having a negative impact on the credibility of nuclear deterrence&quot; and &quot;considered only insofar, as they do not impact the nuclear deterrence calculus, which in itself is the origin of nuclear risk&quot;. In her 2018 view of narratives surrounding the TPNW, Heather Williams of King&#x27;s College London acknowledged the importance of deterrence as a security tool to many states and proposed a &quot;bridge-building framework&quot; involving supporters and opponents finding common ground and working together, for example, on nuclear risk reduction.

By 2020 new NFU commitments and ideas had stalled, according to Wilfred Wan, UNIDIR researcher on the global nonproliferation regime, because of the deep divide over whether they reduce risk or, for example, increase risk by undermining strategic stability, while John Borrie, lead for UNIDIR&#x27;s research program on WMDs, noted that even the definition of strategic stability was evolving due to the unpredictability of and increasing strategic concerns. In the same publication, Manpreet Sethi, lead researcher for the Centre for Air Power Studies, recommended that China&#x27;s and India&#x27;s unilateral NFU declarations be turned into a bilateral statement as a step towards nuclear risk reduction in South Asia, &quot;since the risk of not taking any would be quite risky indeed&quot;. The following year, the India-based Observer Research Foundation co-authored an opinion piece with Manpreet Sethi, mentioning the reintroduction of the No First Use Act in both chambers of the US Congress as &quot;hope rekindled&quot; and noting that, given the reality of countries unwilling to give up their nuclear weapons, an NFU &quot;allows nations to maintain a notional sense of security from their nuclear weapons, but significantly reduces possibilities of use&quot;. And in its effort to shape proposals and ideas on nuclear risk reduction &quot;into a pathway to achieve the treaty-mandated disarmament end state of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,&quot; the Council on Strategic Risks places the universal adoption of NFU at &quot;the starting gate for any process towards full nuclear disarmament.&quot;

<doc id="45967" wikidata="Q151973" url="?curid=45967" title="Richard Burton">
<text>Richard Burton (; born Richard Walter Jenkins Jr.; 10 November 1925 – 5 August 1984) was a Welsh actor. 

Noted for his mellifluous baritone voice, Burton established himself as a formidable Shakespearean actor in the 1950s and gave a memorable performance as Hamlet in 1964. He was called &quot;the natural successor to Olivier&quot; by critic Kenneth Tynan. Burton&#x27;s perceived failure to live up to those expectations disappointed some critics and colleagues; his heavy drinking added to his image as a great performer who had wasted his talent. Nevertheless, he is widely regarded as one of the finest actors of his generation.

Burton was nominated for an Academy Award seven times but never won. He was nominated for his performances in &quot;My Cousin Rachel&quot; (1952), &quot;The Robe&quot; (1953), &quot;Becket&quot; (1964), &quot;The Spy Who Came In from the Cold&quot; (1965), &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; (1966), &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot; (1969) and &quot;Equus&quot; (1977). He received numerous accolades, including a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award and a Grammy Award. He received the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for his portrayal of King Arthur in the Lerner and Loewe musical &quot;Camelot&quot; (1960).

In the mid-1960s, Burton became a top box-office star. By the late 1960s, he was one of the highest-paid actors in the world, receiving fees of $1 million or more plus a share of the gross receipts. Burton remained closely associated in the public mind with his second wife, Elizabeth Taylor. The couple&#x27;s turbulent relationship, married twice and divorced twice, was rarely out of the news.

== Early life ==
=== Childhood ===
Burton was born Richard Walter Jenkins Jr. on 10 November 1925 in a house at 2 Dan-y-bont in Pontrhydyfen, Glamorgan, Wales. He was the twelfth of thirteen children born into the Welsh-speaking family of Richard Walter Jenkins Sr. (5 March 1876 – 25 March 1957), and Edith Maude Jenkins (née Thomas; 28 January 1883 – 31 October 1927). Jenkins Sr., called Daddy Ni by the family, was a coal miner, while his mother worked as a barmaid at a pub called the Miner&#x27;s Arms in the village, where she met and married her husband. According to biographer Melvyn Bragg, Richard is quoted saying that Daddy Ni was a &quot;twelve-pints-a-day man&quot; who sometimes went off on drinking and gambling sprees for weeks, and that &quot;he looked very much like me&quot;. Jenkins Sr. was badly burned in a mining explosion and his father Thomas had been confined to a wheelchair after a mining accident.
He remembered his mother to be &quot;a very strong woman&quot; and &quot;a religious soul with fair hair and a beautiful face&quot;. Richard was barely two years old when his mother died on 31 October, six days after the birth of Graham, the family&#x27;s thirteenth child. Edith&#x27;s death was a result of postpartum infections; Richard believed it occurred because of &quot;hygiene neglect&quot;. According to biographer Michael Munn, Edith &quot;was fastidiously clean&quot;, but her exposure to the dust from the coal mines resulted in her death. Following Edith&#x27;s death, Richard&#x27;s elder sister Cecilia, whom he affectionately addressed as &quot;Cis&quot;, and her husband Elfed James, also a miner, took him under their care. Richard lived with Cis, Elfed and their two daughters, Marian and Rhianon, in their three-bedroom terraced cottage on 73 Caradoc Street, Taibach, a suburban district in Port Talbot, which Bragg describes as &quot;a tough steel town, English-speaking, grind and grime&quot;.
Richard remained forever grateful and loving to Cis throughout his life, later going on to say: &quot;When my mother died she, my sister, had become my mother, and more mother to me than any mother could ever have been ... I was immensely proud of her ... she felt all tragedies except her own&quot;. Daddy Ni would occasionally visit the homes of his grown daughters but was otherwise absent. Another important figure in Richard&#x27;s early life was Ifor, his brother, 19 years his senior. A miner and rugby union player, Ifor &quot;ruled the household with the proverbial firm hand&quot;. He was also responsible for nurturing a passion for rugby in young Richard. Although Richard also played cricket, tennis, and table tennis, biographer Bragg notes rugby union football to be his greatest interest. On rugby, Richard said he &quot;would rather have played for Wales at Cardiff Arms Park than Hamlet at The Old Vic&quot;. The Welsh rugby union centre, Bleddyn Williams believed Richard &quot;had distinct possibilities as a player&quot;.

From the age of five to eight, Richard was educated at the Eastern Primary School while he attended the Boys&#x27; segment of the same school from eight to twelve years old. He took a scholarship exam for admission into Port Talbot Secondary School in March 1937 and passed it. Biographer Hollis Alpert notes that both Daddy Ni and Ifor considered Richard&#x27;s education to be &quot;of paramount importance&quot; and planned to send him to the University of Oxford. Richard became the first member of his family to go to secondary school. He displayed an excellent speaking and singing voice since childhood, even winning an eisteddfod prize as a boy soprano. Whilst a pupil at Port Talbot Secondary School, Richard also showed immense interest in reading poetry as well as English and Welsh literature. He earned pocket money by running messages, hauling horse manure, and delivering newspapers.

=== Philip Burton years ===

Richard was bolstered by winning the Eisteddfod Prize and wanted to repeat his success. He chose to sing Sir Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Orpheus with his Lute&quot; (1866), which biographer Alpert thought &quot;a difficult composition&quot;. He requested the help of his schoolmaster, Philip Burton, but his voice cracked during their practice sessions. This incident marked the beginning of his association with Philip. Philip later recalled, &quot;His voice was tough to begin with but with constant practice it became memorably beautiful.&quot; Richard made his first foray into theatre with a minor role in his school&#x27;s production of the Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;The Apple Cart&quot;. He decided to leave school by the end of 1941 and work as a miner as Elfed. He was not fit enough, owing to illness. He worked for the local wartime Co-operative committee, handing out supplies in exchange for war-time ration coupons. He also simultaneously considered other professions for his future, including boxing, religion and singing. It was also during this period that Richard took up smoking and drinking despite being underage.

When he joined the Port Talbot Squadron 499 of the Air Training Corps section of the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a cadet, he re-encountered Philip, who was the squadron commander. He also joined the Taibach Youth Centre, a youth drama group founded by Meredith Jones and led by Leo Lloyd, a steel worker and avid amateur thespian, who taught him the fundamentals of acting. Richard played the role of an escaped convict in Lloyd&#x27;s play, &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Candlesticks&quot;, an adaptation of a section of Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. The play did not have any dialogue, but Alpert noted that Richard &quot;mimed his role&quot;. Philip gave him a part in a radio documentary/adaptation of his play for BBC Radio, &quot;Youth at the Helm&quot; (1942). Seeing the talent Richard possessed, both Jones and Philip re-admitted him to school on 5 October 1942. Philip tutored his charge intensely in school subjects and also worked at developing the youth&#x27;s acting voice, including outdoor voice drills which improved his projection. Richard called the experience &quot;the most hardworking and painful period&quot; in his life. Philip called Richard &quot;my son to all intents and purposes. I was committed to him&quot;, while Burton later wrote of Philip, &quot;I owe him everything&quot;.

In the autumn of 1943, Philip planned to adopt Richard but was not able to do so as he was 20 days too young to be 21 years older than his ward, a legal requirement. As a result, Richard became Philip&#x27;s legal ward and changed his surname to &quot;Richard Burton&quot;, after Philip&#x27;s own surname, by means of deed poll, which Richard&#x27;s father accepted. It was also in 1943 that Richard qualified for admission into a university after excelling in the School Certificate Examination. Philip requested Richard to study at Exeter College, Oxford, as a part of a six-month scholarship programme offered by the RAF for qualified cadets prior to active service.

== Career ==
=== 1943–1947: Early career and service in the RAF ===
In 1943, Burton played Professor Henry Higgins in a school production of another Shaw play directed by Philip, &quot;Pygmalion&quot;. The role won him favourable reviews and caught the attention of the dramatist, Emlyn Williams, who offered Burton a small role of the lead character&#x27;s elder brother, Glan, in his play &quot;The Druid&#x27;s Rest&quot;. The play debuted at the Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool on 22 November 1943, and later premiered in St Martin&#x27;s Theatre, London in January 1944. Burton thought the role was &quot;a nothing part&quot; and that he &quot;hardly spoke at all&quot;. He was paid ten pounds a week for playing the role (), which was &quot;three times what the miners got&quot;. Alpert states that the play garnered mixed critical reviews, but James Redfern of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; took notice of Burton&#x27;s performance and wrote: &quot;In a wretched part, Richard Burton showed exceptional ability.&quot; Burton noted that single sentence from Redfern changed his life.

Whilst an undergraduate at Exeter College, University of Oxford, Burton featured as &quot;the complicated sex-driven puritan&quot; Angelo in the Oxford University Dramatic Society&#x27;s 1944 production of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;. The play was directed by Burton&#x27;s English literature professor, Nevill Coghill, and was performed at the college in the presence of additional contributors to West End theatre including John Gielgud, Terence Rattigan and Binkie Beaumont. On Burton&#x27;s performance, fellow actor and friend, Robert Hardy recalled, &quot;There were moments when he totally commanded the audience by this stillness. And the voice which would sing like a violin and with a bass that could shake the floor.&quot; Gielgud appreciated Burton&#x27;s performance and Beaumont, who knew about Burton&#x27;s work in &quot;The Druid&#x27;s Rest&quot;, suggested that he &quot;look him up&quot; after completing his service in the RAF if he still wanted to pursue acting as a profession.

In late 1944, Burton successfully completed his six-month scholarship at Exeter College, Oxford, and went to the RAF classification examinations held in Torquay to train as a pilot. He was disqualified for pilot training because his eyesight was below par, and was classified as a navigator trainee. He served the RAF as navigator for three years, during which he performed an assignment as Aircraftman 1st Class in a Wiltshire-based RAF Hospital and was posted to the RAF base in Carberry, Manitoba, Canada, to work as an instructor. Burton&#x27;s habits of drinking and smoking increased during this period; he was involved in a brief casual affair with actress Eleanor Summerfield. Burton was cast in an uncredited and unnamed role of a bombing officer by BBC Third Programme in a 1946 radio adaptation of &quot;In Parenthesis&quot;, an epic poem of the First World War by David Jones. Burton was discharged from the RAF on 16 December 1947.

=== 1948–1951: Rise through the ranks and film debut ===

In 1948, Burton moved to London to make contact with H. M. Tennent Ltd., where he again met Beaumont, who put him under a contract of £500 per year (£10 a week). Daphne Rye, the casting director for H. M. Tennent Ltd., offered Burton rooms on the top floor of her house in Pelham Crescent, London as a place for him to stay. Rye cast Burton in a minor role as a young officer, Mr. Hicks, in &quot;Castle Anna&quot; (1948), a drama set in Ireland.

While touring with the cast and crew members of Wynyard Browne&#x27;s &quot;Dark Summer&quot;, Burton was called by Emlyn Williams for a screen test for his film, &quot;The Last Days of Dolwyn&quot; (1949). Burton performed the screen test for the role of Gareth, which Williams wrote especially for him, and was subsequently selected when Williams sent him a telegram that quoted a line from &quot;The Corn Is Green&quot; — &quot;You have won the scholarship.&quot; This led to Burton making his mainstream film debut. Filming took place during the summer and early autumn months of 1948. It was on the sets of this film that Burton was introduced by Williams to Sybil Williams, whom he married on 5 February 1949 at a register office in Kensington. &quot;The Last Days of Dolwyn&quot; opened to generally positive critical reviews. Burton was praised for his &quot;acting fire, manly bearing and good looks&quot; and film critic Philip French of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it an &quot;impressive movie debut&quot;. After marrying Sybil, Burton moved into a flat at 6 Lyndhurst Road, Hampstead NW3, where he lived from 1949 to 1956.

Pleased with the feedback Burton received for his performance in &quot;The Last Days of Dolwyn&quot;, the film&#x27;s co-producer Alexander Korda offered him a contract at a stipend of £100 a week (), which he signed. The contract enabled Korda to lend Burton to films produced by other companies. Throughout the late 1940s and early 50s, Burton acted in small parts in various British films such as &quot;Now Barabbas&quot; (1949) with Richard Greene and Kathleen Harrison, &quot;The Woman with No Name&quot; (1950) opposite Phyllis Calvert, and &quot;Waterfront&quot; (1950) with Harrison. Burton had a bigger part as Robert Hammond, a spy for a newspaper editor in &quot;Green Grow the Rushes&quot; (1951) alongside Honor Blackman. His performance in &quot;Now Barabbas&quot; received positive feedback from critics. C. A. Lejeune of &quot;The Observer&quot; believed Burton had &quot;all the qualities of a leading man that the British film industry badly needs at this juncture: youth, good looks, a photogenic face, obviously alert intelligence and a trick of getting the maximum effort with the minimum of fuss.&quot; For &quot;The Woman With No Name&quot;, a critic from &quot;The New York Times&quot; thought Burton &quot;merely adequate&quot; in his role of the Norwegian aviator, Nick Chamerd. Biographer Bragg states the reviews for Burton&#x27;s performance in &quot;Waterfront&quot; were &quot;not bad&quot;, and that &quot;Green Grow the Rushes&quot; was a box office bomb.

Rye recommended Richard to director Peter Glenville for the part of Hephaestion in Rattigan&#x27;s play about Alexander the Great, &quot;Adventure Story&quot;, in 1949. The play was directed by Glenville and starred the then up-and-coming actor Paul Scofield as the titular character. Glenville, however, rejected him as he felt that Burton was too short compared to Scofield. Rye came to the rescue again by sending Burton to audition for a role in &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Not for Burning&quot;, a play by Christopher Fry and directed by Gielgud. The lead roles were played by Gielgud himself, and Pamela Brown, while Burton played a supporting role as Richard alongside the then-relatively unknown actress Claire Bloom. Gielgud was initially uncertain about selecting Burton and asked him to come back the following day to repeat his audition. Burton got the part the second time he auditioned for the role. He was paid £15 a week for the part, which was five more than what Beaumont was paying him. After getting the part, he pushed for a raise in his salary from £10 to £30 a week with Williams&#x27; assistance, in addition to the £100 Korda paid him; Beaumont accepted it after much persuasion. Bloom was impressed with Burton&#x27;s natural way of acting, noting that &quot;he just was&quot; and went further by saying &quot;He was recognisably a star, a fact he didn&#x27;t question.&quot;

The play opened at the Globe Theatre in May 1949 and had a successful run in London for a year. Writer and journalist Samantha Ellis of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, in her overview of the play, thought critics found Burton to be &quot;most authentic&quot; for his role. Gielgud took the play to Broadway in the United States, where it opened at the Royale Theatre on 8 November 1950. Theatre critic Brooks Atkinson appreciated the performances and praised the play&#x27;s &quot;hard glitter of wit and skepticism&quot;, while describing Fry as precocious with &quot;a touch of genius&quot;. The play ran on Broadway until 17 March 1951, and received the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle award for the Best Foreign Play of 1951. Burton received the Theatre World Award for his performance, his first major award.

Burton went on to feature in two more plays by Fry – &quot;The Boy With A Cart&quot; and &quot;A Phoenix Too Frequent&quot;. The former opened at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith in February 1950, while the latter premiered at the Dolphin Theatre, Brighton the following month. Gielgud, who also directed &quot;The Boy With A Cart&quot;, said that Burton&#x27;s role in the play &quot;was one of the most beautiful performances&quot; he had ever seen. During its month-long run, Anthony Quayle, who was on the lookout for a young actor to star as Prince Hal in his adaptations of &quot;Henry IV, Part I&quot; and &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; as a part of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre season for the Festival of Britain, came to see the play and as soon as he beheld Burton, he found his man and got his agreement to play the parts. Both plays opened in 1951 at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon to mixed reviews, but Burton received acclaim for his role as Prince Hal, with many critics dubbing him &quot;the next Laurence Olivier&quot;. Theatre critic Kenneth Tynan said of his performance, &quot;His playing of Prince Hal turned interested speculation to awe almost as soon as he started to speak; in the first intermission local critics stood agape in the lobbies.&quot; He was also praised by Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall after both saw the play. Bacall later said of him: &quot;He was just marvellous [...] Bogie loved him. We all did.&quot; Burton celebrated his success by buying his first car, a Standard Flying Fourteen, and enjoyed a drink with Bogart at a pub called The Dirty Duck. Philip too was happy with the progress his ward made, and felt &quot;proud, humble, and awed by god&#x27;s mysterious ways&quot;.

Burton went on to perform in &quot;Henry V&quot; as the titular character, and played Ferdinand in &quot;The Tempest&quot; as a part of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre season as well. Neither role was overwhelmingly received by the critics, with a reviewer saying &quot;he lacked inches&quot; as Henry V. Olivier defended Burton by retaliating that he too received the same kind of review by the same critic for the same role. His last play in 1951 was as a musician named Orphée in Jean Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;Eurydice&quot; opposite Dorothy McGuire and fellow Welsh actor Hugh Griffith. The play, retitled as &quot;Legend of Lovers&quot;, opened in the Plymouth Theatre, New York City and ran for only a week, but critics were kind to Burton, with Bob Francis of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine finding him &quot;excellent as the self-tortured young accordionist&quot;.

=== 1952–1954: Hollywood and The Old Vic ===
Burton began 1952 by starring alongside Noel Willman in the title role of Emmanuel Roblès adventure &quot;Montserrat&quot;, which opened on 8 April at the Lyric Hammersmith. The play only ran for six weeks but Burton once again won praise from critics. According to Bragg, some of the critics who watched the performance considered it to be Burton&#x27;s &quot;most convincing role&quot; till then. Tynan lauded Burton&#x27;s role of Captain Montserrat, noting that he played it &quot;with a variousness which is amazing when you consider that it is really little more than a protracted exposition of smouldering dismay&quot;.

Burton successfully made the transition to Hollywood on the recommendation of film director George Cukor when he was given the lead role in the Gothic romance film, &quot;My Cousin Rachel&quot; (1952) opposite Olivia de Havilland. Darryl F. Zanuck, co-founder of 20th Century Fox, negotiated a deal with Korda to loan Burton to the company for three films as well as pay Burton a total of $150,000 ($50,000 per film). De Havilland did not get along well with Burton during filming, calling him &quot;a coarse-grained man with a coarse-grained charm and a talent not completely developed, and a coarse-grained which makes him not like anyone else&quot;. One of Burton&#x27;s friends opined it may have been because of Burton&#x27;s making remarks to her that she did not find in good taste.

While shooting &quot;My Cousin Rachel&quot;, Burton was offered the role of Mark Antony in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1953) by the production company, Metro Goldwyn Mayer (MGM), but Burton refused it to avoid schedule conflicts. The role subsequently went to Marlon Brando for which he earned a BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor and an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Based on the 1951 novel of the same name by Daphne du Maurier, &quot;My Cousin Rachel&quot; is about a man who suspects his rich cousin was murdered by his wife in order to inherit his wealth, but ends up falling in love with her, despite his suspicions. Upon release, the film was a decent grosser at the box office, and Burton&#x27;s performance received mostly excellent reviews. Bosley Crowther, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, appreciated Burton&#x27;s emotional performance, describing it as &quot;most fetching&quot;; he called him &quot;the perfect hero of Miss du Maurier&#x27;s tale&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; reviewer stated &quot;young Burton registers with an intense performance that stamps him as an actor of great potential&quot;. Conversely, a critic from the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; labelled Burton as &quot;terribly, terribly tweedy&quot;. The film earned Burton the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor and his first Academy Award nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category.
The year 1953 marked an important turning point in Burton&#x27;s career. He arrived in Hollywood at a time when the studio system was struggling. The rise of television was drawing viewers away and the studios looked to new stars and film technologies to tempt viewers back to cinemas. He first appeared in the war film &quot;The Desert Rats&quot; with James Mason, playing an English captain in the North African campaign during World War II who takes charge of a hopelessly out-numbered Australian unit against the indomitable German field marshal, Erwin Rommel, who was portrayed by Mason. The film received generally good reviews from critics in London, although they complained the British contribution to the campaign had been minimised. The critic from &quot;Variety&quot; magazine thought Burton was &quot;excellent&quot; while &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer noted his &quot;electric portrayal of the hero&quot; made the film look &quot;more than a plain, cavalier apology&quot;. Burton and Sybil became good friends with Mason and his wife Pamela Mason, and stayed at their residence until Burton returned home to the UK in June 1953 in order to play Prince Hamlet as a part of The Old Vic 1953–54 season. This was to be the first time in his career he took up the role.

Burton&#x27;s second and final film of the year was in the Biblical epic historical drama, &quot;The Robe&quot;, notable for being the first-ever motion picture to be made in CinemaScope. He replaced Tyrone Power, who was originally cast in the role of Marcellus Gallio, a noble but decadent Roman military tribune in command of the detachment of Roman soldiers that were involved in crucifying Jesus Christ. Haunted by nightmares of the crucifixion, he is eventually led to his own conversion. Marcellus&#x27; Greek slave Demetrius (played by Victor Mature) guides him as a spiritual teacher, and his wife Diana (played by Jean Simmons) follows his lead. The film set a trend for Biblical epics such as &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959). Based on Lloyd C. Douglas&#x27; 1942 historical novel of the same name, &quot;The Robe&quot; was well received at the time of its release, but contemporary reviews have been less favourable. &quot;Variety&quot; magazine termed the performances of the lead cast &quot;effective&quot; and complemented the fight sequences between Burton and Jeff Morrow. Crowther believed that Burton was &quot;stalwart, spirited and stern&quot; as Marcellus. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; called &quot;The Robe&quot; &quot;pious claptrap&quot;. The film was a commercial success, grossing $17 million against a $5 million budget, and Burton received his second Best Actor nomination at the 26th Academy Awards.

Bolstered by &quot;The Robe&quot;″s box office collections, Zanuck offered Burton a seven-year, seven-picture $1 million contract (), but he politely turned it down as he was planning to head home to portray &quot;Hamlet&quot; at The Old Vic. Zanuck threatened to force Burton into cutting the deal, but the duo managed to come to a compromise when Burton agreed to a less binding contract, also for seven years and seven films at $1 million, that would begin only after he returned from his stint at The Old Vic&#x27;s 1953–54 season.

The incident spread like wildfire and his decision to walk out on a million-dollar contract for a stipend of £150 a week at The Old Vic was met with both appreciation and surprise. Bragg believed Burton defied the studio system with this act when it would have been tantamount to unemployment for him. Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper considered Burton&#x27;s success in his first three films in Hollywood to be &quot;the most exciting success story since Gregory Peck&#x27;s contracts of ten years back&quot;.

At a party held at Simmons&#x27; residence in Bel Air, Los Angeles to celebrate the success of &quot;The Robe&quot;, Burton met Elizabeth Taylor for the first time. Taylor, who at the time was married to actor Michael Wilding and was pregnant with their first child, recalled her first impression of Burton being &quot;rather full of himself. I seem to remember that he never stopped talking, and I had given him the cold fish eye.&quot; Hamlet was a challenge that both terrified and attracted him, as it was a role many of his peers in the British theatre had undertaken, including Gielgud and Olivier. He shared his anxiety with de Havilland whilst coming to terms with her. Bogart too, didn&#x27;t make it easy for him when he retorted: &quot;I never knew a man who played &quot;Hamlet&quot; who didn&#x27;t die broke.&quot;

Notwithstanding, Burton began his thirty-nine-week stint at The Old Vic by rehearsing for &quot;Hamlet&quot; in July 1953, with Philip providing expert coaching on how to make Hamlet&#x27;s character match Burton&#x27;s dynamic acting style. Burton reunited with Bloom, who played Ophelia. &quot;Hamlet&quot; opened at the Assembly Hall in Edinburgh, Scotland in September 1953 as part of The Old Vic season during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The play and Burton&#x27;s Hamlet were, on the whole, well received, with critics describing his interpretation of the character as &quot;moody, virile and baleful&quot; and that he had &quot;dash, attack and verve&quot;. Burton&#x27;s Hamlet was quite popular with the young audience, who came to watch the play in numbers as they were quite taken with the aggressiveness with which he portrayed the role. Burton also received appreciation from Winston Churchill. Gielgud was not too happy with Burton&#x27;s Hamlet and asked him while both were backstage: &quot;Shall I go ahead and wait until you&#x27;re better?... ah, I mean ready?&quot; Burton picked up the hint and infused some of Gielgud&#x27;s traits to his own in later performances as Hamlet. A greater success followed in the form of the Roman General Gaius Marcius Coriolanus in &quot;Coriolanus&quot;. At first, Burton refused to play Coriolanus as he didn&#x27;t like the character&#x27;s initial disdain for the poor and the downtrodden. Michael Benthall, who was renowned for his association with Tyrone Guthrie in a 1944 production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, sought Philip&#x27;s help to entice Burton into accepting it. Philip convinced Burton by making him realise that it was Coriolanus&#x27; &quot;lack of ambivalence&quot; which made him an admirable character. Burton received even better reviews for Coriolanus than Hamlet. Hardy thought Burton&#x27;s Hamlet was &quot;too strong&quot; but that &quot;His Coriolanus is quite easily the best I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; Olivier too agreed it was the greatest Coriolanus he had ever seen till then.

Burton&#x27;s other roles for the season were Sir Toby Belch in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, Caliban in &quot;The Tempest&quot; and Philip of Cognac in &quot;King John&quot;. All five of Burton&#x27;s plays were directed by Benthall; three of those plays featured Bloom. While Belch was considered &quot;disappointing&quot;, owing to Burton&#x27;s not putting on the proper make-up for the part, his reviews for Caliban and Philip of Cognac were positive. Alpert believed Burton&#x27;s presence made the 1953–54 season of The Old Vic a commercial success. Burton was an ardent admirer of poet Dylan Thomas since his boyhood days. On the poet&#x27;s death on 9 November 1953, he wrote an essay about him and took the time to do a 1954 BBC Radio play on one of his final works, &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;, where he voiced the First Voice in an all-Welsh cast. The entire cast of the radio play, including Burton, did their roles free of charge. Burton reprised his role in the play&#x27;s 1972 film adaptation with Taylor. Burton was also involved in narrating Lindsay Anderson&#x27;s short documentary film about The Royal School for the Deaf in Margate, &quot;Thursday&#x27;s Children&quot; (1954).

=== 1955–1959: Setback in films and on-stage fame ===

After The Old Vic season ended, Burton&#x27;s contract with Fox required him to do three more films. The first was &quot;Prince of Players&quot; (1955), where he was cast as the 19th-century Shakespearean actor Edwin Booth, who was John Wilkes Booth&#x27;s brother. Maggie McNamara played Edwin&#x27;s wife, Mary Devlin Booth. Philip thought the script was &quot;a disgrace&quot; to Burton&#x27;s name. The film&#x27;s director Philip Dunne observed, &quot;He hadn&#x27;t mastered yet the tricks of the great movie stars, such as Gary Cooper, who knew them all. The personal magnetism Richard had on the sound stage didn&#x27;t come through the camera.&quot; This was one aspect that troubled Richard throughout his career on celluloid. The film flopped at the box office and has since been described as &quot;the first flop in CinemaScope&quot;. Crowther, however, lauded Burton&#x27;s scenes where he performed Shakespeare plays such as &quot;Richard III&quot;.

Shortly after the release of &quot;Prince of Players&quot;, Burton met director Robert Rossen, who was well known at the time for his Academy Award-winning film, &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; (1949). Rossen planned to cast Burton in &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; (1956) as the eponymous character. Burton accepted Rossen&#x27;s offer after the director reassured him he had been studying the Macedonian king for two years to make sure the film was historically accurate. Burton was loaned by Fox to the film&#x27;s production company United Artists, which paid him a fee of $100,000 (). &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; was made mostly in Spain during February 1955 and July 1955 on a budget of $6 million. The film reunited Burton with Bloom and it was also the first film he made with her. Bloom played the role of Barsine, the daughter of Artabazos II of Phrygia, and one of Alexander&#x27;s three wives. Fredric March, Danielle Darrieux, Stanley Baker, Michael Hordern and William Squire were respectively cast as Philip II of Macedon, Olympias, Attalus, Demosthenes and Aeschines.

After the completion of &quot;Alexander the Great&quot;, Burton had high hopes for a favourable reception of the &quot;intelligent epic&quot;, and went back to complete his next assignment for Fox, Jean Negulesco&#x27;s &quot;The Rains of Ranchipur&quot; (1955). In this remake of Fox&#x27;s own 1939 film &quot;The Rains Came&quot;, Burton played a Hindu doctor, Rama Safti, who falls in love with Lady Edwina Esketh (Lana Turner), an invitee of the Maharani of the fictional town of Ranchipur. Burton faced the same troubles with playing character roles as before with Belch. &quot;The Rains of Ranchipur&quot; released on 16 December 1955, three months before &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; rolled out on 28 March 1956. Contrary to Burton&#x27;s expectations, both the films were critical and commercial failures, and he rued his decision to act in them. &quot;Time&quot; magazine critic derided &quot;The Rains of Ranchipur&quot; and even went as far as to say Richard was hardly noticeable in the film. A. H. Weiler of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, however, called Burton&#x27;s rendering of Alexander &quot;serious and impassioned&quot;.

Burton returned to The Old Vic to perform &quot;Henry V&quot; for a second time. The Benthall-directed production opened in December 1955 to glowing reviews and was a much-needed triumph for Burton. Tynan made it official by famously saying Burton was now &quot;the next successor to Olivier&quot;. The reviewer from &quot;The Times&quot; began by pointing out the deficiencies in Burton&#x27;s previous rendition of the character in 1951 before stating &quot;Mr. Burton&#x27;s progress as an actor is such that already he is able to make good all the lacks of a few short years ago ... what was greatly metallic has been transformed into a steely strength which becomes the martial ring and hard brilliance of the patriotic verse. There now appears a romantic sense of a high kingly mission and the clear cognisance of the capacity to fulfil it ... the whole performance — a mostly satisfying one — is firmly under the control of the imagination&quot;.

In January 1956, the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; honoured Burton by presenting to him its Theatre Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Henry V. His success in and as Henry V led him to be called the &quot;Welsh Wizard&quot;. &quot;Henry V&quot; was followed by Benthall&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Othello&quot; in February 1956, where he alternated on successive openings between the roles of Othello and Iago with John Neville. As Othello, Burton received both praise for his dynamism and criticism with being less poetical with his dialogues, while he was acclaimed as Iago.

Burton&#x27;s stay at The Old Vic was cut short when he was approached by the Italian neorealist director Roberto Rossellini for Fox&#x27;s &quot;Sea Wife&quot; (1957), a drama set in World War II about a nun and three men marooned on an island after the ship they travel on is torpedoed by a U-boat. Joan Collins, who played the nun, was his co-star. Burton&#x27;s role was that of an RAF officer who develops romantic feelings for the nun. Rossellini was informed by Zanuck not to have any kissing scenes between Burton and Collins, which Rossellini found unnatural; this led to him walking out of the film and being replaced by Bob McNaught, one of the executive producers. According to Collins, Burton had a &quot;take-the-money-and-run attitude&quot; toward the film. &quot;Sea Wife&quot; was not a successful venture, with biographer Munn observing that his salary was the only positive feature that came from the film. Philip saw it and said he was &quot;ashamed&quot; that it added another insult to injury in Burton&#x27;s career.

After &quot;Sea Wife&quot;, Burton next appeared as the British Army Captain Jim Leith in Nicholas Ray&#x27;s &quot;Bitter Victory&quot; (1957). Burton admired Ray&#x27;s &quot;Rebel Without A Cause&quot; (1955) and was excited about working with him, but unfortunately despite positive feedback, &quot;Bitter Victory&quot; tanked as well. By mid-1957, Burton had no further offers in his kitty. He could not return to the UK because of his self-imposed exile from taxation, and his fortunes in film were dwindling. It was then that film producer and screenwriter Milton Sperling offered Burton to star alongside Helen Hayes and Susan Strasberg in Patricia Moyes&#x27; adaptation of Jean Anouilh&#x27;s play, &quot;Time Remembered&quot; (&quot;Léocadia&quot; in the original French version). Sensing an opportunity for a career resurgence, Burton readily agreed to do the role of Prince Albert, who falls in love with a milliner named Amanda (Strasberg). It was on 10 September 1957, a day before he left for New York, that Sybil gave birth to their first child, Kate Burton. &quot;Time Remembered&quot; was well received on its opening nights at Broadway&#x27;s Morosco Theatre and also at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C. The play went on to have a good run of 248 performances for six months. Burton received his first Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play nomination while Hayes won her second Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her role as Burton&#x27;s mother, The Duchess of Pont-Au-Bronc.

In 1958, Burton appeared with Yvonne Furneaux in DuPont Show of the Month&#x27;s 90-minute television adaptation of Emily Brontë&#x27;s classic novel &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; as Heathcliff. The film, directed by Daniel Petrie, aired on 9 May 1958 on CBS with Burton garnering plaudits from both the critics and Philip, who thought he was &quot;magnificent&quot; in it.

Burton next featured as Jimmy Porter, &quot;an angry young man&quot; role, in the film version of John Osborne&#x27;s play &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (1959), a gritty drama about middle-class life in the British Midlands, directed by Tony Richardson, again with Claire Bloom as co-star. Biographer Bragg observed that &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; &quot;had defined a generation, provided a watershed in Britain&#x27;s view of itself and brought [Osborne] into the public prints as a controversial, dangerous figure&quot;. Burton was able to identify himself with Porter, finding it &quot;fascinating to find a man who came presumably from my sort of class, who actually could talk the way I would like to talk&quot;. The film, and Burton&#x27;s performance, received mixed reviews upon release. Biographer Alpert noted that though reviews in the UK were favourable, those in the United States were more negative. Crowther wrote of Burton: &quot;His tirades are eloquent but tiring, his breast beatings are dramatic but dull and his occasional lapses into sadness are pathetic but endurable.&quot; Geoff Andrew of &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine felt Burton was too old for the part, and the &quot;Variety&quot; reviewer thought &quot;the role gives him little opportunity for variety&quot;. 

Contemporary reviews of the film have been better and it has a rating of 89% on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; is now considered one of the defining films of the British New Wave cinema, a movement from the late 1950s to the late 1960s in which working-class characters became the focus of the film and conflict of social classes a central theme. Jimmy Porter is also considered one of Burton&#x27;s best on-screen roles; he was nominated in the Best Actor categories at the BAFTA and Golden Globe Awards but lost to Peter Sellers for &quot;I&#x27;m All Right Jack&quot; (1959) and Anthony Franciosa for &quot;Career&quot; (1959) respectively. Though it didn&#x27;t do well commercially, Burton was proud of the effort and wrote to Philip, &quot;I promise you that there isn&#x27;t a shred of self-pity in my performance. I am for the first time ever looking forward to seeing a film in which I play.&quot; While filming &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;, Burton did another play for BBC Radio, participating in two versions, one in Welsh and another in English, of Welsh poet Saunders Lewis&#x27; &quot;Brad&quot;, which was about the 20 July plot. Burton voiced one of the conspirators, Caesar von Hofacker.

=== 1960–1969: Broadway, &quot;Hamlet&quot; and films with Elizabeth Taylor ===

In 1960, Burton appeared in two films for Warner Bros., neither of which were successful: &quot;The Bramble Bush&quot; which reunited him with his &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; director Petrie, and Vincent Sherman&#x27;s adaptation of Edna Ferber&#x27;s &quot;Ice Palace&quot;. Burton called the latter a &quot;piece of shit&quot;. He received a fee of $125,000 for both films. Burton&#x27;s next appearance was as the stammering secularist, George Holyoake in BBC&#x27;s documentary-style television adaptation of John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;A Subject of Scandal and Concern&quot;. According to Osborne&#x27;s biographer Luc Gilleman, the film garnered little attention. Burton returned to the United States for the filming of John Frankenheimer&#x27;s television adaptation of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;The Fifth Column&quot;. He also provided narration for 26 episodes of &quot;The Valiant Years&quot;, an American Broadcasting Company (ABC) series based on Winston Churchill&#x27;s memoirs.

Burton made a triumphant return to the stage with Moss Hart&#x27;s 1960 Broadway production of &quot;Camelot&quot; as King Arthur. The play, written by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, had Julie Andrews fresh from her triumph in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; playing Guinevere, and Robert Goulet as Lancelot completing the love triangle. Roddy McDowall played the villainous Mordred. Hart first came up with the proposal to Burton after learning from Lerner about his ability to sing. Burton consulted Olivier on whether he should take the role, which came with a stipend of $4,000 a week. Olivier pointed out this salary was good and that he should accept the offer. The production was troubled, with both Loewe and Hart falling ill and the pressure was building, owing to great expectations and huge advance sales. The show&#x27;s running time was nearly five hours. Burton&#x27;s intense preparation and competitive desire to succeed served him well. He immediately drafted Philip, who revised the musical&#x27;s script and cut its running time to three hours while also incorporating three new songs. Burton was generous and supportive to everyone throughout the production and coached the understudies himself. According to Lerner, &quot;he kept the boat from rocking, and &quot;Camelot&quot; might never have reached New York if it hadn&#x27;t been for him&quot;. Burton&#x27;s reviews were excellent, with the critic from &quot;Time&quot; magazine observing that Richard &quot;gives Arthur the skillful and vastly appealing performance that might be expected from one of England&#x27;s finest young actors&quot;. Broadway theatre reviewer Walter Kerr noted Richard&#x27;s syllables, &quot;sing, the account of his wrestling the stone from the sword becomes a bravura passage of house-hushing brilliance&quot; and complemented his duets with Andrews, finding Burton&#x27;s rendition to possess &quot;a sly and fretful and mocking accent to take care of the without destroying the man&quot;.

However, on the whole, the play initially received mixed reviews on its opening at the Majestic Theatre on Broadway and was slow to earn money. Advance sales managed to keep &quot;Camelot&quot; running for three months until a twenty-minute extract was broadcast on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; which helped &quot;Camelot&quot; achieve great success, and an unprecedented three-year run overall from 1960 to 1963. Its success led to Burton being called &quot;The King of Broadway&quot;, and he went on to receive the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. The original soundtrack of the musical topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts throughout 1961 after its release at the end of 1960. John F. Kennedy, who was then the President of the United States, reportedly enjoyed the play and invited Burton to the White House for a visit. In 1962, Burton appeared as Flying Officer David Campbell, an RAF fighter pilot in &quot;The Longest Day&quot;, which included a large ensemble cast featuring: McDowall, George Segal, Henry Fonda, John Wayne, Mel Ferrer, Robert Mitchum, Rod Steiger and Sean Connery. The same year he provided narration for the Jack Howells documentary &quot;Dylan Thomas&quot;. The short won the Best Documentary Short Subject at the 35th Academy Awards ceremony.

After performing &quot;Camelot&quot; for six months, in July 1961, Burton met producer Walter Wanger who asked him to replace Stephen Boyd as Mark Antony in director Joseph L. Mankiewicz&#x27;s magnum opus &quot;Cleopatra&quot;. Burton was paid $250,000 for four months work in the film (). The gigantic scale of the film&#x27;s troubled production, Taylor&#x27;s bouts of illness and fluctuating weight, Burton&#x27;s off-screen relationship with the actress, (which he gave the sardonic nickname &quot;Le Scandale&quot;) all generated enormous publicity; &quot;Life&quot; magazine proclaimed it the &quot;Most Talked About Movie Ever Made&quot;. Fox&#x27;s future appeared to hinge on what became the most expensive movie ever made until then, with costs reaching almost $40 million. During filming, Burton met and fell in love with Elizabeth Taylor, who was then married to Eddie Fisher. According to Alpert, at their first meeting on the set while posing for their publicity photographs, Burton said, &quot;Has anyone ever told you that you&#x27;re a very pretty girl?&quot; Taylor later recalled, &quot;I said to myself, &quot;Oy gevalt&quot;, here&#x27;s the great lover, the great wit, the great intellectual of Wales, and he comes out with a line like that.&quot; Bragg contradicts Alpert by pointing out that Burton could not stand Taylor at first, calling her &quot;Miss Tits&quot; and opined to Mankiewicz, &quot;I expect she shaves&quot;; he saw her simply as another celebrity with no acting talent. All that changed when, in their first scene together, Burton was shaky and forgot his lines, and she soothed and helped him; it was at this instance, according to Taylor, that she fell for him. Soon the affair began in earnest; both Fisher and Sybil were unable to bear it. While Fisher fled the sets for Gstaad, Sybil went first to Céligny and then headed off to London. Olivier, shocked by Burton&#x27;s affair with Taylor, cabled him: &quot;Make up your mind, dear heart. Do you want to be a great actor or a household word?&quot;. Burton replied &quot;Both&quot;.

&quot;Cleopatra&quot; was finally released on 11 June 1963 with a run time of 243 minutes, to polarising reviews. The &quot;Time&quot; magazine critic found the film &quot;riddled with flaws, [lacking] style both in image and in action&quot;, and wrote Burton &quot;staggers around looking ghastly and spouting irrelevance&quot;. In a contradictory review, Crowther termed the film &quot;generally brilliant, moving, and satisfying&quot; and thought Burton was &quot;exciting as the arrogant Antony&quot;. Richard Brody of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; commented positively on the chemistry between Burton and Taylor, describing it as &quot;entrancing in the movie&#x27;s drama as it was in life&quot;. &quot;Cleopatra&quot; grossed over $26 million (), becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 1963. It was not enough to prevent Fox from entering bankruptcy. The studio sued Burton and Taylor for allegedly damaging the film&#x27;s prospects at the box office with their behaviour, but it proved unsuccessful. &quot;Cleopatra&quot; was nominated for nine Academy Awards, winning for Best Production Design, Best Costume Design and Best Visual Effects.

The film marked the beginning of a series of collaborations with Taylor, in addition to making Burton one of the Top 10 box office draws until 1967. Burton played her tycoon husband Paul Andros in Anthony Asquith&#x27;s &quot;The V.I.P.s&quot; (1963), an ensemble cast film described by Alpert as a &quot;kind of &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; story&quot; that was set in the VIP lounge of London Heathrow Airport; it proved to be a box-office hit despite mixed reviews. It was after &quot;The V.I.P.s&quot; that Burton became considerably more selective about his roles; he credited Taylor for this as he simply acted in films &quot;to get rich&quot; and she &quot;made me see what kind of rubbish I was doing&quot;. Burton divorced Sybil in April 1963 after completing &quot;The V.I.P.s&quot; while Taylor was granted divorce from Fisher on 6 March 1964. Taylor then took a two-year hiatus from films until her next venture with Burton, &quot;The Sandpiper&quot; (1965). The supercouple, dubbed &quot;Liz and Dick&quot; by the press, continued starring together in films in the mid-1960s, earning a combined $88 million over the next decade and spending $65 million. Regarding their earnings, in a 1976 interview with Lester David and Jhan Robbins of &quot;The Ledger&quot;, Burton stated that &quot;they say we generate more business activity than one of the smaller African nations&quot; and that the couple &quot;often outspent&quot; the Greek business tycoon Aristotle Onassis.

In 1964, Burton portrayed Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England, in the film adaptation of Jean Anouilh&#x27;s historical play &quot;Becket&quot;. Both Alpert and historian Alex von Tunzelmann noted Burton gave an effective, restrained performance, contrasting with co-actor and friend Peter O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s manic portrayal of Henry. Burton asked the film&#x27;s director, Peter Glenville, not to oust him from the project like he had done for &quot;Adventure Story&quot; before accepting the role of Becket. Writing for &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, Peter Rainer labelled Burton as &quot;extraordinary&quot;. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; appreciated Burton&#x27;s on-screen chemistry with O&#x27;Toole and thought his portrayal of Becket served as &quot;a reminder of how fine an actor Burton was&quot;. The film received twelve Oscar nominations, including Best Actor for both Burton and O&#x27;Toole; they lost to Harrison for &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1964). Burton and O&#x27;Toole also received nominations for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama at the 22nd Golden Globe Awards, with O&#x27;Toole emerging victorious. Burton&#x27;s triumph at the box office continued with his next appearance as the defrocked clergyman Dr. T. Lawrence Shannon in Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1964) directed by John Huston; the film was also critically well received. Alpert believed Burton&#x27;s success was due to how well he varied his acting with the three female characters, each of whom he tries to seduce differently: Ava Gardner (the randy hotel owner), Sue Lyon (the nubile American tourist), and Deborah Kerr (the poor, repressed artist). The success of &quot;Becket&quot; and &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; led &quot;Time&quot; magazine to term him &quot;the new Mr. Box Office&quot;.
During the production of &quot;Becket&quot;, Burton went to watch Gielgud perform in the 1963 stage adaptation of Thornton Wilder&#x27;s 1948 novel, &quot;The Ides of March&quot;. There he was confronted by Gielgud who asked what Burton planned to do as a part of the celebration of Shakespeare&#x27;s quatercentenary. Burton told him he was approached by theatrical producer Alexander H. Cohen to do &quot;Hamlet&quot; in New York City. Burton had accepted Cohen&#x27;s offer under the condition that Gielgud would direct it, which he conveyed to Gielgud. Gielgud agreed and soon production began in January 1964 after Burton had completed his work in &quot;Becket&quot; and &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot;. Taking into account Burton&#x27;s dislike for wearing period clothing, as well as fellow actor Harley Granville-Barker&#x27;s notion that the play was best approached as a &quot;permanent rehearsal&quot;, Gielgud decided for &quot;Hamlet&quot; to be performed in a &#x27;rehearsal&#x27; version with an incomplete set with the actors performing wearing their own clothes. Unaccustomed to this freedom, the cast found it hard to select the appropriate clothes and wore different attire day by day. After the first performance in Toronto, Gielgud decreed that the actors must wear capes as he felt it &quot;lacked colour&quot;. In addition to being the play&#x27;s director, Gielgud appeared as the Ghost of Hamlet&#x27;s father. According to Gielgud&#x27;s biographer Jonathan Croall, Burton&#x27;s basic reading of Hamlet was &quot;a much more vigorous, extrovert&quot; version of Gielgud&#x27;s own performance in 1936. Burton varied his interpretations of the character in later performances; he even tried a homosexual Hamlet.

When the play debuted at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in New York City, Burton garnered good reviews for his portrayal of a &quot;bold and virile&quot; Hamlet. Howard Taubman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a performance of electrical power and sweeping virility&quot;, noting that he had never known or seen &quot;a Hamlet of such tempestuous manliness&quot;. A critic from &quot;Time&quot; magazine said that Burton &quot;put his passion into Hamlet&#x27;s language rather than the character. His acting is a technician&#x27;s marvel. His voice has gem-cutting precision.&quot; Walter Kerr felt that though Burton carried &quot;a certain lack of feeling&quot; in his performance, he appreciated Burton&#x27;s &quot;reverberating&quot; vocal projections. The opening night party was a lavish affair, attended by six hundred celebrities. The play ran for 137 performances, beating the previous record set by Gielgud himself in 1936. The most successful aspect of the production, apart from Burton&#x27;s performance, was generally considered to be Hume Cronyn&#x27;s performance as Polonius, winning him the only Tony Award he would ever receive in a competitive category. Burton himself was nominated for his second Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play but lost to Alec Guinness for his portrayal of the poet Dylan Thomas. The performance was immortalised in a film that was created by recording three live performances on camera from 30 June 1964 to 1 July 1964 using a process called Electronovision; it played in US theatres for a week in 1964. The play was also the subject of books written by cast members William Redfield and Richard L. Sterne.

Burton helped Taylor make her stage debut in &quot;A Poetry Reading&quot;, a recitation of poems by the couple as well as anecdotes and quotes from the plays Burton had participated in thus far. The idea was conceived by Burton as a benefit performance for his mentor Philip, whose conservatory, the American Musical and Dramatic Academy, had fallen short of funds. &quot;A Poetry Reading&quot; opened at the Lunt-Fontanne on 21 June 1964 to a packed house; the couple received a standing ovation at the end of their performance. Burton remarked on Taylor&#x27;s performance, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know she was going to be this good.&quot;

After &quot;Hamlet&quot; came to a close in August 1964, Burton and Taylor continued making films together. The first film after their marriage, &quot;The Sandpiper&quot;, was poorly received but still became a commercially successful venture. According to Bragg, the films they made during the mid-1960s contained a lot of innuendos that referred directly to their private lives. Burton went on to star opposite Claire Bloom and Oskar Werner in &quot;The Spy Who Came In from the Cold&quot; (1965), a Cold War espionage story about a British Intelligence agent, Alec Leamas (Burton), who is sent to East Germany on a mission to find and expose a mole working within his organisation for an East German Intelligence officer, Hans-Dieter Mundt (Peter van Eyck). Martin Ritt, the film&#x27;s director and producer, wanted Burton&#x27;s character to exhibit more anonymity, which meant no display of eloquent speeches or intense emotional moments. Bragg believed this decision worried Burton, as he had generated his reputation as an actor with those exact traits, and wondered how the film&#x27;s would turn out. Ritt, a non-drinker, was displeased with Burton&#x27;s drinking habits as he felt it &quot;lacked a certain discipline&quot; and expected the same level of commitment from him as everyone else during filming. In spite of their differences, Alpert notes that the film transpired well. Based on the 1963 novel of the same name by John le Carré, &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; garnered positive reviews, with Fernando F. Croce of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; describing Burton&#x27;s performance as more of &quot;tragic patsy than swashbuckler&quot; and believed his scenes with Werner &quot;have sharp doses of suspicion, cynicism and sadness&quot;. Dave Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; called the film &quot;Grim, monotonous, and rather facile&quot;, he found Burton&#x27;s role had &quot;some honest poignancy&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; thought Burton fitted &quot;neatly into the role of the apparently burned out British agent&quot;. Burton also made a brief appearance the same year in Clive Donner&#x27;s comedy &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot; as a man who meets the womaniser Michael James (O&#x27;Toole) in a bar.

In 1966, Burton and Taylor enjoyed their greatest on-screen success in Mike Nichols&#x27;s film version of Edward Albee&#x27;s black comedy play &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, in which a bitter erudite couple trade vicious barbs in front of their guests, Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis). Burton wanted Taylor for the character of Martha &quot;to stop everyone else from playing it&quot;. He didn&#x27;t want anyone else to do it as he thought it could be for Elizabeth what &quot;Hamlet&quot; was for him. Burton was not the first choice for the role of George. Jack Lemmon was offered the role initially, but when he turned it down, Warner Bros. president Jack L. Warner agreed on Burton and paid him $750,000. Nichols was hired to helm the project at Taylor&#x27;s request, despite having never directed a film. Albee preferred Bette Davis and James Mason for Martha and George respectively, fearing that the Burtons&#x27; strong screen presence would dominate the film. Instead, it proved to be what Alpert described as &quot;the summit of both Richard&#x27;s and Elizabeth&#x27;s careers&quot;.

The film&#x27;s script, adapted from Albee&#x27;s play by Ernest Lehman, broke new ground for its raw language and harsh depiction of marriage. So immersed had the Burtons become in the roles of George and Martha over the months of shooting that, after it was wrapped up, he and Taylor found it difficult not to be George and Martha, &quot;I feel rather lost.&quot; Later the couple would state that the film took its toll on their relationship, and that Taylor was &quot;tired of playing Martha&quot; in real life. &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; garnered critical acclaim, with film critic Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling it &quot;one of the most scathingly honest American films ever made&quot;. Kaufman observed Burton to be &quot;utterly convincing as a man with a great lake of nausea in him, on which he sails with regret and compulsive amusement&quot;, and Taylor &quot;does the best work of her career, sustained and urgent&quot;. In her review for &quot;The New York Daily News&quot;, Kate Cameron thought Taylor &quot;nothing less than brilliant as the shrewish, slovenly. blasphemous, frustrated, slightly wacky, alcoholic wife&quot; while noting that the film gave Burton &quot;a chance to display his disciplined art in the role of the victim of a wife&#x27;s vituperative tongue&quot;. However, Andrew Sarris of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; criticised Taylor, believing her performance &quot;lack[ed] genuine warmth&quot; but his review of Burton was more favourable, noting that he gave &quot;a performance of electrifying charm&quot;. Although all four actors received Academy Award nominations for their roles in the film, which received a total of thirteen nominations, only Taylor and Dennis went on to win. Both Burton and Taylor won their first BAFTA Awards for Best British Actor and Best British Actress respectively; the former also for his role in &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot;.

Burton and Taylor next performed a 1966 Oxford Playhouse adaptation of Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;; the couple did the play to benefit the Oxford University Dramatic Society and as a token of Burton&#x27;s gratitude to Nevill Coghill. Burton starred as the titular character, Doctor Faustus while Taylor played her first stage role as Helen of Troy, a non-speaking part. The play received negative reviews but Burton&#x27;s and Taylor&#x27;s performances were reviewed constructively. Irving Wardle of &quot;The Times&quot; called it &quot;University drama at its worst&quot; while the American newspaper columnist John Crosby, in his review for &quot;The Observer&quot;, lauded Burton&#x27;s speech where he asks God to be merciful, stating that: &quot;It takes a great actor to deliver that speech without wringing a strangled sob of laughter out of one. But Burton did it.&quot; The play nevertheless made $22,000, which Coghill was happy with. &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; was adapted for the screen the following year by both Burton and Coghill, with Burton making his directorial debut. He also co-produced the film with Taylor and Coghill; it was critically panned and was a box office failure. The couple&#x27;s next collaboration was Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s lively version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; (1967). The film was a challenge for Burton, who had to chase Taylor on rooftops, noting that he was &quot;permitted to do extreme physical things that wouldn&#x27;t have been allowed with any other actress&quot;. Zeffirelli recalled that Taylor, who had no prior experience performing in a Shakespeare play, &quot;gave the more interesting performance because she invented the part from scratch&quot;. Of Burton, the director felt he was, to an extent, &quot;affected by his knowledge of the classics&quot;. &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; also became a notable critical and commercial success. He had another quick collaboration with Zeffirelli narrating the documentary, &quot;&quot;, which was about the 1966 flood of the Arno that devastated the city of Florence, Italy; the film raised $20 million for the flood relief efforts. By the end of 1967, the combined box office gross of films Burton and Taylor had acted in had reached $200 million. According to biographers John Cottrell and Fergus Cashin, when Burton and Taylor contemplated taking a three-month break from acting, Hollywood &quot;almost had a nervous breakdown&quot; as nearly half the U.S. cinema industry&#x27;s income for films in theatrical distribution came from pictures starring one or both of them. Later collaborations from the Burtons like &quot;The Comedians&quot; (1967), which was based on Graham Greene&#x27;s 1966 novel of the same name, and the Tennessee Williams adaptation &quot;Boom!&quot; (1968) were critical and commercial failures.

In 1968, Burton enjoyed a commercial blockbuster with Clint Eastwood in the World War II action film &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;; he received a $1 million fee plus a share of the film&#x27;s box office gross. According to his daughter Kate Burton, &quot;He did that one for us kids, because we kept asking him, &#x27;Can you do a fun movie that we can go see?″&quot; Eastwood thought the script &quot;terrible&quot; and was &quot;all exposition and complications&quot;. He asked the film&#x27;s producer Elliott Kastner and its screenwriter Alistair MacLean to be given less dialogue, later remarking &quot;I just stood around firing my machine gun while Burton handled the dialogue.&quot; Burton enjoyed working with Eastwood and said of the picture that he &quot;did all the talking and [Eastwood] did all the killing&quot;. Burton&#x27;s last film of the decade, &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot; (1969) for which he was paid $1.25 million, () was commercially successful but garnered mixed opinions from reviewers. Noted British film critic Tom Milne of &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine believed that Burton &quot;plays throughout on a monotonous note of bluff ferocity&quot;. Conversely, Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; appreciated Burton&#x27;s portrayal of the English monarch, noting that he &quot;is in excellent form and voice—funny, loutish and sometimes wise&quot;. &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot; received ten nominations at the 42nd Academy Awards, including one for Burton&#x27;s performance as Henry VIII of England, which many thought to be largely the result of an expensive advertising campaign by Universal Studios. The same year, &quot;Staircase&quot; in which he and his &quot;Cleopatra&quot; co-star Rex Harrison appeared as a bickering homosexual couple, received negative reviews and was unsuccessful.

=== 1970–1984: Later career and final years ===

In 1970, on his 45th birthday, Burton was ceremonially honoured with a CBE at Buckingham Palace; Taylor and Cis were present during the ceremony. He attributed not having a knighthood to changing his residence from London to Céligny to escape taxes. From the 1970s, after his completion of &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot;, Burton began to work in mediocre films, which hurt his career. This was partly due to the Burtons&#x27; extravagant spending, his increasing addiction to alcohol, and his claim that he could not &quot;find any worthy material that is pertinent to our times&quot;. He recognised his financial need to work, and understood in the New Hollywood era of cinema, neither he nor Taylor would be paid as well as at the height of their stardom. Some of the films he made during this period include: &quot;Bluebeard&quot; (1972), &quot;Hammersmith Is Out&quot; (1972), &quot;Battle of Sutjeska&quot; (1973), &quot;The Klansman&quot; (1974), and &quot;Exorcist II: The Heretic&quot; (1977). His last film with Taylor was the two-part melodrama &quot;Divorce His, Divorce Hers&quot; (1973). He did enjoy one major critical success in the 1970s with the film version of his stage hit &quot;Equus&quot;, winning the Golden Globe Award as well as garnering an Academy Award nomination. Public sentiment towards his perennial frustration at not winning an Oscar made many pundits consider him the favourite to finally win the award, but he lost to Richard Dreyfuss in &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot;.

In 1976, Burton received a Grammy Award in the category of Best Recording for Children for his narration of &quot;The Little Prince&quot; by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. His narration of &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s Musical Version of The War of the Worlds&quot; became such a necessary part of the concept album that a hologram of Burton was used to narrate the live stage show (touring in 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010) of the musical. In 2011, however, Liam Neeson was cast in the part for a &quot;New Generation&quot; re-recording, and replaced Burton as the hologram character in the stage show.

Burton had an international box-office hit with &quot;The Wild Geese&quot; (1978), an adventure tale about mercenaries in Africa. The film was a success in Europe but had only limited distribution in the United States owing to the collapse of the studio that distributed it. He returned to films with &quot;The Medusa Touch&quot; (1978), &quot;Circle of Two&quot; (1980), and the title role in &quot;Wagner&quot; (1983). His last film performance as O&#x27;Brien in &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1984) was critically acclaimed though he was not the first choice for the role. According to the film&#x27;s director, Michael Radford, Paul Scofield was originally contracted to play the part, but had to withdraw due to a broken leg; Sean Connery, Marlon Brando and Rod Steiger were all approached before Burton was cast. He had &quot;heard stories&quot; about Burton&#x27;s heavy drinking, which had concerned the producers.

Burton&#x27;s last acting appearance was in the miniseries &quot;Ellis Island&quot;, which aired posthumously on CBS in November 1984. At the time of his death, he was preparing to film &quot;Wild Geese II&quot;, the sequel to &quot;The Wild Geese&quot;, which was eventually released in 1985. Burton was to reprise the role of Colonel Faulkner, while Laurence Olivier was cast as Rudolf Hess. After his death, Burton was replaced by Edward Fox, and the character changed to Faulkner&#x27;s younger brother.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages and relationships ===
Burton was married five times, twice consecutively to Taylor. From 1949 until 1963, he was married to Sybil Williams, with whom he had two daughters, Kate (born 1957) and Jessica Burton (born 1959).

Burton&#x27;s marriages to Taylor lasted from 15 March 1964 to 26 June 1974 and from 10 October 1975 to 29 July 1976. Their first wedding was at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Montreal. Of their marriage, Taylor proclaimed, &quot;I&#x27;m so happy you can&#x27;t believe it. This marriage will last forever.&quot; Their second wedding took place 16 months after their divorce, in Chobe National Park in Botswana. Taylor and Eddie Fisher adopted a daughter from Germany, Maria McKeown (born 1961), who was re-adopted by Burton after he and Taylor married. Burton also re-adopted Taylor and producer Mike Todd&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth Frances &quot;Liza&quot; Todd (born 1957), who had been first adopted by Fisher.

The relationship Burton and Taylor portrayed in the film &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; was popularly likened to their real-life marriage. Burton disagreed with others about Taylor&#x27;s famed beauty, saying that calling her &quot;the most beautiful woman in the world is absolute nonsense. She has wonderful eyes, but she has a double chin and an overdeveloped chest, and she&#x27;s rather short in the leg.&quot; In August 1976, a month after his second divorce from Taylor, Burton married model Suzy Miller, the former wife of Formula 1 Champion James Hunt; the marriage ended in divorce in 1982. From 1983 until his death in 1984, Burton was married to a freelance production assistant Sally Hay.

In 1974, between his divorce from and remarriage to Taylor, he was briefly engaged to Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia.

In 1957, Burton had earned a total of £82,000 from &quot;Prince of Players&quot;, &quot;The Rains of Ranchipur&quot; and &quot;Alexander the Great&quot;, but only managed to keep £6,000 for personal expenses due to taxation imposed by the then-ruling Conservative government. As a result, he consulted his lawyer, Aaron Frosch, who suggested he move to Switzerland where the tax payment was comparatively less. Burton acceded to Frosch&#x27;s suggestion and moved with Sybil in January 1957 to Céligny, Switzerland, where he purchased a villa. In response to criticism from the British government, Burton remarked: &quot;I believe that everyone should pay them — except actors.&quot; Burton lived there until his death. In 1968, Burton&#x27;s elder brother, Ifor, slipped and fell, breaking his neck, after a lengthy drinking session with Burton in Céligny. The injury left him paralysed from the neck down. His younger brother Graham Jenkins speculated that guilt over this may have caused Burton to start drinking very heavily, particularly after Ifor died in 1972.

In a February 1975 interview with his friend David Lewin, he said he &quot;tried&quot; homosexuality. He also suggested that perhaps all actors were latent homosexuals, and &quot;we cover it up with drink&quot;. In 2000, Ellis Amburn&#x27;s biography of Elizabeth Taylor suggested that Burton had an affair with Olivier and tried to seduce Eddie Fisher, although this was strongly denied by Burton&#x27;s younger brother Graham Jenkins.

Burton admired and was inspired by the actor and dramatist Emlyn Williams. He employed his son, Brook Williams, as his personal assistant and adviser, and he was given small roles in some of the films in which Burton starred.

=== Personal views ===
In November 1974, Burton was banned permanently from BBC productions for writing two newspaper articles questioning the sanity of Winston Churchill and others in power during World War II. Burton reported hating them &quot;virulently&quot; for the alleged promise to wipe out all Japanese people on the planet. The publication of these articles coincided with what would have been the 100th year since Churchill&#x27;s birth and came after Burton had played him in a favourable light in &quot;A Walk with Destiny&quot;.

Politically Burton was a lifelong socialist, although he was never as heavily involved in politics as his close friend Stanley Baker. He admired Democratic Senator Robert F. Kennedy and once got into a sonnet-quoting contest with him. 

In 1972, Burton played Leon Trotsky in &quot;The Assassination of Trotsky.&quot; The next year, he agreed to play Josip Broz Tito in a film biography, since he admired the Yugoslav leader. While filming in Yugoslavia he publicly proclaimed that he was a communist, saying he felt no contradiction between earning vast sums of money for films and holding left-wing views since &quot;unlike capitalists, I don&#x27;t exploit other people&quot;.

On his religious views, Burton was an atheist, stating: &quot;I wish I could believe in a God of some kind but I simply cannot.&quot;

=== Health problems ===
Burton was a heavy smoker. In a December 1977 interview with Sir Ludovic Kennedy, Burton said he was smoking 60–100 cigarettes per day. According to his younger brother, as stated in Graham Jenkins&#x27;s 1988 book &quot;Richard Burton: My Brother&quot;, he smoked at least 100 cigarettes a day. After his father died from a cerebral haemorrhage in March 1957, Burton declined to attend his funeral. Burton was also an alcoholic most of his adult life. According to biographer Robert Sellers, &quot;At the height of his boozing in the mid-70s he was knocking back three to four bottles of hard liquor a day.&quot;

After nearly drinking himself to death during the shooting of &quot;The Klansman&quot; (1974), Burton dried out at Saint John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California. Burton was allegedly inebriated while making the movie, and many of his scenes had to be filmed with him sitting or lying down due to his inability to stand upright. In some scenes, he appears to slur his words or speak incoherently. Burton later said that he could not remember making the film. Co-star O. J. Simpson said &quot;There would be times when he couldn&#x27;t move&quot;.

According to his diaries, Burton used Antabuse to try to stop his excessive consumption of alcohol, which he blamed for wrecking his marriage to Taylor. Burton himself said of the time leading up to his near loss of life, &quot;I was fairly sloshed for five years. I was up there with John Barrymore and Robert Newton. The ghosts of them were looking over my shoulder.&quot; He said that he turned to the bottle for solace &quot;to burn up the flatness, the stale, empty, dull deadness that one feels when one goes offstage&quot;. The 1988 biography by Melvyn Bragg provides a detailed description of the many health issues that plagued Burton throughout his life. In his youth, Burton was known for being exceptionally strong and athletic.

By the age of 41, he had declined so far in health that by his own admission, his arms were thin and weak. He suffered from bursitis, possibly aggravated by faulty treatment, arthritis, dermatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, and kidney disease, as well as developing, by his mid-forties, a pronounced limp. How much of this was due to his intake of alcohol is impossible to ascertain, according to Bragg, because of Burton&#x27;s reluctance to be treated for alcoholism. In 1974, Burton spent six weeks in a clinic to recuperate from a period during which he had drunk three bottles of vodka a day. Health issues continued to plague him until his death.

=== Declining health and death ===

Burton died from intracerebral haemorrhage on 5 August 1984 at his home in Céligny, Switzerland, at the age of 58. Although his death was sudden, his health had been declining for several years, and he suffered from constant and severe neck pain. As early as March 1970, he had been warned that his liver was enlarged, and he was diagnosed with cirrhosis and kidney disease in April 1981.

Burton was buried at the Old Cemetery (&quot;Vieux Cimetière&quot;) of Céligny with a copy of Dylan Thomas&#x27;s poems. 

Burton left an estate worth US$4.58 million (). The bulk of his estate consisted of real estate, investments in three countries and works of art. Most of his estate was bequeathed to his widow.

== Acting credits and accolades ==
Burton received numerous accolades including a British Academy Film Award, two Golden Globe Awards, a Grammy Award, and two Tony Awards (including a Special Tony Award) as well as nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award. For his contributions to cinema, Burton was inducted posthumously into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2013 with a motion pictures star located at 6336 Hollywood Boulevard. For his contributions to theatre, Burton was inducted into the Theatre Hall of Fame.

Despite seven Academy Award nominations Burton failed to win an Oscar.

<text>Sir Thomas Jones Woodward (born Thomas John Woodward; 7 June 1940) is a Welsh singer. His career began with a string of top 10 hits in the 1960s and he has since toured regularly, with appearances in Las Vegas from 1967 to 2011. His voice has been described by AllMusic as a &quot;full-throated, robust baritone&quot;.

Jones&#x27;s performing range has included pop, R&amp;B, show tunes, country, dance, soul, and gospel. In 2008, the &quot;New York Times&quot; called him a &quot;musical shapeshifter [who could] slide from soulful rasp to pop croon, with a voice as husky as it was pretty&quot;. He has sold over 100 million records, with 36 Top 40 hits in the UK and 19 in the US, including &quot;It&#x27;s Not Unusual&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot;, the theme song for the James Bond film &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1965), &quot;Green, Green Grass of Home&quot;, &quot;Delilah&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s a Lady&quot;, &quot;Sex Bomb&quot;, and a cover of Prince&#x27;s &quot;Kiss&quot;.

Jones has also occasionally dabbled in acting, first making his debut in the lead role of the television film &quot;Pleasure Cove&quot; (1979). He also appeared as himself in Tim Burton&#x27;s film &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; (1996). In 1970, he received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy nomination for hosting the television series &quot;This Is Tom Jones&quot;. In 2012, he played his first dramatic acting role in an episode of &quot;Playhouse Presents&quot;. He received a Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1966, an MTV Video Music Award in 1989, and two Brit Awards: Best British Male in 2000 and Outstanding Contribution to Music in 2003. He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1998 and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2006 for services to music. He experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 2010s due to his role as a coach on the talent show &quot;The Voice UK&quot; (2012–2015, 2017–present).

==Early life==
Thomas John Woodward was born at 57 Kingsland Terrace in Treforest in Wales on 7 June 1940, the son of Freda Jones (1914–2003) and coal miner Thomas Woodward (1910–1981). He is primarily of English descent; his maternal grandfather was Welsh, his maternal grandmother was born in Wales to English parents from Somerset and Wiltshire, his English paternal grandfather was from Gloucestershire, and his English paternal grandmother was from Wiltshire. He attended Wood Road Infants School, Wood Road Junior School, and Pontypridd Central Secondary Modern School. He began singing at an early age; he would regularly sing at family gatherings, weddings, and in his school choir. He did not like school or sports, but gained confidence through his singing talent. At the age of 12, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. Many years later, he said, &quot;I spent two years in bed recovering. It was the worst time of my life.&quot; During this time, he could do little else but listen to music and draw.

==Career==
===Rise to fame===
Jones&#x27;s voice has been described as a &quot;full-throated, robust baritone&quot;. According to Jones himself, his young voice was a tenor voice. He said: &quot;What you lose on the top end, you gain on the bottom end. I used to be able to hit a top C when I was young now it&#x27;s a B flat.&quot; He became the frontman in 1963 for Tommy Scott and the Senators, a Welsh beat group. They soon gained a local following and reputation in South Wales. In 1964, the group recorded several solo tracks with producer Joe Meek, who took them to various record labels, but they had little success. Later that year, Decca producer Peter Sullivan saw Tommy Scott and the Senators performing in a club and directed them to manager Phil Solomon, but the partnership was short-lived.

The group continued playing gigs around South Wales. Gordon Mills met Jones, became his manager, and introduced him to London, where Mills worked in music. Mills renamed him &quot;Tom Jones&quot;, to exploit the popularity of the Academy Award-winning 1963 film.

Eventually, Mills got Jones a recording contract with Decca. His first single, &quot;Chills and Fever&quot;, was released in late 1964. It did not chart, but the follow-up, &quot;It&#x27;s Not Unusual&quot;, became an international hit after offshore pirate radio station Radio Caroline promoted it. The following year was the most prominent of Jones&#x27;s career, making him one of the most popular vocalists of the British Invasion. In early 1965, &quot;It&#x27;s Not Unusual&quot; reached No. 1 in the United Kingdom and the top ten in the United States. During 1965, Mills secured a number of film themes for Jones to record, including the James Bond film &quot;Thunderball&quot;, and &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot; (written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David). Jones was sceptical about the latter song when first approached about it. He said when it was offered to him, he felt it was &quot;sort of a backhanded compliment: &#x27;I&#x27;ve got to have you, but this is the song. Jones said it took convincing from Bacharach to perform &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot;:

Jones was awarded the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1966. During a filming break at Paramount Studios (1965) in Hollywood, Jones met Elvis Presley for the first time; he recalls Presley singing, &quot;With These Hands&quot; as he walked towards him from the film set. The two men became good friends.

In 1966, Jones&#x27;s popularity began to slip somewhat, causing Mills to reshape the singer&#x27;s image into that of a crooner. Jones also began to sing broader material. Jones soon topped UK charts and reached the top 40 in US charts. Over the next few years he scored a string of hits on both sides of the Atlantic, including &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Fall in Love Again&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Home&quot;, and &quot;Delilah&quot;, each of which reached No. 2 in the UK chart.

===1967 to 1987===
In 1967, Jones performed in Las Vegas for the first time, at the Flamingo. His performances and style of dress became part of his stage act, and increasingly featured his open, half-unbuttoned shirts and tight trousers. He soon chose to record less and focus on club performances. Jones played in Las Vegas at least one week each year until 2011.

Jones had an internationally successful television variety show titled &quot;This Is Tom Jones&quot; from 1969 to 1971. The Associated Television-produced show was worth a reported to Jones over three years. It was broadcast by ITV in the UK and by the American Broadcasting Company in the US. As a result of the show, Jones was nominated in 1970 for a &quot;best actor&quot; Golden Globe. From 1980 to 1981, he had a second television variety show, &quot;Tom Jones&quot;, which was produced in Vancouver, Canada, and lasted 24 episodes. Both television shows were the subject of litigation with the original licence holder C/F International. , C/F International was a secured judgment creditor of Classic World Productions and its principal, Darryl Payne, for approximately , and was the principal secured creditor at the time of the subsequent bankruptcy filing by the company. C/F International&#x27;s action against Classic World Productions and owner Darryl Payne was based on unpaid royalty payments from &quot;This Is Tom Jones&quot; and related recordings. &quot;This Is Tom Jones&quot; is sold on DVD by Time Life rather than by Classic World Productions or C/F International.

C/F International&#x27;s rights to later Tom Jones material were also disputed. In March 2007, Tom Jones and Tom Jones Enterprises sued C/F International to stop the company from licensing sound recordings made from the 1981 &quot;Tom Jones&quot; series. It was contended that any rights that C/F International had to license the &quot;Tom Jones&quot; show did not include the right to make and license separate recordings of the performances on the show, and that any rights that C/F International had in the &quot;Tom Jones&quot; show no longer existed because of numerous breaches of contract. Examples of contentious CDs are &quot;Live on the Tom Jones Show&quot;, released in 2006, and &quot;Greatest Hits Live&quot;, originally issued by C/F International in 1981 and later licensed to and issued by Prism Leisure Corporation as &quot;30 Greatest Hits – Live in Concert&quot;.

On 26 April 1970, CBS released the Raquel Welch television special &quot;Raquel!&quot; directed by David Winters, in it Jones is among guests.

In the 1970s, Jones toured with the female singing groups Quiet Elegance and the Blossoms as his backing groups. He had a number of hit singles, including &quot;She&#x27;s a Lady&quot;, &quot;Till&quot;, and &quot;The Young New Mexican Puppeteer&quot;, but in the mid-1970s his popularity declined. He did, however, have a big hit in 1976 with &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Stay Until Tomorrow&quot;, which went to No. 1 on the US country chart, No. 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 40 on the UK Singles Chart.

In 1972, he co-starred with Jennifer O&#x27;Neill in David Winters&#x27;s television special &quot;The Special London Bridge Special&quot;. Jones explained that he accepted to do the special because it allowed him to continue doing television without having the confinement of a series.

In 1976, Jones was set to make his film debut in the film &quot;Yockowald&quot;, in which he was to play a CIA assassin. The film was shelved after the production ran out of money three weeks into filming.

In 1979, Jones made his acting debut in &quot;Pleasure Cove&quot;, an ABC television film which was a pilot for a potential television series but was not picked up. In the film, he played a suave conman named Raymond Gordon staying at the holiday island resort of the title. His co-stars in the film included Constance Forslund, Tanya Roberts and David Hasselhoff. In 1984, he guest-starred in an episode of the television series &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; as an accountant who fantasises about living life as Dick Turpin.

In the early 1980s, Jones started to record country music. From 1980 to 1986, he had nine songs in the US country top 40, yet failed to crack the top 100 in the UK or the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Jones&#x27;s manager Gordon Mills died of cancer on 29 July 1986, and Jones&#x27;s son Mark became his manager.

In 1987, Tom Jones re-entered the singles chart with &quot;A Boy from Nowhere&quot;, which went to No. 2 in the UK. The following year, he covered Prince&#x27;s &quot;Kiss&quot; with Art of Noise. The song reached No. 5 in the UK and No. 31 in the US. The video for &quot;Kiss&quot; was played frequently on MTV and VH1, and won the MTV Video Music Award for Breakthrough Video.

===1990s resurgence===

Jones received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1989, located at 6608 Hollywood Boulevard, Los Angeles, California, in front of Frederick&#x27;s of Hollywood. He collaborated with Van Morrison on his album &quot;Carrying A Torch&quot;, released in 1991 on Dover Records, featuring Jones&#x27;s cover of Morrison&#x27;s title track. Partly recorded at Townhouse Studios in London, Morrison wrote and produced four songs for the album.

In 1992, he made his first appearance at the UK&#x27;s Glastonbury Festival, and in 1993 he appeared as himself in episodes of two popular US sitcoms, &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; (&quot;The&quot;) and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (&quot;Marge Gets a Job&quot;).

Jones signed with Interscope Records in 1993 and released the album &quot;The Lead and How to Swing It&quot; the following year. The first single, &quot;If I Only Knew&quot;, went to No. 11 in the UK. Jones performed the song at the 1994 MTV Europe Music Awards, for which he also served as host. In 1997 Jones recorded a cover of Randy Newman song &quot;You Can Leave Your Hat On&quot; for the soundtrack of &quot;The Full Monty&quot;.

In 1996, Jones appeared as himself in Tim Burton&#x27;s ensemble science-fiction comedy film &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot;. A scene in the film features him performing on stage when aliens attack and he manages to escape with a gun.

In 1999, Jones released the album &quot;Reload&quot;, a collection of cover duets with artists such as the Cardigans, Natalie Imbruglia, Cerys Matthews, Van Morrison, Mousse T, Portishead, Stereophonics and Robbie Williams. The album went to No. 1 in the UK and sold over 4 million copies worldwide. Five singles from &quot;Reload&quot; charted in the UK top 40. The single &quot;Sex Bomb&quot; was released in early 2000 and became the album&#x27;s biggest single, reaching No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart.

===Into the 21st century===
US President Bill Clinton invited Jones to perform on New Year&#x27;s Eve at the 2000 millennium celebrations in Washington, D.C. In 2000, Jones garnered a number of honours for his work, including a BRIT Award for Best British Male. He was also hired as the new voice of Australia&#x27;s National Rugby League, singing in an advertisement to market the 2000 season.

In 2002, Jones released the album &quot;Mr. Jones&quot;, which was produced by Haitian-American rapper Wyclef Jean. The album and the first single, &quot;Tom Jones International&quot;, were top 40 hits in the UK.

Jones received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music in 2003. The following year he performed &quot;You Can Leave Your Hat On&quot; with the Pussycat Dolls and Carmen Electra on the seventh annual &quot;Vh1 Divas&quot; concert. The only male guest part of that year&#x27;s lineup; which included Patti LaBelle, Gladys Knight, and Debbie Harry among many others; his cover of &quot;Kiss&quot; was included in an 80s finale medley. Later that year, he teamed up with pianist Jools Holland and released &quot;Tom Jones &amp; Jools Holland&quot;, a roots rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll album. It peaked at No. 5 in the UK.

On 28 May 2005, in celebration of his upcoming 65th birthday, Jones returned to his homeland to perform a concert in Ynysangharad Park, Pontypridd, before an audience of about 20,000. This was his first performance in Pontypridd since 1964. That same year, the BBC reported that Jones was Wales&#x27;s wealthiest entertainer, having amassed a fortune of £175,000,000. Jones collaborated with Australian pop singer John Farnham in 2005 and released the live album &quot;John Farnham &amp; Tom Jones – Together in Concert&quot;. The following year, Jones worked with Chicane and released the dance track &quot;Stoned in Love&quot;, which went to No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart.

Jones, who had been made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1999, was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2006 at Buckingham Palace for his services to music. After receiving a knighthood, Jones stated: &quot;When you first come into show business and get a hit record, it is the start of something. As time goes by it just gets better. This is the best thing I have had. It&#x27;s a wonderful feeling, a heady feeling.&quot;

===2007–2009===

On 1 July 2007, Jones was among the artists who performed at Wembley Stadium at the Concert for Diana, joined on stage by guitarist Joe Perry of Aerosmith and soul singer Joss Stone. In addition to performing some of his own songs, the group covered the Arctic Monkeys song &quot;I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor&quot;. A boxing fan, Jones has performed national anthems before a number of boxing matches. He sang &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, the national anthem of the United Kingdom, before the Floyd Mayweather-Ricky Hatton fight in 2007; he sang &quot;&quot;, the Welsh national anthem, at the Bernard Hopkins-Joe Calzaghe fight between fellow Welshman Joe Calzaghe and Bernard Hopkins in 2008; and he sang &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; before the Manny Pacquiao-Ricky Hatton fight in 2009.

In 2008, he released &quot;24 Hours&quot; on S-Curve Records, his first album of new material to be issued in the United States for over 15 years. Jones, who was still performing over 200 dates a year as he approached his seventieth birthday, set out on a world tour to promote the album. &quot;The fire is still in me. Not to be an oldie, but a goodie. I want to be a contender&quot;, Jones said. Also in 2008, Jones was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame. On 16 November 2008, he was invited to perform on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;; he performed the debut single from &quot;24 Hours&quot;, &quot;If He Should Ever Leave You&quot;, which was named the ninth-best song of 2008 by Spinner. One of the songs from &quot;24 Hours&quot;, &quot;Give a Little Love&quot;, would later be featured in the first trailer for the 2010 comedy film, &quot;Little Fockers&quot;.

In March 2009, Jones went to the top of the UK Music Charts for the third time in his career with a cover of &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;, sung with Ruth Jones, Rob Brydon and Robin Gibb, who co-wrote the original with his brothers Barry and Maurice. The record, which was inspired by the song&#x27;s having featured in the BBC&#x27;s hit sitcom &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot;, was released in aid of Comic Relief and reached No. 1 in March 2009. This was his first UK chart topper since &quot;Green, Green Grass of Home&quot; in 1967, setting a new record of 42 years between two UK number ones; this record would be surpassed by Kate Bush when &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; topped the charts in 2022, a 44-year gap between number ones.

===2010–2020===

Jones&#x27;s album &quot;Praise &amp; Blame&quot; was released on 26 July 2010. The album, consisting primarily of gospel and blues songs, included covers of songs by Bob Dylan, John Lee Hooker and Billy Joe Shaver, and featured guest musicians such as Booker T.

On 7 June 2010, which was Jones&#x27;s seventieth birthday, the single &quot;Burning Hell&quot;, a cover of the John Lee Hooker song from the &quot;Praise &amp; Blame&quot; album, was released. In July 2010, it was reported that David Sharpe, vice-president of Island Records (to whom Jones had moved, from EMI, for £1.5m in October 2009), had told his colleagues over email to &quot;pull back this project immediately or get my money back&quot; and asked whether the spiritually themed record had been a &quot;sick joke&quot;. Jones later strongly criticised Sharpe and said that he was furious about the leaked email.

In July 2010 Jones appeared on the penultimate episode of &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; and performed &quot;Burning Hell&quot;. In August 2010, &quot;Praise &amp; Blame&quot; debuted at No. 2 on the UK album chart. By 2010 Jones had sold a total of over 100 million records.

On 11 September 2010 Jones performed for an audience of 50,000 at the &quot;Help for Heroes&quot; charity concert at Twickenham Stadium performing &quot;Strange Things Are Happening Every Day&quot; and his hit &quot;Green, Green Grass of Home&quot;. On 22 September, Jones appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York.

In May 2011 Jones appeared as a guest vocalist on the debut album &quot;Let Them Talk&quot; by Hugh Laurie. On 15 May 2011, he appeared alongside Laurie in the UK ITV series &quot;Perspectives&quot;, singing music from the album in New Orleans. On 25 May 2011, he appeared on &quot; American Idol &quot; after a medley of his hits performed by the American Idol &quot;Top 13&quot;.

Jones released a single on 19 March 2012, produced by former White Stripes frontman Jack White, called &quot;Evil&quot;. The single was first made available through independent record shops in 7&quot; vinyl format on 5 March. An exclusive three-coloured vinyl was also sold at only one shop – Spillers Records in Cardiff. The shop, which Jones visited as a boy, was founded in 1894 and is listed in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s oldest record shop.

Jones experienced a resurgence in notability in the 2010s due to his coaching role on the BBC talent show &quot;The Voice UK&quot; from 2012 (with the exception of 2016). In March 2012 he became a coach on the show and was joined by will.i.am, Jessie J and Danny O&#x27;Donoghue. He mentored Leanne Mitchell to win the first series. Jones returned to coach in 2013, 2014 and 2015. In August 2015, it was announced that Jones&#x27;s contract with the show would not be renewed and that he would be replaced by Boy George. Jones criticised BBC executives for &quot;sub-standard behaviour&quot;, having not consulted with him and informing him only 24 hours before the official announcement.
In May 2012 Jones released the album &quot;Spirit in the Room&quot; on Island Records/Universal Music. The track listing included covers of songs by Paul McCartney, Paul Simon, Leonard Cohen and Richard and Linda Thompson, Blind Willie Johnson, Tom Waits and the Low Anthem. Also in May, he starred in a one-off television drama titled &quot;King of the Teds&quot; which aired on Sky Arts as part of a series of standalone teleplays for &quot;Playhouse Presents&quot;. On 4 June Jones performed at the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Concert in front of Buckingham Palace, singing &quot;Delilah&quot; and &quot;Mama Told Me Not to Come&quot;. On 18 August Jones performed a fifty-minute set at the V Festival&#x27;s Weston Park site in Staffordshire. On 9 September 2012, Jones headlined at BBC Radio 2&#x27;s Live in Hyde Park festival.

In May 2014 Jones opened for Morrissey at a special show in the United States. On 27 September 2014, Jones performed at the Australian Football League&#x27;s pre-game entertainment for the 2014 Grand Final along with Ed Sheeran.

In September 2015 Jones announced the long-awaited release of his album &quot;Long Lost Suitcase&quot;, on 9 October, through Virgin/EMI. The album was the last in a trilogy, following &quot;Praise &amp; Blame&quot; (2010) and &quot;Spirit in the Room&quot; (2012). The track titles are included in chapters of Jones&#x27; autobiography &quot;Over the Top and Back&quot; which was released at the same time. The album was produced by Ethan Johns and included songs by Gillian Welch, the Rolling Stones, Hank Williams and the Milk Carton Kids.

In November 2015 Jones appeared, alongside Rob Brydon, in a special 90-minute show, from the SSE Arena, Wembley, for BBC&#x27;s Children in Need. In December 2015 he appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Jools&#x27; Annual Hootenanny&quot;, on duetting with Paul Weller.

In 2017 Jones returned to &quot;The Voice&quot; as a coach for series 6. In 2018 he embarked on a live summer tour, which was planned to run from 1 May to 11 August. In July, however, many shows were cancelled due to sickness or bad weather.

In 2020 Jones again appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Jools&#x27; Annual Hootenanny&quot;, broadcast on New Year&#x27;s Eve, on which he duetted with Jools Holland and with Celeste.

===2021–present===
In January 2021 Jones announced &quot;Surrounded by Time&quot;, his fourth covers album to be produced by Ethan Johns, alongside the release of a new single, his rendition of Todd Snider&#x27;s &quot;Talking Reality Television Blues&quot;. In March he appeared on &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot; where he sang &quot;I&#x27;m Growing Old&quot; from that album. The album was released on 23 April.

On 17 and 18 June 2022 Jones appeared at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff alongside Stereophonics, whose Saturday concert was broadcast live on BBC Two.

On 3 September 2022, Jones performed &quot;I Won&#x27;t Crumble With You If You Fall&quot;, taken from his &quot;Surrounded by Time&quot; album, on &quot;The Voice UK&quot;. After the performance, Jones explained the meaning behind the song: &quot;My wife, she was dying of lung cancer [...] I was always able to fix stuff, I was always able to do things, if she needed me for anything I was always there, but she said &#x27;you can&#x27;t crumble with me, don&#x27;t fall with me now, you&#x27;ve done everything you can, you must carry on and do what you do&#x27; [...] When I heard it I thought, &#x27;My God it&#x27;s like this was written for this situation&#x27;. It&#x27;s a lovely song.&quot; Within 24 hours, the song had peaked on the UK iTunes chart at number 1. The song debuted at number 3 on the UK Official Singles Downloads Chart on 9 September 2022.

==Personal life==
Jones was married to his school girlfriend, Melinda Rose &quot;Linda&quot; Trenchard, from 2 March 1957 until her death from cancer on 10 April 2016. They were married at the age of 16 when she became pregnant; their son, Mark, was born shortly after the wedding. To support his young family, Jones worked in construction and at a glove factory before finding success as a singer. He stayed married to Trenchard despite his many well-publicised infidelities. After his wife&#x27;s death, Jones sold the family&#x27;s Los Angeles mansion and its contents (apart from treasured photos) and moved into an apartment in London, which was his wife&#x27;s dying wish.

Jones has stated that he had sex with up to 250 groupies a year at his peak of fame. He had affairs with famous American women such as singer Mary Wilson, presenter Charlotte Laws, and former Miss World Marjorie Wallace. Actress Cassandra Peterson (better known as her character Elvira, Mistress of the Dark) revealed in 2008 that she lost her virginity to Jones, calling the experience &quot;painful and horrible&quot; and stating that she required stitches afterwards. One of his affairs resulted in a son. While on tour in the United States in October 1987, he had a brief relationship with model Katherine Berkery, who later discovered she was pregnant. After a legal battle that included DNA testing, a U.S. court ruled in 1989 that Jones was the boy&#x27;s father. He denied the court&#x27;s findings until 2008, when he admitted they were true but expressed no interest in meeting his son, singer Jonathan Berkery.

Following the UK&#x27;s 1974 election of a Labour government, Jones became a tax exile to avoid a 98% income tax. In 1976, he purchased the mansion at 363 Copa De Oro Road in the East Gate Bel Air area of Los Angeles from Dean Martin for $500,000. He sold it to Nicolas Cage in 1998 for a reported $6.4 million.

Jones met his idol Elvis Presley in 1965 at the Paramount film stage, when Elvis was filming &quot;Paradise, Hawaiian Style&quot;. They became good friends, spending more time together in Las Vegas singing and carousing until the early hours at Presley&#x27;s private suite. The friendship endured until Presley&#x27;s death in 1977. One year after the death of Jones&#x27; wife, rumours began that he had started dating Presley&#x27;s wife Priscilla. In 2021, he said they had known each other since the 1960s and simply enjoyed spending time together. People had thought they were dating because they had been seen together dining and at Jeff Franklin&#x27;s house.

In 2015, Jones&#x27; autobiography &quot;Over the Top and Back&quot; was published by Michael Joseph. Reviewing the book in the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, Clair Woodward said, &quot;In the tradition of so many autobiographies these days, Tom Jones&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t tell you what you really want to hear. [...] What you are left with is a riotously enjoyable story of Jones &#x27;The Voice&#x27; which nicely doubles as the story of British pop and light entertainment from the Sixties onwards.&quot; In 2021, Jones revealed that he uses inversion therapy to stay in good health.

==Artistry and influence==
Jones&#x27; singing style developed out of the sound of American soul music. His early influences included blues, R&amp;B, and rock and roll singers such as Little Richard, Solomon Burke, Jackie Wilson, Brook Benton, Elvis Presley (his idol and later close friend), and Jerry Lee Lewis.

Space and Cerys Matthews released &quot;The Ballad of Tom Jones&quot;, a song about a fighting couple who are calmed down by listening to Jones&#x27;s music on the radio. The song reached No. 4 in the UK in 1998.

A musical, &quot;Tom: A Story of Tom Jones&quot;, based on his life and recordings, produced by Theatr na nÓg, opened at the Wales Millennium Centre in March 2016. Another jukebox musical, &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot; based on Henry Fielding&#x27;s 1749 novel &quot;The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling&quot; (set in the 1960s) which uses Jones&#x27; music opened at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in October 2021 to critical acclaim. It is written by Joe DiPietro, directed by Luke Sheppard, and choreographed by Arlene Phillips.

Similar to Presley with his impersonators, Jones has his own imitators around the world.

In the 2006 film &quot;Flushed Away&quot;, the main character, Roddy, is mistaken for Jones by another character while Roddy performs &quot;She&#x27;s a Lady&quot;. Jones&#x27; song, &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot;, is played during the ending credits.

In the video game &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;, the Scout character is a collector of Tom Jones merchandise, and Jones is depicted being murdered by the Soldier character in the tie-in comics. The Spy character later uses his shape-shifting ability to convince the Scout that Jones is his father. Jones is also depicted using the phrase &quot;What&#x27;s new pussycat?&quot; several times.

<doc id="45969" wikidata="Q40475" url="?curid=45969" title="Joan Crawford">
<text>Joan Crawford (born Lucille Fay LeSueur; March 23, 190? was an American actress. She started her career as a dancer in traveling theatrical companies before debuting on Broadway. Crawford was signed to a motion picture contract by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1925. Initially frustrated by the size and quality of her parts, Crawford launched a publicity campaign and built an image as a nationally known flapper by the end of the 1920s. By the 1930s, Crawford&#x27;s fame rivaled MGM colleagues Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo. Crawford often played hardworking young women who find romance and financial success. These &quot;rags-to-riches&quot; stories were well received by Depression-era audiences and were popular with women. Crawford became one of Hollywood&#x27;s most prominent movie stars and one of the highest paid women in the United States, but her films began losing money. By the end of the 1930s, she was labeled &quot;box office poison&quot;.

After an absence of nearly two years from the screen, Crawford staged a comeback by starring in &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; (1945), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. In 1955, she became involved with the Pepsi-Cola Company, through her marriage to company president Alfred Steele. After his death in 1959, Crawford was elected to fill his vacancy on the board of directors but was forced to retire in 1973. She continued acting in film and television regularly through the 1960s, when her performances became fewer; after the release of the horror film &quot;Trog&quot; in 1970, Crawford retired from the screen. She withdrew from public life and became increasingly reclusive until her death in 1977.

Crawford married four times. Her first three marriages ended in divorce; the last ended with the death of husband Al Steele. She adopted five children, one of whom was reclaimed by his birth mother. Crawford&#x27;s relationships with her two older children, Christina and Christopher, were acrimonious. Crawford disinherited the two and, after Crawford&#x27;s death, Christina published the tell-all memoir &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;.

==Career==
===Early career===

Under the name Lucille LeSueur, Crawford began dancing in the choruses of traveling revues, and was spotted dancing in Detroit by producer Jacob J. Shubert. Shubert put her in the chorus line for his 1924 show, &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot;, at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway in New York City. While appearing in &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot;, Crawford met a saxophone player named James Welton. The two were allegedly married in 1924, and lived together for several months, although this supposed marriage was never mentioned in later life by Crawford.

Crawford wanted additional work, and approached Loews Theaters publicist Nils Granlund. Granlund secured a position for her with singer Harry Richman&#x27;s act and arranged for her to do a screen test, which he sent to producer Harry Rapf in Hollywood. Rapf notified Granlund on December 24, 1924, that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) had offered Crawford a contract at $75 a week. Granlund immediately wired Crawford, who had returned to her mother&#x27;s home in Kansas City, with the news; she borrowed $400 for travel expenses.

Credited as Lucille LeSueur, her first film was &quot;Lady of the Night&quot; in 1925, as the body double for Norma Shearer, MGM&#x27;s most popular female star. She also appeared in &quot;The Circle&quot; and &quot;Pretty Ladies&quot; (both 1925), starring comedian ZaSu Pitts. This was soon followed by equally small and unbilled roles in two other 1925 silent films: &quot;The Only Thing&quot;, and &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;.

MGM publicity head Pete Smith recognized her ability to become a major star, but felt her name sounded fake; he told studio head Louis B. Mayer that her last name, LeSueur, reminded him of a sewer. Smith organized a contest called &quot;Name the Star&quot; in &quot;Movie Weekly&quot; to allow readers to select her new stage name. The initial choice was &quot;Joan Arden&quot;, but after another actress was found to have prior claim to that name, the alternative surname &quot;Crawford&quot; became the choice. She later said that she wanted her first name to be pronounced Jo-Anne, and that she hated the name Crawford because it sounded like &quot;crawfish&quot;, but also admitted she &quot;liked the security&quot; that went with the name.

===Self-promotion and early successes===

Growing increasingly frustrated over the size and quality of the parts she was given, Crawford embarked on a campaign of self-promotion. As MGM screenwriter Frederica Sagor Maas recalled, &quot;No one decided to make Joan Crawford a star. Joan Crawford became a star because Joan Crawford decided to become a star.&quot; She began attending dances in the afternoons and evenings at hotels around Hollywood and at dance venues on the beach piers, where she often won dance competitions with her performances of the Charleston and the Black Bottom.

Her strategy worked and MGM cast her in the film where she first made an impression on audiences, Edmund Goulding&#x27;s &quot;Sally, Irene and Mary&quot; (1925). From the beginning of her career, Crawford considered Norma Shearer – the studio&#x27;s most-popular actress – her professional nemesis. Shearer was married to MGM Head of Production Irving Thalberg; hence, she had the first choice of scripts, and had more control than other stars in what films she would and would not make. Crawford was quoted to have said: &quot;How can I compete with Norma? She sleeps with the boss!&quot;

Crawford was named one of 1926&#x27;s WAMPAS Baby Stars, along with Mary Astor, Dolores del Río, Janet Gaynor, and Fay Wray, among others. That same year, she co-starred in &quot;Paris&quot; with Charles Ray. Within a few years, she became the romantic lead to many of MGM&#x27;s top male stars, including Ramón Novarro, John Gilbert, William Haines, and Tim McCoy.

Crawford appeared as a skimpily clad young carnival assistant in &quot;The Unknown&quot; (1927), starring Lon Chaney, Sr. as a carnival knife thrower with no arms who hopes to marry her. She stated that she learned more about acting from watching Chaney work than from anyone else in her career. &quot;It was then&quot;, she said, &quot;I became aware for the first time of the difference between standing in front of a camera, and acting.&quot; Also in 1927, she appeared alongside her close friend, William Haines, in &quot;Spring Fever&quot;, which was the first of three movies the duo made together.

In 1928, Crawford starred opposite Ramón Novarro in &quot;Across to Singapore&quot;, but it was her role as Diana Medford in &quot;Our Dancing Daughters&quot; (1928) that catapulted her to stardom. The role established her as a symbol of modern 1920s-style femininity who rivaled Clara Bow, the original It girl, and Hollywood&#x27;s foremost flapper. A stream of hits followed &quot;Our Dancing Daughters&quot;, including two more flapper-themed movies, in which Crawford embodied for her legion of fans (many of whom were women) an idealized vision of the free-spirited, all-American girl.

F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote of Crawford:

Crawford described her glamorous onscreen persona more succinctly, saying, &quot;If you want to see the girl next door, go next door.&quot;

===Transition to sound and continued success===

After the release of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; in 1927—the first feature-length film with some audible dialogue—sound films became all the rage. The transition from silent to sound caused panic for many, if not all, involved with the film industry; many silent film stars found themselves unemployable because of their undesirable voices and hard-to-understand accents, or simply because of their refusal to make the transition to talkies. Many studios and stars avoided making the transition as long as possible, especially MGM, which was the last of the major studios to switch over to sound. &quot;The Hollywood Revue of 1929&quot; was one of the studio&#x27;s first all-talking films, and their first attempt to showcase their stars&#x27; ability to make the transition from silent to sound. Crawford was among the dozen or more MGM stars included in the movie; she sang the song &quot;Got a Feeling for You&quot; during the film&#x27;s first act. She studied singing with Estelle Liebling, the voice teacher of Beverly Sills, in the 1920s and 1930s.

To rid herself of her Southwestern accent, Crawford tirelessly practiced diction and elocution. She said:
Crawford made a successful transition to talkies with her first starring role in the all-talking feature-length film &quot;Untamed&quot; (1929), co-starring Robert Montgomery. Despite the success of the film at the box office, it received mixed reviews from critics, who noted that while Crawford seemed nervous at making the transition to sound, she had become one of the most popular actresses in the world.&quot; Montana Moon&quot; (1930), an uneasy mix of Western clichés and music, teamed her with John Mack Brown and Ricardo Cortez. Although the film had problems with censors, it was a major success at the time of its release. &quot;Our Blushing Brides&quot; (1930), the final installment in the &quot;Our Dancing Daughters&quot; franchise co-starring Robert Armstrong and Anita Page, where Crawford &quot;carries the burden of dramatics in this photoplay and comes off splendidly and intelligently.&quot;

Her next movie, &quot;Paid&quot; (1930), paired her with Robert Armstrong, and was another success. During the early sound era, MGM began to place Crawford in more sophisticated roles, rather than continuing to promote her flapper-inspired persona of the silent era. In 1931, MGM cast Crawford in five films. Three of them teamed her opposite Clark Gable, the studio&#x27;s soon-to-be biggest male star and &quot;King of Hollywood&quot;. &quot;Dance, Fools, Dance&quot;, released in February 1931, was the first pairing of Crawford and Gable. Their second movie together, &quot;Laughing Sinners&quot;, released in May 1931, was directed by Harry Beaumont and also co-starred Neil Hamilton. &quot;Possessed&quot;, their third film together, released in October, was directed by Clarence Brown. These films were immensely popular with audiences and were generally well received by critics, establishing Crawford&#x27;s position as one of MGM&#x27;s top female stars of the decade along with Norma Shearer, Greta Garbo and Jean Harlow. Her only other notable film of 1931, &quot;This Modern Age&quot;, was released in August and despite unfavorable reviews was a moderate success.
MGM next cast her in the film &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;, directed by Edmund Goulding. As the studio&#x27;s first all-star production, Crawford co-starred opposite Greta Garbo, John and Lionel Barrymore, and Wallace Beery, among others. Receiving third billing, she played the middle-class stenographer to Beery&#x27;s controlling general director. Crawford later admitted to being nervous during the filming of the movie because she was working with accomplished actors, and that she was disappointed that she had no scenes with one she had admired, the &quot;divine Garbo&quot;. &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; was released in April 1932 to critical and commercial success. It was one of the highest-grossing movies of the year, and won the Academy Award for Best Picture.

Crawford achieved continued success in &quot;Letty Lynton&quot; (1932). Soon after this movie&#x27;s release, a plagiarism suit forced MGM to withdraw it; it is therefore considered the &quot;lost&quot; Crawford film. Designed by Adrian, the gown with large ruffled sleeves which Crawford wore in the movie became a popular style that same year, and was even copied by Macy&#x27;s. On loan to United Artists, she played prostitute Sadie Thompson in &quot;Rain&quot; (1932), a film version of John Colton&#x27;s 1923 play. Actress Jeanne Eagels played the role on stage, and Gloria Swanson had originated the part on screen in the 1928 film version. Crawford&#x27;s performance was panned, and the film was not a success. Despite the failure of &quot;Rain&quot;, in 1932, the publishing of the first &quot;Top Ten Money-Making Stars Poll&quot; placed Crawford third in popularity at the box office, behind only Marie Dressler and Janet Gaynor. She remained on the list for the next several years, last appearing on it in 1936.

She was again teamed with Clark Gable, along with Franchot Tone and Fred Astaire, in the hit &quot;Dancing Lady&quot; (1933), in which she received top billing. She next played the title role in &quot;Sadie McKee&quot; (1934), opposite Tone and Gene Raymond. She was paired with Gable for the fifth time in &quot;Chained&quot;, and for the sixth time in &quot;Forsaking All Others&quot; (both 1934). Crawford&#x27;s films of this era were some of the most-popular and highest-grossing films of the mid-1930s.

Crawford continued her reign as a popular movie actress well into the mid-1930s. &quot;No More Ladies&quot; (1935) co-starred Robert Montgomery and then-husband Franchot Tone, and was a success. Crawford had long pleaded with MGM&#x27;s head Louis B. Mayer to cast her in more dramatic roles, and although he was reluctant, he cast her in the sophisticated comedy-drama &quot;I Live My Life&quot; (1935), directed by W. S. Van Dyke, and it was well received by critics.

She next starred in &quot;The Gorgeous Hussy&quot; (1936), opposite Robert Taylor and Lionel Barrymore, as well as Tone. It was a critical and box-office success, and became one of Crawford&#x27;s biggest hits of the decade. &quot;Love on the Run&quot; (1936), a romantic comedy directed by W. S. Van Dyke, was her seventh film co-starring Clark Gable.

===Career decline at MGM===

Even though Crawford remained a respected MGM actress, and her films still earned profits, her popularity declined in the late 1930s. In 1937, Crawford was proclaimed the first &quot;Queen of the Movies&quot; by &quot;Life&quot; magazine. She unexpectedly slipped from seventh to sixteenth place at the box office that year, and her public popularity also began to wane. Richard Boleslawski&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;The Last of Mrs. Cheyney&quot; (1937) teamed her opposite William Powell in their sole screen pairing. The film was also Crawford&#x27;s last box-office success before the onset of her &quot;box office poison&quot; period.

She co-starred opposite Franchot Tone for the seventh—and final—time in &quot;The Bride Wore Red&quot; (1937). &quot;Mannequin&quot;, co-starring Spencer Tracy, also released in 1937 did, as the &quot;New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;restore Crawford to her throne as queen of the working girls&quot;. On May 3, 1938, Crawford—along with Greta Garbo, Mae West, Edward Arnold, Marlene Dietrich, Katharine Hepburn, and Kay Francis—was dubbed &quot;Box Office Poison&quot; in an advertisement in the &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot;. The list was submitted by Harry Brandt, president of the Independent Theatre Owners Association of America. Brandt stated that while these stars had &quot;unquestioned&quot; dramatic abilities, their high salaries did not reflect in their ticket sales, thus hurting the movie exhibitors involved. (Later, an article in the &quot;Independent Film Journal&quot;, stated that some of the other stars considered Box Office Poison included Norma Shearer, Dolores del Rio, Fred Astaire, John Barrymore and Luise Rainer). Crawford&#x27;s follow-up movie, Frank Borzage&#x27;s &quot;The Shining Hour&quot; (1938), also starring Margaret Sullavan and Melvyn Douglas, was well received by critics, but it was a box-office flop.

She made a comeback in 1939 with her role as home-wrecker Crystal Allen in &quot;The Women&quot;, opposite her professional nemesis, Norma Shearer. A year later, she played against type in the unglamorous role of Julie in &quot;Strange Cargo&quot; (1940), her eighth—and final—film with Clark Gable. She later starred as a facially disfigured blackmailer in &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Face&quot; (1941), a remake of the Swedish film &quot;En kvinnas ansikte&quot; which had starred Ingrid Bergman in the lead role three years earlier. While the film was only a moderate box office success, Crawford&#x27;s performance was hailed by many critics.

After 18 years, Crawford requested to be released from her contract with MGM, which was terminated by mutual consent on June 29, 1943. In lieu of the last film remaining under her contract, MGM bought her out for $100,000.

===Move to Warner Bros.===
For $500,000, Crawford signed with Warner Bros. for a three-movie deal, and was placed on the payroll on July 1, 1943. Her first film for the studio was &quot;Hollywood Canteen&quot; (1944), an all-star morale-booster film that teamed her with several other top movie stars at the time. 

She wanted to play the title role in &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; (1945), but director Michael Curtiz instead lobbied for the casting of Barbara Stanwyck. Curtiz demanded Crawford prove her suitability by taking a screen test; she agreed and ultimately received the role. &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; was a resounding critical and commercial success. It epitomized the lush visual style and the hard-boiled film noir sensibility that defined Warner Bros. movies of the late forties. Crawford earned the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.

The success of &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; revived Crawford&#x27;s film career. Her next film was &quot;Humoresque&quot; (1946), co-starring John Garfield. She starred alongside Van Heflin in &quot;Possessed&quot; (1947), for which she received a second Academy Award nomination for &quot;Best Actress.&quot; In &quot;Daisy Kenyon&quot; (1947), she appeared opposite Dana Andrews and Henry Fonda, and in &quot;Flamingo Road&quot; (1949), her character has an ultimately deadly feud with a corrupt southern sheriff played by Sydney Greenstreet. She made a cameo in &quot;It&#x27;s a Great Feeling&quot; (1949), poking fun at her own screen image. In 1950, she starred in the film noir &quot;The Damned Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; and in the melodrama &quot;Harriet Craig&quot;.
After the completion of &quot;This Woman Is Dangerous&quot; (1952), she asked to be released from her Warner Bros. contract. Later the same year, she received her third Academy Award nomination for &quot;Best Actress&quot; in &quot;Sudden Fear&quot; for RKO Radio Pictures.

===Radio and television===
Crawford worked in the radio series &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot; on January 8, 1939; &quot;Good News&quot;; &quot;Baby&quot;, broadcast on March 2, 1940, on Arch Oboler&#x27;s &quot;Lights Out&quot;; &quot;The Word&quot; on &quot;Everyman&#x27;s Theater&quot; (1941); &quot;Chained&quot; on the &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot;, and Norman Corwin&#x27;s &quot;Document A/777&quot; (1948). She appeared in episodes of anthology television series in the 1950s, and, in 1959, made a pilot for &quot;The Joan Crawford Show&quot;.

===Later career===

After her Academy Award-nominated performance in 1952&#x27;s &quot;Sudden Fear&quot;, Crawford continued to work steadily throughout the rest of the decade. After a 10-year absence from MGM, she returned to that studio to star in &quot;Torch Song&quot; (1953), a musical drama centering on the life of a demanding stage star who falls in love with a blind pianist, played by Michael Wilding.

In 1954, she starred in &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot;, a cult classic directed by Nicholas Ray, co-starring Sterling Hayden and Mercedes McCambridge. She also starred in &quot;Female on the Beach&quot; (1955) with Jeff Chandler, and in &quot;Queen Bee&quot; (1955), alongside John Ireland. The following year, she starred opposite a young Cliff Robertson in &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; (1956), and filmed a leading role in &quot;The Story of Esther Costello&quot; (1957), co-starring Rossano Brazzi.

Crawford, who had been left near-penniless following Alfred Steele&#x27;s death, accepted a small role in &quot;The Best of Everything&quot; (1959). Although she was not the star of the film, she received positive reviews. By 1961, Joan Crawford was once again her own publicity machine, with a new script, &quot;Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot;, sent by Robert Aldrich.

Crawford starred as Blanche Hudson, an elderly, disabled former A-list movie star who lives in fear of her psychotic sister Jane, in the highly successful psychological thriller &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; (1962). Despite the actresses&#x27; earlier tensions, Crawford reportedly suggested Bette Davis for the role of Jane. The two stars maintained publicly that there was no feud between them.

The film was a huge success, recouping its costs within eleven days of its nationwide release and reviving Crawford&#x27;s career. Davis was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Jane Hudson. 
In 1964, Crawford starred as Lucy Harbin in William Castle&#x27;s horror mystery &quot;Strait-Jacket&quot; (1964). During the same year, Aldrich reteamed Crawford and Davis in &quot;Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot; (1964). After a purported campaign of harassment by Davis on location in Louisiana, Crawford returned to Hollywood and entered a hospital. After a prolonged absence, Aldrich was forced to replace her with Olivia de Havilland. Crawford, who was devastated, said &quot;I heard the news of my replacement over the radio, lying in my hospital bed ... I cried for nine hours.&quot; Despite being replaced, brief footage of Crawford made it into the film when she is seen sitting in a taxi in a wide shot.
In 1965, she played Amy Nelson in &quot;I Saw What You Did&quot;, another William Castle vehicle. She starred as circus owner Monica Rivers in Herman Cohen&#x27;s thriller &quot;Berserk!&quot; (1967). After the film&#x27;s release, Crawford guest-starred as herself on &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. The episode, &quot;Lucy and the Lost Star&quot;, first aired on February 26, 1968. Crawford allegedly struggled during rehearsals, however, she was letter-perfect on the day of the show, which included dancing the Charleston, and received two standing ovations from the studio audience.

In October 1968, Crawford&#x27;s 29-year-old daughter, Christina (who was then acting in New York in the soap opera &quot;The Secret Storm&quot;), needed immediate medical attention for a ruptured ovarian tumor. Despite the fact that Christina&#x27;s character was a 28-year-old, Crawford played the role for one week.

Crawford&#x27;s appearance in the 1969 television film &quot;Night Gallery&quot; (which served as pilot to the series that followed) was the first occasion when Steven Spielberg directed a professional actor. Crawford made a cameo appearance as herself in the first episode of &quot;The Tim Conway Show&quot;, which aired on January 30, 1970. She starred on the big screen one final time, playing Dr. Brockton in Herman Cohen&#x27;s science fiction horror film &quot;Trog&quot; (1970), rounding out a career spanning 45 years and more than 80 motion pictures. Crawford made three more television appearances, including one as Stephanie White in a 1970 episode (&quot;The Nightmare&quot;) of &quot;The Virginian&quot;, and as Joan Fairchild (her final dramatic performance) in a 1972 episode (&quot;Dear Joan: We&#x27;re Going to Scare You to Death&quot;) of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Early life===
Born Lucille Fay LeSueur, of French-Huguenot, English, Dutch, and Irish ancestry in San Antonio, Texas, she was the second of the two children of Thomas E. LeSueur (born January 2, 1867, in Tennessee; died January 1, 1938), a construction worker, and Anna Bell Johnson (died August 15, 1958), later known as Anna Cassin. Crawford&#x27;s mother was likely under 20 when her first two children were born. Crawford had one sister, Daisy, and one brother, Hal LeSueur.

Thomas LeSueur abandoned the family when Lucille was ten months old, eventually resettling in Abilene, Texas, reportedly working in construction. In 1909, while working as a sales associate at Simpson&#x27;s, Crawford&#x27;s mother married Henry J. Cassin (1868–1922) in Fort Worth, who is incorrectly listed in the 1910 census as her second husband rather than her third. They lived in Lawton, Oklahoma, where Cassin ran the Ramsey Opera House, booking such diverse and noted performers as Anna Pavlova and Eva Tanguay. As a child, Crawford, who preferred the nickname &quot;Billie&quot;, enjoyed watching vaudeville acts perform on the stage of her stepfather&#x27;s theater. At that time, Crawford was reportedly unaware that Cassin, whom she called &quot;Daddy&quot;, was not her biological father; her brother later told her the truth.

From childhood, Crawford&#x27;s ambition was to be a dancer. One day, in an attempt to escape piano lessons, she leapt from the front porch of her home and cut her foot severely on a broken milk bottle. She had three surgeries to repair the damage, and for 18 months was unable to attend elementary school or continue dancing lessons.

In June 1917, the family moved to Kansas City, Missouri, after Cassin was accused of embezzlement; although acquitted, he was blacklisted in Lawton. After the move, Cassin, a Catholic, placed Crawford at St. Agnes Academy in Kansas City. When her mother and stepfather separated, she remained at school as a work student, where she spent far more time working, primarily cooking and cleaning, than studying. She later attended Rockingham Academy, also as a working student. While there, she began dating, and had her first serious relationship: a trumpet player, Ray Sterling, who reportedly inspired her to challenge herself academically.

In 1922, she registered at Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri, giving her year of birth as 1906. She attended Stephens for a few months and then withdrew after she realized that she was not ready for college. Due to her family&#x27;s instability, Crawford&#x27;s schooling never surpassed the primary level.

===Marriages===
On June 3, 1929, Crawford eloped with Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. at Saint Malachy&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church (known as &quot;The Actors&#x27; Chapel&quot;, owing to its proximity to Broadway theatres) in Manhattan, although neither was Catholic. Fairbanks was the son of Douglas Fairbanks and the stepson of Mary Pickford, who were considered Hollywood royalty. Fairbanks Sr. and Pickford were opposed to the sudden marriage, and did not invite the couple to their home at Pickfair for eight months after the marriage.

The relationship between Crawford and Fairbanks, Sr., eventually warmed; she called him &quot;Uncle Doug&quot;, and he called her &quot;Billie&quot;, her childhood nickname, but one that close friends used throughout her life. Following that first invitation, Crawford and Fairbanks, Jr., became more frequent guests. While the Fairbanks men played golf together, Crawford was either left with Pickford, who would retire to her quarters, or simply left alone.

In May 1933, Crawford divorced Fairbanks, citing &quot;grievous mental cruelty&quot;. Crawford claimed Fairbanks had &quot;a jealous and suspicious attitude&quot; toward her friends, and that they had &quot;loud arguments about the most trivial subjects&quot; lasting &quot;far into the night&quot;.

In 1935, Crawford married Franchot Tone, a stage actor from New York who planned to use his film earnings to finance his theatre group. The couple built a small theatre at Crawford&#x27;s Brentwood home, and put on productions of classic plays for select groups of friends who lived in the popular Brentwood area like Clark Gable and Charley Chase. Tone and Crawford had first appeared together in &quot;Today We Live&quot; (1933), but Crawford was hesitant about entering into another romance so soon after her split from Fairbanks.

Before and during their marriage, Crawford worked to promote Tone&#x27;s Hollywood career, but he was not interested in being a star, ultimately wanting to just be an actor, and Crawford wearied of the effort. During their marriage they tried on two separate occasions for children, both ending in miscarriage. Tone allegedly began drinking and became physically abusive. She filed for divorce, which was granted in 1939. Crawford and Tone later rekindled their friendship, and Tone even proposed in 1964 that they remarry. When he died in 1968, Crawford arranged for him to be cremated and his ashes scattered at Muskoka Lakes, Canada.

Crawford met actor Phillip Terry in June 1942 after press agent Harry Mines asked if he could bring Terry along for dinner at Crawford&#x27;s home. On July 21, 1942, the couple married 10 minutes after midnight at the home of Crawford&#x27;s lawyer, Neil McCarthy, by Judge Flynn, six weeks after their first date in San Fernando Valley. On December 16, 1945, Crawford and Terry separated. Later, on March 12, 1946, Crawford filed for divorce on &quot;grounds of cruelty&quot;. On April 25, they divorced.

Crawford married her fourth—and final—husband, Alfred Steele, at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas on May 10, 1955. Crawford and Steele met at a party in 1954. By that time, Steele had become president of Pepsi-Cola. He later was named chairman of the board of Pepsi-Cola. They remained married until his death in May 1959.

===Children===
Crawford adopted her first child, a daughter, in June 1940. Because she was single, California law prevented her from adopting within the state, so she arranged the adoption through an agency in Las Vegas. The child was temporarily called Joan, until Crawford changed her name to Christina. Christina&#x27;s birth mother was a 19-year-old unmarried girl who had moved to Los Angeles with her family. Christina&#x27;s birth mother contracted with a baby broker for Crawford to adopt her baby after its birth.

While married to Phillip Terry, the couple adopted a son (born Marcus Gary Kullberg on June 3, 1941, prior to changing his name to David Gary Deatherage) whom they named Christopher, but his birth mother learned the child had been adopted by a celebrity and attempted to blackmail Crawford for money, which resulted in Crawford giving the child back to his birth mother, who in turn placed him back up for adoption. The couple adopted another boy, whom they named Phillip Terry Jr. After the marriage ended in 1946, Crawford changed that child&#x27;s name to Christopher Crawford. Christopher died in 2006.

In 1947, Crawford adopted two fraternal twin daughters and named them Cathy and Cynthia &quot;Cindy&quot;. They were born prematurely on January 13, 1947, and required hospital supervision for several weeks. Cathy and Cynthia are the only children adopted by Crawford from the Tennessee Children&#x27;s Home Society. Their birth mother was ill and died less than a week after the twins were born due to kidney failure; their biological father abandoned their mother during birth. Their biological mother made the adoption arrangements before Cathy and Cindy were born.

Crawford&#x27;s fourth husband, Alfred Steele, took on the father-figure role of the children in 1955.

Cathy described her mother as wise, warm, realistic, caring, and a &quot;good friend&quot;. She attended Vernon Court Junior College, the Fashion Institute of Technology, and the International Fine Arts College. In November 1967, Crawford announced her daughter, Cathy, was engaged to Navy petty officer, Jerome Jon Lalonde. They met while Cathy was working part time as a waitress while attending college. They were married in Alexandria Bay on August 10, 1968. Herbert L. Barnet, then CEO of Pepsi Cola, gave Cathy away at the wedding. Cathy designed and sewed her own wedding dress. They had two children together. The couple separated in 1984, later divorcing. Cynthia married John Jordan and also had two children. They would eventually divorce.

In the 1990s, the twins reconnected with their biological family in Tennessee. Cynthia died on October 14, 2007. Cathy died on January 11, 2020, of lung cancer.

===Pepsi-Cola===
During her marriage to Alfred Steele, Crawford traveled extensively on behalf of Pepsi. Following Steele&#x27;s death on April 19, 1959, Crawford was elected as the first female to the board of directors and later took on the role of goodwill ambassador. In 1966, Crawford estimated that she traveled over a year for the company.

In 1963, Crawford received the Pepsi&#x27;s sixth annual &quot;Pally Award&quot;, which was in the shape of a bronze Pepsi bottle. It was awarded to the employee making the most significant contribution to company sales. In 1973, Crawford retired from Pepsi&#x27;s board of directors upon her official age of 65.

===Final years===
On February 2, 1970, Crawford was presented with the Cecil B. DeMille Award by John Wayne at the Golden Globes, held at the Coconut Grove at The Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. In 1970, she also spoke at Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri, where she had been a student for two months in 1922.

Crawford published her autobiography, &quot;A Portrait of Joan&quot;, co-written with Jane Kesner Ardmore, in 1962 through Doubleday. Crawford&#x27;s next book, &quot;My Way of Life&quot;, was published in 1971 by Simon &amp; Schuster.

Joan Crawford&#x27;s last official public appearance was on April 8, 1973, at Town Hall in Manhattan, New York. Crawford appeared as the fourth legend in John Springer&#x27;s &quot;Legendary Ladies&quot; series. The event was sold out, with the 1,500 seat venue filled to capacity. The audience watched a series of highlight scenes from Crawford&#x27;s screen career. Afterward, Crawford came on stage for a question-and-answer session with the audience. Upon Crawford&#x27;s departure, approximately 200 fans surrounded her limousine and would not let it move for several minutes.

In September 1973, Crawford moved from apartment 22-G to a smaller apartment next door, 22-H, at the Imperial House, 150 East 69th Street, New York City. Her last public appearance was made on September 23, 1974, at a book party co-hosted with her old friend Rosalind Russell at New York&#x27;s Rainbow Room, after which unflattering photographs were published.

==Death==
Crawford had a heart attack on May 10, 1977, and died in her apartment in Lenox Hill, New York City. Her age was reported as 69. Four days earlier on May 6, 1977, Crawford had given away her Shih Tzu, Princess Lotus Blossom, because she was too weak to continue to care for her.
A funeral was held at Campbell Funeral Home, New York, on May 13, 1977, and her cremated ashes were placed in a crypt at Ferncliff Cemetery and Mausoleum, Hartsdale, Westchester County, New York, next to her fourth and last husband Alfred Steele.

Disposing of her $2 million estate in her will, which had been signed on October 28, 1976, Crawford bequeathed $77,500 to each of her two youngest children, Cindy and Cathy, and $35,000 to her longtime friend and secretary Betty Barker, and smaller bequests to a few other people. Crawford also left money to her favorite charities: the United Service Organizations New York centre, the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital, the American Cancer Society, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the American Heart Association, and the Wiltwyck School for Boys.

She disinherited her two eldest children, Christina and Christopher, stating in her will: &quot;It is my intention to make no provision herein for my son, Christopher, or my daughter, Christina, for reasons which are well known to them.&quot; Both of them challenged the will and received a $55,000 settlement. She also bequeathed nothing to her niece, Joan Lowe (1933–1999; born Joan Crawford LeSueur, the only child of her estranged brother, Hal).

A memorial service was held for Crawford at All Souls&#x27; Unitarian Church on Lexington Avenue in New York on May 17, 1977. In attendance were long-time friend Myrna Loy and co-stars Geraldine Brooks and Cliff Robertson, who gave eulogies; Pearl Bailey sang &quot;He&#x27;ll Understand&quot;. Another memorial service, organized by George Cukor, was held on June 24 in the Samuel Goldwyn Theater at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills, California.

===Legacy===

Joan Crawford&#x27;s handprints and footprints were imprinted in a block in the forecourt of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood on September 14, 1929.

She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 1752 Vine Street, for her contributions to the motion picture industry.

In 1999, Crawford was voted the tenth-greatest female star of the classic American cinema by the American Film Institute.

&quot;Playboy&quot; listed Crawford as number 84 of the &quot;100 Sexiest Women of the 20th century&quot;.

Crawford has also attracted a following in the gay community. In &quot;Joan Crawford: The Essential Biography&quot;, the author wrote that Crawford appealed to many gay men because they sympathized with her struggle for success in both the entertainment industry and her personal life.

==Charity contributions==
Throughout her life, Crawford was heavily involved in charity work, as well as contributing to various efforts for service members. In the 1930s, Crawford was named one of the vice presidents on the board of the Motion Picture Relief Fund. Throughout the 1930s, Crawford supported the cause by promoting, donating, attending board meetings, and collecting contributions &quot;from actors and directors who were remiss&quot;. In 1938, Crawford, Adolphe Menjou, and Jackie Cooper were on the organization&#x27;s stamp committee whose goal was to raise money from used stamps. The sales from the stamps to collectors would benefit actors in need of aid. Crawford donated all her stamped envelopes from fan letters to the cause that year. In 1933, Crawford donated her large doll collection she had been collecting since the 1920s to a children&#x27;s hospital.

During World War II, Crawford did much to help in the war effort which included promoting the sale of war bonds to the public. In 1942, she began volunteering at the Hollywood Canteen in Los Angeles to entertain and serve service members. In 1943, she began volunteering for American Women&#x27;s Voluntary Services nurseries as a member by giving of her time and money to provide support service to the children of service members. During WWII, Crawford volunteered as the guarantor for English actor and writer, Margaret Chute. Chute required a guarantor to move from England to the United States during war.

In 1942, Crawford donated her entire $112,500 salary from &quot;They All Kissed the Bride&quot; to charities in memory of Carole Lombard. They included the American Red Cross ($50,000) which helped in recovery efforts following Lombard&#x27;s death, the Infantile Paralysis Drive ($25,000), Motion Picture Relief ($25,000), and the Navy Relief Fund ($12,500).

In June 1952, Crawford travelled to Fort Worth and Dallas, Texas for charity and helped raise thousands of dollars, shook hands, and met with 575 people in one night. In 1955, she donated some of her clothes for auction to support the Boys Republic, a rehabilitation centre for teenagers. Crawford was also named Chairman of the &quot;1959 National Multiple Sclerosis Society Fund campaign&quot;, renamed the &quot;Alfred N. Steele Memorial Campaign for the MS Hope Chest&quot; following Steele&#x27;s death in May 1959.

In the 1960s, Crawford sponsored the Philadelphia Cotillion Society&#x27;s annual Christmas Cotillion, aimed at raising funds for Heritage House and the NAACP.

In 1965, the U.S.O. named Crawford the &quot;Woman of The Year&quot; for her ongoing contributions to the organization and the support of American service members. Crawford continued her commitment to service members into the 1960s, by visiting army hospitals to cheer up soldiers who were injured in the Vietnam War.

Aside from volunteering to war efforts and service members, Crawford also volunteered for a great number of charity organizations, which included the American Red Cross, C.A.R.E., various charities for the advancement of care and cures for crippled children and the American Cancer Society, for which Crawford served as national chairwoman in 1972. From 1966 until 1973, Crawford appeared on the annual muscular dystrophy telethon to encourage the public to pledge funds to help those affected by the illness.

Crawford was elected as ball chairman of the 16th annual Animal Kingdom Ball on January 20, 1965, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. On March 25, 1971, Crawford accepted a position as honorary chairmanship of the board of advisers to help raise funds for the Negro Ensemble Company. Crawford also sent out the invitations for Alan King&#x27;s first charity benefit in support of children with mental disabilities.

Following her death, it was revealed that for many years Crawford had paid for hospital rooms and specialists for hundreds of indigent people who could not afford medical care—many of whom were members of the film industry who were down on their luck and destitute. Crawford never publicized these contributions, and did not want the public (or the patients) to know she was paying their medical bills.

==&quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;==

On October 2, 1978, Christina Crawford published a memoir titled &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;, alleging her late adoptive mother was emotionally and physically abusive. In 1981, the book was made into the film &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;, starring Faye Dunaway.
Crawford&#x27;s two other twin daughters, Cathy Crawford Lalonde and Cynthia Crawford Jordan, denounced the book, categorically denying any abuse. Cindy told reporters in 1979, &quot;I can&#x27;t understand how people believe this stupid stuff Tina has written.&quot; Cathy claimed in 1981 both the book and movie were &quot;untrue&quot;.

On May 28, 1981, Cathy appeared on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, claiming their mother was &quot;warm&quot; and Christina&#x27;s book was a &quot;great work of fiction&quot;.

On July 20, 1998, Cathy filed a lawsuit against Christina for &quot;defamation of character&quot;. Cathy stated in her lawsuit that during the 20th-anniversary book tour of &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;, Christina publicly claimed to interviewers that LaLonde and her twin sister, Cynthia, were not biological sisters, and that their adoption was never legal. LaLonde stated neither claim by Christina was true, and attached copies of the twin girls&#x27; birth certificates and adoption documentation to the lawsuit. The lawsuit was later settled out of court for $5,000 plus court costs. Later in 2008, Cathy told biographer Charlotte Chandler in 2008, &quot;I don&#x27;t know where [Christina] got her ideas. Our Mommie was the best mother anyone ever had.&quot;

Helen Hayes, June Allyson, and Vincent Sherman stated they had witnessed strict discipline. For example, Hayes and Sherman both stated in their autobiographies that they felt Joan was too strict a parent. Allyson stated in her autobiography that she witnessed Joan put Christina in &quot;time-out&quot;, and did not let her go to a friend&#x27;s birthday party as a punishment. However, these people never stated they witnessed any outright abuse. James MacArthur stated he spent a weekend with the Crawford family when he was a child and never saw any abuse, but did observe that Christopher was harnessed in his bed at night. Unbeknownst to MacArthur, according to Christopher&#x27;s daughter, Janet, Christopher was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Joan&#x27;s family doctor recommended the store-bought child harness to keep Christopher in bed at night and prevent him from wandering outside to play and possibly fall into the swimming pool. Christopher&#x27;s daughter stated to columnist Cindy Adams, &quot;I have two boys, one is identical to my brother and my father. We&#x27;re treating his hyperactivity with medication, but three generations have had this condition. It must come from something. Joan said she didn&#x27;t believe in heredity, but my dad proves her wrong. He, my brother, and my son all look alike and act alike.&quot;

Many of Crawford&#x27;s friends and co-workers, including Van Johnson, Ann Blyth, Katharine Hepburn, Cesar Romero, Gary Gray, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (Crawford&#x27;s first husband), denied the claims. In her 1987 autobiography, Myrna Loy stated, &quot;She [Christina] wanted to be Joan Crawford. I think that&#x27;s the basis of the book she wrote afterward and everything else. I saw what Christina&#x27;s mind created, the fantasy world she lived in.&quot;

Christina&#x27;s husband, producer Harvey Medlinsky, said in response to Christina&#x27;s memoir, &quot;I have only good things to say about Joan Crawford. She was always nice to me and Christina.&quot; &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; producer Gloria Monty, countered Christina&#x27;s allegation that Joan &quot;stole&quot; Christina&#x27;s role on the television show when she fell ill in 1968. According to Monty, Christina lied regarding this situation. Monty stated that she and CBS asked Joan to substitute for her daughter on the show, and that Joan agreed only in the interest of not allowing Christina to be permanently replaced by another actress until she could return to the show. Monty added, &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you that I saw Joan Crawford do everything she could to save that girl&#x27;s life and job.&quot;

Since the publication of &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; in 1978, Christina has attempted to capitalize on its monetary success with a one-woman show entitled &quot;Surviving Mommie Dearest&quot; in 2013, and in 2019, attempted to produce a musical version of her memoir, though it did not come to fruition.

==In popular culture==
Crawford was the initial inspiration for the Dragon Lady in comic strip Terry and the Pirates by Milton Caniff, debuting in 1934.

In 1937, Disney drew visual inspiration for the Evil Queen from Crawford, Queen Hash-a-Motep from She, Princess Kriemhild from Die Nibelungen, and actress Gale Sondergaard.

Pictures of Crawford were used in the album artwork of The Rolling Stones&#x27; album &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; (1972).

Four years after her death, Blue Öyster Cult released the song &quot;Joan Crawford&quot; as part of their album &quot;Fire of Unknown Origin&quot; (1981).

Crawford was portrayed by actress Barrie Youngfellow in the 1980 film &quot;The Scarlett O&#x27;Hara War&quot;.

The alleged feud between Crawford and Bette Davis is depicted in the 1989 book &quot;Bette and Joan: The Divine Feud&quot;. The Crawford-Davis rivalry was later the subject of the 2017 television series &quot;Feud: Bette and Joan&quot;, with Jessica Lange as Crawford and Susan Sarandon as Davis.

<text>Pentecost (also called Whit Sunday, Whitsunday or [[Whitsun]]) is a Christian holiday which takes place on the 49th day (50th day when inclusive counting is used) after Easter Day. It commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles of Jesus while they were in Jerusalem celebrating the Feast of Weeks, as described in the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 2:1–31). The Catholic Church believes the Holy Spirit descended upon Mary, the mother of Jesus, at the same time, as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 1:14).

Pentecost is one of the Great feasts in the Eastern Orthodox Church, a Solemnity in the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, a Festival in the Lutheran Churches, and a Principal Feast in the Anglican Communion. Many Christian denominations provide a special liturgy for this holy celebration. Since its date depends on the date of Easter, Pentecost is a &quot;moveable feast&quot;. The Monday after Pentecost is a legal holiday in many European, African and Caribbean countries.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;Pentecost&quot; comes from . One of the meanings of &quot;Pentecost&quot; in the Septuagint, the Koine translation of the Hebrew Bible, refers to the festival of Shavuot, one of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals, which is celebrated on the fiftieth day after Passover according to Deuteronomy 16:10, and Exodus 34:22, where it is referred to as the &quot;Festival of Weeks&quot; (). The Septuagint uses the term in this context in the Book of Tobit and 2 Maccabees.

The translators of the Septuagint also used the word in two other senses: to signify the year of Jubilee (Leviticus 25:10) an event which occurs every 50th year, and in several passages of chronology as an ordinal number. The term has also been used in the literature of Hellenistic Judaism by Philo of Alexandria and Josephus to refer to Shavuot.

== Background ==

In Judaism, Shavuot is a harvest festival that is celebrated seven weeks and one day after the first day of Passover in Deuteronomy 16:9, or seven weeks and one day after the Sabbath according to Leviticus 23:16. It is discussed in the Mishnah and the Babylonian Talmud, tractate Arakhin. The actual mention of fifty days comes from Leviticus 23:16.

The Festival of Weeks is also known as the Feast of Harvest in Exodus 23:16 and the Day of First Fruits in Numbers 28:26. In Exodus 34:22, it is called the &quot;first fruits of the wheat harvest.&quot;

Sometime during the Hellenistic period, the ancient harvest festival also became a day of renewing the Noahic covenant, described in Genesis 9:17, which is established between God and &quot;all flesh that is upon the earth&quot;. After the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE, offerings could no longer be brought to the Temple in Jerusalem and the focus of the festival shifted from agriculture to the Israelites receiving the Torah.

By this time, some Jews were already living in the Diaspora. According to there were Jews from &quot;every nation under heaven&quot; in Jerusalem, possibly visiting the city as pilgrims during Pentecost.

== New Testament ==
The narrative in Acts 2 of the Pentecost includes numerous references to earlier biblical narratives like the Tower of Babel, and the flood and creation narratives from the Book of Genesis. It also includes references to certain theophanies, with certain emphasis on God&#x27;s incarnate appearance on biblical Mount Sinai when the Ten Commandments were presented to Moses. Theologian Stephen Wilson has described the narrative as &quot;exceptionally obscure&quot; and various points of disagreement persist among bible scholars.

Some biblical commentators have sought to establish that the (&quot;house&quot;) given as the location of the events in Acts 2:2 was one of the thirty halls of the Temple where St. John&#x27;s school is now placed (called ), but the text itself is lacking in specific details. Richard C. H. Lenski and other scholars contend that the author of Acts could have chosen the word (sanctuary or temple) if this meaning were intended, rather than &quot;house&quot;. Some semantic details suggest that the &quot;house&quot; could be the &quot;upper room&quot; () mentioned in , but there is no literary evidence to confirm the location with certainty and it remains a subject of dispute amongst scholars.

The events of Acts Chapter 2 are set against the backdrop of the celebration of Pentecost in Jerusalem. There are several major features to the Pentecost narrative presented in the second chapter of the Acts of the Apostles. The author begins by noting that the disciples of Jesus &quot;were all together in one place&quot; on the &quot;day of Pentecost&quot; (). The verb used in Acts 2:1 to indicate the arrival of the day of Pentecost carries a connotation of fulfillment.

There is a &quot;mighty rushing wind&quot; (wind is a common symbol for the Holy Spirit) and &quot;tongues as of fire&quot; appear. The gathered disciples were &quot;filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance&quot;. Some scholars have interpreted the passage as a reference to the multitude of languages spoken by the gathered disciples, while others have taken the reference to &quot;tongues&quot; () to signify ecstatic speech.

In Christian tradition, this event represents fulfillment of the promise that Christ will baptize his followers with the Holy Spirit. Out of the four New Testament gospels, the distinction between baptism by water and the baptism by Christ with &quot;Holy Spirit and fire&quot; is only found in Matthew and Luke.

The narrative in Acts evokes the symbolism of Jesus&#x27;s baptism in the Jordan River, and the start of his ministry, by explicitly connecting the earlier prophecy of John the Baptist to the baptism of the disciples with the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. The timing of the narrative during the law giving festival of Pentecost symbolizes both continuity with the giving of the law, but also the central role of the Holy Spirit for the early church. The central role of Christ in Christian faith signified a fundamental theological separation from the traditional Jewish faith, which was grounded in the Torah and Mosaic Law.

Peter&#x27;s sermon in stresses the resurrection and exaltation. In his sermon, Peter quotes Joel 2:28–32 and Psalm 16 to indicate that first Pentecost marks the start of the Messianic Age. About one hundred and twenty followers of Christ (Acts 1:15) were present, including the Twelve Apostles (Matthias was Judas&#x27;s replacement) (Acts 1:13, 26), Jesus&#x27;s mother Mary, other female disciples and his brothers (). While those on whom the Spirit had descended were speaking in many languages, the Apostle Peter stood up with the eleven and proclaimed to the crowd that this event was the fulfillment of the prophecy.

In Acts 2:17, it reads: &quot;&#x27;And in the last days,&#x27; God says, &#x27;I will pour out my spirit upon every sort of flesh, and your sons and your daughters will prophesy and your young men will see visions and your old men will dream dreams.&quot; He also mentions (Acts 2:15) that it was the third hour of the day (about 9:00 am). Acts 2:41 then reports: &quot;Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.&quot;

Some critical scholars believe some features of the narrative are theological constructions. They believe that even if the Pentecost narrative is not literally true, it does signify an important event in the history of the early church which enabled the rapid spread of Christianity. Within a few decades important congregations had been established in all major cities of the Roman Empire.

Concerning Acts 2, Gerd Lüdemann considers the Pentecost gathering as very possible, and the apostolic instruction to be historically credible. Wedderburn acknowledges the possibility of a ‘mass ecstatic experience’, and notes it is difficult to explain why early Christians later adopted this Jewish festival if there had not been an original Pentecost event as described in Acts. He also holds the description of the early community in Acts 2 to be reliable.

Lüdemann views Acts 3:1–4:31 as historical. Wedderburn notes what he sees as features of an idealized description, but nevertheless cautions against dismissing the record as unhistorical. Hengel likewise insists that Luke described genuine historical events, even if he has idealized them.

Biblical commentator Richard C. H. Lenski has noted that the use of the term &quot;Pentecost&quot; in Acts is a reference to the Jewish festival. He writes that a well-defined, distinct Christian celebration did not exist until later years, when Christians kept the name of &quot;Pentecost&quot; but began to calculate the date of the feast based on Easter rather than Passover.

Peter stated that this event was the beginning of a continual outpouring that would be available to all believers from that point on, Jews and Gentiles alike.

== Liturgical celebration ==
=== Eastern churches ===
In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Pentecost is one of the Orthodox Great Feasts and is considered to be the highest ranking Great Feast of the Lord, second in rank only to Pascha (Easter). The service is celebrated with an All-night Vigil on the eve of the feast day, and the Divine Liturgy on the day of the feast itself. Orthodox churches are often decorated with greenery and flowers on this feast day, and the celebration is intentionally similar to the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which celebrates the giving of the Mosaic Law. In the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, Pentecost is one of the seven Major &quot;Lord&#x27;s Feasts&quot;.

The feast itself lasts three days. The first day is known as &quot;Trinity Sunday&quot;; the second day is known as &quot;Spirit Monday&quot; (or &quot;Monday of the Holy Spirit&quot;); and the third day, Tuesday, is called the &quot;Third Day of the Trinity.&quot; The Afterfeast of Pentecost lasts for one week, during which fasting is not permitted, even on Wednesday and Friday. In the Orthodox Tradition, the liturgical color used at Pentecost is green, and the clergy and faithful carry flowers and green branches in their hands during the services.

All of the remaining days of the ecclesiastical year, until the preparation for the next Great Lent, are named for the day after Pentecost on which they occur. This is again counted inclusively, such that the 15th day of Pentecost is 14 days after Trinity Sunday. The exception is that the Melkite Greek Catholic Church marks Sundays &quot;after Holy Cross&quot;.

The Orthodox icon of the feast depicts the Twelve Apostles seated in a semicircle (sometimes the Theotokos (Virgin Mary) is shown sitting in the center of them). At the top of the icon, the Holy Spirit, in the form of tongues of fire, is descending upon them. At the bottom is an allegorical figure, called &quot;Kosmos&quot;, which symbolizes the world. Although Kosmos is crowned with earthly glory he sits in the darkness caused by the ignorance of God. He is holding a towel on which have been placed 12 scrolls, representing the teaching of the Twelve Apostles.

==== Kneeling Prayer ====
An extraordinary service called the &quot;Kneeling Prayer&quot; is observed on the night of Pentecost. This is a Vespers service to which are added three sets of long poetical prayers, the composition of Basil the Great, during which everyone makes a full prostration, touching their foreheads to the floor (prostrations in church having been forbidden from the day of Pascha (Easter) up to this point). Uniquely, these prayers include a petition for all of those in hell, that they may be granted relief and even ultimate release from their confinement, if God deems this possible. In the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, it is observed at the time of ninth hour (3:00 pm) on the Sunday of Pentecost.

==== Apostles&#x27; Fast ====

The Second Monday after Pentecost is the beginning of the Apostles&#x27; Fast (which continues until the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul on June 29). Theologically, Orthodox do not consider Pentecost to be the &quot;birthday&quot; of the church; they see the church as having existed before the creation of the world (cf. &quot;The Shepherd of Hermas&quot;). In the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the &quot;Apostles Fast&quot; has a fixed end date on the fifth of the Coptic month of Epip (which currently falls on July 12, which is equivalent to June 29, due to the current 13-day Julian-Gregorian calendar offset). The fifth of Epip is the commemoration of the Martyrdom of St. Peter and Paul.

=== Western churches ===

The liturgical celebrations of Pentecost in Western churches are as rich and varied as those in the East. The typical image of Pentecost in the West is that of the Virgin Mary seated centrally and prominently among the disciples with flames resting on the crowns of their heads. Occasionally, parting clouds suggesting the action of the &quot;mighty wind&quot;; rays of light and the Dove are also depicted. the Western iconographic style is less static and stylized than that of the East, and other very different representations have been produced, and, in some cases, have achieved great fame such as the Pentecosts by Titian, Giotto, and el Greco.

St. Paul already in the 1st century notes the importance of this festival to the early Christian communities: see: and . Since the lifetime of some who may have been eyewitnesses, annual celebrations of the descent of the Holy Spirit have been observed.

In the Roman Catholic liturgy, Pentecost marks the end and completion of the Easter season, and the birth or &quot;great beginning&quot; of the church.

Before the Second Vatican Council Pentecost Monday as well was a Holy Day of Obligation during which the Catholic Church addressed the newly baptized and confirmed. Since the council, Pentecost Monday is no longer solemnized. Pentecost Monday remains an official festival in many Protestant churches, such as the (Lutheran) Church of Sweden, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, and others. In the Byzantine Catholic Rite Pentecost Monday is no longer a Holy Day of Obligation, but rather a simple holiday. In the Extraordinary Form of the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church, as at Easter, the liturgical rank of Monday and Tuesday of Pentecost week is a Double of the First Class and across many Western denominations, Pentecost is celebrated with an octave culminating on Trinity Sunday. However, in the modern Roman Rite (Ordinary Form), Pentecost ends after Evening Prayer on the feast day itself, with Ordinary Time resuming the next day.

Marking the festival&#x27;s importance, as the principal feast of the church and the fulfilment of Christ&#x27;s purpose in coming into the world, namely bringing the Holy Spirit which had departed with Adam and Eve&#x27;s fall, back into the world, all 33 following Sundays are &quot;Sundays after Pentecost&quot; in the Orthodox Church. In several denominations, such as the Lutheran, Episcopal, and United Methodist churches, and formerly in the Roman Catholic Church, all the Sundays from the holiday itself until Advent in late November or December are designated the 2nd, 3rd, etc. Sunday after Pentecost, again traditionally reckoned inclusively. Throughout the year, in Roman Catholic piety, Pentecost is the third of the Glorious Mysteries of the Holy Rosary, as well as being one of the Stations of the Resurrection or Via Lucis.

In some Evangelical and Pentecostal churches, where there is less emphasis on the liturgical year, Pentecost may still be one of the greatest celebrations in the year, such as in Germany or Romania. In other cases, Pentecost may be ignored as a holy day in these churches. In many evangelical churches in the United States, the secular holiday, Mother&#x27;s Day, may be more celebrated than the biblical feast of Pentecost. Some evangelicals and Pentecostals are observing the liturgical calendar and observe Pentecost as a day to teach the Gifts of the Holy Spirit.

Across denominational lines Pentecost has been an opportunity for Christians to honor the role of the Holy Spirit in their lives, and celebrate the birth of the Christian Church in an ecumenical context.

==== Red symbolism ====

The main sign of Pentecost in the West is the colour red. It symbolizes joy and the fire of the Holy Spirit.

Priests or ministers, and choirs wear red vestments, and in modern times, the custom has extended to the lay people of the congregation wearing red clothing in celebration as well. Red banners are often hung from walls or ceilings to symbolize the blowing of the &quot;mighty wind&quot; and the free movement of the Spirit.

In some cases, red fans, or red handkerchiefs, are distributed to the congregation to be waved during the procession, etc. Other congregations have incorporated the use of red balloons, signifying the &quot;Birthday of the Church&quot;. These may be borne by the congregants, decorate the sanctuary, or released all at once.

==== Flowers, fruits, and branches ====

The celebrations may depict symbols of the Holy Spirit, such as the dove or flames, symbols of the church such as Noah&#x27;s Ark and the Pomegranate, or especially within Protestant churches of Reformed and Evangelical traditions, words rather than images naming for example, the gifts and Fruits of the Spirit. Red flowers at the altar/preaching area, and red flowering plants such as geraniums around the church are also typical decorations for Pentecost masses/services.

These symbolize the renewal of life, the coming of the warmth of summer, and the growth of the church at and from the first Pentecost. In the southern hemisphere, for example, in southern Australia, Pentecost comes in the mellow autumntide, after the often great heat of summer, and the red leaves of the poinsettia have often been used to decorate churches then.

These flowers often play an important role in the ancestral rites, and other rites, of the particular congregation. For example, in both Protestant and Catholic churches, the plants brought in to decorate for the holiday may be each &quot;sponsored&quot; by individuals in memory of a particular loved one, or in honor of a living person on a significant occasion, such as their Confirmation day.

In German-speaking and other Central European countries, and also in overseas congregations originating from these countries through migration, green branches are also traditionally used to decorate churches for Pentecost. Birch is the tree most typically associated with this practice in Europe, but other species are employed in different climates.

==== Lowering of doves ====

In the Middle Ages, cathedrals and great churches throughout Western Europe were fitted with a peculiar architectural feature known as a Holy Ghost hole: a small circular opening in the roof that symbolized the entrance of the Holy Spirit into the midst of the congregation. At Pentecost, these Holy Ghost holes would be decorated with flowers, and sometimes a dove figure lowered through into the church while the narrative of Pentecost was read. Holy Ghost holes can still be seen today in European churches such as Canterbury Cathedral.

Similarly, a large two dimensional dove figure would be, and in some places still is, cut from wood, painted, and decorated with flowers, to be lowered over the congregation, particularly during the singing of the sequence hymn, or &quot;Veni Creator Spiritus&quot;. In other places, particularly Sicily and the Italian peninsula, rose petals were and are thrown from the galleries over the congregation, recalling the tongues of fire. (see below) In modern times, this practice has been revived, and adapted as well, to include the strewing of origami doves from above or suspending them, sometimes by the hundreds, from the ceiling.

==== Hymns and music ====
The singing of Pentecost hymns is also central to the celebration in the Western tradition. Hymns such as Martin Luther&#x27;s &quot;Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott&quot; (Come, Holy Spirit, God and Lord), Charles Wesley&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of Faith Come Down&quot; and &quot;Come Holy Ghost Our Hearts Inspire&quot; or Hildegard von Bingen&#x27;s &quot;O Holy Spirit Root of Life&quot; are popular. Some traditional hymns of Pentecost make reference not only to themes relating to the Holy Spirit or the church, but to folk customs connected to the holiday as well, such as the decorating with green branches. Other hymns include &quot;Oh that I had a Thousand Voices&quot; (&quot;&quot;O daß ich tausend Zungen hätte&quot;) by German, Johann Mentzer Verse 2: &quot;Ye forest leaves so green and tender, that dance for joy in summer air&quot; ...&quot; or &quot;O Day Full of Grace&quot; (&quot;&quot;Den signede Dag&quot;) by Dane, N. F. S. Grundtvig verse 3: &quot;Yea were every tree endowed with speech and every leaflet singing&quot; ...&quot;.

As Pentecost closes the Easter Season in the Roman Catholic Church, the dismissal with the double alleluia is sung at the end of Mass. The Paschal Candle is removed from the sanctuary at the end of the day.
In the Roman Catholic Church, Veni Sancte Spiritus is the sequence hymn for the Day of Pentecost. This has been translated into many languages and is sung in many denominations today. As an invocation of the Holy Spirit, Veni Creator Spiritus is sung during liturgical celebrations on the feast of Pentecost.

Trumpeters or brass ensembles are often specially contracted to accompany singing and provide special music at Pentecost services, recalling the Sound of the mighty wind. While this practice is common among a wide spectrum of Western denominations (Eastern Churches do not employ instrumental accompaniment in their worship) it is particularly typical, and distinctive to the heritage of the Moravian Church.

Another custom is reading the appointed Scripture lessons in multiple foreign languages recounting the speaking in tongues recorded in .

==== Fasting and devotions ====

For some Protestants, the nine days between Ascension Day, and Pentecost are set aside as a time of fasting and universal prayer in honour of the disciples&#x27; time of prayer and unity awaiting the Holy Spirit. Similarly among Roman Catholics, special Pentecost novenas are prayed. The Pentecost Novena is considered the first novena, all other novenas prayed in preparation of various feasts deriving their practice from those original nine days of prayer observed by the disciples of Christ.

While the Eve of Pentecost was traditionally a day of fasting for Catholics, contemporary canon law no longer requires it. Both Catholics and Protestants may hold spiritual retreats, prayer vigils, and litanies in the days leading up to Pentecost. In some cases vigils on the Eve of Pentecost may last all night. Pentecost is also one of the occasions specially appointed for the Lutheran Litany to be sung.

On the morning of Pentecost, a popular custom is &quot;to ascend hill tops and mountains during the early dawn of Whitsunday to pray. People call this observance &#x27;catching the Holy Ghost.&#x27; Thus they express in symbolic language the spiritual fact that only by means of prayer can the divine Dove be &#x27;caught&#x27; and the graces of the Holy Spirit obtained.&quot;

Another custom is for families to suspend &quot;artfully carved and painted wooden doves, representing the Holy Spirit&quot; over the dining tables as &quot;a constant reminder for members of the family to venerate the Holy Spirit.&quot; These are left hanging year-round and are cleaned before the feast of Pentecost, often being &quot;encased in a globe of glass&quot;.

On the vigil of Pentecost, a traditional custom is practiced, in which &quot;flowers, fields, and fruit trees&quot; are blessed.

==== Sacraments ====
From the early days of Western Christianity, Pentecost became one of the days set aside to celebrate Baptism. In Northern Europe Pentecost was preferred even over Easter for this rite, as the temperatures in late spring might be supposed to be more conducive to outdoor immersion as was then the practice. It is proposed that the term Whit Sunday derives from the custom of the newly baptized wearing white clothing, and from the white vestments worn by the clergy in English liturgical uses. The holiday was also one of the three days each year (along with Christmas and Easter) Roman Catholics were required to confess and receive Holy Communion in order to remain in good ecclesiastical standing.

Holy Communion is likewise often a feature of the Protestant observance of Pentecost as well. It is one of the relatively few Sundays some Reformed denominations may offer the communion meal, and is one of the days of the year specially appointed among Moravians for the celebration of their Love Feasts. Ordinations are celebrated across a wide array of Western denominations at Pentecost, or near to it. In some denominations, for example the Lutheran Church, even if an ordination or consecration of a deaconess is not celebrated on Pentecost, the liturgical color will invariably be red, and the theme of the service will be the Holy Spirit.

Above all, Pentecost is a day to hold Confirmation celebrations for youth. Flowers, the wearing of white robes or white dresses recalling Baptism, rites such as the laying on of hands, and vibrant singing play prominent roles on these joyous occasions, the blossoming of Spring forming an equal analogy with the blossoming of youth.

=== Rosalia ===

A popular tradition arose in both west and east of decorating the church with roses on Pentecost, leading to a popular designation of Pentecost as or &quot;Rose Feast&quot;; in Greek this became (). This led to &quot;Rusalii&quot; becoming the Romanian-language term for the feast, as well as the Neapolitan popular designation &quot;Pasca rusata&quot; (&quot;rosey Easter&quot;). In modern times, the term in Greek refers to the eve of Pentecost, not Pentecost itself; or, in the case of Megara in Attica, to the Monday and Tuesday after &quot;Pascha&quot;, as roses are often used during the whole liturgical season of the Pentecostarion, not just Pentecost. John Chrysostom warned his flock not to allow this custom to replace spiritually adorning themselves with virtue in reception of the Fruits of the Holy Spirit.

== Mariology ==
A secular iconography in both Western and Eastern Churches reflects the belief of the presence of the Blessed Virgin Mary on the day of Pentecost and her central role in the divine concession of the gift of the Holy Spirit to the Apostles.
 confirms the presence of the Mother of Jesus with the Twelve in a spiritual communion of daily prayer. It is the unique reference to the Mother of God after Jesus&#x27;s entrusting to John the Apostle during the Crucifixion.

According to that iconographic tradition, the Latin encyclical &quot;Mystici Corporis Christi&quot; officially stated: 

The Catholic and the Orthodox Churches accord the Mother of God a special form of veneration called &quot;hyperdulia&quot;. It corresponds to the special power of intercessory prayers dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary over those of all saints. Popes have stated that Mary prayed to God and her intercession was capable to persuade God to send the Holy Spirit as a permanent gift to the Twelve and their successors, thus forming the Apostolic Church.

In a similar way, Pope John Paul II, in the general audience held in Vatican on May 28, 1997, affirmed:

The Marian intercessory prayer is dated to the day before Pentecost; while it is not explicitly stated that she was with the Apostles, it is in consideration of the fact she was called “full of grace” by the Archangel Gabriel at the Annunciation.

Mary&#x27;s special relationship with the Holy Spirit and her presence at Pentecost gave way to one of her devotional titles being “Mother of the Church”. In 2018 Pope Francis designated the Monday after Pentecost each year as the feast of Mary, Mother of the Church.

== Music ==
Several hymns were written and composed for Pentecost, the earliest in use today being &quot;Veni Creator Spiritus&quot; in (Come, Creator Spirit), attributed to the 9th-century Rabanus Maurus, and translated throughout the centuries in different languages.

This one and some more are suitable also for other occasions imploring the Holy Spirit, such as ordinations and coronations, as well as the beginning of school years.

=== Classical compositions ===

The Lutheran church of the Baroque observed three days of Pentecost. Some composers wrote sacred cantatas to be performed in the church services of these days. Johann Sebastian Bach composed several cantatas for Pentecost, including &quot;Erschallet, ihr Lieder, erklinget, ihr Saiten!&quot; BWV 172, in 1714 and &quot;Also hat Gott die Welt geliebt&quot;, BWV 68, in 1725. Gottfried Heinrich Stölzel wrote cantatas such as &quot;Werdet voll Geistes&quot; (Get full of spirit) in 1737. Mozart composed an antiphon &quot;Veni Sancte Spiritus&quot; in 1768.

Gustav Mahler composed a setting of Maurus&#x27; hymn &quot;Veni, Creator Spiritus&quot; as the first part of his Symphony No. 8, premiered in 1910.

Olivier Messiaen composed an organ mass &quot;Messe de la Pentecôte&quot; in 1949/50. In 1964 Fritz Werner wrote an oratorio for Pentecost &quot;Veni, sancte spiritus&quot; (Come, Holy Spirit) on the sequence &quot;Veni Sancte Spiritus&quot;, and Jani Christou wrote &quot;Tongues of Fire&quot;, a Pentecost oratorio. Richard Hillert wrote a &quot;Motet for the Day of Pentecost&quot; for choir, vibraphone, and prepared electronic tape in 1969. Violeta Dinescu composed &quot;Pfingstoratorium&quot;, an oratorio for Pentecost for five soloists, mixed chorus and small orchestra in 1993. Daniel Elder&#x27;s 21st century piece, &quot;Factus est Repente&quot;, for a cappella choir, was premiered in 2013.

== Regional customs and traditions ==
In Italy it was customary to scatter rose petals from the ceiling of the churches to recall the miracle of the fiery tongues; hence in Sicily and elsewhere in Italy, the feast is called &quot;Pasqua rosatum&quot;. The Italian name &quot;Pasqua rossa&quot; comes from the red colours of the vestments used on Whitsunday.

In France it was customary to blow trumpets during Mass, to recall the sound of the mighty wind which accompanied the Descent of the Holy Spirit.

In the northwest of England, church and chapel parades called Whit Walks take place at Whitsun (sometimes on Whit Friday, the Friday after Whitsun). Typically, the parades contain brass bands and choirs; girls attending are dressed in white. Traditionally, Whit Fairs (sometimes called Whitsun Ales) took place. Other customs such as morris dancing and cheese rolling are also associated with Whitsun.

In Hungary the day (called Pünkösd in Hungarian) is surrounded by many unique rites, which probably have their origins in ancient Hungarian customs. The girls dressed in festive costumes choose a Little Queen (Kiskirályné not to be confused with the Pünkösdi Királyné), who is raised high. Then a figure dressed as an animal appears and dies, and is brought back to life by his attendant chanting a joke incantation.

In Finland there is a saying known virtually by everyone which translates as &quot;if one has no sweetheart until Pentecost, he/she will not have it during the whole summer.&quot;

In Port Vila, the capital of Vanuatu, people originating from Pentecost Island usually celebrate their island&#x27;s name-day with a special church service followed by cultural events such as dancing.

In Ukraine the springtime feast day of &quot;Zeleni Sviata&quot; became associated with the Pentecost. (The exact origin of the relationship is not known). The customs for the festival were performed in the following order: first, home and hearth would be cleaned; second, foods were prepared for the festival; finally, homes and churches were decorated with wildflowers and various types of green herbs and plants. A seven course meal may have been served as the Pentecost feast which may have included traditional dishes such as cereal with honey (&quot;kolyvo&quot;), rice or millet grains with milk, sauerkraut soup (&quot;kapusniak&quot;), chicken broth with handmade noodles (&quot;yushka z zaterkoiu&quot;), cheese turnovers (&quot;pyrizhky z syrom&quot;), roast pork, buckwheat pancakes served with eggs and cheese (&quot;mlyntsi&quot;), and baked kasha.

== Date and public holiday ==

The earliest possible date is May 10 (as in 1818 and 2285). The latest possible date is June 13 (as in 1943 and 2038). The day of Pentecost is seven weeks after Easter Sunday: that is to say, the fiftieth day after Easter inclusive of Easter Sunday. Pentecost may also refer to the 50 days from Easter to Pentecost Sunday inclusive of both. Because Easter itself has no fixed date, this makes Pentecost a moveable feast. In the United Kingdom, traditionally the next day, Whit Monday, was until 1970 a public holiday. Since 1971, by statute, the last Monday in May has been a Bank Holiday.

While Eastern Christianity treats Pentecost as the last day of Easter in its liturgies, in the Roman liturgy it is usually a separate feast. The fifty days from Easter Sunday to Pentecost Sunday may also be called Eastertide.

Since Pentecost itself is on a Sunday, it is automatically considered to be a public holiday in countries with large Christian denominations. However, in Hungary, it is distinguished from a regular Sunday due to the stricter trading laws, forcing most businesses to close on even if they are normally open on Sundays (the same restrictions apply to the following Monday).

Pentecost Monday is a public holiday in many countries including Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Benin, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania (since 2008), Senegal, (most parts of) Switzerland, Togo and Ukraine. It is also a public holiday in Catalonia, where it is known as &quot;la Segona Pasqua&quot; (Second Easter).

In Sweden it was also a public holiday, but Pentecost Monday (Annandag Pingst) was replaced by Swedish National Day on June 6, by a government decision on December 15, 2004. In Italy and Malta, it is no longer a public holiday. It was a public holiday in Ireland until 1973, when it was replaced by Early Summer Holiday on the first Monday in June. In the United Kingdom the day is known as Whit Monday, and was a bank holiday until 1967 when it was replaced by the Spring Bank Holiday on the last Monday in May. In France, following reactions to the implementation of the &quot;Journée de solidarité envers les personnes âgées&quot;, Pentecost Monday has been reestablished as a regular (not as a &quot;working&quot;) holiday on May 3, 2005.

== Literary allusions ==
According to legend, King Arthur always gathered all his knights at the round table for a feast and a quest on Pentecost:

So ever the king had a custom that at the feast of Pentecost in especial, afore other feasts in the year, he would not go that day to meat until he had heard or seen of a great marvel.

German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe declared Pentecost &quot;das liebliche Fest&quot; – the lovely Feast, in a selection by the same name in his &quot;Reineke Fuchs&quot;.

:Pfingsten, das liebliche Fest, war gekommen;
:es grünten und blühten Feld und Wald;
:auf Hügeln und Höhn, in Büschen und Hecken
:Übten ein fröhliches Lied die neuermunterten Vögel;
:Jede Wiese sprosste von Blumen in duftenden Gründen,
:Festlich heiter glänzte der Himmel und farbig die Erde.

&quot;Pfingsten, das liebliche Fest&quot;, speaks of Pentecost as a time of greening and blooming in fields, woods, hills, mountains, bushes and hedges, of birds singing new songs, meadows sprouting fragrant flowers, and of festive sunshine gleaming from the skies and coloring the earth – iconic lines idealizing the Pentecost holidays in the German-speaking lands.

Further, Goethe records an old peasant proverb relating to Pentecost in his &quot;Sankt-Rochus-Fest zu Bingen&quot;
– &quot;Ripe strawberries at Pentecost mean a good wine crop.&quot;

Alexandre Dumas, père mentions of Pentecost in &quot;Twenty Years After&quot; (French: Vingt ans après), the sequel to &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. A meal is planned for the holiday, to which La Ramée, second in command of the prison, is invited, and by which contrivance, the Duke is able to escape. He speaks sarcastically of the festival to his jailor, foreshadowing his escape : &quot;Now, what has Pentecost to do with me? Do you fear, say, that the Holy Ghost may come down in the form of fiery tongues and open the gates of my prison?&quot;

William Shakespeare mentions Pentecost in a line from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; Act 1, Scene V. At the ball at his home, Capulet speaks in refuting an overestimate of the time elapsed since he last danced: &quot;What, man? &#x27;Tis not so much, &#x27;tis not so much! &#x27;Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio, Come Pentecost as quickly as it will, Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask&#x27;d.&quot; Note here the allusion to the tradition of mumming, Morris dancing and wedding celebrations at Pentecost.

&quot;The Whitsun Weddings&quot; is one of Philip Larkin&#x27;s most famous poems, describing a train journey made through England on a Whitsun weekend.

<text>Whatì (; from the Dogrib language meaning &quot;Marten Lakes&quot;), officially the &quot;Tłı̨chǫ Community Government of Whatì&quot; is a First Nations community in the North Slave Region of the Northwest Territories, Canada. Whatì is located by Lac La Martre, about northwest of the territorial capital of Yellowknife.

==History==
With rich and varied wildlife, the area has long been a favoured hunting ground of the Tłı̨chǫ (Dogrib Dene) Indigenous people. The North West Company established a trading post there in 1793, and many natives began settling there permanently, while they continued to hunt and fish in the area. With the establishment of a trading post at Fort Rae on Great Slave Lake in the late 19th century, most regional trading was accomplished at the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and free traders posts there. A trading post at Lac La Martre was not again established until the 1920s.

On January 1, 1996, the community officially changed its name from Lac La Martre to the Tłı̨chǫ name &quot;Wha Ti&quot;, meaning &quot;Marten Lake,&quot; the same meaning as the French and then on August 4, 2005 to the current spelling. Other traditional Tłı̨chǫ names for the settlement include Tsoti (&#x27;fouled water lake&#x27;) and Mine Go Kola (&#x27;net fishing with houses&#x27;).

Before 2005, the community was unincorporated, and local governance was provided by a First Nations band government, Wha Ti First Nation. Under the terms of the Tłı̨chǫ Agreement, most responsibilities of Wha Ti have been transferred to a new Whatì Community Government. However, the First Nation is still recognized by the federal government for Indian Act enrollment.

==Demographics==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Whatì had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The majority of the population is Indigenous of which 445 were First Nations and 10 were Métis. The main languages were Dogrib and English with a few North Slavey speakers.

==Economy==
While trapping, hunting, and fishing continue to be the main economic activities in this traditional community, efforts have been made to develop tourism as well. A fishing lodge was opened, and many tourists come to see the abundant wildlife, including black bears, barren-ground caribou, wolves, and eagles. The community takes special pride in the fact that no alcohol is allowed there.

Whatì is part of the Tlicho Government.

==Infrastructure==
===Transport===
Whatì Airport connects the community by air to the territorial capital Yellowknife.

Whatì is connected to the territorial road network by the Tłı̨chǫ Highway (Northwest Territories Highway 9), an all-season gravel road running from the community to the Yellowknife Highway (Northwest Territories Highway 3). The only road access to Whatì prior to the Tłı̨chǫ Highway opening in 2021 was via winter road.

===Communications===
Telephone service was introduced to Whati in 1982.

== Climate ==
Whatì has a subarctic climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Ecld&quot;) with mild to warm summers and long cold winters.

<doc id="45976" wikidata="Q39392" url="?curid=45976" title="Compromise of 1850">
<text>The Compromise of 1850 was a package of five separate bills passed by the United States Congress in September 1850 that temporarily defused tensions between slave and free states in the years leading up to the American Civil War. Designed by Whig senator Henry Clay and Democratic senator Stephen A. Douglas, with the support of President Millard Fillmore, the compromise centered on how to handle slavery in recently acquired territories from the Mexican–American War (1846–48).

The provisions of the compromise were:
* approved California&#x27;s request to enter the Union as a free state
* strengthened fugitive slave laws with the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850
* banned the slave trade in Washington, D.C. (while still allowing slavery itself there)
* defined northern and western borders for Texas while establishing a territorial government for the Territory of New Mexico, with no restrictions on whether any future state from this territory would be free or slave
* established a territorial government for the Territory of Utah, with no restrictions on whether any future state from this territory would be free or slave

A debate over slavery in the territories erupted during the Mexican–American War, as many Southerners sought to expand slavery to the newly acquired lands and many Northerners opposed any such expansion. The debate was further complicated by Texas&#x27;s claim to all former Mexican territory north and east of the Rio Grande, including areas it had never effectively controlled. These issues prevented the passage of organic acts to create organized territorial governments for the land acquired in the Mexican–American War. In early 1850, Clay proposed a package of eight bills that would settle most of the pressing issues before Congress. Clay&#x27;s proposal was opposed by President Zachary Taylor, anti-slavery Whigs like William Seward, and pro-slavery Democrats like John C. Calhoun, and congressional debate over the territories continued. The debates over the bill are among the most famous in Congressional history, and the divisions devolved into fistfights and drawn guns on the floor of Congress.

After Taylor died and was succeeded by Fillmore, Douglas took the lead in passing Clay&#x27;s compromise through Congress as five separate bills. Under the compromise, Texas surrendered its claims to present-day New Mexico and other states in return for federal assumption of Texas&#x27;s public debt. California was admitted as a free state, while the remaining portions of the Mexican Cession were organized into New Mexico Territory and Utah Territory. Under the concept of popular sovereignty, the people of each territory would decide whether or not slavery would be permitted. The compromise also included a more stringent Fugitive Slave Law and banned the slave trade in Washington, D.C. The issue of slavery in the territories would be re-opened by the Kansas–Nebraska Act (1854), but the Compromise of 1850 played a major role in postponing the American Civil War.

The Republic of Texas declared its independence from Mexico following the Texas Revolution of 1836, and, partly because Texas had been settled by a large number of Americans, there was a strong sentiment in both Texas and the United States for the annexation of Texas by the United States. In December 1845, President James K. Polk signed a resolution annexing Texas, and Texas became the 28th state in the union. Polk, an expansionist and slave owner, sought further expansion through the acquisition of the Mexican province of Alta California, which represented new lands to settle as well as a potential gateway to trade in Asia. His administration attempted to purchase California from Mexico, but the annexation of Texas stoked tensions between Mexico and the United States. Relations between the two countries were further complicated by Texas&#x27;s claim to all land north of the Rio Grande; Mexico argued that the more northern Nueces River was the proper Texan border.

In March 1846, a skirmish broke out on the northern side of the Rio Grande, ending in the death or capture of dozens of American soldiers. Shortly thereafter, the United States declared war on Mexico, beginning the Mexican–American War. In August 1846, Polk asked Congress for an appropriation that he hoped to use as a down payment for the purchase of California in a treaty with Mexico, igniting a debate over the status of future territories. A freshman Democratic Representative, David Wilmot of Pennsylvania, offered an amendment known as the Wilmot Proviso that would ban slavery in any newly acquired lands. The Wilmot Proviso was defeated in the Senate, but it injected the slavery debate into national politics.

In September 1847, an American army under General Winfield Scott captured the Mexican capital in the Battle for Mexico City. Several months later, Mexican and American negotiators agreed to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, under which Mexico agreed to recognize the Rio Grande as Texas&#x27;s southern border and to cede Alta California and New Mexico. The Missouri Compromise had settled the issue of the geographic reach of slavery within the Louisiana Purchase territories by prohibiting slavery in states north of 36°30′ latitude, and Polk sought to extend this line into the newly acquired territory. However, the divisive issue of slavery blocked any such legislation. As his term came to a close, Polk signed the lone territorial bill passed by Congress, which established the Territory of Oregon and banned slavery in it. Polk declined to seek re-election in the 1848 presidential election, and the 1848 election was won by the Whig ticket of Zachary Taylor and Millard Fillmore.

Prophetically, Ralph Waldo Emerson quipped that &quot;Mexico will poison us&quot;, referring to the ensuing divisions around whether the newly conquered lands would be slave or free. As of the 1848 election of Taylor, the issue was not yet apparent. Taylor was both a Whig and a slaveholder; though Whigs were increasingly anti-slavery, Taylor&#x27;s slaveholding had reassured the South, and he won handily. Taylor made a key electoral promise that he would not veto any congressional resolution on slavery. Much to the horror of Southerners, however, Taylor indicated that true to his promise, he would not even veto the Wilmot Proviso if it were passed. Tensions accelerated quickly into the fall of 1849. Midterm elections worsened matters, as the Free Soil Party had gained 12 seats, which gave them a king-maker position in the closely divided House: 105 Whigs to 112 Democrats. After three weeks and 62 ballots, the House could not elect a speaker; the main issue was slavery in the new territories. The tumult of that period was severe, with a loaded revolver drawn on the floor of Congress, several fistfights between Northerners and Southerners, and then Senator Jefferson Davis challenging an Illinois representative to a duel. Southern representatives increasingly bandied around the idea of secession. Finally, the House adopted a resolution that allowed a speaker to be elected with a plurality, and elected Howell Cobb on the 63rd ballot. As James McPherson puts it: &quot;It was an inauspicious start to the 1850&#x27;s.&quot;

==Issues==
Three major types of issues were addressed by the Compromise of 1850: a variety of boundary issues, the status of territory issues, and the issue of slavery. While capable of analytical distinction, the boundary and territory issues were included in the overarching issue of slavery. Pro-slavery and anti-slavery interests were each concerned with both the amount of land on which slavery was permitted and with the number of States in the slave or free camps. Since Texas was a slave state, not only the residents of that state but also both camps on a national scale had an interest in the size of Texas.

===Texas===
The independent Republic of Texas won the decisive Battle of San Jacinto (April 21, 1836) against Mexico and captured Mexican president Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. He signed the Treaties of Velasco, which recognized the Rio Grande as the boundary of the Republic of Texas. The treaties were then repudiated by the government of Mexico, which insisted that Mexico remained sovereign over Texas since Santa Anna had signed the treaty under coercion, and promised to reclaim the lost territories. To the extent that there was a &quot;de facto&quot; recognition, Mexico treated the Nueces River as its northern boundary control. A vast, largely unsettled area lay between the two rivers. Neither Mexico nor the Republic of Texas had the military strength to assert its territorial claim. On December 29, 1845, the Republic of Texas was annexed to the United States and became the 28th state. To facilitate US annexation, Sam Houston played a ploy on the American government by flirting with the British. The British believed that they could make the state abolish slavery by purchasing it. However, Southern leaders, alarmed by the threat of British emancipation of Texan slaves, pushed harder for annexation. Eventually, John Tyler, in hopes of appealing to southern Democrats, led the push for annexation with Abel Upshur. Texas was staunchly committed to slavery, with its constitution making it illegal for the legislature to free slaves.

The United States inherited the Texas-Mexican boundary dispute after annexing Texas, which quickly led to the Mexican-American War. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the war, defined the new Mexico–United States border, which followed the Rio Grande in part, but made no specific reference the claims of the Republic of Texas. The southwestern part of the ceded territory was referred to as the Mexican Cession; but the boundaries between this Cession and the State of Texas were unclear, and Texas continued to claim all the territory north and east of the Rio Grande, which included a large stretch of land that it had never effectively controlled in present-day eastern New Mexico. New Mexico had long prohibited slavery, a fact that affected the debate over its territorial status, but many New Mexican leaders opposed joining Texas primarily because Texas&#x27;s capital lay hundreds of miles away and because Texas and New Mexico had a history of conflict dating back to the 1841 Santa Fe Expedition. Outside of Texas, many Southern leaders supported Texas&#x27;s claims to New Mexico to secure as much territory as possible for the expansion of slavery.

Another issue that would affect the compromise was Texas&#x27;s debt; it had approximately $10 million in debt left over from its time as an independent nation, and that debt would become a factor in the debates over the territories.

===California===

California was part of the Mexican Cession. After the Mexican War, California was essentially run by military governors. President James K. Polk tried to get Congress to establish a territorial government in California officially, but the increasingly sectional debates prevented that. The South wanted to extend slave territory to Southern California and to the Pacific Coast, but the North did not. The issue of whether it would be free or slave might well have gone undecided for years, as it had already after the end of the Mexican American war, if not for the finding of natural riches.

Near the end of Polk&#x27;s term in 1848, incredible news reached Washington: gold had been discovered in California. So began the California Gold Rush, which transformed California from a sleepy and almost forgotten land into a burgeoning hub with a population bigger than Delaware or Florida. The mostly lawless land found itself in desperate need of governance. Californians wanted to be made into a territory or state promptly. In response to growing demand for a better more representative government, a Constitutional Convention was held in 1849. The delegates unanimously outlawed slavery. They had no interest in extending the Missouri Compromise Line through California and splitting the state; the lightly populated southern half never had slavery and was heavily Hispanic. The issue of California would play a central role in the exhausting 1849 speaker dispute.

===Other issues===
Aside from the disposition of the territories, other issues had risen to prominence during the Taylor years. The Washington, D.C. slave trade angered many in the North, who viewed the presence of slavery in the capital as a blemish on the nation. Disputes around fugitive slaves had grown since 1830 in part due to improving means of transportation, as the enslaved used roads, railroads, and ships to escape. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 had granted jurisdiction to all state and federal judges over cases regarding fugitive slaves, but several Northern states, dissatisfied by the lack of due process in these cases, had passed personal liberty laws that made it more difficult to return alleged fugitive slaves to the South. Congress also faced the issue of Utah, which like California and New Mexico, had been ceded by Mexico. Utah was inhabited largely by Latter-day Saints whose then-practice of polygamy was unpopular elsewhere in the United States.

==Passage==
===Taylor takes office===
When Taylor took office, the issue of slavery in the Mexican Cession remained unresolved. While a Southern slaveowner himself, Taylor believed that slavery was economically infeasible in the Mexican Cession, and as such he opposed slavery in those territories as a needless source of controversy. In Taylor&#x27;s view, the best way forward was to admit California as a state rather than a federal territory, as it would leave the slavery question out of Congress&#x27;s hands. The timing for statehood was in Taylor&#x27;s favor, as the Gold Rush was well underway at the time of his inauguration, and California&#x27;s population was exploding. In October 1849, a California constitutional convention unanimously agreed to join the Union—and to ban slavery within their borders. In his December 1849 State of the Union report, Taylor endorsed California&#x27;s and New Mexico&#x27;s applications for statehood, and recommended that Congress approve them as written and &quot;should abstain from the introduction of those exciting topics of a sectional character&quot;.

=== Main figures ===
The problem of what to do with the territories became the leading issue in Congress. So began the most famous debates in the history of Congress. At the head were the three titans of Congress: Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John C. Calhoun. All had been born during the American Revolution, and had carried the torch of the Founding Fathers. This represented their last and greatest act in politics. The nationalist Clay and Webster sought compromise, while Southern sectionalist Calhoun warned of imminent disaster. The triumvirate would be broken before long as Calhoun would die of tuberculosis. In March, shortly before his death, his final speech was delivered by his friend the Virginia Senator James M. Mason, as the blanket-wrapped Calhoun sat nearby, too weak to do it himself. He provided a prescient warning that the South perceived the balance between North and South as broken, and that any further imbalance might lead to war. The situation was severe.

Other players included a variety of rising politicians who would play key roles in the Civil War, such as the staunch anti-slavery William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase, who would be in Lincoln&#x27;s cabinet; the future president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis; and rival to Abraham Lincoln, Stephen A. Douglas.

===Clay proposes compromise===

On January 29, 1850, Senator Henry Clay introduced a plan which combined the major subjects under discussion. His legislative package of eight bills included the admission of California as a free state, the cession by Texas of some of its northern and western territorial claims in return for debt relief, the establishment of New Mexico and Utah territories, a ban on the importation of slaves into the District of Columbia for sale, and a more stringent fugitive slave law. Clay had originally favored voting on each of his proposals separately, but Senator Henry S. Foote of Mississippi convinced him to combine the proposals regarding California&#x27;s admission and the disposition of Texas&#x27;s borders into one bill. Clay hoped that this combination of measures would convince House members from both North and South to support the overall package of laws even if they objected to specific provisions. Clay&#x27;s proposal attracted the support of some Northern Democrats and Southern Whigs, but it lacked the backing necessary to win passage, and debate over the bill continued. Seven months of agonizing politicking lay ahead.

===Opposition===
President Taylor opposed the compromise and continued to call for immediate statehood for both California and New Mexico. Senator Calhoun and some other Southern leaders argued that the compromise was biased against the South because it would lead to the creation of new free states. Most Northern Whigs, led by William Henry Seward, who delivered his famous &quot;Higher Law&quot; speech during the controversy, opposed the Compromise as well because it would apply the Wilmot Proviso to the western territories and because of the pressing of ordinary citizens into duty on slave-hunting patrols. That provision was inserted by Democratic Virginia Senator James M. Mason to entice border-state Whigs, who faced the greatest danger of losing slaves as fugitives but were lukewarm on general sectional issues related to the South on Texas&#x27;s land claims.

===Debate and results===
On April 17, a &quot;Committee of Thirteen&quot; agreed on the border of Texas as part of Clay&#x27;s plan. The dimensions were later changed. That same day, during debates on the measures in the Senate, Vice President Fillmore and Senator Benton verbally sparred, with Fillmore charging that the Missourian was &quot;out of order.&quot; During the heated debates, Compromise floor leader Henry S. Foote of Mississippi drew a pistol on Benton.

In early June, nine slave-holding Southern states sent delegates to the Nashville Convention to determine their course of action if the compromise passed. While some delegates preached secession, the moderates ruled and proposed a series of compromises, including extending the dividing line designated by the Missouri Compromise of 1820 to the Pacific Coast.

Taylor died in July 1850, and was succeeded by Vice President Fillmore, who had privately come to support Clay&#x27;s proposal. The various bills were initially combined into one &quot;omnibus&quot; bill. Despite Clay&#x27;s efforts, it failed in a crucial vote on July 31, opposed by southern Democrats and by northern Whigs. He announced on the Senate floor the next day that he intended to pass each part of the bill. The 73-year-old Clay, however, was physically exhausted as the effects of tuberculosis, which would eventually kill him, began to take their toll. Clay left the Senate to recuperate in Newport, Rhode Island, and Senator Stephen A. Douglas took the lead in attempting to pass Clay&#x27;s proposals through the Senate.

Fillmore, anxious to find a quick solution to the conflict in Texas over the border with New Mexico, which threatened to become an armed conflict between Texas militia and the federal soldiers, reversed the administration&#x27;s position late in July and threw its support to the compromise measures. At the same time, Fillmore denied Texas&#x27;s claims to New Mexico, asserting that the United States had promised to protect the territorial integrity of New Mexico in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Fillmore&#x27;s forceful response helped convince Texas&#x27;s U.S. Senators, Sam Houston and Thomas Jefferson Rusk, to support Stephen Douglas&#x27;s compromise. With their support, a Senate bill providing for a final settlement of Texas&#x27;s borders won passage days after Fillmore delivered his message. Under the terms of the bill, the U.S. would assume Texas&#x27;s debts, while Texas&#x27;s northern border was set at the 36° 30&#x27; parallel north (the Missouri Compromise line) and much of its western border followed the 103rd meridian. The bill attracted the support of a bipartisan coalition of Whigs and Democrats from both sections, though most opposition to the bill came from the South. The Senate quickly moved on to the other major issues, passing bills that provided for the admission of California, the organization of New Mexico Territory, and the establishment of a new fugitive slave law.

The debate then moved to the House of Representatives, where Fillmore, Senator Daniel Webster, Douglas, Representative Linn Boyd, and Speaker of the House Howell Cobb took the lead in convincing members to support the compromise bills that had been passed in the Senate. The Senate&#x27;s proposed settlement of the Texas-New Mexico boundary faced intense opposition from many Southerners, as well as from some Northerners who believed that Texas did not deserve monetary compensation. After a series of close votes that nearly delayed consideration of the issue, the House voted to approve a Texas bill similar to that which had been passed by the Senate. Following that vote, the House and the Senate quickly agreed on each of the major issues, including the banning of the slave trade in Washington. The president quickly signed each bill into law save for the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850; he ultimately signed that law as well after Attorney General Crittenden assured him that the law was constitutional. Though some in Texas still favored sending a military expedition into New Mexico, in November 1850 the state legislature voted to accept the compromise.

==Provisions==
The general solution that was adopted by the Compromise of 1850 was to transfer a considerable part of the territory claimed by Texas state to the federal government; to organize two new territories formally, the Territory of New Mexico and the Territory of Utah, which expressly would be allowed to locally determine whether they would become slave or free territories, to add another free state to the Union (California), to adopt a severe measure to recover slaves who had escaped to a free state or free territory (the Fugitive Slave Law); and to abolish the slave trade in the District of Columbia. A key provision of each of the laws respectively organizing the Territory of New Mexico and the Territory of Utah was that slavery would be decided by local option, called popular sovereignty. That was an important repudiation of the idea behind the failure to prohibit slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico. However, the admission of California as a free state meant that Southerners were giving up their goal of a coast-to-coast belt of slave states.

===Settlement of borders===

Texas was allowed to keep the following portions of the disputed land: south of the 32nd parallel and south of the 36°30&#x27; parallel north and east of the 103rd meridian west. The rest of the disputed land was transferred to the United States. The final border was designed to keep the frontier settlement of El Paso in Texas, since despite that settlement&#x27;s geographic, historic, and economic ties to New Mexico, Texas had recently established a county government in El Paso and thus successfully claimed it as an integral part of Texas. A similar attempt to keep Santa Fe in Texas failed, and Santa Fe became part of the New Mexico territory. The United States Constitution (Article IV, Section 3) does not permit Congress unilaterally to reduce the territory of any state, so the first part of the Compromise of 1850 had to take the form of an offer to the Texas State Legislature, rather than a unilateral enactment. This ratified the bargain and, in due course, the transfer of a broad swath of land from the state of Texas to the federal government was accomplished. In return for Texas&#x27;s giving up this land, the United States assumed the debts of Texas.

From the Mexican Cession, the New Mexico Territory received most of the present-day state of Arizona, most of the western part of the present-day state of New Mexico, and the southern tip of present-day Nevada (south of the 37th parallel). The territory also received most of present-day eastern New Mexico, a portion of present-day Colorado (east of the crest of the Rocky Mountains, west of the 103rd meridian, and south of the 38th parallel); all of this land had been claimed by Texas.

From the Mexican Cession, the Utah Territory received present-day Utah, most of present-day Nevada (everything north of the 37th parallel), a major part of present-day Colorado (everything west of the crest of the Rocky Mountains), and a small part of present-day Wyoming. That included the newly founded colony at Salt Lake, of Brigham Young. The Utah Territory also received some land that had been claimed by Texas; this land is now part of present-day Colorado that is east of the crest of the Rocky Mountains.

===Fugitive Slave Act===

Perhaps the most important part of the Compromise received the least attention during debates. Enacted September 18, 1850, it is informally known as the Fugitive Slave Law, or the Fugitive Slave Act. It bolstered the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793. The new version of the Fugitive Slave Law now required federal judicial officials in all states and federal territories, including free states, to assist with the return of escaped slaves to their masters in slave states. Any federal marshal or other official who did not arrest an alleged runaway slave was liable to a fine of $1,000 (). Law enforcement everywhere in the US now had a duty to arrest anyone suspected of being a fugitive slave on no more evidence than a claimant&#x27;s sworn testimony of ownership. Suspected slaves could neither ask for a jury trial nor testify on their own behalf. Also, aiding a runaway slave by providing food or shelter was now a crime nationwide, punished by six months&#x27; imprisonment and a $1,000 fine. Officers capturing a fugitive slave were entitled to a fee for their work, and this expense was to be paid by the Federal Government.

The law was so completely pro-slavery as to prohibit the admission of the testimony of a person accused of being an escaped slave into evidence at the judicial hearing to determine the status of the accused escaped slave. Thus, if free Blacks were claimed to be escaped slaves, they could not resist their return to slavery (or enslavement for the first time) by truthfully telling their actual history. Furthermore, the federal commissioners overseeing the hearings were paid $5 for ruling that a person was free, but were paid $10 for determining that he or she was a slave, thus providing a financial incentive to rule in favor of slavery regardless of the evidence. The law further exacerbated the problem of free Blacks being kidnapped and sold as slaves.

The Fugitive Slave Act was essential to meet Southern demands. In terms of public opinion in the North, the critical provision was that ordinary citizens were required to aid slave catchers and that it was a crime to assist a fugitive. Many Northerners deeply resented these provisions. The violent process of returning slaves to the South made the act abhorrent to many Northerners. Resentment towards the Act further heightened tensions between the North and South, which were then inflamed further by abolitionists such as Harriet Beecher Stowe. Her novel, &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, stressed the horrors of recapturing escaped slaves and outraged Southerners.

===End of slave trade in District of Columbia===
A statute enacted as part of the compromise prohibited the slave trade in Washington, D.C., but not slave ownership. Southerners in Congress, alarmed and outraged, were unanimous in opposing the provision, seen as a concession to the abolitionists and a bad precedent, but they were outvoted. However, Washington&#x27;s residents could still easily buy and sell slaves in the nearby states of Virginia and Maryland.

==Implications==
Passage of the Compromise of 1850, as it came to be known, caused celebration in Washington and elsewhere, with crowds shouting, &quot;The Union is saved!&quot; Fillmore himself described the Compromise of 1850 as a &quot;final settlement&quot; of sectional issues, though the future of slavery in New Mexico and Utah remained unclear. The admission of new states, or the organization of territories in the remaining unorganized portion of the Louisiana Purchase, could also potentially reopen the polarizing debate over slavery.

Not all accepted the Compromise of 1850. Longing for the former national influence of the South, a South Carolina newspaper wrote, &quot;the Rubicon is passed ... and the Southern States are now vassals in this Confederacy.&quot; (This was not referring to the then-future Confederate States of America; many still considered the United States a confederacy at the time.) Many Northerners, meanwhile, were displeased by the Fugitive Slave Act. The debate over slavery in the territories would be re-opened in 1854 through the Kansas–Nebraska Act. It continued throughout the late 1850s, which culminated in one of the more well-known debates over slavery, the Lincoln-Douglas debates.

In hindsight, the Compromise merely postponed the American Civil War for a decade, contrary to the expectations of many at the time, who felt the issue of slavery had finally been settled. During that decade, the Whig Party completely broke down, to be replaced with the new Republican Party dominant in the North, while Democrats reigned in the South.

Others argue that the Compromise only made more obvious the pre-existing sectional divisions, and laid the groundwork for future conflict. They view the Fugitive Slave Law as helping to polarize the US, as shown in the enormous reaction to Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. The passage of the Fugitive Slave Law aroused feelings of bitterness in the North. Furthermore, the Compromise of 1850 led to a breakdown in the spirit of compromise in the Antebellum period. The Compromise exemplifies that spirit, but the deaths of influential senators who worked on the compromise, primarily Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, contributed to the feeling of increasing disparity between the North and South.

The delay of hostilities for ten years allowed the Northern states to continue to industrialize. The Southern states, largely based on slave labor and cash crop production, lacked the ability to industrialize heavily.

According to historian Mark Stegmaier, &quot;The Fugitive Slave Act, the abolition of the slave trade in the District of Columbia, the admission of California as a free state, and even the application of the formula of popular sovereignty to the territories were all less important than the least remembered component of the Compromise of 1850—the statute by which Texas relinquished its claims to much of New Mexico in return for federal assumption of the debts.&quot;

==Other proposals==

Proposals in 1846 to 1850 on the division of the Southwest included the following (some of which are not mutually exclusive):
* The Wilmot Proviso banning slavery in any new territory to be acquired from Mexico, not including Texas, which had been annexed the previous year. It passed the House in August 1846 and February 1847 but not the Senate. Later, an effort failed to attach the proviso to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.
* The Extension of the Missouri Compromise line was proposed by failed amendments to the Wilmot Proviso by William W. Wick and then Stephen Douglas to extend the Missouri Compromise line (36°30&#x27; parallel north) west to the Pacific (south of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California) to allow the possibility of slavery in most of present-day New Mexico and Arizona, and southern California. That line was again proposed by the Nashville Convention of June 1850.
* Popular sovereignty, developed by Lewis Cass and Stephen Douglas as the position of the Democratic Party, was to let the (white male) residents of each territory decide by vote whether to allow slavery. It was implemented in the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854, giving rise to the violence of the &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; period. 
* William L. Yancey&#x27;s &quot;Alabama Platform&quot;, endorsed by the Alabama and the Georgia legislatures and by Democratic state conventions in Florida and Virginia, called for no restrictions on slavery in the territories by the federal government or territorial governments before statehood, opposition to any candidates supporting either the Wilmot Proviso or popular sovereignty, and federal legislation to overrule Mexican anti-slavery laws.
* Two free states were proposed by Zachary Taylor, who served as president from March 1849 to July 1850. As President, he proposed that the entire area become two free states, called California and New Mexico but much larger than the ones today. None of the area would be left as an unorganized or organized territory, which would avoid the question of slavery in the territories.
* Changing Texas&#x27;s borders was proposed by Senator Thomas Hart Benton in December 1849 or January 1850. Texas&#x27;s western and northern boundaries would be the 102nd meridian west and the 34th parallel north.
* Two southern states were proposed by Senator John Bell, with the assent of Texas, in February 1850. New Mexico would get all Texas land north of the 34th parallel north, including today&#x27;s Texas Panhandle, while the area to the south, including the southeastern part of today&#x27;s New Mexico, would be divided at the Colorado River of Texas into two Southern states, balancing the admission of California and New Mexico as free states.
* The first draft of the compromise of 1850 had Texas&#x27;s northwestern boundary be a straight, diagonal line from the Rio Grande 20 miles north of El Paso to the Red River (Mississippi watershed) at the 100th meridian west, the southwestern corner of today&#x27;s Oklahoma.

<text>Victoria Caroline Beckham (; born 17 April 1974) is an English fashion designer, singer, and television personality. She rose to prominence in the 1990s as a member of the pop group the Spice Girls, in which she was nicknamed Posh Spice. With over 100 million records sold worldwide, the group became the best-selling female group of all time. After the Spice Girls disbanded in 2001, Beckham signed with Virgin Records, to release her self-titled debut solo album, which produced two UK Top 10 singles. Beckham has also become an internationally recognised style icon and fashion designer.

Beckham has starred in five official documentaries and reality shows, including &quot;Victoria&#x27;s Secrets&quot; (2000), &quot;Being Victoria Beckham&quot; (2002), &quot;The Real Beckhams&quot; (2003), &quot;Victoria Beckham – A Mile in Their Shoes&quot; (2004), and &quot;Victoria Beckham: Coming to America&quot; (2007). She is married to former association football player David Beckham, and they have four children, including Brooklyn and Romeo. As of May 2019, the couple&#x27;s joint wealth is estimated at £355 million. 

Following high-profile collaborations with other brands, Beckham launched an eponymous label in 2008, and a lower-priced (diffusion) label in 2011. The Victoria Beckham label was named designer brand of the year in the UK in 2011; in 2012 the brand was assessed as the star performer in the Beckham family&#x27;s business interests. Writing in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2011, Belinda White noted that the transition from WAG to fashion designer had been more successful than most had predicted, saying: &quot;She has gathered a significant celebrity following and won over the scathing fashion pack who now clamour for a ticket to her bi-annual show at New York Fashion Week.&quot; Beckham was appointed an OBE in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to the fashion industry.

==Early life==
Beckham was born Victoria Caroline Adams on 17 April 1974 at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex, England, and raised in Goffs Oak, Hertfordshire. She is the eldest of three children of Jacqueline Doreen (née Cannon), a former insurance clerk and hairdresser, and Anthony William Adams, who worked as an electronics engineer, and drove a Rolls-Royce, something she would later dispute. They founded an electronics wholesale business which allowed a comfortable upbringing for Victoria, her sister, Louise, and her brother, Christian Adams. Beckham&#x27;s great-great-great-grandfather was German artist and revolutionary Carl Heinrich Pfänder and her great-great-great-granduncle was Minnesota politician William Pfaender.

After watching the musical film &quot;Fame&quot; in 1980, she decided to pursue a musical career. Jacqueline and Anthony Adams enrolled her at Jason Theatre School. In 1991, Beckham entered Laine Theatre Arts in Epsom, Surrey and studied dance and modelling. Beckham attended St. Mary&#x27;s High School in Cheshunt, where she was embarrassed by her family&#x27;s wealth and often begged her father not to drop her off outside the school in their Rolls-Royce. Eventually, she became a member of a band called Persuasion.

== Music career ==

===1994–2000: Spice Girls===

Beckham auditioned for a March 1994 advertisement in &quot;The Stage&quot; which required girls who were &quot;street smart, extrovert[ed], ambitious and able to sing and dance&quot;. In 1994, Beckham joined the all-female group, the Spice Girls. In the recordings before her marriage, she is credited with her maiden name as Victoria Adams. The group&#x27;s first single was called &quot;Wannabe&quot; (1996), and she worked alongside Geri Halliwell, Emma Bunton, Mel B and Melanie C. It went to number one in the United Kingdom and United States, and another 35 countries. It was followed by eight further number one singles from their albums &quot;Spice&quot;, &quot;Spiceworld&quot; and &quot;Forever&quot;. Each member of the group received a nickname from the media and Beckham was named &quot;Posh Spice&quot;. The group is the best-selling female group of all time, selling over 80 million records worldwide. After the release of their third album, &quot;Forever&quot;, which charted at number two in the UK but was far less successful than their previous two albums, the Spice Girls stopped recording, concentrating on their solo careers in regards to their foreseeable future.

===2000–2002: &quot;Victoria Beckham&quot;===
On 14 August 2000, Beckham released her first solo single, &quot;Out of Your Mind&quot; in collaboration with Dane Bowers and Truesteppers. The week of release coincided with the release of &quot;Groovejet (If This Ain&#x27;t Love)&quot; by Spiller featuring Sophie Ellis-Bextor, resulting in a chart battle dubbed &#x27;Posh vs. Posher&#x27; by the tabloids. Before the single&#x27;s release, on 8 July 2000, Beckham made her public solo debut at London&#x27;s Hyde Park at a concert to raise money for the Prince&#x27;s Trust charity. She sang &quot;Out of Your Mind&quot; to a 100,000-strong audience. Beckham then signed a recording contract with her group label Virgin Records. Her next single as a solo artist, &quot;Not Such An Innocent Girl&quot;, was released on 17 September 2001. Again, she faced competition in another hugely hyped chart battle, this time with Kylie Minogue&#x27;s single &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;. Despite a huge promotional campaign, Beckham was outsold eight to one, and her single debuted at number 6. Beckham&#x27;s eponymous debut album, which was released on 1 October 2001, reached Number 10 in the UK album chart. The album cost a reputed £5 million to produce and it sold a modest 50,000 copies.

The second and final single to be released from the album was &quot;A Mind of Its Own&quot; on 11 February 2002. The single reached number 6 in the UK and sold 56,500 copies. Rumours soon spread that Beckham was to be dropped by her label for not charting in the Top Three. These were strongly denied at the time. Beckham commented &quot;You know what newspapers are like, they just like to put all the negative stuff in, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned and the record company is concerned it is all great.&quot; A third single, &quot;I Wish&quot;, was promoted but never materialised. The single version was a remix featuring Robbie Craig, and was performed on TV on &quot;Friday Night&#x27;s All Wright&quot;. Following the announcement of Beckham&#x27;s second pregnancy, the single was shelved. Beckham was reportedly dropped by Virgin Records along with fellow Spice Girls Emma Bunton and Melanie B, but a statement from her publicist denied reports, stating: &quot;No-one has been dropped. The Virgin deal has come to a natural end and both parties have decided not to continue.&quot;

===2002–2004: Unreleased albums and final solo releases===
In 2002, Beckham signed a contract with Telstar Records and 19 Management worth £1.5 million. In 2002, she began recording an electropop-influenced album, tentatively titled &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;. However, desiring a more urban sound, she began working with producer Damon Dash the following year on R&amp;B and hip hop influenced tracks for an album tentatively titled &quot;Come Together.&quot; The Dash-produced track &quot;It&#x27;s That Simple&quot; featuring M.O.P. premiered on radio stations in July 2003 as a promotional single, generating mixed reviews. Beckham&#x27;s first single with Telstar, the double A-side &quot;Let Your Head Go&quot; / &quot;This Groove&quot;, was released in the UK on 29 December 2003, utilizing one song from both projects: &quot;Let Your Head Go&quot; from &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; and &quot;This Groove&quot; from &quot;Come Together.&quot; The release received heavy promotion and many TV appearances across the Christmas period and charted at number three in the UK. Outside of the UK, Simon Fuller reportedly had planned to market Beckham’s music in the US. In April 2004, Telstar announced bankruptcy and both albums were cancelled, while Beckham, disappointed with wasted time in studio, gave up music to focus on her fashion career. The albums were never released, but have since leaked online in their entirety.

===2007–2012: Return of the Spice Girls===

In 2007, the Spice Girls reformed and announced plans to embark upon a reunion tour, from which they were said to have earned £10 million each (approximately $20 million). Beckham had previously stated that she and her former Spice colleagues were enjoying their solo careers in various fields, saying &quot;We&#x27;re all still doing our own thing.&quot; Their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album was released in early-November 2007 and the tour began on 2 December 2007. At its advent, Beckham said &quot;I wanted my children to see that Mummy was a pop star. It was the last opportunity for them to stand in a crowd full of people screaming for the Spice Girls.&quot; When Beckham had her hair coloured brown for the tour, she stated that her sons immediately reacted by saying &quot;Oh my goodness, it&#x27;s Posh Spice. She&#x27;s back.&quot;

Film-maker Bob Smeaton directed an official film of the tour titled &quot;Spice Girls: Giving You Everything&quot;, which was first aired on Fox8 in Australia. It later aired in the UK, on 31 December 2007 on BBC One. As well as their sell-out tour, the Spice Girls were contracted to appear in Tesco advertisements, for which they were paid £1 million each.

In October 2009, reports suggested that the Spice Girls were to star in a reality show in which they would cast female actors to play their roles in a musical. The following year, Judy Craymer teamed up with the Spice Girls and Simon Fuller to start developing a Spice Girls musical titled &quot;Viva Forever!&quot;. On 26 June 2012, all five Spice Girls were in attendance at a press conference in London to promote the launch of &quot;Viva Forever!&quot; The musical opened at the West End&#x27;s Piccadilly Theatre on 11 December 2012. On 12 August 2012, after much speculation, Beckham and the Spice Girls performed a medley of &quot;Wannabe&quot; and &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony, reuniting solely for the event. Their performance was the most tweeted moment of Olympics closing ceremony with over 116,000 tweets on Twitter per minute.

The band reunited again for a 2019 tour, however Beckham opted not to participate in the reunion choosing to focus on her fashion label instead. When the American television presenter Ellen DeGeneres asked her why she chose not to join with the other Spice Girls for the reunion tour, she said &quot;It just didn&#x27;t feel like the right thing to do. [But] I&#x27;ll always be Posh Spice, always.&quot;

== Fashion ==

Beckham made a guest appearance on the catwalk for Maria Grachvogel on 17 February 2000, marking her debut as a model at London Fashion Week. Beckham also acted as a British ambassador for Dolce and Gabbana and was briefly the face of Rocawear in 2003. Beckham designed a limited-edition fashion line for Rock &amp; Republic called VB Rocks in 2004, consisting mainly of jeans for the high end of the market, retailing at approximately $300 in the US.

On 16 January 2006, Beckham walked the runway for Roberto Cavalli at Milan Fashion Week, and was for a period exclusively dressed by him for red-carpet and social events. For the March 2006 issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, Beckham acted as fashion editor when she styled her close friend, Katie Holmes, for a fashion shoot. She has admitted to a personal love of sunglasses, saying &quot;I&#x27;m quite obsessed with sunglasses. I collect vintage Guccis and Carreras – they can make virtually any outfit look cool.&quot; After Beckham&#x27;s departure from Rock &amp; Republic, in September 2006, she furthered her fashion ventures by launching her own denim label, dvb Style. Beckham then launched a new official website, dvbstyle.com to promote her fashion work.

On 14 June 2007, Beckham launched dvb Denim collection in New York at Saks Fifth Avenue, along with unveiling her eyewear range in the United States for the first time. In the same month, Beckham made her first appearance at London&#x27;s annual Graduate Fashion Week as a judge alongside Glenda Bailey (editor-in-chief of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;) and Lanvin&#x27;s Alber Elbaz, to choose the winner of the River Island Gold Award, worth £20,000. In August 2007, Intimately Beckham perfume was launched into US stores, one of more than 20 perfumes she and David Beckham have introduced over the years. In September 2007 her cosmetics line V-Sculpt was launched in Tokyo. In a 2007 appearance at an LA Galaxy press conference, Beckham is credited with having popularised Roland Mouret&#x27;s &#x27;moon dress&#x27; and his brand, and Beckham was also the face of Marc Jacobs for his Spring 2008 collection.

The fashion magazine covers Beckham has appeared on during her career include &quot;I-D&quot; in 2004 and &quot;W&quot; in 2007. Her first &quot;Vogue&quot; appearance was the April 2008 British edition. This was followed by &quot;Vogue India&quot;, &quot;Vogue Paris&quot; as well as the German, Russian, Australian, Turkish, Taiwanese, Chinese and Spanish editions. Beckham has also graced various international editions of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; and &quot;Elle&quot;. On 17 July 2018, Victoria&#x27;s collection of her Reebok collaboration was launched.

===Launch of fashion label===
Beckham&#x27;s eponymous label was launched in September 2008. By 2011, it had grown into a fixture of New York Fashion Week and a lower-priced Victoria by Victoria Beckham label was introduced. In the first quarter of 2011–12, it was predicted to generate annual sales of more than £60 million. Known initially for its dresses, the range has expanded into separates and luxury handbags selling at up to £18,000. Alongside the main fashion line and diffusion range, the Victoria Beckham brand still includes separate denim, eyewear and fragrance lines. In November 2011, Victoria Beckham won Designer Brand of the Year at the British Fashion Awards.

In September 2012, Victoria Beckham was the most talked about designer on Twitter during New York Fashion Week, also acquiring 57,000 new followers during the shows according to research by The Whispr Group. Writing in &quot;The Independent&quot; in February 2014, Alexander Fury described how Victoria Beckham had made the transition from novelty to respected designer, citing her recent guest editorship of French &quot;Vogue&quot; and forthcoming participation in a panel discussion with the dean of Parsons design school in New York. The article concluded that the brand&#x27;s sales were down to the appeal of the designs themselves, not the celebrity association.

In 2017, Beckham&#x27;s new collection for Target featured a wide range of sizes from XS to 3X for women. Beckham also introduced a new line for children&#x27;s wear. In 2018, the collection was presented at London Fashion Week instead of at New York Fashion Week as normal. In 2019, a spokesperson for the brand confirmed that the line would remain fur-free, and announced that as of the autumn/winter collection, it would also be free of any exotic skins.

=== Business difficulties ===
Despite her high social profile, her fashion brand has not been a business success. In 2018 the label was losing £4,000 a day. In November 2019, the BBC reported that &quot;Victoria Beckham&#x27;s fashion business has posted another annual loss as demand for the former Spice Girl&#x27;s high end clothes &quot;plateaued&quot;. Victoria Beckham Limited, which has not made a profit since it launched in 2008, reported a loss of £12.3m for 2018. Sales slipped 16% to £35m, amid weaker wholesale demand. Chairman Ralph Toledano said sales of clothing and accessories had levelled off after years of growth. &quot;The performance was in line with expectations, so we were not surprised. Our goal is to reach profitability as soon as possible,&quot; he told trade journal Business of Fashion. &quot;Mrs Beckham launched her label in 2008 with a collection of luxury dresses, and now sells fashion and accessories in more than 400 stores around the world.&quot; 
 In 2022, Beckham&#x27;s fashion label was £54 million in debt.

=== Victoria Beckham Beauty ===
In September 2019, Beckham launched the beauty brand &quot;Victoria Beckham Beauty&quot;. Together with co-founder Sarah Creal, she showcased the brand at London Fashion Week. Secondary packaging of the makeup is made from 100% post-consumer waste, while shipping materials are either recyclable or biodegradable. Beckham has described it as &quot;active and effective, but clean and kind&quot;. The brand&#x27;s first line of products was eye makeup, and included eye liner, individual eye shadows, and an eye shadow palette. A line of lip products, comprising a lip tint and waterproof lip pencils, was released the following month.

==Television==

Beckham has shot five official documentaries. The first, dated 11 January 2000, was called &quot;Victoria&#x27;s Secrets&quot;, a programme only shown in the UK on Channel 4. It involved Beckham being followed by cameras while also discussing and interviewing other British celebrities, such as Elton John.
The second, &quot;Being Victoria Beckham&quot;, was broadcast in March 2002 and saw Beckham discussing her career as a solo artist with the release of her first album, and also showed her at various photo shoots and recording sessions. The documentary attracted a strong audience of 8.83 million, coming top in its timeslot. One critic described her as &quot;so clearly level-headed, happy with her not inconsiderable lot and seemingly unfazed by the madly intrusive nature of her monumentally ridiculous fame&quot;. The third, &quot;The Real Beckhams&quot;, aired on 24 December 2003 on ITV1 and focused on the Beckhams&#x27; move to Madrid from London after David Beckham was signed to Real Madrid. In those years, she suffered a jealousy attack and had a fight in a gym with Ana Obregón because her husband David and Ana had been sending phone messages. It also featured Victoria Beckham re-launching her solo career and showed her mocking the tabloid stories she reads in the paper every day. The special received an audience of 6.10 million viewers and was later released on DVD on 2 February 2004.

The fourth was titled &quot;Full Length &amp; Fabulous: The Beckhams&#x27; 2006 World Cup Party&quot;, and followed Victoria and David Beckham organising and making preparations to host a 2006 World Cup Party at a marquee in the grounds of their mansion in Hertfordshire, which aimed to raise money for their charity. Two tickets to attend the ball were auctioned on-line for charity, and sold for £103,000. The documentary aired on 28 May 2006 and showed the event itself, where the menu was designed, especially by friend and chef Gordon Ramsay, and the charity auction was hosted by Graham Norton. Ramsay catered for 600 guests, with the aid of 40 chefs and 100 waiting staff. The ITV documentary attracted an average of 7.56 million viewers.

To document Victoria Beckham&#x27;s preparations for her family&#x27;s move to the US, she signed a deal with NBC for six episodes of a half-hour unscripted reality TV series. Despite original plans for six episodes, the show was cut to a one-hour special only as there &quot;just wasn&#x27;t enough (material) for a series.&quot; The show, called &quot;Victoria Beckham: Coming to America&quot;, aired on 16 July 2007 in the US and Canada. It was heavily scrutinised by the American media and critics, with the &quot;New York Post&quot; describing it as &quot;an orgy of self-indulgence&quot; and also describing Beckham as &quot;vapid and condescending&quot;. The programme was the third-most-watched programme in its time-slot and received viewing figures of 4.9 million in the US, beaten by a repeat of &quot;Wife Swap&quot; and two sitcoms. The programme aired in Britain on 17 July 2007 on ITV with 3.84 million viewers tuning in. The programme was produced by Simon Fuller who managed her and the Spice Girls on their come-back tour.

In July 2007, it was announced that Beckham would shortly begin filming a cameo appearance as herself in an episode of the second season of ABC&#x27;s TV series &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;. The episode, &quot;A Nice Day for a Posh Wedding&quot;, aired on 9 November 2007 in the United States and on 23 November in the United Kingdom. Despite her forays into television, Beckham has denied plans to embark upon a Hollywood movie career. In February 2008, it was revealed that Beckham would be the guest judge for the finale of fourth season of &quot;Project Runway&quot;, which aired on 5 March 2008 in the US.

It was reported in October 2007 that Beckham had turned down the opportunity to appear in &quot;Sex and the City: The Movie&quot;. She stated in an interview: &quot;[I was] asked to be in the &quot;Sex and the City&quot; film, which I would have loved to have done, but because I am in full-on Spice Girls rehearsal mode, unfortunately, I can&#x27;t do it.&quot; In 2010, Beckham voiced Queen Amphitrite in an episode of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. She said it was thrilling to get the invitation, as her children were fans of the show.

==Books==
On 13 September 2001, Beckham released her first book, &quot;Learning to Fly&quot;. The title was taken from a line in a song from the musical &quot;Fame&quot;, which Beckham had enjoyed as a child. The verse that inspired the title was: &quot;I&#x27;m gonna live forever, I&#x27;m gonna learn how to fly&quot;. The autobiography documents her childhood, time during the Spice Girls, her marriage and family life, as well as her career at the time. 

&quot;Learning to Fly&quot; became the third best-selling non-fiction title of 2001 and the total UK sales stand at more than 500,000 copies. When the book was first released, it went to Number 1 in the book charts after four weeks of release, relegating Robbie Williams&#x27; book to second place. A high-profile guest appearance on &quot;Parkinson&quot;, watched by nine million people, helped to promote the book. &quot;Hello!&quot;, &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; joined to buy the rights to preview and serialise the book before its publication. The figure paid was thought to be near £1 million.

Beckham was quoted by a Spanish journalist in 2005 as saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve never read a book in my life&quot;. She later explained this was a mistranslation from the original Spanish in which the interview was printed, saying she actually stated that she never had time to finish reading a book because she was always too busy looking after her children.

Beckham&#x27;s second book, a fashion advice guide titled &quot;That Extra Half an Inch: Hair, Heels and Everything in Between&quot;, was published on 27 October 2006. &quot;That Extra Half an Inch: Hair, Heels and Everything in Between&quot; includes tips from Beckham on fashion, style and beauty, and also contains photography by Mario Testino, Annie Leibovitz and Steven Meisel. The book became another best-seller, and has sold 400,000 copies in Britain alone since it was published in hardcover. The rights have since been sold to the United States, the Netherlands, Japan, Portugal, Lithuania, Russia, and, most recently, China.

==Power and influence==

In 2007, Beckham was the 52nd richest woman in Britain and the 19th richest person in Britain along with her husband David, with an estimated joint wealth of £112 million ($225 million). According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Beckham Ventures, a company linked to the Victoria Beckham fashion business, was the best performing brand in the family&#x27;s three businesses in 2012, coming close to matching turnover in a sister company that promotes the David Beckham brand.

In 2010, Beckhams&#x27;s charity work with Save the Children was nominated for the Do Something With Style Award, an awards show, produced by VH1. She is an International Goodwill Ambassador for UNAIDS and a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation. Beckham promotes faux/synthetic furs. Her stand against the fur industry generated praise from animal rights organizations, including PETA; Beckham has stated that she is &quot;supportive of its [PETA&#x27;s] high-profile anti-fur campaigns&quot;, and pledged &quot;never to work with fur in any of her own fashion collections&quot;. In February 2013, she was assessed as one of the 100 most powerful women in the UK in the fashion category by &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; on BBC Radio 4. In 2014, Beckham joined the Ban Bossy campaign as a spokesperson advocating leadership roles for girls.

Beckham was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to the fashion industry. She stated she was &quot;delighted and humbled for the recognition,&quot; which her husband also received in 2003. However, as recipients of honours are sworn to secrecy, and Beckham had announced her honour before the 2017 New Year Honours&#x27; official publication, she was criticised for the &quot;betrayal of etiquette&quot; by the Conservative MP Peter Bone.

==Personal life==

Beckham was engaged to electrician Mark Wood with whom she was in a relationship from 1988 to 1994. She then had a relationship with Canadian actor Corey Haim in 1995, which ended on mutual terms. She collects handbags, and owns over 100 Birkin bags, made by Hermès, including a £100,000 pink one. The full collection is estimated to be worth more than £1.5 million.

===Marriage and children===

In early 1997 she started dating footballer David Beckham, after they met at a charity football match; prior to this he had watched her music videos and commented to teammates that he was attracted to her, but had been overcome with shyness when they were first introduced. A few months earlier, Victoria had also expressed a wish to meet David during a Spice Girls football photo session (by chance, she wore the kit of his club Manchester United for the feature as the group&#x27;s manager was a supporter). Of their initial meeting, she said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t really know who he was. I was never into football.&quot; Initially, they kept their relationship out of the public eye. The couple announced their engagement in 1998 and were dubbed &quot;Posh and Becks&quot; by the media.

On 4 July 1999, Victoria and David were married by the Bishop of Cork, Paul Colton, at Luttrellstown Castle, Ireland. The wedding attracted much media coverage. Beckham&#x27;s teammate, Gary Neville, was the best man, and the couple&#x27;s four-month-old son Brooklyn was the ring bearer. Most of the media were kept away from the ceremony as an exclusive deal with &quot;OK!&quot; magazine had been arranged, but photographs were released showing the Beckhams sitting on golden thrones. Victoria wore a diamond coronet created for her by jewellery designer Slim Barrett. A total of 437 staff were employed for the wedding reception, which was estimated to have cost £500,000 (US$823,650).

The couple bought what became their most famous home for £2.5 million in 1999; the property, which is set in of land, was given a £3 million renovation and was subsequently dubbed Beckingham Palace by the media. They sold the property in 2014. Victoria and David have four children: sons Brooklyn (born 1999), Romeo (born 2002) and Cruz (born 2005), and daughter, Harper (born 2011). Elton John and David Furnish are reportedly the godparents of Brooklyn and Romeo Beckham and their godmother is Elizabeth Hurley. Two children were baptized Catholic at Holy Trinity, Chipping Norton; among their godparents were Eva Longoria and Marc Anthony.

===Alleged kidnap and death threats===
In January 2000, a tip-off to Scotland Yard detectives exposed a plot to kidnap Victoria and Brooklyn Beckham and hold them at a house in Hampstead, London. The family was then moved to a secret location, but no arrests were made. In March of that year, she received a death threat prior to performing at the Brit Awards with the Spice Girls, and at the show&#x27;s rehearsal, a red laser light appeared on her chest and she was rushed off stage. After a fire door was found to be lodged open, it was thought that there had been an assassin there, and Beckham later revealed that she was terrified by the experience. In November 2002, five people were arrested after another plot for her kidnap was infiltrated by a tabloid newspaper. All charges were dropped after a witness was deemed unreliable.

<text>George Michael (born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou; 25 June 1963 – 25 December 2016) was an English singer-songwriter and record producer. Regarded as a pop culture icon, he was known as a creative force in songwriting, vocal performance, and visual presentation.

Born in East Finchley, Middlesex, Michael rose to fame after forming the pop duo Wham! with Andrew Ridgeley in 1981. He took part in Band Aid&#x27;s UK number-one single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; in 1984 and performed at the following year&#x27;s Live Aid concert. His debut studio album, &quot;Faith&quot; (1987), won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and became one of the best-selling albums of all time, having sold over 25 million copies worldwide. Michael then went on to release a series of multimillion-selling albums, including &quot;Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1&quot; (1990), &quot;Older&quot; (1996), &quot;Ladies &amp; Gentlemen: The Best of George Michael&quot; (1998), &quot;Songs from the Last Century&quot; (1999), &quot;Patience&quot; (2004), and &quot;Twenty Five&quot; (2006). His most successful singles include &quot;Careless Whisper&quot;, &quot;A Different Corner&quot;, &quot;I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)&quot;, &quot;Faith&quot;, &quot;Father Figure&quot;, &quot;One More Try&quot;, &quot;Monkey&quot;, &quot;Praying for Time&quot;, &quot;Freedom! &#x27;90&quot;, &quot;Jesus to a Child&quot;, &quot;Fastlove&quot;, &quot;Outside&quot;, &quot;Amazing&quot;, and &quot;An Easier Affair&quot;.

Michael came out as gay in 1998, and was an active LGBT rights campaigner and HIV/AIDS charity fundraiser. His personal life, drug use, and legal troubles made headlines following an arrest for public lewdness in 1998 and multiple drug-related offences. The 2005 documentary &quot;A Different Story&quot; covered his career and personal life. His 25 Live tour spanned three tours from 2006 to 2008. In 2011 Michael fell into a coma during a bout with pneumonia, but recovered. He performed his final concert at London&#x27;s Earls Court in 2012. Michael died of heart disease on Christmas Day in 2016, at his home in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.

Michael is one of the best-selling recording artists of all time, scoring 10 number-one songs on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and 13 number-one songs on the UK singles chart. He won numerous music awards, including two Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards, twelve &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, and four MTV Video Music Awards. He was listed among &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 200 Greatest Singers of All Time and &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Greatest Hot 100 Artists of All Time. The Radio Academy named him the most played artist on British radio during the period 1984–2004. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023.

==Early life==
George Michael was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou () on 25 June 1963, in East Finchley. He was the only son and the youngest child of three. His father, Kyriacos &quot;Jack&quot; Panayiotou, was a Greek Cypriot restaurateur who emigrated from Patriki, Cyprus, to England in the 1950s. His mother, Lesley Angold (born Harrison, 1937–1997), was an English dancer. In June 2008, Michael told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that his maternal grandmother was Jewish, but she had married a non-Jewish man and raised their children with no knowledge of their Jewish background due to her fear during World War II.

Michael spent most of his childhood in Kingsbury, London, in the home his parents bought soon after his birth; he attended Roe Green Junior School and Kingsbury High School. Michael had two sisters: Yioda (born 1958) and Melanie (1960–2019). On BBC&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, Michael said that his interest in music followed an injury to his head around the age of eight.

==Early music==

While Michael was in his early teens, the family moved to Radlett.&lt;ref name=&quot;forunitedkingdomlovers/george-michael&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Negus/suburban-Wham&quot;&gt; PDF &lt;/ref&gt; There, Michael began attending Bushey Meads School in Bushey,&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc/43783251&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; where he, as &quot;Yog&quot;, met, sat down next to, and befriended, his future Wham! partner Andrew Ridgeley. The two had the same career ambition of being musicians. Michael busked on the London Underground, performing songs such as &quot;&#x27;39&quot; by Queen. His involvement in the music business began with his working as a DJ, playing at the Bel Air Restaurant in Northwood, London,&lt;ref name=&quot;watfordobserver/5729852&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gavin/George-Michael&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ridgeley/Wham-Memoir&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; clubs, and local schools around Bushey, Stanmore, and Watford. This was followed by the formation of a short-lived ska band called the Executive, with Ridgeley, Ridgeley&#x27;s brother Paul, Andrew Leaver, Jamie Gould, and David Mortimer (later known as David Austin).

== Wham! ==

Michael formed the duo Wham! with Andrew Ridgeley in 1981. On the cusp of fame, he decided to legally change his name to the more accessible George Michael. The band&#x27;s first album &quot;Fantastic&quot; reached No. 1 in the UK in 1983 and produced a series of top 10 singles including &quot;Young Guns&quot;, &quot;Wham Rap!&quot;, and &quot;Club Tropicana&quot;. Their second album, &quot;Make It Big&quot;, reached No. 1 on the charts in the US. Singles from that album included &quot;Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go&quot; (No. 1 in the UK and US), &quot;Freedom&quot;, &quot;Everything She Wants&quot;, and &quot;Careless Whisper&quot; which reached No. 1 in nearly 25 countries, including the UK and US, and was Michael&#x27;s first solo effort as a single. In December 1984, the single &quot;Last Christmas&quot; was released. In 1985 Michael received the first of his three Ivor Novello Awards for Songwriter of the Year from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.

Michael performed on the original 1984 Band Aid recording of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;—he appears third on the song after Paul Young and Boy George sing their lines. The song became the UK Christmas number one and Michael also donated the profits from &quot;Last Christmas&quot; and &quot;Everything She Wants&quot; to charity. Michael sang &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot; with Elton John at Live Aid at Wembley Stadium in London on 13 July 1985. He also contributed background vocals to David Cassidy&#x27;s 1985 hit &quot;The Last Kiss&quot;, as well as Elton John&#x27;s 1985 successes &quot;Nikita&quot; and &quot;Wrap Her Up&quot;. Michael cited Cassidy as a major career influence and interviewed Cassidy for David Litchfield&#x27;s &quot;Ritz Newspaper&quot;.
Wham!&#x27;s tour of China in April 1985, the first visit to China by a Western popular music act, generated worldwide media coverage, much of it centred on Michael. The headline in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; read: &quot;East meets Wham!, and another great wall comes down&quot;. Before Wham!&#x27;s appearance in China, many kinds of music in the country were forbidden. The band&#x27;s manager, Simon Napier-Bell, had spent 18 months trying to convince Chinese officials to let the duo play. The audience included members of the Chinese government. Chinese television presenter Kan Lijun, who was the on-stage host, spoke of Wham!&#x27;s historic performance: Wham! performed their hits with scantily clad dancers and strobing disco lights. According to Napier-Bell, Michael tried to get the crowd to clap along to &quot;Club Tropicana&quot;, but &quot;they hadn&#x27;t a clue – they thought he wanted applause and politely gave it&quot;, before adding that some Chinese did eventually &quot;get the hang of clapping on the beat.&quot; A UK embassy official in China stated &quot;there was some lively dancing but this was almost entirely confined to younger western members of the audience.&quot; The tour was documented by film director Lindsay Anderson and producer Martin Lewis in their film &quot;Wham! in China: Foreign Skies&quot;.

With the success of Michael&#x27;s solo singles, &quot;Careless Whisper&quot; (1984) and &quot;A Different Corner&quot; (1986), rumours of an impending break up of Wham! intensified. The duo officially separated in 1986, after releasing a farewell single, &quot;The Edge of Heaven&quot; and a farewell compilation, &quot;The Final&quot; (their third album &quot;Music from the Edge of Heaven&quot; was released in North America and Japan), plus a sell-out concert at Wembley Stadium that included the world premiere of the China film. The Wham! partnership ended officially with the commercially successful single &quot;The Edge of Heaven&quot;, which reached No. 1 on the UK chart in June 1986.

==Solo career==
===1987–1989===
During early 1987, at the beginning of his solo career, Michael released &quot;I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)&quot;, a duet with Aretha Franklin. &quot;I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)&quot; was a one-off project that helped Michael achieve an ambition by singing with one of his favourite artists. It scored number one on both the UK Singles Chart and the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 upon its release. For Michael, it became his third consecutive solo number one in the UK from three releases, after 1984&#x27;s &quot;Careless Whisper&quot; (though the single was actually from the Wham! album &quot;Make It Big&quot;) and 1986&#x27;s &quot;A Different Corner&quot;. The single was also the first Michael had recorded as a solo artist which he had not written himself. The co-writer, Simon Climie, was unknown at the time; he later had success as a performer with the band Climie Fisher in 1988. Michael and Franklin won a Grammy Award in 1988 for Best R&amp;B Performance – Duo or Group with Vocal for the song.

In late 1987, Michael released his debut solo album, &quot;Faith&quot;. The first single released from the album was &quot;I Want Your Sex&quot;, in mid-1987. The song was banned by many radio stations in the UK and US, due to its sexually suggestive lyrics. MTV broadcast the video, featuring celebrity make-up artist Kathy Jeung in a basque and suspenders, only during the late night hours. Michael argued that the act was beautiful if the sex was monogamous, and he recorded a brief prologue for the video in which he said: &quot;This song is not about casual sex.&quot; One of the racier scenes involved Michael writing the words &quot;explore monogamy&quot; on his partner&#x27;s back in lipstick. Some radio stations played a toned-down version of the song, &quot;I Want Your Love&quot;, with the word &quot;love&quot; replacing &quot;sex&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sex/love&quot;&gt;80s Singers: George Michael Total 80s Remix, 22 February 1999. Retrieved 21 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

When &quot;I Want Your Sex&quot; reached the US charts, &quot;American Top 40&quot; host Casey Kasem refused to say the song&#x27;s title, referring to it only as &quot;the new single by George Michael.&quot; In the US, the song was also sometimes listed as &quot;I Want Your Sex (from &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot;)&quot;, since the song was featured on the soundtrack of the movie. Despite censorship and radio play problems, &quot;I Want Your Sex&quot; reached No. 2 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 3 in the UK. The second single, &quot;Faith&quot;, was released in October 1987, a few weeks before the album. &quot;Faith&quot; became one of his most popular songs. The song was No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for four consecutive weeks, becoming the best-selling single of 1988 in the US. It also reached No. 1 in Australia, and No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart. The video provided some definitive images of the 1980s music industry in the process—Michael in shades, leather jacket, cowboy boots, and Levi&#x27;s jeans, playing a guitar near a classic-design jukebox.

On 30 October, &quot;Faith&quot; was released in the UK and in several markets worldwide. &quot;Faith&quot; topped the UK Albums Chart, and in the US, the album had 51 non-consecutive weeks in the top 10 of &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, including 12 weeks at No. 1. &quot;Faith&quot; had many successes, with four singles (&quot;Faith&quot;, &quot;Father Figure&quot;, &quot;One More Try&quot;, and &quot;Monkey&quot;) reaching No. 1 in the US. &quot;Faith&quot; was certified Diamond by the RIAA for sales of 10 million copies in the US. To date, global sales of &quot;Faith&quot; are more than 25 million units. The album was highly acclaimed by music critics, with AllMusic journalist Steve Huey describing it as a &quot;superbly crafted mainstream pop/rock masterpiece&quot; and &quot;one of the finest pop albums of the &#x27;80s&quot;. In a review by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, journalist Mark Coleman commended most of the songs on the album, which he said &quot;displays Michael&#x27;s intuitive understanding of pop music and his increasingly intelligent use of his power to communicate to an ever-growing audience.&quot;

In 1988, Michael embarked on a world tour. In Los Angeles, Michael was joined on stage by Aretha Franklin for &quot;I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)&quot;. It was the second highest grossing event of 1988, earning $17.7 million. At the 1988 Brit Awards held at the Royal Albert Hall on 8 February, Michael received the first of his two awards for Best British Male Solo Artist. Later that month, &quot;Faith&quot; won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the 31st Grammy Awards. At the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards on 6 September in Los Angeles, Michael received the Video Vanguard Award. According to Michael in his film, &quot;A Different Story&quot;, success did not make him happy and he started to think there was something wrong in being an idol for millions of teenage girls. The whole &quot;Faith&quot; process (promotion, videos, tour, awards) left him exhausted, lonely and frustrated, and far from his friends and family. In 1990, he told his record company Sony that, for his second album, he did not want to do promotions like the one for &quot;Faith&quot;.

===1990s===
&quot;Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1&quot; was released in September 1990. The title is an indication of his desire to be taken more seriously as a songwriter. The album was released in Europe on 3 September 1990, and one week later in the US. It reached No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart and peaked at No. 2 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It spent a total of 88 weeks on the UK Albums Chart and was certified four-times Platinum by the BPI. The album produced five UK singles, all of which were released within an eight-month period: &quot;Praying for Time&quot;, &quot;Waiting for That Day&quot;, &quot;Freedom! &#x27;90&quot;, &quot;Heal the Pain&quot;, and &quot;Cowboys and Angels&quot; (the latter being his only single not to chart in the UK top 40). Michael refused to do any promotion for the album. At the 1991 Brit Awards, &quot;Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1&quot; won the award for Best British Album.

The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Praying for Time&quot;, with lyrics concerning social ills and injustice, was released in August 1990. James Hunter of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine described the song as &quot;a distraught look at the world&#x27;s astounding woundedness. Michael offers the healing passage of time as the only balm for physical and emotional hunger, poverty, hypocrisy, and hatred.&quot; The song was an instant success, reaching No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 6 in the UK. A video was released shortly thereafter, consisting of the lyrics on a dark background. Michael did not appear in this video or any subsequent videos for the album. The second single from &quot;Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1&quot;, &quot;Waiting for That Day&quot;, was an acoustic-heavy single, released as an immediate follow-up to &quot;Praying for Time&quot;.

&quot;Freedom! &#x27;90&quot; was the second of only two singles from &quot;Listen Without Prejudice&quot; to be supported by a music video (the other being the Michael-less &quot;Praying for Time&quot;). The song alludes to his struggles with his artistic identity, and prophesied his efforts shortly thereafter to end his recording contract with Sony Music. As if to prove the song&#x27;s sentiment, Michael refused to appear in the video (directed by David Fincher), and instead recruited supermodels Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Tatjana Patitz, and Cindy Crawford to appear in and lip sync in his stead. It also featured lyrics critical of his sex symbol status. It reached No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the US, and No. 28 on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Mother&#x27;s Pride&quot; gained significant radio play in the US during the first Persian Gulf War during 1991, often with radio stations mixing in callers&#x27; tributes to soldiers with the music.

Later in 1991, Michael embarked on the Cover to Cover tour in Japan, England, the US, and Brazil, where he performed at Rock in Rio. The tour was not a proper promotion for &quot;Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1&quot;. Rather, it featured Michael singing his favourite cover songs. Among his favourites was &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot;, a 1974 song by Elton John; Michael and John had performed the song together at the Live Aid concert in 1985, and again for Michael&#x27;s concert at London&#x27;s Wembley Arena on 25 March 1991, where the duet was recorded. &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot; was released as a single at the end of 1991 and reached No. 1 in both the UK and US. In 1991, Michael released an autobiography through Penguin Books titled &quot;Bare&quot;, co-written with Tony Parsons.

An expected follow-up album, &quot;Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 2&quot;, was scrapped due to Michael&#x27;s lawsuit with Sony. Instead, Michael donated three songs to the charity project &quot;Red Hot + Dance&quot;, for the Red Hot Organization which raised money for AIDS awareness; a fourth track, &quot;Crazyman Dance&quot;, was the B-side of 1992&#x27;s &quot;Too Funky&quot;. Michael donated the royalties from &quot;Too Funky&quot; to the same cause. &quot;Too Funky&quot; reached No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.
Michael performed with Queen at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert on 20 April 1992 at Wembley Stadium. The concert was a tribute to the life of the late Queen frontman, Freddie Mercury, with the proceeds going to AIDS research. Michael performed &quot;&#x27;39&quot;, &quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot; with Lisa Stansfield and &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;. Michael&#x27;s performance of &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; was hailed as &quot;one of the best performances of the tribute concert&quot;. Michael later reflected, &quot;It was probably the proudest moment for me of my career, because it was me living out a childhood fantasy, I suppose, to sing one of Freddie&#x27;s songs in front of 80,000 people.&quot;

The &quot;Five Live&quot; EP featured five live recordings (six in several countries) performed by Michael, Queen, and Lisa Stansfield. &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; and &quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot; were recorded at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. &quot;Killer&quot;, &quot;Papa Was a Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot;, and &quot;Calling You&quot; were recorded during his Cover to Cover tour in 1991.
All proceeds from the sale of the EP benefited the Mercury Phoenix Trust. Sales of the EP were strong through Europe, where it debuted at No. 1 in the UK and several European countries. Chart success in the US was less spectacular, where it reached No. 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (&quot;Somebody to Love&quot; reached No. 30 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100). The performance would later feature on Queen&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Greatest Hits III&quot;.

During November 1994, after a long period of seclusion, Michael appeared at the first MTV Europe Music Awards show, where he gave a performance of a new song, &quot;Jesus to a Child&quot;. The song was a melancholy tribute to his lover, Anselmo Feleppa, who had died in March 1993. The song entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 1 and No. 7 on &quot;Billboard&quot; upon release in 1996. It was Michael&#x27;s longest UK Top 40 single, at almost seven minutes long. The exact identity of the song&#x27;s subject—and the nature of Michael&#x27;s relationship with Feleppa—was shrouded in innuendo and speculation, as Michael had not confirmed he was homosexual and did not do so until 1998. The video for &quot;Jesus to a Child&quot; was a picture of images recalling loss, pain and suffering. Michael consistently dedicated the song to Feleppa before performing it live.

Michael released &quot;Fastlove&quot;, an energetic tune about wanting gratification and fulfilment without commitment, in 1996. The single version was nearly five minutes long. &quot;Fastlove&quot; was supported by a futuristic virtual reality-related video. The single reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart, spending three weeks at the top spot. In the US, &quot;Fastlove&quot; peaked at No. 8. Following &quot;Fastlove&quot;, Michael released &quot;Older&quot;, his third studio album. In the UK, the album was particularly notable for producing a record six top three hit singles in a two-year span.

In 1996, Michael was voted Best British Male at the MTV Europe Music Awards and the Brit Awards; and at the British Academy&#x27;s Ivor Novello Awards, he was awarded the title of Songwriter of the Year for the third time. Michael performed a concert at Three Mills Studios, London, for &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;. It was his first long performance in years, and in the audience was Michael&#x27;s mother, who died of cancer the following year.

&quot;Ladies &amp; Gentlemen: The Best of George Michael&quot; (1998) was Michael&#x27;s first solo greatest hits collection. The collection of 28 songs (29 songs are included on the European and Australian release) are separated into two-halves, with each containing a particular theme and mood. The first CD, titled &quot;For the Heart&quot;, predominantly contains ballads; the second CD, &quot;For the Feet&quot;, consists mainly of dance tunes. It was released through Sony Music Entertainment as a condition of severing contractual ties with the label. &quot;Ladies &amp; Gentlemen&quot; was a success, peaking at No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart for eight weeks. It spent over 200 weeks in the UK chart, and is the 45th best-selling album ever in the UK. It is certified seven-times platinum in the UK and multi-platinum in the US, and is Michael&#x27;s most commercially successful album in his homeland, having sold more than 2.8 million copies. As of 2013, the album had reached worldwide sales of approximately 15 million copies. The first single of the album, &quot;Outside&quot;, was a humorous song making a reference to his arrest for soliciting a policeman in a public toilet. &quot;As&quot;, his duet with Mary J. Blige, was released as the second single in many territories around the world. Both singles reached the top 5 in the UK Singles Chart.

Released in 1999, &quot;Songs from the Last Century&quot; is a studio album of cover tracks. The album achieved the lowest peak of his solo efforts, peaking at No. 157 on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart and at No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart.

===2000s===

In 2000, Michael worked on the hit single &quot;If I Told You That&quot; with Whitney Houston. Michael co-produced on the single along with Rodney Jerkins. Michael&#x27;s first single from his fifth studio album, &quot;Freeek!&quot;, reached the Top 10 in the UK. His next single was &quot;Shoot the Dog&quot; which was released in July 2002 during the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The video for the song showed Tony Blair as George Bush&#x27;s poodle. The single&#x27;s cover featured the &quot;Daily Mirror&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Howdy Poodle&quot; front page from earlier in the year. Responding to criticism, Michael said, &quot;I am British, I live here, I pay my taxes, and I&#x27;m very, very worried that we are now the second most dangerous country in the world thanks to our special relationship with America.&quot; It reached No. 1 in Denmark and made the top 5 in most European charts. It peaked at No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart.

In February 2003, Michael recorded another song in protest against the looming Iraq war, Don McLean&#x27;s &quot;The Grave&quot;. The original was written by McLean in 1971 and was a protest against the Vietnam War. Michael performed the song on numerous TV shows including &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and &quot;So Graham Norton&quot;. His performance of the song on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 7 March 2003 was his first studio appearance on the programme since 1986. He ran into conflict with the show&#x27;s producers for an anti-war, anti-Blair T-shirt worn by some members of his band. McLean stated that he was &quot;proud of George Michael for standing up for life and sanity&quot;.
When Michael&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Patience&quot;, was released in 2004, it was critically acclaimed and went to No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart. The album became one of the fastest-selling albums in the UK, selling over 200,000 copies in the first week alone. It reached the Top 5 on most European charts and peaked at No. 12 in the US, selling over 500,000 copies to earn a Gold certification from the RIAA. &quot;Amazing&quot;, the third single from the album, became a No. 1 hit in Europe. When Michael appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; on 26 May 2004, to promote the album, he performed &quot;Amazing&quot;, along with his classic songs &quot;Father Figure&quot; and &quot;Faith&quot;. On the show, Michael spoke of his arrest, the public revelation of his homosexuality, and his resumption of public performances. He allowed Oprah&#x27;s crew inside his home outside London. The fourth single taken off the album was &quot;Flawless&quot;. It was a dance hit in Europe as well as North America, reaching No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play and becoming Michael&#x27;s last No. 1 single on the US Dance chart. &quot;Twenty Five&quot; is Michael&#x27;s second greatest hits album, celebrating the 25th anniversary of his music career. Released in November 2006 by Sony BMG, it debuted at no. 1 in the UK.
During the 2005 Live 8 concert at Hyde Park, London, Michael joined Paul McCartney on stage, harmonising on The Beatles classic &quot;Drive My Car&quot;. In 2006, Michael embarked on his first tour in 15 years, 25 Live. The tour began in Barcelona, Spain, on 23 September and finished in December at Wembley Arena in England. On 9 June 2007, Michael became the first artist to perform live at the newly renovated Wembley Stadium in London. On 25 March 2008, a third part of the 25 Live Tour was announced for North America, with 21 dates in the US and Canada.

Michael made his American acting debut by playing a guardian angel to Jonny Lee Miller&#x27;s character on &quot;Eli Stone&quot;, a US TV series. Each episode of the show&#x27;s first season was named after a song of his. Michael also appeared on the 2008 finale show of &quot;American Idol&quot; on 21 May, singing &quot;Praying for Time&quot;. When asked what he thought Simon Cowell would say of his performance, he replied &quot;I think he&#x27;ll probably tell me I shouldn&#x27;t have done a George Michael song. He&#x27;s told plenty of people that in the past, so I think that&#x27;d be quite funny.&quot; On 25 December 2008, Michael released a new Christmas-themed track, &quot;December Song (I Dreamed of Christmas)&quot;, on his website for free.

===2010s===

In early 2010, Michael performed his first concerts in Australia since 1988. On 20 February 2010, Michael performed his first show in Perth at the Burswood Dome to an audience of 15,000. On 2 March 2011, Michael announced the release of his cover version of New Order&#x27;s 1987 hit &quot;True Faith&quot; in aid of the UK charity telethon Comic Relief. Michael appeared on Comic Relief itself, featuring in the first Carpool Karaoke sketch of James Corden, with the pair singing songs while Corden drove around London. On 15 April 2011, Michael released a cover of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s 1972 song, &quot;You and I&quot;, as an MP3 gift to Prince William and Catherine Middleton on the occasion of their wedding on 29 April 2011. Although the MP3 was released for free download, Michael appealed to those who downloaded the track to make a contribution to &quot;The Prince William &amp; Miss Catherine Middleton Charitable Gift Fund&quot;.
The Symphonica Tour began at the Prague State Opera House on 22 August 2011. In October 2011, Michael was announced as one of the final nominees for the Songwriter&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In November, he had to cancel the remainder of the tour as he became ill with pneumonia in Vienna, Austria, ultimately slipping into a coma.

In February 2012, two months after leaving hospital, Michael made a surprise appearance at the 2012 Brit Awards at the O2 Arena in London, where he received a standing ovation, and presented Adele the award for Best British Album. In March, Michael announced that he was healthy and that the Symphonica Tour would resume in autumn. The final concert of the tour—which was also the final concert of Michael&#x27;s life–was performed at London&#x27;s Earls Court on 17 October 2012.

&quot;Symphonica&quot; was released on 17 March 2014, and became Michael&#x27;s seventh solo No. 1 album in the UK, and ninth overall including his Wham! chart-toppers. The album was produced by Phil Ramone and Michael; the album was Ramone&#x27;s last production credit. On 2 November 2016, Michael&#x27;s management team announced that a second documentary on his life, entitled &quot;Freedom&quot;, was set to be released in March 2017. A month after, English songwriter Naughty Boy confirmed plans to collaborate with Michael, for a new song and album. Naughty Boy claimed that the song is &quot;amazing but [...] bittersweet&quot;. On 7 September 2017 (months after Michael&#x27;s death), the single &quot;Fantasy&quot;, featuring Nile Rodgers, was released.

Having charted at number two upon its release in 1984 (behind Band Aid&#x27;s &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; which Michael also performed in), &quot;Last Christmas&quot; finally reached number-one in the UK Singles Chart on New Year&#x27;s Day 2021 (chart week ending date 7 January 2021), more than 36 years after its initial release. Andrew Ridgeley said the chart placing was &quot;a testament to its timeless appeal and charm&quot;, adding: &quot;It is a fitting tribute to George&#x27;s song-writing genius... he would have been immensely proud and utterly thrilled.&quot; The period of 36 years taken to reach number one was a UK chart record, which would be surpassed by Kate Bush with &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; in June 2022 which took 37 years. &quot;Last Christmas&quot; would become the UK Christmas number one for the first time in 2023, and it hit number one again at Christmas in 2024, making it the first song to top the Christmas chart in consecutive years, and become only the third song to top the festive chart more than once after Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; and &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;.

==Posthumous releases==
On 7 September 2017, Michael&#x27;s estate released the single &quot;Fantasy&quot;. Written and produced by Michael, was recorded while he was working on &quot;Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1&quot;. However, the track was not included on the album. Instead in October 1990, it was featured on the &quot;Waiting for That Day&quot; single in the United Kingdom and on the &quot;Freedom! &#x27;90&quot; single in the rest of the world. On 7 September 2017, a new version reworked by Nile Rodgers was released as a single from &quot;Listen Without Prejudice / MTV Unplugged&quot; (2017). The album includes the original version of &quot;Fantasy&quot; and the 1998 version; the Nile Rodgers remix was not included on the disc but was made available to purchasers as a digital download. On 18 October 2017, a music video was released on Vevo.

In 2019, the Emma Thompson-written film &quot;Last Christmas&quot; was released. The title of the film is taken from the Wham! classic. An official soundtrack album was released by Legacy Recordings on CD, two-disc vinyl, and digital formats on 8 November 2019. The album contains 14 Wham! and solo George Michael songs, as well as a previously unreleased song originally completed in 2015 titled &quot;This Is How (We Want You to Get High)&quot;. The soundtrack album debuted at number one on the UK Official Soundtrack Albums Chart and at number 11 on the UK Albums Chart on 15 November 2019. It also entered the Australian Albums Chart at number seven, the Irish Albums Chart, where it debuted at number 32, climbing to number 26 the following week, and at number 55 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

On 22 June 2022, the documentary film &quot;Freedom Uncut&quot; was released. Michael had been working on the film shortly before his death, alongside David Austin, and provides the narration throughout. &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;Empire&quot; all praised the film and rated it 4/5 stars. On 30 September 2022, a remastered and expanded version of &quot;Older&quot; was released comprising the original &quot;Older&quot; album, the &quot;Upper&quot; disc and three bonus CDs, containing remixes and live recordings of &quot;Older&quot;-era tracks. The album charted at number 2 on the UK Official Albums Chart Top 100 on 7 October 2022.

==Personal life==
===Sexuality and relationships===
Michael stated that his early fantasies were about women, which &quot;led me to believe I was on the path to heterosexuality&quot;, but at puberty he started to fantasise about men, which he later said &quot;had something to do with my environment&quot;. At the age of 19, Michael told Andrew Ridgeley that he was bisexual. Michael also told one of his two sisters, but he was advised not to tell his parents about his sexuality. In 1998, not long after he was outed for his sexuality, Michael said on &quot;Parkinson&quot; that he became confident he was gay when he fell in love with a man. This stance was reiterated in a 1999 interview with &quot;The Advocate&quot;, where Michael told the editor-in-chief, Judy Wieder, that it was &quot;falling in love with a man that ended his conflict over bisexuality&quot;.
&quot;I never had a moral problem with being gay&quot;, Michael told her. &quot;I thought I had fallen in love with a woman a couple of times. Then I fell in love with a man, and realised that none of those things had been love.&quot;

In 2004, Michael said, &quot;I used to sleep with women quite a lot in the Wham! days but never felt it could develop into a relationship because I knew that, emotionally, I was a gay man. I didn&#x27;t want to commit to them, but I was attracted to them. Then I became ashamed that I might be using them. I decided I had to stop, which I did when I began to worry about AIDS, which was becoming prevalent in Britain. Although I had always had safe sex, I didn&#x27;t want to sleep with a woman without telling her I was bisexual. I felt that would be irresponsible. Basically, I didn&#x27;t want to have that uncomfortable conversation that might ruin the moment, so I stopped sleeping with them.&quot; In the same interview, he added: &quot;If I wasn&#x27;t with Kenny [his boyfriend at the time], I would have sex with women, no question&quot;. He said he believed that the formation of his sexuality was &quot;a nurture thing, via the absence of my father who was always busy working. It meant I was exceptionally close to my mother&quot;, though he stated that &quot;there are definitely those who have a predisposition to being gay in which the environment is irrelevant.&quot; In 2007, Michael said he had hidden his sexuality because of worries over what effect it might have on his mother. Two years later, he added: &quot;My depression at the end of Wham! was because I was beginning to realise I was gay, not bisexual.&quot;

During the late 1980s, Michael had a relationship with make-up artist Kathy Jeung, who was regarded for a time as his artistic &quot;muse&quot; and who appeared in the &quot;I Want Your Sex&quot; video. Michael later said that she had been his &quot;only bona fide&quot; girlfriend, and that she knew of his bisexuality. In 2016, Jeung reacted to Michael&#x27;s death by calling him a &quot;true friend&quot; with whom she had spent &quot;some of the best time of [her] life&quot;.

In 1991, Michael established a relationship with Anselmo Feleppa, a Brazilian dress designer whom he had met at the Rock in Rio concert in January that year. Six months into their relationship, Feleppa discovered that he was HIV-positive. Michael later said: &quot;It was terrifying news. I thought I could have the disease too. I couldn&#x27;t go through it with my family because I didn&#x27;t know how to share it with them – they didn&#x27;t even know I was gay.&quot; In 1993, Feleppa died of an AIDS-related brain haemorrhage. Michael&#x27;s single, &quot;Jesus to a Child&quot;, is a tribute to Feleppa (Michael consistently dedicated it to him before performing it live), as is his album &quot;Older&quot; (1996). In 2008, speaking about the loss of Feleppa, Michael said: &quot;It was a terribly depressing time. It took about three years to grieve, then after that I lost my mother. I felt almost like I was cursed.&quot;

In 1996, Michael entered into a long-term relationship with Kenny Goss, a former flight attendant, cheerleading coach, and sportswear executive from Dallas, Texas. They had a home in Dallas, a 16th-century house in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, and an £8 million mansion in Highgate, North London. In late November 2005, it was reported that Michael and Goss planned to register their relationship as a civil partnership in the UK, but because of negative publicity and his upcoming tour, they postponed their plans. On 22 August 2011, the opening night of his Symphonica Tour, Michael announced that he and Goss had split two years earlier.

Michael&#x27;s homosexuality became publicly known following his April 1998 arrest for public lewdness. In 2007, Michael said &quot;that hiding his sexuality made him feel &#x27;fraudulent&#x27;, and his eventual outing, when he was arrested [...] in 1998, was a subconsciously deliberate act.&quot; In 2012, Michael entered a relationship with Fadi Fawaz, a Lebanese-Australian celebrity hairstylist and freelance photographer based in London. It was Fawaz who found Michael&#x27;s body on Christmas morning 2016.

===Legal troubles===
On 7 April 1998, Michael was arrested for &quot;engaging in a lewd act&quot; in a public restroom of the Will Rogers Memorial Park in Beverly Hills, California. Michael was arrested by undercover policeman Marcelo Rodríguez in a sting operation. In an MTV interview, Michael stated: &quot;I got followed into the restroom and then this cop—I didn&#x27;t know it was a cop, obviously—he started playing this game, which I think is called, &#x27;I&#x27;ll show you mine, you show me yours, and then when you show me yours, I&#x27;m going to you!&#x27;&quot;
After pleading &quot;no contest&quot; to the charge, Michael was fined US$810 and sentenced to 80 hours of community service. Soon afterwards, Michael made a video for his single &quot;Outside&quot;, which satirised the public toilet incident and featured men dressed as policemen kissing. Rodríguez claimed that this video &quot;mocked&quot; him, and that Michael had slandered him in interviews. In 1999, he brought a US$10 million court case in California against the singer. The court dismissed the case, but an appellate court reinstated it on 3 December 2002. The court then ruled that Rodríguez, as a public official, could not legally recover damages for emotional distress.

On 23 July 2006, Michael was again accused of engaging in anonymous public sex, this time at London&#x27;s Hampstead Heath. Michael stated that his cruising for anonymous sex was not an issue in his relationship with partner Kenny Goss.

In February 2006, Michael was arrested for possession of Class C drugs, an incident that he described as &quot;my own stupid fault, as usual&quot;. He was cautioned by the police and released. In 2007, he pleaded guilty to drug-impaired driving after obstructing the road at traffic lights in Cricklewood in northwest London, and was subsequently banned from driving for two years and sentenced to community service. On 19 September 2008, Michael was arrested in a public convenience in the Hampstead Heath area for possession of Class A and C drugs. He was taken to the police station and cautioned for controlled substance possession.

In the early hours of 4 July 2010, Michael was returning from the Gay Pride parade, when he was spotted on CCTV crashing his car into the front of a Snappy Snaps store in Hampstead, north London, and was arrested on suspicion of being unfit to drive. On 12 August, London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police said he was &quot;charged with possession of cannabis and with driving while unfit through drink or drugs&quot;. It was reported that Michael had also been taking the prescription tricyclic antidepressant medication amitriptyline. On 24 August 2010, the singer pleaded guilty at Highbury Corner Magistrates&#x27; Court in London after admitting driving under the influence of drugs. On 14 September 2010, at the same court, Michael was sentenced to eight weeks in prison, a fine, and a five-year ban from driving. Michael was released from Highpoint Prison in Suffolk on 11 October 2010, after serving four weeks. In the dent in the shop wall Michael had crashed into, someone graffitied the word &quot;Wham&quot;.

===Health===
Michael struggled with substance abuse for many years. He was arrested for drug-related offences in 2006, 2008 and 2010. In September 2007, on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, Michael said that his cannabis use was a problem; he wished he could smoke less of it and was constantly trying to do so. On 5 December 2009, in an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Michael explained he had cut back on cannabis and was smoking only &quot;seven or eight&quot; spliffs per day instead of the 25 per day he had formerly smoked. Michael also abused sleeping pills.

On 26 October 2011, Michael cancelled a performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London due to a viral infection. On 21 November, Vienna General Hospital admitted Michael after he complained of chest pains while at a hotel two hours before his performance at a venue there for his Symphonica Tour. Michael appeared to be &quot;in good spirits&quot; and responded well to treatment following his admission, but on 25 November hospital officials said that his condition had &quot;worsened overnight&quot;. This development led to cancellations and postponements of Michael&#x27;s remaining 2011 performances, which had been scheduled mainly for the United Kingdom. The singer was later confirmed to have suffered from pneumonia and, until 1 December, was in an intensive care unit; at one point, he was comatose. On 21 December, the hospital discharged him. Michael told the press that he had undergone a tracheotomy, that the staff at the hospital had saved his life, and that he would perform a free concert for them. After waking from the coma, Michael had a temporary West Country accent, and there was concern he had developed foreign accent syndrome.

On 16 May 2013, Michael sustained a head injury in a car accident on the M1 motorway, near St Albans in Hertfordshire and was airlifted to hospital. On 29 May, Michael&#x27;s publicist confirmed that he had left the hospital and that his injuries were superficial. In 2014, Michael stated that he had refrained from using cannabis for one and one half years. In June 2015, he checked into a drug rehabilitation facility in Switzerland.

===Politics===
Michael&#x27;s father was a communist. At the age of fifteen, Michael joined the Young Communist League, under his Greek name. During the time of Margaret Thatcher as the Conservative Prime Minister of the United Kingdom throughout the 1980s, Michael voted Labour. In September 1984, Wham! performed at a benefit concert at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall for the striking UK miners.

In 2000, Michael joined Melissa Etheridge, Garth Brooks, Queen Latifah, Pet Shop Boys, and k.d. lang, to perform in Washington, D.C. as part of Equality Rocks, a concert to benefit the Human Rights Campaign, an American LGBT rights group. His 2002 single &quot;Shoot the Dog&quot; was critical of the friendly relationship between the UK and US governments, in particular the relationship between Tony Blair and George W. Bush, with their involvement in the War on Terror. Michael voiced his concern about the lack of public consultation in the UK regarding the War on Terror: &quot;On an issue as enormous as the possible bombing of Iraq, how can you represent us when you haven&#x27;t asked us what we think?&quot;

In 2006, Michael performed a free concert for NHS nurses in London to thank the nurses who had cared for his late mother. He told the audience: &quot;Thank you for everything you do — some people appreciate it. Now if we can only get the government to do the same thing.&quot;

In 2007, Michael sent the £1,450,000 piano that John Lennon used to write &quot;Imagine&quot; around the United States on a &quot;peace tour&quot;, displaying at places where notable acts of violence had taken place, such as Dallas&#x27; Dealey Plaza, where US President John F. Kennedy had been shot. He devoted his 2007 concert in Sofia, from his 25 Live tour to the Bulgarian nurses prosecuted in the HIV trial in Libya. On 17 June 2008, Michael said he was thrilled by California&#x27;s legalisation of same-sex marriage, calling the move &quot;way overdue&quot;.

===Philanthropy===
In November 1984, Michael joined other British and Irish pop stars of the era to form Band Aid, singing on the charity song &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; for famine relief in Ethiopia. This single became the UK Christmas number one in December 1984, holding Michael&#x27;s own song, &quot;Last Christmas&quot; by Wham!, at No. 2. &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; sold 3.75 million copies in the UK and became the biggest-selling single in UK chart history, a title it held until 1997 when it was overtaken by Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Candle in the Wind 1997&quot;, released in tribute to Princess Diana following her death (Michael attended Diana&#x27;s funeral with Elton John). Michael donated the royalties from &quot;Last Christmas&quot; to Band Aid and subsequently sang with Elton John at Live Aid (the Band Aid charity concert) in 1985.

In 1986, Michael took part in the Prince&#x27;s Trust charity concert held at Wembley Arena, performing &quot;Everytime You Go Away&quot; alongside Paul Young. In 1988, Michael participated in the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute at Wembley Stadium in London together with many other singers (such as Annie Lennox and Sting), performing &quot;Sexual Healing&quot;.

An LGBT rights campaigner and HIV/AIDS charity fundraiser, the proceeds from the 1991 single &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot; were divided among 10 different charities for children, AIDS and education. He was also a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation. Michael wore a red ribbon at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert at Wembley Stadium in April 1992. He was instrumental in bringing the compilation CD &quot;Red Hot + Dance&quot; to fruition, contributing three original songs, with the album featuring Seal and Madonna among others.

In 2003, he paired up with Ronan Keating on the UK edition of the game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; and won £32,000, after having their original £64,000 winnings halved by answering the £125,000 question incorrectly. The same year, Michael joined other celebrities to support a campaign to help raise £20 million for terminally ill children run by the Rainbow Trust Children&#x27;s Charity of which he was a patron. He said: &quot;Loss is such an incredibly difficult thing. I bow down to people who actually have to deal with the loss of a child.&quot;
From 2005 until his death, Michael was a patron of the Swan Lifeline charity. At the time he had moved to his home in Highgate, he had swans in the river at the end of his garden. A neighbour, who was involved with the charity, asked him if he would be interested, and he immediately agreed.

Following Michael&#x27;s death, various charities revealed that Michael had privately supported them for many years. Those charities included Childline (to whom he had donated &quot;millions&quot;), the Terrence Higgins Trust, and Macmillan Cancer Support. Michael also donated to individuals: he reportedly called the production team of the quiz show &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; after a contestant had revealed that she needed £15,000 to fund IVF treatment and anonymously paid for the treatment. Michael once tipped a student nurse working as a barmaid £5,000 because she was in debt. On 3 January 2017, another woman came forward and (with the permission of Michael&#x27;s family) revealed he had anonymously paid for her IVF treatment after seeing her talk about her problems conceiving on an episode of &quot;This Morning&quot; in 2010. The woman gave birth to a girl in 2012.

After his death, it was also revealed that Michael had been anonymously paying for an annual Christmas tree erected where he lived in Highgate, as well as funding the Christmas lights, for the previous decade. He was also the largest funder of Highgate&#x27;s annual Fair in the Square for those ten years, donating anonymously as &quot;a local resident&quot;.

===Assets===
Between 2006 and 2008, according to reports, Michael earned £48.5 million from the 25 Live tour alone. In July 2014, he was reported to have been a celebrity investor in a tax avoidance scheme called Liberty. According to the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List 2015 of the wealthiest British musicians, Michael was worth £105 million.

==Death==

In the early hours of Christmas Day 2016, Michael died in bed at his home in Goring-on-Thames, at the age of 53. He was found by his partner, Fadi Fawaz. In March 2017, a senior coroner in Oxfordshire attributed Michael&#x27;s death to natural causes due to dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis and a fatty liver.

Owing to the delay in determining the cause of death, Michael&#x27;s funeral was held on 29 March 2017. In a private ceremony, he was buried at Highgate Cemetery in north London, on one side of his mother&#x27;s grave. His sister Melanie, who died after him three years to the day, is buried on the other side.

===Aftermath===

In the summer of 2017, a temporary informal memorial garden was created outside Michael&#x27;s former home in The Grove, Highgate. The site, in a private square that Michael had owned, was tended by fans for approximately eighteen months until it was cleared.

In March 2019, Michael&#x27;s art collection was auctioned in England for £11.3 million. The proceeds were donated to various philanthropic organisations Michael gave to while he was alive.

Michael&#x27;s will left most of his £97 million estate to his sisters, his father and friends. It did not include bequests to either Fawaz or to his former partner, Kenny Goss. In 2021, following legal proceedings, the trustees of Michael&#x27;s estate entered into a financial settlement with Goss.

==Tributes==

Elton John was among those who paid tribute to Michael, emotionally addressing the audience in Las Vegas on 28 December, &quot;What a singer, what a songwriter. But more than anything as a human being he was one of the kindest, sweetest, most generous people I&#x27;ve ever met.&quot;

At the 59th Annual Grammy Awards on 12 February 2017, Adele performed a slow version of &quot;Fastlove&quot; in tribute to Michael. On 22 February, Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin performed &quot;A Different Corner&quot; at the 2017 Brit Awards. In June, Michael&#x27;s close friend, former Spice Girls member Geri Halliwell, released a charity single, &quot;Angels in Chains&quot;, a tribute to him, to raise money for Childline.

In 2020, Michael was commemorated with a mural in his native borough of Brent. The artwork, which formed part of the Brent Biennial, was commissioned to pay tribute to his contribution to the fields of music and entertainment. Artist Dawn Mellor said it celebrates the singer as a pioneering cultural and LGBTQ+ figure. In February 2024, the Royal Mint unveiled a collectable coin featuring Michael wearing his trademark sunglasses.

==Awards and achievements==

Michael won numerous music awards throughout his 30-year career, including five Brit Awards—winning Best British Male Artist twice, four MTV Video Music Awards, six Ivor Novello Awards, four American Music Awards (including two in the traditionally-black Soul/R&amp;B category), and two Grammy Awards from eight nominations. In 2015, he was ranked 45th in &quot;Billboard&quot;″s list of the &quot;Greatest Hot 100 Artists of All Time&quot;. The Radio Academy stated that Michael was the most frequently played artist on British radio during the period 1984–2004. In 2019, Michael was named as the greatest artist of all time by Smooth Radio.
In 2023, Michael was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. On 3 May 2023, Michael was selected as an inductee to the 2023 class alongside Kate Bush, Willie Nelson, The Spinners, Missy Elliott and Rage Against the Machine. In November 2023, Michael was inducted into the Hall, with Andrew Ridgeley as his induction presenter.

==Discography and record sales==
At the time of his death, Michael was estimated to have sold between 100 million and 125 million records worldwide. As a solo artist, he is estimated to have sold over 100 million records, making him one of the best-selling music artists. He is estimated to have sold up to 30 million records with Wham!. His debut solo album &quot;Faith&quot; sold more than 25 million copies.

<text>A building or edifice is an enclosed structure with a roof and walls, usually standing permanently in one place, such as a house or factory. Buildings come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and functions, and have been adapted throughout history for numerous factors, from building materials available, to weather conditions, land prices, ground conditions, specific uses, prestige, and aesthetic reasons. To better understand the concept, see &quot;Nonbuilding structure&quot; for contrast. 

Buildings serve several societal needs – occupancy, primarily as shelter from weather, security, living space, privacy, to store belongings, and to comfortably live and work. A building as a shelter represents a physical separation of the human habitat (a place of comfort and safety) from the &quot;outside&quot; (a place that may be harsh and harmful at times).

Ever since the first cave paintings, buildings have been objects or canvasses of much artistic expression. In recent years, interest in sustainable planning and building practices has become an intentional part of the design process of many new buildings and other structures, usually green buildings.

== Definition ==

A building is &#x27;a structure that has a roof and walls and stands more or less permanently in one place&#x27;; &quot;there was a three-storey building on the corner&quot;; &quot;it was an imposing edifice&quot;. In the broadest interpretation a fence or wall is a building. However, the word &quot;structure&quot; is used more broadly than &quot;building&quot;, to include natural and human-made formations and ones that do not have walls; &quot;structure&quot; is more often used for a fence. Sturgis&#x27; Dictionary included that differs from architecture in excluding all idea of artistic treatment; and it differs from construction in the idea of excluding scientific or highly skilful treatment.&quot;

&quot;Structural height&quot; in technical usage is the height to the highest architectural detail on the building from street level. Spires and masts may or may not be included in this height, depending on how they are classified. Spires and masts used as antennas are not generally included. The distinction between a low-rise and high-rise building is a matter of debate, but generally three stories or less is considered low-rise.

== History ==

There is clear evidence of homebuilding from around 18,000 BC. Buildings became common during the Neolithic period.

== Types ==

=== Residential ===
Single-family residential buildings are most often called &quot;houses&quot; or &quot;homes&quot;. Multi-family residential buildings containing more than one dwelling unit are called &quot;duplexes&quot; or &quot;apartment buildings&quot;. &quot;Condominiums&quot; are apartments that occupants own rather than rent. Houses may be built in pairs (semi-detached) or in terraces, where all but two of the houses have others on either side. Apartments may be built round courtyards or as rectangular blocks surrounded by plots of ground. Houses built as single dwellings may later be divided into apartments or bedsitters, or converted to other uses (e.g., offices or shops). Hotels, especially of the extended-stay variety (apartels), can be classed as residential.

Building types may range from huts to multimillion-dollar high-rise apartment blocks able to house thousands of people. Increasing settlement density in buildings (and smaller distances between buildings) is usually a response to high ground prices resulting from the desire of many people to live close to their places of employment or similar attractors.

Terms for residential buildings reflect such characteristics as &quot;function&quot; (e.g., holiday cottage (vacation home) or timeshare if occupied seasonally); &quot;size&quot; (cottage or great house); &quot;value&quot; (shack or mansion); &quot;manner of construction&quot; (log home or mobile home); &quot;architectural style&quot; (castle or Victorian); and &quot;proximity to geographical features&quot; (earth shelter, stilt house, houseboat, or floating home). For residents in need of special care, or those society considers dangerous enough to deprive of liberty, there are institutions (nursing homes, orphanages, psychiatric hospitals, and prisons) and group housing (barracks and dormitories).

Historically, many people lived in communal buildings called longhouses, smaller dwellings called pit-houses, and houses combined with barns, sometimes called housebarns.

Common building materials include brick, concrete, stone, and combinations thereof. Buildings are defined to be substantial, permanent structures. Such forms as yurts and motorhomes are therefore considered &quot;dwellings&quot; but not &quot;buildings&quot;.

===Commercial===
A commercial building is one in which at least one business is based and people do not live. Examples include stores, restaurant, and hotels.

===Industrial===
Industrial buildings are those in which heavy industry is done, such as manufacturing. These edifices include warehouses and factories.

===Agricultural===
Agricultural buildings are the outbuildings, such as barns located on farms.

=== Mixed use ===
Some buildings incorporate several or multiple different uses, most commonly commercial and residential.

=== Complex ===

Sometimes a group of inter-related (and possibly inter-connected) builds are referred to as a complex – for example a housing complex, educational complex, hospital complex, etc.

== Creation ==
The practice of designing, constructing, and operating buildings is most usually a collective effort of different groups of professionals and trades. Depending on the size, complexity, and purpose of a particular building project, the project team may include:

* A real estate developer who secures funding for the project;
* One or more financial institutions or other investors that provide the funding
* Local planning and code authorities
* A surveyor who performs an ALTA/ACSM and construction surveys throughout the project;
* Construction managers who coordinate the effort of different groups of project participants;
* Licensed architects and engineers who provide building design and prepare construction documents;
* The principal design Engineering disciplines which would normally include the following professionals: Civil, Structural, Mechanical building services or HVAC (heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning) Electrical Building Services, Plumbing and drainage. Also other possible design Engineer specialists may be involved such as Fire (prevention), Acoustic, façade engineers, building physics, Telecoms, AV (Audio Visual), BMS (Building Management Systems) Automatic controls etc. These design Engineers also prepare construction documents which are issued to specialist contractors to obtain a price for the works and to follow for the installations.
* Landscape architects;
* Interior designers;
* Other consultants;
* Contractors who provide construction services and install building systems such as climate control, electrical, plumbing, decoration, fire protection, security and telecommunications;
* Marketing or leasing agents;
* Facility managers who are responsible for operating the building.

Regardless of their size or intended use, all buildings in the US must comply with zoning ordinances, building codes and other regulations such as fire codes, life safety codes and related standards.

Vehicles—such as trailers, caravans, ships and passenger aircraft—are treated as &quot;buildings&quot; for life safety purposes.

=== Ownership and funding ===
* Mortgage loan
* Real estate developer

== Environmental impacts ==
== Building services ==

=== Physical plant ===
Any building requires a certain general amount of internal infrastructure to function, which includes such elements like heating / cooling, power and telecommunications, water and wastewater etc. Especially in commercial buildings (such as offices or factories), these can be extremely intricate systems taking up large amounts of space (sometimes located in separate areas or double floors / false ceilings) and constitute a big part of the regular maintenance required.

=== Conveying systems ===

Systems for transport of people within buildings:
* Escalator
* Moving sidewalk (horizontal and inclined)

Systems for transport of people between interconnected buildings:

* Skyway
* Underground city

== Building damage ==
Buildings may be damaged during construction or during maintenance. They may be damaged by accidents involving storms, explosions, subsidence caused by mining, water withdrawal or poor foundations and landslides. Buildings may suffer fire damage and flooding. They may become dilapidated through lack of proper maintenance, or alteration work improperly carried out.

<doc id="45998" wikidata="Q46397" url="?curid=45998" title="McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet">
<text>The McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet is an all-weather supersonic, twin-engine, carrier-capable, multirole combat aircraft, designed as both a fighter and attack aircraft (hence the F/A designation). Designed by McDonnell Douglas and Northrop, the F/A-18 was derived from the latter&#x27;s YF-17 in the 1970s for use by the United States Navy and Marine Corps. The Hornet is also used by the air forces of several other nations, and formerly by the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Flight Demonstration Squadron, the Blue Angels.

The F/A-18 was designed to be a highly versatile aircraft due to its avionics, cockpit displays, and excellent aerodynamic characteristics, with the ability to carry a wide variety of weapons. The aircraft can perform fighter escort, fleet air defense, suppression of enemy air defenses, air interdiction, close air support, and aerial reconnaissance. Its versatility and reliability have proven it to be a valuable carrier asset.

The Hornet entered operational service in 1983 and first saw combat action during the 1986 United States bombing of Libya and subsequently participated in the 1991 Gulf War and 2003 Iraq War. The F/A-18 Hornet served as the baseline for the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, its larger, evolutionary redesign, which supplanted both the older Hornet and the F-14 Tomcat in the U.S. Navy.

==Development==

===Origins===

The United States Navy started the Naval Fighter-Attack, Experimental (VFAX) program to procure a multirole aircraft to replace the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk, the A-7 Corsair II, and the remaining McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs, and to complement the Grumman F-14 Tomcat. Vice Admiral Kent Lee, then head of Naval Air Systems Command, was the lead advocate for the VFAX against strong opposition from many Navy officers, including Vice Admiral William D. Houser, deputy chief of naval operations for air warfare – the highest-ranking naval aviator.

In August 1973, Congress mandated that the Navy pursue a lower-cost alternative to the F-14. Grumman proposed a stripped F-14 designated the F-14X, while McDonnell Douglas proposed a naval variant of the F-15, but both were nearly as expensive as the F-14. That summer, Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger ordered the Navy to evaluate the competitors in the Air Force&#x27;s Lightweight Fighter (LWF) program, the General Dynamics YF-16 and Northrop YF-17. The Air Force competition specified a day fighter with no strike capability. In May 1974, the House Armed Services Committee redirected $34 million from the VFAX to a new program, the Navy Air Combat Fighter (NACF), intended to make maximum use of the technology developed for the LWF program.

===Redesigning the YF-17===
Though the YF-16 won the LWF competition, the Navy was skeptical that an aircraft with one engine and narrow landing gear could be easily or economically adapted to carrier service, and refused to adopt an F-16 derivative. On 2 May 1975, the Navy announced its selection of the YF-17. Since the LWF did not share the design requirements of the VFAX, the Navy asked McDonnell Douglas and Northrop to develop a new aircraft from the design and principles of the YF-17. On 1 March 1977, Secretary of the Navy W. Graham Claytor announced, that the F-18 would be named &quot;Hornet&quot;, after the characteristics of the Hornet insect. It also shares the namesake with ships that had borne the name since the Revolutionary War.
Northrop had partnered with McDonnell Douglas as a secondary contractor on NACF to capitalize on the latter&#x27;s experience in building carrier aircraft, including the widely used F-4 Phantom II. On the F-18, the two companies agreed to evenly split component manufacturing, with McDonnell Douglas conducting the final assembly. McDonnell Douglas would build the wings, stabilators, and forward fuselage; while Northrop would build the center and aft fuselage and vertical stabilizers. McDonnell Douglas was the prime contractor for the naval versions, and Northrop would be the prime contractor for the F-18L land-based version which Northrop hoped to sell on the export market.

The F-18, initially known as McDonnell Douglas Model 267, was drastically modified from the YF-17. For carrier operations, the airframe, undercarriage, and tailhook were strengthened, folding wings and catapult attachments were added, and the landing gear was widened. Another wheel was added to the front landing gear as well. To meet Navy range and reserves requirements, McDonnell increased fuel capacity by , by enlarging the dorsal spine and adding a 96-gallon fuel tank to each wing. A &quot;snag&quot; was added to the wing&#x27;s leading edge and stabilators to prevent an aeroelastic flutter discovered in the F-15 stabilator. The wings and stabilators were enlarged, the aft fuselage widened by , and the engines canted outward at the front. These changes added to the gross weight, bringing it to . The YF-17&#x27;s control system was replaced with a fully digital fly-by-wire system with quadruple redundancy, the first to be installed in a production fighter. The airframe was designed for a service life of 6,000 flight hours.
Originally, plans were to acquire a total of 780 aircraft of three variants: the single-seat F-18A fighter and A-18A attack aircraft, differing only in avionics, and the dual-seat TF-18A, which retained full mission capability of the F-18 with a reduced fuel load. Following improvements in avionics and multifunction displays, and a redesign of external stores stations, the A-18A and F-18A were able to be combined into one aircraft. Starting in 1980, the aircraft began to be referred to as the F/A-18A, and the designation was officially announced on 1 April 1984. The TF-18A was redesignated F/A-18B.

=== Northrop&#x27;s F-18L ===
Northrop developed the F-18L as a potential export aircraft. Since it was not strengthened for carrier service, it was expected to be lighter and better performing, and a strong competitor to the F-16 Fighting Falcon then being offered to American allies. The F-18L&#x27;s normal gross weight was lighter than the F/A-18A by , via lighter landing gear, lack of wing folding mechanism, reduced part thickness in areas, and lower fuel-carrying capacity. Though the aircraft retained a lightened tailhook, the most obvious external difference was the removal of &quot;snags&quot; on the leading edge of the wings and stabilators. It still retained 71% commonality with the F/A-18 by parts weight, and 90% of the high-value systems, including the avionics, radar, and electronic countermeasure suite, though alternatives were offered. Unlike the F/A-18, the F-18L carried no fuel in its wings and lacked weapons stations on the intakes. It had three underwing pylons on each side, instead.

The F/A-18L version followed to coincide with the U.S. Navy&#x27;s F/A-18A as a land-based export alternative. This was essentially an F/A-18A lightened by about ; weight was reduced by removing the folding wing and associated actuators, implementing a simpler landing gear (single wheel nose gear and cantilever oleo main gear), and changing to a land-based tail hook. The revised F/A-18L included wing fuel tanks and fuselage stations of the F/A-18A. Its weapons capacity would increase from , largely due to the addition of a third underwing pylon and strengthened wingtips (11 stations in total vs 9 stations of the F/A-18A). Compared to the F-18L, the outboard weapons pylons are closer to the wingtip missile rails. Because of the strengthened nonfolding wing, the wingtip missile rails were designed to carry either the AIM-7 Sparrow or Skyflash medium-range air-to-air missiles, in addition to the AIM-9 Sidewinder as found on the F/A-18A. The F/A-18L was strengthened for a 9 g design load factor compared to the F/A-18A&#x27;s 7.5 g factor.

The partnership between McDonnell Douglas and Northrop soured over competition for foreign sales for the two models. Northrop felt that McDonnell Douglas would put the F/A-18 in direct competition with the F-18L. In October 1979, Northrop filed a series of lawsuits charging that McDonnell was using Northrop technology developed for the F-18L for foreign sales of the F/A-18 in violation of their agreement, and asked for a moratorium on foreign sales of the Hornet. McDonnell Douglas countersued, alleging Northrop illegally used F/A-18 technology in its F-20 Tigershark. A settlement was announced 8 April 1985 for all of the lawsuits. McDonnell Douglas paid Northrop $50 million for &quot;rights to sell the F/A-18 wherever it could&quot;. Additionally, the companies agreed on McDonnell Douglas as the prime contractor with Northrop as the principal subcontractor. As principal subcontractor, Northrop produced the rear section for the F/A-18 (A/B/C/D/E/F), while McDonnell Douglas produced the rest with final assembly performed by McDonnell Douglas. At the time of the settlement, Northrop had ceased work on the F-18L. Most export orders for the F-18L were captured by the F-16 or the F/A-18. The F-20 Tigershark did not enter production, and although the program was not officially terminated until 17 November 1986, it was dead by mid-1985.

===Into production===
During flight testing, the snag on the leading edge of the stabilators was filled in, and the gap between the leading-edge extensions (LEX) and the fuselage was mostly filled in. The gaps, called the boundary layer air discharge slots, controlled the vortices generated by the LEX and presented clean air to the vertical stabilizers at high angles of attack, but they also generated a great deal of parasitic drag, worsening the problem of the F/A-18&#x27;s inadequate range. McDonnell filled in 80% of the gap, leaving a small slot to bleed air from the engine intake. This may have contributed to early problems with fatigue cracks appearing on the vertical stabilizers due to extreme structural loads, resulting in a short grounding in 1984 until the stabilizers were strengthened. Starting in May 1988, a small vertical fence was added to the top of each LEX to broaden the vortices and direct them away from the vertical stabilizers. This also provided a minor increase in controllability as a side effect. F/A-18s of early versions had a problem with insufficient rate of roll, exacerbated by the insufficient wing stiffness, especially with heavy underwing ordnance loads. The first production F/A-18A flew on 12 April 1980. After a production run of 380 F/A-18As (including the nine assigned to flight systems development), manufacture shifted to the F/A-18C in September 1987.

===Improvements and design changes===
In the 1990s, the U.S. Navy faced the need to replace its aging A-6 Intruders and A-7 Corsair IIs with no replacement in development. To answer this deficiency, the Navy commissioned development of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. Despite its designation, it is not just an upgrade of the F/A-18 Hornet, but rather, a new, larger airframe using the design concepts of the Hornet. Hornets and Super Hornets will serve complementary roles in the U.S. Navy carrier fleet until the Hornet A-D models are completely replaced by the F-35C Lightning II. Although the airframe was originally designed for service life of 6,000 flight hours, the Marines have chosen to extend the use of certain F/A-18s up to 10,000 flight hours, due to delays in the F-35B variant.

==Design==
The F/A-18 is a twin engine, midwing, multimission tactical aircraft. It is highly maneuverable, due to its good thrust-to-weight ratio, digital fly-by-wire control system, and leading-edge extensions, which allow the Hornet to remain controllable at high angles of attack. The trapezoidal wing has a 20-degree sweepback on the leading edge and a straight trailing edge. The wing has full-span, leading-edge flaps and the trailing edge has single-slotted flaps and ailerons over the entire span.

Canted vertical stabilizers are another distinguishing design element, one among several other such elements that enable the Hornet&#x27;s excellent high angle of attack ability, including oversized horizontal stabilators, oversized trailing-edge flaps that operate as flaperons, large full-length leading-edge slats, and flight control computer programming that multiplies the movement of each control surface at low speeds and moves the vertical rudders inboard instead of simply left and right. The Hornet&#x27;s normally high angle of attack performance envelope was put to rigorous testing and enhanced in the NASA F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV). NASA used the F-18 HARV to demonstrate flight handling characteristics at high angle-of-attack (alpha) of 65–70 degrees using thrust vectoring vanes. F/A-18 stabilators were also used as canards on NASA&#x27;s F-15S/MTD.
The Hornet was among the first aircraft to heavily use multifunction displays, which at the switch of a button allow a pilot to perform either fighter or attack roles or both. This &quot;force multiplier&quot; ability gives the operational commander more flexibility to employ tactical aircraft in a fast-changing battle scenario. It was the first Navy aircraft to incorporate a digital multiplexing avionics bus, enabling easy upgrades.
The Hornet was designed to reduce maintenance, and as a result, has required far less downtime than its heavier counterparts, the F-14 Tomcat and the A-6 Intruder. Its mean time between failures is three times greater than any other Navy strike aircraft, and requires half the maintenance time. Its General Electric F404 engines were also innovative in that they were designed with operability, reliability, and maintainability first. The engine, while unexceptional in rated performance, demonstrates exceptional robustness under various conditions and is resistant to stall and flameout. The F404 engine connects to the airframe at only 10 points and can be replaced without special equipment: a four-person team can remove the engine within 20 minutes. The aircraft has a top speed of Mach 1.8 at 40,000 ft.

The engine air inlets of the Hornet, like that of the F-16, are of a simpler &quot;fixed&quot; design, while those of the F-4, F-14, and F-15 have variable geometry or variable intake ramp air inlets.

A 1989 USMC study found that single-seat fighters were well suited to air-to-air combat missions, while dual-seat fighters were favored for complex strike missions against heavy air and ground defenses in adverse weather—the question being not so much as to whether a second pair of eyes would be useful, but as to having the second crewman sit in the same fighter or in a second fighter. Single-seat fighters that lacked wingmen were shown to be especially vulnerable.

==Operational history==
===United States===
====Entry into service====
McDonnell Douglas rolled out the first F/A-18A on 13 September 1978, in blue-on-white colors marked with &quot;Navy&quot; on the left and &quot;Marines&quot; on the right. Its first flight was on 18 November. In a break with tradition, the Navy pioneered the &quot;principal site concept&quot; with the F/A-18, where almost all testing was done at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, instead of near the site of manufacture, and using Navy and Marine Corps test pilots instead of civilians early in development. In March 1979, Lt. Cdr. John Padgett became the first Navy pilot to fly the F/A-18.

Following trials and operational testing by VX-4 and VX-5, Hornets began to fill the Fleet Replacement Squadrons VFA-125, VFA-106, and VMFAT-101, where pilots are introduced to the F/A-18. The Hornet entered operational service with Marine Corps squadron VMFA-314 at MCAS El Toro on 7 January 1983, and with Navy squadrons VFA-113 and VFA-25 on 1 July 1984, replacing F-4s and A-7Es, respectively.

Navy strike-fighter squadrons VFA-25 and VFA-113 (assigned to CVW-14) deployed aboard from February to August 1985, marking the first deployment for the F/A-18.

The initial fleet reports were complimentary, indicating that the Hornet was extraordinarily reliable, a major change from its predecessor, the F-4J. In January 1985, the VFA-131 &quot;Wildcats&quot; and the VFA-132 &quot;Privateers&quot; moved from Naval Air Station Lemoore, California to Naval Air Station Cecil Field, Florida to become the Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s first F/A-18 squadrons. VFA-151, VFA-161, VFA-192 and VFA-195 transitioned to the F/A-18A in 1986. With the exception of VFA-161, the rest would move to NAF Atsugi, Japan to join CVW-5 and the USS &quot;Midway&quot;. Other squadrons that switched to F/A-18 included VFA-146 &quot;Blue Diamonds&quot;, and VFA-147 &quot;Argonauts&quot;.
The U.S. Navy&#x27;s Blue Angels Flight Demonstration Squadron switched to the F/A-18 Hornet in 1986, replacing the A-4 Skyhawk. The Blue Angels performed in F/A-18A, B, C, and D models at air shows and other special events across the US and worldwide before transitioning to the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet in late 2020. Blue Angels pilots must have 1,250 hours and an aircraft-carrier certification. The two-seat B and D models were typically used to give rides to VIPs, but also filled in for other aircraft, if such a need arose.

NASA operates several F/A-18 aircraft for research purposes and also as chase aircraft; these F/A-18s are based at the Armstrong Flight Research Center (formerly the Dryden Flight Research Center) in California. NASA received three two-seat F/A-18B aircraft in 2018. On 21 September 2012, two NASA F/A-18s escorted a NASA Boeing 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft carrying the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; over portions of California to Los Angeles International Airport before being delivered to the California Science Center museum in Los Angeles.

====Combat operations====
The F/A-18 first saw combat action in April 1986, when VFA-131, VFA-132, VMFA-314, and VMFA-323 Hornets from flew Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) missions against Libyan air defenses during Operation Prairie Fire and an attack on Benghazi as part of Operation El Dorado Canyon.

During the Gulf War of 1991, the Navy deployed 106 F/A-18A/C Hornets and Marine Corps deployed 84 F/A-18A/C/D Hornets. F/A-18 pilots were credited with two kills during the Gulf War, both MiG-21s. On 17 January, the first day of the war, U.S. Navy pilots Lieutenant Commander Mark I. Fox and, Lieutenant Nick Mongilio were in a flight of four Hornets when they were sent from in the Red Sea to bomb airfield H-3 in southwestern Iraq. While en route, they were warned by an E-2C of approaching &quot;Bandits&quot; or Iraqi MiG-21 aircraft. The Hornets shot down the two MiGs with AIM-7 and AIM-9 missiles in a brief dogfight. It took 40 seconds from when the bandits appeared on the radar of the E-2 until both aircraft were shot down. The F/A-18s, each carrying four bombs, then resumed their bombing run before returning to &quot;Saratoga&quot;.
The Hornet&#x27;s survivability was demonstrated when a Hornet took hits in both engines and flew back to base. It was repaired and flying within a few days. F/A-18s flew 4,551 sorties with 10 Hornets damaged including three losses, one confirmed lost to enemy fire. All three losses were U.S. Navy F/A-18s, with two of their pilots lost. On 17 January 1991, Lieutenant Commander Scott Speicher of VFA-81 was shot down and killed in the crash of his aircraft. An unclassified summary of a 2001 CIA report suggests that Speicher&#x27;s aircraft was shot down by a missile fired from an Iraqi Air Force aircraft, most likely a MiG-25.

On 24 January 1991, F/A-18A bureau number 163121, from , piloted by Lt H.E. Overs, was lost due to an engine failure or loss of control over the Persian Gulf. The pilot ejected and was recovered by .&lt;ref name=&quot;The Air Forces Book of the F/A-18 Hornet, 2003&quot;&gt;&quot;The Air Forces Book of the F/A-18 Hornet&quot;, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 February 1991, F/A-18A bureau number 163096, piloted by Lieutenant Robert Dwyer was lost over the North Persian Gulf after a successful mission to Iraq; he was officially listed as killed in action, body not recovered.

As the A-6 Intruder was retired in the 1990s, its role was filled by the F/A-18. The F/A-18 demonstrated its versatility and reliability during Operation Desert Storm, shooting down enemy fighters and subsequently bombing enemy targets with the same aircraft on the same mission. It broke records for tactical aircraft in availability, reliability, and maintainability.

Both U.S. Navy F/A-18A/C models and Marine F/A-18A/C/D models were used continuously in Operation Southern Watch and over Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s. U.S. Navy Hornets flew during Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001 from carriers operating in the North Arabian Sea. Both the F/A-18A/C and newer F/A-18E/F variants were used during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, operating from aircraft carriers as well from an air base in Kuwait. Later in the conflict USMC A+, C, and primarily D models operated from bases within Iraq.

An F/A-18C was accidentally downed in a friendly fire incident by a Patriot missile when a pilot tried to evade two missiles fired at his plane and crashed. Two others collided over Iraq in May 2005.

As of 2017, the USMC plans to use the F/A-18 until the early 2030s.

The last operational deployment of the F/A-18C Hornet in U.S. Navy service was aboard the and ended on 12 March 2018. The aircraft briefly went back to sea for routine carrier qualifications in October, but it was retired from active Navy service on 1 February 2019. The type continued to be used by reserve units, primarily for adversary training. The actual final Navy F/A-18C operational flight occurred on 2 October 2019.

===Non-U.S. service===
The F/A-18 has been purchased and is in operation with several foreign air services. Export Hornets are typically similar to U.S. models of a similar manufacture date. Since none of the customers operate aircraft carriers, all export models have been sold without the automatic carrier landing system, and the Royal Australian Air Force further removed the catapult attachment on the nose gear. Except for Canada, all export customers purchased their Hornets through the U.S. Navy, via the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program, where the Navy acts as the purchasing manager, but incurs no financial gain or loss. Canada is the largest Hornet operator outside of the U.S.

====Australia====

The Royal Australian Air Force purchased 57 F/A-18A fighters and 18 F/A-18B two-seat trainers to replace its Dassault Mirage IIIOs. Numerous options were considered for the replacement, notably the F-15A Eagle, the F-16 Fighting Falcon, and the then new F/A-18 Hornet. The F-15 was discounted because the version offered had no ground-attack capability. The F-16 was considered unsuitable largely due to having only one engine. Australia selected the F/A-18 in October 1981. Original differences between the Australian and U.S. Navy&#x27;s standard F/A-18 were the removed nose-wheel tie bar for catapult launch (later re-fitted with a dummy version to remove nose wheel shimmy), addition of a high frequency radio, an Australian fatigue data analysis system, an improved video and voice recorder, and the use of instrument landing system/VHF omnidirectional range instead of the carrier landing system.

The first two aircraft were produced in the US, with the remainder assembled in Australia at Government Aircraft Factories. F/A-18 deliveries to the RAAF began on 29 October 1984, and continued until May 1990. In 2001, Australia deployed four aircraft to Diego Garcia, in an air-defense role, during coalition operations against the Taliban in Afghanistan. In 2003, 75 Squadron deployed 14 F/A-18s to Qatar as part of Operation Falconer and these aircraft saw action during the invasion of Iraq. Australia had 71 Hornets in service in 2006, after four were lost to crashes.

The fleet was upgraded beginning in the late 1990s to extend their service lives to 2015. They were expected to be retired then and replaced by the F-35 Lightning II. Several of the Australian Hornets subsequently had refits applied to extend their service lives out further to a new planned retirement date of 2020. Australia has also purchased 24 F/A-18F Super Hornets, with deliveries beginning in 2010.

In March 2015, six F/A-18As from No. 75 Squadron were deployed to the Middle East as part of Operation Okra, replacing a detachment of Super Hornets.

Australia has sold 25 F/A-18A/Bs to Canada with first two delivered to RCAF in February 2019. By 2021, 12 (A)F/A-18A and 6 (A)F/A-18B (and an additional 7 disassembled (A)F/A-18 for spare parts) were sold to the RCAF.

At Wings Over Illawarra 2021, the Hornet performed its last public flying display before retirement. Australia formally retired the Hornet at RAAF Base Williamtown on 29 November 2021. On 30 November 2021, No. 75 Squadron RAAF flew 7 of the last Hornets from RAAF Base Tindal to RAAF Base Williamtown. On 3 December 2021, the last Hornet left RAAF Base Tindal for decommissioning. Due to inclement weather, the Hornet diverted to RAAF Base Townsville and concluded the final RAAF Hornet flight to RAAF Base Williamtown on 4 December 2021.

====Canada====

Canada was the first export customer for the Hornet, replacing the Canadair CF-104 Starfighter (air reconnaissance and strike), the McDonnell CF-101 Voodoo (air interception) and the Canadair CF-116 Freedom Fighter (ground attack). The Canadian Forces Air Command ordered 98 A models (Canadian designation CF-188A/CF-18A) and 40 B models (designation CF-188B/CF-18B). The original CF-18 as delivered was nearly identical to the F/A-18A and B models. Many features that made the F/A-18 suitable for naval carrier operations were retained by the Canadian Forces, such as the robust landing gear, the arrestor hook, and wing folding mechanisms.

In 1991, Canada committed 26 CF-18s to the Gulf War, based in Qatar. These aircraft primarily provided Combat Air Patrol duties, although, late in the air war, began to perform air strikes on Iraqi ground targets. On 30 January 1991, two CF-18s on CAP detected and attacked an Iraqi TNC-45 patrol boat. The vessel was repeatedly strafed and damaged by 20mm cannon fire, but an attempt to sink the ship with an air-to-air missile failed. The ship was subsequently sunk by American aircraft, but the Canadian CF-18s received partial credit for its destruction.

In June 1999, 18 CF-18s were deployed to Aviano AB, Italy, where they participated in both the air-to-ground and air-to-air roles in the former Yugoslavia.

62 CF-18A and 18 CF-18B aircraft took part in the Incremental Modernization Project which was completed in two phases. The program was launched in 2001 and the last updated aircraft was delivered in March 2010. The aims were to improve air-to-air and air-to-ground combat abilities, upgrade sensors and the defensive suite, and replace the datalinks and communications systems on board the CF-18 from the F/A-18A and F/A-18B standard to the current F/A-18C and F/A-18D standard.

In July 2010 the Canadian government announced plans to replace the remaining CF-18 fleet with 65 F-35 Lightning IIs, with deliveries scheduled to start in 2016. In November 2016, Canada announced plans to buy 18 Super Hornets as an interim solution while reviewing its F-35 order. The plan for Super Hornets was later, in October 2017, put on hold due to a trade conflict with the U.S. over the Bombardier C-Series. Instead, Canada was seeking to purchase surplus Hornets from Australia or Kuwait. Canada has since acquired 25 ex-Australian F/A-18A/Bs, the first two of which were delivered in February 2019. 18 of these airframes will be introduced into active service with the remaining 7 to be used for spare parts and testing.

====Finland====
The Finnish Air Force ordered 64 F-18C/Ds (57 C models, seven D models) in 1992. The F-18Ds were built at St. Louis, while the F-18Cs were locally assembled in Finland. Delivery of the aircraft started in November 1995 and ended in August 2000. The Hornet replaced the MiG-21bis and Saab 35 Draken in Finnish service. The Finnish Hornets were initially to be used only for air defense, hence the F-18 designation. The F-18C includes the ASPJ (Airborne Self-Protection Jammer) jamming pod ALQ-165. The U.S. Navy later included the ALQ-165 on their F/A-18E/F Super Hornet procurement.

One Hornet was destroyed in a mid-air collision in 2001. A damaged F-18C, nicknamed &quot;Frankenhornet&quot;, was rebuilt into a F-18D using the forward section of a Canadian CF-18B that was purchased. The modified fighter crashed during a test flight in January 2010, due to a faulty tailplane servo cylinder.

The Finnish Air Force&#x27;s Hornet fleet went through a two-stage Mid-Life Upgrade (MLU) program. From 2006 to 2010, the MLU 1 stage was aimed at improving the aircraft&#x27;s air-to-air capabilities. It included the integration of the new AIM-9X Sidewinder missile together with the JHMCS helmet-mounted sight, new radios, a new IFF interrogator, and a new moving map display. Then, from 2012 to 2016, the MLU 2 stage was mainly focused at enabling the aircraft to use standoff air-to-ground weapons, including the JDAM, JSOW and JASSM. The Hornets also received the Litening targeting pod. New chaff/flare dispensers were installed. The cockpit was modernized, and Link 16 was added. The upgrade also includes the procurement and integration of a new version of the AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missile. In total, 62 aircraft (the whole Finnish Hornet fleet as of 2016) were modernized to MLU 2 standards. Since this upgrade gave the plane a ground-attack capability, the Finnish Air Force also started to refer to the plane as &quot;F/A-18&quot; rather than just &quot;F-18&quot;.

With a service life of 30 years, the Hornets are to remain in active service until 2025–2030. In October 2014, the Finnish national broadcaster Yle announced that consideration was being given to the replacement of the Hornet. In 2015, Finland started the HX Fighter Program that aims to acquire new multirole fighters to replace the current Hornet fleet. On 10 December 2021, the Finnish government announced the selection of Lockheed Martin&#x27;s fifth-generation F-35A Lightning II for its HX Fighter Program.

====Kuwait====
The Kuwait Air Force (&quot;Al Quwwat Aj Jawwaiya Al Kuwaitiya&quot;) ordered 32 F/A-18C and eight F/A-18D Hornets in 1988. Delivery started in October 1991 until August 1993. The F/A-18C/Ds replaced A-4KU Skyhawk. Kuwait Air Force Hornets have flown missions over Iraq during Operation Southern Watch in the 1990s. They have also participated in military exercises with the air forces of other Gulf nations. Kuwait had 39 F/A-18C/D Hornets in service in 2008. Kuwait also participated in the Yemeni Civil War (2015–present). In February 2017, the Commander of the Kuwait Air Force revealed that the F/A-18s based at King Khalid Air Base had performed approximately 3,000 sorties over Yemen.

====Malaysia====
The Royal Malaysian Air Force (&quot;Tentera Udara Diraja Malaysia&quot;) has eight F/A-18Ds. Delivery of the aircraft occurred from March to August 1997.

Three Hornets together with five UK-made BAE Hawk 208 were deployed in a bombing airstrike on the &quot;Royal Security Forces of the Sultanate of Sulu and North Borneo&quot; terrorists on 5 March 2013, just before the joint forces of the Malaysian Army and Royal Malaysia Police commandos launched an all-out assault during Operation Daulat. The Hornets were tasked with close air support to the no-fly zone in Lahad Datu, Sabah.

====Spain====
The Spanish Air and Space Force (&quot;Ejército del Aire y del Espacio&quot;) ordered 60 EF-18A model and 12 EF-18B model Hornets (the &quot;E&quot; standing for &quot;España&quot;, Spain), named respectively as C.15 and CE.15 by Spain. The Spanish version was delivered from 22 November 1985 to July 1990. These fighters were upgraded to F-18A+/B+ standard, close to F/A-18C/D (plus version includes later mission and armament computers, databuses, data-storage set, new wiring, pylon modifications and software, new abilities as AN/AAS-38B NITE Hawk targeting FLIR pods).

In 1995 Spain obtained 24 ex-USN F/A-18A Hornets, with six more on option. These were delivered from December 1995 until December 1998. Before delivery, they were modified to EF-18A+ standard. This was the first sale of USN surplus Hornets.

Spanish Hornets operate as an all-weather interceptor 60% of the time and as an all-weather day/night attack aircraft for the remainder. In case of war, each of the frontline squadrons would take a primary role: 121 is tasked with tactical air support and maritime operations; 151 and 122 are assigned to all-weather interception and air combat roles; and 152 is assigned the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) mission. Air refueling is provided by KC-130Hs and Boeing 707TTs. Pilot conversion to EF-18 is centralized in 153 Squadron (Ala 15). Squadron 462&#x27;s role is air defense of the Canary Islands, being responsible for fighter and attack missions from Gando AB.

Spanish Air Force EF-18 Hornets have flown Ground Attack, SEAD, combat air patrol (CAP) combat missions in Bosnia and Kosovo, under NATO command, in Aviano detachment (Italy). They shared the base with Canadian and USMC F/A-18s. Six Spanish Hornets had been lost in accidents by 2003. On 25 May 1995, while taking part of Operation Deny Flight, Spanish EF-18s armed with laser-guided bombs and supported by US F-16s destroyed an ammunition depot at Pale, a Bosnian Serb stronghold in the outskirts of Sarajevo.

Over Yugoslavia, eight EF-18s, based at Aviano AB, participated in bombing raids in Operation Allied Force in 1999, being among the first planes to strike Yugoslav targets. Over Bosnia, they also performed missions for air-to-air combat air patrol, close air support air-to-ground, photo reconnaissance, forward air controller-airborne, and tactical air controller-airborne. Over Libya, four Spanish Hornets participated in enforcing a no-fly zone.

====Switzerland====
The Swiss Air Force purchased 26 C models and eight D models, they were delivered from January 1996 to December 1999. Three D models and one C model had been lost in crashes as of 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.lw.admin.ch/&quot;&gt;&quot;Boeing F/A-18 Hornet&quot; &quot;lw.admin.ch,&quot; 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 October 2015, an F/A-18D crashed in France during training with two Swiss Air Force Northrop F-5s in the Swiss/French training area EURAC25; the pilot ejected safely.

During late 2007, Switzerland requested to be included in the F/A-18C/D Upgrade 25 Program, to extend the useful life of its F/A-18C/Ds. The program includes significant upgrades to the avionics and mission computer, 12 ATFLIR surveillance and targeting pods, and 44 sets of AN/ALR-67v3 ECM equipment. In October 2008, the Swiss Hornet fleet reached the 50,000 flight hour milestone.
The Swiss Air Force has also taken delivery of two F/A-18C full-scale mock-ups for use as ground crew interactive training simulators. Locally built by Hugo Wolf AG, they are externally accurate copies and have been registered as Boeing F/A-18C (Hugo Wolf) aircraft with tail numbers X-5098 and X-5099. These include a complex equipment fit, including many original cockpit components and instruments, allowing the simulation of fires, fuel leaks, nosewheel collapse and other emergency scenarios. X-5098 is permanently stationed at Payerne Air Base while X-5099, the first one built, is moved between air bases according to training demands.

=== Potential operators ===
The F/A-18C and F/A-18D were considered by the French Navy (&quot;Marine Nationale&quot;) during the 1980s for deployment on their aircraft carriers &quot;Clemenceau&quot; and &quot;Foch&quot; and again in the 1990s for the later nuclear-powered &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;, in the event that the Dassault Rafale M was not brought into service when originally planned.

Austria, Chile, Czech Republic, Hungary, Philippines, Poland, and Singapore evaluated the Hornet but did not purchase it. Thailand ordered four C and four D model Hornets but the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s resulted in the order being canceled. The Hornets were completed as F/A-18Ds for the U.S. Marine Corps.

The F/A-18A and F-18L land-based version competed for a fighter contract from Greece in the 1980s. The Greek government chose F-16 and Mirage 2000 instead.

In June 2023, the &quot;Financial Review&quot; reported that Australia, the United States and Ukraine were negotiating the supply of 41 Australian F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets to the Ukrainian Air Force. A further update was issued in December 2023, that the U.S. have continued talks with the Australian government and have begun exploring the option of providing aging jets and parts from the Finnish Air Force.

During December 2023 Ukraine asked the US, according to documents viewed by Reuters, for F/A-18 Hornets. The Ukrainian ambassador to Australia is expected to again request surplus Hornets. A report found that 14 of the 41 airframes were airworthy and another two years flying could be &quot;squeezed&quot; from them.

As of July 2024, Malaysia intends to acquire Kuwaiti legacy F/A-18s as the Kuwaiti Air Force replaces their Hornets with newer Super Hornet and Eurofighter Typhoon.

==Variants==
===F/A-18A/B Hornet===
The &quot;F/A-18A,&quot; single-seat variant, can employ the AGM-84 Harpoon, AGM-65E Maverick, AGM-88 HARM and the AGM-62 Walleye I/II. The F/A-18A was also equipped with the AN/AAS-38 Nite Hawk targeting pod and the AN/ASQ-173 laser spot tracker for targeting. During the Gulf War, there were limited numbers of the Nite hawk for USN and USMC Hornets. The &quot;F/A-18B&quot; has space for the two-seat cockpit, provided by a relocation of avionics equipment and a 6% reduction in internal fuel. Two-seat Hornets are otherwise fully combat-capable. The B-model is used primarily for training.

In 1992, the original Hughes AN/APG-65 radar was replaced with the Hughes (now Raytheon) AN/APG-73, a faster and more capable radar. A-model Hornets that have been upgraded to the AN/APG-73 and are capable of carrying the AIM-120 AMRAAM are designated &quot;F/A-18A+&quot;.

=== F/A-18C/D Hornet ===
The F/A-18C and D models are the result of a block upgrade in 1987 incorporating upgraded radar, avionics, and the capacity to carry new missiles such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missile and later on the AGM-84E SLAM as well as the IR version of the AGM-65 (AGM-65F). Other upgrades include the Martin-Baker NACES (Navy Aircrew Common ejection seat), and a self-protection jammer. A synthetic aperture ground mapping radar enables the pilot to locate targets in poor visibility conditions. C and D models delivered since 1989 also have improved night attack abilities, consisting of the Hughes AN/AAR-50 thermal navigation pod, AN/AAS-38A NITE Hawk FLIR (forward looking infrared array) targeting pod, night vision goggles, and two full-color (formerly monochrome) multi-function display (MFDs) and a color moving map.

The &quot;F/A-18C&quot; is the single-seat variant and the &quot;F/A-18D&quot; is the two-seat variant. The D-model can be configured for training or as an all-weather strike craft. The &quot;missionized&quot; D model&#x27;s rear seat is configured for a Marine Corps naval flight officer who functions as a Weapons and Sensors Officer to assist in operating the weapons systems. The F/A-18D is primarily operated by the U.S. Marine Corps in the night attack and Forward Air Controller (Airborne) (FAC(A)) roles.
Sixty D-model Hornets are configured as the night attack &quot;F/A-18D (RC)&quot; with ability for reconnaissance. These could be outfitted with the ATARS electro-optical sensor package that includes a sensor pod and equipment mounted in the place of the M61 cannon.

Beginning in 1992, the F404-GE-402 enhanced performance engine, providing approximately 10% more maximum static thrust became the standard Hornet engine. Since 1993, the AAS-38A NITE Hawk added a designator/ranger laser, allowing it to self-mark targets. The later AAS-38B added the ability to strike targets designated by lasers from other aircraft.

Production of the C- and D- models ended in 2000. The last F/A-18C was assembled in Finland and delivered to the Finnish Air Force in August 2000. The last F/A-18D was delivered to the U.S. Marine Corps in August 2000.

The U.S. Navy retired its F/A-18C/D in February 2019. However, the USMC still retains theirs, and is in the process of upgrading their radar to APG-79(V)4 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar system.

===F/A-18E/F Super Hornet===

The single-seat &quot;F/A-18E&quot; and two-seat &quot;F/A-18F&quot;, both officially named &quot;Super Hornet&quot;, carry over the name and design concept of the original F/A-18 but have been extensively redesigned by McDonnell Douglas. The Super Hornet, which began production in 1995, has a new, 25% larger airframe, larger rectangular air intakes, more powerful GE F414 engines based on F/A-18&#x27;s F404, and an upgraded avionics suite. Like the Marine Corps&#x27; F/A-18D, the Navy&#x27;s F/A-18F carries a naval flight officer as a second crew member in a weapon systems officer (WSO) role. The Super Hornet is unofficially known as &quot;Rhino&quot; in operational use. This name was chosen to distinguish the newer variants from the legacy F-18A/B/C/D Hornet and avoid confusion during carrier deck operations. The Super Hornet is also operated by Australia and Kuwait.

===EA-18G Growler===

The EA-18G Growler is an electronic warfare version of the two-seat F/A-18F, which entered production in 2007. The Growler has replaced the Navy&#x27;s EA-6B Prowler and carries a Naval Flight Officer as a second crewman in an Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) role.

===US variants list===
;F/A-18A: Original single-seat version, can carry the AGM-84 ASM, AGM-62 Walleye, AGM-88 HARM and the TV guided versions AGM-65 Maverick.
;F/A-18B: Two-seat version of the F/A-18A, combat capable but mainly used for training.
;F/A-18C: Improved version of the F/A-18A, can carry the AIM-120 AMRAAM, AGM-84E SLAM and the IR guided versions AGM-65 Maverick.
;F/A-18D: Two-seat version of the F/A-18C, used only by USMC.
;F-18(R): This was a proposed reconnaissance version of the F/A-18A. It included a sensor package that replaced the 20 mm cannon. The first of two prototypes flew in August 1984. Small numbers were produced.
;RF-18D: Proposed two-seat reconnaissance version for the U.S. Marine Corps in the mid-1980s. It was to carry a radar reconnaissance pod. The system was canceled after it was unfunded in 1988. This ability was later realized on the F/A-18D(RC).
;TF-18A: Two-seat training version of the F/A-18A fighter, later redesignated &quot;F/A-18B&quot;.
;F-18 HARV: Single-seat High Alpha Research Vehicle for NASA. High angles of attack using thrust vectoring, modifications to the flight controls, and forebody strakes

;X-53 Active Aeroelastic Wing: A NASA F/A-18 has been modified to demonstrate the Active Aeroelastic Wing technology, and was designated &quot;X-53&quot; in December 2006.

===Export variants===
&quot;These designations are not part of 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system.&quot;

;F-18L: A proposed land-based export version of the single-seat F-18A with air-superiority and attack capabilities. This variant was to be lightened by the removal of carrier landing capability and assembled by Northrop. Customers preferred the standard Hornet and the F-18L never entered mass production.

;(A)F/A-18A/B
* (A)F/A-18A: Single-seat fighter/attack version for the Royal Australian Air Force.
* (A)F/A-18B: Two-seat training version for the Royal Australian Air Force.
:&quot;F/A-18A&quot; was the original company designation, designations of &quot;AF-18A&quot; &amp; &quot;ATF-18A&quot; have also been applied. Assembled in Australia (excluding the first two (A)F/A-18Bs) by Aero-Space Technologies of Australia (ASTA) from 1985 through to 1990, from kits produced by McDonnell Douglas with increasing local content in the later aircraft. Originally the most notable differences between an Australian (A)F/A-18A/B and a US F/A-18A/B were the lack of a catapult attachment, replacing the carrier tailhook with a lighter land arresting hook, and the automatic carrier landing system with an Instrument Landing System. Australian Hornets have been involved in several major upgrade programs. This program called HUG (Hornet Upgrade) has had a few evolutions over the years. The first was to give Australian Hornets F/A-18C model avionics. The second and current upgrade program (HUG 2.2) updates the fleet&#x27;s avionics even further. By 2021 12 (A)F/A-18A and 6 (A)F/A-18B (and an additional 7 broken down (A)F/A-18 for spare parts) were sold to the Royal Canadian Air Force.

;CF-188
* CF-188A: Single-seat fighter/attack version for the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF)/Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Unofficially referred to as the CF-18A Hornet.
* CF-188B: Two-seat training and combat version for the CAF/RCAF. Unofficially referred to as the CF-18B Hornet.

;EF-18 Hornet
* EF-18A: Single-seat fighter/attack version for the Spanish Air and Space Force, the E is for &quot;España&quot; (Spain in Spanish). The Spanish Air and Space Force designation is C.15, the C being for &quot;Caza&quot; (fighter aircraft in Spanish, lit. hunt). They were first upgraded to the EF-18A+ version in 1992, this included the pylons in the F/A-18C standard. The Spanish Air a Force did not acquire licenses, but locally developed upgrades. From 2004 to 2013 they were locally upgraded by EADS CASA and Indra Sistemas in the Mid-life Upgrade (MLU) program, with better avionics, data buses, TPAC, data presentation (similar to the F/A-18C Hornet), navigation, communications (radios), software and ECM suit. The AN/APG-65 radar was upgraded to the V3 version and the aircraft also received the AL-400 Radar Warning Receiver and the ASQ-600 emission detector and were certified to operate with Iris-T, GBU-48 and Taurus. This also included a thorough structural and engine revision and overhaul, and a new paint job for a few units. This version is locally known as EF-18MLU/C.15M.
* EF-18B: Two-seat training version for the Spanish Air and Space Force. The Spanish Air and Space Force designation is CE.15. The E is for &quot;Entrenamiento&quot;, meaning training in Spanish. They were first upgraded to the EF-18B+ version in 1992.

;KAF-18 Hornet
* KAF-18C: Single-seat fighter/attack version for the Kuwait Air Force
* KAF-18D: Two-seat training version for the Kuwait Air Force
;F-18C/D Hornet
* The Finnish Air Force uses F/A-18C/D Hornets, with a Finland-specific mid-life update. The first seven Hornets (D models) were produced by McDonnell Douglas. The 57 single-seat F-18C model units were assembled by Patria in Finland. These variants were delivered without air-to-ground capability so the letter A was dropped from the name. The Mid-Life Upgrade 2 (MLU 2) performed from 2012 to 2016 provided Finnish hornets with air-to-ground mission capability, allowing it to deploy air-to-ground weapons such as JDAMs, JSOWs and JASSMs, alongside avionics and air-to-air missile upgrades. Official Finnish sources now also use the F/A-18C/D designation.

;F-18C/D Hornet
* Switzerland uses F-18C/D, later Swiss specific mid-life update. The Swiss F-18s had no ground attack capability originally, until hardware was retrofitted.

==Operators==

==Notable accidents==

* On 8 December 2008, a U.S. Marine Corps F/A-18D crashed in a populated area of San Diego, California while on approach to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, killing four people on the ground. The pilot ejected safely; there was no weapon systems officer (WSO) on board the aircraft.
* On 6 April 2012, a USN F/A-18D from VFA-106 crashed into apartment buildings in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Both crew members ejected. Seven people were injured including the two pilots, who were taken to the hospital; all survived. The crew performed a last-second fuel dump, and thus may have prevented a large explosion and fire after the crash.
*On 2 June 2016, U.S. Marine Corps Captain Jeff Kuss fatally crashed due to weather and fatigue, during a training exercise to prepare for the Great Tennessee Air Show. Capt. Kuss&#x27;s jet (Blue Angels No. 6) crashed about two miles from the runway after an attempted &quot;Split S&quot; maneuver.
* On 24 August 2023, a U.S. Marine Corps F/A-18D crashed after taking off from Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. The sole pilot onboard died after ejecting from the aircraft.

<text>Gecko (stylized as ɢecko) is a browser engine developed by Mozilla. It is used in the Firefox browser, the Thunderbird email client, and many other projects.

Gecko is designed to support open Internet standards, and is used by different applications to display web pages and, in some cases, an application&#x27;s user interface itself (by rendering XUL). Gecko offers a rich programming API that makes it suitable for a wide variety of roles in Internet-enabled applications, such as web browsers, content presentation, and client/server.

Gecko is written in C++ and JavaScript, and, since 2016, additionally in Rust. It is free and open-source software subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License version 2. Mozilla officially supports its use on Android, Linux, macOS, and Windows.

==History==
Development of the layout engine now known as Gecko began at Netscape in 1997, following the company&#x27;s purchase of DigitalStyle. The existing Netscape rendering engine, originally written for Netscape Navigator 1.0 and upgraded through the years, was slow, did not comply well with W3C standards, had limited support for dynamic HTML and lacked features such as incremental reflow (when the layout engine rearranges elements on the screen as new data is downloaded and added to the page). The new layout engine was developed in parallel with the old, with the intention being to integrate it into Netscape Communicator when it was mature and stable. At least one more major revision of Netscape was expected to be released with the old layout engine before the switch.

After the launch of the Mozilla project in early 1998, the new layout engine code was released under an open-source license. Originally unveiled as &quot;Raptor&quot;, the name had to be changed to &quot;NGLayout&quot; (next generation layout) due to trademark problems. Netscape later rebranded NGLayout as &quot;Gecko&quot;. While Mozilla Organization (the forerunner of the Mozilla Foundation) initially continued to use the NGLayout name (Gecko was a Netscape trademark), eventually the Gecko branding won out.

In October 1998, Netscape announced that its next browser would use Gecko (which was still called NGLayout at the time) rather than the old layout engine, requiring large parts of the application to be rewritten. While this decision was popular with web standards advocates, it was largely unpopular with Netscape developers, who were unhappy with the six months given for the rewrite. It also meant that most of the work done for Netscape Communicator 5.0 (including development on the Mariner improvements to the old layout engine) had to be abandoned. Netscape 6, the first Netscape release to incorporate Gecko, was released in November 2000 (the name Netscape 5 was never used).

As Gecko development continued, other applications and embedders began to make use of it. America Online, by this time Netscape&#x27;s parent company, eventually adopted it for use in CompuServe 7.0 and AOL for Mac OS X (these products had previously embedded Internet Explorer). However, with the exception of a few betas, Gecko was never used in the main Microsoft Windows AOL client.

On July 15, 2003, AOL laid off the remaining Gecko developers and the Mozilla Foundation (formed on the same day) became the main steward of Gecko development. Today, Gecko is developed by employees of the Mozilla Corporation, employees of companies that contribute to the Mozilla project, and volunteers.

In the Netscape era, a combination of poor technical and management decisions resulted in Gecko software bloat. Thus in 2001 Apple chose to fork KHTML, not Gecko, to create the WebKit engine for its Safari browser. However, by 2008 Mozilla had addressed some of the bloat problems, resulting in significant performance improvements for Gecko.

In October 2016, Mozilla announced Quantum, an ongoing project encompassing several software development efforts to &quot;build the next-generation web engine for Firefox users&quot;. It included numerous improvements to Gecko, taken from the experimental Servo project. Firefox 57, also known as &quot;Firefox Quantum&quot;, first shipping in November 2017, is the initial version with major components from the Quantum/Servo projects enabled. These include increased performance in the CSS and GPU rendering components. Additional components will be merged from Servo to Gecko incrementally in future versions.

In September 2018, Mozilla announced GeckoView, the foundation of Mozilla&#x27;s next generation of mobile products based on a software library that makes Gecko reusable for Android, encompassing newer software development efforts to &quot;decouple the engine itself from its user interface, and made it easy to embed in other applications&quot;. Firefox Focus 7.0, shipped in the same month, is the initial version introduced GeckoView, with increased performance in median page loading. Firefox Reality was also built with GeckoView. In June 2019, Mozilla announced Firefox Preview as an ongoing project that focuses on building an Android web browser with GeckoView. Firefox for Android 79, also known as &quot;Firefox Daylight&quot;, first shipping in August 2020, is the first stable release of that with major components powered by GeckoView engine.

==Standards support==

From the outset, Gecko was designed to support open Internet standards. Some of the standards Gecko supports include:

* CSS Level 3
* DOM
* HTML5
* JavaScript (ECMAScript ES6 or superior, currently ECMAScript 2021 ES12), implemented in SpiderMonkey
* MathML
* RDF
* XForms (via an official extension)
* XHTML 1.0
* XML 1.0
* XSLT and XPath, implemented in TransforMiiX

Gecko also supports SVG.

==Legacy IE non-standard support==
In order to support web pages designed for legacy versions of Netscape and Internet Explorer, Gecko supports DOCTYPE switching. Documents with a modern DOCTYPE are rendered in standards compliance mode, which follows the W3C standards strictly. Documents that have no DOCTYPE or an older DOCTYPE are rendered in quirks mode, which emulates some of the non-standard oddities of Netscape Communicator 4.x; however, some of the 4.x features (such as layers) are not supported.

Gecko also has limited support for some non-standard Internet Explorer features, such as the marquee element and the codice_1 property (though pages explicitly testing for codice_1 will be told it is not supported).

==Usage==
Gecko is primarily used in web browsers, the earliest being Netscape 6 and Mozilla Suite (later renamed SeaMonkey). It is also used in other Mozilla web browser derivatives such as Firefox and Firefox for mobile and the implementation of the Internet Explorer-clone that is part of Wine. Mozilla also uses it in their Thunderbird email-client.

Other web browsers using Gecko include GNU IceCat,Midori, Waterfox, K-Meleon, Lunascape, Portable Firefox, Conkeror, Classilla, TenFourFox.

Gecko is also used by Sugar for the OLPC XO-1 computer, and is used as a complete implementation of the XUL (XML User Interface Language). Gecko currently defines the XUL specification. Gecko is also used by the KaiOS mobile operating system, which is based on the discontinued Firefox OS.

=== Past users ===
Products that formerly used Gecko include Pale Moon (now using Goanna), Epiphany (now known as GNOME Web and using WebKitGTK), and GNOME DevHelp (now using WebKitGTK).

Discontinued products that used Gecko include Swiftfox, Flock, Galeon, Camino, Minimo, Beonex Communicator, Kazehakase, Songbird, Sunbird (calendar), MicroB, Nightingale, Instantbird, and Picasa for Linux.

=== Proprietary dependency ===
On Windows and other platforms, Gecko depends on proprietary compilers.

After Gecko 2.0, the version number was bumped to 5.0 to match Firefox 5, and from then on has been kept in sync with the major version number for both Firefox and Thunderbird, to reflect the fact that it is no longer a separate component.

==Quantum==
Quantum is a Mozilla project encompassing several software development efforts to &quot;build the next-generation web engine for Firefox users&quot;. It includes numerous improvements to Gecko, largely incorporated from the experimental Servo project. Quantum also includes refinements to the user interface and interactions.

Firefox 57, released in November 2017, is the initial version with a Servo component enabled. Mozilla dubs this and several planned future releases &quot;Firefox Quantum&quot;.

===Background===
In 2012, Mozilla began the experimental Servo project, which is an engine designed from scratch with the goals of improving concurrency and parallelism while also reducing memory safety vulnerabilities. Servo is written in the Rust programming language, also created by Mozilla, which is designed to generate compiled code with better memory safety, concurrency, and parallelism than compiled C++ code.

As of April 2016, Servo needed at least several years of development to become a full-featured browser engine, hence the decision to start the Quantum project to bring stable portions of Servo into Firefox. Mozilla laid off all Servo developers in August 2020.

===Components===
The Quantum project is composed of several sub-projects.

* CSS: Servo&#x27;s parallel style sheet system integrated into Gecko. Benchmarks suggest that performance scales linearly with number of CPU cores. This was released in Firefox 57.
* Render: Servo&#x27;s rendering architecture, called WebRender, integrated into Gecko in 2019, 2 years after the first Firefox Quantum release, Firefox 67. WebRender replaces the immediate mode drawing model with a retained mode model that is more easily accelerated by the GPU by taking advantage of CSS/DOM&#x27;s similarity to a scene graph. Worst-case scenario rendering in testing exceeds 60 frames per second. Mozilla began enabling the new renderer for select hardware/OS combinations in Firefox 67.
* Compositor: Gecko&#x27;s existing compositor moved to its own process, isolating browser tabs from graphics driver related crashes. Since compositor crashes will not bring down the browser content process, the compositor process can be restarted transparently without losing user data. This was released in Firefox 53.
* DOM: Loosely inspired by Servo&#x27;s Constellation architecture and Opera&#x27;s Presto engine, Quantum DOM uses cooperatively scheduled threads within the DOM to increase responsiveness without increasing the number of processes and, thus, memory usage. The core of this shipped in Firefox 57.
* Flow: An umbrella for user visible performance improvements driven by a team that works across Gecko components. Focused on real user performance improvements on major webapps, primarily G Suite (now called Google Workspace) and Facebook. This work completed and shipped for Firefox 57.
* Photon: A UI refresh of the entire application, with a strong focus on improving UI performance. Treated as a sister project to Quantum Flow. This was released in Firefox 57.
* Network: Improve the performance of Necko, Gecko&#x27;s networking layer, by moving more network activity off the main thread, context dependent prioritization of networking streams, and racing the cache layer with the network. This feature was released in Firefox 59.

== Azure ==
The Mozilla Azure project is a stateless low-level graphics abstraction API used in Firefox.&lt;br&gt;
The project has several objectives including:
* more accurate Direct2D compatibility
* optimized state interoperability
* improved control over performance characteristics and bugs
Azure will provide 2D hardware acceleration on top of 3D graphics backends. Firefox began using Azure instead of Cairo in 2012. It is written in C++ and used by Servo. The Azure name is an ode to the early Netscape founder James H. Clark and his earlier work at Silicon Graphics where workstations were often named after colors.

<text>Alexandru Ioan Cuza (, or Alexandru Ioan I, also Anglicised as Alexander John Cuza; 20 March 1820 – 15 May 1873) was the first &quot;domnitor&quot; (prince) of the Romanian Principalities through his double election as Prince of Moldavia on 5 January 1859 and Prince of Wallachia on 24 January 1859, which resulted in the unification of the two states. He was a prominent figure of the Moldavian Revolution of 1848. Following his double election, he initiated a series of reforms that contributed to the modernization of Romanian society and of state structures.

As ruler of the Romanian Principalities, he supported a political and diplomatic activity for the recognition of the union of Moldavia and Wallachia by the suzerain Ottoman Empire and achieved constitutional and administrative unity between Moldavia and Wallachia in 1862, when the Romanian Principalities officially adopted the name Romanian United Principalities with a single capital at Bucharest, a single national assembly and a single government.

Cuza&#x27;s reform policies alienated a large coalition of conservatives and radical liberals, for the most part landowners and business owners. On 22 February 1866, he was forced to abdicate and leave the country. Today, he is often considered one of the founders of the modern Romanian state and a national hero of Romania.

==Early life==
Born in Bârlad, Cuza belonged to the traditional boyar class in Moldavia, the son of Ispravnic Ioan Cuza (who was also a landowner in Fălciu County) and his wife Sultana (or Soltana), a member of the Cozadini family of Phanariote and Genovese origins. Alexander received an urbane European education in Jassy, Pavia, Bologna, and Athens; after a brief period of military service, he was also educated in Paris from 1837 to 1840. He became an officer in the Moldavian Army and rose to the rank of colonel. He married Elena Rosetti in 1844.
During the Revolutions of 1848, Moldavia and Wallachia fell into revolt. The Moldavian unrest was quickly suppressed, but in Wallachia the revolutionaries took power and governed during the summer. Young Cuza played a prominent enough part to establish his liberal credentials. He was shipped to Vienna as a prisoner, where he made his escape with British support.

Returning during the reign of Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica, he became Moldavia&#x27;s minister of war in 1858; he also represented Galați in the ad hoc Divan at Iași. Cuza was acting freely under the guarantees of the European Powers in the eve of the Crimean War for recognition of a Prince of Moldavia. Cuza was a prominent speaker in the debates and strongly advocated the union of Moldavia and Wallachia. In default of a foreign prince, he was nominated as a candidate in both principalities by the pro-unionist Partida Națională (profiting of an ambiguity in the text of the Treaty of Paris). Cuza was finally elected as Prince of Moldavia on 17 January 1859 (5 January Julian) and, after &quot;street pressure&quot; changed the vote in Bucharest, also Prince of Wallachia, on 5 February 1859 (24 January Julian), effectively uniting both principalities. He received the firman from the Sultan on 2 December 1861 during a visit to Istanbul.
He was a recipient of the Order of Medjidie, Order of Osmanieh, Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus, and Order of the Redeemer.

Although he and his wife Elena Rosetti had no children, she raised as her own children his two sons by his mistress Elena Maria Catargiu-Obrenović: Alexandru Al. Ioan Cuza (1864–1889), and Dimitrie Cuza (1865–1888 &quot;suicide&quot;).

==Reign==

===Diplomatic efforts===
Thus Cuza achieved a de facto union of the two principalities. The Powers backtracked, with Napoleon III of France remaining supportive, while the Austrian ministry withheld approval of such a union at the Congress of Paris (18 October 1858); partly as a consequence, Cuza&#x27;s authority was not recognized by his nominal suzerain, Abdülaziz, the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, until 23 December 1861. Even then, the union was only accepted for the duration of Cuza&#x27;s rule.

The union was formally declared three years later, on 5 February 1862, (24 January Julian), the new country bearing the name of Romania, with Bucharest as its capital city.

Cuza invested his diplomatic actions in gaining further concessions from the Powers: the sultan&#x27;s assent to a single unified parliament and cabinet for Cuza&#x27;s lifetime, in recognition of the complexity of the task. Thus, he was regarded as the political embodiment of a unified Romania.

===Reforms===

Assisted by his councilor Mihail Kogălniceanu, an intellectual leader of the 1848 revolution, Cuza initiated a series of reforms that contributed to the modernization of Romanian society and of state structures.

His first measure addressed a need for increasing the land resources and revenues available to the state, by nationalizing monastic estates in 1863. Probably more than a quarter of Romania&#x27;s farmland was controlled by untaxed Eastern Orthodox &quot;Dedicated monasteries&quot;, which supported Greek and other foreign monks in shrines such as Mount Athos and Jerusalem, presenting a substantial drain on state revenues. Cuza got his parliament&#x27;s backing to expropriate these lands.

During the secularization of the Antiochian Metochion in Bucharest, Cuza exiled its proistamenos the Metropolitan Ioannikios of Palmyra and arrested its hegumen Seraphim, later Metropolitan of Irenopolis in Isauria. He offered compensation to the Greek Orthodox Church, but Sophronius III, the Patriarch of Constantinople, refused to negotiate; after several years, the Romanian government withdrew its offer and no compensation was ever paid. State revenues thereby increased without adding any domestic tax burden.
The land reform, liberating peasants from the last corvées, freeing their movements and redistributing some land (1864), was less successful. In attempting to create a solid support base among the peasants, Cuza soon found himself in conflict with the group of Conservatives. A liberal bill granting peasants title to the land they worked was defeated. Then the Conservatives responded with a bill that ended all peasant dues and responsibilities, but gave landlords title to all the land. Cuza vetoed it, then held a plebiscite to alter the Paris Convention (the virtual constitution), in the manner of Napoleon III.


His plan to establish universal manhood suffrage, together with the power of the Domnitor to rule by decree, passed by a vote of 682,621 to 1,307. This was an imperfect solution, still catering to the wealthy, and would be added onto with a constitution revision in 1866 after his abdication. He consequently governed the country under the provisions of &quot;Statutul dezvoltător al Convenției de la Paris&quot; (&quot;Statute expanding the Paris Convention&quot;), an organic law adopted on 15 July 1864. With his new plenary powers, Cuza then promulgated the Agrarian Law of 1863. Peasants received title to the land they worked, while landlords retained ownership of one third. Where there was not enough land available to create workable farms under this formula, state lands (from the confiscated monasteries) would be used to give the landowners compensation.

Despite the attempts by Lascăr Catargiu&#x27;s cabinet to force a transition in which some corvées were to be maintained, Cuza&#x27;s reform marked the disappearance of the boyar class as a privileged group, and led to a channeling of energies into capitalism and industrialization; at the same time, however, land distributed was still below necessities, and the problem became stringent over the following decades – as peasants reduced to destitution sold off their land or found that it was insufficient for the needs of their growing families.

Cuza&#x27;s reforms also included the adoption of the Criminal Code and the Civil Code based on the Napoleonic code (1864), a Law on Education, establishing tuition-free, compulsory public education for primary schools (1864; the system, nonetheless, suffered from drastic shortages in allocated funds; illiteracy was eradicated about 100 years later, during the communist regime). He founded the University of Iași (1860) and the University of Bucharest (1864), and helped develop a modern, European-style Romanian Army, under a working relationship with France. He is the founder of the Romanian Naval Forces.

==Downfall and exile==
Cuza failed in his effort to create an alliance of prosperous peasants and a strong liberal prince, ruling as a benevolent authoritarian in the style of Napoleon III. Having to rely on a decreasing group of hand-picked bureaucrats, Cuza began facing a mounting opposition after his land reform bill, with liberal landowners voicing concerns over his ability to represent their interests. Along with financial distress, there was an awkward scandal that revolved around his mistress, Maria Catargiu-Obrenović, and popular discontent culminated in a coup d&#x27;état.

Cuza was forced to abdicate by the so-called &quot;monstrous coalition&quot; of Conservatives and Liberals. At four o&#x27;clock on the morning of 11 February 1866, a group of military conspirators broke into the palace, and compelled the prince to sign his abdication. On the following day they conducted him safely across the border.

His successor, Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, was proclaimed Domnitor as Carol I of Romania on 20 April 1866. The election of a foreign prince with ties to an important princely house, legitimizing Romanian independence (which Carol came to do after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878), had been one of the liberal aims in the revolution of 1848.

Despite the participation of Ion Brătianu and other future leaders of the Liberal Party in the overthrow of Cuza, he remained a hero to the radical and republican wing, who, as Francophiles, had an additional reason to oppose a Prussian monarch; anti-Carol riots in Bucharest during the Franco-Prussian War (&quot;see History of Bucharest&quot;) and the coup attempt known as the Republic of Ploiești in August 1870, the conflict was eventually resolved by the compromise between Brătianu and Carol, with the arrival of a prolonged and influential Liberal cabinet.

Cuza spent the remainder of his life in exile, chiefly in Paris, Vienna and Wiesbaden, accompanied by his wife and his two sons. He died in Heidelberg on 15 May 1873. His remains were buried in his residence in Ruginoasa, but were moved to the Trei Ierarhi Cathedral in Iași after World War II.

<text>A browser engine (also known as a layout engine or rendering engine) is a core software component of every major web browser. The primary job of a browser engine is to transform HTML documents and other resources of a web page into an interactive visual representation on a user&#x27;s device.

==Name and scope==

Besides &quot;browser engine&quot;, two other related terms are commonly used: &quot;layout engine&quot; and &quot;rendering engine&quot;. In theory, layout and (or &quot;painting&quot;) could be handled by different engines. In practice, however, these components are tightly coupled and rarely encountered on their own outside of the browser engine.

In addition to layout and rendering, a browser engine enforces the security policy between documents, handles navigation through hyperlinks and data submitted through forms, and implements the document object model (DOM) exposed to scripts associated with the document.

To provide a wide range of dynamic behavior for web pages, every major browser supports JavaScript. However, JavaScript is implemented as a separate JavaScript engine, which has enabled its usage elsewhere. In a browser, the two engines are coordinated via the DOM and Web IDL bindings.

Browser engines are also used in non-browser applications. An email client needs one to display HTML email. Beginning in the 2010s, many apps have been created with the frameworks based on Google&#x27;s Chromium project; each of these standalone apps functions much like a web app. (Two examples are Spotify and Slack.)

==Layout and rendering==

The layout of a web page is typically specified by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Each style sheet is a series of rules for how the page should be presented. For example, some rules specify typography details, such as font, color, and text size, while others determine the placement of images. The engine combines all relevant CSS rules to calculate precise graphical coordinates for the visual representation it will paint on the screen.

Some engines may begin rendering before a page&#x27;s resources are downloaded. This can result in visual changes as more data is received, such as images being gradually filled in or a flash of unstyled content.

==Notable engines==
* Apple created the WebKit engine for its Safari browser by forking the KHTML engine of the KDE project. Apple mandates that all browsers on iOS must use WebKit as their engine. (In 2024, the mandate was removed for the European Union, but it is still enforced elsewhere.)
* Google originally used WebKit for its Chrome browser but eventually forked it to create the Blink engine. All Chromium-based browsers use Blink, as do applications built with CEF, Electron, or any other framework that embeds Chromium.
* Microsoft has two proprietary engines, Trident and EdgeHTML. Trident, also called MSHTML, is used in the Internet Explorer browser. EdgeHTML, being a fork of Trident, was the original engine of the Edge browser (now called Edge Legacy); it&#x27;s still found in some UWP apps. The new, Chromium-based Edge was remade with the Blink engine.
* Mozilla develops the Gecko engine for its Firefox browser and the Thunderbird email client.
