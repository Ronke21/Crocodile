<text>Luchino Visconti di Modrone, Count of Lonate Pozzolo (; 2 November 1906 – 17 March 1976) was an Italian filmmaker, theatre and opera director, and screenwriter. He was one of the fathers of cinematic neorealism, but later moved towards luxurious, sweeping epics dealing with themes of beauty, decadence, death, and European history, especially the decay of the nobility and the bourgeoisie. Critic Jonathan Jones wrote that “no one did as much to shape Italian cinema as Luchino Visconti.”

Born into a Milanese noble family with close ties to the artistic world, Visconti began his career in France as an assistant director to Jean Renoir. His 1943 directorial debut, , was condemned by the Fascist regime for its unvarnished depictions of working-class characters, but is today renowned as a pioneering work of Italian cinema, generally regarded as the first neorealist film. During World War II, he served in the anti-fascist resistance, and afterwards was active in left-wing politics.

Visconti&#x27;s best-known films include &quot;Senso&quot; (1954) and &quot;The Leopard&quot; (1963), which are historical melodramas adapted from Italian literary classics, the gritty drama &quot;Rocco and His Brothers&quot; (1960), and his &quot;German Trilogy&quot; – &quot;The Damned&quot; (1969), &quot;Death in Venice&quot; (1971) and &quot;Ludwig&quot; (1973). He was also an accomplished director of operas and stage plays, both in Italy and abroad, and held a close association with La Scala in his hometown of Milan.

Visconti received several notable accolades, including both the (for &quot;The Leopard&quot;) and the Golden Lion (for 1965&#x27;s &quot;Sandra&quot;), the latter out of five total nominations. He won the David di Donatello for Best Director twice and the Nastro d&#x27;Argento for Best Director four times, and was both an Oscar and BAFTA Award nominee. Six of Visconti&#x27;s films are on the list of 100 Italian films to be saved. Many of his works are regarded as highly-influential to future generations of filmmakers, including Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese.

==Early life==
Luchino Visconti was born into a prominent noble family in Milan, one of seven children of Giuseppe Visconti di Modrone, Duke of Grazzano Visconti and Count of Lonate Pozzolo, and his wife Carla (&quot;née&quot; Erba, heiress to Erba Pharmaceuticals). He was formally known as Count &quot;don&quot; Luchino Visconti di Modrone, and his family is a branch of the Visconti of Milan where they ruled from 1277 to 1447, initially as lords, then as dukes.

He grew up in the Milanese family seat, the &quot;Palazzo Visconti di Modrone&quot; in Via Cerva, as well as on the family estate, &quot;Grazzano Visconti Castle&quot; near Vigolzone. He was baptized and raised in the Roman Catholic church. After his parents separated in the early 1920s, his mother moved with her younger children, including him, to her own house in Milan, as well as to her summer residence, Villa Erba in Cernobbio on Lake Como. The father, as chamberlain of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, also owned a villa in Rome that Luchino later inherited and lived in for decades.

In his early years, he was exposed to art, music and theatre: The &quot;Palazzo Visconti di Modrone&quot; in Milan, where he grew up, had its own small private theatre and the children participated in its performances. The family also had their own box in the La Scala opera house. Luchino studied cello with the Italian cellist and composer Lorenzo de Paolis (1890–1965) and met the composer Giacomo Puccini, the conductor Arturo Toscanini and the writer Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio. Visconti found literature by reading Proust&#x27;s &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;, later a lifelong film project that he never realized. Before he started his film career, he was passionate about training racehorses in his own stable. He was engaged to Princess Irma of Windisch-Graetz, but this raised concerns with her father, Prince Hugo, and Visconti broke the engagement off in 1935.

== Wartime resistance activity ==
During World War II, Visconti joined the Italian Communist Party, which he considered to be the only effective opponent of Italian Fascism. While he had, in his early years, been impressed by such aesthetic aspects of the solemn parades of the National Fascist Party as marching in columns in boots and uniform, he had now come to hate the Mussolini regime. He accused the bourgeoisie of treason to tyranny, and following the Badoglio Proclamation, began working with the Italian resistance. He supported the communists&#x27; partisan fight at the risk of death; his villa in Rome became a meeting place for oppositional artists.

After the king&#x27;s flight in the autumn of 1943 and the intervention of the Germans, he went into hiding in the mountains, at Settefrati, under the nom de guerre &quot;Alfredo Guidi&quot;. Visconti helped English and American prisoners of war hide after they had escaped, and also gave shelter to partisans in his house in Rome, with the help of actress María Denis.

After the German occupation of Rome in April 1944, Visconti was arrested and detained by the anti-partisan Pietro Koch and sentenced to execution by firing squad. He was only saved from death by Denis&#x27; last-minute intervention. After the war, Visconti testified against Koch, who was himself convicted and executed.

==Career==
===Films===
He began his film-making career as a set dresser on Jean Renoir&#x27;s &quot;Partie de campagne&quot; (1936) through the intercession of their common friend Coco Chanel. After a short tour of the United States, where he visited Hollywood, he returned to Italy to be Renoir&#x27;s assistant again, this time for &quot;Tosca&quot; (1941), a production that was interrupted and later completed by German director Karl Koch.

Together with fellow members of the Milanese film journal &quot;Cinema -&quot; Gianni Puccini, Antonio Pietrangeli and Giuseppe De Santis - Visconti wrote the screenplay for his first film as director: (&quot;Obsession&quot;, 1943), one of the first examples of neorealist (involving real locations and regular people) movies and an unofficial adaptation of the novel &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot;. The premiere of took place at a film festival hosted by Vittorio Mussolini (son of Benito), who was the national arbiter for cinema and other arts, and the editor of &quot;Cinema&quot;. Though prior to the premiere their working relationship was positive, upon viewing the film Vittorio stormed out of the theatre exclaiming: &quot;This is not Italy!&quot;, according to the account of &quot;Cinema&quot; group contributor Aldo Scagnetti. The film was subsequently suppressed by the fascist regime, to the extent that the first public showing of the film in Rome only occurred in May 1945.

In 1948, he wrote and directed &quot;La terra trema&quot; (&quot;The Earth Trembles&quot;), based on the novel &quot;I Malavoglia&quot; by Giovanni Verga. 
Visconti continued working throughout the 1950s, but he veered away from the neorealist path with his 1954 film, &quot;Senso&quot;, shot in colour. Based on the novella by Camillo Boito, it is set in Austrian-occupied Venice in 1866. In this film, Visconti combines realism and romanticism as a way to break away from neorealism. However, as one biographer notes, &quot;Visconti without neorealism is like Lang without expressionism and Eisenstein without formalism&quot;. He describes the film as the &quot;most Viscontian&quot; of all Visconti&#x27;s films. Visconti returned to neorealism once more with &quot;Rocco e i suoi fratelli&quot; (&quot;Rocco and His Brothers&quot;, 1960), the story of Southern Italians who migrate to Milan hoping to find financial stability. In 1961, he was a member of the jury at the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival.

Turning away from neo-realism, Visconti created an unmistakable visual language in his films from the 1960s onwards. Thanks to his unique blend of aristocratic and upper-class origins, communist political convictions and brilliant social analysis, he created masterpieces of film history in The Leopard (1963), The Damned (1969), Death in Venice (1971) and Ludwig (1972). 
Throughout the 1960s, Visconti&#x27;s films became more personal. &quot;Il Gattopardo&quot; (&quot;The Leopard&quot;, 1963) is based on Lampedusa&#x27;s novel of the same name about the decline of the Sicilian aristocracy at the time of the Risorgimento, where the change of times becomes visible in two of the main characters: Don Fabrizio Corbera, Prince of Salina (Burt Lancaster) appears patriarchal but humane, while Don Calogero Sedara (Paolo Stoppa), a shrewd entrepreneur and social climber from the village, appears submissive, but foxy and brutal at the same time, a mafia-like type of the future. The tension arises from the marriage of their relatives of the next generation, combined with the fall of the old Bourbon rule and the rise of a united Italy. This film was distributed in America and Britain by Twentieth-Century Fox, which deleted important scenes. Visconti repudiated the Twentieth-Century Fox version.

It was not until &quot;The Damned&quot; (1969) that Visconti received a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The film, one of Visconti&#x27;s better-known works, concerns a German industrialist&#x27;s family which begins to disintegrate during the Nazi consolidation of power in the 1930s. The film opened to widespread critical acclaim, but also faced controversy from rating boards for its sexual content, including depictions of homosexuality, pedophilia, rape, and incest. In the United States, the film was given an X rating. The avant-garde filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder praised it as his favourite movie. Its decadence and lavish beauty are characteristic of Visconti&#x27;s aesthetic − very visible also in the movie &quot;Death in Venice&quot; (1971) that adapted the daring novella &quot;Death in Venice&quot; published in 1912 by Thomas Mann.

Visconti&#x27;s final film was &quot;The Innocent&quot; (1976), in which he returns to his recurring interest in infidelity and betrayal.

===Theatre===

Visconti was also a celebrated theatre and opera director. During the years 1946 to 1960, he directed many performances of the Rina Morelli-Paolo Stoppa Company with actor Vittorio Gassman as well as many celebrated productions of operas.

Visconti&#x27;s love of opera is evident in the 1954 &quot;Senso&quot;, where the beginning of the film shows scenes from the fourth act of &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, which were filmed at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice. Beginning when he directed a production at Milan&#x27;s Teatro alla Scala of &quot;La vestale&quot; in December 1954, his career included a famous revival of &quot;La traviata&quot; at La Scala in 1955 with Maria Callas and an equally famous &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; (also at La Scala) in 1957 with Callas. A significant 1958 Royal Opera House (London) production of Verdi&#x27;s five-act Italian version of &quot;Don Carlos&quot; (with Jon Vickers) followed, along with a &quot;Macbeth&quot; in Spoleto in 1958 and a famous black-and-white &quot;Il trovatore&quot; with scenery and costumes by Filippo Sanjust at the Royal Opera House in 1964. In 1966 Visconti&#x27;s luscious &quot;Falstaff&quot; for the Vienna State Opera conducted by Leonard Bernstein was critically acclaimed. On the other hand, his austere 1969 &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot; with the singers clothed in geometrical costumes provoked controversy.

== Filmmaking style and themes ==
In the aftermath of World War II he became one of the founding fathers of the Italian neorealistic film movement that focused on challenging economic and conditions, and how it affected the psyche of the underclass. Visconti himself came from nobility, was highly educated and was never in financial lack. His films reflected that tension. In fact, Visconti said he felt he came from a world long ago, that of the previous (19th) century.

In the film &quot;The Leopard&quot;, he addressed the decline of an old social order and the rise of “modern times”. He did not see his opulent flashbacks as an escape into imaginary, lost worlds, but rather as the deciphering of signs. He wanted to put his finger on the signs of profound historical changes which would only become visible later. He searched world literature for relevant works to show the discrepancies between generations and their world views, as a task of realism in art. When he was accused of decadence, he recalled Thomas Mann and his way of creating art.

== Personal life ==
In later years, Visconti made no secret of his homosexuality, though he remained a devout Catholic throughout his life. &quot;I am a Catholic,&quot; he commented in 1971. &quot;I was born a Catholic, I was baptized a Catholic. I cannot change what I am, I cannot easily become a Protestant. My ideas may be unorthodox, but I am still a Catholic.&quot; While his first 3-year-relationship from 1936, with the photographer 
Horst P. Horst, remained discreet because of the prejudices of the time, he later showed up openly in the company of his lovers, among them the director and producer Franco Zeffirelli and the actor Udo Kier. His last lover was the Austrian actor Helmut Berger, who played Martin in Visconti&#x27;s film &quot;The Damned&quot;. Berger also appeared in Visconti&#x27;s &quot;Ludwig&quot; in 1973 and &quot;Conversation Piece&quot; in 1974, along with Burt Lancaster. Zeffirelli also worked as part of the crew in production design, as assistant director, and other roles in a number of Visconti&#x27;s films, operas, and theatrical productions. According to Visconti&#x27;s autobiography, he and Umberto II of Italy had a romantic relationship during their youth in the 1920s.

Visconti was hostile to the Protests of 1968 and didn&#x27;t even try to follow the movement and adopt the airs of youth, like Alberto Moravia or Pier Paolo Pasolini did (although the latter was certainly not sympathetic towards the protestors). In his view, the protesters sought change for the sake of destruction without building something new. Disgusted, he looked at the young people in their enthusiasm, outbursts of anger, parties and tumults, their abstract speeches, their juggling with Mao, Marx, and Che Guevara. They saw him as a symbol of reaction, a member of the mandarin caste. The emerging radical-left terrorism in Italy frightened him and made him fear the rise of a new fascism.

Visconti has a grandnephew, Uberto Pasolini, who is also a filmmaker. (Uberto, however, has no known relation to the aforementioned director, Pier Paolo Pasolini.)

== Health issues and death ==

Visconti smoked 120 cigarettes a day. He suffered a serious stroke in 1972, but continued to smoke heavily. He died in Rome of another stroke at the age of sixty-nine on 17 March 1976. 
The church funeral service for Visconti took place on March 19, 1976, in Sant&#x27;Ignazio di Loyola in Campo Marzio in Rome. In addition to the Visconti family, the Italian President Giovanni Leone and the actors Burt Lancaster, Claudia Cardinale, Laura Antonelli, Vittorio Gassman and Helmut Berger were present.

There is a museum dedicated to the director&#x27;s work in Ischia where he had his summer residence &quot;La Colombaia&quot;.

<text>Cesare Zavattini (20 September 1902 – 13 October 1989) was an Italian screenwriter and one of the first theorists and proponents of the Neorealist movement in Italian cinema.

== Biography ==
Born in Luzzara near Reggio Emilia in northern Italy, on 20 September 1902, Zavattini studied law at the University of Parma, but devoted himself to writing. He started his career in &quot;Gazzetta di Parma&quot;. In 1930 he relocated to Milan, and worked for the book and magazine publisher Angelo Rizzoli. After Rizzoli began producing films in 1934, Zavattini received his first screenplay and story credits in 1936. At the same time he was writing the plot for the comic strip &quot;Saturn against the Earth&quot; with Federico Pedrocchi (script) and Giovanni Scolari (art) for &quot;I tre porcellini&quot; (1936–1937) and &quot;Topolino&quot; (1937–1946).

In 1935, he met Vittorio De Sica, beginning a partnership that produced some twenty films, including such masterpieces of Italian neorealism as &quot;Sciuscià&quot; (1946), &quot;Ladri di biciclette&quot; (1948), &quot;Miracolo a Milano&quot; (1951), and &quot;Umberto D.&quot; (1952).

In 1952, Zavattini gave an interview to The Italian Film Magazine 2, republished in English as &quot;Some Ideas on the Cinema&quot;. The thirteen points Zavattini outlined are widely regarded as his manifesto to Italian neorealism.

In his only experience in Hollywood, Zavattini wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Children of Sanchez&quot; (1978) based on Oscar Lewis&#x27;s book of the same title, a classic study of a Mexican family. At the 11th Moscow International Film Festival in 1979, he was awarded the Honorable Prize for the contribution to cinema. In 1983 he was a member of the jury at the 13th Moscow International Film Festival.

Zavattini died in Rome on 13 October 1989.

<text>Sergio Tòfano (20 August 1886 – 28 October 1973) was an Italian actor, theatre director, playwright, scene designer and illustrator.

Tofano was born in Rome. In 1909, he made his first appearance on stage with Ermete Novelli, then joined Virgilio Talli&#x27;s company (1913–23). He soon specialized as a comic actor, giving his role a new elegance and complexity. He worked with other famous actors and directors: Dario Niccodemi (1924–27); Luigi Almirante and Giuditta Rissone (1927–30), Elsa Merlini, Vittorio De Sica, Evi Maltagliati, Gino Cervi etc. During those years, he made his famous performances as Doctor Knock in Jules Romains&#x27; play, and as Professor Toti in Luigi Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Pensaci, Giacomino!&quot;. He also led important theatrical firms.

After the Second World War, he worked with the most important directors, like Luchino Visconti and Giorgio Strehler.

In 1917 Tofano invented, for a children&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Il Corriere dei Piccoli&quot;, a famous character, Signor Bonaventura, whose adventures lasted for more than forty years. He used to sign as &quot;Sto&quot;. He wrote and illustrated several children&#x27;s books and illustrated &quot;The Chess Set in the Mirror&quot; by Massimo Bontempelli.

<text>The seven hills of Rome (, ) east of the river Tiber form the geographical heart of Rome, within the walls of the city.

==Hills==
The seven hills are:

* Aventine Hill (Latin: &quot;Collis Aventinus&quot;; Italian: &quot;Aventino&quot;)
* Caelian Hill (&quot;Collis Caelius&quot;, originally the &quot;Mons Querquetulanus&quot;; &quot;Celio&quot;)
* Capitoline Hill (&quot;Mons Capitolinus&quot;; &quot;Campidoglio&quot;)
* Esquiline Hill (&quot;Collis Esquilinus&quot;; &quot;Esquilino&quot;)
* Palatine Hill (&quot;Collis&quot; or &quot;Mons Palatinus&quot;; &quot;Palatino&quot;)
* Quirinal Hill (&quot;Collis Quirinalis&quot;; &quot;Quirinale&quot;)
* Viminal Hill (&quot;Collis Viminalis&quot;; &quot;Viminale&quot;)

The Vatican Hill (Latin &quot;Collis Vaticanus&quot;) lying northwest of the Tiber, the Pincian Hill (&quot;Mons Pincius&quot;), lying to the north, the Janiculan Hill (Latin &quot;Janiculum&quot;), lying to the west, and the Sacred Mount (Latin &quot;Mons Sacer&quot;), lying to the northeast, are not counted among the traditional Seven Hills, being outside the boundaries of the most ancient part of Rome.

Separate also are the seven hills associated with the Septimontium, a proto-urban festival celebrated by the residents of the seven communities associated with the hills or peaks of Rome. These were the Oppius, Palatium, Velia, Fagutal, Cermalus, Caelius, and Cispius. These are sometimes confused with the traditional seven hills.

==History==
Tradition holds that Romulus and Remus founded the original city on the Palatine Hill on 21 April 753 BC, and that the seven hills were first occupied by small settlements that were not grouped. The seven hills&#x27; denizens began to interact, which began to bond the groups. The city of Rome, thus, came into being as these separate settlements acted as a group, draining the marshy valleys between them and turning them into markets (&quot;fora&quot; in Latin). Later, in the early 4th century BC, the Servian Walls were constructed to protect the seven hills.

In modern Rome, five of the seven hills—the Aventine, Caelian, Esquiline, Quirinal, and Viminal Hills—are now the sites of monuments, buildings, and parks. The Capitoline Hill is the location of Rome&#x27;s city hall, and the Palatine Hill is part of the main archaeological area.

A smaller area was covered by the seven peaks associated with the festival of the Septimontium: the Cispian Hill (&quot;Cispius Mons&quot;), Oppian Hill (&quot;Oppius Mons&quot;), and Fagutal Hill (&quot;Fagutalis Mons&quot;), three spurs of the Esquiline Hill, along with the Palatium and Cermalus, the peaks of the Palatine Hill, the Velian Hill, a ridge joining the Palatine and Oppian Hills, and the Caelian Hill.

===Other cities with seven hills===

Sheffield, Istanbul, Lisbon, Providence and the Massachusetts cities of Worcester, Somerville, and Newton are also said to have been built on seven hills, following the example of Rome.

==In the New Testament==
In the Book of Revelation, the Whore of Babylon sits on &quot;seven mountains&quot;, often understood by Christians as the seven hills of Rome and a reference to the pagan Roman Empire. Protestants later associated them with the Catholic Church (as the Pope is patriarch of Rome).

==In modern literature==
In a 2019 interview Lindsey Davis revealed her plan to set a series of books on the seven hills of Rome, now accomplished with the publication of &quot;A Capitol Death&quot;, seventh in the Flavia Albia series which began with &quot;The Ides of April&quot;, set on the Aventine Hill.

<text>Dąbrowa Górnicza () is a city in Zagłębie Dąbrowskie, southern Poland, near Katowice and Sosnowiec. It is located in eastern part of the Silesian Voivodeship, on the Czarna Przemsza and Biała Przemsza rivers (tributaries of the Vistula, see Przemsza).

Even though Dąbrowa Górnicza belongs to the historic province of Lesser Poland, it now is situated in the Silesian Voivodeship. Dąbrowa Górnicza is one of the cities of the Katowice urban area (2.7 million people), and within the greater Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area (5.2 million people). The population of the city itself as of December 2021 is 116,971.

== Locality and districts ==
Dąbrowa Górnicza is the largest city of the province and the 9th largest in Poland in terms of territory, with total area of 188 square kilometers. The city lies among the hills, at 258 to 390 meters above sea level. Dąbrowa Górnicza borders Będzin County, Zawiercie County, Olkusz County and the city of Sosnowiec. At the same time it borders the cities and towns of Sosnowiec, Będzin, Siewierz and Sławków.

The place name &quot;Dąbrowa&quot;, is derived from the Polish word &quot;dąb&quot; (oak), and denotes an &quot;oak grove&quot;, as the territory of the original village is believed to have been covered by oak forests during the early days of its existence. From the 19th century, the settlement grew to be an important coal-mining center, and its name was supplemented by the adjective &quot;Górnicza&quot; (which refers to mining) in 1919, to distinguish it from such towns, as Dąbrowa Tarnowska and Dąbrowa Białostocka.

=== Districts ===
The city is divided into several districts: Antoniów, Błędów, Bugaj, Centrum, Dziewiąty, Gołonóg, Korzeniec, Kuźniczka Nowa, Łazy Błędowskie, Łęka, Łęknice, Łosień, Marianki, Mydlice, Okradzionów, Piekło, Ratanice, Reden, Sikorka, Strzemieszyce Małe, Strzemieszyce Wielkie, Trzebiesławice, Trzydziesty, Tucznawa, Ujejsce, Ząbkowice. From 1977–1984, the town of Sławków was a district of Dąbrowa Górnicza.

==History==

In the first half of the 18th century, &quot;Dąbrowa&quot; was a small agricultural settlement belonging to the Będzin parish of the Kraków Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province in the Kingdom of Poland. It was first mentioned on 25 July 1726, when the parish priest of Holy Trinity Church at Będzin noted a woman named Anna Lisowa from Dąbrowa. At the 1787 census of the Archdiocese of Kraków, the settlement numbered 184 inhabitants.

The districts of Dąbrowa, which for centuries had comprised separate villages, are much older. Trzebieszowice was first mentioned in the 12th century; Błędów was mentioned by Bishop of Kraków Iwo Odrowąż in the year 1220; Strzemieszyce and Ujejsce were mentioned in the 14th century; Gołonóg in the 15th century; and Ząbkowice was described by Polish historian Jan Długosz in the 15th century.

After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), Dąbrowa was annexed by Prussia and incorporated into its newly formed province of New Silesia. The Prussians discovered rich deposits of coal here and the first coal mine was established by Friedrich Wilhelm von Reden in 1796. In 1799, first detailed map of this area was created, on which a settlement called &quot;Stara Dąbrowa&quot; is presented. It was located along a road from Kraków to Upper Silesia. The coal mine established by von Reden attracted workers, and a settlement was soon established around it.

In 1807, Dąbrowa was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw. After the duchy&#x27;s dissolution in 1815, it became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In 1846, the &quot;Cieszkowski Coal Mine&quot; was opened, named after Józef Cieszkowski. The &quot;Zinc Plant Konstanty&quot; operated as early as 1823, and the &quot;Huta Bankowa&quot; steel works, which is still in operation, was built in Dąbrowa Górnicza in 1834.

The first primary school was opened in 1820, and first Roman Catholic church of St. Alexander was built in the 1870s.

During the January Uprising, in February 1863, Dąbrowa was captured by Polish insurgents after their victory in the Battle of Sosnowiec nearby.
In 1909, the gmina of Dąbrowa Górnicza was established by Tsarist authorities. Even though its population reached 30,000, the Russians were reluctant to grant Dąbrowa town charter, so it remained a village until 18 August 1916, when Austrian authorities, which during World War I occupied southern part of Congress Poland, agreed to establish the town. After the war, in 1918, Poland regained independence and control of the city. 15 local Polish boy scouts were killed in fights for Polish independence in 1914–1920. In the Second Polish Republic, Dąbrowa belonged to Kielce Voivodeship.

===World War II===

In September 1939, in the beginning of World War II, the city was invaded by Germany, and shortly afterwards the German &quot;Einsatzgruppe I&quot; operated in the city and committed various crimes against the Polish population. Also in September 1939, Wehrmacht troops carried out a massacre of 14 Polish boy scouts from nearby villages in the present-day district of Tucznawa. Poles from Dąbrowa Górnicza were among the victims of massacres committed by the Germans in other places, including Sosnowiec on September 4, 1939 and Celiny on June 4, 1940. Under German occupation the city was annexed directly to Germany, and included within the Upper Silesia Province. At least 14 Polish policemen from Dąbrowa were murdered by the Russians in the large Katyn massacre in April–May 1940. Further executions of Poles were carried out by the Germans during the war. Over 40 local Polish boy and girl scouts were killed by the Germans in various places, including the Auschwitz concentration camp and during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, and over 60 local miners were also murdered in Auschwitz. In October 1941, the occupiers expelled over 100 Poles, who were then sent to forced labour either to Germany or to various factories in the region, while their houses were handed over to German colonists as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. The Germans also operated the E513 and E543 forced labour subcamps of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp at the local coal mine. More than 4,000 local Jews were enclosed in a ghetto, and later murdered in death camps. German occupation ended in 1945.

===Recent history===
Together with all of Zagłębie Dąbrowskie, the city was transferred to Katowice Voivodeship after World War II, in 1945.
In 1968, the local church of Saint Mary of the Angels was visited by the Primate of Poland Stefan Wyszyński and cardinal Karol Wojtyła (future Pope John Paul II).

The 1970s saw the construction of the Katowice Steelworks, which is nowadays the biggest steel producing plant in Poland, after privatization owned by ArcelorMittal. In the 1970s the town expanded territorially and economically. In 1975 and 1977 the neighboring localities of Strzemieszyce Małe, Strzemieszyce Wielkie, Ząbkowice and others became suburbanized. The population of Dąbrowa Górnicza reached its peak in 1982 with 152,373 inhabitants. In 1984, the neighboring settlements of Marianki and Ratanice were included within the city limits of Dąbrowa Górnicza as new districts. From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Katowice Voivodeship.

In the 1990s, all local coal mines were closed, because of lack of coal. The oldest part of the town Reden still exists. In 1993, the neighboring settlement of Trzebiesławice was also included within the city limits as a new district.

<doc id="44831" wikidata="Q169757" url="?curid=44831" title="Mortadella">
<text>Mortadella () is a large made of finely hashed or ground cured pork, which incorporates at least 15% small cubes of pork fat (principally the hard fat from the neck of the pig). It is traditionally flavoured with peppercorns, but modern versions can also contain pistachios or, less commonly, myrtle berries. The sausage is then cooked.

The best-known version of mortadella is PGI, but other varieties are found across Italy, including some made of other meats.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name is debated. One theory derives the name from the Latin word (&#x27;mortar&#x27;), traditionally used in pounding the meat to produce the sausage. This theory, proposed by Giancarlo Susini, professor of ancient history in the University of Bologna, relies on two funerary steles kept in the Archaeological Museum of Bologna, believed to pertain to the same monument, one showing a herd of piglets and the other a mortar and pestle.

Another theory, introduced by Ovidio Montalbani in the 17th century, derives the name from a Roman sausage flavoured with myrtle berries that Romans called or (myrtle sausage). Myrtle was in fact a popular spice before pepper became available to European markets.

==History==

Traditionally, the pork filling was ground to a paste using a large mortar (, ) and pestle.

Mortadella originated in Bologna, the capital of Emilia-Romagna. Anna Del Conte (&quot;The Gastronomy of Italy&quot; 2001) found a sausage mentioned in a document of the official body of meat preservers in Bologna dated 1376 that may be mortadella.

==Varieties==

===In Italy===

* has protected geographical indication (PGI) status under European Union law and is the best known worldwide. The zone of production is extensive; as well as Emilia-Romagna and the neighbouring regions of Piedmont, Lombardy, Veneto, Marche and Tuscany, it includes Lazio and Trentino.
** The American sausage called &quot;bologna&quot; is named after the .
* , produced in Tuscany (Prato), is also defined by an PGI. It is flavoured with pounded garlic and coloured with alchermes.
* , high in the Apennines of northern Lazio, is lightly smoked.
* is made from horse meat in Albano Laziale, Lazio.

===Elsewhere===

====Ibero-American cultures====
Mortadella is very popular in Spain and Portugal, where a variety with pepper and olives is widely consumed, especially in sandwiches. In eastern Spain, the standard mortadella is often referred to as ().

Mortadella is also popular in Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay and Venezuela, due to the Italian immigrants who settled in these countries in the early 20th century. In these countries, it is spelled , and its recipe is quite similar to the traditional Italian, with additional peppercorns. In Peru is known as .

In Brazil, São Paulo has a very popular mortadela sandwich sold in the Municipal Market.

In Puerto Rico, &quot;smoked mortadella&quot; is sometimes confused with commercial salami or with cooked salami because cafeterias, , and restaurants buy the bulk of whole smoked mortadella. While salami may contain pork, beef, veal and small pieces of fat uniformly distributed within the sausage, mortadella has the traditional larger chunks not so uniformly distributed. Its diameter is much larger than that of hard salami and more closely resembles () in size, hence the confusion of some people. It is smaller in diameter than the traditional because the smoking process causes some shrinkage. It is best served at room temperature to bring out its rich flavour.

====Central, Southern and Eastern Europe====
In Romania, a similar cold cut is also known as . In Hungary, a similar product is called and a plain variety called , or . The term is also often used in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, while is used in other territories of the Balkans. It mainly differs from mortadella and similar salami in that garlic is used instead of myrtle and it does not contain pieces of fat, pistachios or olives. The classic Italian is widely sold in supermarkets along the entire Adriatic coast.

In Greece, where there is a smaller version in addition to the regular one, that variety is called or , and in Bulgaria, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and North Macedonia, the product known as is widely eaten.

In Poland, slices are sometimes dipped in batter, fried and served with potatoes and salads as a quicker (and cheaper) alternative to traditional pork cutlets.

====Middle East and North Africa====
In several countries, such as Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Israel, halal or kosher mortadella is sold, which is made from chicken, beef or turkey. The Siniora brand, a Palestinian brand established in Jerusalem in 1920, is the first in the region, a mortadella with sliced olives, pistachios or peppercorn. Lebanese is a famous brand that is sold around the world. The most popular brands in the GCC are Americana Group and Halwani Brothers. It is also popular in Iran, albeit usually made with beef or lamb, and called commonly , from Russian .

====Canada and United States====
A similar commercial sausage product that omits the cubes of pork fat, called &quot;Bologna&quot;, is popular in Canada and the United States. A variety that includes olives and pimentos is called olive loaf.

Mortadella was banned from import into the United States from 1967 to 2000 due to an outbreak of African swine fever in Italy. This ban was a pivotal part of the plot of the 1971 film starring Sophia Loren. The title for the United States release was .

The ban in the United States was lifted due to a veterinary equivalency agreement that allowed countries to export products that had been shown to be disease-free as part of an overall agreement that would allow products deemed safe in the United States to be exported to the European Union.

====Russia and former Soviet Union====
In Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet states, a very similar product is called (, ). However, this product is usually made from a mixture of beef and pork (sometimes beef and lamb or chicken for religious reasons) and does not include pieces of fat or myrtle; mortadella-style sausages with bits of fat are called and . Instead, it is flavoured with just cardamom, sometimes coriander and nutmeg, and also traditionally contains eggs and milk, which are usually absent in traditional mortadella. Unlike mortadella, contains lower amounts of fat and is high in proteins.

The name &quot;doctor&#x27;s sausage&quot; was coined in the Soviet Union in the 1930s to refer to sausages and meat products recommended by doctors to help with undernourishment and stomach problems. During the Soviet era, it was commonly advertised as being nutritious (due to its low-fat content) and remains popular throughout former Soviet states to the present day.

====Southeast Asia====
 or Vietnamese mortadella is sometimes used as an accompaniment to the Vietnamese dish .

<text>Manuel I Komnenos (; 28 November 1118 – 24 September 1180), Latinized as Comnenus, also called Porphyrogenitus (; &quot;born in the purple&quot;), was a Byzantine emperor of the 12th century who reigned over a crucial turning point in the history of Byzantium and the Mediterranean. His reign saw the last flowering of the Komnenian restoration, during which the Byzantine Empire experienced a resurgence of military and economic power and enjoyed a cultural revival.

Eager to restore his empire to its past glories as the great power of the Mediterranean world, Manuel pursued an energetic and ambitious foreign policy. In the process he made alliances with Pope Adrian IV and the resurgent West. He invaded the Norman Kingdom of Sicily, although unsuccessfully, being the last Eastern Roman emperor to attempt reconquests in the western Mediterranean. The passage of the potentially dangerous Second Crusade through his empire was adroitly managed. Manuel established a Byzantine protectorate over the Crusader states of Outremer. Facing Muslim advances in the Holy Land, he made common cause with the Kingdom of Jerusalem and participated in a combined invasion of Fatimid Egypt. Manuel reshaped the political maps of the Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean, placing the kingdoms of Hungary and Outremer under Byzantine hegemony and campaigning aggressively against his neighbours both in the west and in the east.

However, towards the end of his reign, Manuel&#x27;s achievements in the east were compromised by a serious defeat at Myriokephalon, which in large part resulted from his arrogance in attacking a well-defended Seljuk position. Although the Byzantines recovered and Manuel concluded an advantageous peace with Sultan Kilij Arslan II, Myriokephalon proved to be the final, unsuccessful effort by the empire to recover the interior of Anatolia from the Turks.

Called &quot;ho Megas&quot; (, translated as &quot;the Great&quot;) by the Greeks, Manuel is known to have inspired intense loyalty in those who served him. He also appears as the hero of a history written by his secretary, John Kinnamos, in which every virtue is attributed to him. Manuel, who was influenced by his contact with western Crusaders, enjoyed the reputation of &quot;the most blessed emperor of Constantinople&quot; in parts of the Latin world as well. Some historians have been less enthusiastic about him, however, asserting that the great power he wielded was not his own personal achievement, but that of the Komnenos dynasty he represented. Further, it has also been argued that since Byzantine imperial power declined catastrophically after Manuel&#x27;s death, it is only natural to look for the causes of this decline in his reign.

==Accession to the throne==
Born on 28 November 1118, Manuel Komnenos was the fourth son of John II Komnenos and Irene of Hungary, so it seemed very unlikely that he would succeed his father. His maternal grandfather was St. Ladislaus. Manuel favourably impressed his father by his courage and fortitude during the unsuccessful Siege of Neocaesarea (1140), against the Danishmendid Turks. In 1143 John II lay dying as a result of an infected wound; on his deathbed he chose Manuel as his successor, in preference to his elder surviving brother Isaac. John cited Manuel&#x27;s courage and readiness to take advice, in contrast to Isaac&#x27;s irascibility and unbending pride, as the reasons for his choice. After John died on 8 April 1143, his son, Manuel, was acclaimed emperor by the armies. Yet his succession was by no means assured: with his father&#x27;s army in the wilds of Cilicia far from Constantinople, he recognised that it was vital he should return to the capital as soon as possible. He still had to take care of his father&#x27;s funeral, and tradition demanded he organise the foundation of a monastery on the spot where his father died. Swiftly, he dispatched the &quot;megas domestikos&quot; John Axouch ahead of him, with orders to arrest his most dangerous potential rival, his brother Isaac, who was living in the Great Palace with instant access to the imperial treasure and regalia. Axouch arrived in the capital even before news of the emperor&#x27;s death had reached it. He quickly secured the loyalty of the city, and when Manuel entered the capital in August 1143, he was crowned by the new patriarch, Michael II Kourkouas. A few days later, with nothing more to fear as his position as emperor was now secure, Manuel ordered the release of Isaac. Then he ordered two golden pieces to be given to every householder in Constantinople and 200 pounds of gold (including 200 silver pieces annually) to be given to the Byzantine Church.

The empire that Manuel inherited from his father was in a more stable position than it had been a century earlier. In the late 11th century, the Byzantine Empire had faced marked military and political decline, but this decline had been arrested and largely reversed by the leadership of Manuel&#x27;s grandfather and father. Nevertheless, the empire continued to face formidable challenges. At the end of the 11th century, the Normans of Sicily had removed Italy from the control of the Byzantine emperor. The Seljuk Turks had done the same with central Anatolia. And in the Levant, a new force had appeared—the Crusader states—which presented the Byzantine Empire with new challenges. Now, more than at any time during the preceding centuries, the task facing the emperor was daunting indeed.

==Second Crusade and Raynald of Châtillon==
===Prince of Antioch===

The first test of Manuel&#x27;s reign came in 1144, when he was faced with a demand by Raymond, Prince of Antioch, for the cession of Cilician territories. However, later that year the crusader County of Edessa was engulfed by the tide of a resurgent Islamic jihad under Imad ad-Din Zengi. Raymond realized that immediate help from the west was out of the question. With his eastern flank now dangerously exposed to this new threat, there seemed little option but for him to prepare for a humiliating visit to Constantinople. Swallowing his pride, he made the journey north to submit to Manuel and ask for protection. He was promised the support that he had requested, and his allegiance to Byzantium was secured.

===Expedition against Konya===
In 1146 Manuel assembled his army at the military base Lopadion and set out on a punitive expedition against Mas&#x27;ud, the Sultan of Rûm, who had been repeatedly violating the frontiers of the Empire in western Anatolia and Cilicia. There was no attempt at a systematic conquest of territory, but Manuel&#x27;s army defeated the Turks at Acroënus, before capturing and destroying the fortified town of Philomelion, removing its remaining Christian population. The Byzantine forces reached Masud&#x27;s capital, Konya (Iconium), and ravaged the area around the city, but could not assault its walls. Among Manuel&#x27;s motives for mounting this razzia there included a wish to be seen in the West as actively espousing the crusading ideal; Kinnamos also attributed to Manuel a desire to show off his martial prowess to his new bride. While on this campaign Manuel received a letter from Louis VII of France announcing his intention of leading an army to the relief of the crusader states.

===Arrival of the Crusaders===
Manuel was prevented from capitalising on his conquests by events in the Balkans that urgently required his presence. In 1147 he granted a passage through his dominions to two armies of the Second Crusade under Conrad III of Germany and Louis VII of France. At this time, there were still members of the Byzantine court who remembered the passage of the First Crusade, a defining event in the collective memory of the age that had fascinated Manuel&#x27;s aunt, Anna Komnene.

Many Byzantines feared the Crusade, a view endorsed by the numerous acts of vandalism and theft practised by the unruly armies as they marched through Byzantine territory. Byzantine troops followed the Crusaders, attempting to police their behaviour, and further troops were assembled in Constantinople, ready to defend the capital against any acts of aggression. This cautious approach was well advised, but still the numerous incidents of covert and open hostility between the Franks and the Greeks on their line of march, for which it seems both sides were to blame, precipitated conflict between Manuel and his guests. Manuel took the precaution—which his grandfather had not taken—of making repairs to the city walls, and he pressed the two kings for guarantees concerning the security of his territories. Conrad&#x27;s army was the first to enter the Byzantine territory in the summer of 1147, and it figures more prominently in the Byzantine sources, which imply that it was the more troublesome of the two. Indeed, the contemporary Byzantine historian Kinnamos describes a full-scale clash between a Byzantine force and part of Conrad&#x27;s army, outside the walls of Constantinople. The Byzantines defeated the Germans and, in Byzantine eyes, this reverse caused Conrad to agree to have his army speedily ferried across to Damalis on the Asian shore of the Bosphoros.

After 1147, however, the relations between the two leaders became friendlier. By 1148 Manuel had seen the wisdom of securing an alliance with Conrad, whose sister-in-law Bertha of Sulzbach he had earlier married; he actually persuaded the German king to renew their alliance against Roger II of Sicily. Unfortunately for the Byzantine emperor, Conrad died in 1152, and despite repeated attempts, Manuel could not reach an agreement with his successor, Frederick Barbarossa.

===Cyprus invaded===
Manuel&#x27;s attention was again drawn to Antioch in 1156, when Raynald of Châtillon, the new Prince of Antioch, claimed that the Byzantine emperor had reneged on his promise to pay him a sum of money and vowed to attack the Byzantine province of Cyprus. Raynald arrested the governor of the island, John Komnenos, who was a nephew of Manuel, and the general Michael Branas. The Latin historian William of Tyre deplored this act of war against fellow Christians and described the atrocities committed by Raynald&#x27;s men in considerable detail. Having ransacked the island and plundered all its wealth, Raynald&#x27;s army mutilated the survivors before forcing them to buy back their flocks at exorbitant prices with what little they had left. Thus enriched with enough booty to make Antioch wealthy for years, the invaders boarded their ships and set sail for home. Raynald also sent some of the mutilated hostages to Constantinople as a vivid demonstration of his disobedience and his contempt for the Byzantine emperor.

Manuel responded to this outrage in a characteristically energetic way. In the winter of 1158–59, he marched to Cilicia at the head of a huge army; the speed of his advance (Manuel had hurried on ahead of the main army with 500 cavalry) was such that he managed to surprise the Armenian Thoros of Cilicia, who had participated in the attack on Cyprus. Thoros fled into the mountains, and Cilicia swiftly fell to Manuel.

===Manuel in Antioch===
Meanwhile, news of the advance of the Byzantine army soon reached Antioch. Raynald knew that he had no hope of defeating the emperor, and in addition knew that he could not expect any aid from King Baldwin III of Jerusalem. Baldwin did not approve of Raynald&#x27;s attack on Cyprus, and in any case had already made an agreement with Manuel. Thus isolated and abandoned by his allies, Raynald decided that abject submission was his only hope. He appeared dressed in a sack with a rope tied around his neck, and begged for forgiveness. Manuel at first ignored the prostrate Raynald, chatting with his courtiers; William of Tyre commented that this ignominious scene continued for so long that all present were &quot;disgusted&quot; by it. Eventually, Manuel forgave Raynald on condition that he would become a vassal of the Empire, effectively surrendering the independence of Antioch to Byzantium.

Peace having been restored, a grand ceremonial procession was staged on 12 April 1159 for the triumphant entry of the Byzantine army into the city, with Manuel riding through the streets on horseback, while the Prince of Antioch and the King of Jerusalem followed on foot. Manuel dispensed justice to the citizens and presided over games and tournaments for the crowd. In May, at the head of a united Christian army, he started on the road to Edessa, but he abandoned the campaign when he secured the release by Nur ad-Din, the ruler of Syria, of 6,000 Christian prisoners captured in various battles since the second Crusade. Despite the glorious end of the expedition, modern scholars argue that Manuel ultimately achieved much less than he had desired in terms of imperial restoration.

Satisfied with his efforts thus far, Manuel headed back to Constantinople. On their way back, his troops were surprised in line of march by the Turks. Despite this, they won a complete victory, routing the enemy army from the field and inflicting heavy losses. In the following year, Manuel drove the Turks out of Isauria.

==Italian campaign==

===Roger II of Sicily===
In 1147 Manuel was faced with war by Roger II of Sicily, whose fleet had captured the Byzantine island of Corfu and plundered Thebes and Corinth. However, despite being distracted by a Cuman attack in the Balkans, in 1148 Manuel enlisted the alliance of Conrad III of Germany, and the help of the Venetians, who quickly defeated Roger with their powerful fleet. In 1149, Manuel recovered Corfu and prepared to take the offensive against the Normans, while Roger II sent George of Antioch with a fleet of 40 ships to pillage Constantinople&#x27;s suburbs. Manuel had already agreed with Conrad on a joint invasion and partition of southern Italy and Sicily. The renewal of the German alliance remained the principal orientation of Manuel&#x27;s foreign policy for the rest of his reign, despite the gradual divergence of interests between the two empires after Conrad&#x27;s death.

Roger died in February 1154 and was succeeded by William I, who faced widespread rebellions against his rule in Sicily and Apulia, leading to the presence of Apulian refugees at the Byzantine court. Conrad&#x27;s successor, Frederick Barbarossa, launched a campaign against the Normans, but his expedition stalled. These developments encouraged Manuel to take advantage of the multiple instabilities on the Italian peninsula. He sent Michael Palaiologos and John Doukas, both of whom held the high imperial rank of &quot;sebastos&quot;, with Byzantine troops, ten ships and large quantities of gold to invade Apulia in 1155. The two generals were instructed to enlist the support of Frederick, but he declined because his demoralised army longed to get back north of the Alps as soon as possible. Nevertheless, with the help of disaffected local barons, including Count Robert of Loritello, Manuel&#x27;s expedition achieved astonishingly rapid progress as the whole of southern Italy rose up in rebellion against the Sicilian Crown and the untried William I. There followed a string of spectacular successes as numerous strongholds yielded either to force or the lure of gold.

===Papal-Byzantine alliance===
The city of Bari, which had been the capital of the Byzantine Catapanate of Italy for centuries before the arrival of the Normans, opened its gates to the Emperor&#x27;s army, and the overjoyed citizens tore down the Norman citadel. After the fall of Bari, the cities of Trani, Giovinazzo, Andria, Taranto and Brindisi were also captured. William arrived with his army, including 2,000 knights, but was heavily defeated.

Encouraged by the success, Manuel dreamed of restoration of the Roman Empire, at the cost of union between the Orthodox and the Catholic Church, a prospect which would frequently be offered to the Pope during negotiations and plans for alliance. If there was ever a chance of reuniting the eastern and western churches, and coming to reconciliation with the Pope permanently, this was probably the most favourable moment. The Papacy was never on good terms with the Normans, except when under duress by the threat of direct military action. Having the &quot;civilised&quot; Byzantines on its southern border was infinitely preferable to the Papacy than having to constantly deal with the troublesome Normans of Sicily. It was in the interest of Pope Adrian IV to reach a deal if at all possible, since doing so would greatly increase his own influence over the entire Orthodox Christian population. Manuel offered a large sum of money to the Pope for the provision of troops, with the request that the Pope grant the Byzantine emperor lordship of three maritime cities in return for assistance in expelling William from Sicily. Manuel also promised to pay 5,000 pounds of gold to the Pope and the Curia. Negotiations were hurriedly carried out, and an alliance was formed between Manuel and Hadrian.

At this point, just as the war seemed decided in his favour, events turned against Manuel. Byzantine commander Michael Palaiologos alienated allies with his attitude, stalling the campaign as Count Robert III of Loritello refused to speak to him. Although the two were reconciled, the campaign had lost some of its momentum: Michael was soon recalled to Constantinople, and his loss was a major blow to the campaign. The turning point was the Battle of Brindisi, where the Normans launched a major counter-attack by both land and sea. At the approach of the enemy, the mercenaries that had been hired with Manuel&#x27;s gold demanded huge increases in their pay. When this was refused, they deserted. Even the local barons started to melt away, and soon John Doukas was left hopelessly outnumbered. The arrival of Alexios Komnenos Bryennios with some ships failed to retrieve the Byzantine position. The naval battle was decided in favour of the Normans, while John Doukas and Alexios Bryennios (along with four Byzantine ships) were captured. Manuel then sent Alexios Axouch to Ancona to raise another army, but by this time William had already retaken all of the Byzantine conquests in Apulia. The defeat at Brindisi put an end to the restored Byzantine reign in Italy; in 1158 the Byzantine army left Italy and never returned again. Both Nicetas Choniates and Kinnamos, the major Byzantine historians of this period, agree, however, that the peace terms Axouch secured from William allowed Manuel to extricate himself from the war with dignity, despite a devastating raid by a Norman fleet of 164 ships (carrying 10,000 men) on Euboea and Almira in 1156.

===Failure of the Church union===
During the Italian campaign, and afterwards, during the struggle of the Papal Curia with Frederick, Manuel tried to sway the popes with hints of a possible union between the Eastern and Western churches. Although in 1155 Pope Adrian IV had expressed his eagerness to prompt the reunion of the churches, hopes for a lasting Papal-Byzantine alliance came up against insuperable problems. Adrian IV and his successors demanded recognition of their religious authority over all Christians everywhere and sought superiority over the Byzantine emperor; they were not at all willing to fall into a state of dependence from one emperor to the other. Manuel, on the other hand, wanted an official recognition of his secular authority over both East and West. Such conditions would not be accepted by either side. Even if a pro-western emperor such as Manuel agreed, the Greek citizens of the empire would have rejected outright any union of this sort, as they did almost three hundred years later when the Orthodox and Catholic churches were briefly united under the pope. In spite of his friendliness towards the Roman Church and his cordial relations with all the popes, Manuel was never honoured with the title of &quot;augustus&quot; by the popes. And although he twice sent embassies to Pope Alexander III (in 1167 and 1169) offering to reunite the Greek and Latin churches, Alexander refused, under pretext of the troubles that would follow union.

The final results of the Italian campaign were limited in terms of the advantages gained by the Empire. The city of Ancona became a Byzantine base in Italy, accepting Manuel as sovereign. The Normans of Sicily had been damaged and now came to terms with the Empire, ensuring peace for the rest of Manuel&#x27;s reign. The Empire&#x27;s ability to get involved in Italian affairs had been demonstrated. However, given the enormous quantities of gold which had been lavished on the project, it also demonstrated the limits of what money and diplomacy alone could achieve. The expense of Manuel&#x27;s involvement in Italy must have cost the treasury a great deal (probably more than 2.16 million &quot;hyperpyra&quot; or 30,000 pounds of gold), and yet it produced only limited solid gains.

===Byzantine policy in Italy after 1158===
After 1158, under the new conditions, the aims of the Byzantine policy changed. Manuel now decided to oppose the objective of the Hohenstaufen dynasty to directly annex Italy, which Frederick believed should acknowledge his power. When the war between Frederick Barbarossa and the northern Italian communes started, Manuel actively supported the Lombard League with money subsidies, agents, and, occasionally, troops. The walls of Milan, demolished by the Germans, were restored with Manuel&#x27;s aid. Ancona remained important as a centre of Byzantine influence in Italy. The Anconitans made a voluntary submission to Manuel, and the Byzantines maintained representatives in the city. Frederick&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Legnano, on 29 May 1176, seemed rather to improve Manuel&#x27;s position in Italy. According to Kinnamos, Cremona, Pavia and a number of other &quot;Ligurian&quot; cities went over to Manuel; his relations were also particularly favourable in regard to Genoa and Pisa, but not to Venice. In March 1171 Manuel had suddenly broken with Venice, ordering all 20,000 Venetians on imperial territory to be arrested and their property confiscated. Venice, incensed, sent a fleet of 120 ships against Byzantium. Due to an epidemic, and pursued by 150 Byzantine ships, the fleet was forced to return without great success. In all probability, friendly relations between Byzantium and Venice were not restored in Manuel&#x27;s lifetime.

==Balkan frontier==
On his northern frontier Manuel expended considerable effort to preserve the conquests made by Basil II over one hundred years earlier and maintained, sometimes tenuously, ever since. Due to distraction from his neighbours on the Balkan frontier, Manuel was kept from his main objective, the subjugation of the Normans of Sicily. Relations had been good with the Serbs and Hungarians since 1129, so the Serb rebellion came as a shock. The Serbs of Rascia, being so induced by Roger II of Sicily, invaded Byzantine territory in 1149.

Manuel forced the rebellious Serbs, and their leader, Uroš II, to vassalage (1150–1152). He then made repeated attacks upon the Hungarians with a view to annexing their territory along the Sava. In the wars of 1151–1153 and 1163–1168 Manuel led his troops into Hungary and a spectacular raid deep into enemy territory yielded substantial war booty. In 1167, Manuel sent 15,000 men under the command of Andronikos Kontostephanos against the Hungarians, scoring a decisive victory at the Battle of Sirmium and enabling the Empire to conclude a very advantageous peace with the Kingdom of Hungary by which Syrmia, Bosnia and Dalmatia were ceded. By 1168 nearly the whole of the eastern Adriatic coast lay in Manuel&#x27;s hands.

Efforts were also made towards a diplomatic annexation of Hungary. The Hungarian heir Béla, younger brother of the Hungarian king Stephen III, was sent to Constantinople to be educated in the emperor&#x27;s court. Manuel intended the youth to marry his daughter, Maria, and to make him his heir, thus securing the union of Hungary with the Empire. At court Béla assumed the name Alexius and received the title of &quot;despot&quot;, which had previously been applied only to the emperor himself. However, two unforeseen dynastic events drastically altered the situation. In 1169, Manuel&#x27;s young wife gave birth to a son, thus depriving Béla of his status as heir of the Byzantine throne (although Manuel would not renounce the Croatian lands he had taken from Hungary). Then, in 1172, Stephen died childless, and Béla went home to take his throne. Before leaving Constantinople, he swore a solemn oath to Manuel that he would always &quot;keep in mind the interests of the emperor and of the Romans&quot;. Béla III kept his word: as long as Manuel lived, he made no attempt to retrieve his Croatian inheritance, which he only afterwards reincorporated into Hungary.

==Relations with Kievan Rus&#x27; (Russia)==
Manuel Komnenos attempted to draw the Russian principalities into his net of diplomacy directed against Hungary, and to a lesser extent Norman Sicily. This polarised the Russian princes into pro- and anti-Byzantine camps. In the late 1140s three princes were competing for primacy in Russia: prince Iziaslav II of Kiev was related to Géza II of Hungary and was hostile to Byzantium; Prince Yuri Dolgoruki of Suzdal was Manuel&#x27;s ally (&quot;symmachos&quot;), and Vladimirko of Galicia (Principality of Halych) is described as Manuel&#x27;s vassal (&quot;hypospondos&quot;). Galicia was situated on the northern and north-eastern borders of Hungary and, therefore, was of great strategic importance in the Byzantine-Hungarian conflicts. Following the deaths of both Iziaslav and Vladimirko, the situation became reversed; when Yuri of Suzdal, Manuel&#x27;s ally, took over Kiev and Yaroslav, the new ruler of Galicia, adopted a pro-Hungarian stance.

In 1164–65 Manuel&#x27;s cousin Andronikos, the future emperor, escaped from captivity in Byzantium and fled to the court of Yaroslav in Galicia. This situation, holding out the alarming prospect of Andronikos making a bid for Manuel&#x27;s throne sponsored by both Galicia and Hungary, spurred the Byzantines into an unprecedented flurry of diplomacy. Manuel pardoned Andronikos and persuaded him to return to Constantinople in 1165. A mission to Kiev, then ruled by Prince Rostislav, resulted in a favourable treaty and a pledge to supply the Empire with auxiliary troops; Yaroslav of Galicia was also persuaded to renounce his Hungarian connections and return fully into the imperial fold. As late as 1200 the princes of Galicia were providing invaluable services against the enemies of the Empire, at that time the Cumans.

The restoration of relations with Galicia had an immediate benefit for Manuel when, in 1166, he dispatched two armies to attack the eastern provinces of Hungary in a vast pincer movement. One army crossed the Walachian Plain and entered Hungary through the Transylvanian Alps (Southern Carpathians), while the other army made a wide circuit to Galicia and, with Galician aid, crossed the Carpathian Mountains. Since the Hungarians had most of their forces concentrated on the Sirmium and Belgrade frontier, they were caught off guard by the Byzantine invasion; this resulted in the Hungarian province of Transylvania being thoroughly ravaged by the Byzantine armies.

==Invasion of Egypt==

===Alliance with the Kingdom of Jerusalem===
Control of Egypt was a decades-old dream of the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, and its king Amalric I needed all the military and financial support he could get for his planned campaign. Amalric also realised that if he were to pursue his ambitions in Egypt, he might have to leave Antioch to the hegemony of Manuel, who had paid 100,000 dinars for the release of Bohemond III. In 1165, he sent envoys to the Byzantine court to negotiate a marriage alliance (Manuel had already married Amalric&#x27;s cousin Maria of Antioch in 1161). After a long interval of two years, Amalric married Manuel&#x27;s grandniece Maria Komnene in 1167, and &quot;swore all that his brother Baldwin had sworn before.&quot; A formal alliance was negotiated in 1168, whereby the two rulers arranged for a conquest and partition of Egypt, with Manuel taking the coastal area, and Amalric the interior. In the autumn of 1169 Manuel sent a joint expedition with Amalric to Egypt: a Byzantine army and a naval force of 20 large warships, 150 galleys, and 60 transports, under the command of the &quot;megas doux&quot; Andronikos Kontostephanos, joined forces with Amalric at Ascalon. William of Tyre, who negotiated the alliance, was impressed in particular by the large transport ships that were used to transport the cavalry forces of the army.

Although such a long-range attack on a state far from the centre of the Empire may seem extraordinary (the last time the Empire had attempted anything on this scale was the failed invasion of Sicily over one hundred and twenty years earlier), it can be explained in terms of Manuel&#x27;s foreign policy, which was to use the Latins to ensure the survival of the Empire. This focus on the bigger picture of the eastern Mediterranean and even further afield thus led Manuel to intervene in Egypt: it was believed that in the context of the wider struggle between the crusader states and the Islamic powers of the east, control of Egypt would be the deciding factor. It had become clear that the ailing Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt held the key to the fate of the crusader states. If Egypt came out of its isolation and joined forces with the Muslims under Nur ad-Din, the crusader cause was in trouble.

A successful invasion of Egypt would have several further advantages for the Byzantine Empire. Egypt was a rich province, and in the days of the Roman Empire it had supplied much of the grain for Constantinople before it was lost to the Arabs in the 7th century. The revenues that the Empire could have expected to gain from the conquest of Egypt would have been considerable, even if these would have to be shared with the Crusaders. Furthermore, Manuel may have wanted to encourage Amalric&#x27;s plans, not only to deflect the ambitions of the Latins away from Antioch, but also to create new opportunities for joint military ventures that would keep the King of Jerusalem in his debt, and would also allow the Empire to share in territorial gains.

===Failure of the expedition===
The joined forces of Manuel and Amalric laid siege to Damietta on 27 October 1169, but the siege was unsuccessful due to the failure of the Crusaders and the Byzantines to co-operate fully. According to Byzantine forces, Amalric, not wanting to share the profits of victory, dragged out the operation until the emperor&#x27;s men ran short of provisions and were particularly affected by famine; Amalric then launched an assault, which he promptly aborted by negotiating a truce with the defenders. On the other hand, William of Tyre remarked that the Greeks were not entirely blameless. Whatever the truth of the allegations of both sides, when the rains came, both the Latin army and the Byzantine fleet returned home, although half of the Byzantine fleet was lost in a sudden storm.

Despite the bad feelings generated at Damietta, Amalric still refused to abandon his dream of conquering Egypt, and he continued to seek good relations with the Byzantines in the hopes of another joined attack, which never took place. In 1171 Amalric came to Constantinople in person, after Egypt had fallen to Saladin. Manuel was thus able to organise a grand ceremonial reception which both honoured Amalric and underlined his dependence: for the rest of Amalric&#x27;s reign, Jerusalem was a Byzantine satellite, and Manuel was able to act as a protector of the Holy Places, exerting a growing influence in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. In 1177, a fleet of 150 ships was sent by Manuel I to invade Egypt, but returned home after appearing off Acre due to the refusal of Count Philip of Flanders and many important nobles of the Kingdom of Jerusalem to help.

==Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks==
Between 1158 and 1162, a series of Byzantine campaigns against the Seljuk Turks of the Sultanate of Rûm resulted in a treaty favourable to the Empire. According to the agreement, certain frontier regions, including the city of Sebasteia, should be handed over to Manuel in return for some quantity of cash, while it also obliged the Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II to recognize his overlordship. Kilij Arslan II used the peace with Byzantium, and the power vacuum caused by the death in 1174 of Nur ad-Din Zangi the ruler of Syria, to expel the Danishmends from their Anatolian emirates. When the Seljuk sultan refused to cede some of the territory he had taken from the Danishmends to the Byzantines, as he was obliged to do as part of his treaty obligations, Manuel decided that it was time to deal with the Turks once and for all. Therefore, he assembled the full imperial army and marched against the Seljuk capital, Iconium (Konya). Manuel&#x27;s strategy was to prepare the advanced bases of Dorylaeum and Sublaeum, and then to use them to strike as quickly as possible at Iconium.

Yet Manuel&#x27;s army of 35,000 men was large and unwieldy—according to a letter that Manuel sent to King Henry II of England, the advancing column was long. Manuel marched against Iconium via Laodicea, Chonae, Lampe, Celaenae, Choma and Antioch. Just outside the entrance to the pass at Myriokephalon, Manuel was met by Turkish ambassadors, who offered peace on generous terms. Most of Manuel&#x27;s generals and experienced courtiers urged him to accept the offer. The younger and more aggressive members of the court urged Manuel to attack, however, and he took their advice and continued his advance.

Manuel made serious tactical errors, such as failing to properly scout out the route ahead. These failings caused him to lead his forces straight into a classic ambush. On 17 September 1176 Manuel was checked by Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II at the Battle of Myriokephalon (in highlands near the Tzibritze pass), in which his army was ambushed while marching through the narrow mountain pass. The Byzantines were hemmed in by the narrowness of the pass, which allowed the Seljuks to concentrate their attacks on part of the Byzantine army, especially the baggage and siege train, without the rest being able to intervene. The army&#x27;s siege equipment was quickly destroyed, and Manuel was forced to withdraw—without siege engines, the conquest of Iconium was impossible. According to Byzantine sources, Manuel lost his nerve both during and after the battle, fluctuating between extremes of self-delusion and self-abasement; according to William of Tyre, he was never the same again.

The terms by which Kilij Arslan II allowed Manuel and his army to leave were that he should remove his frontier forts and garrisons at Dorylaeum and Sublaeum. Since the Sultan had already failed to keep his side of the earlier treaty of 1162, however, Manuel only ordered the fortifications of Sublaeum to be dismantled, but not the fortifications of Dorylaeum. Nevertheless, defeat at Myriokephalon was an embarrassment for both Manuel personally and also for his empire. The Komnenian emperors had worked hard since the Battle of Manzikert, over a century earlier, to restore the reputation of the empire. Yet because of his overconfidence, Manuel had demonstrated to the world that Byzantium still could not decisively defeat the Seljuks, despite the advances made during the past century. In Western opinion, Myriokephalon cut Manuel down to a humbler size: not that of Emperor of the Romans but that of King of the Greeks.

The defeat at Myriokephalon has often been depicted as a catastrophe in which the entire Byzantine army was destroyed. Manuel himself compared the defeat to Manzikert; it seemed to him that the Byzantine defeat at Myriokephalon complemented the destruction at Manzikert. In reality, although a defeat, it was not particularly costly and did not significantly diminish the fighting ability of the Byzantine army. Most of the casualties were borne by the right wing, largely composed of allied troops commanded by Baldwin of Antioch, and also by the baggage train, which was the main target of the Turkish ambush.

The limited losses inflicted on native Byzantine troops were quickly recovered, and in the following year Manuel&#x27;s forces defeated a force of &quot;picked Turks&quot;. John Komnenos Vatatzes, who was sent by the Emperor to repel the Turkish invasion, not only brought troops from the capital but also was able to gather an army along the way. Vatatzes caught the Turks in an ambush as they were crossing the Meander River; the subsequent Battle of Hyelion and Leimocheir effectively destroyed them as a fighting force. This is an indication that the Byzantine army remained strong and that the defensive program of western Asia Minor was still successful. After the victory on the Meander, Manuel himself advanced with a small army to drive the Turks from Panasium, south of Cotyaeum.

In 1178, however, a Byzantine army retreated after encountering a Turkish force at Charax, allowing the Turks to capture many livestock. The city of Claudiopolis in Bithynia was besieged by the Turks in 1179, forcing Manuel to lead a small cavalry force to save the city, and then, even as late as 1180, the Byzantines succeeded in scoring a victory over the Turks.

The continuous warfare had a serious effect upon Manuel&#x27;s vitality; he declined in health and in 1180 succumbed to a slow fever. Furthermore, like Manzikert, the balance between the two powers began to gradually shift—Manuel never again attacked the Turks, and after his death they began to move further west, deeper into Byzantine territory.

==Doctrinal controversies (1156–1180)==
Three major theological controversies occurred during Manuel&#x27;s reign. In 1156–1157 the question was raised whether Christ had offered Himself as a sacrifice for the sins of the world to the Father and to the Holy Spirit only, or also to the Logos (i.e., to Himself). In the end a synod held at Constantinople in 1157 declared the doctrine of a single sacrifice to the Holy Trinity, producing a formula: &quot;The precious blood of the Only Begotten was offered not only to the Father but also to the Son and the Holy Ghost, the one Godhead&quot;, despite the dissent of Patriarch of Antioch-elect Soterichos Panteugenos, who was subsequently dismissed.

Ten years later, a controversy arose as to whether the saying of Christ, &quot;My Father is greater than I&quot;, referred to his divine nature, to his human nature, or to the union of the two. Demetrius of Lampe, a Byzantine diplomat recently returned from the West, ridiculed the way the verse was interpreted there, that Christ was inferior to his father in his humanity but equal in his divinity. Manuel, on the other hand, perhaps with an eye on the project for Church union, found that the formula made sense, and prevailed over a majority in a synod convened on 2 March 1166 to decide the issue, where he had the support of the patriarch Luke Chrysoberges and later Patriarch Michael III. Those who refused to submit to the synod&#x27;s decisions had their property confiscated or were exiled. The political dimensions of this controversy are apparent from the fact that a leading dissenter from the Emperor&#x27;s doctrine was his nephew Alexios Kontostephanos.

A third controversy sprung up in 1180, when Manuel objected to the formula of solemn abjuration, which was exacted from Muslim converts. One of the more striking anathemas of this abjuration was that directed against the deity worshipped by Muhammad and his followers:

The emperor ordered the deletion of this anathema from the Church&#x27;s catechetical texts, a measure that provoked vehement opposition from both the patriarch and bishops.

==Chivalric narrations==
Manuel is representative of a new kind of Byzantine ruler who was influenced by his contact with western Crusaders. He arranged jousting matches, even participating in them, an unusual and discomforting sight for the Byzantines. Endowed with a fine physique, Manuel has been the subject of exaggeration in the Byzantine sources of his era, where he is presented as a man of great personal courage. According to the story of his exploits, which appear as a model or a copy of the romances of chivalry, such was his strength and exercise in arms that Raymond of Antioch was incapable of wielding his lance and buckler. In a famous tournament, he is said to have entered the lists on a fiery courser, and to have overturned two of the stoutest Italian knights. In one day, he is said to have slain forty Turks with his own hand, and in a battle against the Hungarians he allegedly snatched a banner, and was the first, almost alone, who passed a bridge that separated his army from the enemy. On another occasion, he is said to have cut his way through a squadron of five hundred Turks, without receiving a wound; he had previously posted an ambuscade in a wood and was accompanied only by his brother and Axouch.

==Family==
Manuel had two wives. His first marriage, in 1146, was to Bertha of Sulzbach, a sister-in-law of Conrad III of Germany. She died in 1159. Children:
# Maria Komnene (1152–1182), wife of Renier of Montferrat.
# Anna Komnene (1154–1158).

Manuel&#x27;s second marriage was to Maria of Antioch (nicknamed &quot;Xene&quot;), a daughter of Raymond and Constance of Antioch, in 1161. By this marriage, Manuel had one son:
# Alexios II Komnenos, who succeeded as emperor in 1180.

Manuel had several illegitimate children:

By Theodora Vatatzina:
# Alexios Komnenos (born in the early 1160s), who was recognised as the emperor&#x27;s son, and indeed received a title (&quot;sebastokrator&quot;). He was briefly married to Eirene Komnene, illegitimate daughter of Andronikos I Komnenos, in 1183–1184, and was then blinded by his father-in-law. He lived until at least 1191 and was known personally to Choniates.

By Maria Taronitissa, the wife of John Doukas Komnenos:
# Alexios Komnenos, a &quot;pinkernes&quot; (&quot;cupbearer&quot;), who fled Constantinople in 1184 and was a figurehead of the Norman invasion and the siege of Thessalonica in 1185.

By other lovers:
# A daughter whose name is unknown. She was born around 1150 and married Theodore Maurozomes before 1170. Her son was Manuel Maurozomes, whose daughter married Kaykhusraw I, the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm, and her descendants ruled the sultanate from 1220 to 1246.
# A daughter whose name is unknown, born around 1155. She was the maternal grandmother of the author Demetrios Tornikes.

==Assessments==

===Foreign and military affairs===
As a young man, Manuel had been determined to restore by force of arms the predominance of the Byzantine Empire in the Mediterranean countries. By the time he died in 1180, 37 years had passed since that momentous day in 1143 when, amid the wilds of Cilicia, his father had proclaimed him emperor. These years had seen Manuel involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides. Manuel&#x27;s father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo the damage done by the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath. Thanks to their efforts, the empire Manuel inherited was stronger and better organised than at any time for a century. While it is clear that Manuel used these assets to the full, it is not so clear how much he added to them, and there is room for doubt as to whether he used them to best effect.

Manuel had proven himself to be an energetic emperor who saw possibilities everywhere, and whose optimistic outlook had shaped his approach to foreign policy. However, in spite of his military prowess Manuel achieved but a slight degree of his object of restoring the Byzantine Empire. Retrospectively, some commentators have criticised some of Manuel&#x27;s aims as unrealistic, in particular citing the expeditions he sent to Egypt as proof of dreams of grandeur on an unattainable scale. His greatest military campaign, his grand expedition against the Turkish Sultanate of Iconium, ended in humiliating defeat, and his greatest diplomatic effort apparently collapsed, when Pope Alexander III became reconciled to the German emperor Frederick Barbarossa at the Peace of Venice. Historian Mark C. Bartusis argues that Manuel (and his father as well) tried to rebuild a national army, but his reforms were adequate for neither his ambitions nor his needs; the defeat at Myriokephalon underscored the fundamental weakness of his policies. According to Edward Gibbon, Manuel&#x27;s victories were not productive of any permanent or useful conquest.

His advisors on western church affairs included the Pisan scholar Hugh Eteriano.

===Internal affairs===
Choniates criticised Manuel for raising taxes and pointed to Manuel&#x27;s reign as a period of excess; according to Choniates, the money thus raised was spent lavishly at the cost of his citizens. Whether one reads the Greek encomiastic sources, or the Latin and oriental sources, the impression is consistent with Choniates&#x27; picture of an emperor who spent lavishly in all available ways, rarely economising in one sector in order to develop another. Manuel spared no expense on the army, the navy, diplomacy, ceremonial, palace-building, the Komnenian family, and other seekers of patronage. A significant amount of this expenditure was pure financial loss to the Empire, like the subsidies poured into Italy and the crusader states, and the sums spent on the failed expeditions of 1155–1156, 1169 and 1176.

The problems this created were counterbalanced to some extent by his successes, particularly in the Balkans; Manuel extended the frontiers of his Empire in the Balkan region, ensuring security for the whole of Greece and Bulgaria. Had he been more successful in all his ventures, he would have controlled not only the most productive farmland around the Eastern Mediterranean and Adriatic seas, but also the entire trading facilities of the area. Even if he did not achieve his ambitious goals, his wars against Hungary (1149–1155, 1162–1167) brought him control of the Dalmatian coast, the rich agricultural region of Sirmium, and the Danube trade route from Hungary to the Black Sea. His Balkan expeditions are said to have taken great booty in slaves and livestock; Kinnamos was impressed by the amount of arms taken from the Hungarian dead after the battle of 1167. And even if Manuel&#x27;s wars against the Turks probably realised a net loss, his commanders took livestock and captives on at least two occasions.

This allowed the Western provinces to flourish in an economic revival that had begun in the time of his grandfather Alexios I and continued till the close of the century. Indeed, it has been argued that Byzantium in the 12th century was richer and more prosperous than at any time since the Persian invasion during the reign of Herakleios, some five hundred years earlier. There is good evidence from this period of new construction and new churches, even in remote areas, strongly suggesting that wealth was widespread. Trade was also flourishing; it has been estimated that the population of Constantinople, the biggest commercial centre of the Empire, was between half a million and one million during Manuel&#x27;s reign, making it by far the largest city in Europe. A major source of Manuel&#x27;s wealth was the &quot;kommerkion&quot;, a customs duty levied at Constantinople on all imports and exports. The &quot;kommerkion&quot; was stated to have collected 20,000 &quot;hyperpyra&quot; each day.

Furthermore, Constantinople was undergoing expansion. The cosmopolitan character of the city was being reinforced by the arrival of Italian merchants and Crusaders en route to the Holy Land. The Venetians, the Genoese, and others opened up the ports of the Aegean to commerce, shipping goods from the Crusader kingdoms of Outremer and Fatimid Egypt to the west and trading with Byzantium via Constantinople. These maritime traders stimulated demand in the towns and cities of Greece, Macedonia, and the Greek Islands, generating new sources of wealth in a predominantly agrarian economy. Thessalonica, the second city of the Empire, hosted a famous summer fair that attracted traders from across the Balkans and even further afield to its bustling market stalls. In Corinth, silk production fuelled a thriving economy. All this is a testament to the success of the Komnenian Emperors in securing a &quot;Pax Byzantina&quot; in these heartland territories.

===Legacy===
To the rhetors of his court, Manuel was the &quot;divine emperor&quot;. A generation after his death, Choniates referred to him as &quot;the most blessed among emperors&quot;, and a century later John Stavrakios described him as &quot;great in fine deeds&quot;. John Phokas, a soldier who fought in Manuel&#x27;s army, characterised him some years later as the &quot;world saving&quot; and glorious emperor. Manuel would be remembered in France, Italy, and the Crusader states as the most powerful sovereign in the world. A Genoese analyst noted that with the passing of &quot;Lord Manuel of divine memory, the most blessed emperor of Constantinople ... all Christendom incurred great ruin and detriment.&quot; William of Tyre called Manuel &quot;a wise and discreet prince of great magnificence, worthy of praise in every respect&quot;, &quot;a great-souled man of incomparable energy&quot;, whose &quot;memory will ever be held in benediction.&quot; Manuel was further extolled by Robert of Clari as &quot;a right worthy man, [...] and richest of all the Christians who ever were, and the most bountiful.&quot;

A telling reminder of the influence that Manuel held in the Crusader states in particular can still be seen in the church of the Holy Nativity in Bethlehem. In the 1160s the nave was redecorated with mosaics showing the councils of the church. Manuel was one of the patrons of the work. On the south wall, an inscription in Greek reads: &quot;the present work was finished by Ephraim the monk, painter and mosaicist, in the reign of the great emperor Manuel Porphyrogennetos Komnenos and in the time of the great king of Jerusalem, Amalric.&quot; That Manuel&#x27;s name was placed first was a symbolic, public recognition of Manuel&#x27;s overlordship as leader of the Christian world. Manuel&#x27;s role as protector of the Orthodox Christians and Christian holy places in general is also evident in his successful attempts to secure rights over the Holy Land. Manuel participated in the building and decorating of many of the basilicas and Greek monasteries in the Holy Land, including the church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, where thanks to his efforts the Byzantine clergy were allowed to perform the Greek liturgy each day. All this reinforced his position as overlord of the Crusader states, with his hegemony over Antioch and Jerusalem secured by agreement with Raynald, Prince of Antioch, and Amalric, King of Jerusalem respectively. Manuel was also the last Byzantine emperor who, thanks to his military and diplomatic success in the Balkans, could call himself &quot;ruler of Dalmatia, Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria and Hungary&quot;.

Manuel died on 24 September 1180, having just celebrated the betrothal of his son Alexios II to the daughter of the king of France. He was laid to rest alongside his father in the Pantokrator Monastery in Constantinople. Thanks to the diplomacy and campaigning of Alexios, John and Manuel, the empire was a great power, economically prosperous, and secure on its frontiers; but there were serious problems as well. Internally, the Byzantine court required a strong leader to hold it together, and after Manuel&#x27;s death stability was seriously endangered from within. Some of the foreign enemies of the Empire were lurking on the flanks, waiting for a chance to attack, in particular the Turks in Anatolia, whom Manuel had ultimately failed to defeat, and the Normans in Sicily, who had already tried but failed to invade the Empire on several occasions. Even the Venetians, the single most important western ally of Byzantium, were on bad terms with the empire at Manuel&#x27;s death in 1180. Given this situation, it would have taken a strong emperor to secure the Empire against the foreign threats it now faced, and to rebuild the depleted imperial treasury. But Manuel&#x27;s son was a minor, and his unpopular regency government was overthrown in a violent &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. This troubled succession weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely.

<text>In the philosophy of language and linguistics, a speech act is something expressed by an individual that not only presents information but performs an action as well. For example, the phrase &quot;I would like the mashed potatoes; could you please pass them to me?&quot; is considered a speech act as it expresses the speaker&#x27;s desire to acquire the mashed potatoes, as well as presenting a request that someone pass the potatoes to them. 

According to Kent Bach, &quot;almost any speech act is really the performance of several acts at once, distinguished by different aspects of the speaker&#x27;s intention: there is the act of saying something, what one does in saying it, such as requesting or promising, and how one is trying to affect one&#x27;s audience&quot;. 

The contemporary use of the term &quot;speech act&quot; goes back to J. L. Austin&#x27;s development of performative utterances and his theory of locutionary, illocutionary, and perlocutionary acts. Speech acts serve their function once they are said or communicated. These are commonly taken to include acts such as apologizing, promising, ordering, answering, requesting, complaining, warning, inviting, refusing, and congratulating.

==History==
For much of the history of the positivist philosophy of language, language was viewed primarily as a way of making factual assertions, and the other uses of language tended to be ignored, as Austin states at the beginning of Lecture 1, &quot;It was for too long the assumption of philosophers that the business of a &#x27;statement&#x27; can only be to &#x27;describe&#x27; some state of affairs, or to &#x27;state some fact&#x27;, which it must do either truly or falsely.&quot; Wittgenstein came up with the idea of &quot;don&#x27;t ask for the meaning, ask for the use,&quot; showing language as a new vehicle for social activity. Speech act theory hails from Wittgenstein&#x27;s philosophical theories. Wittgenstein believed meaning derives from pragmatic tradition, demonstrating the importance of how language is used to accomplish objectives within specific situations. By following rules to accomplish a goal, communication becomes a set of language games. Thus, utterances do more than reflect a meaning, they are words designed to get things done. The work of J. L. Austin, particularly his &quot;How to Do Things with Words&quot;, led philosophers to pay more attention to the non-declarative uses of language. The terminology he introduced, especially the notions &quot;locutionary act&quot;, &quot;illocutionary act&quot;, and &quot;perlocutionary act&quot;, occupied an important role in what was then to become the &quot;study of speech acts&quot;. All of these three acts, but especially the &quot;illocutionary act&quot;, are nowadays commonly classified as &quot;speech acts&quot;.

Austin was by no means the first one to deal with what one could call &quot;speech acts&quot; in a wider sense. The term &#x27;social act&#x27; and some of the theory of this type of linguistic action are to be found in the fifth of Thomas Reid&#x27;s &quot;Essays on the Active Powers of the Human Mind&quot; (1788, chapter VI, Of the Nature of a Contract).

Adolf Reinach (1883–1917) and Stanislav Škrabec (1844–1918) have been both independently credited with a fairly comprehensive account of social acts as performative utterances dating to 1913, long before Austin and Searle.

The term &quot;Speech Act&quot; had also been already used by Karl Bühler.

==Overview==

Speech acts can be analysed on multiple levels:

# A locutionary act: the performance of an utterance: the actual utterance and its apparent meaning, comprising any and all of its verbal, social, and rhetorical meanings, all of which correspond to the verbal, syntactic and semantic aspects of any meaningful utterance;
# an illocutionary act: the active result of the implied request or meaning presented by the locutionary act. For example, if the locutionary act in an interaction is the question &quot;Is there any salt?&quot; the implied illocutionary request is &quot;Please pass the salt to me.&quot; or at least &quot;I wish to add salt to my meal.&quot;;
# and under certain conditions a further perlocutionary act: the actual effect of the locutionary and illocutionary acts, such as persuading, convincing, scaring, enlightening, inspiring, or otherwise getting someone to do or realize something, whether intended or not.
# Additionally, a metalocutionary act categorizes speech acts that refer to the forms and functions of the discourse itself rather than continuing the substantive development of the discourse, or to the configurational functions of prosody and punctuation.

===Illocutionary acts===
The concept of an illocutionary act is central to the concept of a speech act. Although there are several scholarly opinions regarding how to define &#x27;illocutionary acts&#x27;, there are some kinds of acts that are widely accepted as illocutionary. Examples of these widely accepted acts are commands or promises.

The first of these opinions is the one held by John L. Austin who coined the term &quot;speech act&quot; in his book &quot;How to Do Things with Words&quot; published posthumously in 1962. According to Austin&#x27;s preliminary informal description, the idea of an &quot;illocutionary act&quot; can be captured by emphasizing that &quot;by saying something, we &quot;do&quot; something&quot;, as when someone issues an order to someone to go by saying &quot;Go!&quot;, or when a minister joins two people in marriage saying, &quot;I now pronounce you husband and wife.&quot; (Austin would eventually define the &quot;illocutionary act&quot; in a more exact manner.)

John R. Searle gave an alternative to Austin&#x27;s explanation of the illocutionary act saying, a &quot;speech act&quot; is often meant to refer to exactly the same thing as the term illocutionary act. Searle&#x27;s work on speech acts is understood to further refine Austin&#x27;s conception. However, some philosophers have pointed out a significant difference between the two conceptions: whereas Austin emphasized the conventional interpretation of speech acts, Searle emphasized a psychological interpretation (based on beliefs, intentions, etc.).

=== Perlocutionary acts ===
While illocutionary acts relate more to the speaker, perlocutionary acts are centered around the listener. Perlocutionary acts always have a &#x27;perlocutionary effect&#x27;, which is the effect a speech act has on a listener. This could affect the listener&#x27;s thoughts, emotions or even their physical actions. An example of this could be if someone uttered the sentence &quot;I&#x27;m hungry.&quot; The perlocutionary effect on the listener could be the effect of being persuaded by the utterance. For example, after hearing the utterance, the listener could be persuaded to make a sandwich for the speaker.

===Performative speech acts===
An interesting type of illocutionary speech act is that performed in the utterance of what Austin calls performative utterances, typical instances of which are &quot;I nominate John to be President&quot;, &quot;I sentence you to ten years&#x27; imprisonment&quot;, or &quot;I promise to pay you back.&quot; In these typical, rather explicit cases of performative sentences, the action that the sentence describes (nominating, sentencing, promising) is performed by the utterance of the sentence itself. J.L. Austin claimed that performative sentences could be &quot;happy or unhappy&quot;. They were only happy if the speaker does the actions he or she talks about. They were unhappy if this did not happen. Performative speech acts also use explicit verbs instead of implicit ones. For example, stating &quot;I intend to go.&quot; does convey information, but it does not really mean that you are [e.g.] &quot;promising&quot; to go; so it does not count as &quot;performing&quot; an action (&quot;such as&quot; the action of promising to go). Therefore, it [the word &quot;intend&quot;] is an implicit verb; i.e., a verb that would not be suitable for use in performative speech acts.

===Indirect speech acts===

In the course of performing speech acts people communicate with each other. The content of communication may be identical, or almost identical, with the content intended to be communicated, as when a stranger asks, &quot;What is your name?&quot; However, the meaning of the linguistic means used may also be different from the content intended to be communicated. One may, in appropriate circumstances, request Peter to do the dishes by just saying, &quot;Peter ...!&quot;, or one can promise to do the dishes by saying, &quot;Me!&quot;

One common way of performing speech acts is to use an expression, which indicates one speech act, and indeed performs this act, but also performs a further speech act, which is indirect. One may, for instance, say, &quot;Peter, can you close the window?&quot;, thereby asking Peter whether he will be able to close the window, but also requesting that he does so. Since the request is performed indirectly, by means of (directly) performing a question, it counts as an indirect speech act.

An even more indirect way of making such a request would be to say, in Peter&#x27;s presence in the room with the open window, &quot;I&#x27;m cold.&quot; The speaker of this request must rely upon Peter&#x27;s understanding of several items of information that is not explicit: that the window is open and is the cause of them being cold, that being cold is an uncomfortable sensation and they wish it to be taken care of, and that Peter cares to rectify this situation by closing the window. This, of course, depends much on the relationship between the requester and Peter—he might understand the request differently if they were his boss at work than if they were his girlfriend or boyfriend at home. The more presumed information pertaining to the request, the more indirect the speech act may be considered to be.

Indirect speech acts are commonly used to reject proposals and to make requests. For example, if a speaker asks, &quot;Would you like to meet me for coffee?&quot; and the other replies, &quot;I have class&quot;, the second speaker has used an indirect speech act to reject the proposal. This is indirect because the literal meaning of &quot;I have class&quot; does not entail any sort of rejection.

This poses a problem for linguists, as it is confusing to see how the person who made the proposal can understand that his proposal was rejected. In 1975 John Searle suggested that the illocutionary force of indirect speech acts can be derived by means of a Gricean reasoning process; however, the process he proposes does not seem to accurately solve the problem .

In other words, this means that one does not need to say the words apologize, pledge, or praise in order to show they are doing the action. All the examples above show how the actions and indirect words make something happen rather than coming out straightforward with specific words and saying it.

==Examples==
Speech Acts are commonplace in everyday interactions and are important for communication, as well as present in many different contexts. Examples of these include:
*&quot;You&#x27;re fired!&quot; expresses both the employment status of the individual in question, as well as the action by which said person&#x27;s employment is ended.
*&quot;I hereby appoint you as chairman&quot; expresses both the status of the individual as chairman, and the action that promotes the individual to this position.
*&quot;We ask that you extinguish your cigarettes at this time, and bring your tray tables and seatbacks to an upright position.&quot; This statement describes the requirements of the current location, such as an aeroplane, while also issuing the command to stop smoking and to sit up straight.
*&quot;Would it be too much trouble for me to ask you to hand me that wrench?&quot; functions to simultaneously ask two questions. The first is to ask the listener if they are capable of passing the wrench, while the second is an actual request. 
*&quot;Well, would you listen to that?&quot; acts as a question, requesting that a listener heed what is being said by the speaker, but also as an exclamation of disbelief or shock.

==In language development==
In 1975 John Dore proposed that children&#x27;s utterances were realizations of one of nine primitive speech acts:
#labelling
#repeating
#answering
#requesting (action)
#requesting (answer)
#calling
#greeting
#protesting
#practicing

==Formalization==

There is no agreed formalization of Speech Act theory. In 1985, John Searle and D. Vandervecken attempted to give some grounds of an illocutionary logic. Other attempts have been proposed by Per Martin-Löf for a treatment of the concept of assertion inside intuitionistic type theory, and by Carlo Dalla Pozza, with a proposal of a formal pragmatics connecting propositional content (given with classical semantics) and illocutionary force (given by intuitionistic semantics). Up to now the main basic formal applications of speech act theory are to be found in the field of human–computer interaction in chatboxes and other tools. Recent work in artificial intelligence proposes a Bayesian approach to formalize speech acts 

==In computer science==

In 1991, computational speech act models of human–computer conversation were developed, and in 2004 speech act theory has been used to model conversations for automated classification and retrieval.

=== &quot;Conversation for action&quot; ===

Another highly-influential view of Speech Acts has been in the &quot;conversation for action&quot; developed by Terry Winograd and Fernando Flores in their 1986 text &quot;Understanding Computers and Cognition: A New Foundation for Design&quot;. Arguably the most important part of their analysis lies in a state-transition diagram in Chapter 5, that Winograd and Flores claim underlies the significant illocutionary (speech act) claims of two parties attempting to coordinate action with one another, no matter whether the agents involved might be human–human, human–computer, or computer–computer.

A key part of this analysis is the contention that one dimension of the social domain-tracking the illocutionary status of the transaction (whether individual participants claim that their interests have been met, or not) is very readily conferred to a computer process, regardless of whether the computer has the means to adequately represent the real world issues underlying that claim. Thus a computer instantiating the conversation for action has the useful ability to model the status of the current social reality independent of any external reality on which social claims may be based.

This transactional view of speech acts has significant applications in many areas in which (human) individuals have had different roles, for instance, a patient and a physician might meet in an encounter in which the patient makes a request for treatment, the physician responds with a counter-offer involving a treatment they feel is appropriate, and the patient might respond, etc. Such a conversation for action can describe a situation in which an external observer (such as a computer or health information system) may be able to track the &quot;illocutionary&quot; (or speech act) &quot;status&quot; of negotiations between the patient and physician participants even in the absence of any adequate model of the illness or proposed treatments. The key insight provided by Winograd and Flores is that the state-transition diagram representing the &quot;social&quot; (Illocutionary) negotiation of the two parties involved is generally much, much simpler than any model representing the world in which those parties are making claims; in short, the system tracking the status of the conversation for action need not be concerned with modeling all of the realities of the external world. A conversation for action is critically dependent upon certain stereotypical &quot;claims&quot; about the status of the world made by the two parties. Thus a conversation for action can be readily tracked and facilitated by a device with little or no ability to model circumstances in the real world other than the ability to register claims by specific agents about a domain.

===Rules===
In the past, philosophy has discussed rules for when expressions are used. The two rules are &quot;constitutive&quot; and &quot;regulative rules&quot;.

The concept of constitutive rules finds its origin in Wittgenstein and John Rawls, and has been elaborated by G.C.J. Midgley, Max Black, G.H. von Wright, David Shwayder, and John Searle.

Whereas &quot;regulative rules&quot; are prescriptions that regulate a pre-existing activity (whose existence is logically independent of the rules), &quot;constitutive rules&quot; constitute an activity the existence of which is logically dependent on the rules.

For example: traffic rules are &quot;regulative rules&quot; that prescribe certain behaviour in order to regulate the traffic. Without these rules however, the traffic would not cease to be. In contrast: the rules of chess are &quot;constitutive rules&quot; that constitute the game. Without these rules chess would not exist, since the game is logically dependent on the rules.

=== In multiagent universes ===

Multi-agent systems sometimes use speech act labels to express the intent of an agent when it sends a message to another agent. For example, the intent &quot;inform&quot; in the message &quot;inform(content)&quot; may be interpreted as a request that the receiving agent adds the item &quot;content&quot; to its knowledge-base; this is in contrast to the message &quot;query(content)&quot;, which may be interpreted (depending on the semantics employed) as a request to see if the item content is currently in the receiving agents knowledge base. There are at least two standardisations of speech act labelled messaging KQML and FIPA.

KQML and FIPA are based on the Searlian, that is, psychological semantics of speech acts. Munindar P. Singh has long advocated moving away from the psychological to a social semantics of speech acts—one that would be in tune with Austin&#x27;s conception. Andrew Jones has also been a critic of the psychological conception. A recent collection of manifestos by researchers in agent communication reflects a growing recognition in the multiagent systems community of the benefits of a social semantics.

=== Other uses in technology ===

* An office can be seen as a system of speech acts. The abbreviation SAMPO stands for Speech-Act-based office Modeling approach, which &quot;studies office activities as a series of speech acts creating, maintaining, modifying, reporting, and terminating commitments&quot;.
* Speech act profiling has been used to detect deception in synchronous computer-mediated communication.

==In political science==
In political science, the Copenhagen School adopts speech act as a form of felicitous speech act (or simply &#x27;facilitating conditions&#x27;), whereby the speaker, often politicians or players, act in accordance to the truth but in preparation for the audience to take action in the directions of the player that are driven or incited by the act. This forms an observable framework under a specified subject matter from the player, and the audience who are &#x27;under-theorised [would] remain outside of the framework itself, and would benefit from being both brought in and drawn out.&#x27; It is because the audience would not be informed of the intentions of the player, except to focus on the display of the speech act itself. Therefore, in the perspective of the player, the truth of the subject matter is irrelevant except the result produced via the audience.

The study of speech acts is prevalent in legal theory since laws themselves can be interpreted as speech acts. Laws issue out a command to their constituents, which can be realized as an action. When forming a legal contract, speech acts can be made when people are making or accepting an offer. Considering the theory of freedom of speech, some speech acts may not be legally protected. For example, a death threat is a type of speech act and is considered to exist outside of the protection of freedom of speech as it is treated as a criminal act.

==In economic sociology==
In a sociological perspective, Nicolas Brisset adopts the concept of speech act in order to understand how economic models participate in the making and the spreading of representations inside and outside of the scientific field. Brisset argues that models perform actions in different fields (scientific, academic, practical, and political). This multiplicity of fields induces a variety of felicity conditions and types of performed actions. This perspective is a criticism of the essentialism of philosophical modelling studies. This approach is largely inspired by the work of Pierre Bourdieu and Quentin Skinner.

In finance, it is possible to understand mathematical models as speech acts: in 2016 the notion of &quot;financial Logos&quot; was defined as the speech act of mathematical modelling of financial risks. The action of the financial Logos on financial practices is the framing of financial decision-making by risk modelling.

<text>In mathematics, the limit inferior and limit superior of a sequence can be thought of as limiting (that is, eventual and extreme) bounds on the sequence. They can be thought of in a similar fashion for a function (see limit of a function). For a set, they are the infimum and supremum of the set&#x27;s limit points, respectively. In general, when there are multiple objects around which a sequence, function, or set accumulates, the inferior and superior limits extract the smallest and largest of them; the type of object and the measure of size is context-dependent, but the notion of extreme limits is invariant. 
Limit inferior is also called infimum limit, limit infimum, liminf, inferior limit, lower limit, or inner limit; limit superior is also known as supremum limit, limit supremum, limsup, superior limit, upper limit, or outer limit.

The limit inferior of a sequence formula_1 is denoted by
formula_2
and the limit superior of a sequence formula_1 is denoted by
formula_4

==Definition for sequences==
The of a sequence (&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is defined by
formula_5
or
formula_6

Similarly, the of (&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is defined by
formula_7
or
formula_8

Alternatively, the notations formula_9 and formula_10 are sometimes used.

The limits superior and inferior can equivalently be defined using the concept of subsequential limits of the sequence formula_1. An element formula_12 of the extended real numbers formula_13 is a &quot;subsequential limit&quot; of formula_1 if there exists a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers formula_15 such that formula_16. If formula_17 is the set of all subsequential limits of formula_1, then 
:formula_19 
and 
:formula_20

If the terms in the sequence are real numbers, the limit superior and limit inferior always exist, as the real numbers together with ±∞ (i.e. the extended real number line) are complete. More generally, these definitions make sense in any partially ordered set, provided the suprema and infima exist, such as in a complete lattice.

Whenever the ordinary limit exists, the limit inferior and limit superior are both equal to it; therefore, each can be considered a generalization of the ordinary limit which is primarily interesting in cases where the limit does &quot;not&quot; exist. Whenever lim inf &quot;xn&quot; and lim sup &quot;xn&quot; both exist, we have

:formula_21

The limits inferior and superior are related to big-O notation in that they bound a sequence only &quot;in the limit&quot;; the sequence may exceed the bound. However, with big-O notation the sequence can only exceed the bound in a finite prefix of the sequence, whereas the limit superior of a sequence like e−&quot;n&quot; may actually be less than all elements of the sequence. The only promise made is that some tail of the sequence can be bounded above by the limit superior plus an arbitrarily small positive constant, and bounded below by the limit inferior minus an arbitrarily small positive constant.

The limit superior and limit inferior of a sequence are a special case of those of a function (see below).

== The case of sequences of real numbers ==

In mathematical analysis, limit superior and limit inferior are important tools for studying sequences of real numbers. Since the supremum and infimum of an unbounded set of real numbers may not exist (the reals are not a complete lattice), it is convenient to consider sequences in the affinely extended real number system: we add the positive and negative infinities to the real line to give the complete totally ordered set [−∞,∞], which is a complete lattice.

=== Interpretation ===

Consider a sequence formula_1 consisting of real numbers. Assume that the limit superior and limit inferior are real numbers (so, not infinite).
* The limit superior of formula_23 is the smallest real number formula_24 such that, for any positive real number formula_25, there exists a natural number formula_26 such that formula_27. In other words, any number larger than the limit superior is an eventual upper bound for the sequence. Only a finite number of elements of the sequence are greater than formula_28.
* The limit inferior of formula_23 is the largest real number formula_24 such that, for any positive real number formula_25, there exists a natural number formula_26 such that formula_33 for all formula_34. In other words, any number below the limit inferior is an eventual lower bound for the sequence. Only a finite number of elements of the sequence are less than formula_35.

=== Properties ===

The relationship of limit inferior and limit superior for sequences of real numbers is as follows:
formula_36

As mentioned earlier, it is convenient to extend formula_37 to formula_38 Then, formula_39 in formula_40 converges if and only if
formula_41
in which case formula_42 is equal to their common value. (Note that when working just in formula_43 convergence to formula_44 or formula_45 would not be considered as convergence.) Since the limit inferior is at most the limit superior, the following conditions hold formula_46

If formula_47 and formula_48, then the interval formula_49 need not contain any of the numbers formula_50 but every slight enlargement formula_51 for arbitrarily small formula_52 will contain formula_23 for all but finitely many indices formula_54 In fact, the interval formula_49 is the smallest closed interval with this property. We can formalize this property like this: there exist subsequences formula_56 and formula_57 of formula_23 (where formula_59 and formula_60 are increasing) for which we have formula_61

On the other hand, there exists a formula_62 so that for all formula_63 formula_64

To recapitulate:

* If formula_65 is greater than the limit superior, there are at most finitely many formula_23 greater than formula_67 if it is less, there are infinitely many.
* If formula_68 is less than the limit inferior, there are at most finitely many formula_23 less than formula_70 if it is greater, there are infinitely many.

Conversely, it can also be shown that: 

* If there are infinitely many formula_23 greater than or equal to formula_65, then formula_65 is lesser than or equal to the limit supremum; if there are only finitely many formula_23 greater than formula_65, then formula_65 is greater than or equal to the limit supremum.
* If there are infinitely many formula_23 lesser than or equal to formula_68, then formula_68 is greater than or equal to the limit inferior; if there are only finitely many formula_23 lesser than formula_68, then formula_68 is lesser than or equal to the limit inferior.

In general,formula_83The liminf and limsup of a sequence are respectively the smallest and greatest cluster points. 
* For any two sequences of real numbers formula_84 the limit superior satisfies subadditivity whenever the right side of the inequality is defined (that is, not formula_85 or formula_86): formula_87

Analogously, the limit inferior satisfies superadditivity:formula_88In the particular case that one of the sequences actually converges, say formula_89 then the inequalities above become equalities (with formula_90 or formula_91 being replaced by formula_92). 

* For any two sequences of non-negative real numbers formula_84 the inequalities formula_94 and formula_95
hold whenever the right-hand side is not of the form formula_96

If formula_97 exists (including the case formula_98) and formula_99 then formula_100 provided that formula_101 is not of the form formula_96

==== Examples ====

* As an example, consider the sequence given by the sine function: formula_103 Using the fact that π is irrational, it follows that formula_104 and formula_105 (This is because the sequence formula_106 is equidistributed mod 2π, a consequence of the equidistribution theorem.)

* An example from number theory is formula_107 where formula_108 is the formula_109-th prime number.
: The value of this limit inferior is conjectured to be 2 – this is the twin prime conjecture – but has only been proven to be less than or equal to 246. The corresponding limit superior is formula_110, because there are arbitrarily large gaps between consecutive primes.

== Real-valued functions ==

Assume that a function is defined from a subset of the real numbers to the real numbers. As in the case for sequences, the limit inferior and limit superior are always well-defined if we allow the values +∞ and −∞; in fact, if both agree then the limit exists and is equal to their common value (again possibly including the infinities). For example, given formula_111, we have formula_112 and formula_113. The difference between the two is a rough measure of how &quot;wildly&quot; the function oscillates, and in observation of this fact, it is called the oscillation of &quot;f&quot; at 0. This idea of oscillation is sufficient to, for example, characterize Riemann-integrable functions as continuous except on a set of measure zero. Note that points of nonzero oscillation (i.e., points at which &quot;f&quot; is &quot;badly behaved&quot;) are discontinuities which, unless they make up a set of zero, are confined to a negligible set.

== Functions from topological spaces to complete lattices ==

=== Functions from metric spaces ===

There is a notion of limsup and liminf for functions defined on a metric space whose relationship to limits of real-valued functions mirrors that of the relation between the limsup, liminf, and the limit of a real sequence. Take a metric space formula_114, a subspace formula_115 contained in formula_114, and a function formula_117. Define, for any limit point formula_92 of formula_115,

formula_120
and

formula_121

where formula_122 denotes the metric ball of radius formula_25 about formula_92.

Note that as &quot;ε&quot; shrinks, the supremum of the function over the ball is non-increasing (strictly decreasing or remaining the same), so we have

formula_125
and similarly
formula_126

=== Functions from topological spaces ===

This finally motivates the definitions for general topological spaces. Take &quot;X&quot;, &quot;E&quot; and &quot;a&quot; as before, but now let &quot;X&quot; be a topological space. In this case, we replace metric balls with neighborhoods:

:formula_127
:formula_128

(there is a way to write the formula using &quot;lim&quot; using nets and the neighborhood filter). This version is often useful in discussions of semi-continuity which crop up in analysis quite often. An interesting note is that this version subsumes the sequential version by considering sequences as functions from the natural numbers as a topological subspace of the extended real line, into the space (the closure of N in [−∞,∞], the extended real number line, is N ∪ {∞}.)

== Sequences of sets ==

The power set ℘(&quot;X&quot;) of a set &quot;X&quot; is a complete lattice that is ordered by set inclusion, and so the supremum and infimum of any set of subsets (in terms of set inclusion) always exist. In particular, every subset &quot;Y&quot; of &quot;X&quot; is bounded above by &quot;X&quot; and below by the empty set ∅ because ∅ ⊆ &quot;Y&quot; ⊆ &quot;X&quot;. Hence, it is possible (and sometimes useful) to consider superior and inferior limits of sequences in ℘(&quot;X&quot;) (i.e., sequences of subsets of &quot;X&quot;).

There are two common ways to define the limit of sequences of sets. In both cases:
* The sequence &quot;accumulates&quot; around sets of points rather than single points themselves. That is, because each element of the sequence is itself a set, there exist accumulation &quot;sets&quot; that are somehow nearby to infinitely many elements of the sequence.
* The supremum/superior/outer limit is a set that joins these accumulation sets together. That is, it is the union of all of the accumulation sets. When ordering by set inclusion, the supremum limit is the least upper bound on the set of accumulation points because it &quot;contains&quot; each of them. Hence, it is the supremum of the limit points.
* The infimum/inferior/inner limit is a set where all of these accumulation sets meet. That is, it is the intersection of all of the accumulation sets. When ordering by set inclusion, the infimum limit is the greatest lower bound on the set of accumulation points because it is &quot;contained in&quot; each of them. Hence, it is the infimum of the limit points.
* Because ordering is by set inclusion, then the outer limit will always contain the inner limit (i.e., lim inf &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; ⊆ lim sup &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;). Hence, when considering the convergence of a sequence of sets, it generally suffices to consider the convergence of the outer limit of that sequence.
The difference between the two definitions involves how the topology (i.e., how to quantify separation) is defined. In fact, the second definition is identical to the first when the discrete metric is used to induce the topology on &quot;X&quot;.

===General set convergence===

A sequence of sets in a metrizable space formula_114 approaches a limiting set when the elements of each member of the sequence approach the elements of the limiting set. In particular, if formula_130 is a sequence of subsets of formula_131 then:
* formula_132 which is also called the outer limit, consists of those elements which are limits of points in formula_133 taken from (countably) infinitely many formula_54 That is, formula_135 if and only if there exists a sequence of points formula_136 and a formula_137 of formula_130 such that formula_139 and formula_140
* formula_141 which is also called the inner limit, consists of those elements which are limits of points in formula_133 for all but finitely many formula_109 (that is, cofinitely many formula_109). That is, formula_145 if and only if there exists a of points formula_136 such that formula_147 and formula_140
The limit formula_149 exists if and only if formula_150 and formula_151 agree, in which case formula_152 The outer and inner limits should not be confused with the set-theoretic limits superior and inferior, as the latter sets are not sensitive to the topological structure of the space.

===Special case: discrete metric===
This is the definition used in measure theory and probability. Further discussion and examples from the set-theoretic point of view, as opposed to the topological point of view discussed below, are at set-theoretic limit.

By this definition, a sequence of sets approaches a limiting set when the limiting set includes elements which are in all except finitely many sets of the sequence &quot;and&quot; does not include elements which are in all except finitely many complements of sets of the sequence. That is, this case specializes the general definition when the topology on set &quot;X&quot; is induced from the discrete metric.

Specifically, for points &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;, the discrete metric is defined by
:formula_153
under which a sequence of points (&quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;) converges to point &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; if and only if &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot; = &quot;x&quot; for all but finitely many &quot;k&quot;. Therefore, &quot;if the limit set exists&quot; it contains the points and only the points which are in all except finitely many of the sets of the sequence. Since convergence in the discrete metric is the strictest form of convergence (i.e., requires the most), this definition of a limit set is the strictest possible.

If (&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is a sequence of subsets of &quot;X&quot;, then the following always exist:
* lim sup &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; consists of elements of &quot;X&quot; which belong to &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; for infinitely many &quot;n&quot; (see countably infinite). That is, &quot;x&quot; ∈ lim sup &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; if and only if there exists a subsequence (&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;k&quot;) of (&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;) such that &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;k&quot; for all &quot;k&quot;.
* lim inf &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; consists of elements of &quot;X&quot; which belong to &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; for all except finitely many &quot;n&quot; (i.e., for cofinitely many &quot;n&quot;). That is, &quot;x&quot; ∈ lim inf &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; if and only if there exists some &quot;m&quot; &gt; 0 such that &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; for all &quot;n&quot; &gt; &quot;m&quot;.
Observe that &quot;x&quot; ∈ lim sup &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; if and only if &quot;x&quot; ∉ lim inf &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;c.
* lim &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; exists if and only if lim inf &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; and lim sup &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; agree, in which case lim &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; = lim sup &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; = lim inf &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;.
In this sense, the sequence has a limit so long as every point in &quot;X&quot; either appears in all except finitely many &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; or appears in all except finitely many &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;c.
Using the standard parlance of set theory, set inclusion provides a partial ordering on the collection of all subsets of &quot;X&quot; that allows set intersection to generate a greatest lower bound and set union to generate a least upper bound. Thus, the infimum or meet of a collection of subsets is the greatest lower bound while the supremum or join is the least upper bound. In this context, the inner limit, lim inf &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;, is the largest meeting of tails of the sequence, and the outer limit, lim sup &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;, is the smallest joining of tails of the sequence. The following makes this precise. 
*Let &quot;I&quot;&quot;n&quot; be the meet of the &quot;n&quot;th tail of the sequence. That is,
::formula_154
:The sequence (&quot;I&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is non-decreasing (i.e. &quot;I&quot;&quot;n&quot; ⊆ &quot;I&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1) because each &quot;I&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 is the intersection of fewer sets than &quot;I&quot;&quot;n&quot;. The least upper bound on this sequence of meets of tails is 
::formula_155
:So the limit infimum contains all subsets which are lower bounds for all but finitely many sets of the sequence.

*Similarly, let &quot;J&quot;&quot;n&quot; be the join of the &quot;n&quot;th tail of the sequence. That is,
::formula_156
:The sequence (&quot;J&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is non-increasing (i.e. &quot;J&quot;&quot;n&quot; ⊇ &quot;J&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1) because each &quot;J&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 is the union of fewer sets than &quot;J&quot;&quot;n&quot;. The greatest lower bound on this sequence of joins of tails is 
::formula_157
:So the limit supremum is contained in all subsets which are upper bounds for all but finitely many sets of the sequence.

===Examples===

The following are several set convergence examples. They have been broken into sections with respect to the metric used to induce the topology on set &quot;X&quot;.

; Using the discrete metric

* The Borel–Cantelli lemma is an example application of these constructs.

; Using either the discrete metric or the Euclidean metric

* Consider the set &quot;X&quot; = {0,1} and the sequence of subsets:
::formula_158
:The &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;even&quot; elements of this sequence form two subsequences, ({0}, {0}, {0}, ...) and ({1}, {1}, {1}, ...), which have limit points 0 and 1, respectively, and so the outer or superior limit is the set {0,1} of these two points. However, there are no limit points that can be taken from the (&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;) sequence as a whole, and so the interior or inferior limit is the empty set { }. That is,
:* lim sup &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; = {0,1}
:* lim inf &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; = { }
:However, for (&quot;Y&quot;&quot;n&quot;) = ({0}, {0}, {0}, ...) and (&quot;Z&quot;&quot;n&quot;) = ({1}, {1}, {1}, ...):
:* lim sup &quot;Y&quot;&quot;n&quot; = lim inf &quot;Y&quot;&quot;n&quot; = lim &quot;Y&quot;&quot;n&quot; = {0}
:* lim sup &quot;Z&quot;&quot;n&quot; = lim inf &quot;Z&quot;&quot;n&quot; = lim &quot;Z&quot;&quot;n&quot; = {1}

* Consider the set &quot;X&quot; = {50, 20, −100, −25, 0, 1} and the sequence of subsets:
::formula_159
:As in the previous two examples,
:* lim sup &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; = {0,1}
:* lim inf &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; = { }
:That is, the four elements that do not match the pattern do not affect the lim inf and lim sup because there are only finitely many of them. In fact, these elements could be placed anywhere in the sequence. So long as the &quot;tails&quot; of the sequence are maintained, the outer and inner limits will be unchanged. The related concepts of &quot;essential&quot; inner and outer limits, which use the essential supremum and essential infimum, provide an important modification that &quot;squashes&quot; countably many (rather than just finitely many) interstitial additions.

; Using the Euclidean metric

* Consider the sequence of subsets of rational numbers:
::formula_160
:The &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;even&quot; elements of this sequence form two subsequences, ({0}, {1/2}, {2/3}, {3/4}, ...) and ({1}, {1/2}, {1/3}, {1/4}, ...), which have limit points 1 and 0, respectively, and so the outer or superior limit is the set {0,1} of these two points. However, there are no limit points that can be taken from the (&quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;) sequence as a whole, and so the interior or inferior limit is the empty set { }. So, as in the previous example,
:* lim sup &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; = {0,1}
:* lim inf &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; = { }
:However, for (&quot;Y&quot;&quot;n&quot;) = ({0}, {1/2}, {2/3}, {3/4}, ...) and (&quot;Z&quot;&quot;n&quot;) = ({1}, {1/2}, {1/3}, {1/4}, ...):
:* lim sup &quot;Y&quot;&quot;n&quot; = lim inf &quot;Y&quot;&quot;n&quot; = lim &quot;Y&quot;&quot;n&quot; = {1}
:* lim sup &quot;Z&quot;&quot;n&quot; = lim inf &quot;Z&quot;&quot;n&quot; = lim &quot;Z&quot;&quot;n&quot; = {0}
:In each of these four cases, the elements of the limiting sets are not elements of any of the sets from the original sequence.

* The Ω limit (i.e., limit set) of a solution to a dynamic system is the outer limit of solution trajectories of the system. Because trajectories become closer and closer to this limit set, the tails of these trajectories &quot;converge&quot; to the limit set.
:* For example, an LTI system that is the cascade connection of several stable systems with an undamped second-order LTI system (i.e., zero damping ratio) will oscillate endlessly after being perturbed (e.g., an ideal bell after being struck). Hence, if the position and velocity of this system are plotted against each other, trajectories will approach a circle in the state space. This circle, which is the Ω limit set of the system, is the outer limit of solution trajectories of the system. The circle represents the locus of a trajectory corresponding to a pure sinusoidal tone output; that is, the system output approaches/approximates a pure tone.

==Generalized definitions==

The above definitions are inadequate for many technical applications. In fact, the definitions above are specializations of the following definitions.

===Definition for a set===

The limit inferior of a set &quot;X&quot; ⊆ &quot;Y&quot; is the infimum of all of the limit points of the set. That is,
:formula_161
Similarly, the limit superior of &quot;X&quot; is the supremum of all of the limit points of the set. That is,
:formula_162
Note that the set &quot;X&quot; needs to be defined as a subset of a partially ordered set &quot;Y&quot; that is also a topological space in order for these definitions to make sense. Moreover, it has to be a complete lattice so that the suprema and infima always exist. In that case every set has a limit superior and a limit inferior. Also note that the limit inferior and the limit superior of a set do not have to be elements of the set.

===Definition for filter bases===
Take a topological space &quot;X&quot; and a filter base &quot;B&quot; in that space. The set of all cluster points for that filter base is given by
:formula_163
where formula_164 is the closure of formula_165. This is clearly a closed set and is similar to the set of limit points of a set. Assume that &quot;X&quot; is also a partially ordered set. The limit superior of the filter base &quot;B&quot; is defined as
:formula_166
when that supremum exists. When &quot;X&quot; has a total order, is a complete lattice and has the order topology,
:formula_167
Similarly, the limit inferior of the filter base &quot;B&quot; is defined as
:formula_168
when that infimum exists; if &quot;X&quot; is totally ordered, is a complete lattice, and has the order topology, then
:formula_169

If the limit inferior and limit superior agree, then there must be exactly one cluster point and the limit of the filter base is equal to this unique cluster point.

====Specialization for sequences and nets====
Note that filter bases are generalizations of nets, which are generalizations of sequences. Therefore, these definitions give the limit inferior and limit superior of any net (and thus any sequence) as well. For example, take topological space formula_114 and the net formula_171, where formula_172 is a directed set and formula_173 for all formula_174. The filter base (&quot;of tails&quot;) generated by this net is formula_175 defined by
:formula_176
Therefore, the limit inferior and limit superior of the net are equal to the limit superior and limit inferior of formula_175 respectively. Similarly, for topological space formula_114, take the sequence formula_1 where formula_180 for any formula_181. The filter base (&quot;of tails&quot;) generated by this sequence is formula_182 defined by
:formula_183
Therefore, the limit inferior and limit superior of the sequence are equal to the limit superior and limit inferior of formula_182 respectively.

<text>Manuel II Palaiologos or Palaeologus (; 27 June 1350 – 21 July 1425) was Byzantine emperor from 1391 to 1425. Shortly before his death he was tonsured a monk and received the name Matthew (). His wife Helena Dragaš saw to it that their sons, John VIII and Constantine XI, became emperors. He is commemorated by the Greek Orthodox Church on 21 July.

==Life==
Manuel II Palaiologos was the second son of Emperor John V Palaiologos and his wife Helena Kantakouzene. Granted the title of &quot;despotēs&quot; by his father, the future Manuel II traveled west to seek support for the Byzantine Empire in 1365 and in 1370, serving as governor in Thessalonica from 1369. The failed attempt at usurpation by his older brother Andronikos IV Palaiologos in 1373 led to Manuel&#x27;s being proclaimed his father&#x27;s heir and he was proclaimed emperor on 25 September 1373.

In 1376–1379 and again in 1390, Manuel and his father were supplanted by Andronikos IV and then his son John VII, but Manuel personally defeated his nephew with help from the Republic of Venice in 1390. Although John V had been restored, Manuel was forced to go as an honorary hostage to the court of the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I at Prousa (Bursa). During his stay, Manuel was forced to participate in the Ottoman campaign that reduced Philadelpheia, the last Byzantine enclave in Anatolia.

===Siege of Constantinople and letters to European courts===
Having heard of his father&#x27;s death in February 1391, Manuel II Palaiologos fled the Ottoman court and secured the capital against any potential claim by his nephew John VII. Following Manuel&#x27;s joint marriage-coronation in 1392 with Helena Dragaš, the daughter of fellow Ottoman vassal Constantine Dragaš, the Sultan was initially content to leave New Rome in comparative peace. However, in 1393 a large insurrection erupted in Bulgaria which, although successfully put down by the Ottomans, caused Bayezid to lapse into an episode of paranoia in which he believed his various Christian vassals were plotting against him. Bayezid called all his Christian vassals to a meeting at Serres, with the intention of massacring them, a decision he relented on only at the last moment. The episode is said to have left all of the Christian vassal rulers shaken and convinced Manuel that continued appeasement towards the Ottomans was not a guarantee of his own personal safety or the continued survival of the empire and that efforts must be made to obtain Western aid.

Sultan Bayezid I blockaded Constantinople from 1394 to 1402. In the meantime, an anti-Ottoman crusade led by the Hungarian King Sigismund of Luxemburg failed at the Battle of Nicopolis on 25 September 1396. Manuel II had sent 10 ships to help in that Crusade. In October 1397, Theodore Kantakouzenos, Manuel&#x27;s uncle, alongside John of Natala arrived at the court of Charles VI of France, bearing the Emperor&#x27;s letters (dated 1 July 1397) requesting the French king&#x27;s military aid. In addition, Charles also provided funds for the two nobles to treat with King Richard II of England in April 1398, with the aim of soliciting further aid. However, the latter was too preoccupied by domestic troubles at this point to provide any support.

However, the two nobles returned home with the Marshal of France Jean II Le Maingre who was sent from Aigues-Mortes with six ships carrying 1,200 men to assist Manuel II. The Marshal encouraged the latter to go personally to seek assistance against the Ottoman Empire from the courts of western Europe. After some five years of siege, Manuel II entrusted the city to his nephew, aided by a French garrison of 300 men led by Seigneur Jean de Châteaumorand and embarked (along with a suite of 40 people) on a long trip abroad along with the Marshal.

===Emperor&#x27;s trip to the West===
On 10 December 1399, Manuel II embarked on his trip by starting to sail to the Morea, where he left his wife and children with his brother Theodore I Palaiologos to be protected from his nephew&#x27;s intentions. He later landed in Venice in April 1400, then he went to Padua, Vicenza and Pavia, until he reached Milan, where he met Duke Gian Galeazzo Visconti, and his close friend Manuel Chrysoloras. Afterwards, he met Charles VI of France at Charenton on 3 June 1400. During his stay in France, Manuel II continued to contact European monarchs.

According to Michel Pintoin who chronicled the visit to Paris:

In December 1400, he embarked to England to meet Henry IV of England who received him at Blackheath on the 21st of that month, making him the only Byzantine emperor ever to visit England, where he stayed at Eltham Palace until mid-February 1401, and a joust took place in his honour. In addition, he received £2,000, acknowledging receipt of the funds in a Latin document sealed with his own golden bull.

Thomas Walsingham wrote about Manuel II&#x27;s visit to England:
Moreover, Adam of Usk reported:
However, Manuel II sent a letter to his friend Manuel Chrysoloras, describing his visit to England:
Manuel II later returned to France with high hopes of substantial help and funds for Constantinople. In the meantime, he sent delegations with relics including pieces of the tunic of Christ and a piece of the Holy Sponge to Pope Boniface IX and Antipope Benedict XIII, Queen Margaret I of Denmark, king Martin of Aragon and king Charles III of Navarre to seek further assistance. He eventually left France on 23 November 1402, and finally returned to Constantinople in June 1403.

===Renewed Ottoman sieges===
The Ottomans under Bayezid I were themselves crushingly defeated by Timur at the Battle of Ankara in 1402. As the sons of Bayezid I struggled with each other over the succession in the Ottoman Interregnum, John VII was able to secure the return of the European coast of the Sea of Marmara and of Thessalonica to the Byzantine Empire in the Treaty of Gallipoli. When Manuel II returned home in 1403, his nephew duly surrendered control of Constantinople and received as a reward the governorship of newly recovered Thessalonica. The treaty also regained from the Ottomans Mesembria (1403–1453), Varna (1403–1415), and the Marmara coast from Scutari to Nicomedia (between 1403–1421).


However, Manuel II kept contact with Venice, Genoa, Paris and Aragon, by sending envoy Manuel Chrysoloras in 1407–8, pursuing to form a coalition against the Ottomans.

On 25 July 1414, with a fleet consisting of four galleys and two other vessels carrying contingents of infantry and cavalry, departed Constantinople for Thessalonica. The purpose of this force soon became clear when he made an unannounced stop at Thasos, a normally unimportant island which was then under threat from a son of the lord of Lesbos, Francesco Gattilusio. It took Manuel three months to reassert imperial authority on the island. Only then did he continue on to Thessalonica, where he was warmly met by his son Andronicus, who then governed the city.

In the spring of 1415, he and his soldiers left for the Peloponnese, arriving at the little port of Kenchreai on Good Friday, 29 March. Manuel II Palaiologos used his time there to bolster the defences of the Despotate of Morea, where the Byzantine Empire was actually expanding at the expense of the remnants of the Latin Empire. Here Manuel supervised the building of the &quot;Hexamilion&quot; (six-mile wall) across the Isthmus of Corinth, intended to defend the Peloponnese from the Ottomans.

Manuel II stood on friendly terms with the victor in the Ottoman civil war, Mehmed I (1402–1421), but his attempts to meddle in the next contested succession led to a new assault on Constantinople by Murad II (1421–1451) in 1422. During the last years of his life, Manuel II relinquished most official duties to his son and heir John VIII Palaiologos, and went back to the West searching for assistance against the Ottomans, this time to the King Sigismund of Hungary, staying for two months in his court of Buda. Sigismund (after suffering a defeat against the Turks in the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396) never rejected the possibility of fighting against the Ottoman Empire. However, with the Hussite wars in Bohemia, it was impossible to count on the Czech or German armies, and the Hungarian ones were needed to protect the Kingdom and control the religious conflicts. Unhappily Manuel returned home with empty hands from the Hungarian Kingdom, and in 1424 he and his son were forced to sign an unfavourable peace treaty with the Ottoman Turks, whereby the Byzantine Empire had to pay tribute to the sultan.

==Death==
Manuel II was paralyzed by a stroke on 1 October 1422, but his mind was unaffected and he continued to rule for three more years. He lived his last few days as a monk, taking the name of Matthew. He died on 21 July 1425, aged 75, and was buried at the Pantokrator Monastery in Constantinople.

==Writings==
Manuel II was the author of numerous works of varied character, including letters, poems, a Saint&#x27;s Life, treatises on theology and rhetoric, and an epitaph for his brother Theodore I Palaiologos and a mirror of princes for his son and heir John. This mirror of princes has special value, because it is the last sample of this literary genre bequeathed to us by Byzantines.

==Pope Benedict XVI controversy==

In a lecture delivered on 12 September 2006, Pope Benedict XVI quoted from a dialogue believed to have occurred in 1391 between Manuel II and a Persian scholar and recorded in a book by Manuel II (Dialogue 7 of &quot;Twenty-six Dialogues with a Persian&quot;) in which the Emperor stated: &quot;Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.&quot;

<doc id="44844" wikidata="Q340015" url="?curid=44844" title="Deixis">
<text>In linguistics, deixis (, ) is the use of words or phrases to refer to a particular time (e.g. &quot;then&quot;), place (e.g. &quot;here&quot;), or person (e.g. &quot;you&quot;) relative to the context of the utterance. Deixis exists in all known natural languages and is closely related to anaphora, with a sometimes unclear distinction between the two. In linguistic anthropology, deixis is seen as the same as, or a subclass of, indexicality.

The term&#x27;s origin is . To this, Chrysippus () added the specialized meaning &quot;point of reference&quot;, which is the sense in which the term is used in contemporary linguistics.

== Types ==
There are three main types of deictic words, as described by Charles J. Fillmore: personal, spatial, and temporal. In some languages, these may overlap, such as spatial and personal deixis in many signed pronouns. Some linguists consider social deixis to be a fourth type.

=== Personal ===

Personal deictic words, called personal pronouns in English, refer to the grammatical persons involved in an utterance. These can include the first person (speaker), second person (addressee), third, and in some languages fourth and fifth person. Personal deixis may give further information about the referent, such as gender. Examples of personal deixis include:

:&quot;I&quot; am going to the cinema.
:Would &quot;you&quot; like to have dinner?
:&quot;They&quot; tried to hurt &quot;me&quot;, but &quot;she&quot; helped me.

=== Spatial ===
Spatial, or place, deixis is used to refer to spatial locations relative to an utterance. Similarly to personal deixis, the locations may be either those of the speaker and addressee or those of persons or objects being referred to. Spatial demonstratives include locative adverbs (e.g. &quot;here&quot; and &quot;there)&quot; and demonstratives (e.g. &quot;this&quot;, &quot;these&quot;, &quot;that&quot;, and &quot;those)&quot; although those are far from exclusive. Spatial demonstratives are often relative to the location of the speaker such as:

:The shop is &quot;across the street&quot;.

where &quot;across the street&quot; is understood to mean &quot;across the street from where I [the speaker] am right now.&quot;

Words relating to spatial deixis can be proximal (near, such as English [right] &quot;here&quot; or &quot;this&quot;), medial (near the addressee, such as English [over] &quot;there&quot; or &quot;that&quot;), distal (far, such as English [out] &quot;there&quot; or &quot;that&quot;), far-distal (far from both the speaker and addressee, such as archaic English &quot;yon&quot; and &quot;).&quot; The Malagasy language has seven degrees of distance combined with two degrees of visibility, while many Inuit languages have even more complex systems.

=== Temporal ===
Temporal, or time, deixis is used to refer to time relevant to the utterance. This includes temporal adverbs (e.g. &quot;then&quot; and &quot;soon&quot;), nouns (e.g. &quot;tomorrow&quot;) and use of grammatical tense. Temporal deixis can be relative to the time when an utterance is made (the speaker’s &quot;now&quot;) or the time when the utterance is heard or seen (the addressee’s &quot;now&quot;). Although these are often the same time, they can differ in cases such as a voice recording or written text. For example:

:It is raining &quot;now&quot;, but I hope &quot;when&quot; you read this it will be sunny.

Tenses are usually separated into absolute (deictic) and relative tenses. For example, simple English past tense is absolute, such as &quot;He &quot;went.&quot;&quot; whereas the pluperfect is relative to some other deictically specified time, as in &quot;When I got home, he &quot;had gone&quot;.&quot;

=== Discourse deixis ===
Discourse deixis, also referred to as text deixis, refers to the use of expressions within an utterance to refer to parts of the discourse that contain the utterance—including the utterance itself. For example, in &quot;&quot;This&quot; is a great story.&quot; &quot;this&quot; refers to an upcoming portion of the discourse.

Switch reference is a type of discourse deixis, and a grammatical feature found in some languages, which indicates whether the argument of one clause is the same as the argument of the previous clause. In some languages, this is done through same subject markers and different subject markers. In the translated example &quot;John punched Tom, and left-[same subject marker],&quot; it is John who left, and in &quot;John punched Tom, and left-[different subject marker],&quot; it is Tom who left.

Discourse deixis has been observed in internet language, particularly with the use of iconic language forms resembling arrows.

=== Social deixis ===
Social deixis concerns the social information that is encoded within various expressions, such as relative social status and familiarity. These include T–V distinctions and honorifics.

== Deictic center ==
A deictic center, sometimes referred to as an origo, is a set of theoretical points that a deictic expression is &#x27;anchored&#x27; to, such that the evaluation of the meaning of the expression leads one to the relevant point. As deictic expressions are frequently egocentric, the center often consists of the speaker at the time and place of the utterance and, additionally, the place in the discourse and relevant social factors. However, deictic expressions can also be used in such a way that the deictic center is transferred to other participants in the exchange or to persons / places / etc. being described in a narrative. So, for example, in the sentence;

:I am standing here now.

the deictic center is simply the person at the time and place of speaking. But say two people are talking on the phone long-distance, from London to New York. The Londoner can say,

:We are leaving [London] next week.

in which case the deictic center is in London, or they can equally validly say,

:We are coming [to New York] next week.

in which case the deictic center is in New York. Similarly, when telling a story about someone, the deictic center is likely to switch to him, her or they (third-person pronouns). So then in the sentence;

:He then ran twenty feet to the left.

it is understood that the center is with the person being spoken of, and thus, &quot;to the left&quot; refers not to the speaker&#x27;s left, but to the object of the story&#x27;s left, that is, the person referred to as &#x27;he&#x27; at the time immediately before he ran twenty feet.

== Usages ==
It is helpful to distinguish between two usages of deixis, gestural and symbolic, as well as non-deictic usages of frequently deictic words. Gestural deixis refers, broadly, to deictic expressions whose understanding requires some sort of audio-visual information. A simple example is when an object is pointed at and referred to as &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot;. However, the category can include other types of information than pointing, such as direction of gaze, tone of voice, and so on. Symbolic usage, by contrast, requires generally only basic spatio-temporal knowledge of the utterance. So, for example

:I broke &quot;this&quot; finger.

requires being able to see which finger is being held up, whereas

:I love &quot;this&quot; city.

requires only knowledge of the current location. In a similar vein,

:I went to &quot;this&quot; city one time ...

is a non-deictic usage of &quot;this&quot;, which does not identify anywhere specifically. Rather, it is used as an indefinite article, much the way &quot;a&quot; could be used in its place.

== Distinction with similar terms ==
The distinction between deixis and anaphora is unclearly defined. Generally, an anaphoric reference refers to something within a text that has been previously identified. For example, in &quot;Susan dropped the plate. &quot;It&quot; shattered loudly,&quot; the word &quot;it&quot; refers to the phrase, &quot;the plate&quot;. An expression can be both deictic and anaphoric at the same time, for example &quot;I was born in London, and I have lived &quot;here/there&quot; all my life.&quot; &quot;here&quot; or &quot;there&quot; function anaphorically in their reference to London, and deictically in that the choice between &quot;here&quot; or &quot;there&quot; indicates whether the speaker is or is not currently in London.

The terms deixis and indexicality are frequently used almost interchangeably, and both deal with essentially the same idea of contextually-dependent references. However, the two terms have different histories and traditions. In the past, deixis was associated specifically with spatiotemporal reference, and indexicality was used more broadly. More importantly, each is associated with a different field of study. Deixis is associated with linguistics, and indexicality is associated with philosophy as well as pragmatics.

<doc id="44845" wikidata="Q1064" url="?curid=44845" title="Alessandro Manzoni">
<text>Alessandro Francesco Tommaso Antonio Manzoni (, , ; 7 March 1785 – 22 May 1873) was an Italian poet, novelist and philosopher. He is famous for the novel &quot;The Betrothed&quot; (orig. ) (1827), generally ranked among the masterpieces of world literature. The novel is also a symbol of the Italian Risorgimento, both for its patriotic message and because it was a fundamental milestone in the development of the modern, unified Italian language. Manzoni also contributed to the stabilization of the modern Italian language and helped to ensure linguistic unity throughout Italy. He was an influential proponent of Liberal Catholicism in Italy. His work and thinking has often been contrasted with that of his younger contemporary Giacomo Leopardi by critics.

==Early life==
Manzoni was born in Milan, Italy, on 7 March 1785. Pietro, his father, aged about fifty, belonged to an old family of Lecco, originally feudal lords of Barzio, in the Valsassina. However, his biological father was likely the illuminist Giovanni Verri, brother of the influential writer Pietro Verri. The poet&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Cesare Beccaria, was a well-known author and philosopher, and his mother Giulia had literary talent as well. The young Alessandro spent his first two years in &quot;cascina Costa&quot; in Galbiate and he was wet-nursed by Caterina Panzeri, as attested by a memorial tablet affixed in the place. In 1792 his parents broke their marriage and his mother began a relationship with the writer Carlo Imbonati, moving to England and later to Paris. For this reason, Alessandro was brought up in several religious institutions.

Manzoni was a slow developer, and at the various colleges he attended he was considered a dunce. At fifteen, however, he developed a passion for poetry and wrote two sonnets of considerable merit. Upon the death of his father in 1807, he joined the freethinking household of his mother at Auteuil, and spent two years mixing with the literary set of the so-called &quot;ideologues&quot;, philosophers of the 18th-century school, among whom he made many friends, notably Claude Charles Fauriel. At Auteuil, he developed a lifelong interest in liberalism. He was even supposed to marry the daughter of Antoine Destutt de Tracy. There too he imbibed the anti-Catholic creed of Voltairianism.

In 1806–1807, while at Auteuil, he first appeared before the public as a poet, with two works, one entitled &quot;Urania&quot;, in the classical style, of which he became later the most conspicuous adversary, the other an elegy in blank verse, on the death of Count Carlo Imbonati, from whom, through his mother, he inherited considerable property, including the villa of Brusuglio, thenceforth his principal residence.

==1808–1821==
In 1808, Manzoni married Henriette Blondel, daughter of a Genevese banker. She came from a Calvinist family, but in 1810 she became a Roman Catholic. Her conversion profoundly influenced her husband. That same year he experienced a religious crisis which led him from Jansenism to an austere form of Catholicism. Manzoni&#x27;s marriage proved a happy one, and he led for many years a retired domestic life, divided between literature and the picturesque husbandry of Lombardy.

His intellectual energy in this period of his life was devoted to the composition of the &quot;Inni sacri&quot;, a series of sacred lyrics, and of a treatise on Catholic morality, &quot;Osservazioni sulla morale cattolica&quot;, a task undertaken under religious guidance, in reparation for his early lapse from faith. In 1818 he had to sell his paternal inheritance, as his money had been lost to a dishonest agent. His characteristic generosity was shown at this time in his dealings with his peasants, who were heavily indebted to him. He not only cancelled on the spot the record of all sums owed to him, but bade them keep for themselves the whole of the coming maize harvest.

In 1819, Manzoni published his first tragedy, &quot;Il Conte di Carmagnola&quot;, which, boldly violating all classical conventions, excited a lively controversy. It was severely criticized in a &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; article to which Goethe replied in its defence, &quot;one genius,&quot; as Count de Gubernatis remarks, &quot;having divined the other.&quot; The death of Napoleon in 1821 inspired Manzoni&#x27;s powerful stanzas &quot;Il Cinque maggio&quot; (&quot;The Fifth of May&quot;), one of the most popular lyrics in the Italian language. The political events of that year, and the imprisonment of many of his friends, weighed much on Manzoni&#x27;s mind, and the historical studies in which he sought distraction during his subsequent retirement at Brusuglio suggested his great work.

==&quot;The Betrothed&quot;==

Manzoni started work on the novel in 1821, but he began the actual composition of &quot;Fermo e Lucia&quot; on 24 April 1821, after reading the novels of Walter Scott, mainly in French translations. Round the episode of the Innominato, historically identified with Bernardino Visconti, the first manuscript of the novel &quot;The Betrothed&quot; (in Italian &quot;I promessi sposi&quot;) began to grow into shape, and was completed in September 1823. The work was published, after being deeply reshaped by the author and revised by friends in 1825–1827, at the rate of a volume a year; it at once raised its author to the first rank of literary fame. It is generally agreed to be his greatest work, and the paradigm of modern Italian language. The Penguin Companion to European Literature notes that &#x27;the book&#x27;s real greatness lies in its delineation of character...in the heroine, Lucia, in Padre Cristoforo, the Capuchin friar, and the saintly cardinal (Borromeo) of Milan, he has created three living examples of that pure and wholehearted Christianity which is his ideal. But his psychological penetration extends also to those who fall short of this standard, whether through weakness or perversity, and the novel is rich in pictures of ordinary men and women, seen with a delightful irony and disenchantment which always stops short of cynicism, and which provides a perfect balance for the evangelical fervour of his ideal&#x27;. In 1822, Manzoni published his second tragedy, &quot;Adelchi&quot;, turning on the overthrow by Charlemagne of the Lombard domination in Italy, and containing many veiled allusions to the existing Austrian rule. With these works Manzoni&#x27;s literary career was practically closed. But he laboriously revised &quot;The Betrothed&quot; in Tuscan-Italian, and in 1840 republished it in that form, with a historical essay, &quot;Storia della colonna infame&quot;, on details of the 17th-century plague in Milan so important in the novel. He also wrote a small treatise on the Italian language.

==Politics and economics==
Manzoni favored the Italian unification and was even a member of the Italian Senate. Before and after his embracing an austere Catholicism upon marrying Henriett Blondel, Manzoni&#x27;s politics can be broadly described as liberal. Since his French trip, Manzoni&#x27;s liberalism included a profound understanding of economics. He was well acquainted with authors such as Jean-Baptiste Say and Adam Smith and left numerous notes on the economic treatises and essays he was reading.

His understanding of economics came to surface in his grand historical novel &quot;The Betrothed&quot;, particularly in Chapter 12, where he deals with the famine in Lombardy. Economist and President of the Italian Republic Luigi Einaudi praised the chapter and the whole of &quot;The Betrothed&quot; as &quot;one of the best treatises on political economy ever written&quot;. Economic historian Deirdre N. McCloskey likewise described it as &quot;a lecture in Economics 101&quot;.

==Family, death and legacy==
The death of Manzoni&#x27;s wife in 1833 was preceded and followed by those of several of his children, and of his mother. In the mid-1830s he attended the &quot;Salotto Maffei&quot;, a salon in Milan hosted by Clara Maffei, and in 1837 he married again, to Teresa Borri, widow of Count Stampa. Teresa also died before him, while of nine children born to him in his two marriages all but two pre-deceased him. In 1860 King Victor Emmanuel II named him a senator. The death of his eldest son, Pier Luigi, on 28 April 1873, was the final blow which hastened his end. He was already weakened as he had fallen on 6 January while exiting the San Fedele church, hitting his head on the steps, and he died after 5 months of cerebral meningitis, a complication of the trauma. His funeral was celebrated in the Milan Cathedral with almost royal pomp. His remains, after they lay in state for some days, were followed to the Cimitero Monumentale in Milan by a vast cortege, including the royal princes and all the great officers of state, but his noblest monument was Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;, written to honour his memory. In modern times, he has been honored twice with a Google Doodle.
His novel &quot;Osservazioni sulla morale cattolica&quot; was quoted by Pope Pius XI in his encyclical on Christian Education &quot;Divini Illius Magistri&quot;: &quot;20. It is worthy of note how a layman, an excellent writer and at the same time a profound and conscientious thinker, has been able to understand well and express exactly this fundamental Catholic doctrine: &#x27;The Church does not say that morality belongs purely, in the sense of exclusively, to her; but that it belongs wholly to her. She has never maintained that outside her fold and apart from her teaching, man cannot arrive at any moral truth; she has on the contrary more than once condemned this opinion because it has appeared under more forms than one. She does however say, has said, and will ever say, that because of her institution by Jesus Christ, because of the Holy Ghost sent her in His name by the Father, she alone possesses what she has had immediately from God and can never lose, the whole of moral truth, omnem veritatem, in which all individual moral truths are included, as well those which man may learn by the help of reason, as those which form part of revelation or which may be deduced from it&#x27;&quot;.

<doc id="44848" wikidata="Q5236" url="?curid=44848" title="Edward II of England">
<text>Edward II (25 April 1284 – 21 September 1327), also known as Edward of Caernarfon or Caernarvon, was King of England from 1307 until he was deposed in January 1327. The fourth son of Edward I, Edward became the heir to the throne following the death of his older brother Alphonso. Beginning in 1300, Edward accompanied his father on campaigns in Scotland, and in 1306 he was knighted in a grand ceremony at Westminster Abbey. Edward succeeded to the throne the next year, following his father&#x27;s death. In 1308, he married Isabella, daughter of the powerful King Philip IV of France, as part of a long-running effort to resolve the tensions between the English and French crowns.

Edward had a close and controversial relationship with Piers Gaveston, who had joined his household in 1300. The precise nature of Edward and Gaveston&#x27;s relationship is uncertain; they may have been friends, lovers, or sworn brothers. Gaveston&#x27;s arrogance and power as Edward&#x27;s favourite provoked discontent both among the barons and the French royal family, and Edward was forced to exile him. On Gaveston&#x27;s return, the barons pressured the King into agreeing to wide-ranging reforms called the Ordinances of 1311. The newly empowered barons banished Gaveston, to which Edward responded by revoking the reforms and recalling his favourite. Led by Edward&#x27;s cousin Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, a group of the barons seized and executed Gaveston in 1312, beginning several years of armed confrontation. English forces were pushed back in Scotland, where Edward was decisively defeated by Robert the Bruce at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Widespread famine followed, and criticism of the King&#x27;s reign mounted.

The Despenser family, in particular Hugh Despenser the Younger, became close friends and advisers to Edward, but in 1321 Lancaster and many of the barons seized the Despensers&#x27; lands and forced the King to exile them. In response, Edward led a short military campaign, capturing and executing Lancaster. Edward and the Despensers strengthened their grip on power, revoking the 1311 reforms, executing their enemies and confiscating estates. Unable to make progress in Scotland, Edward finally signed a truce with Robert. Opposition to the regime grew, and when Isabella was sent to France to negotiate a peace treaty in 1325, she turned against Edward and refused to return. Isabella allied herself with the exiled Roger Mortimer, and invaded England with a small army in 1326. Edward&#x27;s regime collapsed and he fled into Wales, where he was captured in November. Edward was forced to relinquish his crown in January 1327 in favour of his son, Edward III of England, and he died in Berkeley Castle on 21 September, probably murdered on the orders of the new regime.

Edward&#x27;s relationship with Gaveston inspired Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s 1592 play &quot;Edward II&quot;, along with other plays, films, novels and media. Many of these have focused on the possible sexual relationship between the two men. Edward&#x27;s contemporaries criticised his performance as a king, noting his failures in Scotland and the oppressive regime of his later years, although 19th-century academics have argued that the growth of parliamentary institutions during his reign was a positive development for England over the longer term. Debate has continued into the 21st century as to whether Edward was a lazy and incompetent king, or simply a reluctant and ultimately unsuccessful ruler.

==Background==
Edward II was the fourth son of Edward I, King of England, Lord of Ireland, and ruler of Gascony in south-western France (which he held as the feudal vassal of the king of France), and Eleanor, Countess of Ponthieu in northern France. Eleanor was from the Castilian royal family. Edward I proved a successful military leader, leading the suppression of the baronial revolts in the 1260s and joining the Ninth Crusade. During the 1280s he conquered North Wales, removing the native Welsh princes from power and, in the 1290s, he intervened in Scotland&#x27;s civil war, claiming suzerainty over the country. He was considered an extremely successful ruler by his contemporaries, largely able to control the powerful earls that formed the senior ranks of the English nobility. The historian Michael Prestwich describes Edward I as &quot;a king to inspire fear and respect&quot;, while John Gillingham characterises him as an &quot;efficient bully&quot;.

Despite Edward I&#x27;s successes, when he died in 1307 he left a range of challenges for his son to resolve. One of the most critical was the problem of English rule in Scotland, where Edward I&#x27;s long but ultimately inconclusive military campaign was ongoing when he died. His control of Gascony created tension with the French kings. They insisted that the English kings give homage to them for the lands; the English kings saw this demand as insulting to their honour, and the issue remained unresolved. Edward I also faced increasing opposition from his barons over the taxation and requisitions required to resource his wars, and left his son debts of around £200,000 on his death.

==Early life (1284–1307)==
===Birth===
Edward II was born in Caernarfon Castle in north Wales on 25 April 1284, less than a year after Edward I had conquered the region, and as a result is sometimes called Edward of Caernarfon. The King probably chose the castle deliberately as the location for Edward&#x27;s birth as it was an important symbolic location for the native Welsh, associated with Roman imperial history, and it formed the centre of the new royal administration of North Wales. Edward&#x27;s birth brought predictions of greatness from contemporary prophets, who believed that the Last Days of the world were imminent, declaring him a new King Arthur, who would lead England to glory. David Powel, a 16th-century clergyman, suggested that the baby was offered to the Welsh as a prince &quot;that was borne in Wales and could speake never a word of English&quot;, but there is no evidence to support this account.

Edward&#x27;s name was English in origin, linking him to the Anglo-Saxon saint Edward the Confessor, and was chosen by his father instead of the more traditional Norman and Castilian names selected for Edward&#x27;s brothers: John and Henry, who had died before Edward was born, and Alphonso, who died in August 1284, leaving Edward as the heir to the throne. Although Edward was a relatively healthy child, there were enduring concerns throughout his early years that he too might die and leave his father without a male heir. After his birth, Edward was looked after by a wet nurse called Mariota or Mary Maunsel for a few months until she fell ill, when Alice de Leygrave became his foster mother. He would have barely known his natural mother, Eleanor, who was in Gascony with his father during his earliest years. An official household, complete with staff, was created for the new baby, under the direction of a clerk, Giles of Oudenarde.

===Childhood, personality and appearance===
Spending increased on Edward&#x27;s personal household as he grew older and, in 1293, William of Blyborough took over as its administrator. Edward was probably given a religious education by the Dominican friars, whom his mother invited into his household in 1290. He was assigned one of his grandmother&#x27;s followers, Guy Ferre, as his &quot;magister&quot;, who was responsible for his discipline, training him in riding and military skills. It is uncertain how well educated Edward was; there is little evidence for his ability to read and write, although his mother was keen that her other children be well educated, and Ferre was himself a relatively learned man for the period. Edward likely mainly spoke Anglo-Norman French in his daily life, in addition to some English and possibly Latin.

Edward had a normal upbringing for a member of a royal family. He was interested in horses and horsebreeding, and became a good rider; he also liked dogs, in particular greyhounds. In his letters, he shows a quirky sense of humour, joking about sending unsatisfactory animals to his friends, such as horses who disliked carrying their riders, or lazy hunting dogs too slow to catch rabbits. He was not particularly interested in hunting or falconry, both popular activities in the 14th century. He enjoyed music, including Welsh music and the newly invented crwth instrument, as well as musical organs. He did not take part in jousting, either because he lacked the aptitude or because he had been banned from participating for his personal safety, but he was certainly enthusiastic in his support of the sport.

Edward grew up to be tall and muscular, and was considered good-looking by the standards of the period. He had a reputation as a competent public speaker and was known for his generosity to household staff. Unusually, he enjoyed rowing, as well as hedging and ditching, and enjoyed associating with labourers and other lower-class workers. This behaviour was not considered normal for the nobility of the period and attracted criticism from contemporaries.

In 1290, Edward&#x27;s father had confirmed the Treaty of Birgham, in which he promised to marry his six-year-old son to the young Margaret of Norway, who had a potential claim to the crown of Scotland. Margaret died later that year, bringing an end to the plan. Edward&#x27;s mother, Eleanor, died shortly afterwards, followed by his grandmother, Eleanor of Provence. Edward I was distraught at his wife&#x27;s death and held a huge funeral for her; his son inherited the County of Ponthieu from Eleanor. Next, a French marriage was considered for the young Edward, to help secure a lasting peace with France, but King PhilipIV&#x27;s refusal to release fortresses in Gascony offered by EdwardI provoked the Gascon War in 1294. The idea was replaced with the proposal of a marriage to a daughter of the rebellious Guy, Count of Flanders, but this too failed after King Philip was able to have the proposed bride sent to Paris.

===Early campaigns in Scotland===
Between 1297 and 1298, Edward was left as regent in charge of England while the King campaigned in Flanders against Philip IV, who had occupied part of the English king&#x27;s lands in Gascony. On his return, Edward I signed a peace treaty, under which he took Philip&#x27;s sister Margaret as his wife and agreed that Prince Edward would in due course marry Philip&#x27;s daughter, Isabella, who was then only two years old. In theory, this marriage would mean that the disputed Duchy of Gascony would be inherited by a descendant of both Edward and Philip, providing a possible end to the long-running tensions. The young Edward seems to have got on well with his new stepmother, who gave birth to two sons, Thomas of Brotherton in 1300 and Edmund of Woodstock in 1301. As king, Edward later provided his half-brothers with financial support and titles.

Edward I returned to Scotland once again in 1300, and this time took his son with him, making him the commander of the rearguard at the siege of Caerlaverock Castle. In the spring of 1301, the King declared Edward the Prince of Wales, granting him the earldom of Chester and lands across North Wales; he seems to have hoped that this would help pacify the region, and that it would give his son some financial independence. Edward received homage from his Welsh subjects and then joined his father for the 1301 Scottish campaign; he took an army of around 300 soldiers north with him and captured Turnberry Castle. Prince Edward also took part in the 1303 campaign during which he besieged Brechin Castle, deploying his own siege engine in the operation. In the spring of 1304, Edward conducted negotiations with the rebel Scottish leaders on the King&#x27;s behalf and, when these failed, he joined his father for the siege of Stirling Castle.

In 1305, Edward and his father quarrelled, probably over the issue of money. The prince had an altercation with Bishop Walter Langton, who served as the royal treasurer, apparently over the amount of financial support Edward received from the Crown. The King defended his treasurer, and banished Prince Edward and his companions from his court, cutting off their financial support. After some negotiations involving family members and friends, father and son were reconciled.

The Scottish conflict flared up once again in 1306, when Robert the Bruce killed his rival John Comyn III of Badenoch and declared himself King of the Scots. Edward I mobilised a fresh army, but decided that, this time, his son would be formally in charge of the expedition. Prince Edward was made the duke of Aquitaine and then, along with many other young men, he was knighted in a lavish ceremony at Westminster Abbey called the Feast of the Swans. Amid a huge feast in the neighbouring hall, reminiscent of Arthurian legends and crusading events, the assembly took a collective oath to defeat Bruce. It is unclear what role Prince Edward&#x27;s forces played in the campaign that summer, which, under the orders of Edward I, saw a punitive, brutal retaliation against Bruce&#x27;s faction in Scotland. Edward returned to England in September, where diplomatic negotiations to finalise a date for his wedding to Isabella continued.

===Piers Gaveston and sexuality===
During this time, Edward became close to Piers Gaveston. Gaveston was the son of one of the King&#x27;s household knights whose lands lay adjacent to Gascony, and had himself joined Prince Edward&#x27;s household in 1300, possibly on Edward I&#x27;s instruction. The two got on well; Gaveston became a squire and was soon being referred to as a close companion of Edward, before being knighted by the King during the Feast of the Swans in 1306. The King then exiled Gaveston to Gascony in 1307 for reasons that remain unclear. According to one chronicler, Edward had asked his father to allow him to give Gaveston the County of Ponthieu, and the King responded furiously, pulling his son&#x27;s hair out in great handfuls, before exiling Gaveston. The official court records, however, show Gaveston being only temporarily exiled, supported by a comfortable stipend; no reason is given for the order, suggesting that it may have been an act aimed at punishing the prince.

The possibility that Edward had a sexual relationship with Gaveston or his later favourites has been extensively discussed by historians, complicated by the scarcity of surviving evidence to determine for certain the details of their relationships. Homosexuality was fiercely condemned by the Church in 14th-century England, which equated it with heresy. Both men had sexual relationships with their wives, who bore them children; Edward also had an illegitimate son, and may have had an affair with his niece, Eleanor de Clare.

The contemporary evidence supporting their homosexual relationship comes primarily from an anonymous chronicler in the 1320s who described how Edward &quot;felt such love&quot; for Gaveston that &quot;he entered into a covenant of constancy, and bound himself with him before all other mortals with a bond of indissoluble love, firmly drawn up and fastened with a knot.&quot; The first specific suggestion that Edward engaged in sex with men was recorded in 1334, when Adam Orleton, the Bishop of Winchester, was accused of having stated in 1326 that Edward was a &quot;sodomite&quot;, although Orleton defended himself by arguing that he had meant that Edward&#x27;s adviser, Hugh Despenser the Younger, was a sodomite, rather than the late king. The Meaux Chronicle from the 1390s simply notes that Edward gave himself &quot;too much to the vice of sodomy&quot;.

Alternatively, Edward and Gaveston may have simply been friends with a close working relationship. Contemporary chronicler comments are vaguely worded; Orleton&#x27;s allegations were at least in part politically motivated, and are very similar to the highly politicised sodomy allegations made against Pope Boniface VIII and the Knights Templar in 1303 and 1308, respectively. Later accounts by chroniclers of Edward&#x27;s activities may trace back to Orleton&#x27;s original allegations, and were certainly adversely coloured by the events at the end of Edward&#x27;s reign. Such historians as Michael Prestwich and Seymour Phillips have argued that the public nature of the English royal court would have made it unlikely that any homosexual affairs would have remained discreet; neither the contemporary Church, Edward&#x27;s father nor his father-in-law appear to have made any adverse comments about Edward&#x27;s sexual behaviour.

A more recent theory, proposed by the historian Pierre Chaplais, suggests that Edward and Gaveston entered into a bond of adoptive brotherhood. Compacts of adoptive brotherhood, in which the participants pledged to support each other in a form of &quot;brotherhood-in-arms&quot;, were not unknown between close male friends in the Middle Ages. Many chroniclers described Edward and Gaveston&#x27;s relationship as one of brotherhood, and one explicitly noted that Edward had taken Gaveston as his adopted brother. Chaplais argues that the pair may have made a formal compact in either 1300 or 1301, and that they would have seen any later promises they made to separate or to leave each other as having been made under duress, and therefore invalid.

==Early reign (1307–1311)==
===Coronation and marriage===
Edward I mobilised another army for the Scottish campaign in 1307, which Prince Edward was due to join that summer, but the elderly king had been increasingly unwell and died on 7 July at Burgh by Sands. Edward travelled from London immediately after the news reached him, and on 20 July he was proclaimed king. He continued north into Scotland and on 4 August received homage from his Scottish supporters at Dumfries, before abandoning the campaign and returning south. Edward promptly recalled Piers Gaveston, who was then in exile, and made him Earl of Cornwall, before arranging his marriage to the wealthy Margaret de Clare. Edward also arrested his old adversary Bishop Langton, and dismissed him from his post as treasurer. Edward I&#x27;s body was kept at Waltham Abbey for several months before being taken for burial to Westminster, where Edward erected a simple marble tomb for his father.

In 1308, Edward&#x27;s marriage to Isabella of France proceeded. Edward crossed the English Channel to France in January, leaving Gaveston as his &quot;custos regni&quot; in charge of the kingdom. This arrangement was unusual, and involved unprecedented powers being delegated to Gaveston, backed by a specially engraved Great Seal. Edward probably hoped that the marriage would strengthen his position in Gascony and bring him much needed funds. The final negotiations, however, proved challenging: Edward and Philip IV did not like each other, and the French king drove a hard bargain over the size of Isabella&#x27;s dower and the details of the administration of Edward&#x27;s lands in France. As part of the agreement, Edward gave homage to Philip for the Duchy of Aquitaine and agreed to a commission to complete the implementation of the 1303 Treaty of Paris.

The pair were married in Boulogne on 25 January. Edward gave Isabella a psalter as a wedding gift, and her father gave her gifts worth over 21,000 livres and a fragment of the True Cross. The pair returned to England in February, where Edward had ordered Westminster Palace to be lavishly restored in readiness for their coronation and wedding feast, complete with marble tables, forty ovens and a fountain that produced wine and pimento, a spiced medieval drink. After some delays, the ceremony went ahead on 25 February at Westminster Abbey, under the guidance of Henry Woodlock, the Bishop of Winchester. As part of the coronation, Edward swore to uphold &quot;the rightful laws and customs which the community of the realm shall have chosen&quot;. It is uncertain what this meant: It might have been intended to force Edward to accept future legislation, it may have been inserted to prevent him from overturning any future vows he might take, or it may have been an attempt by the king to ingratiate himself with the barons. The event was marred by the large crowds of eager spectators who surged into the palace, knocking down a wall and forcing Edward to flee by the back door.

Isabella was only twelve at the time of her wedding, young even by the standards of the period, and Edward probably had sexual relations with mistresses during their first few years together. During this time he fathered an illegitimate son, Adam, who was born possibly as early as 1307. Edward and Isabella&#x27;s first son, the future Edward III, was born in 1312 amid great celebrations, and three more children followed: John in 1316, Eleanor in 1318 and Joan in 1321.

===Tensions over Gaveston===
Gaveston&#x27;s return from exile in 1307 was initially accepted by the barons, but opposition quickly grew. He appeared to have an excessive influence on royal policy, leading to complaints from one chronicler that there were &quot;two kings reigning in one kingdom, the one in name and the other in deed&quot;. Accusations, probably untrue, were levelled at Gaveston that he had stolen royal funds and had purloined Isabella&#x27;s wedding presents. Gaveston had played a key role at Edward&#x27;s coronation, provoking fury from both the English and the French contingents about the earl&#x27;s ceremonial precedence and magnificent clothes, and about Edward&#x27;s apparent preference for Gaveston&#x27;s company over that of Isabella at the feast.

Parliament met in February 1308 in a heated atmosphere. Edward was eager to discuss the potential for governmental reform, but the barons were unwilling to begin any such debate until the problem of Gaveston had been resolved. Violence seemed likely, but the situation was resolved through the mediation of the moderate Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln, who convinced the barons to back down. A fresh parliament was held in April, where the barons once again criticised Gaveston, demanding his exile, this time supported by Isabella and the French monarchy. Edward resisted, but finally acquiesced, agreeing to send Gaveston to Aquitaine, under threat of excommunication by the Archbishop of Canterbury should he return. At the last moment, Edward changed his mind and instead sent Gaveston to Dublin, appointing him as the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

Edward called for a fresh military campaign for Scotland, but this idea was quietly abandoned, and instead the king and the barons met in August 1308 to discuss reform. Behind the scenes, Edward started negotiations to convince both Pope Clement V and Philip IV to allow Gaveston to return to England, offering in exchange to suppress the Knights Templar in England, and to release Bishop Langton from prison. Edward called a new meeting of members of the Church and key barons in January 1309, and the leading earls then gathered in March and April, possibly under the leadership of Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster. Another parliament followed, which refused to allow Gaveston to return to England, but offered to grant Edward additional taxes if he agreed to a programme of reform.

Edward sent assurances to the Pope that the conflict surrounding Gaveston&#x27;s role was at an end. On the basis of these promises, and procedural concerns about how the original decision had been taken, the Pope agreed to annul the Archbishop&#x27;s threat to excommunicate Gaveston, thus opening the possibility of Gaveston&#x27;s return. Gaveston arrived back in England in June, where he was met by Edward. At the parliament the next month, Edward made a range of concessions to placate those opposed to Gaveston, including agreeing to limit the powers of the royal steward and the marshal of the royal household, to regulate the Crown&#x27;s unpopular powers of purveyance, and to abandon recently enacted customs legislation; in return, parliament agreed to fresh taxes for the war in Scotland. Temporarily, at least, Edward and the barons appeared to have come to a successful compromise.

===Ordinances of 1311===
Following his return, Gaveston&#x27;s relationship with the major barons became increasingly difficult. He was considered arrogant, and he took to referring to the earls by offensive names, including calling one of their more powerful members the &quot;dog of Warwick&quot;. The Earl of Lancaster and Gaveston&#x27;s enemies refused to attend parliament in 1310 because Gaveston would be present. Edward was facing increasing financial problems, owing £22,000 to his Frescobaldi Italian bankers, and facing protests about how he was using his right of prises to acquire supplies for the war in Scotland. His attempts to raise an army for Scotland collapsed and the earls suspended the collection of the new taxes.

The king and parliament met again in February 1310, and the proposed discussions of Scottish policy were replaced by debate of domestic problems. Edward was petitioned to abandon Gaveston as his counsellor and instead adopt the advice of 21 elected barons, termed Ordainers, who would carry out a widespread reform of both the government and the royal household. Under huge pressure, he agreed to the proposal and the Ordainers were elected, broadly evenly split between reformers and conservatives. While the Ordainers began their plans for reform, Edward and Gaveston took a new army of around 4,700 men to Scotland, where the military situation had continued to deteriorate. Robert the Bruce declined to give battle and the campaign progressed ineffectually over the winter until supplies and money ran out in 1311, forcing Edward to return south.

By now the Ordainers had drawn up their Ordinances for reform and Edward had little political choice but to give way and accept them in October. The Ordinances of 1311 contained clauses limiting the king&#x27;s right to go to war or to grant land without parliament&#x27;s approval, giving parliament control over the royal administration, abolishing the system of prises, excluding the Frescobaldi bankers, and introducing a system to monitor the adherence to the Ordinances. In addition, the Ordinances exiled Gaveston once again, this time with instructions that he should not be allowed to live anywhere within Edward&#x27;s lands, including Gascony and Ireland, and that he should be stripped of his titles. Edward retreated to his estates at Windsor and Kings Langley; Gaveston left England, possibly for northern France or Flanders.

==Mid-reign (1311–1321)==
===Death of Gaveston===
Tensions between Edward and the barons remained high, and the earls opposed to the king kept their personal armies mobilised late into 1311. By now Edward had become estranged from his cousin, the Earl of Lancaster, who was also the Earl of Leicester, Lincoln, Salisbury and Derby, with an income of around £11,000 a year from his lands, almost double that of the next wealthiest baron. Backed by the earls of Arundel, Gloucester, Hereford, Pembroke and Warwick, Lancaster led a powerful faction in England, but he was not personally interested in practical administration, nor was he a particularly imaginative or effective politician.

Edward responded to the baronial threat by revoking the Ordinances and recalling Gaveston to England, being reunited with him at York in January 1312. The barons were furious and met in London, where Gaveston was excommunicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury and plans were put in place to capture Gaveston and prevent him from fleeing to Scotland. Edward, Isabella and Gaveston left for Newcastle, pursued by Lancaster and his followers. Abandoning many of their belongings, the royal party fled by ship and landed at Scarborough, where Gaveston stayed while Edward and Isabella returned to York. After a short siege, Gaveston surrendered to the earls of Pembroke and Surrey, on the promise that he would not be harmed. He had with him a huge collection of gold, silver and gems, probably part of the royal treasury, which he was later accused of having stolen from Edward.

On the way back from the north, Pembroke stopped in the village of Deddington in the Midlands, putting Gaveston under guard there while he went to visit his wife. The Earl of Warwick took this opportunity to seize Gaveston, taking him to Warwick Castle, where the Earl of Lancaster and the rest of his faction assembled on 18 June. At a brief trial, Gaveston was declared guilty of being a traitor under the terms of the Ordinances; he was beheaded on Blacklow Hill the following day, under the authority of Lancaster. Gaveston&#x27;s body was not buried until 1315, when his funeral was held in King&#x27;s Langley Priory.

===Tensions with Lancaster and France===
Reactions to the death of Gaveston varied considerably. Edward was furious and deeply upset over what he saw as the murder of Gaveston; he made provisions for Gaveston&#x27;s family, and intended to take revenge on the barons involved. The earls of Pembroke and Surrey were embarrassed and angry about Warwick&#x27;s actions, and shifted their support to Edward in the aftermath. To Lancaster and his core of supporters, the execution had been both legal and necessary to preserve the stability of the kingdom. Civil war again appeared likely, but in December, the Earl of Pembroke negotiated a potential peace treaty between the two sides, which would pardon the opposition barons for the killing of Gaveston, in exchange for their support for a fresh campaign in Scotland. Lancaster and Warwick, however, did not give the treaty their immediate approval, and further negotiations continued through most of 1313.

Meanwhile, the Earl of Pembroke had been negotiating with France to resolve the long-standing disagreements over the administration of Gascony, and as part of this Edward and Isabella agreed to travel to Paris in June 1313 to meet with Philip IV. Edward probably hoped both to resolve the problems in the south of France and to win Philip&#x27;s support in the dispute with the barons; for Philip it was an opportunity to impress his son-in-law with his power and wealth. It proved a spectacular visit, including a grand ceremony in which the two kings knighted Philip&#x27;s sons and two hundred other men in Notre-Dame de Paris, large banquets along the River Seine, and a public declaration that both kings and their queens would join a crusade to the Levant. Philip gave lenient terms for settling the problems in Gascony, and the event was spoiled only by a serious fire in Edward&#x27;s quarters.

On his return from France, Edward found his political position greatly strengthened. After intense negotiation, the earls, including Lancaster and Warwick, came to a compromise in October 1313, fundamentally very similar to the draft agreement of the previous December. Edward&#x27;s finances improved, thanks to parliament agreeing to the raising of taxes, a loan of 160,000 florins (£25,000) from the Pope, £33,000 borrowed from Philip, and further loans organised by Edward&#x27;s new Italian banker, Antonio Pessagno. For the first time in his reign, Edward&#x27;s government was well funded.

===Battle of Bannockburn===

By 1314, Robert the Bruce had recaptured most of the castles in Scotland once held by Edward, pushing raiding parties into northern England as far as Carlisle. In response, Edward planned a major military campaign with the support of Lancaster and the barons, mustering a large army between 15,000 and 20,000 strong. Meanwhile, Robert had besieged Stirling Castle, a key fortification in Scotland; its English commander had stated that unless Edward arrived by 24 June, he would surrender. News of this reached the king in late May, and he decided to speed up his march north from Berwick-upon-Tweed to relieve the castle. Robert, with between 5,500 and 6,500 troops, predominantly spearmen, prepared to prevent Edward&#x27;s forces from reaching Stirling.

The battle began on 23 June as the English army attempted to force its way across the high ground of the Bannock Burn, which was surrounded by marshland. Skirmishing between the two sides broke out, resulting in the death of Sir Henry de Bohun, whom Robert killed in personal combat. Edward continued his advance the following day, and encountered the bulk of the Scottish army as they emerged from the woods of New Park. Edward appears not to have expected the Scots to give battle here, and as a result had kept his forces in marching, rather than battle, order, with the archers—who would usually have been used to break up enemy spear formations—at the back of his army, rather than the front. His cavalry found it hard to operate in the cramped terrain and were crushed by Robert&#x27;s spearmen. The English army was overwhelmed and its leaders were unable to regain control.

Edward stayed behind to fight, but it became obvious to the Earl of Pembroke that the battle was lost and he dragged the king away from the battlefield, hotly pursued by the Scottish forces. Edward only just escaped the heavy fighting, making a vow to found a Carmelite religious house at Oxford if he survived. The historian Roy Haines describes the defeat as a &quot;calamity of stunning proportions&quot; for the English, whose losses in the battle were huge. In the aftermath of the defeat, Edward retreated to Dunbar, then travelled by ship to Berwick, and then back to York; in his absence, Stirling Castle quickly fell.

===Famine and criticism===
After the fiasco of Bannockburn, the Earls of Lancaster and Warwick saw their political influence increase, and they pressured Edward to re-implement the Ordinances of 1311. Lancaster became the head of the royal council in 1316, promising to take forward the Ordinances through a new reform commission, but he appears to have abandoned this role soon afterwards, partially because of disagreements with the other barons, and possibly because of ill-health. Lancaster refused to meet with Edward in parliament for the next two years, bringing effective governance to a standstill. This stymied any hopes for a fresh campaign into Scotland and raised fears of civil war. After much negotiation, once again involving the Earl of Pembroke, Edward and Lancaster finally agreed to the Treaty of Leake in August 1318, which pardoned Lancaster and his faction and established a new royal council, temporarily averting conflict.

Edward&#x27;s difficulties were exacerbated by prolonged problems in English agriculture, part of a wider phenomenon in northern Europe known as the Great Famine. It began with torrential rains in late 1314, followed by a very cold winter and heavy rains the following spring that killed many sheep and cattle. The bad weather continued, almost unabated, into 1321, resulting in a string of bad harvests. Revenues from the exports of wool plummeted and the price of food rose, despite attempts by Edward&#x27;s government to control prices. Edward called for hoarders to release food, and tried to encourage both internal trade and the importation of grain, but with little success. The requisitioning of provisions for the royal court during the famine years only added to tensions.

Meanwhile, Robert the Bruce exploited his victory at Bannockburn to raid northern England, initially attacking Carlisle and Berwick, and then reaching further south into Lancashire and Yorkshire, even threatening York itself. Edward undertook an expensive but unsuccessful campaign to stem the advance in 1319, but the famine made it increasingly difficult to keep his garrisons supplied with food. Meanwhile, a Scottish expedition led by Robert&#x27;s brother Edward Bruce successfully invaded Ireland in 1315. Edward Bruce declared himself the High King of Ireland. He was finally defeated in 1318 by Edward II&#x27;s Irish justiciar, Edmund Butler, at the Battle of Faughart, and Edward Bruce&#x27;s severed head was sent back to Edward II. Revolts also broke out in Lancashire and Bristol in 1315, and in Glamorgan in Wales in 1316, but were suppressed.

The famine and the Scottish policy were felt to be a punishment from God, and complaints about Edward multiplied, one contemporary poem describing the &quot;Evil Times of Edward II&quot;. Many criticised Edward&#x27;s &quot;improper&quot; and ignoble interest in rural pursuits. In 1318, a mentally ill man named John of Powderham appeared in Oxford, claiming that he was the real Edward II, and that Edward was a changeling, swapped at birth. John was duly executed, but his claims resonated with those criticising Edward for his lack of regal behaviour and steady leadership. Opposition also grew around Edward&#x27;s treatment of his royal favourites.

Edward had managed to retain some of his previous advisers, despite attempts by the Ordainers to remove them, and divided the extensive de Clare inheritance among two of his new favourites, the former household knights Hugh Audley and Roger Damory, instantly making them extremely rich. Many of the moderates who had helped deliver the peaceful compromise in 1318 now began to turn against Edward, making violence ever more likely.

==Later reign (1321–1326)==
===The Despenser War===

The long-threatened civil war finally broke out in England in 1321, triggered by the tension between many of the barons and the royal favourites, the Despenser family. Hugh Despenser the Elder had served both Edward and his father, while Hugh Despenser the Younger had married into the wealthy de Clare family, become the King&#x27;s chamberlain, and acquired Glamorgan in the Welsh Marches in 1317. Hugh the Younger subsequently expanded his holdings and power across Wales, mainly at the expense of the other Marcher Lords. The Earl of Lancaster and the Despensers were fierce enemies, and Lancaster&#x27;s antipathy was shared by most of the Despensers&#x27; neighbours, including the Earl of Hereford, the Mortimer family and the recently elevated Hugh Audley and Roger Damory. Edward, however, increasingly relied on the Despensers for advice and support, and he was particularly close to Hugh the Younger, whom one chronicler noted he &quot;loved ... dearly with all his heart and mind&quot;.

In early 1321, Lancaster mobilised a coalition of the Despensers&#x27; enemies across the Marcher territories. Edward and Hugh the Younger became aware of these plans in March and headed west, hoping that negotiations led by the moderate Earl of Pembroke would defuse the crisis. This time, Pembroke made his excuses and declined to intervene, and war broke out in May. The Despensers&#x27; lands were quickly seized by a coalition of the Marcher Lords and the local gentry, and Lancaster held a high-level gathering of the barons and clergy in June which condemned the Despensers for having broken the Ordinances. Edward attempted reconciliation, but in July the opposition occupied London and called for the permanent removal of the Despensers. Fearing that he might be deposed if he refused, Edward agreed to exile the Despensers and pardoned the Marcher Lords for their actions.

Edward began to plan his revenge. With the help of Pembroke, he formed a small coalition of his half-brothers, a few of the earls and some of the senior clergy, and prepared for war. Edward started with Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere, and Isabella was sent to Bartholomew&#x27;s stronghold, Leeds Castle, to deliberately create a &quot;casus belli&quot;. Bartholomew&#x27;s wife, Margaret, took the bait and her men killed several of Isabella&#x27;s retinue, giving Edward an excuse to intervene. Lancaster refused to help Bartholomew, his personal enemy, and Edward quickly regained control of south-east England. Alarmed, Lancaster now mobilised his own army in the north of England, and Edward mustered his own forces in the south-west. The Despensers returned from exile and were pardoned by the royal council.

In December, Edward led his army across the River Severn and advanced into the Welsh Marches, where the opposition forces had gathered. The coalition of Marcher Lords crumbled and the Mortimers surrendered to Edward, but Damory, Audley, and the Earl of Hereford marched north in January to join Lancaster, who had laid siege the king&#x27;s castle at Tickhill. Bolstered by fresh reinforcements from the Marcher Lords, Edward pursued them, meeting Lancaster&#x27;s army on 10 March at Burton-on-Trent. Lancaster, outnumbered, retreated without a fight, fleeing north. Andrew Harclay cornered Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge, and captured the earl. Edward and Hugh the Younger met Lancaster at Pontefract Castle, where, after a summary trial, the earl was found guilty of treason and beheaded.

===Edward and the Despensers===
Edward punished Lancaster&#x27;s supporters through a system of special courts across the country, with the judges instructed in advance how to sentence the accused, who were not allowed to speak in their own defence. Many of these so-called &quot;Contrariants&quot; were simply executed, and others were imprisoned or fined, with their lands seized and their surviving relatives detained. The Earl of Pembroke, whom Edward now mistrusted, was arrested; he was released only after pledging all his possessions as collateral for his own loyalty. Edward was able to reward his loyal supporters, especially the Despenser family, with the confiscated estates and new titles. The fines and confiscations made Edward rich: almost £15,000 was brought in during the first few months, and by 1326, Edward&#x27;s treasury contained £62,000. A parliament was held at York on 2 May 1322 at which the Ordinances were formally revoked through the Statute of York, and fresh taxes agreed for a new campaign against the Scots.

The English campaign against Scotland was planned on a massive scale, with a force of about 23,000 men. Edward advanced through Lothian towards Edinburgh, but Robert the Bruce declined to meet him in battle, drawing Edward further into Scotland. Plans to resupply the campaign by sea failed, and the large army rapidly ran out of food. Edward was forced to retreat south of the border, pursued by Scottish raiding parties. Edward&#x27;s illegitimate son, Adam, died during the campaign, and the raiding parties almost captured Isabella, who was staying at Tynemouth and was forced to flee by sea. Edward planned a fresh campaign, backed by a round of further taxes, but confidence in his Scottish policy was diminishing. Andrew Harclay, instrumental in securing Edward&#x27;s victories the previous year and recently made the Earl of Carlisle, independently negotiated a peace treaty with Robert the Bruce, proposing that Edward would recognise Robert as the King of Scotland and that, in return, Robert would cease to interfere in England. Edward was furious and immediately executed Harclay, but agreed to a thirteen-year truce with Robert.

Hugh Despenser the Younger lived and ruled in grand style, playing a leading role in Edward&#x27;s government, and executing policy through a wide network of family retainers. Supported by Chancellor Robert Baldock and Lord Treasurer Walter Stapledon, the Despensers accumulated land and wealth, using their position in government to provide superficial cover for what historian Seymour Phillips describes as &quot;the reality of fraud, threats of violence and abuse of legal procedure&quot;. Meanwhile, Edward faced growing opposition. Miracles were reported around the late Earl of Lancaster&#x27;s tomb, and at the gallows used to execute members of the opposition in Bristol. Law and order began to break down, encouraged by the chaos caused by the seizure of lands. The old opposition consisting of Marcher Lords&#x27; associates attempted to free the prisoners Edward held in Wallingford Castle, and Roger Mortimer, one of the most prominent of the imprisoned Marcher Lords, escaped from the Tower of London and fled to France.

===War with France===

The disagreements between Edward and the French Crown over the Duchy of Gascony led to the War of Saint-Sardos in 1324. Charles, Edward&#x27;s brother-in-law, had become King of France in 1322, and was more aggressive than his predecessors. In 1323, he insisted that Edward come to Paris to give homage for Gascony, and demanded that Edward&#x27;s administrators in Gascony allow French officials there to carry out orders given in Paris. Matters came to a head in October when a group of Edward&#x27;s soldiers hanged a French sergeant for attempting to build a new fortified town in the Agenais, a contested section of the Gascon border. Edward denied any responsibility for this incident, but relations between Edward and Charles soured. In 1324, Edward dispatched the Earl of Pembroke to Paris to broker a solution, but the earl died suddenly of an illness along the way. Charles mobilised his army and ordered the invasion of Gascony.

Edward&#x27;s forces in Gascony were around 4,400 strong, but the French army, commanded by Charles of Valois, numbered 7,000. Valois took the Agenais and then advanced further and cut off the main city of Bordeaux. In response, Edward ordered the arrest of any French persons in England and seized Isabella&#x27;s lands, on the basis that she was of French origin. In November 1324 he met with the earls and the English Church, who recommended that Edward should lead a force of 11,000 men to Gascony. Edward decided not to go personally, sending instead the Earl of Surrey. Meanwhile, Edward opened up fresh negotiations with the French king. Charles advanced various proposals, the most tempting of which was the suggestion that if Isabella and Prince Edward were to travel to Paris, and the prince was to give homage to Charles for Gascony, he would terminate the war and return the Agenais. Edward and his advisers had concerns about sending the prince to France, but agreed to send Isabella on her own as an envoy in March 1325.

==Fall from power (1326–1327)==
===Rift with Isabella===
Isabella, with Edward&#x27;s envoys, carried out negotiations with the French in late March. The negotiations proved difficult, and they arrived at a settlement only after Isabella personally intervened with her brother, Charles. The terms favoured the French Crown: In particular, Edward would give homage in person to Charles for Gascony. Concerned about the consequences of war breaking out once again, Edward agreed to the treaty but decided to give Gascony to his son, Edward, and sent the prince to give homage in Paris. The young Prince Edward crossed the English Channel and completed the bargain in September.

Edward now expected Isabella and their son to return to England, but instead she remained in France and showed no intention of making her way back. Until 1322, Edward and Isabella&#x27;s marriage appears to have been successful, but by the time Isabella left for France in 1325, it had deteriorated. Isabella appears to have disliked Hugh Despenser the Younger intensely, not least because of his abuse of high-status women. Isabella was embarrassed that she had fled from Scottish armies three times during her marriage to Edward, and she blamed Hugh for the final occurrence in 1322. When Edward had negotiated the recent truce with Robert the Bruce, he had severely disadvantaged a range of noble families who owned land in Scotland, including the Beaumonts, close friends of Isabella. She was also angry about the arrest of her household and seizure of her lands in 1324. Finally, Edward had taken away her children and given custody of them to Hugh Despenser&#x27;s wife.

By February 1326 it was clear that Isabella was involved in a relationship with an exiled Marcher Lord, Roger Mortimer. It is unclear when Isabella first met Mortimer or when their relationship began, but they both wanted to see Edward and the Despensers removed from power. Edward appealed for his son to return, and for Charles to intervene on his behalf, but this had no effect.

Edward&#x27;s opponents began to gather around Isabella and Mortimer in Paris, and Edward became increasingly anxious about the possibility that Mortimer might invade England. Isabella and Mortimer turned to William I, Count of Hainaut, and proposed a marriage between Prince Edward and William&#x27;s daughter, Philippa. In return for the advantageous alliance with the English heir to the throne, and a sizeable dower for the bride, William offered 132 transport vessels and eight warships to assist in the invasion of England. Prince Edward and Philippa were betrothed on 27 August, and Isabella and Mortimer prepared for their campaign.

===Invasion===

During August and September 1326, Edward mobilised his defences along the coasts of England to protect against the possibility of an invasion either by France or by Roger Mortimer. Fleets were gathered at the ports of Portsmouth in the south and Orwell on the east coast, and a raiding force of 1,600 men was sent across the English Channel into Normandy as a diversionary attack. Edward issued a nationalistic appeal for his subjects to defend the kingdom, but with little impact. The regime&#x27;s hold on power at the local level was fragile, the Despensers were widely disliked, and many of those Edward entrusted with the defence of the kingdom proved incompetent or promptly turned against the regime. Some 2,000 men were ordered to gather at Orwell to repel any invasion, but only 55 appear to have actually arrived.

Roger Mortimer, Isabella and thirteen-year-old Prince Edward, accompanied by King Edward&#x27;s half-brother Edmund of Woodstock, landed in Orwell on 24 September with a small force of men and met with no resistance. Instead, enemies of the Despensers moved rapidly to join them, including Edward&#x27;s other half-brother, Thomas of Brotherton; Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, who had inherited the earldom from his brother Thomas; and a range of senior clergy. Ensconced in the residence halls of the fortified and secure Tower of London, Edward attempted to garner support from within the capital. The city of London rose against his government, and on 2 October he left London, taking the Despensers with him. London descended into anarchy, as mobs attacked Edward&#x27;s remaining officials and associates, killing his former treasurer Walter Stapledon in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, and taking the Tower and releasing the prisoners inside.

Edward continued west up the Thames Valley, reaching Gloucester between 9 and 12 October; he hoped to reach Wales and from there mobilise an army against the invaders. Mortimer and Isabella were not far behind. Proclamations condemned the Despensers&#x27; recent regime. Day by day they gathered new supporters. Edward and the younger Despenser crossed over the border and set sail from Chepstow, probably aiming first for Lundy and then for Ireland, where the king hoped to receive refuge and raise a fresh army. Bad weather drove them back, though, and they landed at Cardiff. Edward retreated to Caerphilly Castle and attempted to rally his remaining forces.

Edward&#x27;s authority collapsed in England where, in his absence, Isabella&#x27;s faction took over the administration with the support of the Church. Her forces surrounded Bristol, where Hugh Despenser the Elder had taken shelter; he surrendered and was promptly executed. Edward and Hugh the Younger fled their castle around 2 November, leaving behind jewellery, considerable supplies, and at least £13,000 in cash, possibly once again hoping to reach Ireland, but on 16 November they were betrayed and captured by a search party north of Caerphilly. Edward was escorted first to Monmouth Castle, and from there back into England, where he was held at the Earl of Lancaster&#x27;s fortress at Kenilworth. Edward&#x27;s final remaining forces, by now besieged in Caerphilly Castle, surrendered after four months in March 1327.

===Abdication===

Isabella and Mortimer rapidly took revenge on the former regime. Hugh Despenser the Younger was put on trial, declared a traitor and sentenced to be disembowelled, castrated and quartered; he was duly executed on 24 November 1326. Edward&#x27;s former chancellor, Robert Baldock, died in Fleet Prison; the Earl of Arundel was beheaded. Edward&#x27;s position, however, was problematic; he was still married to Isabella and, in principle, he remained the king, but most of the new administration had much to lose were he to be released and potentially regain power.

There was no established procedure for removing an English king. Adam Orleton, the bishop of Hereford, made a series of public allegations about Edward&#x27;s conduct as king, and in January 1327 a parliament convened at Westminster at which the question of Edward&#x27;s future was raised; Edward refused to attend the gathering. Parliament, initially ambivalent, responded to the London crowds that called for the king&#x27;s son Edward to take the throne. On 12 January the leading barons and clergy agreed that Edward II should be removed and replaced by his son. The following day it was presented to an assembly of the barons, where it was argued that Edward&#x27;s weak leadership and personal faults had led the kingdom into disaster, and that he was incompetent to lead the country.

Shortly after this, a representative delegation of barons, clergy and knights was sent to Kenilworth to speak to the king. On 20 January 1327, the Earl of Lancaster and the bishops of Winchester and Lincoln met privately with Edward in the castle. They informed Edward that if he were to resign as monarch, his son Edward would succeed him, but if he failed to do so, his son might be disinherited as well, and the crown given to an alternative candidate. In tears, Edward agreed to abdicate, and on 21 January, Sir William Trussell, representing the kingdom as a whole, withdrew his homage and formally ended Edward&#x27;s reign. A proclamation was sent to London, announcing that Edward, now known as Edward of Caernarvon, had freely resigned his kingdom and that his son Edward would succeed him. The coronation took place at Westminster Abbey on 1 February 1327.

==Death (1327)==
===Death and aftermath===
Those opposed to the new government began to make plans to free Edward, and Roger Mortimer decided to move him to the more secure location of Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire, where Edward arrived around 5 April 1327. Once at the castle, he was kept in the custody of Mortimer&#x27;s son-in-law, Thomas de Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley, and John Maltravers, who were given £5 a day for Edward&#x27;s maintenance. It is unclear how well cared for Edward was; the records show luxury goods being bought on his behalf, but some chroniclers suggest that he was often mistreated. A poem, the &quot;Lament of Edward II&quot;, has been attributed to Edward during his imprisonment by some scholars, but this is disputed.

Concerns continued to be raised over fresh plots to liberate Edward, some involving the Dominican order and former household knights, and one such attempt got at least as far as breaking into the prison within the castle. As a result of these threats, Edward was moved around to other locations in secret for a period, before returning to permanent custody at the castle in late summer 1327. The political situation remained unstable, and new plots appear to have been formed to free him.

On 23 September Edward III was informed that his father had died at Berkeley Castle during the night of 21 September. Most historians agree that Edward II did die at Berkeley on that date, although there is a minority view that he died much later. His death was, as Mark Ormrod notes, &quot;suspiciously timely&quot;, as it simplified Mortimer&#x27;s political problems considerably, and most historians believe that Edward was probably murdered on the orders of the new regime, although it is impossible to be certain. Several of the individuals suspected of involvement in the death, including Sir Thomas Gurney, Maltravers and , later fled. If Edward died from natural causes, his death may have been hastened by depression following his imprisonment.

The rule of Isabella and Mortimer did not last long after the announcement of Edward&#x27;s death. They made peace with the Scots in the Treaty of Northampton, but this move was highly unpopular. Isabella and Mortimer both amassed and spent great wealth, and criticism of them mounted. Relations between Mortimer and Edward III became strained and in 1330 the king conducted a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; at Nottingham Castle. He arrested Mortimer and then executed him on fourteen charges of treason, including the murder of Edward II. Edward III&#x27;s government sought to blame Mortimer for all the recent problems, effectively politically rehabilitating Edward II. Edward III placed his mother under arrest, but she was released soon after.

===Burial and cult===
Edward&#x27;s body was embalmed at Berkeley Castle, where it was viewed by local leaders from Bristol and Gloucester. It was then taken to Gloucester Abbey on 21 October, and on 20 December, Edward was buried by the high altar, the funeral having probably been delayed to allow Edward III to attend in person. Gloucester was probably chosen because other abbeys had refused or been forbidden to take the king&#x27;s body, and because it was close to Berkeley. The funeral was a grand affair and cost £351 in total, complete with gilt lions, standards painted with gold leaf and oak barriers to manage the anticipated crowds. Edward III&#x27;s government probably hoped to put a veneer of normality over the recent political events, increasing the legitimacy of the young king&#x27;s own reign.

A temporary wooden effigy with a copper crown was made for the funeral; this is the first known use of a funeral effigy in England, and was probably necessary because of the condition of the King&#x27;s body, as he had been dead for three months. Edward&#x27;s heart was removed, placed in a silver container, and later buried with Isabella at Newgate Church in London. His tomb includes a very early example of an English alabaster effigy, with a tomb chest and a canopy made of oolite and Purbeck stone. Edward was buried in the shirt, coif and gloves from his coronation, and his effigy depicts him as king, holding a sceptre and orb, and wearing a strawberry-leaf crown. The effigy features a pronounced lower lip, and may be a close likeness of Edward.

Edward II&#x27;s tomb rapidly became a popular site for visitors, probably encouraged by the local monks, who lacked an existing pilgrimage attraction. Visitors donated extensively to the abbey, allowing the monks to rebuild much of the surrounding church in the 1330s. Miracles reportedly took place at the tomb, and modifications had to be made to enable visitors to walk around it in larger numbers. The chronicler Geoffrey le Baker depicted Edward as a saintly, tortured martyr, and Richard II gave royal support for an unsuccessful bid to have Edward canonised in 1395. The tomb was opened by officials in 1855, uncovering a wooden coffin, still in good condition, and a sealed lead coffin inside it. The tomb remains in what is now Gloucester Cathedral, and was extensively restored in 2007 and 2008 at a cost of over £100,000.

===Controversies===
Controversy rapidly surrounded Edward&#x27;s death. With Mortimer&#x27;s execution in 1330, rumours began to circulate that Edward had been murdered at Berkeley Castle. Accounts that he had been killed by the insertion of a red-hot iron or poker into his anus slowly began to spread, possibly as a result of deliberate propaganda; chroniclers in the mid-1330s and 1340s disseminated this account further, supported in later years by Geoffrey le Baker&#x27;s colourful account of the killing. It became incorporated into most later histories of Edward, typically being linked to his possible homosexuality. Most historians now dismiss this account of Edward&#x27;s death, querying the logic in his captors murdering him in such an easily detectable fashion.
Another set of theories surround the possibility that Edward did not really die in 1327. These theories typically involve the &quot;Fieschi Letter&quot;, sent to Edward III by an Italian priest called Manuel Fieschi, who claimed that Edward escaped Berkeley Castle in 1327 with the help of a servant and ultimately retired to become a hermit in the Holy Roman Empire. The body buried at Gloucester Cathedral was said to be that of the porter of Berkeley Castle, killed by the assassins and presented by them to Isabella as Edward&#x27;s corpse to avoid punishment. The letter is often linked to an account of Edward III meeting with a man called William the Welshman in Antwerp in 1338, who claimed to be Edward II. Some parts of the letter&#x27;s content are considered broadly accurate by historians, although other aspects of its account have been criticised as implausible. A few historians have supported versions of its narrative. Paul C. Doherty questions the veracity of the letter and the identity of William the Welshman, but nonetheless has suspicions that Edward may have survived his imprisonment. The popular historian Alison Weir believes the events in the letter to be essentially true, using the letter to argue that Isabella was innocent of murdering Edward. and Natalie Fryde has claimed that Edward&#x27;s survival is &quot;a possibility&quot;. The historian Ian Mortimer suggests that the story in Fieschi&#x27;s letter is broadly accurate, but argues that it was in fact Mortimer and Isabella who had Edward secretly released, and who then faked his death, a fiction later maintained by Edward III when he came to power. Ian Mortimer&#x27;s account was criticised by most scholars when it was first published, in particular by historian David Carpenter, who argues that there is no &quot;convincing evidence for Edward’s survival, let alone for it being the result of a Mortimer plot”.

==Edward as king==
===Kingship, government and law===
Edward was ultimately a failure as a king; the historian Michael Prestwich observes that he &quot;was lazy and incompetent, liable to outbursts of temper over unimportant issues, yet indecisive when it came to major issues&quot;, echoed by Roy Haines&#x27; description of Edward as &quot;incompetent and vicious&quot;, and as &quot;no man of business&quot;. Edward did not just delegate routine government to his subordinates, but also higher level decision making, and Pierre Chaplais argues that he &quot;was not so much an incompetent king as a reluctant one&quot;, preferring to rule through a powerful deputy, such as Piers Gaveston or Hugh Despenser the Younger. Edward&#x27;s willingness to promote his favourites had serious political consequences, although he also attempted to buy the loyalty of a wider grouping of nobles through grants of money and fees. He could take a keen interest in the minutiae of administration, however, and on occasion engaged in the details of a wide range of issues across England and his wider domains.

One of Edward&#x27;s persistent challenges through most of his reign was a shortage of money; of the debts he inherited from his father, around £60,000 was still owing in the 1320s. Edward worked his way through many treasurers and other financial officials, few of whom stayed long, raising revenues through often unpopular taxes, and requisitioning goods using his right of prise. He also took out many loans, first through the Frescobaldi family, and then through his banker Antonio Pessagno. Edward took a strong interest in financial matters towards the end of his reign, distrusting his own officials and directly cutting back on the expenses of his own household.

Edward was responsible for implementing royal justice through his network of judges and officials. It is uncertain to what extent Edward took a personal interest in dispensing justice, but he appears to have involved himself to some degree during the first part of his reign, and to have increasingly intervened in person after 1322. Edward made extensive use of Roman civil law during his reign when arguing in defence of his causes and favourites, which may have attracted criticism from those who perceived this as abandoning the established principles of English common law. Edward was also criticised by contemporaries for allowing the Despensers to exploit the royal justice system for their own ends; the Despensers certainly appear to have abused the system, although just how widely they did so is unclear. Amid the political turbulence, armed gangs and violence spread across England under Edward&#x27;s reign, destabilising the position of many of the local gentry; much of Ireland similarly disintegrated into anarchy.

Under Edward&#x27;s rule, parliament&#x27;s importance grew as a means of making political decisions and answering petitions, although as the historian Claire Valente notes, the gatherings were &quot;still as much an event as an institution&quot;. After 1311, parliament began to include, in addition to the barons, the representatives of the knights and burgesses, who in later years would constitute the &quot;commons&quot;. Although parliament often opposed raising fresh taxes, active opposition to Edward came largely from the barons, rather than parliament itself, although the barons did seek to use the parliamentary meetings as a way of giving legitimacy to their long-standing political demands. After resisting it for many years, Edward began intervening in parliament in the second half of his reign to achieve his own political aims. It remains unclear whether he was deposed in 1327 by a formal gathering of parliament or simply a gathering of the political classes alongside an existing parliament.

===Court===
Edward&#x27;s royal court was itinerant, travelling around the country with him. When housed in Westminster Palace, the court occupied a complex of two halls, seven chambers and three chapels, along with other smaller rooms, but, due to the Scottish conflict, the court spent much of its time in Yorkshire and Northumbria. At the heart of the court was Edward&#x27;s royal household, in turn divided into the &quot;hall&quot; and the &quot;chamber&quot;; the size of the household varied over time, but in 1317 was around five hundred people, including household knights, squires, and kitchen and transport staff. The household was surrounded by a wider group of courtiers, and appears to have also attracted a circle of prostitutes and criminal elements.

Music and minstrels were very popular at Edward&#x27;s court, but hunting appears to have been a much less important activity, and there was little emphasis on chivalric events. Edward was interested in buildings and paintings, but less so in literary works, which were not extensively sponsored at court. There was an extensive use of gold and silver plates, jewels and enamelling at court, which would have been richly decorated. Edward kept a camel as a pet and, as a young man, took a lion with him on campaign to Scotland. The court could be entertained in exotic ways: by an Italian snake-charmer in 1312, and the following year by 54 nude French dancers.

===Religion===
Edward&#x27;s approach to religion was normal for the period, and the historian Michael Prestwich describes him as &quot;a man of wholly conventional religious attitudes&quot;. There were daily chapel services and almsgiving at his court, and Edward blessed the sick, although he did this less often than his predecessors. Edward remained close to the Dominican Order, which had helped to educate him, and followed their advice in asking for papal permission to be anointed with the Holy Oil of St. Thomas of Canterbury in 1319; this request was refused, causing the king some embarrassment. Edward supported the expansion of the universities during his reign, establishing King&#x27;s Hall in Cambridge to promote training in religious and civil law, Oriel College in Oxford and a short-lived university in Dublin.

Edward enjoyed a good relationship with Pope Clement V, despite the king&#x27;s repeated intervention in the operation of the English Church, including punishing bishops with whom he disagreed. With Clement&#x27;s support, Edward attempted to gain the financial support of the English Church for his military campaigns in Scotland, including taxation and borrowing money against the funds gathered for the crusades. The Church did relatively little to influence or moderate Edward&#x27;s behaviour during his reign, possibly because of the bishops&#x27; self-interest and concern for their own protection.

Pope John XXII, elected in 1316, sought Edward&#x27;s support for a new crusade, and was also inclined to support him politically. In 1317, in exchange for papal support in his war with Scotland, Edward agreed to recommence paying the annual Papal tribute, which had been first agreed to by King John in 1213; Edward soon ceased the payments, however, and never offered his homage, another part of the 1213 agreement. In 1325 Edward asked Pope John to instruct the Irish Church to openly preach in favour of his right to rule the island, and to threaten to excommunicate any contrary voices.

==Legacy==
===Historiography===
No chronicler for this period is entirely trustworthy or unbiased, often because their accounts were written to support a particular cause, but it is clear that most contemporary chroniclers were highly critical of Edward. The &quot;Polychronicon&quot;, &quot;Vita Edwardi Secundi&quot;, &quot;Vita et Mors Edwardi Secundi&quot; and the &quot;Gesta Edwardi de Carnarvon&quot; for example all condemned the king&#x27;s personality, habits and choice of companions. Other records from his reign show criticism by his contemporaries, including the Church and members of his own household. Political songs were written about him, complaining about his failure in war and his oppressive government. Later in the 14th century, some chroniclers, such as Geoffrey le Baker and Thomas Ringstead, rehabilitated Edward, presenting him as a martyr and a potential saint, although this tradition died out in later years.

Historians in the 16th and 17th centuries focused on Edward&#x27;s relationship with Gaveston, drawing comparisons between Edward&#x27;s reign and the events surrounding the relationship of Jean Louis de Nogaret de La Valette, Duke of Épernon, and Henry III of France, and between George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and Charles I of England. In the first half of the 19th century, popular historians such as Charles Dickens and Charles Knight popularised Edward&#x27;s life with the Victorian public, focusing on the king&#x27;s relationship with his favourites and, increasingly, alluding to his possible homosexuality. From the 1870s onwards, however, open academic discussion of Edward&#x27;s sexuality was circumscribed by changing English values. By the start of the 20th century, English schools were being advised by the government to avoid overt discussion of Edward&#x27;s personal relationships in history lessons. Views on his sexuality have continued to develop over the years.

By the end of the 19th century, more administrative records from the period had become available to historians such as William Stubbs, Thomas Tout and J. C. Davies, who focused on the development of the English constitutional and governmental system during his reign. Although critical of what they regarded as Edward II&#x27;s inadequacies as a king, they also emphasised the growth of the role of parliament and the reduction in personal royal authority under Edward, which they perceived as positive developments. During the 1970s the historiography of Edward&#x27;s reign shifted away from this model, supported by the further publishing of records from the period in the last quarter of the 20th century. The work of Jeffrey Denton, Jeffrey Hamilton, John Maddicott and Seymour Phillips re-focused attention on the role of the individual leaders in the conflicts. With the exceptions of Hilda Johnstone&#x27;s work on Edward&#x27;s early years and Natalie Fryde&#x27;s study of Edward&#x27;s final years, the focus of the major historical studies for several years was on the leading magnates rather than Edward himself, until substantial biographies of the king were published by Roy Haines and Seymour Phillips in 2003 and 2011.

===Cultural references===

Several plays have shaped Edward&#x27;s contemporary image. Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s play &quot;Edward II&quot; was first performed around 1592 and focuses on Edward&#x27;s relationship with Piers Gaveston, reflecting 16th-century concerns about the relationships between monarchs and their favourites. Marlowe presents Edward&#x27;s death as a murder, drawing parallels between the killing and martyrdom; although Marlowe does not describe the actual nature of Edward&#x27;s murder in the script, it has usually been performed following the tradition that Edward was killed with a red-hot poker. The character of Edward in the play, who has been likened to Marlowe&#x27;s contemporaries James VI of Scotland and Henry III of France, may have influenced William Shakespeare&#x27;s portrayal of Richard II. In the 17th century, the playwright Ben Jonson picked up the same theme for his unfinished work, &quot;Mortimer His Fall&quot;.

The filmmaker Derek Jarman adapted the Marlowe play into a film in 1991, creating a postmodern pastiche of the original, depicting Edward as a strong, explicitly homosexual leader, ultimately overcome by powerful enemies. In Jarman&#x27;s version, Edward finally escapes captivity, following the tradition in the Fieschi letter. Edward&#x27;s current popular image was also shaped by his contrasting appearance in Mel Gibson&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Braveheart&quot;, where he is portrayed as weak and implicitly homosexual, wearing silk clothes and heavy makeup, shunning the company of women and incapable of dealing militarily with the Scots. The film received extensive criticism, both for its historical inaccuracies and for its negative portrayal of homosexuality.
Edward&#x27;s life has also been used in a wide variety of other media. In the Victorian era, the painting &quot;Edward II and Piers Gaveston&quot; by Marcus Stone strongly hinted at a homosexual relationship between the pair, while avoiding making this aspect explicit. It was initially shown at the Royal Academy in 1872 but was marginalised in later decades as the issue of homosexuality became more sensitive. More recently, the director David Bintley used Marlowe&#x27;s play as the basis for the ballet &quot;Edward II&quot;, first performed in 1995; the music from the ballet forms a part of composer John McCabe&#x27;s symphony &quot;Edward II&quot;, produced in 2000. Novels such as John Penford&#x27;s 1984 &quot;The Gascon&quot; and Chris Hunt&#x27;s 1992 &quot;Gaveston&quot; have focused on the sexual aspects of Edward and Gaveston&#x27;s relationship, while Stephanie Merritt&#x27;s 2002 &quot;Gaveston&quot; transports the story into the 20th century.

==Issue==

<doc id="44849" wikidata="Q35332" url="?curid=44849" title="Brad Pitt">
<text>William Bradley Pitt (born December 18, 1963) is an American actor and film producer. He is the recipient of various accolades, including two Academy Awards, two British Academy Film Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and a Primetime Emmy Award. One of the most influential celebrities, Pitt appeared on &quot;Forbes&quot;″ annual Celebrity 100 list from 2006 to 2008, and the &quot;Time&quot; 100 list in 2007. As of 2025, his films have grossed over $6.9billion worldwide.

Pitt first gained recognition as a cowboy hitchhiker in the Ridley Scott road film &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; (1991). Pitt emerged as a star taking on leading man roles in films such as the drama &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot; (1992), the western &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; (1994), the horror film &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; (1994), the crime thriller &quot;Seven&quot; (1995), and the cult film &quot;Fight Club&quot; (1999). Pitt found greater commercial success starring in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s heist film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; (2001), and reprised his role in its sequels. He cemented his leading man status starring in blockbusters such as the historical epic &quot;Troy&quot; (2004), the romantic crime film &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot; (2005), the horror film &quot;World War Z&quot; (2013), and the action film &quot;Bullet Train&quot; (2022).

Pitt won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for playing a stuntman in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot; (2019). He was Oscar-nominated for his roles in the science fiction drama &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; (1995), the fantasy romance &quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&quot; (2008) and the sports drama &quot;Moneyball&quot; (2011). He also starred in acclaimed films such as &quot;Babel&quot; (2006), &quot;The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford&quot; (2007), &quot;Burn After Reading&quot; (2008), &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; (2009), &quot;The Tree of Life&quot; (2011), and &quot;The Big Short&quot; (2015).

In 2001, Pitt co-founded the production company Plan B Entertainment. As a producer he won the Academy Award for Best Picture for &quot;12 Years a Slave&quot; (2013) and was nominated for &quot;Moneyball&quot; (2011) and &quot;The Big Short&quot; (2015). Pitt was named &quot;People&#x27;s&quot; Sexiest Man Alive in 1995 and 2000.

==Early life==
William Bradley Pitt was born on December 18, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma, to William Alvin Pitt, the proprietor of a trucking company, and Jane Etta (née Hillhouse), a school counselor. The family soon moved to Springfield, Missouri, where he lived together with his younger siblings, Douglas Pitt (born 1966) and Julie (née Pitt) Neal (born 1969). Born into a conservative Christian household, he was raised as Southern Baptist and later &quot;oscillate[d] between agnosticism and atheism&quot;. He later reconciled his belief in spirituality. Pitt has described Springfield as &quot;Mark Twain country, Jesse James country&quot;, having grown up with &quot;a lot of hills, a lot of lakes&quot;.

Pitt attended Kickapoo High School, where he was a member of the golf, swimming, and tennis teams. He participated in the school&#x27;s Key and Forensics clubs, in school debates, and in musicals. Following his graduation from high school, Pitt enrolled in the University of Missouri in 1982, majoring in journalism with a focus on advertising. As graduation approached, Pitt did not feel ready to settle down. He loved films—&quot;a portal into different worlds for me&quot;—and, since films were not made in Missouri, he decided to go to where they were made. Two weeks short of completing the coursework for a degree, Pitt left the university and moved to Los Angeles, where he took acting lessons and worked odd jobs. He has named Gary Oldman, Sean Penn, and Mickey Rourke as his early acting heroes.

==Career==
=== Early work (1987–1993) ===
While struggling to establish himself in Los Angeles, Pitt took lessons from acting coach Roy London. His acting career began in 1987, with uncredited parts in the films &quot;No Way Out&quot; (1987), &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; (1987) and &quot;Less than Zero&quot; (1987). In May 1987, he made his television debut in a two-episode role on the NBC soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;. In November of the same year, Pitt had a guest appearance on the CBS sitcom &quot;Trial and Error&quot; and the ABC sitcom &quot;Growing Pains&quot;. He appeared in four episodes of the CBS primetime series &quot;Dallas&quot; between December 1987 and February 1988 as Randy, the boyfriend of Jenna Wade&#x27;s daughter Charlotte (played by Shalane McCall). Later in 1988, Pitt made a guest appearance on the Fox police drama &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;. In the same year, the Yugoslavian–U.S. co-production &quot;The Dark Side of the Sun&quot; (1988) was his first leading film role, starring as a young American taken by his family to the Adriatic to find a remedy for a skin condition. The film was shelved at the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence, and was not released until 1997. Pitt made two motion picture appearances in 1989: the first in a supporting role in the comedy &quot;Happy Together&quot;; the second a featured role in the horror film &quot;Cutting Class&quot;, the first of Pitt&#x27;s films to reach theaters. He made guest appearances on television series &quot;Head of the Class&quot;, &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Nightmares&quot;, &quot;Thirtysomething&quot;, and (for a second time) &quot;Growing Pains&quot;.

Pitt was cast as Billy Canton, a drug addict who takes advantage of a young runaway (played by Juliette Lewis) in the 1990 NBC television movie &quot;Too Young to Die?&quot;, the story of an abused teenager sentenced to death for a murder. Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;Pitt is a magnificent slimeball as her hoody boyfriend; looking and sounding like a malevolent John Cougar Mellencamp, he&#x27;s really scary.&quot; The same year, Pitt co-starred in six episodes of the short-lived Fox drama &quot;Glory Days&quot; and took a supporting role in the HBO television film &quot;The Image&quot;. His next appearance came in the 1991 film &quot;Across the Tracks&quot;; Pitt portrayed Joe Maloney, a high school runner with a criminal brother, played by Rick Schroder. The same year he featured in a Levi&#x27;s jeans TV commercial based around the song &quot;20th Century Boy&quot; which played in the background.

After years of supporting roles in film and frequent television guest appearances, Pitt attracted wider recognition in his supporting role in Ridley Scott&#x27;s 1991 road film &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot;. He played J.D., a small-time criminal who befriends Thelma (Geena Davis). His love scene with Davis has been cited as the event that defined Pitt as a sex symbol. After &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot;, Pitt starred in the 1991 film &quot;Johnny Suede&quot;, a low-budget picture about an aspiring rock star, and the 1992 live-action/animated fantasy film &quot;Cool World&quot;, although neither furthered his career, having poor reviews and box office performance.

Pitt took on the role of Paul Maclean in the 1992 biographical film &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;, directed by Robert Redford. His portrayal of the character was described by &quot;People&quot;″s Janet Mock as a career-making performance, proving that Pitt could be more than a &quot;cowboy-hatted hunk.&quot; He has admitted to feeling under pressure when making the film and thought it was one of his &quot;weakest performances ... It&#x27;s so weird that it ended up being the one that I got the most attention for.&quot; Pitt believed that he benefited from working with such a talented cast and crew. He compared working with Redford to playing tennis with a superior player, saying &quot;when you play with somebody better than you, your game gets better.&quot; In 1993, Pitt reunited with Juliette Lewis for the road film &quot;Kalifornia&quot;. He played Early Grayce, a serial killer and the abusive husband of Lewis&#x27; character, in a performance described by Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;outstanding, all boyish charm and then a snort that exudes pure menace.&quot; Pitt also garnered attention for a brief appearance in the cult hit &quot;True Romance&quot; as a stoner named Floyd, providing comic relief to the action film. He capped the year by winning a ShoWest Award for Male Star of Tomorrow.

=== Breakthrough (1994–1998) ===
In 1994, Pitt portrayed the vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac in the horror film &quot;Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles&quot;, based on Anne Rice&#x27;s 1976 novel of the same name. He was part of an ensemble cast that included Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst, Christian Slater, and Antonio Banderas. Despite his winning two MTV Movie Awards at the 1995 ceremony, his performance was poorly received. According to the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot;, &quot;Brad Pitt [...] is a large part of the problem [in the film]. When directors play up his cocky, hunkish, folksy side [...] he&#x27;s a joy to watch. But there&#x27;s nothing about him that suggests inner torment or even self-awareness, which makes him a boring Louis.&quot;

Following the release of &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, Pitt starred in &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; (1994), based on a novel by the same name by Jim Harrison, set in the American West during the first four decades of the twentieth century. Portraying Tristan Ludlow, son of Colonel William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) a Cornish immigrant, Pitt received his first Golden Globe Award nomination, in the Best Actor category. Aidan Quinn and Henry Thomas co-starred as Pitt&#x27;s brothers. Although the film&#x27;s reception was mixed, many film critics praised Pitt&#x27;s performance. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;Pitt&#x27;s diffident mix of acting and attitude works to such heartthrob perfection it&#x27;s a shame the film&#x27;s superficiality gets in his way.&quot; The &quot;Deseret News&quot; predicted that &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; would solidify Pitt&#x27;s reputation as a lead actor.

In 1995, Pitt starred alongside Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey in the crime thriller &quot;Seven&quot;, playing a detective on the trail of a serial killer who preys on people he considers guilty of the Seven Deadly Sins. Pitt called it a great movie and declared the part would expand his acting horizons. He expressed his intent to move on from &quot;this &#x27;pretty boy&#x27; thing [...] and play someone with flaws.&quot; His performance was critically well received, with &quot;Variety&quot; saying that it was screen acting at its best, further remarking on Pitt&#x27;s ability to turn in a &quot;determined, energetic, creditable job&quot; as the detective. &quot;Seven&quot; earned $327 million at the international box office. Following the success of &quot;Seven&quot;, Pitt played psychotic anarchist Jeffrey Goines in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s 1995 science fiction film &quot;12 Monkeys&quot;. The movie received predominantly positive reviews, with Pitt praised in particular. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;Twelve Monkeys&quot; &quot;fierce and disturbing&quot; and remarked on Pitt&#x27;s &quot;startlingly frenzied performance&quot;, concluding that he &quot;electrifies Jeffrey with a weird magnetism that becomes important later in the film.&quot; He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor for the film and received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

The following year, he appeared in the legal drama &quot;Sleepers&quot; (1996), based on Lorenzo Carcaterra&#x27;s novel of the same name. The film received mixed reviews. In the 1997 film &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Own&quot; Pitt starred, opposite Harrison Ford, as Irish Republican Army terrorist Rory Devany, a role for which he was required to learn an Irish accent. Critical opinion was divided on his accent; &quot;Pitt finds the right tone of moral ambiguity, but at times his Irish brogue is too convincing – it&#x27;s hard to understand what he&#x27;s saying&quot;, wrote the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle.&quot; &quot;The Charleston Gazette&quot; opined that it had favored Pitt&#x27;s accent over the movie. &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Own&quot; grossed $140 million worldwide.

Later that year, he led as Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer in the Jean-Jacques Annaud film &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot;. Pitt trained for months for the role, which demanded significant mountain climbing and trekking practice, including rock climbing in California and the European Alps with his co-star David Thewlis. Pitt had the lead role in 1998&#x27;s fantasy romance film &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot;. He portrayed a personification of death inhabiting the body of a young man to learn what it is like to be human. The film received mixed reviews, and many were critical of Pitt&#x27;s performance. According to Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Pitt was unable to &quot;make an audience believe that he knows all the mysteries of death and eternity.&quot; Roger Ebert remarked, &quot;Pitt is a fine actor, but this performance is a miscalculation.&quot;

=== Rise to prominence (1999–2003) ===
In 1999, Pitt portrayed Tyler Durden in &quot;Fight Club&quot;, a film adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk&#x27;s novel of the same name, directed by David Fincher. Pitt prepared for the part with lessons in boxing, taekwondo, and grappling. To look the part, Pitt consented to the removal of pieces of his front teeth which were restored when filming ended. While promoting &quot;Fight Club&quot;, Pitt said that the film explored not taking one&#x27;s aggressions out on someone else but to &quot;have an experience, take a punch more and see how you come out on the other end.&quot; &quot;Fight Club&quot; premiered at the 1999 Venice International Film Festival. Despite divided critical opinion on the film as a whole, Pitt&#x27;s performance was widely praised. Paul Clinton of CNN noted the risky yet successful nature of the film, while &quot;Variety&quot; remarked upon Pitt&#x27;s ability to be &quot;cool, charismatic and more dynamically physical, perhaps than [...] his breakthrough role in &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot;&quot;. In spite of a worse-than-expected box office performance, &quot;Fight Club&quot; became a cult classic after its DVD release in 2000.

Pitt was cast as an Irish Traveller boxer with a barely intelligible accent in Guy Ritchie&#x27;s 2000 gangster film &quot;Snatch&quot;. Several reviewers were critical of &quot;Snatch&quot;; however, most praised Pitt. Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said Pitt was &quot;ideally cast as an Irishman whose accent is so thick even Brits can&#x27;t understand him&quot;, going on to say that, before &quot;Snatch&quot;, Pitt had been &quot;shackled by roles that called for brooding introspection, but recently he has found his calling in black comic outrageousness and flashy extroversion;&quot; while Amy Taubin of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; claimed that &quot;Pitt gets maximum comic mileage out of a one-joke role&quot;.

The following year Pitt starred opposite Julia Roberts in the romantic comedy &quot;The Mexican&quot;, a film that garnered a range of reviews but enjoyed box office success. Pitt&#x27;s next role, in 2001&#x27;s $143 million-grossing Cold War thriller &quot;Spy Game&quot;, was as Tom Bishop, an operative of the CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Division, mentored by Robert Redford&#x27;s character. Mark Holcomb of Salon.com enjoyed the film, although he noted that neither Pitt nor Redford provided &quot;much of an emotional connection for the audience&quot;.

On November 22, 2001, Pitt made a guest appearance in the eighth season of the television series &quot;Friends&quot;, playing a man with a grudge against Rachel Green, played by Jennifer Aniston, to whom Pitt was married at the time. For this performance he was nominated for an Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series. In December 2001, Pitt played Rusty Ryan in the heist film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot;, a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack original. He joined an ensemble cast including George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy García, and Julia Roberts. Well received by critics, &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; was highly successful at the box office, earning $450 million worldwide.

Pitt appeared in two episodes of MTV&#x27;s reality series &quot;Jackass&quot; in February 2002, first running through the streets of Los Angeles with several cast members in gorilla suits, and in a subsequent episode participating in his own staged abduction. In the same year, Pitt had a cameo role in George Clooney&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot;. He took on his first voice-acting roles in 2003, speaking as the titular character of the DreamWorks animated film &quot;&quot; and playing Boomhauer&#x27;s brother, Patch, in an episode of the animated television series &quot;King of the Hill&quot;.

=== Worldwide recognition (2004–2008) ===
Pitt had two major film roles in 2004, starring as Achilles in &quot;Troy&quot;, and reprising his role, Rusty Ryan, in the sequel &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot;. He spent six months sword training before the filming of &quot;Troy&quot;, based on the &quot;Iliad&quot;. An on-set injury to his Achilles tendon delayed production on the picture for several weeks. Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated that Pitt excelled at such a demanding role. &quot;Troy&quot; was the first film produced by Plan B Entertainment, a film production company he had founded two years earlier with Jennifer Aniston and Brad Grey, CEO of Paramount Pictures. &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; earned $362 million worldwide, and Pitt and Clooney&#x27;s dynamic was described by CNN&#x27;s Paul Clinton as &quot;the best male chemistry since Paul Newman and Robert Redford.&quot; In 2005, Pitt starred as John Smith in the Doug Liman-directed action comedy &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot;, in which a bored married couple discover that each is an assassin sent to kill the other. The feature received reasonable reviews but was generally lauded for the chemistry between Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who played his character&#x27;s wife Jane Smith. The &quot;Star Tribune&quot; noted that &quot;while the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars&#x27; thermonuclear screen chemistry&quot;. &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot; earned $478 million worldwide, making it one of the biggest hits of 2005.

For his next film, Pitt starred opposite Cate Blanchett in Alejandro González Iñárritu&#x27;s multi-narrative drama &quot;Babel&quot; (2006). Pitt&#x27;s performance was critically well-received, and the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; said that he was credible and gave the film visibility. Pitt later said he regarded taking the part as one of the best decisions of his career. The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and was later featured at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival. &quot;Babel&quot; received seven Academy and Golden Globe award nominations, winning the Best Drama Golden Globe, and earned Pitt a nomination for the Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe. That same year, Pitt&#x27;s company Plan B Entertainment produced &quot;The Departed&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Pitt was credited on-screen as a producer; however, only Graham King was ruled eligible for the Oscar win.

Reprising his role as Rusty Ryan in a third picture, Pitt starred in 2007&#x27;s &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Thirteen&quot;. While less lucrative than the first two films, this sequel earned $311 million at the international box office. Pitt&#x27;s next film role was as American outlaw Jesse James in the 2007 Western drama &quot;The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford&quot;, adapted from Ron Hansen&#x27;s 1983 novel of the same name. Directed by Andrew Dominik and produced by Pitt&#x27;s company Plan B Entertainment, the film premiered at the 2007 Venice Film Festival, with Pitt playing a &quot;scary and charismatic&quot; role, according to Lewis Beale of &quot;Film Journal International&quot;, and earning Pitt the Volpi Cup award for Best Actor at the 64th Venice International Film Festival. He eventually collected the award one year later at the 2008 festival. As of January 2019, it was his own favorite of his films.

Pitt&#x27;s next appearance was in the 2008 black comedy &quot;Burn After Reading&quot;, his first collaboration with the Coen brothers. The film received a positive reception from critics, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; calling it &quot;a tightly wound, slickly plotted spy comedy&quot;, noting that Pitt&#x27;s performance was one of the funniest. He was later cast as Benjamin Button, the lead in David Fincher&#x27;s 2008 film &quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&quot;, a loosely adapted version of a 1921 short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The story follows a man who is born an octogenarian and ages in reverse, with Pitt&#x27;s &quot;sensitive&quot; performance making &quot;Benjamin Button&quot; a &quot;timeless masterpiece&quot;, according to Michael Sragow of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;. The performance earned Pitt his first Screen Actors Guild Award nomination, as well as a fourth Golden Globe and second Academy Award nomination, all in the category for Best Actor. The film received thirteen Academy Award nominations, and grossed $329 million at the box office worldwide.

=== Established actor (2009–present) ===
Pitt&#x27;s next leading role came in 2009 with the Quentin Tarantino-directed war film &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;, which premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. Pitt played Lieutenant Aldo Raine, an American resistance fighter battling Nazis in German-occupied France. The film was a box office hit, taking $311 million worldwide, and garnered generally favorable reviews. The film received multiple awards and nominations, including eight Academy Award nominations and seven MTV Movie Award nominations, including Best Male Performance for Pitt. He next voiced the superhero character Metro Man in the 2010 animated feature &quot;Megamind&quot;. Pitt produced and appeared in Terrence Malick&#x27;s experimental drama &quot;The Tree of Life&quot;, co-starring Sean Penn, which won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. In a performance that attracted strong praise, he portrayed the Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane in the drama &quot;Moneyball&quot;, which is based on the 2003 written by Michael Lewis. &quot;Moneyball&quot; received six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and Best Actor for Pitt.

His next role was as mob hitman Jackie Cogan in Andrew Dominik&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Killing Them Softly&quot;, based on the novel &quot;Cogan&#x27;s Trade&quot; by George V. Higgins. In 2013, Pitt starred in &quot;World War Z&quot;, a thriller about a zombie apocalypse, based on Max Brooks&#x27;s novel of the same name. Pitt also produced the film. &quot;World War Z&quot; grossed $540 million at the box office worldwide, becoming Pitt&#x27;s highest grossing picture. Next in 2013, he produced, and played a small role in, &quot;12 Years a Slave&quot;, a historical drama based on the autobiography of Solomon Northup. The film received critical acclaim and was nominated for nine Academy Awards, winning three, including Best Picture. Also in 2013, Pitt had a supporting role in Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Counselor&quot;. Plan B Entertainment landed its first television series on the 2013–2014 schedule, as their joint venture with ABC Studios, the sci-fi/fantasy drama &quot;Resurrection&quot;, was picked up by ABC.

Pitt starred in &quot;Fury&quot;, a World War II film directed and written by David Ayer, and co-starring Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Jon Bernthal, Michael Peña, and Jason Isaacs. The film was released on October 17, 2014. By the end of its run, &quot;Fury&quot; proved to be a commercial and critical success; it grossed more than $211 million worldwide and received highly positive reviews from critics. In 2015, Pitt starred opposite his wife, Jolie, in her third directorial effort, &quot;By the Sea&quot;, a romantic drama about a marriage in crisis, based on her screenplay. The film was their first collaboration since 2005&#x27;s &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot;. Pitt&#x27;s next role came with the biographical comedy-drama &quot;The Big Short&quot;, which he also produced and also co-starred alongside Christian Bale, Steve Carell, and Ryan Gosling. The film was a commercial and critical success. It went on to gross over $102 million worldwide and received positive reviews from critics. The film was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, earning Pitt his third Academy Award nomination as producer. In 2016, Pitt starred in Robert Zemeckis&#x27;s romantic thriller &quot;Allied&quot;, in which he plays an assassin who falls in love with a French spy (played by Marion Cotillard) during a mission to kill a German official in World War II. In 2017, he starred in the Netflix satirical war comedy &quot;War Machine&quot;, which he also produced. Pitt played a recurring role as a weatherman on the late-night talk show &quot;The Jim Jefferies Show&quot; throughout 2017.

A 2017 sequel to &quot;World War Z&quot; was in announced in 2016, before the film was briefly delayed, then confirmed to be directed by David Fincher, and then ultimately shelved due to budget issues. Pitt starred as Cliff Booth, a stunt double, opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 2019 film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;, reuniting with DiCaprio after &quot;The Departed&quot;, which Pitt produced and DiCaprio starred in. For his performance in the film, he received awards for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, BAFTA Awards, Screen Actors Guild Awards, and Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Awards. This is the second Academy Award for Brad Pitt, his first that he received for acting. In 2019, he also starred in James Gray&#x27;s deep space epic &quot;Ad Astra&quot;, in which he played Roy McBride, a space engineer searching the galaxy for his father. Pitt&#x27;s performance was praised as one of his career-best turn, delivering a performance &quot;that weaponizes passivity into a lethal form of self-defense&quot;. In 2020, Pitt portrayed Dr. Anthony Fauci in the cold open on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, earning him a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series nomination.

In 2021, Pitt entered the recording business by creating a company with French record producer Damien Quintard. Set in Pitt&#x27;s Chateau Miraval in South of France, Miraval Studios will re-open in 2022 after two decades of inactivity. The previous version of the studio was one of the most iconic studios in the world, producing the records for Pink Floyd, the Cranberries, AC/DC, Sade and Muse, among others. In 2022, Pitt starred in &quot;Bullet Train&quot;, directed by David Leitch, and reunited with his &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot; co-star Margot Robbie in &quot;Babylon&quot;, directed by Damien Chazelle. On January 5, 2022, he signed on to star in and produce a racing film on Formula One titled &quot;F1&quot;, directed by Joseph Kosinski, for which he will earn $30 million.

==Philanthropy and activism==
Pitt visited the University of Missouri campus in October 2004 to encourage students to vote in the 2004 U.S. presidential election, in which he supported John Kerry. Later in October, he publicly supported the principle of public funding for embryonic stem-cell research. &quot;We have to make sure that we open up these avenues so that our best and our brightest can go find these cures that they believe they will find&quot;, he said. In support of this he endorsed Proposition 71, a California ballot initiative intended to provide state government funding for stem-cell research.

Pitt supports One Campaign, an organization aimed at combating AIDS and poverty in the developing world. He narrated the 2005 PBS public television series &quot;Rx for Survival: A Global Health Challenge&quot;, which discusses current global health issues. The following year Pitt and Jolie flew to Haiti, where they visited a school supported by Yéle Haïti, a charity founded by Haitian-born hip hop musician Wyclef Jean. In May 2007, Pitt and Jolie donated $1 million to three organizations in Chad and Sudan dedicated to those affected by the crisis in the Darfur region. Along with Clooney, Damon, Don Cheadle, David Pressman, and Jerry Weintraub, Pitt is one of the founders of Not On Our Watch, an organization that focuses global attention on stopping &quot;mass atrocities&quot;.

Pitt has a sustained interest in architecture, even taking time away from film to study computer-aided design at the Los Angeles offices of renowned architect Frank Gehry. He narrated &quot;e2 design&quot;, a PBS television series focused on worldwide efforts to build environmentally friendly structures through sustainable architecture and design. In 2000, he co-authored an architectural book on the Blacker House with the architects Thomas A. Heinz and Randell Makinson. In 2006, he founded the Make It Right Foundation, organizing housing professionals in New Orleans to finance and construct 150 sustainable, affordable new houses in New Orleans&#x27;s Ninth Ward following the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina.

The project involves 13 architectural firms and the environmental organization Global Green USA, with several of the firms donating their services. Pitt and philanthropist Steve Bing have each committed $5 million in donations. The first six homes were completed in October 2008, and in September 2009 Pitt received an award in recognition of the project from the U.S. Green Building Council, a non-profit trade organization that promotes sustainability in how buildings are designed, built and operated. Pitt met with U.S. President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi in March 2009 to promote his concept of &quot;green housing&quot; as a national model and to discuss federal funding possibilities.

In September 2006, Pitt and Jolie established a charitable organization, the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, to aid humanitarian causes around the world. The foundation made initial donations of $1 million each to Global Action for Children and Doctors Without Borders, followed by an October 2006 donation of $100,000 to the Daniel Pearl Foundation, an organization created in memory of the late American journalist Daniel Pearl. According to federal filings, Pitt and Jolie invested $8.5 million into the foundation in 2006; it gave away $2.4 million in 2006 and $3.4 million in 2007. In June 2009, the Jolie-Pitt Foundation donated $1 million to a U.N. refugee agency to help Pakistanis displaced by fighting between troops and Taliban militants. In January 2010, the foundation donated $1 million to Doctors Without Borders for emergency medical assistance to help victims of the Haiti earthquake.

Pitt is a supporter of same-sex marriage. In an October 2006 interview with &quot;Esquire&quot;, Pitt said that he would marry Jolie when everyone in America is legally able to marry. In September 2008, he donated $100,000 to the campaign against California&#x27;s 2008 ballot proposition Proposition 8, an initiative to overturn the state Supreme Court decision that had legalized same-sex marriage. In March 2012, Pitt was featured in a performance of Dustin Lance Black&#x27;s play, &quot;8&quot; – a staged reenactment of the federal trial that overturned California&#x27;s Prop 8 ban on same-sex marriage – as Judge Vaughn Walker. In September 2012, Pitt reaffirmed his support for Obama, saying, &quot;I am an Obama supporter and I&#x27;m backing his U.S. election campaign.&quot; In October 2020, he narrated an advertisement for Joe Biden&#x27;s 2020 presidential campaign.

==Personal life==

===Relationships and marriages===
From the late 1980s to early 1990s, Pitt was romantically involved with several of his co-stars, including Shalane McCall (&quot;Dallas&quot;), Robin Givens (&quot;Head of the Class&quot;), Jill Schoelen (&quot;Cutting Class&quot;), Geena Davis (&quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot;), and Juliette Lewis (&quot;Too Young to Die?&quot; and &quot;Kalifornia&quot;). McCall and Lewis were respectively 15 and 16 when Pitt started dating them. Subsequently, Pitt had a much-publicized romance and engagement to his &quot;Seven&quot; co-star, Gwyneth Paltrow, whom he dated from 1994 to 1997.

Pitt met actress Jennifer Aniston in 1998; they married in a private wedding ceremony in Malibu on July 29, 2000. In January 2005, Pitt and Aniston announced they had decided to separate. Two months later, Aniston filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. Pitt and Aniston&#x27;s divorce was finalized by the Los Angeles Superior Court on October 2, 2005. Despite media reports that Pitt and Aniston had an acrimonious relationship, Pitt said in a February 2009 interview that he and Aniston &quot;check in with each other&quot;, adding that they were both big parts of each other&#x27;s lives.

During Pitt&#x27;s divorce proceedings, his involvement with his &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot; co-star Angelina Jolie attracted media attention. Jolie and Pitt stated that they fell in love on the set and that there was no infidelity. In April 2005, one month after Aniston filed for divorce, a set of paparazzi photographs emerged showing Pitt, Jolie, and her son Maddox at a beach in Kenya; the press interpreted the pictures as evidence of a relationship between Pitt and Jolie. Throughout 2005, the two were seen together with increasing frequency, and the entertainment media dubbed the couple &quot;Brangelina&quot;. On January 11, 2006, Jolie confirmed to &quot;People&quot; that she was pregnant with Pitt&#x27;s child, thereby publicly acknowledging their relationship for the first time. Pitt and Jolie announced their engagement in April 2012 after seven years together. They were legally married on August 14, 2014, and had their wedding in a private ceremony at the Château Miraval, France on August 23, 2014. On September 19, 2016, Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt, citing irreconcilable differences. On April 12, 2019, the divorce became legal. After Pitt sued Jolie for selling her share of a winery they owned to a third party, she filed a countersuit, in which she alleged that he physically and verbally abused her and their children during a plane flight in 2016.

In 2022, he began dating Ines de Ramon (b. 1992), a jewelry designer.

===Children===

In July 2005, Pitt accompanied Jolie to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where she adopted her second child, a girl named Zahara. On December 3, 2005, Pitt was in the process of becoming the adoptive father of Jolie&#x27;s daughter, and Jolie&#x27;s first adopted child, a boy named Maddox. On January 19, 2006, a California judge granted Jolie&#x27;s request to change the children&#x27;s surnames from &quot;Jolie&quot; to &quot;Jolie-Pitt&quot;. The adoptions were finalized soon after.

Jolie gave birth to their daughter Shiloh in Swakopmund, Namibia, on May 27, 2006. Pitt confirmed that she would qualify for a Namibian passport. The couple sold the first pictures of their daughter through the distributor Getty Images; the North American rights were purchased by &quot;People&quot; for over $4.1 million, while &quot;Hello!&quot; obtained the British rights for approximately $3.5 million. The proceeds from the sale were donated to charities serving African children. Madame Tussauds in New York unveiled a wax figure of the two-month-old; it marked the first time an infant had been honoured with a statue in the museum.

On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted a 3-year-old boy, Pax, from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Pitt adopted the boy in the United States on February 21, 2008. At the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins. She gave birth to son and daughter, Knox and Vivienne, on July 12, 2008 in Nice, France. The rights for the first images of the twins were jointly sold to &quot;People&quot; and &quot;Hello!&quot; for $14 million—the most expensive celebrity pictures ever taken. The couple donated the proceeds to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.

Since Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt on September 19, 2016, they have been embroiled in a custody battle over their children. Jolie had full custody until May 2021 when Pitt was granted joint custody, over four and a half years after proceedings began. However, in July, Los Angeles superior court judge John W. Ouderkirk was removed from the case due to concerns over his impartiality as he did not sufficiently disclose business relationships with Pitt&#x27;s lawyers. This resulted in the custody arrangement reverting to a previous November 2018 agreement where Jolie has primary physical custody while Pitt has &quot;custodial time&quot; with their minor children.

===Abuse allegation===

In September 2016, the FBI and the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services investigated Pitt for child abuse following an incident on a plane, where Pitt was accused by an anonymous person of being &quot;verbally abusive&quot; and &quot;physical&quot; towards one of his children. Pitt was not criminally charged for the incident by the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services, or by the FBI.

In 2022, Jolie filed a countersuit against Pitt during a legal battle over their formerly co-owned vineyard. Jolie&#x27;s lawyers stated that during negotiations, Pitt had asked Jolie to sign &quot;a nondisclosure agreement prohibiting her from speaking outside of court about his abuse of her and their children.&quot; Her complaint stated that he grabbed and shook her during the plane ride, strangled one of their children, and struck another in the face, among other allegations.

===Alcohol and drug use===
In September 2016, Pitt got sober and began attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In December 2019, he wrote an article for &quot;Interview&quot; in which he talked with his &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; and &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; costar and fellow recovering alcoholic Anthony Hopkins about their experiences with addiction and recovery. Pitt credits fellow actor Bradley Cooper with helping him in his sobriety.

Pitt has admitted to using cannabis in the late 1990s as a way to deal with his increasing fame. According to Pitt: &quot;I was hiding out from the celebrity thing; I was smoking way too much dope; I was sitting on the couch and just turning into a doughnut.&quot; He reduced his cannabis use and focused on his work after a trip to Morocco, where he witnessed extreme poverty and suffering.

=== Prosopagnosia ===
In 2022, Pitt said that he had struggled for years to recognize people&#x27;s faces due to prosopagnosia (face blindness). In a 2013 interview, he said that his inability to recognize people&#x27;s faces had become so severe that he often wanted to stay home. Formally, however, Pitt has not been diagnosed with prosopagnosia.

===Artworks===
Pitt has an interest in art, learned pottery, and has created sculptures. Nine of his sculptures were exhibited together with works by musician Nick Cave and artist Thomas Houseago at the Sara Hildén Art Museum in Tampere, Finland in 2022–2023.

==Public image==
Pitt has been frequently cited as one of the most attractive actors of all time and has been described as a sex symbol by many sources, including &quot;Empire&quot;, who named him one of the 25 sexiest stars in film history in 1995. The same year, he was named &quot;People&quot;″s Sexiest Man Alive, an accolade he received again in 2000. Pitt appeared on &quot;Forbes&quot;″ annual Celebrity 100 list of the 100 most powerful celebrities from 2006 to 2008 placing at numbers 20, 5 and 10, respectively. In 2007, he appeared on the &quot;Time&quot; 100 list, a compilation of the 100 most influential people in the world, as selected annually by &quot;Time&quot; magazine. The magazine credited Pitt for using &quot;his star power to get people to look [to where] cameras don&#x27;t usually catch&quot;. He was again included on the &quot;Time&quot; 100 in 2009, this time in the &quot;Builders and Titans&quot; list. , Pitt&#x27;s films have grossed over $6.9billion worldwide, according to the &quot;The Numbers&quot;.

Beginning in 2005, Pitt&#x27;s relationship with Angelina Jolie became one of the world&#x27;s most reported celebrity stories. After Jolie was confirmed to be pregnant in early 2006, the intense media hype surrounding the couple reached what Reuters, in a story titled &quot;The Brangelina fever,&quot; called &quot;the point of insanity&quot;. To avoid media attention, the couple flew to Namibia for the birth of their daughter, which was described by a paparazzi blog as &quot;the most anticipated baby since Jesus Christ.&quot; Similarly, intense media interest greeted the announcement of Jolie&#x27;s second pregnancy two years later; for the two weeks Jolie spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade to report on the birth.

In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Pitt, together with Jolie, were found to be the favorite celebrity endorsers for brands and products worldwide. Pitt has appeared in several television commercials. For the U.S. market, he starred in a Heineken commercial aired during the 2005 Super Bowl; it was directed by David Fincher, who had directed Pitt in &quot;Seven&quot;, &quot;Fight Club&quot;, and &quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&quot;. Other commercial appearances came in television spots including Acura Integra, in which he was featured opposite Russian model Tatiana Sorokko, as well as SoftBank, and Edwin Jeans. On June 2, 2015, the minor planet 29132 Bradpitt was named in his honor.

<text>Kidinnu (also &quot;Kidunnu&quot;; possibly fl. 4th century BC; possibly died 14 August 330 BC) was a Chaldean astronomer and mathematician. Strabo of Amaseia called him Kidenas, Pliny the Elder called him Cidenas, and Vettius Valens called him Kidynas.

Some cuneiform and classical Greek and Latin texts mention an astronomer with this name, but it is not clear if they all refer to the same individual:

* The Greek geographer Strabo of Amaseia, in &quot;Geography&quot; 16.1.6, writes: &quot;In Babylon a settlement is set apart for the local philosophers, the Chaldeans, as they are called, who are concerned mostly with astronomy; but some of these, who are not approved of by the others, profess to be writers of horoscopes. (There is also a tribe of the Chaldeans, and a territory inhabited by them, in the neighborhood of the Arabs and of the Persian Gulf, as it is called.) There are also several tribes of the Chaldean astronomers. For example, some are called Orcheni [those from Uruk], others Borsippeni [those from Borsippa], and several others by different names, as though divided into different sects which hold to various dogmas about the same subjects. And the mathematicians make mention of some of these men; as, for example, Kidenas, Nabourianos and Soudines&quot;.
* The Roman encyclopedist Pliny the Elder, in &quot;Natural History&quot; II.vi.39, writes that the planet Mercury can be viewed &quot;sometimes before sunrise and sometimes after sunset, but according to Cidenas and Sosigenes never more than 22 degrees away from the sun&quot;.
* The Roman astrologer Vettius Valens, in &quot;Anthology&quot;, says that he used Hipparchus for the Sun, Sudines and Kidynas and Apollonius for the Moon, and again Apollonius for both types (of eclipses, &quot;i.e.&quot; solar and lunar).
* The Hellenistic astronomer Ptolemy, in &quot;Almagest&quot; IV 2, discusses the duration and ratios of several periods related to the Moon, as known to &quot;ancient astronomers&quot; and &quot;the Chaldeans&quot; and improved by Hipparchus. He mentions (at H272) the equality of 251 (synodic) months to 269 returns in anomaly. In a preserved classical manuscript of the excerpt known as &quot;Handy Tables&quot;, an anonymous reader in the third century wrote the comment (a scholium) that Kidenas discovered this relation.
* The colophon of two Babylonian System B lunar ephemerides from Babylon (see ACT 122 for 104–101 BC, and ACT 123a for an unknown year) say that they are the &quot;tersitu&quot; (see below) of Kidinnu.
* A damaged cuneiform astronomical diary tablet from Babylon (Babylonian Chronicle 8: the Alexander Chronicle, BM 36304) mentions that &quot;ki-di-nu was killed by the sword&quot; on day 15 of probably the 5th month of that year, which has been dated as 14 August 330 BC, less than a year after Alexander the Great conquered Babylon.

The following information is an excerpt of the overview of a century of scholarship in the sources referenced below.

The meaning of &quot;tersitu&quot; is not known definitively. Already Franz Xaver Kugler proposed that the word can be interpreted here as &quot;table&quot;; in another context it seems to mean something like &quot;tool&quot;, but in yet another it refers to a blue enamel paste. P. Schnabel, in a series of papers (1923–1927), interpreted the phrase as an assignment of authorship. He argued that Naburimannu developed the Babylonian System A of calculating Solar System ephemerides, and that later Kidinnu developed the Babylonian System B. A Greco-Roman tradition, mentioned above, attributes to Kidinnu the discovery that 251 synodic months equals 269 anomalistic months. This relationship is implicit in System B, and is therefore another reason to believe that Kidinnu was involved in developing the lunar theory of System B. However, the conclusion that Kidinnu is the main creator of System B is uncertain. Babylonian astronomers before Kidinnu&#x27;s time apparently already knew the Saros cycle (old eclipse observations were collected in tables organised according to the Saros cycle since the late 5th century BC) and the Metonic cycle (the dates of the lunar calendar in the Saros tables follow a regular 19-year pattern of embolismic months at least since 498 BC); both cycles are also used in System B. Schnabel computed specific years (first 314 BC and later 379 BC) for the origin of the System B lunar theory, but Franz Xaver Kugler and Otto E. Neugebauer later disproved Schnabel&#x27;s calculations. Schnabel also asserted that Kidinnu discovered precession when distinguishing between sidereal and tropical years; Neugebauer contested this and current scholarship considers this conclusion to be unfounded.

The lunation length used in System B has also been attributed to Kidinnu. It is 29 days + 191 time degrees + 1/72 of a time degree (&quot;barley corn&quot;) = 29d 31:50:8:20 (sexagesimal) = 29d + 12h + 793/1080h (Hebrew &quot;helek&quot;) = 29.53059414...d. Being a rounded value in the archaic unit of &quot;barley corns&quot; it may be even more ancient. In any case, it is very accurate, within about ⅓ of a second per month. Hipparchus confirmed this value for the lunation length. Ptolemy accepted and used it, as mentioned above. Hillel II first used it in the Hebrew calendar, and it has been used for that purpose ever since.

The existing evidence makes it difficult to put Kidinnu at a time and place. Schnabel placed Kidinnu in Sippar, but Otto E. Neugebauer showed that Schnabel based this conclusion on a misreading of the cuneiform tablet. Classical sources like Strabo mention different &quot;schools&quot; and &quot;doctrines&quot; followed in different places (Babylon, Borsippa, Sippar, Uruk). System A and B have been used contemporaneously, and tablets for both systems have been found in both Babylon and Uruk. Tablets based on System B, associated with Kidinnu, have been found mostly in Uruk, but the earlier tablets came predominantly from Babylon. The oldest preserved tablet using System B comes from Babylon and dates from 258 to 257 BC. This is in the Seleucid era, but it is plausible that the traditional Chaldean astronomical systems had been developed before the Hellenistic period. The Alexander chronicle mentioned above suggests that the famous astronomer Kidinnu died in Babylon in 330 BC, &quot;if&quot; it refers to the same Kidinnu who was mentioned on the ephemeris tablets centuries later.

<text>Radical Party may refer to any of a number of political parties professing the progressive-liberal ideology known as Radicalism:

==Worldwide==
*Nonviolent Radical Party Transnational and Transparty (1989–present)

==Europe==
In the western Mediterranean European countries, Radicalism was one of the major political movements between 1848 and 1940. Such parties were often labelled &#x27;Democratic&#x27;, &#x27;Radical democratic&#x27;, or &#x27;Radical liberal&#x27; parties:

* In France:
**Radical Left (1902–1940), parliamentary group of the Independent Radicals.
**Radical-Socialist Party (France) (1901–present)
**Radical Party of the Left (1971–present)
**Radical Movement (2017–2021), former merger of the Radical Party and the Radical Party of the Left.
* In Italy:
**Italian Radical Party (1877–1925)
**Radical Party (Italy) (1955–1989)
**Italian Radicals (2001–present)
**Radical Socialist Movement (2006-present), formed by dissidents members of the Radicals of the Left
**Liberty and Equality (2010-present), formed by dissidents members of the Radicals of the Left
* In Spain, Radicalism took the form of various parties labelled &#x27;democratic&#x27;, &#x27;progressive&#x27;, &#x27;radical&#x27; and &#x27;republican&#x27;:
** the Progressive Party (1835–69), formed by former participants in the radical Revolution of 1820;
** the Democratic Party (1849–69) a Spanish progressive party of Jacobin and 1848er inspiration, active in the 1850s.
** the Federal Democratic Republican Party (1868–1910)
** the Democratic Radical Party (1869–80), successor the Progressive Party. It was refounded in 1880, following splinters, as the Progressive Democratic Party (1880–1912)
** the successor Democratic Party (1876–9) reformed as the Possibilist Democratic Party (1879–90)
** The Radical-Republican Party (1908–40), a splinter of the Progressive Democratic Party;
** Its splinter, the Radical-Socialist Republican Party (1928–34). This merged with others to form the Republican Left (1934–59)
** A second splinter of the Radical-Republican Party formed the Republican Democratic Party and Republican Union (1934–59)

In the Dutch-speaking, German-speaking and Nordic countries, the English or French term Radical was represented by terms that literally translated as &#x27;Free-Minded&#x27; (or, alternatively, as &#x27;Freethinker&#x27; or &#x27;Rationalist&#x27;), including:

* In Switzerland:
** the original Radical Party (1830s–1894), see Regeneration (Switzerland)
** the comparatively left-leaning successor party known as the Radical-Democratic Party (in French) and the &quot;Free-minded Democratic Party&quot; (German) (1878 to present)
** the comparatively right-leaning successor party known as the Radical-Liberal Party (1893 to 2009), and its successor the FDP, whose name translates to the &quot;Free-minded and Liberal Party&quot; in German and the &quot;Radical and Liberal Party&quot; in French (2009–present)
* In Luxembourg: 
** the Liberal League (1904–28), although predominantly classical liberal rather than Radical, contained a left-wing faction of Radical ideology;
** the Radical Socialist Party (1925–1932), founded by the splinter of the left-wing of the old Liberal League;
** the Radical Party (Luxembourg) (1928–1932), founded by the splinter of the right-wing of the Radical Socialist Party.
**the Radical Liberal Party (Luxembourg) (1932–1945), formed as a merger of the Radical Socialist Party and Radical Party
* In the Netherlands:
** the Radical League (1892–1901)
** the Free-minded Democratic League (1901-1946)
**the Political Party of Radicals (1968–1991)
* In Germany, a succession of Radical parties existed:
** The German Free-minded Party (1884 to 1893), which split into two successors:
** the left-leaning Free-minded Union (1893 to 1910)
** and the centre-leaning the Free-minded People&#x27;s Party (1893 to 1910)
** These merged as the Progressive People&#x27;s Party (1910 to 1918)
** This was reformed as the German Democratic Party (1918 to 1930).
* In Scandinavia:
** In Denmark, the current Liberal Party began as a Radical Party, hence its name in Danish (Venstre, &#x27;Left&#x27;). The Radical wing split off from the classical-liberal majority in 1905 to form a new party, known as Radikale Venstre (Radical Left).
** In Sweden, the Free-minded National Association (1902 to 1934)
** In Norway, the Free-minded Liberal Party (1909 to 1932) and Free-minded People&#x27;s Party (1932 to 1935)
** In Finland, the Young Finns (1905-1918), its successor the National Progressive Party (1919–51), and its successor the Free-minded League (1951 to 1965)

In south-eastern Europe, Radicalism was also a historically important political movement:

* In Bulgaria, the Radical Democratic Party (1902–present)
* In Greece
** the Party of Radicals (1848-1864) of the United States of the Ionian Islands
** the Venizelist splinter from the Liberal Party () and the Democratic Party ()

** the Independent Radical Party (1903-1919), left-wing splinter of the former
** the State Party of Serbian, Croatian and Slovene Democrats (1919-1946) and its splinter, the Republican and Democratic Party (1924-1946)
** the Serbian Radical Party (1991–present)
* In Turkey, the Republican People&#x27;s Party (1919-1980)

<text>The 1090s BC is a decade which lasted from 1099 BC to 1090 BC.
==Events and trends==
* 1090 BC—or the Year of the Hyenas, in the reign of Ramesses XI, was a year of catastrophe. There was a very significant drop in the flow of river Nile waters, caused by a spike in climate normality. This led to significant starvation of the Egyptians, loss of faith in the religion as conducted by the high priest and collapse not only of the state in Egypt but also its economy, leading to a ten-year period of chaos. This led to the emergence of tomb robbers and the end of the Valley of the Kings as a burial site.

<text>The 1170s BC is a decade which lasted from 1179 BC to 1170 BC.

==Events and trends==
* Late Bronze Age collapse when between 1206 and 1150 BC, the cultural collapse of the Mycenaean kingdoms, the Hittite Empire in Anatolia and Syria, and the New Kingdom of Egypt in Syria and Canaan interrupted trade routes and severely reduced literacy. In Greece the Late Bronze Age polities were replaced, after a hiatus, by the isolated village cultures of the Greek Dark Ages (ca. 1100–800 BC).
*1180–1178 BC—Collapse of the Hittite Empire. Their capital, Hattusa, falls around or slightly after 1180 BC.
* 1178 BC, April 16—A solar eclipse occurs. This may have marked the return of Odysseus, legendary King of Ithaca, to his kingdom after the Trojan War. He discovers a number of suitors competing to marry his wife Penelope, whom they believe to be a widow, in order to succeed him on the throne. He organizes their slaying and re-establishes himself on the throne. The date is surmised from a passage in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, which reads, &quot;The Sun has been obliterated from the sky, and an unlucky darkness invades the world.&quot; This happens in the context of a new moon, a necessary precondition for a full solar eclipse, and at noon, the computed time of the solar eclipse of April 16, 1178 BC. In 2008, to investigate, Dr Marcelo O. Magnasco, an astronomer at Rockefeller University, and Constantino Baikouzis, of the Observatorio Astrónomico de La Plata in Argentina, looked for more clues. Within the text, they interpreted three definitive astronomical events: there was a new moon on the day of the slaughter (as required for a solar eclipse); Venus was visible and high in the sky six days before; and the constellations Pleiades and Boötes were both visible at sunset 29 days before. Since these events recur at different intervals, this particular sequence only occurs once in 2000 years. The researchers found only one occurrence of this sequence between 1250 and 1115 BC, the 135-year spread around the putative date for the fall of Troy. It happened to coincide with the eclipse of April 16, 1178 BC.
*Battle of the Delta, circa 1175 BC, when the Egyptian pharaoh Ramesses III repulsed a major sea invasion by the Sea Peoples.

==Significant people==
*Odysseus of Troy&#x27;s 10-year trip home was through the 1170s

<text>An engine department or engineering department is an organizational unit aboard a ship that is responsible for the operation, maintenance, and repair of the propulsion systems and the support systems for crew, passengers, and cargo. 
These include the ship engine, fuel oil, lubrication, water distillation, separation process, lighting, air conditioning, and refrigeration.

The engine department emerged with the arrival of marine engines for propulsion, largely during the later half of the 19th century. Due to advances in marine technology during the 20th century, the engine department aboard merchant ships is considered equally important as the deck department, since trained engine officers are required to handle the machinery on a ship.

The engine department takes care of the engine room aboard a ship. Rotations vary depending on the vessel or company. Whoever is on a rotation has to stand watch to look over the engine and its components. There are different crew members for watch rotation.
Typically, a ship&#x27;s engine department is run by the engine officers but staffed with other occupational specialties of the seafarer&#x27;s trade like:
*Machinist/Fitter: A rating (or petty officer) who is specialized in fabrication, welding, etc.
*Motorman: A, not always, qualified engine rating who stands a watch with the engine officer, as well as performing routine tasks and assisting engine officers during maintenance.
*Oiler: A rating who is responsible for ensuring that machinery is adequately lubricated. Performs menial tasks such as cleaning, sounding tanks etc.
*Wiper: The lowest rating in the engine room and is tasked with keeping the machinery spaces clean and tidy. Wipers usually go on to become oilers once they are familiar with engine room machinery and specific routines.

In order to be a watch officer and have the license for it, there are 3 basic requirements and they are age, seagoing service, and education/training on stcw&#x27;s. Some basic USCG stcw requirements go further into seagoing service, approved trainings such as; engine resource management, gas/steam turbine plants, control systems, etc., and finally the competencies which include &quot;Evidence of Standard of competence&quot;.

Defunct positions within the engine department include the fireman, who was a rating responsible for shoveling coal into the boiler furnaces of steam engines, and the coal trimmer, a rating that loaded coal in the bunkers and transported the coal from the bunkers to the firemen.

Nowadays due to the increase in automation on merchant vessels and the increase in the unattended machinery spaces (UMS) aboard them, the number of seafaring engine officers has decreased drastically on board merchant ships. Today, the engine department usually consists of the following number of engine officers and ratings:

* (1) Chief engineer
* (1) Second engineer
* (1) Third engineer
* (1-2) Fourth engineer
* (0-1) Engine Cadet
* (2-4) Motorman 
* (0-2) Oiler
* (0-1) Wiper

Additionally, many vessels also carry a specific type of engine officer known as an electro-technical officer.

<doc id="44883" wikidata="Q131172" url="?curid=44883" title="Welding">
<text>Welding is a fabrication process that joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, primarily by using high temperature to melt the parts together and allow them to cool, causing fusion. Common alternative methods include solvent welding (of thermoplastics) using chemicals to melt materials being bonded without heat, and solid-state welding processes which bond without melting, such as pressure, cold welding, and diffusion bonding.

Metal welding is distinct from lower temperature bonding techniques such as brazing and soldering, which do not melt the base metal (parent metal) and instead require flowing a filler metal to solidify their bonds.

In addition to melting the base metal in welding, a filler material is typically added to the joint to form a pool of molten material (the weld pool) that cools to form a joint that can be stronger than the base material. Welding also requires a form of shield to protect the filler metals or melted metals from being contaminated or oxidized.

Many different energy sources can be used for welding, including a gas flame (chemical), an electric arc (electrical), a laser, an electron beam, friction, and ultrasound. While often an industrial process, welding may be performed in many different environments, including in open air, under water, and in outer space. Welding is a hazardous undertaking and precautions are required to avoid burns, electric shock, vision damage, inhalation of poisonous gases and fumes, and exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation.

Until the end of the 19th century, the only welding process was forge welding, which blacksmiths had used for millennia to join iron and steel by heating and hammering. Arc welding and oxy-fuel welding were among the first processes to develop late in the century, and electric resistance welding followed soon after. Welding technology advanced quickly during the early 20th century, as world wars drove the demand for reliable and inexpensive joining methods. Following the wars, several modern welding techniques were developed, including manual methods like shielded metal arc welding, now one of the most popular welding methods, as well as semi-automatic and automatic processes such as gas metal arc welding, submerged arc welding, flux-cored arc welding and electroslag welding. Developments continued with the invention of laser beam welding, electron beam welding, magnetic pulse welding, and friction stir welding in the latter half of the century. Today, as the science continues to advance, robot welding is commonplace in industrial settings, and researchers continue to develop new welding methods and gain greater understanding of weld quality.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;weld&quot; is derived from the Middle English verb &quot;well&quot; (; plural/present tense: ) or &quot;welling&quot; (), meaning &#x27;to heat&#x27; (to the maximum temperature possible); &#x27;to bring to a boil&#x27;. The modern word was probably derived from the past-tense participle &quot;welled&quot; (), with the addition of &quot;d&quot; for this purpose being common in the Germanic languages of the Angles and Saxons. It was first recorded in English in 1590. A fourteenth century translation of the Christian Bible into English by John Wycliffe translates Isaiah 2:4 as &quot; (they shall beat together their swords into plowshares). In the 1590 version this was changed to &quot;&quot;&quot; (they shall weld together their swords into plowshares), suggesting this particular use of the word probably became popular in English sometime between these periods.

The Old English word for welding iron was (&#x27;to bring together&#x27;) or (&#x27;to bring together hot&#x27;).

The word is related to the Old Swedish word , meaning &#x27;to boil&#x27;, which could refer to joining metals, as in (literally &#x27;to boil iron&#x27;). Sweden was a large exporter of iron during the Middle Ages, so the word may have entered English from the Swedish iron trade, or may have been imported with the thousands of Viking settlements that arrived in England before and during the Viking Age, as more than half of the most common English words in everyday use are Scandinavian in origin.

==History==
The history of joining metals goes back several millennia. The earliest examples of this come from the Bronze and Iron Ages in Europe and the Middle East. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus states in &quot;The Histories&quot; of the 5th century BC that Glaucus of Chios &quot;was the man who single-handedly invented iron welding&quot;. Forge welding was used in the construction of the Iron pillar of Delhi, erected in Delhi, India about 310 AD and weighing 5.4 metric tons.

The Middle Ages brought advances in forge welding, in which blacksmiths pounded heated metal repeatedly until bonding occurred. In 1540, Vannoccio Biringuccio published &quot;De la pirotechnia&quot;, which includes descriptions of the forging operation. Renaissance craftsmen were skilled in the process, and the industry continued to grow during the following centuries.

In 1800, Sir Humphry Davy discovered the short-pulse electrical arc and presented his results in 1801. In 1802, Russian scientist Vasily Petrov created the continuous electric arc, and subsequently published &quot;News of Galvanic-Voltaic Experiments&quot; in 1803, in which he described experiments carried out in 1802. Of great importance in this work was the description of a stable arc discharge and the indication of its possible use for many applications, one being melting metals. In 1808, Davy, who was unaware of Petrov&#x27;s work, rediscovered the continuous electric arc. In 1881–82 inventors Nikolai Benardos (Russian) and Stanisław Olszewski (Polish) created the first electric arc welding method known as carbon arc welding using carbon electrodes. The advances in arc welding continued with the invention of metal electrodes in the late 1800s by a Russian, Nikolai Slavyanov (1888), and an American, C. L. Coffin (1890). Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger released a coated metal electrode in Britain, which gave a more stable arc. In 1905, Russian scientist Vladimir Mitkevich proposed using a three-phase electric arc for welding. Alternating current welding was invented by C. J. Holslag in 1919, but did not become popular for another decade.

Resistance welding was also developed during the final decades of the 19th century, with the first patents going to Elihu Thomson in 1885, who produced further advances over the next 15 years. Thermite welding was invented in 1893, and around that time another process, oxyfuel welding, became well established. Acetylene was discovered in 1836 by Edmund Davy, but its use was not practical in welding until about 1900, when a suitable torch was developed. At first, oxyfuel welding was one of the more popular welding methods due to its portability and relatively low cost. As the 20th century progressed, however, it fell out of favor for industrial applications. It was largely replaced with arc welding, as advances in metal coverings (known as flux) were made. Flux covering the electrode primarily shields the base material from impurities, but also stabilizes the arc and can add alloying components to the weld metal.
World War I caused a major surge in the use of welding, with the various military powers attempting to determine which of the several new welding processes would be best. The British primarily used arc welding, even constructing a ship, the &quot;Fullagar&quot; with an entirely welded hull. Arc welding was first applied to aircraft during the war as well, as some German airplane fuselages were constructed using the process. Also noteworthy is the first welded road bridge in the world, the Maurzyce Bridge in Poland (1928).

During the 1920s, significant advances were made in welding technology, including the introduction of automatic welding in 1920, in which electrode wire was fed continuously. Shielding gas became a subject receiving much attention, as scientists attempted to protect welds from the effects of oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere. Porosity and brittleness were the primary problems, and the solutions that developed included the use of hydrogen, argon, and helium as welding atmospheres. During the following decade, further advances allowed for the welding of reactive metals like aluminum and magnesium. This in conjunction with developments in automatic welding, alternating current, and fluxes fed a major expansion of arc welding during the 1930s and then during World War II. In 1930, the first all-welded merchant vessel, M/S &quot;Carolinian&quot;, was launched.
During the middle of the century, many new welding methods were invented. In 1930, Kyle Taylor was responsible for the release of stud welding, which soon became popular in shipbuilding and construction. Submerged arc welding was invented the same year and continues to be popular today. In 1932 a Russian, Konstantin Khrenov eventually implemented the first underwater electric arc welding. Gas tungsten arc welding, after decades of development, was finally perfected in 1941, and gas metal arc welding followed in 1948, allowing for fast welding of non-ferrous materials but requiring expensive shielding gases. Shielded metal arc welding was developed during the 1950s, using a flux-coated consumable electrode, and it quickly became the most popular metal arc welding process. In 1957, the flux-cored arc welding process debuted, in which the self-shielded wire electrode could be used with automatic equipment, resulting in greatly increased welding speeds, and that same year, plasma arc welding was invented by Robert Gage. Electroslag welding was introduced in 1958, and it was followed by its cousin, electrogas welding, in 1961. In 1953, the Soviet scientist N. F. Kazakov proposed the diffusion bonding method.

Other recent developments in welding include the 1958 breakthrough of electron beam welding, making deep and narrow welding possible through the concentrated heat source. Following the invention of the laser in 1960, laser beam welding debuted several decades later, and has proved to be especially useful in high-speed, automated welding. Magnetic pulse welding (MPW) has been industrially used since 1967. Friction stir welding was invented in 1991 by Wayne Thomas at The Welding Institute (TWI, UK) and found high-quality applications all over the world. All of these four new processes continue to be quite expensive due to the high cost of the necessary equipment, and this has limited their applications.

==Processes==
Welding joins two pieces of metal using heat, pressure, or both. The most common modern welding methods use heat sufficient to melt the base metals to be joined and the filler metal. This includes gas welding and all forms of arc welding. The area where the base and filler metals melt is called the weld pool or puddle. Most welding methods involve pushing the puddle along a joint to create a weld bead. Overlapping pieces of metal can be joined by forming the weld pool within a hole made in the topmost piece of base metal to form a plug weld. Overlapping base metals are commonly joined using electric resistance welding, a process that combines heat and pressure and does not require a filler metal. Solid-state welding processes join two pieces of metal using pressure.

===Gas welding===

The most common gas welding process is oxyfuel welding, also known as oxyacetylene welding. It is one of the oldest and most versatile welding processes, but in recent years it has become less popular in industrial applications. It is still widely used for welding pipes and tubes, as well as repair work.

The equipment is relatively inexpensive and simple, generally employing the combustion of acetylene in oxygen to produce a welding flame temperature of about 3100 °C (5600 °F). The flame, since it is less concentrated than an electric arc, causes slower weld cooling, which can lead to greater residual stresses and weld distortion, though it eases the welding of high alloy steels. A similar process, generally called oxyfuel cutting, is used to cut metals.

===Arc welding===

All arc welding processes use a welding power supply to create and maintain an electric arc between an electrode and the base material to melt metals at the welding point. They can use alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC). For DC welding, the electrode can be connected to the machine&#x27;s positive terminal (DCEP) or negative terminal (DCEN), changing the current&#x27;s direction. The process and type of electrode used will typically determine the current. 

Shielding gas prevents oxygen in the atmosphere from entering the molten weld pool. In some processes, the shielding gas is delivered from gas cylinders containing inert or semi-inert gas. In others, a flux coating on a consumable electrode disintegrates to create the gas. Filler material is typically added to the molten weld pool and is necessary for processes that use a consumable electrode.

====Arc welding processes====
One of the most common types of arc welding is shielded metal arc welding (SMAW); it is also known as manual metal arc welding (MMAW) or stick welding. Electric current is used to strike an arc between the base material and consumable electrode rod, which is made of filler material (typical steel) and is covered with a flux that protects the weld area from oxidation and contamination by producing carbon dioxide (CO2) gas during the welding process. The electrode core itself acts as filler material, making a separate filler unnecessary.

The process is versatile and can be performed with relatively inexpensive equipment, making it well suited to shop jobs and field work. An operator can become reasonably proficient with a modest amount of training and can achieve mastery with experience. Weld times are rather slow, since the consumable electrodes must be frequently replaced and because slag, the residue from the flux, must be chipped away after welding. Furthermore, the process is generally limited to welding ferrous materials, though special electrodes have made possible the welding of cast iron, stainless steel, aluminum, and other metals.

Gas metal arc welding (GMAW), also known as metal inert gas or MIG welding, is a semi-automatic or automatic process that uses a continuous wire feed as an electrode and an inert or semi-inert gas mixture to protect the weld from contamination. Since the electrode is continuous, welding speeds are greater for GMAW than for SMAW.

A related process, flux-cored arc welding (FCAW), uses similar equipment but uses wire consisting of a tubular steel electrode surrounding a powder fill material. This cored wire is more expensive than the standard solid wire and can generate fumes and/or slag, but it permits even higher welding speed and greater metal penetration. As the electrode is consumed, the flux disintegrates to create shielding gas and a protective layer of slag similar to stick welding. Some flux-cored machines have a nozzle that uses a shielding gas to supplement the protection from the flux. This is called dual shield welding, and used a specialized gas shielded flux-core wire.
Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), or tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding, is a manual welding process that uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode, an inert or semi-inert gas mixture, and a separate filler material. Especially useful for welding thin materials, this method is characterized by a stable arc and high-quality welds, but it requires significant operator skill and can only be accomplished at relatively low speeds.

GTAW can be used on nearly all weldable metals, though it is most often applied to stainless steel and light metals. It is often used when quality welds are extremely important, such as in bicycle, aircraft and naval applications. A related process, plasma arc welding, also uses a tungsten electrode but uses plasma gas to make the arc. The arc is more concentrated than the GTAW arc, making transverse control more critical and thus generally restricting the technique to a mechanized process. Because of its stable current, the method can be used on a wider range of material thicknesses than can the GTAW process and it is much faster. It can be applied to all of the same materials as GTAW except magnesium, and automated welding of stainless steel is one important application of the process. A variation of the process is plasma cutting, an efficient steel cutting process.

Submerged arc welding (SAW) is a high-productivity welding method in which the arc is struck beneath a covering layer of flux. This increases arc quality since contaminants in the atmosphere are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself, and combined with the use of a continuous wire feed, the weld deposition rate is high. Working conditions are much improved over other arc welding processes, since the flux hides the arc and almost no smoke is produced. The process is commonly used in industry, especially for large products and in the manufacture of welded pressure vessels. Other arc welding processes include atomic hydrogen welding, electroslag welding (ESW), electrogas welding, and stud arc welding. ESW is a highly productive, single-pass welding process for thicker materials between 1 inch (25 mm) and 12 inches (300 mm) in a vertical or close to vertical position.

====Arc welding power supplies====
To supply the electrical power necessary for arc welding processes, a variety of different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc is directly related to the voltage, and the amount of heat input is related to the current. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux-cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.

The type of current used plays an important role in arc welding. Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties. If the electrode is positively charged, the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds. Non-consumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds. Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossings, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.

===Resistance welding===
Resistance welding involves the generation of heat by passing current through the resistance caused by the contact between two or more metal surfaces. Small pools of molten metal are formed at the weld area as high current (1,000–100,000 A) is passed through the metal. In general, resistance welding methods are efficient and cause little pollution, but their applications are somewhat limited and the equipment cost can be high.
Resistance spot welding is a popular method used to join overlapping metal sheets of up to 3 mm thick. Two electrodes are simultaneously used to clamp the metal sheets together and to pass current through the sheets. The advantages of the method include efficient energy use, limited workpiece deformation, high production rates, easy automation, and no required filler materials. Weld strength is significantly lower than with other welding methods, making the process suitable for only certain applications. It is used extensively in the automotive industry—ordinary cars can have several thousand spot welds made by industrial robots. A specialized process called shot welding, can be used to spot weld stainless steel.

Seam welding also relies on two electrodes to apply pressure and current to join metal sheets. However, instead of pointed electrodes, wheel-shaped electrodes roll along and often feed the workpiece, making it possible to make long continuous welds. In the past, this process was used in the manufacture of beverage cans, but now its uses are more limited. Other resistance welding methods include butt welding, flash welding, projection welding, and upset welding.

===Energy beam welding===
Energy beam welding methods, namely laser beam welding and electron beam welding, are relatively new processes that have become quite popular in high production applications. The two processes are quite similar, differing most notably in their source of power. Laser beam welding employs a highly focused laser beam, while electron beam welding is done in a vacuum and uses an electron beam. Both have a very high energy density, making deep weld penetration possible and minimizing the size of the weld area. Both processes are extremely fast, and are easily automated, making them highly productive. The primary disadvantages are their very high equipment costs (though these are decreasing) and a susceptibility to thermal cracking. Developments in this area include laser-hybrid welding, which uses principles from both laser beam welding and arc welding for even better weld properties, laser cladding, and x-ray welding.

===Solid-state welding===
Like forge welding (the earliest welding process discovered), some modern welding methods do not involve the melting of the materials being joined. One of the most popular, ultrasonic welding, is used to connect thin sheets or wires made of metal or thermoplastic by vibrating them at high frequency and under high pressure. The equipment and methods involved are similar to that of resistance welding, but instead of electric current, vibration provides energy input. When welding metals, the vibrations are introduced horizontally, and the materials are not melted; with plastics, which should have similar melting temperatures, vertically. Ultrasonic welding is commonly used for making electrical connections out of aluminum or copper, and it is also a very common polymer welding process.

Another common process, explosion welding, involves the joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The energy from the impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though only a limited amount of heat is generated. The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar materials, including bonding aluminum to carbon steel in ship hulls and stainless steel or titanium to carbon steel in petrochemical pressure vessels.

Other solid-state welding processes include friction welding (including friction stir welding and friction stir spot welding), magnetic pulse welding, co-extrusion welding, cold welding, diffusion bonding, exothermic welding, high frequency welding, hot pressure welding, induction welding, and roll bonding.

==Geometry==

Welds can be geometrically prepared in many different ways. The five basic types of weld joints are the butt joint, lap joint, corner joint, edge joint, and T-joint (a variant of this last is the cruciform joint). Other variations exist as well—for example, double-V preparation joints are characterized by the two pieces of material each tapering to a single center point at one-half their height. Single-U and double-U preparation joints are also fairly common—instead of having straight edges like the single-V and double-V preparation joints, they are curved, forming the shape of a U. Lap joints are also commonly more than two pieces thick—depending on the process used and the thickness of the material, many pieces can be welded together in a lap joint geometry.

Many welding processes require the use of a particular joint design; for example, resistance spot welding, laser beam welding, and electron beam welding are most frequently performed on lap joints. Other welding methods, like shielded metal arc welding, are extremely versatile and can weld virtually any type of joint. Some processes can also be used to make multipass welds, in which one weld is allowed to cool, and then another weld is performed on top of it. This allows for the welding of thick sections arranged in a single-V preparation joint, for example.
After welding, a number of distinct regions can be identified in the weld area. The weld itself is called the fusion zone—more specifically, it is where the filler metal was laid during the welding process. The properties of the fusion zone depend primarily on the filler metal used, and its compatibility with the base materials. It is surrounded by the heat-affected zone, the area that had its microstructure and properties altered by the weld. These properties depend on the base material&#x27;s behavior when subjected to heat. The metal in this area is often weaker than both the base material and the fusion zone, and is also where residual stresses are found.

==Quality==

Many distinct factors influence the strength of welds and the material around them, including the welding method, the amount and concentration of energy input, the weldability of the base material, filler material, and flux material, the design of the joint, and the interactions between all these factors.

For example, the factor of welding position influences weld quality, that welding codes &amp; specifications may require testing—both welding procedures and welders—using specified welding positions: 1G (flat), 2G (horizontal), 3G (vertical), 4G (overhead), 5G (horizontal fixed pipe), or 6G (inclined fixed pipe).

To test the quality of a weld, either destructive or nondestructive testing methods are commonly used to verify that welds are free of defects, have acceptable levels of residual stresses and distortion, and have acceptable heat-affected zone (HAZ) properties. Types of welding defects include cracks, distortion, gas inclusions (porosity), non-metallic inclusions, lack of fusion, incomplete penetration, lamellar tearing, and undercutting.

The metalworking industry has instituted codes and specifications to guide welders, weld inspectors, engineers, managers, and property owners in proper welding technique, design of welds, how to judge the quality of welding procedure specification, how to judge the skill of the person performing the weld, and how to ensure the quality of a welding job. Methods such as visual inspection, radiography, ultrasonic testing, phased-array ultrasonics, dye penetrant inspection, magnetic particle inspection, or industrial computed tomography can help with detection and analysis of certain defects.

===Heat-affected zone===
The heat-affected zone (HAZ) is a ring surrounding the weld in which the temperature of the welding process, combined with the stresses of uneven heating and cooling, alters the heat-treatment properties of the alloy. The effects of welding on the material surrounding the weld can be detrimental—depending on the materials used and the heat input of the welding process used, the HAZ can be of varying size and strength. The thermal diffusivity of the base material plays a large role—if the diffusivity is high, the material cooling rate is high and the HAZ is relatively small. Conversely, a low diffusivity leads to slower cooling and a larger HAZ. The amount of heat injected by the welding process plays an important role as well, as processes like oxyacetylene welding have an unconcentrated heat input and increase the size of the HAZ. Processes like laser beam welding give a highly concentrated, limited amount of heat, resulting in a small HAZ. Arc welding falls between these two extremes, with the individual processes varying somewhat in heat input. To calculate the heat input for arc welding procedures, the following formula can be used:

:formula_1

where &quot;Q&quot; = heat input (kJ/mm), &quot;V&quot; = voltage (V), &quot;I&quot; = current (A), and &quot;S&quot; = welding speed (mm/min). The efficiency is dependent on the welding process used, with shielded metal arc welding having a value of 0.75, gas metal arc welding and submerged arc welding, 0.9, and gas tungsten arc welding, 0.8. Methods of alleviating the stresses and brittleness created in the HAZ include stress relieving and tempering.

One major defect concerning the HAZ is cracking at the junction of the weld face and the base metal. Due to the rapid expansion (heating) and contraction (cooling), the material may not have the ability to withstand the stress and could crack. One method to control the stress is to control the heating and cooling rate, such as pre-heating and post-heating 

===Lifetime extension with after treatment methods===

The durability and life of dynamically loaded, welded steel structures is determined in many cases by the welds, in particular the weld transitions. Through selective treatment of the transitions by grinding (abrasive cutting), shot peening, High-frequency impact treatment, Ultrasonic impact treatment, etc. the durability of many designs increases significantly.

==Metallurgy==

Most solids used are engineering materials consisting of crystalline solids in which the atoms or ions are arranged in a repetitive geometric pattern which is known as a lattice structure. The only exception is material that is made from glass which is a combination of a supercooled liquid and polymers which are aggregates of large organic molecules.

Crystalline solids cohesion is obtained by a metallic or chemical bond that is formed between the constituent atoms. Chemical bonds can be grouped into two types consisting of ionic and covalent. To form an ionic bond, either a valence or bonding electron separates from one atom and becomes attached to another atom to form oppositely charged ions. The bonding in the static position is when the ions occupy an equilibrium position where the resulting force between them is zero. When the ions are exerted in tension force, the inter-ionic spacing increases creating an electrostatic attractive force, while a repulsing force under compressive force between the atomic nuclei is dominant.

Covalent bonding takes place when one of the constituent atoms loses one or more electrons, with the other atom gaining the electrons, resulting in an electron cloud that is shared by the molecule as a whole. In both ionic and covalent bonding the location of the ions and electrons are constrained relative to each other, thereby resulting in the bond being characteristically brittle.

Metallic bonding can be classified as a type of covalent bonding for which the constituent atoms are of the same type and do not combine with one another to form a chemical bond. Atoms will lose an electron(s) forming an array of positive ions. These electrons are shared by the lattice which makes the electron cluster mobile, as the electrons are free to move as well as the ions. For this, it gives metals their relatively high thermal and electrical conductivity as well as being characteristically ductile.

Three of the most commonly used crystal lattice structures in metals are the body-centred cubic, face-centred cubic and close-packed hexagonal. Ferritic steel has a body-centred cubic structure and austenitic steel, non-ferrous metals like aluminium, copper and nickel have the face-centred cubic structure.

Ductility is an important factor in ensuring the integrity of structures by enabling them to sustain local stress concentrations without fracture. In addition, structures are required to be of an acceptable strength, which is related to a material&#x27;s yield strength. In general, as the yield strength of a material increases, there is a corresponding reduction in fracture toughness.

A reduction in fracture toughness may also be attributed to the embrittlement effect of impurities, or for body-centred cubic metals, from a reduction in temperature. Metals and in particular steels have a transitional temperature range where above this range the metal has acceptable notch-ductility while below this range the material becomes brittle. Within the range, the materials behavior is unpredictable. The reduction in fracture toughness is accompanied by a change in the fracture appearance. When above the transition, the fracture is primarily due to micro-void coalescence, which results in the fracture appearing fibrous. When the temperatures falls the fracture will show signs of cleavage facets. These two appearances are visible by the naked eye. Brittle fracture in steel plates may appear as chevron markings under the microscope. These arrow-like ridges on the crack surface point towards the origin of the fracture.

Fracture toughness is measured using a notched and pre-cracked rectangular specimen, of which the dimensions are specified in standards, for example ASTM E23. There are other means of estimating or measuring fracture toughness by the following: The Charpy impact test per ASTM A370; The crack-tip opening displacement (CTOD) test per BS 7448–1; The J integral test per ASTM E1820; The Pellini drop-weight test per ASTM E208.

==Unusual conditions==
While many welding applications are done in controlled environments such as factories and repair shops, some welding processes are commonly used in a wide variety of conditions, such as open air, underwater, and vacuums (such as space). In open-air applications, such as construction and outdoors repair, shielded metal arc welding is the most common process. Processes that employ inert gases to protect the weld cannot be readily used in such situations, because unpredictable atmospheric movements can result in a faulty weld. Shielded metal arc welding is also often used in underwater welding in the construction and repair of ships, offshore platforms, and pipelines, but others, such as flux cored arc welding and gas tungsten arc welding, are also common. Welding in space is also possible—it was first attempted in 1969 by Russian cosmonauts during the Soyuz 6 mission, when they performed experiments to test shielded metal arc welding, plasma arc welding, and electron beam welding in a depressurized environment. Further testing of these methods was done in the following decades, and today researchers continue to develop methods for using other welding processes in space, such as laser beam welding, resistance welding, and friction welding. Advances in these areas may be useful for future endeavours similar to the construction of the International Space Station, which could rely on welding for joining in space the parts that were manufactured on Earth.

==Safety issues==

Welding can be dangerous and unhealthy if the proper precautions are not taken. Potential safety risks come from fumes, ultraviolet radiation, heat, electric currents, and vibrations. New technology, safe work practices, and proper protection reduce the risks of injury or death from welding.

Since many common welding procedures involve an open flame or electric arc, the risk of burns and fire is significant; this is why it is classified as a hot work process. To prevent injury, welders wear personal protective equipment in the form of heavy leather gloves and protective long-sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. Synthetic clothing such as polyester should not be worn. Wool is less flammable than cotton, but dense cotton fabrics such as denim are still sufficient for clothing. However, any molten material that splatters onto synthetic material will melt directly through the fabric resulting in severe burns.

Arc welding produces intense visible and ultraviolet light. Typical gas metal arc welding has an irradiance of 5W/m2 for the welder, which is many times brighter than sunlight. This can cause a condition called arc eye or flash burns, in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea, and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Welding helmets with dark UV-filtering face plates are worn to prevent this exposure. Many helmets include an auto-darkening face plate, which instantly darkens upon exposure to the intense UV light. To protect bystanders, the welding area is often surrounded by translucent welding curtains. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield people outside the welding area from the UV light of the electric arc, but they cannot replace the filter glass used in helmets. The light can also burn exposed skin. Because of the less intense light produced in oxyfuel welding, goggles that use less UV filtering and do not protect the entire face are sufficient.

Depending on the type of material, welding varieties, and other factors, welding can produce over 100 dB(A) of noise. Above 85 dB(A), earplugs should be worn. Long-term or continuous exposure to higher decibels can lead to noise-induced hearing loss. Processes that produce vibrations sufficient to numb a welder&#x27;s hands are automated because PPE cannot offer sufficient protection.


Welders are often exposed to dangerous gases and particulate matter. Processes like flux-cored arc welding and shielded metal arc welding produce smoke containing particles of various types of oxides. The size of the particles in question tends to influence the toxicity of the fumes, with smaller particles presenting a greater danger. This is because smaller particles can cross the blood–brain barrier. Fumes and gases, such as carbon dioxide, ozone, and fumes containing heavy metals, can be dangerous to welders lacking proper ventilation and training. Exposure to manganese welding fumes, for example, even at low levels (&lt;0.2 mg/m3), may cause neurological problems or damage to the lungs, liver, kidneys, or central nervous system. Nano particles can become trapped in the alveolar macrophages of the lungs and induce pulmonary fibrosis. The use of compressed gases and flames in many welding processes poses an explosion and fire risk. Some common precautions include limiting the amount of oxygen in the air, and keeping combustible materials away from the workplace.

There are several technologies to mitigate dangers from welding fumes. Local exhaust ventilation (LEV) solutions remove fumes, smoke, and dust directly from the welding area. Forms of LEV include downdraft benches, fume hoods, and fume extraction welding guns. Downdraft benches have exhaust ducts beneath the metal welding table. Fume extraction guns have a vacuum hose that runs down to the welding nozzle. Movable fume hoods can positioned directly over the welding area. Even with ventilation, there are still respiratory risks that respirators can further reduce. Studies have shown that respirators, especially half-mask elastomeric respirators, significantly decrease particulate inhalation.

==Costs and trends==
As an industrial process, the cost of welding plays a crucial role in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including equipment cost, labor cost, material cost, and energy cost. Depending on the process, equipment cost can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and oxyfuel welding, to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam welding and electron beam welding. Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor cost depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the hourly wage, and the total operation time, including time spent fitting, welding, and handling the part. The cost of materials includes the cost of the base and filler material, and the cost of shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on arc time and welding power demand.

For manual welding methods, labor costs generally make up the vast majority of the total cost. As a result, many cost-saving measures are focused on minimizing operation time. To do this, welding procedures with high deposition rates can be selected, and weld parameters can be fine-tuned to increase welding speed. Mechanization and automation are often implemented to reduce labor costs, but this frequently increases the cost of equipment and creates additional setup time. Material costs tend to increase when special properties are necessary, and energy costs normally do not amount to more than several percent of the total welding cost.

In recent years, in order to minimize labor costs in high production manufacturing, industrial welding has become increasingly more automated, most notably with the use of robots in resistance spot welding (especially in the automotive industry) and in arc welding. In robot welding, mechanized devices both hold the material and perform the weld and at first, spot welding was its most common application, but robotic arc welding increases in popularity as technology advances. Other key areas of research and development include the welding of dissimilar materials (such as steel and aluminum, for example) and new welding processes, such as friction stir, magnetic pulse, conductive heat seam, and laser-hybrid welding. Furthermore, progress is desired in making more specialized methods like laser beam welding practical for more applications, such as in the aerospace and automotive industries. Researchers also hope to better understand the often unpredictable properties of welds, especially microstructure, residual stresses, and a weld&#x27;s tendency to crack or deform.

The trend of accelerating the speed at which welds are performed in the steel erection industry comes at a risk to the integrity of the connection. Without proper fusion to the base materials provided by sufficient arc time on the weld, a project inspector cannot ensure the effective diameter of the puddle weld therefore he or she cannot guarantee the published load capacities unless they witness the actual installation. This method of puddle welding is common in the United States and Canada for attaching steel sheets to bar joist and structural steel members. Regional agencies are responsible for ensuring the proper installation of puddle welding on steel construction sites. Currently there is no standard or weld procedure which can ensure the published holding capacity of any unwitnessed connection, but this is under review by the American Welding Society.

==Glass and plastic welding==


Glasses and certain types of plastics are commonly welded materials. Unlike metals, which have a specific melting point, glasses and plastics have a melting range, called the glass transition. When heating the solid material past the glass-transition temperature (Tg) into this range, it will generally become softer and more pliable. When it crosses through the range, above the glass-melting temperature (Tm), it will become a very thick, sluggish, viscous liquid, slowly decreasing in viscosity as temperature increases. Typically, this viscous liquid will have very little surface tension compared to metals, becoming a sticky, taffy to honey-like consistency, so welding can usually take place by simply pressing two melted surfaces together. The two liquids will generally mix and join at first contact. Upon cooling through the glass transition, the welded piece will solidify as one solid piece of amorphous material.

===Glass welding===
Glass welding is a common practice during glassblowing. It is used very often in the construction of lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, depending on the type of glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.

Because glass is very brittle in its solid state, it is often prone to cracking upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven. This is because the brittleness of glass does not allow for uneven thermal expansion. Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the glass transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient.

There are many types of glass, and it is most common to weld using the same types. Different glasses often have different rates of thermal expansion, which can cause them to crack upon cooling when they contract differently. For instance, quartz has very low thermal expansion, while soda-lime glass has very high thermal expansion. When welding different glasses to each other, it is usually important to closely match their coefficients of thermal expansion, to ensure that cracking does not occur. Also, some glasses will simply not mix with others, so welding between certain types may not be possible.

Glass can also be welded to metals and ceramics, although with metals the process is usually more adhesion to the surface of the metal rather than a commingling of the two materials. However, certain glasses will typically bond only to certain metals. For example, lead glass bonds readily to copper or molybdenum, but not to aluminum. Tungsten electrodes are often used in lighting but will not bond to quartz glass, so the tungsten is often wetted with molten borosilicate glass, which bonds to both tungsten and quartz. However, care must be taken to ensure that all materials have similar coefficients of thermal expansion to prevent cracking both when the object cools and when it is heated again. Special alloys are often used for this purpose, ensuring that the coefficients of expansion match, and sometimes thin, metallic coatings may be applied to a metal to create a good bond with the glass.

===Plastic welding===
Plastics are generally divided into two categories, which are &quot;thermosets&quot; and &quot;thermoplastics.&quot; A thermoset is a plastic in which a chemical reaction sets the molecular bonds after first forming the plastic, and then the bonds cannot be broken again without degrading the plastic. Thermosets cannot be melted, therefore, once a thermoset has set it is impossible to weld it. Examples of thermosets include epoxies, silicone, vulcanized rubber, polyester, and polyurethane.

Thermoplastics, by contrast, form long molecular chains, which are often coiled or intertwined, forming an amorphous structure without any long-range, crystalline order. Some thermoplastics may be fully amorphous, while others have a partially crystalline/partially amorphous structure. Both amorphous and semicrystalline thermoplastics have a glass transition, above which welding can occur, but semicrystallines also have a specific melting point which is above the glass transition. Above this melting point, the viscous liquid will become a free-flowing liquid (see rheological weldability for thermoplastics). Examples of thermoplastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride (PVC), and fluoroplastics like Teflon and Spectralon.

Welding thermoplastic with heat is very similar to welding glass. The plastic first must be cleaned and then heated through the glass transition, turning the weld-interface into a thick, viscous liquid. Two heated interfaces can then be pressed together, allowing the molecules to mix through intermolecular diffusion, joining them as one. Then the plastic is cooled through the glass transition, allowing the weld to solidify. A filler rod may often be used for certain types of joints. The main differences between welding glass and plastic are the types of heating methods, the much lower melting temperatures, and the fact that plastics will burn if overheated. Many different methods have been devised for heating plastic to a weldable temperature without burning it. Ovens or electric heating tools can be used to melt the plastic. Ultrasonic, laser, or friction heating are other methods. Resistive metals may be implanted in the plastic, which respond to induction heating. Some plastics will begin to burn at temperatures lower than their glass transition, so welding can be performed by blowing a heated, inert gas onto the plastic, melting it while, at the same time, shielding it from oxygen.

====Solvent welding====

Many thermoplastics can also be welded using chemical solvents. When placed in contact with the plastic, the solvent will begin to soften it, bringing the surface into a thick, liquid solution. When two melted surfaces are pressed together, the molecules in the solution mix, joining them as one. Because the solvent can permeate the plastic, the solvent evaporates out through the surface of the plastic, causing the weld to drop out of solution and solidify. A common use for solvent welding is for joining PVC (polyvinyl chloride) or ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) pipes during plumbing, or for welding styrene and polystyrene plastics in the construction of models. Solvent welding is especially effective on plastics like PVC which burn at or below their glass transition, but may be ineffective on plastics like Teflon or polyethylene that are resistant to chemical decomposition.

<doc id="44885" wikidata="Q856274" url="?curid=44885" title="Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?">
<text>Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a play by Edward Albee first staged in October 1962. It examines the complexities of the marriage of middle-aged couple Martha and George. Late one evening, after a university faculty party, they receive unwitting younger couple Nick and Honey as guests, and draw them into their bitter and frustrated relationship.

The three-act play normally takes just under three hours to perform, with two 10 minute intermissions. The title is a pun on the song &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?&quot; from Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; (1933), substituting the name of the celebrated English author Virginia Woolf. Martha and George repeatedly sing this version of the song throughout the play.

&quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; won both the 1963 Tony Award for Best Play and the 1962–1963 New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award for Best Play. It is frequently revived on the modern stage. The film adaptation was released in 1966, written by Ernest Lehman, directed by Mike Nichols, and starring Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, George Segal, and Sandy Dennis.

==Plot summary==
===Act One: &quot;Fun and Games&quot;===
George is an associate professor of history, and his wife Martha is the daughter of the president of the college where George teaches. After they return home from a faculty party, Martha reveals she has invited a young married couple she met at the party over for a drink. (Also cut in the definitive edition: Just before the couple—Nick and Honey—arrives, George gives a vague warning about &quot;the bit with the kid&quot; that Martha appears to understand.)

As the four drink, Martha and George engage in scathing verbal abuse of each other in front of Nick and Honey. These interactions embarrass the younger couple, but they stay. At one point, Honey lets on that Martha told her about their son, which appears to unnerve George. After this, Martha&#x27;s taunts and George&#x27;s passive aggression only increase. When Martha launches into an embarrassing story about how she humiliated him with a sucker punch at a backyard party, George disappears. The story continues, with Nick and Honey laughing, until George appears with a rifle and fires at Martha. To their surprise, a Chinese parasol pops out of the gun barrel. Everyone finds this extremely funny, but Martha quickly resumes her taunting of George, which culminates in Martha relating how her father had thought that George would eventually rise to lead the college, but George&#x27;s lack of ambition has made him pathetic to Martha, who calls him a &quot;great big fat flop&quot;. George reacts violently by breaking a bottle. Honey, who has grown more and more deliriously drunk, quickly runs to the bathroom to vomit, leaving George alone with glass all over the room.

===Act Two: &quot;Walpurgisnacht&quot;===
:(Traditionally, &quot;Walpurgisnacht&quot; is the name of an annual witches&#x27; meeting, satiric in the context of the play.)

Nick returns to find George alone. As they talk about their wives, Nick reveals that Honey once had a &quot;hysterical pregnancy&quot;. George tells Nick about a time he went to a gin mill with some boarding school classmates, one of whom had accidentally killed his mother by shooting her. This friend was mocked for ordering &quot;bergin&quot; (bourbon). The following summer, the young friend was driving with his father and suddenly swerved to avoid a porcupine, accidentally killing his father. The boy was then sent to an asylum and became mute. As the story concludes, George and Nick discuss children, but the conversation turns insulting before Martha and Honey return.

Honey calls for music, so they put on a record. Because George refuses to dance, Martha dances with Nick, taunting George by making the dance very sensual while she tells another embarrassing story about George: his efforts to publish a novel about a boy who accidentally killed both of his parents (with the insinuation that the deaths were actually murder), but Martha&#x27;s father would not let it be published. George attacks Martha, but Nick separates them. Clearly not satisfied, George launches into a new &quot;game&quot; called &quot;Get the Guests&quot;, in which George begins telling a story about a &quot;mousie&quot; that is a thinly-veiled retelling of everything Nick told George about Honey, including her alcoholism and her &quot;hysterical pregnancy&quot;, implying that Honey &quot;trapped&quot; Nick into marrying her by pretending to be pregnant. Honey, devastated, again runs to the bathroom to vomit.

Martha begins to openly seduce Nick in the living room right in front of George, who blithely smiles and pretends to read a book. This greatly annoys Martha, who tells George that if he does nothing to stop her, she&#x27;ll have sex with Nick. George is unmoved, so Martha goes upstairs with Nick. Immediately, an enraged George throws his book against the house&#x27;s doorbell chimes, which ring out as he promises to make Martha &quot;regret this.&quot;

In some productions until 2006, Honey then returns, wondering who rang the doorbell. George then interrogates Honey about her pregnancy, then openly tells Honey that he is going to inform Martha that their son has died. In a 2006 revision by the author of the script, however, this scene is cut.

===Act Three: &quot;The Exorcism&quot;===
:(Exorcism is the expulsion or attempted expulsion of a supposed evil spirit from a person or place.)

Martha enters an empty living room and shouts for the others to come out of hiding. Nick joins her. The doorbell rings, and George enters carrying snapdragons and making literary jokes that Martha seems to actually enjoy. Martha and George then argue about whether the moon is up, an odd game whose metaphors reveal that Nick was too drunk to have sex with Martha upstairs.

George asks Nick to bring Honey back for the final game, &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;. Nick and Honey sit helplessly as George, at last, talks openly about his and Martha&#x27;s son. As he accuses Martha of being overbearing to their son, she protests, leading George to ask for her &quot;recitation&quot;. Martha agrees, and begins to recall their son&#x27;s beauty and talents and accuses George of ruining his life. As she speaks, George recites sections of the &quot;Libera me&quot; (part of the &quot;Requiem Mass&quot;, the Latin mass for the dead) and &quot;Kyrie eleison&quot; (ancient Greek: &quot;Lord, have mercy&quot;).

This continues until George informs Martha that the doorbell earlier was a messenger from Western Union arriving with a telegram that George says informed him that their son was dead, having been killed in a car crash when he swerved to avoid a porcupine—the exact wording that George earlier used in a story about a completely different person. Martha demands proof, but George insists on the reality of the situation. Martha, distraught, collapses. It slowly dawns on Nick that the son George and Martha have been talking about is not real. The fictional son is a &quot;game&quot; the two have been playing since discovering early in their marriage that they are infertile. George has decided to &quot;kill&quot; him because Martha broke the game&#x27;s single rule: not to mention the boy to anyone else.

Overcome with pity, Nick and Honey leave. Martha suggests that they could invent a new imaginary child, but George insists they cannot. The play ends with George singing &quot;Who&#x27;s afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, a joke song someone sang that night at the faculty party. Martha weakly replies, &quot;I am, George. I am.&quot;

==Themes==
===Reality and illusion===
Albee has said that the title of the play &quot;means who&#x27;s afraid of the big bad wolf ... who&#x27;s afraid of living life without false illusions.&quot; Albee&#x27;s interest in the theme of reality versus illusion is expressed in a number of his plays. In discussing &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; he cites Nietzsche&#x27;s interpretation of the Apollonian/Dionysian dichotomy of ancient Greek drama, as described in &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot;. Albee says,

There was a time when people believed in deities. And then revolutions came – industrial, French, Freudian, Marxist. God and absolutes vanished. Individuals find this very difficult and uncomfortable. All they have left is fantasy or the examination of the self.

According to Lawrence Kingsley, Albee&#x27;s characters create illusions to help them evade feelings of their own inadequacy – as &quot;George and Martha have evaded the ugliness of their marriage by taking refuge in illusion.&quot; The play demonstrates &quot;how his characters must rid themselves of falsehood and return to the world in which they must live.&quot;

The distinction between truth and illusion is at times deliberately unclear. The existence of the child, the &quot;murder&quot; by George of his parents, or Honey&#x27;s &quot;pregnancy&quot; may be illusions, but they seem real to the characters. Illusions may be exorcised in the play, but no truth or apparent reality is supplied in its place. &quot;All truth&quot;, George says, &quot; relative&quot;.

===Critique of societal expectations===
Christopher Bigsby asserts that this play opposes the idea of a perfect American family and societal expectations as it &quot;attacks the false optimism and myopic confidence of modern society&quot;. Albee takes a heavy-handed approach to displaying this contrast, making examples of every character and their expectations of the people around them. Societal norms of the 1950s consisted of a nuclear family: two parents and two (or more) children. This conception was picturesque in the idea that the father was the breadwinner, the mother a homemaker, and the children well-behaved.

&quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; smashes these conventions and shows realistic families that are far from perfect and possibly ruined. The families of Honey and Martha were dominated by their fathers, with no sign of a mother figure in their lives. George and Martha&#x27;s chance at a perfect family was ruined by infertility and George&#x27;s failure to become a prominent figure at the university.

==Inspirations==
===Title===
The play&#x27;s title alludes to the English novelist Virginia Woolf. She died by suicide at age 59 in 1941. She left behind a note in which she expressed love for her husband Leonard Woolf and sorrow for the anguish she was causing him. Twenty years later, playwright Edward Albee corresponded with him, asking permission to use his late wife&#x27;s name in the title of a new play, according to literary critic Leon Edel, an acquaintance of Leonard Woolf. Woolf granted permission, according to Edel.

Edward Albee&#x27;s title also pokes fun at the song &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?&quot; from Walt Disney&#x27;s animated version of &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot;. Because the rights to the Disney song are expensive, most stage versions, and the film, have Martha sing to the tune of &quot;Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush&quot;, a melody that fits the meter fairly well and is in the public domain. In the first few moments of the play, it is revealed that someone sang the song earlier in the evening at a party, although who first sang it (Martha or some other anonymous party guest) remains unclear. Martha repeatedly needles George over whether he found it funny.

Albee described the inspiration for the title:

I was in there having a beer one night, and I saw &quot;Who&#x27;s afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; scrawled in soap, I suppose, on this mirror. When I started to write the play it cropped up in my mind again. And of course, &quot;who&#x27;s afraid of Virginia Woolf&quot; means who&#x27;s afraid of the big &quot;bad&quot; wolf – who&#x27;s afraid of living life without false illusions. And it did strike me as being a rather typical, university intellectual joke.

The title phrase happened to appear five years before the play&#x27;s premiere, in a 1957 issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;:

A coffee fiend we know dropped into an &quot;espresso&quot; joint in Greenwich Village the other day and found himself whiling away his time reading the graffiti on the wall beside his chair. Most of the stuff was pretty humdrum, but he was arrested by a legend, done in elegant calligraphy, that read, &quot;Who&#x27;s afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;

&quot;The New Yorker&quot; responded in 2013 by suggesting that perhaps the graffiti that Albee saw was the same graffiti that &quot;The New Yorker&quot; reported in 1957.

===Characters===
In an interview, Albee said Martha and George were based on two of his friends, married New York socialites Willard Maas and Marie Menken. Maas was a professor of literature at Wagner College and Menken was an experimental filmmaker and painter. Maas and Menken were known for their infamous salons, where drinking would &quot;commence at 4  on Friday and end in the wee hours of night on Monday&quot; (according to Gerard Malanga, an Andy Warhol associate and friend to Maas). The primary conflict between George and Martha in &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; derived from Maas&#x27;s and Menken&#x27;s tempestuous and volatile relationship.

==Production history==

===Original production===
The print edition of the play was published in 1962 and was one of the early releases of Atheneum Books. It sold over 70,000 copies in hard and soft cover editions.

&quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; opened on Broadway at the Billy Rose Theatre on 13 October 1962. The original cast featured Uta Hagen as Martha, Arthur Hill as George, Melinda Dillon as Honey, and George Grizzard as Nick. It was directed by Alan Schneider. Subsequent cast members included Henderson Forsythe, Eileen Fulton, Nancy Kelly, Mercedes McCambridge, and Elaine Stritch.

Because of the play&#x27;s unusual length (over three hours), the producers also cast a matinee company that performed twice a week, featuring Kate Reid as Martha, Shepperd Strudwick as George, Avra Petrides as Honey, and Bill Berger as Nick. As with the evening company, these matinee performances also sold out.

The play closed on 16 May 1964, after 5 previews and 664 performances. It opened in London in 1965, starring Constance Cummings. Virginia Woolf&#x27;s widower Leonard attended a performance and enjoyed it, according to an acquaintance of his, literary critic Leon Edel.

====Original Broadway cast album====
In 1963, Columbia Masterworks released a four-LP boxed recording of the original Broadway cast performing the entire play, directed by Alan Schneider.

The release contained a 16 page booklet with photos from the original production, critical essays by Harold Clurman and Walter Kerr, cast and crew biographies, and a short article by Goddard Lieberson on the task of recording the play. The introduction is by Albee, in which he writes, &quot;I cannot conceive of anyone wanting to buy [this] massive album; but ... every playwright wants as much permanence for his work as he can get.&quot;

The recording was issued in both stereo (DOS 687) and monaural (DOL 287) formats. It was out of print for many years, was not released in other formats, and is highly prized among collectors, as a play with such adult themes had never been recorded for the general public before. It was finally re-released in 2014 by Masterworks Broadway.

=== Notable productions ===
In 1970, Henry Fonda and Richard Burton attempted to recruit Warren Beatty and Jon Voight for an all-male production, but Albee refused permission.

Colleen Dewhurst and Ben Gazzara starred in a 1976 Broadway revival.

Mike Nichols and Elaine May starred in a 1980 production in New Haven.

Diana Rigg and David Suchet starred in a 1996 production of the play at the Almeida Theatre in London before transferring to the Aldwych Theatre in London&#x27;s West End in 1997.

Patrick Stewart and Mercedes Ruehl starred in a 2000–2001 production at The Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis.

The play was revived on Broadway at the Longacre Theatre, opening on 12 March 2005, in previews and closing on 4 September 2005, after 8 previews and 177 performances. Directed by Anthony Page, it starred Kathleen Turner as Martha and Bill Irwin as George, with Mireille Enos as Honey and David Harbour as Nick. Irwin won the 2005 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play for his role. The production transferred to London&#x27;s West End at the Apollo Theatre with the entire original cast, running from 31 January to 13 May 2006. In January 2007, the production played at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, for one month. On 6 February 2007, the production began a six-week run at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles.

Notably, it was this 2005 production that led to the publication of a revised script – one that has been used ever since – although many of its revisions were introduced in earlier productions. Among the revisions was the removal of early references to George and Martha&#x27;s son, as well as the reference to the fact that George felt that he helped cause his parents&#x27; death, which was originally the subject of his failed novel. A roughly 7 page scene with George and Honey at the end of Act II has also been removed completely. These and other changes seem to be there to clarify plot points, but arguably rob the play of some of its ambiguity and tenuous relationship with realism.

The play toured in the US and played in San Francisco at the Golden Gate Theatre from 11 April – 12 May 2007.

On 12 December 2010, the Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago began performances of the play featuring Amy Morton as Martha, Tracy Letts (the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright of &quot;&quot;) as George, Carrie Coon, and Madison Dirks. The production was directed by Pam MacKinnon, who previously directed the premieres of Albee&#x27;s &quot;Peter and Jerry&quot; and &quot;Occupant&quot;. This production began previews on Broadway at the Booth Theatre on 27 September 2012, opening on 13 October, 50 years after the original Broadway opening. MacKinnon again directed, with the Steppenwolf cast reprising their roles. The production and cast received praise in &quot;The New York Times&quot; from reviewer Charles Isherwood. Letts won the 2013 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play.

Meg Tilly returned to acting in 2011 to play Martha in a production by Blue Bridge Repertory Theatre. The show ran from 5 July – 17 July 2011, in Victoria, British Columbia.

On 21 February 2017, a production directed by James Macdonald began at the Harold Pinter Theatre in London, featuring Imelda Staunton, Conleth Hill, Imogen Poots, and Luke Treadaway. It ran until 27 May 2017.

A Broadway revival was scheduled to premiere on 9 April 2020, in a production directed by Joe Mantello and produced by Scott Rudin. It was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic after 9 preview performances, without officially opening. It starred Laurie Metcalf, Rupert Everett, Russell Tovey, and Patsy Ferran. Eddie Izzard had been set to play George, but it was announced on 11 September 2019, that Everett would replace her.

===Dance interpretation===
In 1995 and 1996, the Canadian One Yellow Rabbit troupe mounted a homage in dance to Albee, &quot;Permission&quot;, in the form of an hour-long ballet inspired by &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf&quot;. It was performed in Calgary, Toronto, Phoenix, Guadalajara, and Mexico City.

==Sequels and parodies==
In 2018 the Elevator Repair Service premiered a sequel written by Kate Scelsa, titled &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Fine with Virginia Woolf&quot;. This play introduces new plot elements such as vampirism.

Multiple television shows have episodes parodying the original play. Season 3, Episode 1 of &quot;American Dad!&quot; features a sub-plot in which the characters of Roger and Francine pretend to be a university professor and his wife. After inviting over a young couple, the two behave much like the characters of George and Martha. The episode concludes with Roger &quot;killing&quot; their imaginary child much like George does in the play.

The critically acclaimed &quot;Dinner Party&quot; episode of &quot;The Office&quot; (Season 4, Episode 13) was originally titled &quot;Virginia Woolf&quot; by writers Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg. This episode is a parody in which Michael invites new couple Jim and Pam to a dinner party that slowly devolves into a chaotic exhibition of Michael&#x27;s tense relationship with his girlfriend and former boss, Jan.

Season 2, Episode 4 of &quot;Our Flag Means Death&quot; is a parody in which the dysfunctional relationship of Anne Bonny and Mary Read is meant to parallel that of George and Martha, and whose antics instigate a reconciliation of Ed and Stede.

==Awards==
&quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; won both the 1963 Tony Award for Best Play and the 1962–1963 New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award for Best Play. Its stars won the 1963 Tony Awards for Best Actor and Actress. It was selected for the 1963 Pulitzer Prize for Drama by that award&#x27;s drama jury, but the award&#x27;s advisory board – the trustees of Columbia University – objected to its profanity and sexual themes, and overruled the jury, awarding no Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1963.

The 2005 revivial won the 2005 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play for Bill Irwin&#x27;s role.

The 2012 revival won the 2013 Tony Awards for Best Revival of a Play, Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Play (Letts), and Best Direction of a Play (MacKinnon).

==Film==
A film adaptation of the play was released in 1966. It was directed by Mike Nichols and starred Elizabeth Taylor as Martha, Richard Burton as George, George Segal as Nick, and Sandy Dennis as Honey. All four actors were nominated for Academy Awards: Taylor and Burton for Best Actress and Actor and Dennis and Segal for Supporting Oscars. Taylor won the Oscar for Best Actress but Burton was passed over that year in favor of Paul Scofield in &quot;A Man For All Seasons&quot;. Dennis won Best Actress in a Supporting Role, while Segal lost to Walter Matthau in &quot;The Fortune Cookie&quot;.

Jack Valenti identified the film as the first controversial film he had to deal with as president of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). It was the first to use the slang &quot;screw&quot; and the phrase &quot;hump the hostess&quot;. As he said,
In company with the MPAA&#x27;s general counsel, Louis Nizer, I met with Jack Warner, the legendary chieftain of Warner, and his top aide, Ben Kalmenson. We talked for three hours, and the result was deletion of &#x27;screw&#x27; and retention of &#x27;hump the hostess&#x27;, but I was uneasy over the meeting.

===Original film soundtrack album===
The film was given a &quot;Deluxe Edition Two-Record Set&quot; soundtrack album release in 1967 by Warner Bros. Records, and was the first film to have its vocals be released in their entirety on an album, as the film at that time could not be shown on network television. It contains the vocals of the four actors performing in the film. The only music on the album is a song, &quot;Virginia Woolf Rock&quot;, that plays while Martha and Nick are dancing (but plays a little differently than it does in the film).

In at least two instances alternative takes were used: Taylor&#x27;s memorable &quot;Goddamn you!&quot; line is restored to &quot;Screw you!&quot;, and some of the dialogue from the dancing sequence was lifted from another take. As Martha tells Nick and Honey her story about punching George in the stomach in front of her father, it is heard very clearly while in the film it becomes muffled as the camera follows George into another room to get a gun. The album also runs half an hour shorter than the film, since most pauses and long silences were removed, but virtually every line remains intact. The album&#x27;s cover has the four main actors and the back cover has some background information about them, the five-month shooting schedule, and Albee, and a brief synopsis of the film.

<text>Pope Sixtus V (; 13 December 1521 – 27 August 1590), born Felice Piergentile, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 24 April 1585 to his death, in August 1590. As a youth, he joined the Franciscan order, where he displayed talents as a scholar and preacher, and enjoyed the patronage of Pius V, who made him a cardinal. As a cardinal, he was known as Cardinal Montalto.

As Pope, he energetically rooted out corruption and lawlessness across Rome, and launched a far-sighted rebuilding programme that continues to provoke controversy, as it involved the destruction of antiquities. The cost of these works was met by heavy taxation which caused much suffering. His foreign policy was regarded as over-ambitious; he excommunicated King Henry IV of France and renewed the excommunication of Queen Elizabeth I of England. He is recognized as a significant figure of the Counter-Reformation. He is the most recent pope to date to take on the pontifical name &quot;Sixtus&quot;.

==Early life==
Felice Piergentile was born on 13 December 1521 at Grottammare, in the Papal States, to Francesco Piergentile (also known as Peretto di Montalto, from the city of origin Montalto delle Marche), and Mariana da Frontillo. His father had taken refuge in Grottammare to escape the oppression of the Duke of Urbino, finding there a job as a gardener. Felice later adopted &quot;Peretti&quot; as his family name in 1551, and as a cardinal was known as &quot;Cardinal Montalto&quot; (to reflect his affection for his homeland).

===Franciscan===
At the age of 9 years, Felice returned to Montalto to join his uncle in the Franciscan Convent of San Francesco delle Fratte. At the age of 12, he was initiated as a novice of the Franciscan Order, assuming the name of Fra Felice (Friar Felix) in 1535, maintaining his birth name. From this year, he started philosophical and theological studies, moving between different convents of the Order. He finally completed his studies in the Franciscan Magna Domus of Bologna on September 1544. Three years earlier he had been ordained as a deacon.

About 1552 he was noticed by Cardinal Rodolfo Pio da Carpi, Protector of the Franciscan order, Cardinal Ghislieri (later Pope Pius V) and Cardinal Caraffa (later Pope Paul IV), and from that time his advancement was assured. He was sent to Venice as inquisitor general of the Venetian Holy Inquisition, but was so severe and conducted matters in such a high-handed manner that he became embroiled in quarrels. In 1560, the Venetian government asked for his recall.

After a brief term as procurator of his order, he was attached in 1565 to the papal legation to Spain headed by Cardinal Ugo Boncampagni (later Pope Gregory XIII) which was sent to investigate a charge of heresy levelled against Bartolomé Carranza, Archbishop of Toledo. The violent dislike which Peretti conceived for Boncampagni had a marked influence on his subsequent actions. He hurried back to Rome upon the accession of Pius V, who made him apostolic vicar of his order and then, in 1570, cardinal.

===Cardinal===
During the pontificate of his political enemy Gregory XIII (1572–1585), Cardinal Montalto, as he was generally called, lived in enforced retirement, occupied with the care of his property, the Villa Montalto, erected by Domenico Fontana close to the cardinal&#x27;s beloved church on the Esquiline Hill, overlooking the ancient Baths of Diocletian. The first phase (1576–1580) of the building was enlarged after Peretti became pope and was able to clear buildings to open four new streets in 1585–86. The villa contained two residences, the &quot;Palazzo Sistino&quot; or &quot;Palazzo di Termini&quot; and the casino, called the &quot;Palazzetto Montalto e Felice&quot;.

This clearance programme was an undoubted gain in the relief it brought to the congestion of the crowded medieval city. Clearly, however, Romans displaced by it were furious, and resentment was still felt centuries later until the decision was taken to build Roma Termini railway station, inaugurated by Pope Pius IX in 1863, on the site of the Villa, which became doomed to destruction.

Cardinal Montalto&#x27;s other occupation at this period was with his studies, one of the fruits of which was an edition of the works of Ambrose. As pope he would personally supervise the printing of an improved edition of Jerome&#x27;s Vulgate.

==Papacy==
===Election as pope===
Though not neglecting to follow the course of affairs, Felice carefully avoided every occasion of offence. This discretion contributed not a little to his election to the papacy on 24 April 1585, with the title of Sixtus V to honour Pope Sixtus IV, also a Franciscan like himself. One of the things that commended his candidacy to certain cardinals may have been his physical vigour, which seemed to promise a long pontificate. His papal coronation was held on 1 May 1585 and he was crowned by the protodeacon Ferdinando de&#x27; Medici.

===Reforms in the city of Rome===
The terrible condition in which Pope Gregory XIII had left the Papal States called for prompt and stern measures. Sixtus proceeded with an almost ferocious severity against the prevailing lawlessness. Thousands of brigands were brought to justice: within a short time, the country was again quiet and safe. It was claimed that there were more heads on spikes across the Ponte Sant&#x27;Angelo than melons for sale in the marketplace. And clergy and nuns were executed if they broke their vows of chastity.

Next Sixtus set to work to repair the finances. By the sale of offices, the establishment of a new &quot;Monti&quot; and by levying new taxes, he accumulated a vast surplus, which he stored up against certain specified emergencies, such as a crusade or the defence of the Holy See. Sixtus prided himself upon his hoard, but the method by which it had been amassed was financially unsound: some of the taxes proved ruinous, and the withdrawal of so much money from circulation could not fail to cause distress.

Immense sums were spent upon public works, in carrying through the comprehensive planning that had come to fruition during his retirement, bringing water to the waterless hills via his new aqueduct, the Acqua Felice which fed twenty-seven new fountains; laying out new arteries in Rome, which connected the great basilicas, even setting his engineer-architect Domenico Fontana to replan the Colosseum as a silk-spinning factory housing its workers.

Inspired by the ideal of the Renaissance city, Pope Sixtus V&#x27;s ambitious urban reform programme transformed the old environment to emulate the &quot;long straight streets, wide regular spaces, uniformity and repetitiveness of structures, lavish use of commemorative and ornamental elements, and maximum visibility from both linear and circular perspective.&quot; The Pope set no limit to his plans, and achieved much in his short pontificate, always carried through at top speed: the completion of the dome of St. Peter&#x27;s; the loggia of Sixtus in the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano; the chapel of the Praesepe in Santa Maria Maggiore; additions or repairs to the Quirinal, Lateran and Vatican palaces; the erection of four obelisks, including that in Saint Peter&#x27;s Square; the opening of six streets; the restoration of the aqueduct of Septimius Severus (&quot;Acqua Felice&quot;); the integration of the Leonine City in Rome as XIV rione (Borgo).

Besides numerous roads and bridges, he improved the city&#x27;s air by financing the reclamation of the Pontine Marshes. Good progress was made, with more than reclaimed and opened to agriculture and manufacture. The project was abandoned upon his death.

Sixtus had no appreciation of antiquities, which were employed as raw material to serve his urbanistic and Christianising programs: Trajan&#x27;s Column and the Column of Marcus Aurelius (at the time misidentified as the Column of Antoninus Pius) were made to serve as pedestals for the statues of SS Peter and Paul; the Minerva of the Capitol was converted into an emblem of &quot;Christian Rome&quot;; the Septizodium of Septimius Severus was demolished for building materials.

The spatial organization, monumental inscriptions and restorations throughout the city reinforced the control, surveillance, and authority that alluded to his power.

===Church administration===
The subsequent administrative system of the Catholic Church owed much to Sixtus. He limited the College of Cardinals to seventy. He doubled the number of the congregations and enlarged their functions, assigning to them the principal role in the transaction of business (1588). He regarded the Jesuits with disfavour and suspicion. He considered radical changes to their constitution, but death prevented the execution of his purpose.

In 1588, he established the 15 congregations by his constitution &quot;Immensa Aeterni Dei&quot;.

=== Sixtine Vulgate and Septuagint ===
In May 1587, the Sixtine Septuagint was published under the auspices of Sixtus V.

In May 1590 the Sixtine Vulgate was issued. The edition was preceded by the Bull &quot;Aeternus ille&quot;, in which the Pope declared the authenticity of the new Bible. The bull stipulated &quot;that it was to be considered as the authentic edition recommended by the Council of Trent, that it should be taken as the standard of all future reprints, and that all copies should be corrected by it.&quot; &quot;This edition was not to be reprinted for 10 years except at the Vatican, and after that any edition must be compared with the Vatican edition, so that &quot;not even the smallest particle should be altered, added or removed&quot; under pain of the &quot;greater excommunication.&quot; Jaroslav Pelikan, without giving any more details, says that this edition &quot;proved to be so defective that it was withdrawn&quot;.

===Consistories===

Sixtus V created 33 cardinals in eight consistories during his reign, which included his grandnephew Alessandro Peretti di Montalto and his future successor Ippolito Aldobrandini who would later become Pope Clement VIII.

===Beatifications and canonizations===
During his pontificate, Sixtus V beatified Ubaldesca Taccini (1587) and canonized one saint, Didacus of Alcalá (10 July 1588).

=== Roman Curia ===
In 1588, Sixtus V published the bull &quot;Immensa Aeterni Dei&quot; which reorganised the Roman Curia into departments.

===Foreign relations===

In his larger political relations, Sixtus entertained fantastic ambitions, such as the annihilation of the Turks, the conquest of Egypt, the transport of the Holy Sepulchre to Italy, and the accession of his nephew to the throne of France. The situation in which he found himself was difficult: he could not countenance the designs of those he considered as heretical princes, and yet he mistrusted King Philip II of Spain and viewed with apprehension any extension of his power.

Sixtus agreed to renew the excommunication of Queen Elizabeth I of England, and to grant a large subsidy to the Armada of Philip II, but, knowing the slowness of Spain, would give nothing until the expedition actually landed in England. This way, he saved a fortune that would otherwise have been lost in the failed campaign. Sixtus had Cardinal William Allen draw up the &quot;An Admonition to the Nobility and People of England and Ireland&quot;, a proclamation to be published in England if the invasion had been successful. The extant document comprised all that could be said against Elizabeth I, and the indictment is therefore fuller and more forcible than any other put forward by the religious exiles, who were generally reticent in their complaints. Allen carefully consigned his publication to the fire, and it is only known of through one of Elizabeth&#x27;s spies, who had stolen a copy.

Sixtus excommunicated King Henry III of Navarre, who was the heir presumptive to the throne of France, and contributed to the Catholic League, but he chafed under his forced alliance with King Philip II of Spain, and looked for an escape. The victories of Henry and the prospect of his conversion to Catholicism raised Sixtus V&#x27;s hopes, and to a corresponding degree determined Philip II to tighten his grip upon his wavering ally. The Pope&#x27;s negotiations with Henry&#x27;s representative evoked a bitter and menacing protest and a categorical demand for the performance of promises. Sixtus took refuge in evasion and temporised until his death on 27 August 1590.

===Contraception, abortion, and adultery===
Sixtus extended the penalty of excommunication relating to the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s teaching on contraception and on abortion. While the Church taught that abortion and contraception were gravely sinful actions, it did not apply to all mortal sins the additional penalty of excommunication.

Some theologians argued that only after proof of the &quot;quickening&quot; (when the mother can feel the fetus&#x27;s movement in her womb, usually about 20 weeks into gestation) that there was incontrovertible evidence that ensoulment had already occurred. Until Sixtus V, canon lawyers had applied the code from Gratian whereby excommunications were only given to abortions after the quickening. In 1588 the pope issued a papal bull, &quot;Effraenatam&quot; or &quot;Effrenatam&quot; (&quot;Without Restraint&quot;), which declared that the canonical penalty of excommunication would be levied for any form of contraception and for abortions at any stage in fetal development. The reasoning on the latter would be that the soul of the unborn child would be denied Heaven.

Sixtus also attempted in 1586 to introduce into the secular law in Rome the Old Testament penalty for adultery, which is death. The measure ultimately failed.

===Death and legacy===
Sixtus V died on 27 August 1590 from malaria. The pope became ill with a fever on 24 August which intensified the following day.

As Sixtus V lay on his deathbed, he was loathed by his political subjects, but history has recognized him as one of the most important popes. On the negative side, he could be impulsive, obstinate, severe, and autocratic. On the positive side, he was open to large ideas and threw himself into his undertakings with energy and determination; this often led to success. His pontificate saw great enterprises and great achievements.

About 5,000 bandits were executed by Sixtus V in the five years before his death in 1590, but there were reputedly 27,000 more at liberty throughout Central Italy.

<doc id="44887" wikidata="Q7351" url="?curid=44887" title="Robert Schumann">
<text>Robert Schumann (; ; 8 June 181029 July 1856) was a German composer, pianist, and music critic of the early Romantic era. He composed in all the main musical genres of the time, writing for solo piano, voice and piano, chamber groups, orchestra, choir and the opera. His works typify the spirit of the Romantic era in German music.

Schumann was born in Zwickau, Saxony, to an affluent middle-class family with no musical connections, and was initially unsure whether to pursue a career as a lawyer or to make a living as a pianist-composer. He studied law at the universities of Leipzig and Heidelberg but his main interests were music and Romantic literature. From 1829 he was a student of the piano teacher Friedrich Wieck, but his hopes for a career as a virtuoso pianist were frustrated by a worsening problem with his right hand, and he concentrated on composition. His early works were mainly piano pieces, including the large-scale , (Dances of the League of David), (Fantasy Pieces), and (Scenes from Childhood) (1834–1838). He was a co-founder of the (New Musical Journal) in 1834 and edited it for ten years. In his writing for the journal and in his music he distinguished between two contrasting aspects of his personality, dubbing these alter egos &quot;Florestan&quot; for his impetuous self and &quot;Eusebius&quot; for his gentle poetic side.

Despite the bitter opposition of Wieck, who did not regard his pupil as a suitable husband for her, Schumann married Wieck&#x27;s daughter Clara in 1840. In the years immediately following their wedding Schumann composed prolifically, writing, first, songs and song‐cycles including (&quot;Woman&#x27;s Love and Life&quot;) and (&quot;Poet&#x27;s Love&quot;). He turned his attention to orchestral music in 1841, completing the first of his four symphonies. In the following year he concentrated on chamber music, writing three string quartets, a Piano Quintet and a Piano Quartet. During the rest of the 1840s, between bouts of mental and physical ill health, he composed a variety of piano and other pieces and went with his wife on concert tours in Europe. His only opera, &quot;Genoveva&quot; (1850), was not a success and has seldom been staged since.

Schumann and his family moved to Düsseldorf in 1850 in the hope that his appointment as the city&#x27;s director of music would provide financial security, but his shyness and mental instability made it difficult for him to work with his orchestra and he had to resign after three years. In 1853 the Schumanns met the twenty-year-old Johannes Brahms, whom Schumann praised in an article in the . The following year Schumann&#x27;s always-precarious mental health deteriorated gravely. He threw himself into the River Rhine but was rescued and taken to a private sanatorium near Bonn, where he lived for more than two years, dying there at the age of 46.

During his lifetime Schumann was recognised for his piano music – often subtly programmatic – and his songs. His other works were less generally admired, and for many years there was a widespread belief that those from his later years lacked the inspiration of his early music. More recently this view has been less prevalent, but it is still his piano works and songs from the 1830s and 1840s on which his reputation is primarily based. He had considerable influence in the nineteenth century and beyond. In the German-speaking world the composers Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, Arnold Schoenberg and more recently Wolfgang Rihm have been inspired by his music, as were French composers such as Georges Bizet, Gabriel Fauré, Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel. Schumann was also a major influence on the Russian school of composers, including Anton Rubinstein and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.

== Life and career ==
=== Childhood ===

Robert Schumann was born in Zwickau, in the Kingdom of Saxony (today the German state of Saxony), into an affluent middle-class family. On 13 June 1810 the local newspaper, the (Zwickau Weekly Paper), carried the announcement, &quot;On 8 June to Herr August Schumann, notable citizen and bookseller here, a little son&quot;. He was the fifth and last child of August Schumann and his wife, Johanna Christiane. August, not only a bookseller but also a lexicographer, author, and publisher of chivalric romances, made considerable sums from his German translations of writers such as Cervantes, Walter Scott and Lord Byron. Robert, his favourite child, was able to spend many hours exploring the classics of literature in his father&#x27;s collection. Intermittently, between the ages of three and five-and-a-half, he was placed with foster parents, as his mother had contracted typhus.

At the age of six Schumann went to a private preparatory school, where he remained for four years. When he was seven he began studying general music and piano with the local organist, Johann Gottfried Kuntsch, and for a time he also had cello and flute lessons with one of the municipal musicians, Carl Gottlieb Meissner. Throughout his childhood and youth his love of music and literature ran in tandem, with poems and dramatic works produced alongside small-scale compositions, mainly piano pieces and songs. He was not a musical child prodigy like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart or Felix Mendelssohn, but his talent as a pianist was evident from an early age: in 1850 the (Universal Musical Journal) printed a biographical sketch of Schumann which included an account from contemporary sources that even as a boy he possessed a special talent for portraying feelings and characteristic traits in melody:
From 1820 Schumann attended the Zwickau Lyceum, the local high school of about two hundred boys, where he remained till the age of eighteen, studying a traditional curriculum. In addition to his studies he read extensively: among his early enthusiasms were Schiller and Jean Paul. According to the musical historian George Hall, Paul remained Schumann&#x27;s favourite author and exercised a powerful influence on the composer&#x27;s creativity with his sensibility and vein of fantasy. Musically, Schumann got to know the works of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and of living composers Carl Maria von Weber, with whom August Schumann tried unsuccessfully to arrange for Robert to study. August was not particularly musical but he encouraged his son&#x27;s interest in music, buying him a Streicher grand piano and organising trips to Leipzig for a performance of &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; (The Magic Flute) and Carlsbad to hear the celebrated pianist Ignaz Moscheles.

===University===
August Schumann died in 1826; his widow was less enthusiastic about a musical career for her son and persuaded him to study for the law as a profession. After his final examinations at the Lyceum in March 1828 he entered Leipzig University. Accounts differ about his diligence as a law student. According to his roommate , he never set foot in a lecture hall, but he himself recorded, &quot;I am industrious and regular, and enjoy my jurisprudence ... and am only now beginning to appreciate its true worth&quot;. Nonetheless reading and playing the piano occupied a good deal of his time, and he developed expensive tastes for champagne and cigars. Musically, he discovered the works of Franz Schubert, whose death in November 1828 caused Schumann to cry all night. The leading piano teacher in Leipzig was Friedrich Wieck, who recognised Schumann&#x27;s talent and accepted him as a pupil.

After a year in Leipzig Schumann convinced his mother that he should move to the University of Heidelberg which, unlike Leipzig, offered courses in Roman, ecclesiastical and international law (as well as reuniting Schumann with his close friend Eduard Röller who was a student there). After matriculating at the university on 30 July 1829 he travelled in Switzerland and Italy from late August to late October. He was greatly taken with Rossini&#x27;s operas and the of the soprano Giuditta Pasta; he wrote to Wieck, &quot;one can have no notion of Italian music without hearing it under Italian skies&quot;. Another influence on him was hearing the violin virtuoso Niccolò Paganini play in Frankfurt in April 1830. In the words of one biographer, &quot;The easy-going discipline at Heidelberg University helped the world to lose a bad lawyer and to gain a great musician&quot;. Finally deciding in favour of music rather than the law as a career, he wrote to his mother on 30 July 1830 telling her how he saw his future: &quot;My entire life has been a twenty-year struggle between poetry and prose, or call it music and law&quot;. He persuaded her to ask Wieck for an objective assessment of his musical potential. Wieck&#x27;s verdict was that with the necessary hard work Schumann could become a leading pianist within three years. A six-month trial period was agreed.

===1830s===

Later in 1830 Schumann published his Op. 1, a set of piano variations on a theme based on the name of its supposed dedicatee, Countess Pauline von Abegg (who was almost certainly a product of Schumann&#x27;s imagination). The notes A-B♭-E-G-G (A-B-E-G-G in German nomenclature, which uses &quot;B&quot; for the note known elsewhere as B♭ and &quot;H&quot; for the note known elsewhere as B[♮]), played in waltz tempo, make up the theme on which the variations are based. The use of a musical cryptogram became a recurrent characteristic of Schumann&#x27;s later music. In 1831 he began lessons in harmony and counterpoint with Heinrich Dorn, musical director of the Saxon court theatre, and in 1832 he published his Op. 2, (Butterflies) for piano, a programmatic piece depicting twin brothers – one a poetic dreamer, the other a worldly realist – both in love with the same woman at a masked ball. Schumann had by now come to regard himself as having two distinct sides to his personality and art: he dubbed his introspective, pensive self &quot;Eusebius&quot; and the impetuous and dynamic alter ego &quot;Florestan&quot;. Reviewing an early work of Chopin in 1831 he wrote:


Schumann&#x27;s pianistic ambitions were ended by a growing paralysis in at least one finger of his right hand. The early symptoms had come while he was still a student at Heidelberg, and the cause is uncertain. He tried all the treatments then in vogue including allopathy, homeopathy, and electric therapy, but without success. The condition had the advantage of exempting him from compulsory military service – he could not fire a rifle – but by 1832 he recognised that a career as a virtuoso pianist was impossible and he shifted his main focus to composition. He completed further sets of small piano pieces and the first movement of a symphony (it was too thinly orchestrated according to Wieck and was never completed). An additional activity was journalism. From March 1834, along with Wieck and others, he was on the editorial board of a new music magazine, (New Leipzig Music Magazine), which was reconstituted under his sole editorship in January 1835 as the . Hall writes that it took &quot;a thoughtful and progressive line on the new music of the day&quot;. Among the contributors were friends and colleagues of Schumann, writing under pen names: he included them in his (League of David) – a band of fighters for musical truth, named after the Biblical hero who fought against the – a product of the composer&#x27;s imagination in which, blurring the boundaries of imagination and reality, he included his musical friends.

During successive months in 1835 Schumann met three musicians whom he regarded with particular respect: Felix Mendelssohn, Chopin and Moscheles. Of these, he was most influenced in his compositions by Mendelssohn, although the latter&#x27;s restrained classicism is reflected in Schumann&#x27;s later works rather than in those of the 1830s. Early in 1835 he completed two substantial compositions: &quot;Carnaval&quot;, Op. 9 and the Symphonic Studies, Op.13. These works grew out of his romantic relationship with Ernestine von Fricken, a fellow pupil of Wieck. The musical themes of &quot;Carnaval&quot; derive from the name of her home town, Asch. The Symphonic Studies are based on a melody said to be by Ernestine&#x27;s father, Baron von Fricken, an amateur flautist. Schumann and Ernestine became secretly engaged, but in the view of the musical scholar Joan Chissell, during 1835 Schumann gradually found that Ernestine&#x27;s personality was not as interesting to him as he first thought, and this, together with his discovery that she was an illegitimate, impecunious, adopted daughter of Fricken, brought the affair to a gradual end. According to the biographer Alan Walker, Ernestine may have been less than frank with Schumann about her background and he was hurt when he learnt the truth.
Schumann felt a growing attraction to Wieck&#x27;s daughter, the sixteen-year-old Clara. She was her father&#x27;s star pupil, a piano virtuoso emotionally mature beyond her years, with a developing reputation. According to Chissell, her concerto debut at the Leipzig Gewandhaus on 9 November 1835, with Mendelssohn conducting, &quot;set the seal on all her earlier successes, and there was now no doubting that a great future lay before her as a pianist&quot;. Schumann had watched her career approvingly since she was nine, but only now fell in love with her. His feelings were reciprocated: they declared their love to each other in January 1836. Schumann expected that Wieck would welcome the proposed marriage, but he was mistaken: Wieck refused his consent, fearing that Schumann would be unable to provide for his daughter, that she would have to abandon her career, and that she would be legally required to relinquish her inheritance to her husband. It took a series of acrimonious legal actions over the next four years for Schumann to obtain a court ruling that he and Clara were free to marry without her father&#x27;s consent.

Professionally the later years of the 1830s were marked by an unsuccessful attempt by Schumann to establish himself in Vienna, and a growing friendship with Mendelssohn, who was by then based in Leipzig, conducting the Gewandhaus Orchestra. During this period Schumann wrote many piano works, including &quot;Kreisleriana&quot; (1837), &quot;Davidsbündlertänze&quot; (1837), (Scenes from Childhood, 1838) and (Carnival Prank from Vienna, 1839). In 1838 Schumann visited Schubert&#x27;s brother Ferdinand and discovered several manuscripts including that of the Great C major Symphony. Ferdinand allowed him to take a copy away and Schumann arranged for the work&#x27;s premiere, conducted by Mendelssohn in Leipzig on 21 March 1839. In the Schumann wrote enthusiastically about the work and described its &quot;&quot; – its &quot;heavenly length&quot; – a phrase that has become common currency in later analyses of the symphony.

Schumann and Clara finally married on 12 September 1840, the day before her twenty-first birthday. Hall writes that marriage gave Schumann &quot;the emotional and domestic stability on which his subsequent achievements were founded&quot;. Clara made some sacrifices in marrying Schumann: as a pianist of international reputation she was the better-known of the two but her career was continually interrupted by motherhood of their seven children. She inspired Schumann in his composing career, encouraging him to extend his range as a composer beyond solo piano works.

===1840s===
During 1840 Schumann turned his attention to song, producing more than half his total output of , including the cycles (&quot;Myrtles&quot;, a wedding present for Clara), (&quot;Woman&#x27;s Love and Life&quot;), (&quot;Poet&#x27;s Love&quot;), and settings of words by Joseph von Eichendorff, Heinrich Heine and others.

In 1841 Schumann focused on orchestral music. On 31 March his First Symphony, &quot;The Spring&quot;, was premiered by Mendelssohn at a concert in the Gewandhaus at which Clara played Chopin&#x27;s Second Piano Concerto and some of Schumann&#x27;s works for solo piano. His next orchestral works were the Overture, Scherzo and Finale, the Phantasie for piano and orchestra (which later became the first movement of the Piano Concerto) and a new symphony (eventually published as the Fourth, in D minor). 

Clara gave birth to a daughter in September 1841, the first of the Schumanns&#x27; seven children to survive. 
In 1842 Schumann turned his attention to chamber music. He studied works by Haydn and Mozart, despite an ambivalent attitude to the former, writing: &quot;Today it is impossible to learn anything new from him. He is like a familiar friend of the house whom all greet with pleasure and with esteem, but who has ceased to arouse any particular interest&quot;. He was stronger in his praise of Mozart: &quot;Serenity, repose, grace, the characteristics of the antique works of art, are also those of Mozart&#x27;s school. The Greeks gave to &#x27;The Thunderer&#x27; a radiant expression, and radiantly does Mozart launch his lightnings&quot;. After his studies Schumann produced three string quartets, a Piano Quintet (premiered in 1843) and a Piano Quartet (premiered in 1844).

In early 1843 there was a setback to Schumann&#x27;s career: he had a severe and debilitating mental crisis. This was not the first such attack, although it was the worst so far. Hall writes that he had been subject to similar attacks at intervals over a long period, and comments that the condition may have been congenital, affecting August Schumann and Emilie, the composer&#x27;s sister. Later in the year, Schumann, having recovered, completed a successful secular oratorio, (Paradise and the Peri), based on an oriental poem by Thomas Moore. It was premiered at the Gewandhaus on 4 December and repeat performances followed at Dresden on 23 December, Berlin early the following year, and London in June 1856, when Schumann&#x27;s friend William Sterndale Bennett conducted a performance given by the Philharmonic Society before Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort. Although neglected after Schumann&#x27;s death it remained popular throughout his lifetime and brought his name to international attention. During 1843 Mendelssohn invited him to teach piano and composition at the new Leipzig Conservatory, and Wieck approached him with an offer of reconciliation. Schumann gladly accepted both, although the resumed relationship with his father-in-law remained polite rather than close.
Clara embarked on a concert tour of Russia In 1844 ; her husband joined her. They met the leading figures of the Russian musical scene, including Mikhail Glinka and Anton Rubinstein and were both immensely impressed by Saint Petersburg and Moscow. The tour was an artistic and financial success but it was arduous, and by the end Schumann was in a poor state both physically and mentally. After the couple returned to Leipzig in late May he sold the &quot;Neue Zeitschrift&quot;, and in December the family moved to Dresden. Schumann had been passed over for the conductorship of the Leipzig Gewandhaus in succession to Mendelssohn, and he thought that Dresden, with a thriving opera house, might be the place where he could, as he now wished, become an operatic composer. His health remained poor. His doctor in Dresden reported complaints &quot;from insomnia, general weakness, auditory disturbances, tremors, and chills in the feet, to a whole range of phobias&quot;.

From the beginning of 1845 Schumann&#x27;s health began to improve; he and Clara studied counterpoint together and both produced contrapuntal works for the piano. He added a slow movement and finale to the 1841 Phantasie for piano and orchestra, to create his Piano Concerto, Op. 54. The following year he worked on what was to be published as his Second Symphony, Op. 61. Progress on the work was slow, interrupted by further bouts of ill health. When the symphony was complete he began work on his opera, &quot;Genoveva&quot;, which was not completed until August 1848.

Between 24 November 1846 and 4 February 1847 the Schumanns toured to Vienna, Berlin and other cities. The Viennese leg of the tour was not a success. The performance of Schumann&#x27;s First Symphony and Piano Concerto at the on 1 January 1847 attracted a sparse and unenthusiastic audience, but in Berlin the performance of &quot;Das Paradies und die Peri&quot; was well received, and the tour gave Schumann the chance to see numerous operatic productions. In the words of &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, &quot;A regular if not always approving member of the audience at performances of works by Donizetti, Rossini, Meyerbeer, Halévy and Flotow, he registered his &#x27;desire to write operas&#x27; in his travel diary&quot;. The Schumanns suffered several blows during 1847, including the death of their first son, Emil, born the year before, and the deaths of their friends Felix and Fanny Mendelssohn. A second son, Ludwig, and a third, Ferdinand, were born in 1848 and 1849.

===1850s===

&quot;Genoveva&quot;, a four-act opera based on the medieval legend of Genevieve of Brabant, was premiered in Leipzig, conducted by the composer, in June 1850. There were two further performances immediately afterwards, but the piece was not the success Schumann had been hoping for. In a 2005 study of the composer, Eric Frederick Jensen attributes this to Schumann&#x27;s operatic style: &quot;not tuneful and simplistic enough for the majority, not &#x27;progressive&#x27; enough for the Wagnerians&quot;. Franz Liszt, who was in the first-night audience, revived &quot;Genoveva&quot; at Weimar in 1855 – the only other production of the opera in Schumann&#x27;s lifetime. Since then, according to &quot;Kobbé&#x27;s Opera Book&quot;, despite occasional revivals &quot;Genoveva&quot; has remained &quot;far from even the edge of the repertory&quot;.

With a large family to support, Schumann sought financial security and with the support of his wife he accepted a post as director of music at Düsseldorf in April 1850. Hall comments that in retrospect it can be seen that Schumann was fundamentally unsuited for the post. In Hall&#x27;s view, Schumann&#x27;s diffidence in social situations, allied to mental instability, &quot;ensured that initially warm relations with local musicians gradually deteriorated to the point where his removal became a necessity in 1853&quot;. During 1850 Schumann composed two substantial late works – the Third (&quot;Rhenish&quot;) Symphony and the Cello Concerto. He continued to compose prolifically, and reworked some of his earlier works, including the D minor symphony from 1841, published as his Fourth Symphony (1851), and the 1835 &quot;Symphonic Studies&quot; (1852).

In 1853 the twenty-year-old Johannes Brahms called on Schumann with a letter of introduction from a mutual friend, the violinist Joseph Joachim. Brahms had recently written the first of his three piano sonatas, and played it to Schumann, who rushed excitedly out of the room and came back leading his wife by the hand, saying &quot;Now, my dear Clara, you will hear such music as you never heard before; and you, young man, play the work from the beginning&quot;. Schumann was so impressed that he wrote an article – his last – for the titled &quot;&quot; (New Paths), extolling Brahms as a musician who was destined &quot;to give expression to his times in ideal fashion&quot;.

Hall writes that Brahms proved &quot;a personal tower of strength to Clara during the difficult days ahead&quot;: in early 1854 Schumann&#x27;s health deteriorated drastically. On 27 February he attempted suicide by throwing himself into the River Rhine. He was rescued by fishermen, and at his own request he was admitted to a private sanatorium at Endenich, near Bonn, on 4 March. He remained there for more than two years, gradually deteriorating, with intermittent intervals of lucidity during which he wrote and received letters and sometimes essayed some composition. The director of the sanatorium held that direct contact between patients and relatives was likely to distress all concerned and reduce the chances of recovery. Friends, including Brahms and Joachim, were permitted to visit Schumann but Clara did not see her husband until nearly two and a half years into his confinement, and only two days before his death. Schumann died at the sanatorium aged 46 on 29 July 1856, the cause of death being recorded as pneumonia.

==Works==
&quot;Baker&#x27;s Biographical Dictionary of Musicians&quot; (2001) begins its entry on Schumann: &quot;[G]reat German composer of surpassing imaginative power whose music expressed the deepest spirit of the Romantic era&quot;, and concludes: &quot;As both man and musician, Schumann is recognized as the quintessential artist of the Romantic period in German music. He was a master of lyric expression and dramatic power, perhaps best revealed in his outstanding piano music and songs ...&quot; Schumann believed the aesthetics of all the arts were identical. In his music he aimed at a conception of art in which the poetic was the main element. According to the musicologist Carl Dahlhaus, for Schumann, &quot;music was supposed to turn into a tone poem, to rise above the realm of the trivial, of tonal mechanics, by means of its spirituality and soulfulness&quot;.

In the late nineteenth century and most of the twentieth it was widely held that the music of Schumann&#x27;s later years was less inspired than his earlier works (up to about the mid-1840s), either because of his declining health, or because his increasingly orthodox approach to composition deprived his music of the Romantic spontaneity of the earlier works. The late-nineteenth century composer Felix Draeseke commented &quot;Schumann started as a genius and ended as a talent&quot;. In the view of the composer and oboeist Heinz Holliger, &quot;certain works of his early and middle period are praised to the skies, while on the other hand a pious veil of silence obscures the more sober, austere and concentrated works of the late period&quot;. More recently the later works have been viewed more favourably; Hall suggests that this is because they are now played more often in concert and in recording studios, and have &quot;the beneficial effects of period performance practice as it has come to be applied to mid-19th-century music&quot;.

===Solo piano===

Schumann&#x27;s works in some other musical genres – particularly orchestral and operatic works – have had a mixed critical reception, both during his lifetime and since, but there is widespread agreement about the high quality of his solo piano music. In his youth the familiar Austro-German tradition of Bach, Mozart and Beethoven was temporarily eclipsed by a fashion for the flamboyant showpieces of composers such as Moscheles. Schumann&#x27;s first published work, the &quot;Abegg&quot; Variations, is in the latter style. But he revered the earlier German masters, and in his three piano sonatas (composed between 1830 and 1836) and the Fantasie in C (1836) he showed his respect for the earlier Austro-German tradition. Absolute music such as those works is in the minority in his piano compositions, of which many are what Hall calls &quot;character pieces with fanciful names&quot;.

Schumann&#x27;s most characteristic form in his piano music is the cycle of short, interrelated pieces, often programmatic, though seldom explicitly so. They include and (Wood Scenes). The critic J. A. Fuller Maitland wrote of the first of these, &quot;Of all the pianoforte works [&quot;Carnaval&quot;] is perhaps the most popular; its wonderful animation and never-ending variety ensure the production of its full effect, and its great and various difficulties make it the best possible test of a pianist&#x27;s skill and versatility&quot;. Schumann continually inserted into his piano works veiled allusions to himself and others – particularly Clara – in the form of ciphers and musical quotations. His self-references include both the impetuous &quot;Florestan&quot; and the poetic &quot;Eusebius&quot; elements he identified in himself.

Although some of his music is technically challenging for the pianist Schumann also wrote simpler pieces for young players, the best-known of which are his (Album for the Young, 1848) and Three Sonatas for Young People (1853). He also wrote some undemanding music with an eye to commercial sales, including the (Flower Piece) and (both 1839), which he privately considered &quot;feeble and intended for the ladies&quot;.

===Songs===

The authors of &quot;The Record Guide&quot; describe Schumann as &quot;one of the four supreme masters of the German &quot;, alongside Schubert, Brahms and Hugo Wolf. The pianist Gerald Moore wrote that &quot;after the unparalleled Franz Schubert&quot;, Schumann shares the second place in the hierarchy of the with Wolf. &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; classes Schumann as &quot;the true heir of Schubert&quot; in .

Schumann wrote more than 300 songs for voice and piano. They are known for the quality of the texts he set: Hall comments that the composer&#x27;s youthful appreciation of literature was constantly renewed in adult life. Although Schumann greatly admired Goethe and Schiller and set a few of their verses, his favoured poets for lyrics were the later Romantics such as Heine, Eichendorff and Mörike.

Among the best-known of the songs are those in four cycles composed in 1840 – a year Schumann called his (year of song). These are (Poet&#x27;s Love) comprising sixteen songs with words by Heine; (Woman&#x27;s Love and Life), eight songs setting poems by Adelbert von Chamisso; and two sets simply titled – German for &quot;Song Cycle&quot; – the Op. 24 set, consisting of nine Heine settings and the Op. 39 set of twelve settings of poems by Eichendorff. Also from 1840 is the set Schumann wrote as a wedding present to Clara, (Myrtles – traditionally part of a bride&#x27;s wedding bouquet), which the composer called a song cycle, although comprising twenty-six songs with lyrics from ten different writers this set is a less unified cycle than the others. In a study of Schumann&#x27;s songs Eric Sams suggests that even here there is a unifying theme, namely the composer himself. 
Although during the twentieth century it became common practice to perform these cycles as a whole, in Schumann&#x27;s time and beyond it was usual to extract individual songs for performance in recitals. The first documented public performance of a complete Schumann song cycle was not until 1861, five years after the composer&#x27;s death; the baritone Julius Stockhausen sang with Brahms at the piano. Stockhausen also gave the first complete performances of and the Op. 24 .

After his Schumann returned in earnest to writing songs after a break of several years. Hall describes the variety of the songs as immense, and comments that some of the later songs are entirely different in mood from the composer&#x27;s earlier Romantic settings. Schumann&#x27;s literary sensibilities led him to create in his songs an equal partnership between words and music unprecedented in the German . His affinity with the piano is heard in his accompaniments to his songs, notably in their preludes and postludes, the latter often summing up what has been heard in the song.

===Orchestral===

Schumann acknowledged that he found orchestration a difficult art to master, and many analysts have criticised his orchestral writing. Conductors including Gustav Mahler, Max Reger, Arturo Toscanini, Otto Klemperer and George Szell have made changes to the instrumentation before conducting his orchestral music. The music scholar Julius Harrison considers such alterations fruitless: &quot;the essence of Schumann&#x27;s warmly vibrant music resides in its forthright romantic appeal with all those personal traits, lovable characteristic and faults&quot; that make up Schumann&#x27;s artistic character. Hall comments that Schumann&#x27;s orchestration has subsequently been more highly regarded because of a trend towards playing the orchestral music with smaller forces in historically informed performance.

After the successful premiere in 1841 of the first of his four symphonies the described it as &quot;well and fluently written ... also, for the most part, knowledgeably, tastefully, and often quite successfully and effectively orchestrated&quot;, although a later critic called it &quot;inflated piano music with mainly routine orchestration&quot;. Later in the year a second symphony was premiered and was less enthusiastically received. Schumann revised it ten years later and published it as his Fourth Symphony. Brahms preferred the original, more lightly scored version, which is occasionally performed and has been recorded, but the revised 1851 score is more usually played. The work now called the Second Symphony (1846) is structurally the most classical of the four and is influenced by Beethoven and Schubert. The Third Symphony (1851), known as the &quot;Rhenish&quot;, is, unusually for a symphony of its day, in five movements, and is the composer&#x27;s nearest approach to pictorial symphonic music, with movements depicting a solemn religious ceremony in Cologne Cathedral and outdoor merrymaking of Rhinelanders.

Schumann experimented with unconventional symphonic forms in 1841 in his Overture, Scherzo and Finale, Op. 52, sometimes described as &quot;a symphony without a slow movement&quot;. Its unorthodox structure may have made it less appealing and it is not often performed. Schumann composed six overtures, three of them for theatrical performance, preceding Byron&#x27;s &quot;Manfred&quot; (1852), Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; (1853) and his own &quot;Genoveva&quot;. The other three were stand-alone concert works inspired by Schiller&#x27;s &quot;The Bride of Messina&quot;, Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Hermann and Dorothea&quot;.

The Piano Concerto (1845) quickly became and has remained one of the most popular Romantic piano concertos. In the mid-twentieth century, when the symphonies were less well regarded than they later became, the concerto was described in &quot;The Record Guide&quot; as &quot;the one large-scale work of Schumann&#x27;s which is by general consent an entire success&quot;. The pianist Susan Tomes comments, &quot;In the era of recording it has often been paired with Grieg&#x27;s Piano Concerto (also in A minor) which clearly shows the influence of Schumann&#x27;s&quot;. The first movement pitches against each other the forthright Florestan and dreamy Eusebius elements in Schumann&#x27;s artistic nature – the vigorous opening bars succeeded by the wistful A minor theme that enters in the fourth bar. No other concerto or concertante work by Schumann has approached the popularity of the Piano Concerto, but the Concert Piece for Four Horns and Orchestra (1849) and the Cello Concerto (1850) remain in the concert repertoire and are well represented on record. The late Violin Concerto (1853) is less often heard but has received several recordings.

===Chamber===
Schumann composed a substantial quantity of chamber pieces, of which the best-known and most performed are the Piano Quintet in E major, Op. 44, the Piano Quartet in the same key (both 1842) and three piano trios, the first and second from 1847 and the third from 1851. The Quintet was written for and dedicated to Clara Schumann. It is described by the musicologist Linda Correll Roesner as &quot;a very &#x27;public&#x27; and brilliant work that nonetheless manages to incorporate a private message&quot; by quoting a theme composed by Clara. Schumann&#x27;s writing for piano and string quartet – two violins, one viola and one cello – was in contrast with earlier piano quintets with different combinations of instruments, such as Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Trout Quintet&quot; (1819). Schumann&#x27;s ensemble became the template for later composers including Brahms, Franck, Fauré, Dvořák and Elgar. Roesner describes the Quartet as equally brilliant as the Quintet but also more intimate. Schumann composed a set of three string quartets (Op. 41, 1842). Dahlhaus comments that after this Schumann avoided writing for string quartet, finding Beethoven&#x27;s achievements in that genre daunting.

Among the later chamber works are the Sonata in A minor for Piano and Violin, Op. 105 – the first of three chamber pieces written in a two-month period of intense creativity in 1851 – followed by the Third Piano Trio and the Sonata in D minor for Violin and Piano, Op. 121.

In addition to his chamber works for what were or were becoming standard combinations of instruments, Schumann wrote for some unusual groupings and was often flexible about which instruments a work called for: in his Adagio and Allegro, Op. 70 the pianist may, according to the composer, be joined by either a horn, a violin or a cello, and in the , Op. 73 the pianist may be duetting with a clarinet, violin or cello. His Andante and Variations (1843) for two pianos, two cellos and a horn later became a piece for just the pianos.

===Opera and choral===
&quot;Genoveva&quot; was not a great success in Schumann&#x27;s lifetime and has continued to be a rarity in the opera house. From its premiere onwards the work was criticised on the grounds that it is &quot;an evening of and nothing much else happens&quot;. The conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt, who championed the work, blamed music critics for the low esteem in which the work is held. He maintained that they all approached the work with a preconceived idea of what an opera must be like, and finding that &quot;Genoveva&quot; did not match their preconceptions they condemned it out of hand. In Harnoncourt&#x27;s view it is a mistake to look for a dramatic plot in this opera:

Harnoncourt&#x27;s view of the lack of drama in the opera contrasts with that of Victoria Bond, who conducted the work&#x27;s first professional stage production in the US in 1987. She finds the work &quot;full of high drama and supercharged emotion. In my opinion, it&#x27;s very stageworthy, too. It’s not at all static&quot;.

Unlike the opera, Schumann&#x27;s secular oratorio was an enormous success in his lifetime, although it has since been neglected. Tchaikovsky described it as a &quot;divine work&quot; and said he &quot;knew nothing higher in all of music.&quot; The conductor Sir Simon Rattle called it &quot;The great masterpiece you&#x27;ve never heard, and there aren&#x27;t many of those now. ... In Schumann&#x27;s life it was the most popular piece he ever wrote, it was performed endlessly. Every composer loved it. Wagner wrote how jealous he was that Schumann had done it&quot;. Based on an episode from Thomas Moore&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Lalla Rookh&quot; it reflects the exotic, colourful tales from Persian mythology popular in the nineteenth century. In a letter to a friend in 1843 Schumann said, &quot;at the moment I&#x27;m involved in a large project, the largest I&#x27;ve yet undertaken – it&#x27;s not an opera – I believe it&#x27;s well-nigh a new genre for the concert hall&quot;.

 (Scenes from Goethe&#x27;s Faust), composed between 1844 and 1853, is another hybrid work, operatic in manner but written for concert performance and labelled an oratorio by the composer. The work was never given complete in Schumann&#x27;s lifetime, although the third section was successfully performed in Dresden, Leipzig and Weimar in 1849 to mark the centenary of Goethe&#x27;s birth. Jensen comments that its good reception is surprising as Schumann made no concessions to popular taste: &quot;The music is not particularly tuneful ... There are no arias for Faust or Gretchen in the grand manner&quot;. The complete work was first given in 1862 in Cologne, six years after Schumann&#x27;s death. Schumann&#x27;s other works for voice and orchestra include a Requiem Mass, described by the critic Ivan March as &quot;long-neglected and under-prized&quot;. Like Mozart before him, Schumann was haunted by the conviction that the Mass was his own requiem.

==Recordings==
All of Schumann&#x27;s major works and most of the minor ones have been recorded. From the 1920s his music has had a prominent place in the catalogues. In the 1920s Hans Pfitzner recorded the symphonies, and other early recordings were conducted by Georges Enescu and Toscanini. Large-scale performances with modern symphony orchestras have been recorded under conductors including Herbert von Karajan, Wolfgang Sawallisch and Rafael Kubelík, and from the mid-1990s smaller ensembles such as the Orchestre des Champs-Élysées with Philippe Herreweghe and the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique with John Eliot Gardiner have recorded historically informed readings of Schumann&#x27;s orchestral music.

The songs featured in the recorded repertoire from the early days of the gramophone, with performances by singers such as Elisabeth Schumann (no relation to the composer), Friedrich Schorr, Alexander Kipnis and Richard Tauber, followed in a later generation by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. Although in 1955 the authors of &quot;The Record Guide&quot; expressed regret that so few of Schumann&#x27;s songs were available on record, by the early twenty-first century every song was on disc. A complete set was published in 2010 with the songs in chronological order of composition; the pianist Graham Johnson partnered a range of singers including Ian Bostridge, Simon Keenlyside, Felicity Lott, Christopher Maltman, Ann Murray and Christine Schäfer. Pianists for other recordings of Schumann have included Gerald Moore, Dalton Baldwin, Erik Werba, Jörg Demus, Geoffrey Parsons, and more recently Roger Vignoles, Irwin Gage and Ulrich Eisenlohr.

Schumann&#x27;s solo piano music has remained core repertoire for pianists; there have been numerous recordings of major works played by performers from Sergei Rachmaninoff, Alfred Cortot, Myra Hess and Walter Gieseking to Alfred Brendel, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Martha Argerich, Stephen Hough, Arcadi Volodos and Lang Lang. The chamber works are also well represented in the recording catalogues. In 2023 &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine singled out among recent issues recordings of the Piano Quintet by Leif Ove Andsnes and the Artemis Quartet, String Quartets 1 and 3 by the Zehetmair Quartet and the Piano Trios by Andsnes, Christian Tetzlaff and Tanja Tetzlaff.

Schumann&#x27;s only opera, &quot;Genoveva&quot;, has been recorded. A 1996 complete set conducted by Harnoncourt with Ruth Ziesak in the title role followed earlier recordings under Gerd Albrecht and Kurt Masur. Recordings of include sets conducted by Gardiner and Rattle. Among the recordings of is one conducted by Benjamin Britten in 1972, with Fischer-Dieskau as Faust and Elizabeth Harwood as Gretchen.

== Legacy ==

Schumann had considerable influence in the nineteenth century and beyond. Those he influenced included French composers such as Fauré and Messager, who made a joint pilgrimage to his tomb at Bonn in 1879, Bizet, Widor, Debussy and Ravel, along with the developers of symbolism. Cortot maintained that Schumann&#x27;s inspired Bizet&#x27;s (Children&#x27;s Games, 1871), Chabrier&#x27;s (1881), Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s Corner&quot; (1908) and Ravel&#x27;s (Mother Goose, 1908).

Elsewhere in Europe, Elgar called Schumann &quot;my ideal&quot;, and Grieg&#x27;s Piano Concerto is heavily influenced by Schumann&#x27;s. Grieg wrote that Schumann&#x27;s songs deserved to be recognised as &quot;major contributions to world literature&quot;, and Schumann was a major influence on the Russian school of composers, including Anton Rubinstein and Tchaikovsky. Tchaikovsky, though critical of Schumann&#x27;s orchestration, described him as a &quot;composer of genius&quot; and &quot;the most striking exponent of the music of our time.&quot; 

Although Brahms said that all he had learned from Schumann was how to play chess, Other composers in German-speaking countries whose music shows Schumann&#x27;s influence include Mahler, Richard Strauss and Schoenberg. More recently, Schumann has been an important influence on the music of Wolfgang Rihm, who has incorporated elements of Schumann&#x27;s music into chamber works (, (Foreign Scenes, 1982–1984)) and his opera (1977–1978). Other twentieth and twenty-first century composers drawing on Schumann have included Mauricio Kagel, Wilhelm Killmayer, Henri Pousseur and Robin Holloway.

During the second half of the nineteenth century there developed what became known as the &quot;War of the Romantics&quot;. Schumann&#x27;s successors including Clara and Brahms, together with their supporters such as Joachim and the music critic Eduard Hanslick, were seen as the proponents of music in the classic German tradition of Beethoven, Mendelssohn and Schumann. They were opposed by the adherents of Liszt and Wagner, including Draeseke, Hans von Bülow (for a time) and in his capacity as a music critic Bernard Shaw, who were in favour of more extreme chromatic harmonies and explicit programmatic content. Wagner declared that the symphony was dead. By the turn of the century critics such as Fuller Maitland and Henry Krehbiel were treating the output of both factions with equal regard.

In 1991 the first volume of a complete edition of Schumann&#x27;s works was published. A supposedly complete edition had been published between 1879 and 1887, edited by Clara and Brahms, but it was not complete: apart from inadvertent omissions the two editors deliberately suppressed some of Schumann&#x27;s later music as they believed it had been affected by his declining mental health. In the 1980s the University of Cologne set up a research department with the aim of locating all the composer&#x27;s manuscripts. This led to the &quot;New Schumann Complete Edition&quot; which comprises 49 volumes and was completed in 2023.

Schumann&#x27;s birthplace in Zwickau is preserved as a museum in his honour. It hosts chamber concerts and is the focus of an annual festival commemorating him. The International Robert Schumann Competition for Piano and Voice was launched in Berlin in 1956, and later moved to Zwickau. Among the winners have been the pianists Dezső Ránki, Yves Henry and Éric Le Sage and the singers Siegfried Lorenz, Edith Wiens and Mauro Peter. In 2009 the Royal College of Music in London inaugurated the Joan Chissell Schumann Prize for singers and pianists.

In 2005 the German federal government launched the online Schumann Network in collaboration with cultural institutions in Zwickau, Leipzig, Düsseldorf and Bonn. The site aims to offer the public the most comprehensive coverage of the life and works of Robert and Clara Schumann.

<text>Franz Peter Schubert (; ; 31 January 179719 November 1828) was an Austrian composer of the late Classical and early Romantic eras. Despite his short life, Schubert left behind a vast &quot;oeuvre&quot;, including more than 600 &quot;Lieder&quot; (art songs in German) and other vocal works, seven complete symphonies, sacred music, operas, incidental music, and a large body of piano and chamber music. His major works include &quot;Erlkönig&quot;, &quot;Gretchen am Spinnrade&quot;, and &quot;Ave Maria&quot;; the &quot;Trout&quot; Quintet; the Symphony No. 8 in B minor (&quot;Unfinished&quot;); the Symphony No. 9 in C major (&quot;Great&quot;); the String Quartet No. 14 in D minor (&quot;Death and the Maiden&quot;); the String Quintet in C major; the Impromptus for solo piano; the last three piano sonatas; the Fantasia in F minor for piano four hands; the opera &quot;Fierrabras&quot;; the incidental music to the play &quot;Rosamunde&quot;; and the song cycles &quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot;, &quot;Winterreise&quot; and &quot;Schwanengesang&quot;.

Born in the Himmelpfortgrund suburb of Vienna, Schubert showed uncommon gifts for music from an early age. His father gave him his first violin lessons and his elder brother gave him piano lessons, but Schubert soon exceeded their abilities. In 1808, at the age of eleven, he became a pupil at the Stadtkonvikt school, where he became acquainted with the orchestral music of Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Ludwig van Beethoven. He left the Stadtkonvikt at the end of 1813 and returned home to live with his father, where he began studying to become a schoolteacher. Despite this, he continued his studies in composition with Antonio Salieri and still composed prolifically. In 1821, Schubert was admitted to the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde as a performing member, which helped establish his name among the Viennese citizenry. He gave a concert of his works to critical acclaim in March 1828, the only time he did so in his career. He died eight months later at the age of 31, the cause officially attributed to typhoid fever, but believed by some historians to be syphilis.

Appreciation of Schubert&#x27;s music while he was alive was limited to a relatively small circle of admirers in Vienna, but interest in his work increased greatly in the decades following his death. Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt, Johannes Brahms and other 19th-century composers discovered and championed his works. Today, Schubert is considered one of the greatest composers in the history of Western classical music and his music continues to be widely performed.

==Life and career==
===Early life and education===
Franz Peter Schubert was born in Himmelpfortgrund (now a part of Alsergrund), Vienna, Archduchy of Austria, on 31 January 1797, and baptized in the Catholic Church the following day. He was the twelfth child of Franz Theodor Florian Schubert (1763–1830) and Maria Elisabeth Katharina Vietz (1756–1812). Schubert&#x27;s immediate ancestors came originally from the province of Zuckmantel in Austrian Silesia. His father, the son of a Moravian peasant, was a well-known parish schoolmaster, and his school in Lichtental (in Vienna&#x27;s ninth district) had numerous students in attendance. He came to Vienna from Zuckmantel in 1784 and was appointed schoolmaster two years later. His mother was the daughter of a Silesian master locksmith and had been a housemaid for a Viennese family before marriage. Of Franz Theodor and Elisabeth&#x27;s fourteen children (one of them illegitimate, born in 1783), nine died in infancy.
At the age of five, Schubert began to receive regular lessons from his father, and a year later he was enrolled at his father&#x27;s school. Although it is not known exactly when he received his first musical instruction, he was given piano lessons by his brother Ignaz, but they lasted for a very short time as Schubert excelled him within a few months. Ignaz later recalled:
His father gave him his first violin lessons when he was eight years old, training him to the point where he could play easy duets proficiently. Soon after, Schubert was given his first lessons outside the family by Michael Holzer, organist and choirmaster of the local parish church in Lichtental. Holzer would often assure Schubert&#x27;s father, with tears in his eyes, that he had never had such a pupil as Schubert, and the lessons may have largely consisted of conversations and expressions of admiration. Holzer gave the young Schubert instruction in piano and organ as well as in figured bass. According to Holzer, however, he did not give him any real instruction as Schubert would already know anything that he tried to teach him; rather, he looked upon Schubert with &quot;astonishment and silence&quot;. The boy seemed to gain more from an acquaintance with a friendly apprentice joiner who took him to a neighbouring pianoforte warehouse where Schubert could practise on better instruments. He also played viola in the family string quartet, with his brothers Ferdinand and Ignaz on first and second violin and his father on the cello. Schubert wrote his earliest string quartets for this ensemble.

Young Schubert first came to the attention of Antonio Salieri, then Vienna&#x27;s leading musical authority, in 1804, when his vocal talent was recognized. In November 1808, he became a pupil at the Stadtkonvikt (Imperial Seminary) through a choir scholarship. At the Stadtkonvikt, he was introduced to the overtures and symphonies of Mozart, the symphonies of Joseph Haydn and his younger brother Michael Haydn, and the overtures and symphonies of Beethoven, a composer for whom he developed admiration. His exposure to these and other works, combined with occasional visits to the opera, laid the foundation for a broader musical education. One important musical influence came from the songs by Johann Rudolf Zumsteeg, an important composer of Lieder. The precocious young student &quot;wanted to modernize&quot; Zumsteeg&#x27;s songs, as reported by Joseph von Spaun, Schubert&#x27;s friend. Schubert&#x27;s friendship with Spaun began at the Stadtkonvikt and lasted throughout his short life. In those early days, the financially well-off Spaun furnished the impoverished Schubert with much of his manuscript paper.

In the meantime, Schubert&#x27;s talent began to show in his compositions; Salieri decided to start training him privately in music theory and composition. According to Ferdinand, the boy&#x27;s first composition for piano was a Fantasy for four hands; his first song, &quot;Klagegesang der Hagar&quot;, was written a year later. Schubert was occasionally permitted to lead the Stadtkonvikt&#x27;s orchestra, the first orchestra he wrote for. He devoted much of the rest of his time at the Stadtkonvikt to composing chamber music, several songs, piano pieces and, more ambitiously, liturgical choral works in the form of a &quot;Salve Regina&quot; (D 27), a &quot;Kyrie&quot; (D 31), in addition to the unfinished &quot;Octet for Winds&quot; (D 72, said to commemorate the 1812 death of his mother), the cantata &quot;Wer ist groß?&quot; for male voices and orchestra (D 110, for his father&#x27;s birthday in 1813), and his first symphony (D 82).

===Teacher at his father&#x27;s school===

At the end of 1813, Schubert left the Stadtkonvikt and returned home for teacher training at the St Anna Normal-hauptschule. In 1814, he entered his father&#x27;s school as the teacher of the youngest pupils. For over two years, young Schubert endured severe drudgery. However, he found compensatory interests during this time. For example, Schubert continued to take private lessons in composition from Salieri, who provided him with more technical training than any of his other teachers, until they parted ways in 1817.

In 1814, Schubert met a young soprano named Therese Grob, daughter of a local silk manufacturer, and wrote several of his liturgical works (including a &quot;Salve Regina&quot; and a &quot;Tantum Ergo&quot;) for her; she was also a soloist in the premiere of his Mass No. 1 (D. 105) in September 1814. Schubert wanted to marry her, but was hindered by the harsh marriage-consent law of 1815 requiring an aspiring bridegroom to show he had the means to support a family. In November 1816, after failing to gain a musical post in Laibach (now Ljubljana, Slovenia), Schubert sent Ms. Grob&#x27;s brother Heinrich a collection of songs, which was retained by the family into the twentieth century.

One of Schubert&#x27;s most prolific years was 1815. He composed over 20,000 bars of music, more than half of which were for orchestra, including nine church works, a symphony, and about 140 Lieder. In that year, he was also introduced to Anselm Hüttenbrenner and Franz von Schober, who would become his lifelong friends. Another friend, Johann Mayrhofer, was introduced to him by Spaun in 1815.

Throughout 1815, Schubert lived at home with his father. He continued to teach at the school and give private musical instruction, earning enough money for his basic needs, including clothing, manuscript paper, pens, and ink, but with little to no money left over for luxuries. Spaun was well aware that Schubert was discontented with his life at the schoolhouse, and was concerned for Schubert&#x27;s development intellectually and musically. In May 1816, Spaun moved from his apartment in Landskrongasse (in the inner city) to a new home in the Landstraße suburb; one of the first things he did after he settled into the new home was to invite Schubert to spend a few days with him. This was probably Schubert&#x27;s first visit away from home or school. Schubert&#x27;s unhappiness during his years as a schoolteacher possibly showed early signs of depression, and it is virtually certain that Schubert suffered from cyclothymia throughout his life.

In 1989, the musicologist Maynard Solomon suggested that Schubert was erotically attracted to men, a thesis that has been heatedly debated. The musicologist and Schubert expert Rita Steblin has said that he was &quot;chasing women&quot;. The theory of Schubert&#x27;s sexuality or &quot;Schubert as Other&quot; has continued to influence current scholarship. Biographer Lorraine Byrne Bodley is sceptical &quot;...of Solomon’s &quot;outing&quot; of Schubert, saying this misunderstands the passionate &quot;homosocial&quot; friendships of 19th-century Europe.&quot;

===Support from friends===

Significant changes occurred in Schubert&#x27;s life in 1816 when Schober, a student from an affluent family, invited him to lodge at his mother&#x27;s house. The proposal was particularly opportune, for Schubert had just made the unsuccessful application for the post of Kapellmeister at Laibach, and he had also decided not to resume teaching duties at his father&#x27;s school. By the end of the year, he became a guest in Schober&#x27;s lodgings. For a time, he attempted to increase the household resources by giving music lessons, but they were soon abandoned, and he devoted himself to composition. &quot;I compose every morning, and when one piece is done, I begin another.&quot; During this year, he focused on orchestral and choral works, although he also continued to write Lieder. Much of this work was unpublished, but manuscripts and copies circulated among friends and admirers.

In early 1817, Schober introduced Schubert to Johann Michael Vogl, a prominent baritone twenty years Schubert&#x27;s senior. Vogl, for whom Schubert went on to write a great many songs, became one of Schubert&#x27;s main proponents in Viennese musical circles. Schubert also met Joseph Hüttenbrenner (brother of Anselm), who also played a role in promoting his music. These, and an increasing circle of friends and musicians, became responsible for promoting, collecting, and, after his death, preserving his work. Heinrich Anschütz wrote in his memoirs that Schubert was an active member of the 1817–1818 Unsinnsgesellschaft (Nonsenses Society), and various scholars agree with this.

In late 1817, Schubert&#x27;s father gained a new position at a school in Rossau, not far from Lichtental. Schubert rejoined his father and reluctantly took up teaching duties there. In early 1818, he applied for membership in the prestigious Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, intending to gain admission as an accompanist, but also so that his music, especially the songs, could be performed in the evening concerts. He was rejected on the basis that he was &quot;no amateur&quot;, although he had been employed as a schoolteacher at the time and there were professional musicians already among the society&#x27;s membership. However, he began to gain more notice in the press, and the first public performance of a secular work, an overture performed in February 1818, received praise from the press in Vienna and abroad.

Schubert spent the summer of 1818 as a music teacher to the family of Count Johann Karl Esterházy at their château in Zselíz (now Želiezovce, Slovakia). The pay was relatively good, and his duties teaching piano and singing to the two daughters, Marie and Caroline, were relatively light, allowing him to compose happily. Schubert may have written his Marches Militaire in D major (D. 733 no. 1) for Marie and Caroline, in addition to other piano duets. On his return from Zselíz, he took up residence with his friend Mayrhofer.
During the early 1820s, Schubert was part of a close-knit circle of artists and students who had social gatherings together that became known as &quot;Schubertiads.&quot; Many of them took place in Ignaz von Sonnleithner&#x27;s large apartment in the Gundelhof (Brandstätte 5, Vienna). The tight circle of friends with which Schubert surrounded himself was dealt a blow in early 1820. Schubert and four of his friends were arrested by the Austrian police who, in the aftermath of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars, were on their guard against revolutionary activities and suspicious of any gathering of youth or students. One of Schubert&#x27;s friends, Johann Senn, was put on trial, imprisoned for over a year, and then permanently forbidden to enter Vienna. The other four, including Schubert, were &quot;severely reprimanded&quot;, in part for &quot;inveighing against [officials] with insulting and opprobrious language&quot;. While Schubert never saw Senn again, he did set some of his poems, &quot;Selige Welt&quot; (D. 743) and &quot;Schwanengesang&quot; (D 744), to music. The incident may have played a role in a falling-out with Mayrhofer, with whom he was living at the time.

Schubert, who was only a little more than five feet tall, was nicknamed &quot;Schwammerl&quot; by his friends, which Gibbs describes as translating to &quot;Tubby&quot; or &quot;Little Mushroom&quot;. &quot;Schwamm&quot; is &quot;mushroom&quot; in the Austrian and Bavarian dialects of German; the ending &quot;-erl&quot; makes it a diminutive. Gibbs also claims he may have occasionally drunk to excess, noting that references to Schubert&#x27;s heavy drinking &quot;... come not only in later accounts, but also in documents dating from his lifetime.&quot;

===Musical maturity===
Schubert&#x27;s compositions of 1819 and 1820 show a marked advance in development and maturity of style. He began the ultimately unfinished oratorio &quot;Lazarus&quot; (D. 689) in February 1820. This was later followed by the hymn &quot;Der 23. Psalm&quot; (D. 706), the octet &quot;Gesang der Geister über den Wassern&quot; (D. 714), the Quartettsatz in C minor (D. 703), the &quot;Wanderer Fantasy&quot; in C major for piano (D. 760), and additional smaller works. In 1820, two of Schubert&#x27;s operas were staged: &quot;Die Zwillingsbrüder&quot; (D. 647) appeared at the Theater am Kärntnertor on 14 June, and &quot;Die Zauberharfe&quot; (D. 644) appeared at the Theater an der Wien on 21 August. Hitherto, his larger compositions (apart from his masses) had been restricted to the amateur orchestra at the Gundelhof (Brandstätte 5, Vienna), a society which grew out of the quartet-parties at his home. Now he began to assume a more prominent position, addressing a wider public. Publishers, however, remained distant, with Anton Diabelli hesitantly agreeing to print some of his works on commission. The first seven opus numbers, all songs, appeared on these terms; then the commission ceased, and he began to receive parsimonious royalties. The situation improved somewhat in March 1821 when Vogl performed the song &quot;Erlkönig&quot; (D. 328) at a concert that was extremely well received. That month, Schubert composed a Variation on a Waltz by Diabelli (D 718), being one of the fifty composers who contributed to the &quot;Vaterländischer Künstlerverein&quot; publication.

The production of the two operas turned Schubert&#x27;s attention more firmly than ever in the direction of the stage, where, for a variety of reasons, he was almost completely unsuccessful. All in all, he embarked on twenty stage projects, each of them failures that were quickly forgotten. In 1822, &quot;Alfonso und Estrella&quot; was rejected, partly owing to its libretto, written by Schubert&#x27;s friend Franz von Schober. In 1823, &quot;Fierrabras&quot; (D 796) was rejected: Domenico Barbaia, impresario for the court theatres, largely lost interest in new German opera due to the popularity of Rossini and the Italian operatic style, and the failure of Carl Maria von Weber&#x27;s &quot;Euryanthe&quot;. &quot;Die Verschworenen&quot; (&quot;The Conspirators&quot;, D 787) was prohibited by the censor, apparently because of its title, and the play &quot;Rosamunde, Fürstin von Zypern&quot;, for which Schubert had written incidental music (D 797), was withdrawn after two nights, due to the play&#x27;s poor quality.

Despite his operatic failures, Schubert&#x27;s reputation was growing steadily on other fronts. In 1821, the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde finally accepted him as a performing member, and the number of performances of his music grew remarkably. These performances helped Schubert&#x27;s reputation grow rapidly among the members of the Gesellschaft and established his name. Some of the members of the Gesellschaft, most notably Ignaz von Sonnleithner and his son Leopold von Sonnleithner, had a sizeable influence on the affairs of the society, and as a result of that and of Schubert&#x27;s growing reputation, his works were included in three major concerts of the Gesellschaft in 1821. In April, one of his male-voice quartets was performed, and in November, his Overture in E minor (D. 648) received its first public performance; at a different concert on the same day as the premiere of the Overture, his song &quot;Der Wanderer&quot; (D. 489) was performed.

In 1822, Schubert made the acquaintance of both Weber and Beethoven but little came of it in either case; however, Beethoven is said to have acknowledged the younger man&#x27;s gifts on a few occasions. On his deathbed, Beethoven is said to have looked into some of the younger man&#x27;s works and exclaimed: &quot;Truly, the spark of divine genius resides in this Schubert!&quot; Beethoven also reportedly predicted that Schubert &quot;would make a great sensation in the world,&quot; and regretted that he had not been more familiar with him earlier; he wished to see his operas and works for piano, but his severe illness prevented him from doing so.

===Last years and masterworks===
Despite his preoccupation with the stage and subsequent official duties, Schubert wrote a significant amount of music during these years. He completed the Mass in A-flat major, (D. 678) in 1822, and later that year embarked suddenly on a work which, more decisively than almost any other in those years, showed his maturing personal vision, the Symphony in B minor, known as the &quot;Unfinished&quot; Symphony (D. 759). The reason he left it unfinished – after writing two movements and sketches some way into a third – continues to be discussed and written about, and it is also remarkable that he did not mention it to any of his friends, even though, as Brian Newbould notes, he must have felt thrilled by what he was achieving.
In 1823, Schubert wrote his first large-scale song cycle, &quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot; (D. 795), setting poems by Wilhelm Müller. This series, together with the later cycle &quot;Winterreise&quot; (D. 911, also setting texts of Müller in 1827) is widely considered one of the pinnacles of Lieder. He also composed the song &quot;Du bist die Ruh&#x27;&quot; (&quot;You are rest and peace&quot;, D. 776) during this year. Also in that year, symptoms of syphilis first appeared.

In 1824, he composed the Variations in E minor for flute and piano; &quot;Trockne Blumen&quot;, a song from the cycle &quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot;; and several string quartets. He also wrote the Sonata in A minor for arpeggione and piano (D. 821) at the time when there was a minor craze over that instrument. In the spring of that year, he wrote the Octet in F major (D. 803), a sketch for a &quot;Grand Symphony,&quot; and in the summer went back to &quot;Zseliz&quot;. There he became attracted to Hungarian musical idiom and wrote the &quot;Divertissement à la hongroise&quot; in G minor for piano duet (D. 818) and the String Quartet in A minor &quot;Rosamunde&quot; (D. 804). It has been said that he held a hopeless passion for his pupil, the Countess Caroline Esterházy, but the only work that bears a dedication to her is his Fantasia in F minor for piano duet (D. 940). This dedication, however, can only be found in the first edition and not in Schubert&#x27;s autograph. His friend Eduard von Bauernfeld penned the following verse, which appears to reference Schubert&#x27;s unrequited sentiments:
&lt;poem&gt;
In love with a Countess of youthful grace,
—A pupil of Galt&#x27;s; in desperate case
Young Schubert surrenders himself to another,
And fain would avoid such affectionate pother&lt;/poem&gt;

The setbacks of previous years were compensated by the prosperity and happiness of 1825. Publication had been moving more rapidly, the stress of poverty was for a time lightened, and in the summer he had a pleasant holiday in Upper Austria where he was welcomed with enthusiasm. It was during this tour that he produced the seven-song cycle &quot;Fräulein am See&quot;, based on Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot;, and including &quot;Ellens Gesang III&quot; (&quot;Hymn to the Virgin&quot;) (D. 839, Op. 52, No. 6); the lyrics of Adam Storck&#x27;s German translation of the Scott poem are now frequently replaced by the full text of the traditional Roman Catholic prayer Hail Mary (&quot;Ave Maria&quot; in Latin), but for which the Schubert melody is not an original setting. The original only opens with the greeting &quot;Ave Maria&quot;, which also recurs only in the refrain. In 1825, Schubert also wrote the Piano Sonata in A minor (D 845, first published as op. 42), and began the Symphony in C major (&quot;Great C major&quot;, D. 944), which was completed the following year.
From 1826 to 1828, Schubert resided continuously in Vienna, except for a brief visit to Graz, Austria, in 1827. In 1826, he dedicated a symphony (D. 944, that later came to be known as the &quot;Great C major&quot;) to the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde and received an honorarium in return. The String Quartet No. 14 in D minor (D. 810), with the variations on &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot;, was written during the winter of 1825–1826, and first played on 25 January 1826. Later in the year came the String Quartet No. 15 in G major, (D 887, first published as op. 161), the &quot;Rondo in B minor for violin and piano&quot; (D. 895), &quot;Rondeau brillant&quot;, and the Piano Sonata in G major, (D 894, first published as &quot;Fantasie in G&quot;, op. 78). He also produced in 1826 three Shakespearian songs, of which &quot; (D. 889) and &quot; (D. 891) were allegedly written on the same day, the former at a tavern where he broke his afternoon&#x27;s walk, the latter on his return to his lodging in the evening.

The works of his last two years reveal a composer entering a new professional and compositional stage. Although parts of Schubert&#x27;s personality were influenced by his friends, he nurtured an intensely personal dimension in solitude; it was out of this dimension that he wrote his greatest music. The death of Beethoven affected Schubert deeply, and may have motivated Schubert to reach new artistic peaks. In 1827, Schubert wrote the song cycle &quot;Winterreise&quot; (D. 911), the Fantasy in C major for violin and piano (D. 934, first published as op. post. 159), the Impromptus for piano, and the two piano trios (the first in B-flat major (D. 898), and the second in E-flat major, (D. 929); in 1828 the cantata &quot;Mirjams Siegesgesang&quot; (&quot;Victory Song of Miriam&quot;, D 942) on a text by Franz Grillparzer, the Mass in E-flat major (D. 950), the &quot;Tantum Ergo&quot; (D. 962) in the same key, the String Quintet in C major (D. 956), the second &quot;Benedictus&quot; to the Mass in C major (D. 961), the three final piano sonatas (D. 958, D. 959, and D. 960), and the collection &quot;13 Lieder nach Gedichten von Rellstab und Heine&quot; for voice and piano, also known as &quot;Schwanengesang&quot; (&quot;Swan-song&quot;, D. 957). (This collection – which includes settings of words by Heinrich Heine, Ludwig Rellstab, and Johann Gabriel Seidl – is not a true song cycle like &quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot; or &quot;Winterreise&quot;.) The &quot;Great C major&quot; symphony is dated 1828, but Schubert scholars believe that this symphony was largely written in 1825–1826 (being referred to while he was on holiday at Gastein in 1825—that work, once considered lost, is now generally seen as an early stage of his C major symphony) and was revised for prospective performance in 1828. The orchestra of the Gesellschaft reportedly read through the symphony at a rehearsal, but never scheduled a public performance of it. The reasons continue to be unknown, although the difficulty of the symphony is a possible explanation. In the last weeks of his life, he began to sketch three movements for a new Symphony in D major (D 936A); In this work, he anticipates Mahler&#x27;s use of folksong-like harmonics and bare soundscapes. Schubert expressed the wish, were he to survive his final illness, to further develop his knowledge of harmony and counterpoint, and had actually made appointments for lessons with the counterpoint master Simon Sechter.

On 26 March 1828, the anniversary of Beethoven&#x27;s death, Schubert gave, for the only time in his career, a public concert of his own works. The concert was a success popularly and financially, although it was overshadowed by Niccolò Paganini&#x27;s first appearances in Vienna shortly after.

===Final illness and death===

In the midst of this creative activity, his health deteriorated. By the late 1820s, Schubert&#x27;s health was failing and he confided to some friends that he feared that he was near death. In the late summer of 1828, he saw the physician Ernst Rinna, who may have confirmed Schubert&#x27;s suspicions that he was ill beyond cure and likely to die soon. Some of his symptoms matched those of mercury poisoning (mercury was then a common treatment for syphilis, again suggesting that Schubert suffered from it). At the beginning of November, he again fell ill, experiencing headaches, fever, swollen joints, and vomiting. He was generally unable to retain solid food and his condition worsened. Five days before Schubert&#x27;s death, his friend the violinist Karl Holz and his string quartet visited to play for him. The last musical work he had wished to hear was Beethoven&#x27;s String Quartet No. 14 in C-sharp minor, Op. 131; Holz commented: &quot;The King of Harmony has sent the King of Song a friendly bidding to the crossing&quot;.

Schubert died in Vienna, aged 31, on 19 November 1828, at the apartment of his brother Ferdinand. The cause of his death was officially diagnosed as typhoid fever, though other theories have been proposed, including the tertiary stage of syphilis. Although there are accounts by his friends that indirectly imply that he had contracted syphilis earlier, the symptoms of his final illness do not correspond with tertiary syphilis. Six weeks before his death, he walked 68 km (42 miles) in three days, ruling out musculoskeletal syphilis. In the months before his death, he composed his last work, &quot;Der Hirt auf dem Felsen&quot;, making neurosyphilis unlikely. Meningovascular syphilis is also unlikely because it presents a progressive stroke-like picture, and Schubert had no neurological manifestation until his final delirium, which started only two days before his death. 
Lastly, his final illness was characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms (namely vomiting). These issues all led Robert L. Rold to argue that (although he believed Schubert had syphilis), the fatal final illness was a gastrointestinal one such as salmonella or indeed typhoid fever. Rold also pointed out that when Schubert was in his final illness, his close friend Schober avoided visiting him &quot;out of fear of contagion&quot;. Yet Schober had known of his earlier possible syphilis and had never avoided Schubert in the past. Eva M. Cybulska goes further and says that Schubert&#x27;s syphilis is a conjecture. His multi-system signs and symptoms, she says, could point at a number of different illness such as leukaemia, anaemia, or Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis, and that many tell-tale signs of syphilis — chancre, mucous plaques, rash on the thorax, pupil abnormality, dysgraphia — were absent. She argues that the syphilis diagnosis originated with Schubert&#x27;s biographer Otto Deutsch in 1907, based on the aforementioned indirect references by his friends, and uncritically repeated ever since.

Schubert was buried, at his own request, near the grave of Beethoven, whom he had admired all his life, in the village cemetery of Währing on the edge of the Vienna Woods. A year earlier he had served as a torchbearer at Beethoven&#x27;s funeral.
In 1872, a memorial to Franz Schubert was erected in Vienna&#x27;s Stadtpark. In 1888, both Schubert&#x27;s and Beethoven&#x27;s graves were moved to the Zentralfriedhof where they are next to the later graves of Johann Strauss II and Johannes Brahms. Anton Bruckner was present at both exhumations, and he reached into both coffins and held the revered skulls in his hands. The cemetery in Währing was converted into a park in 1925, called the Schubert Park, and his former grave site was marked by a bust. His epitaph, written by his friend, the poet Franz Grillparzer, reads: &quot;Die Tonkunst begrub hier einen reichen Besitz, aber noch viel schönere Hoffnungen&quot; (&quot;The art of music has here interred a precious treasure, but yet far fairer hopes&quot;).

==Music==

Schubert was remarkably prolific, writing over 1,500 works in his short career. His compositional style progressed rapidly throughout his life. The largest number of his compositions are songs for solo voice and piano (roughly 630). Schubert also composed a considerable number of secular works for two or more voices, namely part songs, choruses and cantatas. He completed eight orchestral overtures and seven complete symphonies, in addition to fragments of six others. While he composed no concertos, he did write three concertante works for violin and orchestra. Schubert wrote a large body of music for solo piano, including eleven incontrovertibly completed sonatas and at least eleven more in varying states of completion, numerous miscellaneous works and many short dances, in addition to producing a large set of works for piano four hands. He also wrote over fifty chamber works, including some fragmentary works. Schubert&#x27;s sacred output includes seven masses, one oratorio and one requiem, among other mass movements and numerous smaller compositions. He completed only eleven of his twenty stage works.

===Style===
In July 1947 the Austrian composer Ernst Krenek discussed Schubert&#x27;s style, abashedly admitting that he had at first &quot;shared the wide-spread opinion that Schubert was a lucky inventor of pleasing tunes ... lacking the dramatic power and searching intelligence which distinguished such &#x27;real&#x27; masters as J. S. Bach or Beethoven&quot;. Krenek wrote that he reached a completely different assessment after a close study of Schubert&#x27;s pieces at the urging of his friend and fellow composer Eduard Erdmann. Krenek pointed to the piano sonatas as giving &quot;ample evidence that [Schubert] was much more than an easy-going tune-smith who did not know, and did not care, about the craft of composition.&quot; Each sonata then in print, according to Krenek, exhibited &quot;a great wealth of technical finesse&quot; and revealed Schubert as &quot;far from satisfied with pouring his charming ideas into conventional moulds; on the contrary he was a thinking artist with a keen appetite for experimentation.&quot;

====Instrumental music, stage works and church music====
That &quot;appetite for experimentation&quot; manifests itself repeatedly in Schubert&#x27;s output in a wide variety of forms and genres, including opera, liturgical music, chamber and solo piano music, and symphonic works. Perhaps most familiarly, his adventurousness is reflected in his notably original sense of modulation; for example, the second movement of the String Quintet (D. 956), which is in E major, features a central section in the distant key of F minor. It also appears in unusual choices of instrumentation, as in the Sonata in A minor for arpeggione and piano (D. 821), or the unconventional scoring of the &quot;Trout Quintet&quot; (D. 667) for piano, violin, viola, cello, and double bass, whereas conventional piano quintets are scored for piano and string quartet.
Although Schubert was clearly influenced by the Classical sonata forms of Beethoven, Haydn and Mozart, his formal structures and his developments tend to give the impression more of melodic development than of harmonic drama. This combination of Classical form and long-breathed Romantic melody sometimes lends them a discursive style: his &quot;Great C Major Symphony&quot; was described by Robert Schumann as running to &quot;heavenly lengths&quot;.

====Lieder and art songs====

It was in the genre of the lied that Schubert made his most indelible mark. Leon Plantinga remarks that &quot;in his more than six hundred Lieder he explored and expanded the potentialities of the genre, as no composer before him.&quot; Prior to Schubert&#x27;s influence, Lieder tended toward a strophic, syllabic treatment of text, evoking the folksong qualities engendered by the stirrings of Romantic nationalism.

Among Schubert&#x27;s treatments of the poetry of Goethe, his settings of &quot;Gretchen am Spinnrade&quot; (D. 118) and &quot;Der Erlkönig&quot; (D. 328) are particularly striking for their dramatic content, forward-looking uses of harmony, and use of eloquent pictorial keyboard figurations, such as the depiction of the spinning wheel and treadle in the piano in &quot;Gretchen&quot; and the furious and ceaseless gallop in &quot;&quot;. He composed music using the poems of myriad poets, with Goethe, Mayrhofer, and Schiller the most frequent, and others, including Heinrich Heine, Friedrich Rückert, and Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff.
Of particular note are his two song cycles on the poems of Wilhelm Müller, &quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot; and &quot;Winterreise&quot;, which helped to establish the genre and its potential for musical, poetic, and almost operatic dramatic narrative. His last collection of songs, published in 1828 after his death, &quot;Schwanengesang&quot;, is also an innovative contribution to German Lieder literature, as it features poems by different poets, namely Ludwig Rellstab, Heine, and Johann Gabriel Seidl. The &quot;Wiener Theaterzeitung&quot;, writing about &quot;Winterreise&quot; at the time, commented that it was a work that &quot;none can sing or hear without being deeply moved&quot;.

Antonín Dvořák wrote in 1894 that Schubert, whom he considered one of the truly great composers, was clearly influential on shorter works, especially Lieder and shorter piano works: &quot;The tendency of the romantic school has been toward short forms, and although Weber helped to show the way, to Schubert belongs the chief credit of originating the short models of piano forte pieces which the romantic school has preferably cultivated... Schubert created a new epoch with the Lied... All other songwriters have followed in his footsteps.&quot;

===Publication – catalogue===

When Schubert died he had around 100 opus numbers published, mainly songs, chamber music and smaller piano compositions. Publication of smaller pieces continued (including opus numbers up to 173 in the 1860s, 50 instalments with songs published by Diabelli and dozens of first publications Peters), but the manuscripts of many of the longer works, whose existence was not widely known, remained hidden in cabinets and file boxes of Schubert&#x27;s family, friends, and publishers. Even some of Schubert&#x27;s friends were unaware of the full scope of what he wrote, and for many years he was primarily recognized as the &quot;prince of song&quot;, although there was recognition of some of his larger-scale efforts. In 1838 Robert Schumann, on a visit to Vienna, found the dusty manuscript of the C major Symphony (D. 944) and took it back to Leipzig where it was performed by Felix Mendelssohn and celebrated in the &quot;Neue Zeitschrift.&quot; An important step towards the recovery of the neglected works was the journey to Vienna which the music historian George Grove and the composer Arthur Sullivan made in October 1867. The travellers unearthed the manuscripts of six of the symphonies, parts of the incidental music to &quot;Rosamunde&quot;, the Mass No. 1 in F major (D. 105), and the operas &quot;Des Teufels Lustschloss&quot; (D. 84), &quot;Fernardo&quot; (D. 220), &quot;Der vierjährige Posten&quot; (D. 190), and &quot;Die Freunde von Salamanka&quot; (D. 326), and several other unnamed works. With these discoveries, Grove and Sullivan were able to inform the public of the existence of these works; in addition, they were able to copy the fourth and sixth symphonies, the &quot;Rosamunde&quot; incidental music, and the overture to &quot;Die Freunde von Salamanka&quot;. This led to more widespread public interest in Schubert&#x27;s work.

====Complete editions====
From 1884 to 1897, Breitkopf &amp; Härtel published Franz Schubert&#x27;s Works, a critical edition including a contribution made – among others – by Johannes Brahms, editor of the first series containing eight symphonies. The publication of the Neue Schubert-Ausgabe by Bärenreiter started in the second half of the 20th century.

====Deutsch catalogue====

Since relatively few of Schubert&#x27;s works were published in his lifetime, only a small number of them have opus numbers assigned, and even in those cases, the sequence of the numbers does not give a good indication of the order of composition. Austrian musicologist Otto Erich Deutsch (1883–1967) is known for compiling the first comprehensive catalogue of Schubert&#x27;s works. This was first published in English in 1951 (&quot;Schubert Thematic Catalogue&quot;) and subsequently revised for a new edition in German in 1978 (&quot;Franz Schubert: Thematisches Verzeichnis seiner Werke in chronologischer Folge&quot; – Franz Schubert: Thematic Catalogue of his Works in Chronological Order).

====Numbering issues====

Confusion arose quite early over the numbering of Schubert&#x27;s late symphonies. Schubert&#x27;s last completed symphony, the &quot;Great C major&quot; , was assigned the numbers 7, 8, 9 and 10, depending on publication. Similarly the &quot;Unfinished&quot; has been indicated with the numbers 7, 8, and 9.

The order usually followed for these late symphonies by English-language sources is:
*No. 7: E major, D 729
*No. 8: B minor, D 759 &quot;Unfinished&quot;
*No. 9: C major, D 944 &quot;Great C major&quot;
*No. 10: D major, D 936A

An even broader confusion arose over the numbering of the piano sonatas, with numbering systems ranging from 15 to 23 sonatas.

===Instruments===
Among pianos Schubert had access to were a Benignus Seidner piano (now displayed at the Schubert Geburtshaus in Vienna) and an Anton Walter &amp; Sohn piano (today in the collection of the Vienna Kunsthistorisches Museum). Schubert was also familiar with instruments by Viennese piano builder Conrad Graf. He appreciated the potential these early nineteenth-century instruments possessed for both intimate and extrovert, virtuosic playing.

==Recognition==
A feeling of regret for the loss of potential masterpieces caused by Schubert&#x27;s early death at age 31 was expressed in the epitaph on his large tombstone written by Grillparzer: &quot;Here music has buried a treasure, but even fairer hopes.&quot; Some prominent musicians share a similar view, including the pianist Radu Lupu, who said: &quot;[Schubert] is the composer for whom I am really most sorry that he died so young. ... Just before he died, when he wrote his beautiful two-cello String Quintet in C, he said very modestly that he was trying to learn a little more about counterpoint, and he was perfectly right. We&#x27;ll never know in what direction he was going or would have gone.&quot; However, others have expressed disagreement with this early view. For instance, Robert Schumann said: &quot;It is pointless to guess at what more [Schubert] might have achieved. He did enough; and let them be honoured who have striven and accomplished as he did&quot;, and the pianist András Schiff said that: &quot;Schubert lived a very short life, but it was a very concentrated life. In 31 years, he lived more than other people would live in 100 years, and it is needless to speculate what could he have written had he lived another 50 years. It&#x27;s irrelevant, just like with Mozart: these are the two natural geniuses of music.&quot;

The Wiener Schubertbund, one of Vienna&#x27;s leading choral societies, was founded in 1863, whilst the Gründerzeit was taking place. The Schubertbund quickly became a rallying point for schoolteachers and other members of the Viennese middle class who felt increasingly embattled during the Gründerzeit and the aftermath of the Panic of 1873. In 1872, the dedication of the Schubert Denkmal, a gift to the city from Vienna&#x27;s leading male chorus, the Wiener Männergesang-Verein, took place; the chorus performed at the event. The Denkmal was designed by Austrian sculptor Carl Kundmann and is located in Vienna&#x27;s Stadtpark.

Schubert&#x27;s chamber music continues to be popular. In a survey conducted by the ABC Classic FM radio station in 2008, Schubert&#x27;s chamber works dominated the field, with the &quot;Trout Quintet&quot; ranked first, the String Quintet in C major ranked second, and the Notturno in E-flat major for piano trio ranked third. Furthermore, eight more of his chamber works were among the 100 ranked pieces: both piano trios, the String Quartet No. 14 (&quot;Death and the Maiden&quot;), the String Quartet No. 15, the Arpeggione Sonata, the Octet, the Fantasie in F minor for piano four-hands, and the &quot;Adagio and Rondo Concertante&quot; for piano quartet.

&quot;The New York Times&quot;″ chief music critic Anthony Tommasini, who ranked Schubert as the fourth greatest composer, wrote of him:You have to love the guy, who died at 31, ill, impoverished and neglected except by a circle of friends who were in awe of his genius. For his hundreds of songs alone – including the haunting cycle &quot;Winterreise&quot;, which will never release its tenacious hold on singers and audiences – Schubert is central to our concert life... Schubert&#x27;s first few symphonies may be works in progress. But the &quot;Unfinished&quot; and especially the &quot;Great C major&quot; Symphony are astonishing. The latter one paves the way for Bruckner and prefigures Mahler.

===Tributes by other musicians===
From the 1830s through the 1870s, Franz Liszt transcribed and arranged several of Schubert&#x27;s works, particularly the songs. Liszt, who was a significant force in spreading Schubert&#x27;s work after his death, said Schubert was &quot;the most poetic musician who ever lived.&quot; Schubert&#x27;s symphonies were of particular interest to Antonín Dvořák. Hector Berlioz and Anton Bruckner acknowledged the influence of the &quot;Great C Major&quot; Symphony. Robert Schumann, after seeing the manuscript of the symphony in Vienna in 1838, brought it to the attention of Mendelssohn. Mendelssohn then conducted the first performance of the symphony, albeit in a heavily abridged version, in Leipzig in 1839.

In the 20th century, composers including Richard Strauss, Anton Webern, Benjamin Britten, George Crumb, and Hans Zender championed or paid homage to Schubert in some of their works. Britten, an accomplished pianist, accompanied many of Schubert&#x27;s Lieder and performed many piano solo and duet works. German electronic music group Kraftwerk has a track titled &quot;Franz Schubert&quot; on their 1977 album &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot;.

===Commemorations===
In 1897, the 100th anniversary of Schubert&#x27;s birth was marked in the musical world by festivals and performances dedicated to his music. In Vienna, there were ten days of concerts, and Emperor Franz Joseph gave a speech recognising Schubert as the creator of the art song, and one of Austria&#x27;s favourite sons.
Karlsruhe saw the first production of his opera &quot;Fierrabras&quot;.

In 1928, Schubert Week was held in Europe and the United States to mark the centenary of the composer&#x27;s death. Works by Schubert were performed in churches, in concert halls, and on radio stations. A competition, with top prize money of US$10,000 and sponsorship by the Columbia Phonograph Company, was held for &quot;original symphonic works presented as an apotheosis of the lyrical genius of Schubert, and dedicated to his memory&quot;. The winning entry was Kurt Atterberg&#x27;s sixth symphony.

===In film and television===
Schubert has featured as a character in several films including &quot;Schubert&#x27;s Dream of Spring&quot; (1931), &quot;Gently My Songs Entreat&quot; (1933), &quot;Serenade&quot; (1940), &quot;The Great Awakening&quot; (1941)—whose plot is based on a fictional episode of him fleeing Vienna to Hungary to avoid conscription—It&#x27;s Only Love (1947), &quot;Franz Schubert&quot; (1953), &quot;Das Dreimäderlhaus&quot; (1958), and &quot;Mit meinen heißen Tränen&quot; (1986). 

Schubert&#x27;s life was covered in the documentary &quot;Franz Peter Schubert: The Greatest Love and the Greatest Sorrow&quot; by Christopher Nupen (1994), and in the documentary &quot;Schubert – The Wanderer&quot; by András Schiff and Mischa Scorer (1997), both produced for the BBC. &quot;Great Performances,&quot; &quot;Now Hear This: The Schubert Generation Series,&quot; hosted by Scott Yoo, explored commentary and performances by contemporary musician admirers.

Schubert&#x27;s music has also been featured in numerous films: 
* The Walt Disney film &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940) features Ave Maria (D. 839). 
* The Robert Bresson film &quot;Au hasard Balthazar&quot; (1966) features the Piano Sonata No. 20 in A Major (D. 959).
* The Stanley Kubrick film &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; (1975) features the second movement from the Piano Trio No. 2 in E-Flat Major, Op. 100/D.929.
* The English version of &quot;The Adventures of Milo and Otis&quot; (1989) features Serenade and Auf dem Wasser zu singen (D. 774).
* The Woody Allen film &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; (1989) prominently features String Quartet No. 15 in G.
* The Roman Polanski film &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; (1994) features and takes its name from the music of the String Quartet No. 14 in D minor, &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot;.
* The biographical film &quot;Carrington&quot; (1995) features the second movement of the String Quintet in C major (D. 956).
* The Guy Ritchie film &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot; (2011) features the Piano Quintet in A major, D. 667 (&quot;Trout Quintet&quot;).

<text>The Aeolian Islands ( ; ; ), sometimes referred to as the Lipari Islands or Lipari group ( , ) after their largest island, are a volcanic archipelago in the Tyrrhenian Sea north of Sicily, said to be named after Aeolus, the mythical ruler of the winds. The islands&#x27; inhabitants are known as Aeolians (). The islands had a permanent population of 14,224 at the 2011 census; the latest official estimate is 15,419 as of 1 January 2019. The Aeolian Islands are a popular tourist destination in the summer and attract up to 600,000 visitors annually.

There are seven significant islands: Lipari, Vulcano, Salina, Stromboli, Filicudi, Alicudi and Panarea, and a set of minor islands and rocks.

==Geography==
The Aeolian Islands are off the north coast of Sicily in the Tyrrhenian Sea. Vulcano is located closest to the Sicilian coast. Lipari and Salina follow to the north, Filicudi and Alicudi to the west, and Panarea and Stromboli to the northeast. In addition to these seven inhabited islands, there are a number of smaller, uninhabited islands and rocky cliffs, such as Basiluzzo, Strombolicchio, and .

The largest island is Lipari (), followed by Salina (), Vulcano (), Stromboli (), Filicudi () and Alicudi (). The smallest island, at , is Panarea. The highest elevation of the Lipari Islands is on Salina, which reaches a height of .

==Geology==

The seven Aeolian Islands, covering an area of , originated in the Tyrrhenian Basin, a great plain at the bottom of the Tyrrhenian Sea. Emissions of lava from depths of up to resulted in the formation of the Aeolian Islands, together with Ustica and a series of submarine volcanoes named Magnani, Vavilov, Marsili and Palinuro, as well as two that are unnamed.

The present shape of the Aeolian Islands is the result of volcanic activity over a period of 260,000 years. There are two active volcanoes – Stromboli and Vulcano. Steaming fumaroles and thermal waters are on most of the islands. The volcanic activity has also left the islands with a very fertile soil that is beneficial in the growth of natural flora.

Geologically the archipelago is defined as a volcanic arc. The origin of the Aeolian Islands is due to movement of the Earth&#x27;s crust as a result of plate tectonics. The African continental shelf is in constant movement towards Europe. Its subduction underneath the Eurasian plate generates magma, which rises to the surface to form the volcanoes. The &quot;Aeolian Arc&quot; extends for more than . It is a section of a larger area of geological instability across the Mediterranean region, caused by the collision of Africa and Europe, which includes Sicily, Calabria, and Campania together with Greece and the Aegean islands.


==Administration==
The islands form part of the Sicilian Metropolitan City of Messina. All the islands except Salina comprise the commune of Lipari within that province; Salina forms three separate communes: Malfa, Leni and Santa Marina Salina.
==Architectural control==

Curbing urban development has been a key in preserving the Aeolian islands in a natural state. New buildings are severely restricted. Existing residences can be bought and restored but they must be constructed to resemble its whitewashed houses. Traditional houses consist of modular cubes constructed from indigenous building materials like stone, lava, pumice, and tufo. Almost all houses have a huge outdoor terrace, usually shaded by grape and flowering vines.

==Mythology==
In Homer&#x27;s epic poem, the Odyssey, Aeolus, son of Hippotes, was the divine keeper of the winds and king of the mythical, floating island of Aeolia. He kept the violent winds locked safely away inside the interior of his isle, releasing them only at the command of greatest gods to wreak devastation upon the world.

The hero of the epic poem, Odysseus, on his travels to return home from Troy, visited Aiolos&#x27; isle and was entrusted with a bag containing all of the winds to ensure a safe voyage home. However, during the trip, the hero&#x27;s companions opened the bag and the escaping winds carried their ship all the way back to Aiolos&#x27; shore.

==History==
===4000–2500 BC===
The first evidence of Sicilian migration was in Lipari (). The manufacture and commerce of obsidian objects was highly developed until the introduction of metals.

===1600–1250 BC===
During the Bronze Age, the Aeolians prospered by means of maritime commerce in an area which extended from Mycenae to the British Isles, from where tin was imported. Villages on the Aeolian islands flourished on Capo Graziano (Filicudi), Castello (Lipari), Serro dei Cianfi (Salina), Capo Milazzese (Panarea), and Portella (Salina). All these settlements were destroyed by new Italic invasions in 1250 BC.

===1240–850 BC===
According to Diodorus Siculus, the Aeolian Islands were occupied by the Ausones led by Liparus. Liparus was succeeded by Aeolus whose house, according to the &quot;Odyssey&quot; by Homer, gave hospitality to Odysseus.

===600–300 BC===
In 580 BC, Greeks exiled from Rhodes and Knidos landed at Lipari and began a period of Greek domination, which was known for acts of piracy against Etruscan and Phoenician shipping. There was production of vases and other ceramics.

===300 BC–AD 250===

The islanders were allies of the Carthaginians against Rome during the Punic Wars. Although the Battle of the Lipari Islands in 260 BC led to a Carthaginian victory, the Romans later sacked Lipari and their domination led to a period of poverty.

===AD 250–1000===
At the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Aeolian Islands came under the sway of the Visigoths, the Vandals and the Ostrogoths, followed by the domination of the Byzantine Empire. According to a Christian legend, in 264 a coffin which contained the body of Bartholomew washed up on the beach of Lipari, with the result that Bartholomew was immediately elected the patron saint of the Aeolian Islands. In 836 the Aghlabids of Ziyadat Allah I of Ifriqiya sacked Lipari, massacred most of the population, enslaved the survivors and annexed the Liparian Islands into the Emirate of Sicily.

===1000–1600===
The Norman conquest of Sicily from the Emirate of Sicily in 1061 resulted in the annexation of the islands. Roger II of Sicily sent the Benedictine monks to Lipari, which gave rise to considerable development on the islands. A cathedral dedicated to Saint Bartholomew was built, as well as the Benedictine monastery in the castle. In 1208 Frederick II of Swabia acceded to the throne of the Kingdom of Sicily. The period of prosperity which followed, ended with the domination of the Angevins and the rebellion of the Sicilians which culminated in the revolt of the Sicilian Vespers. The Aeolians however, remained loyal to Charles of Anjou, and commercial links were established with Naples, the capital of the Angevin kingdom. In 1337 Lipari opened its gates to the French fleet without resistance, and in return obtained various commercial and fiscal benefits. In the mid-15th century, Naples and Palermo united into the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies under the crown of Alfonso V of Aragon.
On June 30, 1544, a fleet of 180 Ottoman vessels under the command of the corsair Hayreddin Barbarossa occupied Lipari and laid siege to the castle. The defenders surrendered. Historically, it is said around 9,000 of the 10,000 citizens of Lipari were captured and enslaved although a couple of more recent scholars have questioned this number arguing for a lower population at the time of Barbarossa. A number of citizens were ransomed in Messina and returned to the islands but most of those captured never returned. Only after the tragedy did the Spanish authorities turn their attention to Lipari and repopulate the city with Sicilian, Calabrian and Spanish families. The city walls and houses were rebuilt and an Aeolian fleet was constructed which was able to successfully defend the Tyrrhenian Sea from the Ottomans.

===1600–present===
In 1693, an earthquake destroyed all the towns in eastern Sicily, causing around 60,000 deaths. After the population invoked the protection of Saint Bartholomew during prayers in the cathedral, there was not a single victim on the Aeolian Islands. The economic conditions of the islands improved greatly during the 17th century with agricultural progress (malvasia grapes), capers, and a variety of fruit, vegetables and fishing). With the Bourbons came the introduction of criminal and political prisoners to the islands. In 1916, the penal colony was closed, but the Fascist regime unsuccessfully tried to reopen it in 1926. The island population reacted by pulling down the remains of the ex-penitentiary in the castle. However, not long after, the castle was converted to accommodate anti-Fascist political prisoners in enforced exile. Liparians fraternised with these exiles until the Allies&#x27; liberation. After the war, the same room that had housed the opponents of Fascism became the .

Towards the end of the 19th century, the Aeolian Islands were visited by Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria—a friend of the islands and also a man with a profound knowledge of the archipelago. Between the years 1893–96 he published a work of eight volumes on the Aeolian Islands.

In August 1888, the crater named Fossa on Vulcano erupted and caused many deaths in the sulphur mines. The eruptions continued for 19 months.

On New Year&#x27;s Day in 1909, a rumour appeared in international newspapers that the Aeolian Islands had been &quot;swallowed up by the sea&quot; during a time of volcanic activity. While communication with the islands was interrupted for a time, they were not otherwise inconvenienced.

During World War II, all of the Aeolian Islands were captured by the Allies in August 1943, during the invasion of Sicily. The islands were then extensively searched by archeologists Madeleine Cavalier and Luigi Bernabò Brea after World War II.

==UNESCO World Heritage Sites==
The Aeolian Islands were listed by UNESCO in 2000 as a World Heritage Site for providing &quot;an outstanding record of volcanic island-building and destruction, and ongoing volcanic phenomena&quot;. Status as a World Heritage Site was threatened by Italy&#x27;s failure to close the pumice quarry as well as its failure to prevent the building of 4 new harbours. However, , it is still listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage site.

<text>Moses Mendelssohn (6 September 1729 – 4 January 1786) was a German-Jewish philosopher and theologian. His writings and ideas on Jews and the Jewish religion and identity were a central element in the development of the &quot;Haskalah&quot;, or &#x27;Jewish Enlightenment&#x27; of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
Born to a poor Jewish family in Dessau, Principality of Anhalt, and originally destined for a rabbinical career, Mendelssohn educated himself in German thought and literature. Through his writings on philosophy and religion he came to be regarded as a leading cultural figure of his time by both Christian and Jewish inhabitants of German-speaking Europe and beyond. His involvement in the Berlin textile industry formed the foundation of his family&#x27;s wealth.

His descendants include the composers Fanny and Felix Mendelssohn; Felix&#x27;s son, chemist Paul Mendelssohn Bartholdy; Fanny&#x27;s grandsons, Paul and Kurt Hensel; and the founders of the Mendelssohn &amp; Co. banking house.

==Life==
=== Youth ===
Moses Mendelssohn was born in Dessau to and . His father&#x27;s name was Mendel, but Moses and his brother Saul were the first to adopt the surname Mendelssohn (&quot;Mendel&#x27;s son&quot;). Moses&#x27;s son Abraham Mendelssohn wrote in 1829 (to Felix), &quot;My father felt that the name Moses Ben Mendel Dessau would handicap him in gaining the needed access to those who had the better education at their disposal. Without any fear that his own father would take offense, my father assumed the name Mendelssohn. The change, though a small one, was decisive.&quot;

Mendel was an impoverished scribe—a writer of Torah scrolls—and his son Moses in his boyhood developed curvature of the spine. Moses&#x27; early education was provided by his father and by the local rabbi, David Fränkel, who, besides teaching him the Bible and Talmud, introduced to him the philosophy of Maimonides. In 1743 Fränkel received a call to Berlin, and a few months later Moses followed him. Moses, age 14, &quot;entered Berlin at the Rosenthaler Tor, the only gate in the city wall through which Jews (and cattle) were allowed to pass.&quot; &quot;Mendelssohn enrolled in Frankel&#x27;s exacting seminary, where the program consisted of unending rote repetitions of early medieval texts, interpretations thereof, elaborations of Talmudic law, and copious commentary accumulated over the centuries.&quot;

A refugee Polish Jew, Israel Zamosz, taught him mathematics, and a young Jewish physician taught him Latin. He was, however, mainly self-taught. He learned to spell and to philosophize at the same time (according to the historian Graetz). With his scanty earnings he bought a Latin copy of John Locke&#x27;s &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot;, and mastered it with the aid of a Latin dictionary. He then made the acquaintance of Aaron Solomon Gumperz, who taught him basic French and English. In 1750, a wealthy Jewish silk-merchant, Isaac Bernhard, appointed him to teach his children. Mendelssohn soon won the confidence of Bernhard, who made the young student successively his bookkeeper and his partner.

It was possibly Gumperz who introduced Mendelssohn to Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in 1754, who became one of his greatest friends. It is said that the first time Mendelssohn met Lessing, they played chess. In Lessing&#x27;s play &quot;Nathan the Wise&quot; Nathan and the character Saladin first meet during a game of chess. Lessing had recently produced the drama &quot;Die Juden&quot;, whose moral was that a Jew can possess nobility of character. This notion was, in the contemporary Berlin of Frederick the Great, generally ridiculed as untrue. Lessing found in Mendelssohn the realization of his dream. Within a few months, the two became closely intellectually allied. Lessing also brought Mendelssohn to public attention for the first time: Mendelssohn had written an essay attacking Germans&#x27; neglect of their native philosophers (principally Gottfried Leibniz), and lent the manuscript to Lessing. Without consulting the author, Lessing published Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Conversations&quot; (&quot;Philosophische Gespräche&quot;) anonymously in 1755. In the same year there appeared in Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland) an anonymous satire, &quot;Pope a Metaphysician&quot; (&quot;Pope ein Metaphysiker&quot;), which turned out to be the joint work of Lessing and Mendelssohn.

=== Early prominence as philosopher and critic ===
Mendelssohn became the leading spirit of Friedrich Nicolai&#x27;s important literary undertakings, the &quot;Bibliothek&quot; and the &quot;Literaturbriefe&quot;, and ran some risk by criticizing the poems of Frederick II, King of Prussia; Frederick’s good nature kept him out of trouble. In 1762 he married Fromet Guggenheim, who survived him by twenty-six years. In the year following his marriage Mendelssohn won the prize offered by the Berlin Academy for an essay on the application of mathematical proofs to metaphysics, &quot;On Evidence in the Metaphysical Sciences&quot;; among the competitors were Thomas Abbt and Immanuel Kant, who came second. In October 1763 the king granted Mendelssohn, but not his wife or children, the privilege of Protected Jew (&quot;Schutzjude&quot;), which assured his right to undisturbed residence in Berlin.

As a result of his correspondence with Abbt, Mendelssohn resolved to write on the immortality of the soul. Materialistic views were at the time rampant and fashionable, and faith in immortality was at a low ebb. At this favourable juncture appeared &quot;Phädon oder über die Unsterblichkeit der Seele&quot; (&quot;Phaedo or On the Immortality of Souls&quot;; 1767). Modelled on Plato&#x27;s dialogue of the same name, Mendelssohn&#x27;s work possessed some of the charm of its Greek exemplar and impressed the German world with its beauty and lucidity of style. &quot;Phaedo&quot; was an immediate success, and besides being one of the most widely read books of its time in German was speedily translated into several European languages, including English. The author was hailed as the &quot;German Plato&quot;, or the &quot;German Socrates&quot;; royal and other aristocratic friends showered attentions on him, and it was said that &quot;no stranger who came to Berlin failed to pay his personal respects to the German Socrates.&quot;

=== Lavater ===

So far, Mendelssohn had devoted his talents to philosophy and criticism; now, however, an incident turned the current of his life in the direction of the cause of Judaism. In April 1763, Johann Kaspar Lavater, then a young theology-student from Zurich, made a trip to Berlin, where he visited the already famous Jewish philosopher with some companions. They insisted on Mendelssohn telling them his views on Jesus and managed to get from him the statement, that, provided the historical Jesus had kept himself and his theology strictly within limits of orthodox Judaism, Mendelssohn &quot;respected the morality of Jesus&#x27; character.&quot; Six years later, in October 1769, Lavater sent Mendelssohn his German translation of Charles Bonnet&#x27;s essay on Christian Evidences, with a preface where he publicly challenged Mendelssohn to refute Bonnet or if he could not then to &quot;do what wisdom, the love of truth and honesty must bid him, what a Socrates would have done if he had read the book and found it unanswerable.&quot; Mendelssohn answered in an open letter in December 1769: &quot;Suppose there were living among my contemporaries a Confucius or a Solon, I could, according to the principles of my faith, love and admire the great man without falling into the ridiculous idea that I must convert a Solon or a Confucius.&quot; The ongoing public controversy cost Mendelssohn much time, energy and strength.

Lavater later described Mendelssohn in his book on physiognomy, &quot;Physiognomische Fragmente zur Beförderung der Menschenkenntnis und Menschenliebe&quot; (1775–1778), as &quot;a companionable, brilliant soul, with piercing eyes, the body of an Aesop [who was traditionally considered ugly]—a man of keen insight, exquisite taste and wide erudition [...] frank and open-hearted&quot;—ending his public praise with the wish of Mendelssohn recognizing, &quot;together with Plato and Moses... the crucified glory of Christ.&quot; When, in 1775 the Swiss-German Jews, faced with the threat of expulsion, turned to Mendelssohn and asked him to intervene on their behalf with &quot;his friend&quot; Lavater, Lavater, after receiving Mendelssohn&#x27;s letter, promptly and effectively secured their stay.

=== Illness ===
In March 1771 Mendelssohn&#x27;s health deteriorated so badly that Marcus Elieser Bloch, his doctor, decided his patient had to give up philosophy, at least temporarily. After a short and restless sleep one evening, Mendelssohn found himself incapable of moving and had the feeling of something lashing his neck with fiery rods, his heart was palpitating and he was in an extreme anxiety, yet fully conscious. This spell was then broken suddenly by some external stimulation. Attacks of this kind recurred. The cause of his disease was ascribed to the mental stress due to his theological controversy with Lavater. However, this sort of attack, in milder form, had presumably occurred many years earlier. Bloch diagnosed the disease as due to &#x27;congestion of blood in the brain&#x27; (a meaningless diagnosis in modern medical practice as such congestion is anatomically impossible), and after some controversy this diagnosis was also accepted by the famous Hanoverian court physician, Johann Georg Ritter von Zimmermann, an admirer of Mendelssohn. In retrospect, his illness might be diagnosed as a heart-rhythm-problem (such as atrial fibrillation) and/or a mild form of familial dysautonomia, a hereditary disease of Ashkenazi Jews, which often brings with it a curvature of the spine and epilepsy-like symptoms in times of stress.

Mendelssohn was treated with China bark, blood lettings on the foot, leeches applied to the ears, enemas, foot baths, lemonade and mainly vegetarian food. “No mental stress whatsoever” was ordered. However, although he remained subject to periods of setback, he eventually recovered sufficiently to write the major works of his later career.

===Death===

Mendelssohn died on 4 January 1786 as the result (it was thought at the time) of a cold contracted while carrying a manuscript (his reply to Jacobi, titled &quot;To Lessing&#x27;s Friends (An die Freunde Lessings)&quot;) to his publishers on New Year&#x27;s Eve; Jacobi was held by some to have been responsible for his death. He was buried in the Jewish Cemetery of Berlin. The translation of the Hebrew inscription on his gravestone (see picture to the right) reads: &quot;H[ere] r[ests] / the wise R[eb] Moses of Dessau / born on the 12th of Elul 5489 [6 September 1729] / died on Wednesday the 5th of Shevat [4 January] / and buried the next morning on Thursday 6th/ 5546 [5 January 1786] / M[ay] H[is] S[oul be] B[ound up in the] B[ond of eternal] L[ife]&quot;. Although the cemetery was largely destroyed during the Nazi era, after German reunification, in 2007-2008, it was reestablished with monuments to its past, including a recreation of Mendelssohn&#x27;s gravestone.

==Philosophical work==

=== Works on religion and civil society ===
It was after the breakdown of his health that Mendelssohn decided to &quot;dedicate the remains of my strength for the benefit of my children or a goodly portion of my nation&quot;—which he did by trying to bring the Jews closer to &quot;culture, from which my nation, alas! is kept in such a distance, that one might well despair of ever overcoming it&quot;. One of the means of doing this was by &quot;giving them a better translation of the holy books than they previously had&quot;. To this end Mendelssohn undertook his German translation of the Pentateuch and other parts of the Bible. This work was called the &quot;Bi&#x27;ur&quot; (&quot;the explanation&quot;) (1783) and also contained a commentary, only that on Exodus having been written by Mendelssohn himself. The translation was in an elegant High German, designed to allow Jews to learn the language faster. Most of the German Jews in that period spoke Yiddish and many were literate in Hebrew (the language of Jewish scripture, liturgy, and scholarship). The commentary was also thoroughly rabbinic, quoting mainly from medieval exegetes but also from Talmud-era &quot;midrashim&quot;. Mendelssohn is also believed to be behind the foundation of the first modern public school for Jewish boys, &quot;Freyschule für Knaben&quot;, in Berlin in 1778 by one of his most ardent pupils, David Friedländer, where both religious and worldly subjects were taught.

Mendelssohn also tried to better the Jews&#x27; situation in general by furthering their rights and acceptance. He induced Christian Wilhelm von Dohm to publish in 1781 his work, &quot;On the Civil Amelioration of the Condition of the Jews&quot;, which played a significant part in the rise of tolerance. Mendelssohn himself published a German translation of the &quot;Vindiciae Judaeorum&quot; by Menasseh Ben Israel.

The interest caused by these actions led Mendelssohn to publish his most important contribution to the problems connected with the position of Judaism in a Gentile world. This was &quot;Jerusalem&quot; (1783; Eng. trans. 1838 and 1852). It is a forcible plea for freedom of conscience, described by Kant as &quot;an irrefutable book&quot;. Mendelssohn wrote:

Brothers, if you care for true piety, let us not feign agreement, where diversity is evidently the plan and purpose of Providence. None of us thinks and feels exactly like his fellow man: why do we wish to deceive each other with delusive words?
Its basic thrust is that the state has no right to interfere with the religion of its citizens, Jews included. While it proclaims the mandatory character of Jewish law for all Jews (including, based on Mendelssohn&#x27;s understanding of the New Testament, those converted to Christianity), it does not grant the rabbinate the right to punish Jews for deviating from it. He maintained that Judaism was less a &quot;divine need, than a revealed life&quot;. &quot;Jerusalem&quot; concludes with the cry &quot;Love truth, love peace!&quot;—in a quote from Zacharias 8:19.

Kant called this &quot;the proclamation of a great reform, which, however, will be slow in manifestation and in progress, and which will affect not only your people but others as well.&quot; Mendelssohn asserted the pragmatic principle of the possible plurality of truths: that just as various nations need different constitutions—to one a monarchy, to another a republic, may be the most congenial to the national genius—so individuals may need different religions. The test of religion is its effect on conduct. This is the moral of Lessing&#x27;s &quot;Nathan the Wise&quot; (&quot;Nathan der Weise&quot;), the hero of which is undoubtedly Mendelssohn, and in which the parable of the three rings is the epitome of the pragmatic position.

To Mendelssohn his theory represented a strengthening bond to Judaism. But in the first part of the 19th century, the criticism of Jewish dogmas and traditions was associated with a firm adhesion to the older Jewish mode of living. Reason was applied to beliefs, the historic consciousness to life. Modern reform in Judaism has parted to some extent from this conception. In the view of the German writer Heinrich Heine, &quot;as Luther had overthrown the Papacy, so Mendelssohn overthrew the Talmud; and he did so after the same fashion, namely, by rejecting tradition, by declaring the Bible to be the source of religion, and by translating the most important part of it. By these means he shattered Judaic, as Luther had shattered Christian, catholicism; for the Talmud is, in fact, the catholicism of the Jews.&quot;

=== Later years and legacy ===
Mendelssohn grew ever more famous, and counted among his friends many of the great figures of his time. But his final years were overshadowed and saddened by the so-called pantheism controversy. Ever since his friend Lessing had died, he had wanted to write an essay or a book about his character. When Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, an acquaintance of both men, heard of Mendelssohn&#x27;s project, he stated that he had confidential information about Lessing being a &quot;Spinozist&quot;, which, in these years, was regarded as being more or less synonymous with &quot;atheist&quot;—something which Lessing was accused of being anyway by religious circles.

This led to an exchange of letters between Jacobi and Mendelssohn which showed they had hardly any common ground. Mendelssohn then published his &quot;Morgenstunden oder Vorlesungen über das Dasein Gottes&quot; (&quot;Morning hours or lectures about God&#x27;s existence&quot;), seemingly a series of lectures to his oldest son, his son-in-law and a young friend, usually held &quot;in the morning hours&quot;, in which he explained his personal philosophical world-view, his own understanding of Spinoza and Lessing&#x27;s &quot;purified&quot; (&quot;geläutert&quot;) pantheism. But almost simultaneously with the publication of this book in 1785, Jacobi published extracts of his and Mendelssohn&#x27;s letters as &quot;Briefe über die Lehre Spinozas&quot;, stating publicly that Lessing was a self-confessed &quot;pantheist&quot; in the sense of &quot;atheist&quot;. Mendelssohn was thus drawn into a poisonous literary controversy, and found himself attacked from all sides, including former friends or acquaintances such as Johann Gottfried von Herder and Johann Georg Hamann. Mendelssohn&#x27;s contribution to this debate, &quot;To Lessing&#x27;s Friends (An die Freunde Lessings)&quot; (1786), was his last work, completed a few days before his death.

Mendelssohn&#x27;s complete works have been published in 19 volumes (in the original languages) (Stuttgart, 1971 ff., ed. A. Altmann and others)

== Family ==
Mendelssohn had six children, of whom only his second-oldest daughter, Recha, and his eldest son, Joseph, retained the Jewish faith. His sons were: Joseph (founder of the Mendelssohn banking house and a friend and benefactor of Alexander von Humboldt), Abraham (who married Lea Salomon and was the father of Fanny and Felix Mendelssohn), and Nathan (a mechanical engineer of considerable repute). His daughters were Brendel (later Dorothea; the wife of Simon Veit and mother of Philipp Veit, subsequently the mistress, and then wife, of Friedrich von Schlegel), Recha, and Henriette, all gifted women. Recha&#x27;s only grandson (son of Heinrich Beer, brother of the composer Giacomo Meyerbeer), was born and educated as a Jew, but died very young, together with his parents, apparently from an epidemic. Joseph Mendelssohn&#x27;s son Alexander (1798-1871) was the last male descendant of Moses Mendelssohn to practice Judaism.
