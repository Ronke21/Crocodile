==Events of Go-Saga&#x27;s life==
He ruled from 21 February 1242, to 16 February 1246.

When Emperor Tsuchimikado moved to Tosa Province (on Shikoku), he was raised by his mother&#x27;s side of the family.

Because of the sudden death of Emperor Shijō at the age of 10, the question of succession arose. Because the expectations of the court nobility and the Bakufu conflicted, the issue was bitterly contested. Kujō Michiie and the court nobility supported Prince Tadanari (忠成王), a son of Retired Emperor Juntoku, but the &quot;shikken&quot; Hōjō Yasutoki was opposed to the sons of Juntoku because of his involvement in the Jōkyū War. Michiie instead supported Tsuchimikado&#x27;s son Prince Kunihito as a neutral figure for Emperor. During these negotiations, there was a vacancy on the throne of 11 days.

* 11 February 1242 (&quot;Ninji 3, 10th day of the 1st month&quot;): In the 10th year of Shijō&quot;-tennō&quot; &#x27;s reign (四条天皇10年), the emperor died suddenly; and despite a dispute over who should follow him as sovereign, contemporary scholars then construed that the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by the second son of former Emperor Tsuchimikado.
* 19 April 1242 (&quot;Ninji 3, 18th day of the 3rd month&quot;): Emperor Go-Saga is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

In 1242, Prince Kunihito became emperor. In 1246 he abdicated to his son, Emperor Go-Fukakusa, beginning his reign as cloistered emperor. In 1259, he compelled Emperor Go-Fukakusa to abdicate to his younger brother, Emperor Kameyama. Imperial Prince Munetaka became &quot;shōgun&quot; instead of the Hōjō regents. Henceforth, the &quot;shōguns&quot; of the Kamakura Bakufu came from the imperial house. Still, the Hōjō regents increased their control of the shogunate, setting up the system of rule by regents.

The descendants of his two sons contested the throne between them, forming into two lines, the Jimyōin-tō (Go-Fukakusa&#x27;s descendants) and the Daikakuji-tō (Kameyama&#x27;s descendants). Their lines would eventually lead to the split between the Northern and Southern Courts.
In 1272, Go-Saga died.

Go-Saga&#x27;s final resting place is designated as an Imperial mausoleum (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Saga no minami no &quot;Misasagi&quot; at Tenryū-ji in Kyoto.

==Kugyō==
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Go-Saga&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Konoe Kanetsune, 1242
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Nijō Yoshizane, 1242–1246
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Ichijō Sanetsune, 1246
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Nadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Go-Saga&#x27;s reign==
The years of Go-saga&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Ninji&quot; (1240–1243)
* &quot;Kangen&quot; (1243–1247)

==Political significance==
When Go-Fukakusa ascended to the throne in 1246 at the age of four, his father Go-Saga continued to rule from his position of Retired Emperor. In 1260 Go-Saga forced Go-Fukakusa to abdicate in favor of Kaneyama. Kaneyama&#x27;s son was named Crown Prince (later known as Emperor Go-Uda). Go-Fukakusa appealed to the shogunal administration in the city of Kamakura and had his own son (later known as Emperor Fushimi) named next in line after Go-Uda. During the reign of Go-Uda, Go-Fukakusa exerted power from the office of Retired Emperor. An agreement was reached by which the next emperors would alternate between descendants of Go-Fukakusa and descendants of Kameyama.

==Events of Go-Fukakusa&#x27;s life==
 formally became at the age of 2; and Go-Saga began to exercise power as cloistered Emperor.

* 16 February 1246 (&quot;Kangen 4, 29th day of the 1st month&quot;): In the 4th year of Go-Saga&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (後嵯峨天皇四年), he abdicated; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his 4-year-old son. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Go-Fukakusa is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

In 1259, at the insistence of Retired Emperor Go-Saga, he abdicated at the age of 15 to his younger brother, who would become Emperor Kameyama.

After Emperor Go-Uda&#x27;s ascension in 1260, Saionji Sanekane negotiated with the Bakufu, and succeeded in getting Emperor Go-Fukakusa&#x27;s son Hirohito named as Crown Prince. In 1287, with his ascension as Emperor Fushimi, Go-Fukakusa&#x27;s cloistered rule began.

In 1290, he entered the priesthood, retiring from the position of cloistered Emperor. But, with his seventh son, Imperial Prince Hisaaki becoming the 8th Kamakura shōgun among other things, the position of his Jimyōin-tō became strengthened.

In 1304, he died. He is enshrined with other emperors at the imperial tomb called &quot;Fukakusa no kita no misasagi&quot; (深草北陵) in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto.

<text>Bartolomeu Dias ( – 29 May 1500) was a Portuguese mariner and explorer. In 1488, he became the first European navigator to round the southern tip of Africa and to demonstrate that the most effective southward route for ships lies in the open ocean, well to the west of the African coast. His discoveries effectively established the sea route between Europe and Asia.

==Early life==
Bartolomeu Dias was born around 1450 in the Faro District of Portugal. His family had a maritime background, and one of his ancestors, Dinis Dias, explored the African coast in the 1440s and discovered the Cap-Vert peninsula in today&#x27;s Senegal in 1445. Tracing his biography is complicated by the existence of several contemporary Portuguese seafarers with the same name.

In 1481, Dias accompanied an expedition, led by Diogo de Azambuja, to construct a fortress and trading post called São Jorge da Mina in the Gulf of Guinea. 

Indirect evidence also points to his possible participation in Diogo Cão&#x27;s first expedition (1482–1484) down the African coast to the Congo River.

==Voyage around Africa==

In 1486 he seems to have been a cavalier of the king&#x27;s household and superintendent of the royal warehouses; on 10 October in that year, he received an annuity of 6000 reis from King John II of Portugal for &quot;services to come&quot;; and sometime after this (probably about July or August 1487, rather than July 1486, the traditional date) he left Lisbon with three ships to carry on the work of African exploration so significantly advanced by Diogo Cão. Dias was also charged with searching for Prester John, a legendary figure believed to be the powerful Christian ruler of a realm somewhere beyond Europe, possibly in the African interior. Dias was provided with two caravels of about 50 tons each (&quot;São Cristóvão&quot; and &quot;São Pantaleão&quot;) and a square-rigged supply ship captained by his brother Diogo. He recruited some of the leading pilots of the day, including Pero de Alenquer and João de Santiago, who had previously sailed with Cão.

No contemporary documents detailing this historic voyage have been found, as almost all maritime records were destroyed in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and ensuing tsunami. Much of the available information comes from the sixteenth-century historian João de Barros, who wrote about the voyage sixty years later.

The small fleet left Lisbon in or around July 1487. Like his predecessor, Cão, Dias carried a set of &quot;padrões&quot;, carved stone pillars to mark his progress at significant landfalls. Also on board were six Africans who had been kidnapped by Cão and taught Portuguese. Dias planned to drop them off at various points along the African coast so that they could testify to the grandeur of the Portuguese kingdom and make inquiries into the possible whereabouts of Prester John.

The expedition sailed directly to the Congo and proceeded more carefully down the African coast, often naming notable geographic features after saints honored on the Catholic Church&#x27;s calendar. When they weighed anchor at what today is Porto Alexandre, Angola, Dias left the supply ship behind so that it could re-provision them later on their return voyage. By December, Dias had passed the farthest point reached by Cão, and on 8 December 1487, he arrived at the Golfo da Conceição (modern-day Walvis Bay, Namibia). After slowly progressing along the Namibian coast, the two ships turned southwest, away from land. Historians have debated whether this happened because they were driven offshore by a storm or because they were deliberately trying to find more favorable winds. Whatever its cause, the change of course brought them success: the ships traced a broad arc around the tip of Africa and, on 4 February 1488, after 30 days on the open ocean, they reached the continent&#x27;s southern cape and entered what would later become known as Mossel Bay.

The ships continued east for a time and confirmed that the coast gradually trended to the northeast. Dias realized they had accomplished Portugal&#x27;s long-sought goal: rounding the southern cape of Africa. Dias&#x27;s expedition reached its furthest point on 12 March 1488, when it anchored at Kwaaihoek, near the mouth of the Boesmans River—where they erected the &quot;Padrão de São Gregório&quot;. By then, the crew had become restless, urging Dias to turn around. Supplies were low, and the ships were battered. Although Dias wanted to continue, the rest of the officers unanimously favored returning to Portugal, so he agreed to turn back. On their return voyage, they sailed close enough to Africa&#x27;s southwestern coast to encounter the Cape of Good Hope for the first time in May 1488. Tradition has it that Dias originally named it the Cape of Storms (&quot;Cabo das Tormentas&quot;) and that King John II later renamed it the Cape of Good Hope (&quot;Cabo da Boa Esperança&quot;) because it symbolized the opening of a sea route from west to east.

Dias erected the last of their &quot;padrões&quot; at the cape and then headed northward. They reached their supply ship in July, after nine months of absence, and found that six of that ship&#x27;s nine crew members had died in skirmishes with the natives. The vessel had become rotten with worms, so they unloaded the supplies they needed and burnt it on the beach. A few details about the remainder of the voyage are known. The ships made stops at Príncipe, the Rio do Resgate (in present-day Liberia), and the Portuguese trading post of São Jorge da Mina. Dias returned to Lisbon in December 1488 after an absence of 16 months.

The Dias expedition had explored a thousand more miles of the African coastline than previous expeditions had reached; it had rounded the southern tip of the continent, and it had demonstrated that the most effective southward ship route lay in the open ocean well to the west of the African coast-a route that generations of Portuguese sailors would follow. Despite these successes, Dias&#x27; reception at court was muted. There were no official proclamations, and, at the time, Dias received little in recognition of his accomplishments.

No record has yet been found of any adequate reward for Diaz: on the contrary, when the great Indian expedition was being prepared (for Vasco da Gama&#x27;s future leadership), Bartolomeu only superintended the building and outfit of the ships; when the fleet sailed in 1497, he only accompanied da Gama to the Cape Verde Islands, and after this was ordered to São Jorge da Mina.

==Later years and death==

Dias was later ennobled for his accomplishments. By 1494, he served as a squire in King John II&#x27;s court. He also served as superintendent of the royal warehouses from 1494 to 1497.

Following Dias&#x27;s return from his successful first voyage around Africa&#x27;s southern cape, Portugal took a decade-long break from Indian Ocean exploration. King John was beset by numerous problems, including the death of his only son, a war in Morocco, and his failing health. It was not until 1497 that another voyage was commissioned, and Dias was asked to assist. Drawing on his experience with maritime exploration, Dias contributed to the design and construction of the &quot;São Gabriel&quot; and its sister ship, the &quot;São Rafael&quot;. These were two ships that Vasco da Gama used to sail around the Cape of Good Hope and continue to India. Dias participated in the first half of da Gama&#x27;s voyage but stayed behind after reaching the Cape Verde Islands.

Two years later, he was one of the captains of the second Indian expedition, headed by Pedro Álvares Cabral. This flotilla was the first to reach Brazil, landing there on 22 April 1500 before continuing east to India. Dias perished in May 1500 when captaining a ship near the Cape of Good Hope: four ships, including Dias&#x27;s, encountered a massive storm off the cape and were lost on 29 May.

==Personal life==
Dias was married and had two sons, Simão Dias de Novais and António Dias de Novais. His grandson Paulo Dias de Novais became the first governor of Portuguese Angola and, in 1576, the founder of São Paulo de Luanda.

== Legacy==

The Portuguese government erected two navigational beacons, Dias Cross and da Gama Cross, to commemorate Dias and Vasco da Gama, who were the first modern European explorers to reach the Cape of Good Hope. When lined up, these crosses point to Whittle Rock, a large, permanently submerged shipping hazard in False Bay.

The Bartolomeu Dias Museum Complex (also spelled &quot;Bartholomeu&quot;), located at Mossel Bay, features an exhibition displaying the history of early European sea voyagers who discovered sea routes. The local history of 19th-century artifacts and 20th-century photographs are also displayed in this building. The building houses a life-size replica of the ship Bartolomeu Dias and his crew used when they landed in Mossel Bay in 1488.

<text>was the 91st emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. His reign spanned the years from 1274 through 1287.

This 13th-century sovereign was named after the 9th-century Emperor Uda and &quot;go-&quot; (後), translates literally as &quot;later&quot;; and thus, he is sometimes called the &quot;Later Emperor Uda,&quot; or in some older sources, may be identified as &quot;Emperor Uda, the second&quot; or as &quot;Emperor Uda II.&quot;

==Genealogy==
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was Yohito (世仁).

He was the second son of Emperor Kameyama. They were from the Daikaku-ji line.

==Events of Go-Uda&#x27;s life==
Yohito&quot;-shinnō&quot; became crown prince in 1268. According to the terms of the late emperor&#x27;s will (Go-Saga died in 1272), in 1274, he would become emperor upon the death or abdication of Emperor Kameyama.

* 6 March 1274 (&quot;Bun&#x27;ei 11, 26th day of the 1st month&quot;): In the 15th year of Kameyama&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (亀山天皇十五年), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his cousin.
* 4 May 1274 (&quot;Bun&#x27;ei 11, 26th day of the 3rd month&quot;): Emperor Go-Uda is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

The retired Emperor Kameyama continued to exercise power as cloistered emperor.

During his reign, the unsuccessful Mongol invasions of Japan occurred, first in 1274 and again in 1281. Though they established a beachhead at Hakata, Kyushu, they were driven out within a short time by army of Hojo Tokimune.

* 23 November 1275 (&quot;Kenji 1, 5th day of the 11th month&quot;): Hirohito&quot;-shinnō&quot; was named Crown Prince and heir to his first cousin, the &quot;Daikakuji-tō&quot; Emperor Go-Uda. This was the result of political maneuvering by Hirohito&#x27;s father, the Jimyōin-tō Emperor Go-Fukakusa.

In 1287, retired Emperor Go-Fukakusa, dissatisfied with the fact that his own lineage (the &quot;Jimyōin-tō&quot;) did not control the throne, while that of his younger brother, the retired Emperor Kameyama (the &quot;Daikakuji-tō&quot;) did, persuaded both the Bakufu and the imperial court to compel the Emperor to abdicate in favor of Go-Fukakusa&#x27;s son (Emperor Fushimi).

After this time, the struggle between the Jimyōin-tō and the Daikakuji-tō over the imperial throne continued. After Go-Uda&#x27;s abdication, his Daikakuji-tō controlled the throne from 1301 to 1308 (Emperor Go-Nijō) and again from 1318 until the era of northern and southern courts (begun 1332) when they became the southern court (ending in 1392).

Go-Uda was cloistered emperor during the reign of his own son, Go-Nijō, from 1301 until 1308, and again from 1318, when his second son Go-Daigo took the throne until 1321, when Go-Daigo began direct rule.
* 16 July 1324 (&quot;Genkō 4, 25th day of the 6th month&quot;): Go-Uda died at age 58.

Emperor Go-Uda&#x27;s Imperial mausoleum is the &quot;Rengebuji no misasagi&quot; (蓮華峯寺陵) in Ukyō-ku, Kyoto.

==Kugyō==
&quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Go-Uda&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Kujō Tadaie, 1274
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Ichijō Ietsune, 1274–1275
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Takatsukasa Kanehira, 1275–1278
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Takatsukasa Kanehira, 1278–1287
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Nijō Morotada, 1287–1289
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Nadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Go-Uda&#x27;s reign==
The years of Go-Uda&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Bun&#x27;ei&quot; (1264–1275)
* &quot;Kenji&quot; (1275–1278)
* &quot;Kōan&quot; (1278–1288)

<text>Thomas Edmund Dewey (March 24, 1902 – March 16, 1971) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 47th Governor of New York from 1943 to 1954. He was the Republican Party&#x27;s nominee for president of the United States in 1944 and 1948, losing the former election to Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the latter election to Harry S. Truman in a major upset. The 288 combined electoral votes Dewey received from both elections place him second behind William Jennings Bryan as the candidate with the most electoral votes who never acceded to the presidency.

As a New York City prosecutor and District Attorney in the 1930s and early 1940s, Dewey was relentless in his effort to curb the power of the American Mafia and of organized crime in general. Most famously, he successfully prosecuted Mafia boss Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano on charges of forced prostitution in 1936. Luciano was given a 30- to 50-year prison sentence. He also prosecuted and convicted Waxey Gordon, another prominent New York City gangster and bootlegger, on charges of tax evasion. Dewey almost succeeded in apprehending mobster Dutch Schultz as well, but Schultz was murdered in 1935, in a hit ordered by The Commission.

A progressive conservative, Dewey led the moderate faction of the Republican Party during the 1940s, and 1950s, in opposition to the more conservative Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft. Dewey was an advocate for the professional and business community of the Northeastern United States, which would later be called the Eastern Establishment. This group consisted of internationalists who were in favor of the United Nations and the Cold War fight against communism and the Soviet Union, and it supported most of the New Deal social-welfare reforms enacted during the administration of Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Dewey served as the 47th governor of New York from 1943 to 1954. In 1944, he was the Republican Party&#x27;s nominee for the presidency, but lost the election to incumbent Franklin D. Roosevelt in the closest of Roosevelt&#x27;s four presidential elections. Dewey won the Republican presidential nomination again in 1948; defeating Harold Stassen on his left and Robert A. Taft on his right. However, he lost to President Harry S. Truman in one of the greatest upsets in presidential election history. Dewey played a large role in winning the Republican presidential nomination for Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952, helping Eisenhower win the presidential election that year. He also played a large part in the choice of Richard Nixon as the Republican vice-presidential nominee in 1952 and 1956. He was the first major party nominee for president of the Greatest Generation, and the first to have been born in the 20th century.

Following his political retirement, Dewey served from 1955 to 1971 as a corporate lawyer and senior partner in his law firm Dewey Ballantine in New York City. In March 1971, while on a golfing vacation in Miami, Florida, he died from a heart attack. Following a public memorial ceremony at St. James&#x27; Episcopal Church in New York City, Dewey was buried in the town cemetery of Pawling, New York.

==Early life and family==

Dewey was born and raised in Owosso, Michigan, where his father, George Martin Dewey, owned, edited, and published the local newspaper, the &quot;Owosso Times&quot;. His mother, Annie (Thomas), whom he called &quot;Mater&quot;, bequeathed her son &quot;a healthy respect for common sense and the average man or woman who possessed it.&quot; She also left &quot;a headstrong assertiveness that many took for conceit, a set of small-town values never entirely erased by exposure to the sophisticated East, and a sense of proportion that moderated triumph and eased defeat.&quot; One journalist noted that as a boy &quot;he did show leadership and ambition above the average; by the time he was thirteen, he had a crew of nine other youngsters working for him&quot; selling newspapers and magazines in Owosso. In his senior year in high school he served as the president of his class, and was the chief editor of the school yearbook. His senior caption in the yearbook stated &quot;First in the council hall to steer the state, and ever foremost in a tongue debate&quot;, and a biographer wrote that &quot;the bent of his mind, from his earliest days, was towards debate.&quot; He received his B.A. degree from the University of Michigan in 1923, and his LL.B. degree from Columbia Law School in 1925.

While at the University of Michigan Dewey joined Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, a national fraternity for men of music, and was a member of the Men&#x27;s Glee Club. While growing up in Owosso he was a member of the choir at Christ Episcopal Church. He was an excellent singer with a deep, baritone voice, and in 1923 he finished in third place in the National Singing Contest. He briefly considered a career as a professional singer but decided against it after a temporary throat ailment convinced him that such a career would be risky. He then decided to pursue a career as a lawyer. He also wrote for &quot;The Michigan Daily,&quot; the university&#x27;s student newspaper.

On June 16, 1928, Dewey married Frances Eileen Hutt. They met in Chicago in 1923, when Dewey took singing lessons during a summer course offered by Percy Rector Stephens, for whom Hutt worked as a secretary. A native of Sherman, Texas who was raised in Sherman and in Sapulpa, Oklahoma, she was valedictorian of her 1920 high school class. Hutt was a singer and stage actress; after their marriage she dropped her acting career. They had two sons, Thomas E. Dewey Jr. and John Martin Dewey.

Although Dewey served as a prosecutor and District Attorney in New York City for many years, his home from 1939 until his death was a large farm, called &quot;Dapplemere,&quot; located near the town of Pawling some north of New York City. According to biographer Richard Norton Smith, Dewey &quot;loved Dapplemere as [he did] no other place&quot;, and Dewey was once quoted as saying that &quot;I work like a horse five days and five nights a week for the privilege of getting to the country on the weekend.&quot; In 1945, Dewey told a reporter that &quot;my farm is my roots ... the heart of this nation is the rural small town.&quot; Dapplemere was part of a tight-knit rural community called Quaker Hill, which was known as a haven for the prominent and well-to-do. Among Dewey&#x27;s neighbors on Quaker Hill were the famous reporter and radio broadcaster Lowell Thomas, the Reverend Norman Vincent Peale, and the legendary CBS News journalist Edward R. Murrow.

During his twelve years as governor, Dewey also kept a New York City residence and office in Suite 1527 of the Roosevelt Hotel. Dewey was an active, lifelong member of the Episcopal Church.

Dewey was a lifelong Republican, and in the 1920s and 1930s, he was a party worker in New York City, eventually rising to become Chair of The New York Young Republican Club in 1931. When asked in 1946, why he was a Republican, Dewey replied, &quot;I believe that the Republican Party is the best instrument for bringing sound government into the hands of competent men and by this means preserving our liberties ... But there is another reason why I am a Republican. I was born one.&quot;

==Prosecutor==

===Federal prosecutor===
Dewey first served as a federal prosecutor, then started a lucrative private practice on Wall Street; however, he left his practice for an appointment as special prosecutor to look into corruption in New York City—with the official title of Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. It was in this role that he first achieved headlines in the early 1930s, when he prosecuted bootlegger Waxey Gordon.

Dewey had used his excellent recall of details of crimes to trip up witnesses as a federal prosecutor; as a state prosecutor, he used telephone taps (which were perfectly legal at the time per &quot;Olmstead v. United States&quot; of 1928) to gather evidence, with the ultimate goal of bringing down entire criminal organizations. On that account, Dewey successfully lobbied for an overhaul in New York&#x27;s criminal procedure law, which at that time required separate trials for each count of an indictment. Dewey&#x27;s thoroughness and attention to detail became legendary; for one case he and his staff sifted &quot;through 100,000 telephone slips to convict a Prohibition-era bootlegger.&quot;

===Special prosecutor===
Dewey became famous in 1935, when he was appointed special prosecutor in New York County (Manhattan) by Governor Herbert H. Lehman. A &quot;runaway grand jury&quot; had publicly complained that William C. Dodge, the District Attorney, was not aggressively pursuing the mob and political corruption. Lehman, to avoid charges of partisanship, asked four prominent Republicans to serve as special prosecutor. All four refused and recommended Dewey.

Dewey moved ahead vigorously. He recruited a staff of over 60 assistants, investigators, process servers, stenographers, and clerks. New York Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia assigned a hand picked squad of 63 police officers to Dewey&#x27;s office. Dewey&#x27;s targets were &quot;organized&quot; racketeering: the large-scale criminal enterprises, especially extortion, the &quot;numbers racket&quot; and prostitution. One writer stated that &quot;Dewey ... put on a very impressive show. All the paraphernalia, the hideouts and tapped telephones and so on, became famous. More than any other American of his generation except [Charles] Lindbergh, Dewey became a creature of folklore and a national hero. What he appealed to most was the great American love of &quot;results.&quot; People were much more interested in his ends than in his means. Another key to all this may be expressed in a single word: honesty. Dewey was honest.&quot;

One of his biggest prizes was gangster Dutch Schultz, whom he had battled as both a federal and state prosecutor. Schultz&#x27;s first trial ended in a deadlock; prior to his second trial, Schultz had the venue moved to Malone, New York, then moved there and garnered the sympathy of the townspeople through charitable acts so that when it came time for his trial, the jury found him innocent, liking him too much to convict him.

Dewey and La Guardia threatened Schultz with instant arrest and further charges. Schultz now proposed to murder Dewey. Dewey would be killed while he made his daily morning call to his office from a pay phone near his home. However, New York crime boss Lucky Luciano and the &quot;Mafia Commission&quot; decided that Dewey&#x27;s murder would provoke an all-out crackdown. Instead they had Schultz killed. Schultz was shot to death in the restroom of a bar in Newark.

Dewey&#x27;s legal team turned their attention to Lucky Luciano. Assistant DA Eunice Carter oversaw investigations into prostitution racketeering. She raided 80 houses of prostitution in the New York City area and arrested hundreds of prostitutes and &quot;madams&quot;. Carter had developed trust with many of these women, and through her coaching, many of the arrested prostitutes – some of whom told of being beaten and abused by Mafia thugs – were willing to testify to avoid prison time. Three implicated Luciano as controller of organized prostitution in the New York/New Jersey area – one of the largest prostitution rings in American history. Carter&#x27;s investigation was the first to link Luciano to a crime. Dewey prosecuted the case, and in the greatest victory of his legal career, he won the conviction of Luciano for the prostitution racket, with a sentence of 30 to 50 years on June 18, 1936.

In January 1937, Dewey successfully prosecuted Tootsie Herbert, the leader of New York&#x27;s poultry racket, for embezzlement. Following his conviction, New York&#x27;s poultry &quot;marketplace returned to normal, and New York consumers saved $5 million in 1938 alone.&quot; That same month, Dewey, his staff, and New York City police made a series of dramatic raids that led to the arrest of 65 of New York&#x27;s leading operators in various rackets, including the bakery racket, numbers racket, and restaurant racket. &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran an editorial praising Dewey for breaking up the &quot;shadow government&quot; of New York&#x27;s racketeers, and &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; wrote &quot;If you don&#x27;t think Dewey is Public Hero No. 1, listen to the applause he gets every time he is shown in a newsreel.&quot;

In 1936, Dewey received The Hundred Year Association of New York&#x27;s Gold Medal Award &quot;in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York&quot;.

===Manhattan District Attorney===
In 1937, Dewey was elected New York County District Attorney (Manhattan), defeating the Democratic nominee after Dodge decided not to run for re-election. Dewey was such a popular candidate for District Attorney that &quot;election officials in Brooklyn posted large signs at polling places reading &#x27;Dewey Isn&#x27;t Running in This County&#x27;.&quot;

As District Attorney, Dewey successfully prosecuted and convicted Richard Whitney, former president of the New York Stock Exchange, for embezzlement. Whitney was given a five-year prison sentence. Dewey also successfully prosecuted Tammany Hall political boss James Joseph Hines on thirteen counts of racketeering. Following the favorable national publicity he received after his conviction of Hines, a May 1939 Gallup poll showed Dewey as the frontrunner for the 1940 Republican presidential nomination, and gave him a lead of 58% to 42% over President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a potential 1940 presidential campaign. In 1939, Dewey also tried and convicted American Nazi leader Fritz Julius Kuhn for embezzlement, crippling Kuhn&#x27;s organization and limiting its ability to support Nazi Germany in World War II.

During his four years as District Attorney, Dewey and his staff compiled a 94 percent conviction rate of defendants brought to trial, created new bureaus for Fraud, Rackets, and Juvenile Detention, and led an investigation into tenement houses with inadequate fire safety features that reduced &quot;their number from 13,000 to 3,500&quot; in a single year. When he left the District Attorney&#x27;s office in 1942 to run for governor, Dewey said that &quot;It has been learned in high places that clean government can also be good politics...I don&#x27;t like Republican thieves any more than Democratic ones.&quot;

By the late 1930s Dewey&#x27;s successful efforts against organized crime—and especially his conviction of Lucky Luciano—had turned him into a national celebrity. His nickname, the &quot;Gangbuster&quot;, was used for the popular 1930s &quot;Gang Busters&quot; radio series based on his fight against the mob. Hollywood film studios made several movies inspired by his exploits; &quot;Marked Woman&quot; starred Humphrey Bogart as a Dewey-like DA and Bette Davis as a &quot;party girl&quot; whose testimony helps convict the mob boss. A popular story from the time, possibly apocryphal, featured a young girl who told her father that she wanted to sue God to stop a prolonged spell of rain. When her father replied &quot;you can&#x27;t sue God and win&quot;, the girl said &quot;I can if Dewey is my lawyer.&quot;

==Governor of New York==

In 1984, journalists Neal Peirce and Jerry Hagstrom summarized Dewey&#x27;s governorship by saying, &quot;for sheer administrative talent, it is difficult to think of a twentieth-century governor who has excelled Thomas E. Dewey ... hundreds of thousands of New York youngsters owe Dewey thanks for his leadership in creating a state university ... a vigorous health-department program virtually eradicated tuberculosis in New York, highway building was pushed forward, and the state&#x27;s mental hygiene program was thoroughly reorganized.&quot; Dewey also created a powerful political organization that allowed him to dominate New York state politics and influence national politics.

=== Elections ===
In 1938 Edwin Jaeckle, the New York Republican Party Chairman, selected Dewey to run for Governor of New York against the Democratic incumbent, Herbert H. Lehman. Dewey was only 36 years of age. He based his campaign on his record as a famous prosecutor of organized-crime figures in New York City. Although he was defeated, Dewey&#x27;s surprisingly strong showing against the popular Lehman (he lost by only 1.4%) brought him national political attention and made him a front runner for the 1940 Republican presidential nomination.

Jaeckle was one of Dewey&#x27;s top advisors and mentors for the remainder of his political career.

In 1942, Dewey ran for governor again and won with a large plurality over Democrat John J. Bennett Jr., the outgoing state attorney general. Bennett was not endorsed by the American Labor Party, whose candidate, Dean Alfange, drew almost 10 percent of the ballots cast. The ALP endorsed for re-election incumbent lieutenant governor Charles Poletti, who lost narrowly to Dewey&#x27;s running mate Thomas W. Wallace.

In 1946, Dewey was re-elected by the greatest margin in state history to that point, almost 700,000 votes.

In 1950, he was elected to a third term by 572,000 votes.

=== Policies ===
Remembered as &quot;an odd mix, a pay-as-you-go liberal and a compassionate conservative&quot; and usually regarded as an honest and highly effective governor, Dewey doubled state aid to education, increased salaries for state employees and still reduced the state&#x27;s debt by over $100 million. He referred to his program as &quot;pay-as-you-go liberalism  ... government can be progressive and solvent at the same time.&quot; Additionally he put through the Ives-Quinn Act of 1945, the first state law in the country that prohibited racial discrimination in employment. As governor, Dewey signed legislation that created the State University of New York. Shortly after becoming governor in 1943, Dewey learned that some state workers and teachers were being paid only $900 a year, leading him to give &quot;hefty raises, some as high as 150%&quot; to state workers and teachers.

Dewey played a leading role in securing support and funding for the New York State Thruway, which was eventually named in his honor. Dewey also streamlined and consolidated many state agencies to make them more efficient. During the Second World War construction in New York was limited, which allowed Dewey to create a $623 million budget surplus, which he placed into his &quot;Postwar Reconstruction Fund.&quot; The fund would eventually create 14,000 new beds in the state&#x27;s mental health system, provide public housing for 30,000 families, allow for the reforestation of 34 million trees, create a water pollution program, provide slum clearance, and pay for a &quot;model veterans&#x27; program.&quot; His governorship was also &quot;friendlier by far than his [Democratic] predecessors to the private sector&quot;, as Dewey created a state Department of Commerce to &quot;lure new businesses and tourists to the Empire State, ease the shift from wartime boom, and steer small businessmen, in particular, through the maze of federal regulation and restriction.&quot; Between 1945 and 1948, 135,000 new businesses were started in New York.

Dewey supported the decision of the New York legislature to end state funding for child care centers, which were established during the war. The child care centers allowed mothers to participate in wartime industries. The state was forced to provide funding for local communities that could not obtain money under the Lanham Act. Although working mothers, helped by various civic and social groups, fought to retain funding, federal support for child care facilities was considered temporary and ended on March 1, 1946. New York state aid to child care ended on January 1, 1948. When protesters asked Dewey to keep the child care centers open, he called them &quot;Communists&quot;.

He strongly supported the death penalty. During his twelve years as governor, more than ninety people were electrocuted under New York authority. Among these were several of the mob-affiliated hitmen belonging to the murder-for-hire group Murder, Inc., which was headed up by major mob leaders Louis &quot;Lepke&quot; Buchalter and Albert Anastasia. Buchalter himself went to the chair in 1944.

According to one study

Dewey was a fiscal conservative but believed that Republicans should not attempt to repeal the New Deal; rather, they should advance competing social welfare programs that emphasized individual freedom and economic incentives instead of the Democrats&#x27; tendency towards centralization and collectivism.

A Dewey biographer said of Dewey that &quot;No doubt he was a conservative&quot;, but &quot;he was also realistic.&quot;

==Presidential campaigns==
===1940===
Dewey sought the 1940 Republican presidential nomination. He was considered the early favorite for the nomination, but his support ebbed in the late spring of 1940 as Nazi Germany invaded its neighbors, and Americans feared being drawn into another European war.

Some Republican leaders considered Dewey to be too young (at 38, just three years above the minimum age required by the US Constitution) and too inexperienced to lead the nation in wartime. Furthermore, Dewey&#x27;s non-interventionist stance became problematic when Germany quickly conquered France and seemed poised to invade Britain. As a result, at the 1940 Republican National Convention many delegates switched from Dewey to Wendell Willkie, who was a decade older and supported aid to the Allies fighting Germany. Dewey led on the first ballot, but was well below the vote total he needed to win. He steadily lost strength to Willkie in succeeding ballots, and Willkie was nominated on the convention&#x27;s sixth ballot. Willkie lost to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the general election.

===1944===
Dewey&#x27;s foreign-policy position evolved during the 1940s; by 1944 he was considered an internationalist and a supporter of projects such as the United Nations. It was in 1940 that Dewey first clashed with Robert A. Taft. Taft—who maintained his non-interventionist views and economic conservatism to his death—became Dewey&#x27;s great rival for control of the Republican Party in the 1940s and early 1950s. Dewey became the leader of moderate Republicans, who were based in the Eastern states, while Taft became the leader of conservative Republicans who dominated most of the Midwest.

Dewey was the frontrunner for the 1944 Republican nomination. In April 1944 he won the key Wisconsin primary, where he defeated Wendell Willkie and former Minnesota governor Harold Stassen. Willkie&#x27;s poor showing in Wisconsin forced him to quit the race and he died later that year. At the 1944 Republican Convention, Dewey&#x27;s chief rivals—Stassen and Ohio governor John W. Bricker—both withdrew and Dewey was nominated almost unanimously. Dewey then made Bricker (who was supported by Taft) his running mate. This made Dewey the first presidential candidate to be born in the 20th century. As of 2021, he was also the youngest Republican presidential nominee.

In the general election campaign, Dewey crusaded against the alleged inefficiencies, corruption and Communist influences in incumbent president Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal programs, but mostly avoided military and foreign policy debates. Dewey had considered including the conspiracy theory that Roosevelt knew about the attack on Pearl Harbor beforehand and allowed it to happen and to say: &quot;...and instead of being re-elected he should be impeached.&quot; The allegation would have suggested the then-secret fact that the U.S. had broken the Purple code still in use by the Japanese military. Dewey eventually yielded to Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall&#x27;s urging not to touch this topic. Marshall informed Harry Hopkins of his action in late October that year; Hopkins then told the president. Roosevelt reasoned that &quot;Dewey would not, for political purposes, give secret and vital information to the enemy&quot;.

During the campaign, in a first, Roosevelt provided Dewey with information on the war efforts, such as the breaking of Japanese naval code. This was the first time that an opposition presidential candidate was given briefings by the incumbent presidential administration.

Dewey lost the election on November 7, 1944, to President Roosevelt. He had polled 45.9% of the popular vote compared to Roosevelt&#x27;s 53.4%, a stronger showing against FDR than any previous Republican opponent. In the Electoral College, Roosevelt defeated Dewey by a margin of 432 to 99.

===1948===
Dewey was the Republican candidate again in the 1948 presidential election, with California Governor Earl Warren on the bottom half of the ticket. Dewey was almost unanimously projected to win against incumbent Harry S. Truman, who had taken over from FDR when he died in office in 1945.

During the primaries, Dewey was repeatedly urged to engage in red-baiting, but he refused. In a debate before the Oregon primary with Harold Stassen, Dewey argued against outlawing the Communist Party of the United States of America, saying &quot;you can&#x27;t shoot an idea with a gun.&quot; He later told Styles Bridges, the Republican national campaign manager, that he was not &quot;going around looking under beds&quot;.

Given Truman&#x27;s sinking popularity and the Democratic Party&#x27;s three-way split (the left-winger Henry A. Wallace and the Southern segregationist Strom Thurmond ran third-party campaigns), Dewey seemed unbeatable to the point that the Republicans believed that all they had to do to win was to avoid making any major mistakes.

Following this advice, Dewey carefully avoided risks and spoke in platitudes, avoiding controversial issues, and remained vague on what he planned to do as president, with speech after speech being nonpartisan and also filled with optimistic assertions or empty statements of the obvious, including the famous quote: &quot;You know that your future is still ahead of you.&quot; An editorial in the &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal&quot; summed it up:

No presidential candidate in the future will be so inept that four of his major speeches can be boiled down to these historic four sentences: Agriculture is important. Our rivers are full of fish. You cannot have freedom without liberty. Our future lies ahead.

Another reason Dewey ran such a cautious, vague campaign came from his experience as a presidential candidate in 1944, where Dewey felt that he had allowed Roosevelt to draw him into a partisan, verbal &quot;mudslinging&quot; match, and he believed that this had cost him votes.

Dewey was accordingly convinced in 1948 to appear as non-partisan as possible, and to emphasize the positive aspects of his campaign while ignoring his opponent: this strategy proved to be a total failure, as it allowed Truman to repeatedly criticize and ridicule Dewey, who never answered any of Truman&#x27;s criticisms.

Although Dewey was not as conservative as the Republican-controlled 80th Congress, the association proved problematic, as Truman tied Dewey to the &quot;do-nothing&quot; Congress.

Near the end of the campaign, Dewey considered adopting a more aggressive style and responding directly to Truman&#x27;s criticisms, going so far as to tell his aides one evening that he wanted to &quot;tear to shreds&quot; a speech draft and make it more critical of the Democratic ticket. However, nearly all his major advisors insisted that it would be a mistake to change tactics. Dewey&#x27;s wife Frances strongly opposed her husband changing tactics, telling him, &quot;If I have to stay up all night to see that you don&#x27;t tear up that speech [draft], I will.&quot; Dewey relented and continued to ignore Truman&#x27;s attacks and to focus on positive generalities instead of specific issues.

The &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; printed &quot;DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN&quot; as its post-election headline, issuing 150,000 copies before the returns showed Truman winning.

Dewey received 45.1% of the popular vote to Truman&#x27;s 49.6%. In the Electoral College, Dewey won 16 states with 189 electoral votes, Truman 28 states with 303 electoral votes, and Thurmond four states (all in the South) with 39 electoral votes. The key states in the election were Illinois, California, and Ohio, which together had a combined 78 electoral votes. Truman won each of these three states by less than one percentage point; had Dewey won all three states, he would have won the election in the Electoral College, and if he had any two, this would have forced a contingent election in the House of Representatives. Summarizing Dewey&#x27;s campaign, a biographer wrote that &quot;Dewey had swept the industrial Northeast, pared Democratic margins in the big cities by a third, run better than any Republican since Herbert Hoover in the South, and still lost decisively.&quot; After the election, Dewey told publisher Henry Luce that &quot;you can analyze figures from now to kingdom come, and all they will show is that we lost the farm vote which we had in 1944 and that lost us the election.&quot;

A biographer noted that Dewey &quot;rarely mentioned 1948 in the years thereafter. It was like a locked room in a musty mansion whose master never entered ... he seemed a bit bewildered at the unanimous front put up by his Albany advisers [during the campaign], regretted not having taken a final poll when his own senses detected slippage, and couldn&#x27;t resist a potshot at &quot;that bastard Truman&quot; for having successfully exploited farmers&#x27; fears of a new depression.&quot;

Pre-election planning by Dewey and his advisors for a potential presidential transition was much greater in 1948 than in any previous election cycle, and included selection by Dewey of potential cabinet officers. Though these efforts were ridiculed after Dewey was defeated, pre-election transition planning later became standard practice.

===1952===
Dewey did not run for president in 1952, but he played a key role in securing the Republican nomination for General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Taft was a candidate and, given his age, he freely admitted 1952 would be his last chance to win the presidency. Once Eisenhower became a candidate, Dewey used his powerful political machine to win Eisenhower the support of delegates in New York and elsewhere.

The 1952 campaign culminated in a climactic moment in the fierce rivalry between Dewey and Taft for control of the Republican Party. At the Republican Convention, pro-Taft delegates and speakers verbally attacked Dewey as the real power behind Eisenhower, but Dewey had the satisfaction of seeing Eisenhower win the nomination and end Taft&#x27;s presidential hopes for the last time.

Dewey played a major role in helping California Senator Richard Nixon become Eisenhower&#x27;s running mate. When Eisenhower won the presidency later that year, many of Dewey&#x27;s closest aides and advisors became leading figures in the Eisenhower Administration. Among them were Herbert Brownell, who would become Eisenhower&#x27;s Attorney General; James Hagerty, who would become White House Press Secretary; and John Foster Dulles, who would become Eisenhower&#x27;s Secretary of State.

Dewey&#x27;s campaign to secure the nomination for Eisenhower saw Dewey at odds with his two running mates. 1948 vice presidential nominee Warren was a candidate for the presidential nomination, while 1944 running mate John W. Bricker backed Taft.

== Rivalry with Robert A. Taft ==
Dewey&#x27;s biographer Richard Norton Smith wrote, &quot;For fifteen years ... these two combatants waged political warfare. Their dispute pitted East against Midwest, city against countryside, internationalist against isolationist, pragmatic liberals against principled conservatives. Each man thought himself the genuine spokesman of the future; each denounced the other as a political heretic.&quot; 

In a 1949 speech, Dewey criticized Taft and his followers by saying that &quot;we have in our party some fine, high-minded patriotic people who honestly oppose farm price supports, unemployment insurance, old age benefits, slum clearance, and other social programs... these people believe in a laissez-faire society and look back wistfully to the miscalled &#x27;good old days&#x27; of the nineteenth century... if such efforts to turn back the clock are actually pursued, you can bury the Republican Party as the deadest pigeon in the country.&quot; He added that people who opposed such social programs should &quot;go out and try to get elected in a typical American community and see what happens to them. But they ought not to do it as Republicans.&quot;

In the speech, Dewey added that the Republican Party believed in social progress &quot;under a flourishing, competitive system of private enterprise where every human right is expanded ... we are opposed to delivering the nation into the hands of any group who will have the power to tell the American people whether they may have food or fuel, shelter or jobs.&quot; Dewey believed in what he called &quot;compassionate capitalism&quot;, and argued that &quot;in the modern age, man&#x27;s needs include as much economic security as is consistent with individual freedom.&quot; When Taft and his supporters criticized Dewey&#x27;s policies as liberal &quot;me-tooism&quot;, or &quot;aping the New Deal in a vain attempt to outbid Roosevelt&#x27;s heirs&quot;, Dewey responded that he was following in the tradition of Republicans such as Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, and that &quot;it was conservative reforms like anti-trust laws and federal regulation of railroads ... that retained the allegiance of the people for a capitalist system combining private incentive and public conscience.&quot;

His rivalry with Taft notwithstanding, Dewey nevertheless went surreptitiously to the hospital in 1953 to visit with Taft when the latter was gravely ill. The two talked for half an hour, and afterward Taft joked that &quot;Tom came around to see whether I am really out of the running.&quot;

==Later career==


In May 1953, Governor Dewey set up a nine-member advisory board to help the State Safety Division&#x27;s Bureau of Safety and Accident Prevention and appointed Edward Burton Hughes (the Deputy New York State Superintendent of Public Works) as chairman. The advisory board was formed to draft accident prevention policies and programs.

Dewey&#x27;s third term as governor of New York expired at the end of 1954, after which he retired from public service and returned to his law practice, Dewey Ballantine, although he remained a power broker behind the scenes in the Republican Party. In 1956, when Eisenhower mulled not running for a second term, he suggested Dewey as his choice as successor, but party leaders made it plain that they would not entrust the nomination to Dewey yet again, and ultimately Eisenhower decided to run for re-election. Dewey also played a major role that year in convincing Eisenhower to keep Nixon as his running mate; Eisenhower had considered dropping Nixon from the Republican ticket and picking someone he felt would be less partisan and controversial. However, Dewey argued that dropping Nixon from the ticket would only anger Republican voters while winning Eisenhower few votes from the Democrats. Dewey&#x27;s arguments helped convince Eisenhower to keep Nixon on the ticket. In 1960, Dewey would strongly support Nixon&#x27;s ultimately unsuccessful presidential campaign against Democrat John F. Kennedy.

Although Dewey publicly supported Nelson Rockefeller in all four of his campaigns for Governor of New York, and backed Rockefeller in his losing 1964 bid for the Republican presidential nomination against Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, he did privately express concern and disappointment with what he regarded as Rockefeller&#x27;s &quot;spendthrift&quot; methods as governor, and once told him &quot;I like you Nelson, but I don&#x27;t think I can afford you.&quot; In 1968, when both Rockefeller and Nixon were competing for the Republican presidential nomination, Dewey was publicly neutral, but &quot;privately, according to close friends, he favored Nixon.&quot;

By the 1960s, as the conservative wing assumed more and more power within the Republican Party, Dewey removed himself further and further from party matters. When the Republicans in 1964 gave the conservative Senator Goldwater their presidential nomination, Dewey declined to even attend the Republican Convention in San Francisco; it was the first Republican Convention he had missed since 1936. Still, however, he did publicly support Goldwater for president in the election.

Although closely identified with the Republican Party for virtually his entire adult life, Dewey was a close friend of Democratic Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, and Dewey aided Humphrey in being named as the Democratic nominee for vice-president in 1964, advising President Lyndon Johnson on ways to block efforts at the party convention by Kennedy loyalists to stampede Robert F. Kennedy onto the ticket as Johnson&#x27;s running mate.

In the mid-1960s, President Johnson tried to convince Dewey to accept positions on several government commissions, especially a national crime commission, which Johnson wanted Dewey to chair. After Nixon won the presidency in 1968, there were rumors that Dewey would be offered a Cabinet position, or a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. However, Dewey declined all offers to return to government service, preferring instead to concentrate on his highly profitable law firm. By the early 1960s, his share of the firm&#x27;s profits had made him a millionaire, and his net worth at the time of his death was estimated at over $3 million (or over $ million in dollars).

Dewey was offered the position of Chief Justice of the United States twice, first by Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953 and again by Richard Nixon in 1969. He declined the offer both times. Two years after the 1948 campaign, Harry S. Truman offered Dewey the position of United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom. However, he declined the offer.

== Death ==
Dewey&#x27;s wife Frances died in July 1970, six years after being diagnosed with breast cancer. Later that year he began dating actress Kitty Carlisle, and there was talk of marriage.

On March 15, 1971, Dewey traveled to Miami, Florida, for a brief golfing vacation with his friend Dwayne Andreas, and others. The next day, following a round of golf with baseball star Carl Yastrzemski, Dewey failed to appear for his ride to Miami International Airport. He was found dead in his hotel room. An autopsy determined that he had died suddenly from a heart attack.

Following a public memorial service at Saint James&#x27; Episcopal Church in New York City, which was attended by President Nixon, former vice president Hubert Humphrey, New York governor Nelson Rockefeller, and other prominent politicians, Dewey was buried next to his wife Frances in the town cemetery of Pawling, New York. After his death, his farm of Dapplemere was sold and renamed &quot;Dewey Lane Farm&quot; in his honor.

==Public image==
Dewey received varied reactions from the public and fellow politicians, with praise for his good intentions, honesty, administrative talents, and inspiring speeches, but most of them also criticized his ambition and his perceived stiffness in public. One of his biographers wrote that he had &quot;a personality that attracted contempt and adulation in equal proportion.&quot;

Dewey was a forceful and inspiring speaker, traveling the whole country during his presidential campaigns and attracting uncommonly huge crowds. His friend and neighbor Lowell Thomas believed that Dewey was &quot;an authentic colossus&quot; whose &quot;appetite for excellence [tended] to frighten less obsessive types&quot;, and his 1948 running mate Earl Warren &quot;professed little personal affection for Dewey, but [believed] him a born executive who would make a great president.&quot; The pollster George Gallup once described Dewey as &quot;the ablest public figure of his lifetime... the most misunderstood man in recent American history.&quot;

On the other hand, President Franklin D. Roosevelt privately called Dewey &quot;the little man&quot; and a &quot;son of a bitch&quot;, and to Robert Taft and other conservative Republicans Dewey &quot;became synonymous with ... New York newspapers, New York banks, New York arrogance – the very city Taft&#x27;s America loves to hate.&quot; A Taft supporter once referred to Dewey as &quot;that snooty little governor of New York.&quot;

Herbert Brownell, Dewey&#x27;s campaign manager in his 1944 and 1948 presidential campaigns, later recalled that Dewey was &quot;a tough man to herd...He&#x27;d see a local political leader who wasn&#x27;t doing a very good job and he&#x27;d tell him so. Well, he should have left that to his managers to do...he could tell another person what to do brilliantly, but he wouldn&#x27;t do it himself. He&#x27;d give me the perfect formula for handling a difficult person, but then he&#x27;d get annoyed at something the guy said.&quot; According to Brownell, &quot;perfectionism had its price, and Dewey paid it...He didn&#x27;t really like handshaking, and he wasn&#x27;t good at it...he&#x27;d climbed up the [political] ladder the hard way. He worked harder, studied longer than anyone else. He could take a problem, break it down into component parts, assign it to talented people. He was a real fighter. As president he would have been boss, but the glad handing, small talk, personality side of politics, he just could not do.&quot; When asked if Dewey was happy in politics, Brownell replied &quot;I don&#x27;t think he was ever happy. He got joy out of attainment. He was satisfied with many of his accomplishments. But as for happiness, in the usual sense of the word – he wasn&#x27;t really geared to our political system.&quot;

=== Appearance and knowledge ===
Dewey grew his mustache when he was dating Frances, and because &quot;she liked it, the mustache stayed, to delight cartoonists and dismay political advisers for 20 years.&quot; During the 1944 election campaign, Dewey suffered an unexpected blow when Alice Roosevelt Longworth was reported as having mocked Dewey as &quot;the little man on the wedding cake&quot;, alluding to his neat mustache and dapper dress. It was ridicule he could never shake.

Dewey alienated former Republican president Herbert Hoover, who confided to a friend &quot;Dewey has no inner reservoir of knowledge on which to draw for his thinking,&quot; elaborating that &quot;A man couldn&#x27;t wear a mustache like that without having it affect his mind.&quot;

=== Aloofness ===
Dewey had a tendency towards pomposity and was considered stiff and unapproachable in public, with his aide Ruth McCormick Simms once describing him as &quot;cold, cold as a February iceberg&quot;. She added that &quot;he was brilliant and thoroughly honest.&quot;

During his governorship, one writer observed: &quot;A blunt fact about Mr. Dewey should be faced: it is that many people do not like him. He is, unfortunately, one of the least seductive personalities in public life. That he has made an excellent record as governor is indisputable. Even so, people resent what they call his vindictiveness, the &#x27;metallic&#x27; nature of his efficiency, his cockiness (which actually conceals a nature basically shy), and his suspiciousness. People say... that he is as devoid of charm as a rivet or a lump of stone.&quot;

However, Dewey&#x27;s friends considered him a warm and friendly companion. Journalist Irwin Ross noted that, &quot;more than most politicians, [Dewey] displayed an enormous gap between his private and his public manner. To friends and colleagues he was warm and gracious, considerate of others&#x27; views… He could tell a joke and was not dismayed by an off-color story. In public, however, he tended to freeze up, either out of diffidence or too stern a sense of the dignity of office. The smiles would seem forced… the glad-handing gesture awkward.&quot;

A magazine writer described the difference between Dewey&#x27;s private and public behavior by noting that, &quot;Till he gets to the door, he may be cracking jokes and laughing like a schoolboy. But the moment he enters a room he ceases to be Tom Dewey and becomes what he thinks the Governor of New York ought to be.&quot;

Leo W. O&#x27;Brien, a reporter for United Press International (UPI) who was later elected to Congress as a Democrat, recalled Dewey in an interview by saying that &quot;I hated his guts when he first came to Albany, and I loved him by the time he left. It was almost tragic – how he put on a pose that alienated people. Behind a pretty thin veneer he was a wonderful guy.&quot; John Gunther wrote in 1947 that many supporters were fiercely loyal to Dewey.

=== Opportunism and vagueness ===
Dewey&#x27;s presidential campaigns were hampered by Dewey&#x27;s habit of not being &quot;prematurely specific&quot; on controversial issues. President Truman poked fun at Dewey&#x27;s vague campaign by joking that G.O.P. actually stood for &quot;grand old platitudes.&quot;

Dewey&#x27;s frequent refusal to discuss specific issues and proposals in his campaigns was based partly on his belief in public opinion polls; one biographer claimed that he &quot;had an almost religious belief in the revolutionary science of public-opinion sampling.&quot; He was the first presidential candidate to employ his own team of pollsters, and when a worried businessman told Dewey in the 1948 presidential campaign that he was losing ground to Truman and urged him to &quot;talk specifics in his closing speeches&quot;, Dewey and his aide Paul Lockwood displayed polling data that showed Dewey still well ahead of Truman, and Dewey told the businessman &quot;when you&#x27;re leading, don&#x27;t talk.&quot;

Walter Lippman regarded Dewey as an opportunist, who &quot;changes his views from hour to hour… always more concerned with taking the popular position than he is in dealing with the real issues.&quot;

The journalist John Gunther wrote that &quot;There are plenty of vain and ambitious and uncharming politicians. This would not be enough to cause Dewey&#x27;s lack of popularity. What counts more is that so many people think of him as opportunistic. Dewey seldom goes out on a limb by taking a personal position which may be unpopular... every step is carefully calculated and prepared.&quot;

=== Relationship with legislators ===
As governor, Dewey had a reputation for ruthless treatment of New York legislators and political opponents.

[Dewey] cracked the whip ruthlessly on [Republican] legislators who strayed from the party fold. Assemblymen have found themselves under investigation by the State Tax Department after opposing the Governor over an insurance regulation bill. Others discover job-rich construction projects, state buildings, even highways, directed to friendlier [legislators]... [He] forced the legislature his own party dominates to reform its comfortable ways of payroll padding. Now legislative workers must verify in writing every two weeks what they have been doing to earn their salary; every state senator and assemblyman must verify that [they] are telling the truth. All this has occasioned more than grumbling. Some Assemblymen have quit in protest. Others have been denied renomination by Dewey&#x27;s formidable political organization. Reporters mutter among themselves about government by blackmail.

=== Honesty and integrity ===
Dewey received positive publicity for his reputation for honesty and integrity. The newspaper editor William Allen White praised Dewey as &quot;an honest cop with the mind of an honest cop.&quot; An October 1953 editorial in the &quot;Oneonta Star&quot; said that &quot;We think the Governor is ruthless in his actions, but we also think he will countenance nothing that smacks of trickery and dishonesty in public administration.&quot;

He insisted on having every candidate for a job paying $2,500 or more rigorously probed by state police. He was so concerned about the elected public official being motivated by the wealth his position could produce that he frequently said, &quot;No man should be in public office who can&#x27;t make more money in private life.&quot; Dewey accepted no anonymous campaign contributions and had every large contributor not known personally to him investigated &quot;for motive.&quot; When he signed autographs, he would date them so that no one could imply a closer relationship than actually existed.

A journalist noted in 1947 that Dewey &quot;has never made the slightest attempt to capitalize on his enormous fame, except politically. Even when temporarily out of office, in the middle 1930s, he rigorously resisted any temptation to be vulgarized or exploited...he could easily have become a millionaire several times over by succumbing to various movie and radio offers. He would have had to do nothing except give permission for movies or radio serials to be built around his career and name. Be it said to his honor, he never did so.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 1964, the New York State legislature officially renamed the New York State Thruway in honor of Dewey. Signs on Interstate 95 between the end of the Bruckner Expressway (in the Bronx) and the Connecticut state line, as well as on the Thruway mainline (Interstate 87 between the Bronx–Westchester line and Albany, and Interstate 90 between Albany and the New York–Pennsylvania line) designate the name as &quot;Governor Thomas E. Dewey Thruway&quot;, though this official designation is rarely used in reference to these roads.

Dewey&#x27;s official papers from his years in politics and public life were given to the University of Rochester; they are housed in the university library and are available to historians and other writers.

In 2005, the New York City Bar Association named an award after Dewey. The Thomas E. Dewey Medal, formerly sponsored by the law firm of Dewey &amp; LeBoeuf LLP, is awarded annually to one outstanding assistant district attorney in each of New York City&#x27;s five counties (New York, Kings, Queens, Bronx, and Richmond). The medal was first awarded on November 29, 2005. The Thomas E. Dewey Medal is now sponsored by the law firm Dewey Pegno &amp; Kramarsky LLP.

In May 2012, Dewey &amp; LeBoeuf (the successor firm to Dewey Ballantine) filed for bankruptcy.

Disney writer Dana Coty named Donald Duck&#x27;s nephew Dewey after Thomas E. Dewey.

<doc id="45597" wikidata="Q131581" url="?curid=45597" title="Henry V of England">
<text>Henry V (16 September 1386 – 31 August 1422), also called Henry of Monmouth, was King of England from 1413 until his death in 1422. Despite his relatively short reign, Henry&#x27;s outstanding military successes in the Hundred Years&#x27; War against France made England one of the strongest military powers in Europe. Immortalised in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henriad&quot; plays, Henry is known and celebrated as one of the greatest warrior-kings of medieval England.

Henry of Monmouth, the eldest son of Henry IV, became heir apparent and Prince of Wales after his father seized the throne in 1399. During the reign of his father, the young Prince Henry gained military experience fighting the Welsh during the revolt of Owain Glyndŵr, and against the powerful Percy family of Northumberland. He played a central part at the Battle of Shrewsbury despite being just sixteen years of age. As he entered adulthood, Henry played an increasingly central role in England&#x27;s government due to the declining health of his father, but disagreements between Henry and his father led to political conflict between the two. After his father&#x27;s death in March 1413, Henry ascended to the throne of England and assumed complete control of the country, also reviving the historic English claim to the French throne.

In 1415, Henry followed in the wake of his great-grandfather, Edward III, by renewing the Hundred Years&#x27; War with France, beginning the Lancastrian phase of the conflict (1415–1453). His first military campaign included capturing the port of Harfleur and a famous victory at the Battle of Agincourt, which inspired a proto-nationalistic fervour in England. During his second campaign (1417–20), his armies captured Paris and conquered most of northern France, including the formerly English-held Duchy of Normandy. Taking advantage of political divisions within France, Henry put unparalleled pressure on Charles VI of France (&quot;the Mad&quot;), resulting in the largest holding of French territory by an English king since the Angevin Empire. The Treaty of Troyes (1420) recognised Henry V as regent of France and heir apparent to the French throne, disinheriting Charles&#x27;s own son, the Dauphin Charles. Henry was subsequently married to Charles VI&#x27;s daughter, Catherine of Valois. The treaty ratified the unprecedented formation of a union between the kingdoms of England and France, in the person of Henry, upon the death of the ailing Charles. However, Henry died in August 1422, less than two months before his father-in-law, and was succeeded by his only son and heir, the infant Henry VI.

Analyses of Henry&#x27;s reign are varied. According to Charles Ross, he was widely praised for his personal piety, bravery, and military genius; Henry was admired even by contemporary French chroniclers. However, his occasionally cruel temperament and lack of focus regarding domestic affairs have made him the subject of criticism. Nonetheless, Adrian Hastings believes his militaristic pursuits during the Hundred Years&#x27; War fostered a strong sense of English nationalism and set the stage for the rise of England (later Great Britain) to prominence as a dominant global power.

== Early life ==
=== Birth and family ===
Henry was born in the tower above the gatehouse of Monmouth Castle in Monmouthshire, and for that reason was sometimes called Henry of Monmouth. He was the son of Henry of Bolingbroke (later Henry IV of England) and Mary de Bohun. His father&#x27;s cousin was the reigning English monarch, Richard II. Henry&#x27;s paternal grandfather was the influential John of Gaunt, a son of Edward III. As he was not close to the line of succession to the throne, Henry&#x27;s date of birth was not officially documented, and for many years it was disputed whether he was born in 1386 or 1387. However, records indicate that his younger brother Thomas was born in the autumn of 1387 and that his parents were at Monmouth in 1386 but not in 1387. It is now accepted that he was born on 16 September 1386.

Upon the exile of Henry&#x27;s father in 1398, Richard II took the boy into his own charge and treated him kindly. The young Henry accompanied Richard to Ireland. While in the royal service, he visited Trim Castle in County Meath, the ancient meeting place of the Parliament of Ireland.

In 1399, John of Gaunt died. In the same year Richard II was overthrown by the Lancastrian usurpation that brought Henry&#x27;s father to the throne, and Henry was recalled from Ireland into prominence as heir apparent to the Kingdom of England. He was created Prince of Wales at his father&#x27;s coronation and Duke of Lancaster on 10 November 1399, the third person to hold the title that year. His other titles were Duke of Cornwall, Earl of Chester and Duke of Aquitaine. A contemporary record notes that in 1399, Henry spent time at The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, under the care of his uncle Henry Beaufort, the chancellor of the university. During this time, due to taking a liking to both literature and music, he learned to read and write in the vernacular; this made him the first English King that was educated in this regard. He even went on to grant pensions to composers due to such love for music.

== Early military career and role in Government ==
From 1400 to 1404, he carried out the duties of High Sheriff of Cornwall. During that time, Henry was also in command of part of the English forces. He led his own army into Wales against Owain Glyndŵr and joined forces with his father to fight Henry &quot;Hotspur&quot; Percy at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403. It was there that the 16-year-old prince was almost killed by an arrow in his left cheekbone. An ordinary soldier might have died from such a wound, but Henry had the benefit of the best possible care. Over a period of several days, John Bradmore, the royal physician, treated the wound with honey to act as an antiseptic, crafted a tool to screw into the embedded arrowhead (bodkin point) and thus extract it without doing further damage, and flushed the wound with alcohol. The operation was successful, but it left Henry with permanent scars - evidence of his experience in battle. Bradmore recorded this account in Latin, in his manuscript titled &quot;Philomena&quot;. Henry&#x27;s treatment also appeared in an anonymous Middle English surgical treatise dated to 1446, that has since been attributed to Thomas Morstede.

The Welsh revolt of Owain Glyndŵr absorbed Henry&#x27;s energies until 1408. Then, as a result of the king&#x27;s ill health, Henry began to take a wider share in politics. From January 1410, helped by his uncles Henry and Thomas Beaufort, legitimised sons of John of Gaunt, he had practical control of the government. Both in foreign and domestic policy he differed from the king, who discharged his son from the council in November 1411. The quarrel between father and son was political only, though it is probable that the Beauforts had discussed the abdication of Henry IV. Their opponents certainly endeavoured to defame Prince Henry.

It may be that the tradition of Henry&#x27;s riotous youth, immortalised by Shakespeare, is partly due to political enmity. Henry&#x27;s record of involvement in war and politics, even in his youth, disproves this tradition. The most famous incident, his quarrel with the chief justice, has no contemporary authority and was first related by Sir Thomas Elyot in 1531.

The story of Falstaff originated in Henry&#x27;s early friendship with Sir John Oldcastle, a supporter of the Lollards. Shakespeare&#x27;s Falstaff was originally named &quot;Oldcastle&quot;, following his main source, &quot;The Famous Victories of Henry V&quot;. Oldcastle&#x27;s descendants objected, and the name was changed (the character became a composite of several real persons, including Sir John Fastolf). That friendship, and the prince&#x27;s political opposition to Thomas Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury, perhaps encouraged Lollard hopes. If so, their disappointment may account for the statements of ecclesiastical writers like Thomas Walsingham that Henry, on becoming king, was suddenly changed into a new man.

== Reign (1413–1422) ==
=== Accession ===
After Henry IV died on 20 March 1413, Henry V succeeded him and was crowned on 9 April 1413 at Westminster Abbey. The ceremony was marked by a terrible snowstorm, but the common people were undecided as to whether it was a good or bad omen. Henry was described as having been &quot;very tall (6 feet 3 inches), slim, with dark hair cropped in a ring above the ears, and clean-shaven&quot;. His complexion was ruddy, his face lean with a prominent and pointed nose. Depending on his mood, his eyes &quot;flashed from the mildness of a dove&#x27;s to the brilliance of a lion&#x27;s&quot;.

=== Domestic affairs ===
Henry tackled all of the domestic policies together and gradually built on them a wider policy. From the first, he made it clear that he would rule England as the head of a united nation. He let past differences be forgotten—the late Richard II was honourably re-interred; the young Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, was taken into favour; the heirs of those who had suffered under the last reign were restored gradually to their titles and estates. Yet, where Henry saw a grave domestic danger, he acted firmly and ruthlessly, such as during the Lollard discontent in January 1414 and including the execution by burning of Henry&#x27;s old friend, Sir John Oldcastle, in 1417 to &quot;nip the movement in the bud&quot; and make his own position as ruler secure.

Henry&#x27;s reign was generally free from serious trouble at home. The exception was the Southampton Plot in favour of Mortimer, involving Henry, Baron Scrope, and Richard, Earl of Cambridge (grandfather of the future King Edward IV), in July 1415. Mortimer himself remained loyal to the King.

Starting in August 1417, Henry promoted the use of the English language in government and his reign marks the appearance of Chancery Standard English as well as the adoption of English as the language of record within government. He was the first king to use English in his personal correspondence since the Norman Conquest 350 years earlier.

=== War in France ===
==== Dispute with France ====
Henry could now turn his attention to foreign affairs. A writer of the next generation was the first to allege that Henry was encouraged by ecclesiastical statesmen to enter into the French war as a means of diverting attention from home troubles. This story seems to have no foundation. Old commercial disputes and the support the French had lent to Owain Glyndŵr were used as an excuse for war, while the disordered state of France afforded no security for peace. King Charles VI of France was prone to mental illness; at times he thought he was made of glass, and his eldest surviving son, Louis, Duke of Guyenne, was an unpromising prospect. However, it was the old dynastic claim to the throne of France, first pursued by Edward III of England, that justified war with France in English opinion.

Henry may have regarded the assertion of his own claims as part of his royal duty, but a permanent settlement of the national debate was essential to the success of his foreign policy. Following the instability back in England during the reign of King Richard II, the war in France came to a halt, as during most of his reign relations between England 
and France were largely peaceful and so they were during his father&#x27;s reign as well. But in 1415, hostilities were renewed between the two nations, and though Henry had a claim to the French throne, through his great–grandfather King Edward III by his mother&#x27;s side, the French ultimately rejected this claim as its nobles pointed out that under the Salic law of the Franks, women were forbidden from inheriting the throne. Thus the throne went to a distant male relative of a cadet branch of the House of Capet, Philip VI of France, resulting in the Hundred Years&#x27; War beginning in 1337. Wanting to claim the French throne for himself, Henry resumed the war against France in 1415. This would lead to one of England&#x27;s most successful military campaigns during the whole conflict and would result in one of the most decisive victories for an English army during this period.

==== 1415 campaign ====

On 12 August 1415, Henry sailed for France, where his forces besieged the fortress at Harfleur, capturing it on 22 September. Afterwards, he decided to march with his army across the French countryside toward Calais against the warnings of his council. On 25 October, on the plains near the village of Agincourt, a French army intercepted his route. Despite his men-at-arms&#x27; being exhausted, outnumbered and malnourished, Henry led his men into battle, decisively defeating the French, who suffered severe losses. The French men-at-arms were bogged down in the muddy battlefield, soaked from the previous night of heavy rain, thus hindering the French advance and making them sitting targets for the flanking English archers. Most were simply hacked to death while completely stuck in the deep mud. It was Henry&#x27;s greatest military victory, ranking alongside the Battle of Crécy (1346) and the Battle of Poitiers (1356) as the greatest English victories of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. This victory both solidified and strengthened Henry V&#x27;s own rule in England and also legitimized his claim to the French throne more than ever.

During the battle, Henry ordered that the French prisoners taken during the battle be put to death, including some of the most illustrious who could have been held for ransom. Cambridge historian Brett Tingley suggests that Henry ordered them killed out of concern that the prisoners might turn on their captors when the English were busy repelling a third wave of enemy troops, thus jeopardising a hard-fought victory.

The victorious conclusion of Agincourt, from the English viewpoint, was only the first step in the campaign to recover the French possessions that Henry felt belonged to the English crown. Agincourt also held out the promise that Henry&#x27;s pretensions to the French throne might be realized. After the victory, Henry marched to Calais and the king returned in triumph to England in November and received a hero&#x27;s welcome. The brewing nationalistic sentiment among the English people was so great that contemporary writers describe firsthand how Henry was welcomed with triumphal pageantry into London upon his return. These accounts also describe how Henry was greeted by elaborate displays and with choirs following his passage to St.Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

Most importantly, the victory at Agincourt inspired and boosted the English morale, while it caused a heavy blow to the French as it further aided the English in their conquest of Normandy and much of northern France by 1419. The French, especially the nobility, who by this stage were weakened and exhausted by the disaster, began quarrelling and fighting among themselves. This quarrelling also led to a division in the French aristocracy and caused a rift in the French royal family, leading to infighting. By 1420, a treaty was signed between Henry V and Charles VI of France, known as the Treaty of Troyes, which acknowledged Henry as regent and heir to the French throne and also married Henry to Charles&#x27;s daughter Catherine of Valois.

==== Diplomacy ====
Following the Battle of Agincourt, King Sigismund of Hungary (later Holy Roman Emperor) made a visit to Henry in hopes of making peace between England and France. His goal was to persuade Henry to modify his demands against the French. Henry lavishly entertained him and even had him enrolled in the Order of the Garter. Sigismund, in turn, inducted Henry into the Order of the Dragon. Henry had intended to crusade for the order after uniting the English and French thrones, but he died before fulfilling his plans. Sigismund left England several months later, having signed the Treaty of Canterbury acknowledging English claims to France.

Command of the sea was secured by driving the Genoese allies of the French out of the English Channel. While Henry was occupied with peace negotiations in 1416, a French and Genoese fleet surrounded the harbour at the English-garrisoned Harfleur. A French land force also besieged the town. In March 1416 a raiding force of soldiers under the Earl of Dorset, Thomas Beaufort, was attacked and narrowly escaped defeat at the Battle of Valmont after a counterattack by the garrison of Harfleur. To relieve the town, Henry sent his brother, John, Duke of Bedford, who raised a fleet and set sail from Beachy Head on 14 August. The Franco-Genoese fleet was defeated the following day after the gruelling seven-hour Battle of the Seine and Harfleur was relieved. Diplomacy successfully detached Emperor Sigismund from supporting France, and the Treaty of Canterbury — also signed in August 1416 — confirmed a short-lived alliance between England and the Holy Roman Empire.

=== 1417–1421 campaigns ===
With those two potential enemies gone, and after two years of patient preparation following the Battle of Agincourt, Henry renewed the war on a larger scale in 1417. After taking Caen, he quickly conquered Lower Normandy and Rouen was cut off from Paris and besieged. This siege has cast an even darker shadow on the reputation of the king adding to the loss of honor following his order to slay the French prisoners at Agincourt. The leaders of Rouen, who were unable to support and feed the women and children of the town, forced them out through the gates believing that Henry would allow them to pass through his army unmolested. However, Henry refused to allow this, and the expelled women and children died of starvation in the ditches surrounding the town. The French were paralysed by the disputes between the Burgundians and the Armagnacs. Henry skillfully played one against the other without relaxing his warlike approach.

In January 1419, Rouen fell. Those Norman French who had resisted were severely punished: Alain Blanchard, who had hanged English prisoners from the walls of Rouen, was summarily executed; Robert de Livet, Canon of Rouen, who had excommunicated the English king, was packed off to England and imprisoned for five years.

By August, the English were outside the walls of Paris. The intrigues of the French parties culminated in the assassination of John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy, by the Dauphin Charles&#x27;s partisans at Montereau-Fault-Yonne on 10 September. Philip the Good, the new duke, and the French court threw themselves into Henry&#x27;s arms. After six months of negotiation, the Treaty of Troyes recognised Henry as the heir and regent of France. On 2 June 1420 at Troyes Cathedral, Henry married Catherine, daughter of Charles VI. They had only one son, Henry, born on 6 December 1421 at Windsor Castle. From June to July 1420, Henry V&#x27;s army besieged and took the military fortress castle at Montereau-Fault-Yonne close to Paris. He besieged and captured Melun in November 1420, returning to England shortly thereafter. In 1428, Charles VII retook Montereau, only to see the English once again take it over within a short time. Finally, on 10 October 1437, Charles VII was victorious in regaining Montereau-Fault-Yonne.

While Henry was in England, his brother Thomas, Duke of Clarence, led the English forces in France. On 22 March 1421, Thomas led the English to a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Baugé against a Franco-Scottish army. The duke was killed in the battle. On 10 June, Henry sailed back to France to retrieve the situation. It was to be his last military campaign. From July to August, Henry&#x27;s forces besieged and captured Dreux, thus relieving allied forces at Chartres. On 6 October, his forces laid siege to Meaux, capturing it on 11 May 1422.

== Death ==

Henry V died on 31 August 1422 at the Château de Vincennes to the east of Paris. The commonly held view is that Henry V contracted dysentery in the period just after the Siege of Meaux, which ended on 9 May 1422. However, the symptoms and severity of dysentery present themselves fairly quickly and he seems to have been healthy in the weeks following the siege. At the time, speculative causes of his illness also included smallpox, the bacterial infection erysipelas and even leprosy. But there is no doubt he had contracted a serious illness sometime between May and June. Recovering at the castle of Vincennes, by the end of June it seems he was well enough to lead his forces with the intent of engaging the Dauphinist forces at Cosne-sur-Loire. At the outset, he would have been riding in full armour, probably in blistering heat, as the summer of 1422 was extremely hot. He was struck down again, with a debilitating fever, possibly heatstroke or a relapse of his previous illness. Whatever the cause or causes, he would not recover from this final bout of illness. For a few short weeks he was carried around in a litter, and his enemies having retreated, he decided to return to Paris. One story has him trying, one last time, to mount a horse at Charenton and failing. He was taken back to Vincennes, around 10 August, where he died some weeks later. He was 35 years old and had reigned for nine years. Shortly before his death, Henry V named his brother, John, Duke of Bedford, regent of France in the name of his son, Henry VI of England, then only a few months old. Henry V did not live to be crowned King of France himself, as he might confidently have expected after the Treaty of Troyes, because Charles VI, from whom he would have inherited the crown, survived him by two months.

Henry&#x27;s comrade-in-arms and Lord Steward, John Sutton, 1st Baron Dudley, brought Henry&#x27;s body back to England and bore the royal standard at his funeral. Henry V was buried in Westminster Abbey on 7 November 1422.

== Legacy ==
=== Political ===
Henry V&#x27;s death at thirty-five years of age was a political and dynastic turning point for both the kingdoms of England and France. The Lancastrian ruler had been set to rule both realms after Charles VI&#x27;s death, which occurred in October 1422, less than two months after Henry&#x27;s own premature death. This caused his infant son, also called Henry, to ascend the throne as King Henry VI of England, at the age of nine months. Due to the new king&#x27;s age, a regency government was formed by Henry&#x27;s surviving brothers, John, Duke of Bedford, and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. This acted as the sole governing force of England and its possessions in France until Henry VI came of age in 1437. Although for a time this largely proved to be a success, with England achieving their greatest territorial extent in France under the command of Bedford, the later reign of Henry VI saw the majority of the territories held by the English lost or returned to the French, through reconquest or diplomatic secession; English military power in the region eventually ceased to exist. This marked the end of England&#x27;s sustained military success in the Hundred Years&#x27; War, with all their historic possessions and land in France being lost, with the exception of the Pale of Calais, which remained England&#x27;s only foothold in the continent until it was lost in 1558. The loss of land in France was a major contributing factor in causing Henry V&#x27;s heirs and relatives to descend into civil strife and quarrel over the succession of the English crown in ensuing decades, culminating in the Wars of the Roses (1455–1487) between Henry V&#x27;s descendants, the House of Lancaster, and its rival, the House of York.

=== Reputation ===
Henry V is remembered by both his countrymen and his foes as a capable military commander during the war against France and is one of the most renowned monarchs in English and British history. He is largely seen as a symbol of English military might and power, which inspired later kings and queens of England. His effect on English history, culture, and the military is profound. His victory at Agincourt significantly impacted the war against the French and led to the English capturing most of northern France. This led to the Treaty of Troyes in 1420, in which Charles VI of France appointed Henry his successor, although Henry died two months before Charles in October 1422. Henry&#x27;s victories created a national sensation and caused a patriotic fervour among the English people that influenced both the medieval English army and the British army for centuries. His victories against the French during 1417–1422 led to many romanticized depictions of Henry V as a figure of nationalism and patriotism, both in literature and in the works of Shakespeare, and in the film industry in modern times.

Henry V is not only remembered for his military prowess but also for his architectural patronage. He commissioned the building of King&#x27;s College Chapel and Eton College Chapel, and although some of his building works were discontinued after his death, others were continued by his son and successor Henry VI. He also contributed to the founding of the monastery of the Syon Abbey, completed by Henry VI during his lifetime. In the 16th century the monastery was demolished as a result of the growing movement of the English Reformation during the reign of King Henry VIII. Henry V further contributed to the church, as he was forced to put down an anti-church uprising in the form of the Lollard uprising led by the English Lollard leader John Oldcastle in 1414, who had been a friend of Henry V before his rebellion. Henry also faced a coup orchestrated by a relative and prominent noble, Edmund Mortimer, in the Southampton Plot, and in 1415 dealt with a Yorkist conspiracy to overthrow him. After this, during the remainder of his reign, Henry was able to rule without any opposition against him.

=== In popular culture ===
==== In literature ====
Henry V was often a figure of literary imagination and romantic interpretations, often used as a traditional character of a morally great king in the works of many writers, playwrights and dramatists. This is notably so in his depiction in &quot;Henry V,&quot; a play largely based on the life of Henry V by William Shakespeare. This and other plays about Richard II, Henry V&#x27;s father Henry IV and son Henry VI are known as the &quot;Henriad&quot; in Shakespearean scholarship. It depicts the king as a pious but cunning ruler who ventured on a campaign to France to become heir to the French throne. This largely acquainted audiences and the wider population with the king&#x27;s reign and his character as a whole.

In the other depictions of Henry V in literature, he is a character in William Kenrick&#x27;s sequel to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;, known as &quot;Falstaff&#x27;s Wedding&quot;. In the play, Henry plays a minor role. In Georgette Heyer&#x27;s &quot;Simon the Coldheart&quot; Henry also appears as a minor character. In other works, Henry V is the main character such as in &quot;Good King Harry&quot; by Denise Giardina. He is also a minor character in &quot;Azincourt&quot; by Bernard Cornwell.

==== In film and television ====
Henry V has been depicted in many historical films and operas such as Laurence Olivier&#x27;s 1944 film &quot;Henry V&quot; played by Olivier himself, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Henry also appears in the 1935 film &quot;Royal Cavalcade&quot;, in which he was played by actor Matheson Lang. Henry is played by Kenneth Branagh in the 1989 film &quot;Henry V&quot;, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, Best Director, and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Henry V appears as a major character played by Keith Baxter in Orson Welles&#x27;s 1966 film &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot;. He is also played by Timothée Chalamet in 2019 Netflix film &quot;The King&quot; directed by David Michôd. He is portrayed by Tom Hiddleston in the BBC television series &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot;.

==== In comics and video games ====
Henry V is a character in the comic series &quot;The Hammer Man&quot; in the BBC comic strip &quot;The Victor&quot; featuring him as the commander of the hero, Chell Paddock. King Henry V is a character in the video game &quot;&quot; and also in the &quot;Age of Empires II: The Conquerors&quot; in which he was featured as a paladin.

== Arms ==
Henry&#x27;s arms as Prince of Wales were those of the kingdom, differenced by a label argent of three points. Upon his accession, he inherited the use of the arms of the kingdom undifferenced.

== Marriage ==
After his father became king, Henry was created Prince of Wales. It was suggested that Henry should marry the widow of Richard II, Isabella of Valois, but this had been refused. After this, negotiations took place for his marriage to Catherine of Pomerania between 1401 and 1404, but ultimately failed.

During the following years, marriage had apparently assumed a lower priority until the conclusion of the Treaty of Troyes in 1420 when Henry V was named heir to Charles VI of France and provided in marriage to Charles&#x27;s daughter Catherine of Valois, younger sister of Isabella of Valois. Her dowry, upon the agreement between the two kingdoms, was 600,000 crowns. Together the couple had one child, Henry, born in late 1421. Upon Henry V&#x27;s death in 1422, the infant prince became King Henry VI of England.

<text>The Strepsiptera () are an order of insects with eleven extant families that include about 600 described species. They are endoparasites of other insects, such as bees, wasps, leafhoppers, silverfish, and cockroaches. Females of most species never emerge from the host after entering its body, finally dying inside it. The early-stage larvae do emerge because they must find an unoccupied living host, and the short-lived males must emerge to seek a receptive female in her host. They are believed to be most closely related to beetles, from which they diverged 300–350 million years ago, but do not appear in the fossil record until the mid-Cretaceous around 100 million years ago.

The order is not well known to non-specialists, and the nearest they have to a common name is stylops, in reference to the genus &quot;Stylops&quot;. The name of the order translates to &quot;twisted wing&quot;, giving rise to other common names used for the order, twisted-wing insects and twisted-winged parasites.

Adult males are rarely observed, although specimens may be lured using cages containing virgin females. Nocturnal specimens can also be collected at light traps.

==Biology==

=== Appearance and structure ===

==== Males ====
Males of the Strepsiptera have wings, legs, eyes, and antennae, though their mouthparts cannot be used for feeding. Many have mouthparts modified into sensory structures. The males bear a superficial resemblance to flies. The forewings are modified into small club-shaped structures called halteres, which sense gyroscopic information. A similar organ exists in flies, though in that group the hindwings are modified instead, and the two groups are thought to have independently evolved the structures. The hindwings are generally fan-shaped, and have strongly reduced venation. The antennae are flabellate, and are covered in specialised chemoreceptors, likely to detect females over long distances.

Adult male Strepsiptera have eyes unlike those of any other insect, resembling the eyes found in the trilobite group Phacopina. Instead of a compound eye consisting of hundreds to thousands of ommatidia, that each produce a pixel of the entire image, the strepsipteran eyes consist of only a few dozen &quot;eyelets&quot; that each produce a complete image. These eyelets are separated by cuticle and/or setae, giving the cluster eye as a whole a blackberry-like appearance.

==== Females ====
The females of Stylopidia, which includes 97% of all described strepsipteran species and all modern strepsipteran families except Mengenillidae and Bahiaxenidae, are not known to leave their hosts and are neotenic in form, lacking wings, legs, and eyes, but have a well sclerotised cephalothorax (fused head and thorax). Adult female mengenillids are wingless but are free living and somewhat mobile with legs and small eyes. This is probably also true for the bahiaxenids, though this has not been observed.

==== Larvae ====
Newly hatched primary (first instar) larvae are on average in length, smaller than many single-celled organisms. They are highly mobile with well developed stemmata, which are able to distinguish color. The underside of the body is covered in minute hair-like structures (microtrichia), which allow the larvae to stick to wet surfaces via capillary action. At the back of the body are well developed large bristle-like cerci, which are attached to muscles, which allow the larvae to jump. The tarsal segment of their legs have structures which allow them to cling to their hosts. Later larval instars which develop inside the host are completely immobile.

=== Life cycle ===
Virgin females release a pheromone which the males use to locate them. Mating in at least some species is polyandrous, where the female mates with more than one male.

In the Stylopidia, the female&#x27;s anterior region protrudes out between the segments of the host&#x27;s abdomen. In all strepsipterans the male mates by rupturing the female&#x27;s cuticle (in the case of Stylopidia, this is in a deep narrow fissure of the cephalothorax near the birth canal). Sperm passes through the opening directly into the body in a process called traumatic insemination, which has independently evolved in some other insects like bed bugs.

Strepsiptera eggs hatch inside the female, and the planidium larvae can move around freely within the female&#x27;s haemocoel; this behavior is unique to these insects. The offspring consume their mother from the inside in a process known as haemocoelous viviparity. Each female produces many thousands of planidium larvae. The larvae emerge from the brood opening/canal on the female&#x27;s head, which protrudes outside the host body.

Larvae have legs and actively seek out new hosts. Their legs are partly vestigial in that they lack a trochanter, the leg segment that forms the articulation between the basal coxa and the femur. The larvae are very active as they only have a limited amount of time to find a host before they exhaust their energy reserves. These first-instar larvae have stemmata (simple, single-lens eyes). When the larvae latch onto a host, they enter it by secreting enzymes that soften the cuticle, usually in the abdominal region of the host. Some species have been reported to enter the eggs of hosts. Larvae of &quot;Stichotrema dallatorreanum&quot; Hofeneder from Papua New Guinea were found to enter their orthopteran host&#x27;s tarsus (foot).

Once inside the host, they undergo hypermetamorphosis and transform into a less-mobile, legless larval form. They induce the host to produce a bag-like structure inside which they feed and grow. This structure, made from host tissue, protects them from the immune defences of the host. Larvae go through four more instars, and in each moult the older cuticle separates but is not discarded (&quot;apolysis without ecdysis&quot;), so multiple layers form around the larvae. Male larvae pupate after the last moult, but females directly become neotenous adults. The colour and shape of the host&#x27;s abdomen may be changed and the host usually becomes sterile. The parasites then undergo pupation to become adults. Adult males emerge from the host bodies, while females stay inside. Females may occupy up to 90% of the abdominal volume of their hosts. Adult males are very short-lived, usually surviving less than five hours, and do not feed.

=== Parasitism ===
Strepsiptera of various species have been documented to attack hosts in many orders, including members of the orders Zygentoma (silverfish and allies), Orthoptera (grasshoppers, crickets), Blattodea (cockroaches), Mantodea (praying mantis), Heteroptera (bugs), Hymenoptera (wasps, ants and bees), and Diptera (flies). In the strepsipteran family Myrmecolacidae, the males parasitize ants, while the females parasitize Orthoptera. Members of Mengenillidae target Zygentoma exclusively, while Stylopidia targets only winged insects, with a large number of stylopidians targeting wasps and bees, while the largest family of strepsipterans, the Stylopidae, with over 27% of all described strepsipterans, targets bees exclusively.

Very rarely, multiple females may live within a single stylopized host; multiple males within a single host are somewhat more common.

Strepsiptera of the family Myrmecolacidae can influence their host&#x27;s behaviour, causing their ant hosts to linger on the tips of grass leaves, increasing the chance of being found by strepsipteran males (in the case of females) and putting them in a good position for male emergence (in the case of males).

==Taxonomy==

The order, named by William Kirby in 1813, is named for the hindwings, which are held at a twisted angle when at rest (from Greek (), to twist; and (), wing). The forewings are reduced to halteres.

Strepsiptera were once believed to be the sister group to the beetle families Meloidae and Ripiphoridae, which have similar parasitic development and forewing reduction. Early molecular research suggested their inclusion as a sister group to the flies, in a clade called Halteria, which have one pair of the wings modified into halteres, and failed to support their relationship to the beetles. Further molecular studies, however, suggested they are outside the clade Mecopterida (containing the Diptera and Lepidoptera), but found no strong evidence for affinity with any other extant group. Study of their evolutionary position has been problematic due to difficulties in phylogenetic analysis arising from long branch attraction. Most modern molecular studies find strepsipterans as the sister group of beetles (Coleoptera), with both groups together forming the clade Coleopterida. The most basal strepsipteran is the fossil &quot;Protoxenos janzeni&quot; discovered in Eocene aged Baltic amber, while the most basal living strepsipteran is &quot;Bahiaxenos relictus&quot;, the sole member of the family Bahiaxenidae. The earliest known strepsipteran fossils are those of &quot;Cretostylops engeli&quot; (Cretostylopdiae) and &quot;Kinzelbachilla ellenbergeri&quot;, &quot;Phthanoxenos nervosus&quot; and &quot;Heterobathmilla kakopoios&quot; (Phthanoxenidae), discovered in middle Cretaceous Burmese amber from Myanmar, around 99 million years old, which all lie outside the crown group, but are all more closely related to modern strepsiperans than &quot;Protoxenos&quot; is. The finding of a parasitic first instar in the same deposit indicates that the parasitic lifestyle of the group has likely existed nearly unchanged for 100 million years, though their evolutionary history prior to this remains a mystery. The idea that mengellinids&#x27; targeting of zygentomans represents the ancestral ecology of the group as a whole has been considered questionable.
===Families===

The vast majority of living strepispterans are placed within the grouping Stylopidia, which includes the families Corioxenidae, Halictophagidae, Callipharixenidae, Bohartillidae, Elenchidae, Myrmecolacidae, Stylopidae, Protelencholacidae (extinct) and Xenidae. All Stylopidia have endoparasitic females having multiple genital openings. Two living families, Mengenillidae and Bahiaxenidae, are placed outside of this group, along with several extinct families.

The Stylopidae have four-segmented tarsi and four- to six-segmented antennae, with the third segment having a lateral process. The family Stylopidae may be paraphyletic. The Elenchidae have two-segmented tarsi and four-segmented antennae, with the third segment having a lateral process. The Halictophagidae have three-segmented tarsi and seven-segmented antennae, with lateral processes from the third and fourth segments.
The Stylopidae mostly parasitize wasps and bees, the Elenchidae are known to parasitize Fulgoroidea, while the Halictophagidae are found on leafhoppers, treehoppers, and mole cricket hosts.

Strepsipteran insects in the genus &quot;Xenos&quot; parasitize &quot;Polistes carnifex&quot;, a species of social wasps. These obligate parasites infect the developing wasp larvae in the nest and are present within the abdomens of female wasps when they hatch out. Here they remain until they thrust through the cuticle and pupate (males) or release infective first-instar larvae onto flowers (females). These larvae are transported back to their nests by foraging wasps.

==Relationship with humans==
Some insects which have been considered pests may have strepsipteran endoparasites. Inoculation of a pest population with the corresponding parasitoid may sometimes aid in reducing the impact of such pests, although no strepsipterans have ever been tested for use in this capacity, let alone being available for such purposes, either commercially or experimentally.

<text>Surgery is a medical specialty that uses manual and instrumental techniques to diagnose or treat pathological conditions (e.g., trauma, disease, injury, malignancy), to alter bodily functions (e.g., malabsorption created by bariatric surgery such as gastric bypass), to reconstruct or alter aesthetics and appearance (cosmetic surgery), or to remove unwanted tissues (body fat, glands, scars or skin tags) or foreign bodies.

The act of performing surgery may be called a surgical procedure or surgical operation, or simply &quot;surgery&quot; or &quot;operation&quot;. In this context, the verb &quot;operate&quot; means to perform surgery. The adjective surgical means pertaining to surgery; e.g. surgical instruments, surgical facility or surgical nurse. Most surgical procedures are performed by a pair of operators: a surgeon who is the main operator performing the surgery, and a surgical assistant who provides in-procedure manual assistance during surgery. Modern surgical operations typically require a surgical team that typically consists of the surgeon, the surgical assistant, an anaesthetist (often also complemented by an anaesthetic nurse), a scrub nurse (who handles sterile equipment), a circulating nurse and a surgical technologist, while procedures that mandate cardiopulmonary bypass will also have a perfusionist. All surgical procedures are considered &quot;invasive&quot; and often require a period of &quot;postoperative&quot; care (sometimes intensive care) for the patient to recover from the iatrogenic trauma inflicted by the procedure. The duration of surgery can span from several minutes to tens of hours depending on the specialty, the nature of the condition, the target s involved and the circumstance of each procedure, but most surgeries are designed to be one-off interventions that are typically not intended as an ongoing or repeated type of treatment.

In British colloquialism, the term &quot;surgery&quot; can also refer to the facility where surgery is performed, or simply the office/clinic of a physician, dentist or veterinarian.

== Definitions ==

As a general rule, a procedure is considered surgical when it involves cutting of a person&#x27;s tissues or closure of a previously sustained wound. Other procedures that do not necessarily fall under this rubric, such as angioplasty or endoscopy, may be considered surgery if they involve &quot;common&quot; surgical procedure or settings, such as use of antiseptic measures and sterile fields, sedation/anesthesia, proactive hemostasis, typical surgical instruments, suturing or stapling. All forms of surgery are considered invasive procedures; the so-called &quot;noninvasive surgery&quot; ought to be more appropriately called minimally invasive procedures, which usually refers to a procedure that utilizes natural orifices (e.g. most urological procedures) or does not penetrate the structure being excised (e.g. endoscopic polyp excision, rubber band ligation, laser eye surgery), are percutaneous (e.g. arthroscopy, catheter ablation, angioplasty and valvuloplasty), or to a radiosurgical procedure (e.g. irradiation of a tumor).

===Types of surgery===
Surgical procedures are commonly categorized by urgency, type of procedure, body system involved, the degree of invasiveness, and special instrumentation.
* Based on timing:
** Elective surgery is done to correct a non-life-threatening condition, and is carried out at the person&#x27;s convenience, or to the surgeon&#x27;s and the surgical facility&#x27;s availability.
** Semi-elective surgery is one that is better done early to avoid complications or potential deterioration of the patient&#x27;s condition, but such risk are sufficiently low that the procedure can be postponed for a short period time.
** Emergency surgery is surgery which must be done without any delay to prevent death or serious disabilities or loss of limbs and functions.
* Based on purpose:
** Exploratory surgery is performed to establish or aid a diagnosis.
** Therapeutic surgery is performed to treat a previously diagnosed condition.
*** Curative surgery is a therapeutic procedure done to permanently remove a pathology.
** Plastic surgery is done to improve a body part&#x27;s function or appearance. 
*** Reconstructive plastic surgery is done to improve the function or subjective appearance of a damaged or malformed body part.
*** Cosmetic surgery is done to subjectively improve the appearance of an otherwise normal body part.
** Bariatric surgery is done to assist weight loss when dietary and pharmaceutical methods alone have failed.
** Non-survival surgery, or terminal surgery, is where Euthanasia is performed while the subject is under Anesthesia so that the subject will not regain conscious pain perception. This type of surgery is usually done in Animal testing experiments.

* By type of procedure:
** Amputation involves removing an entire , usually a limb or digit; castration is the amputation of testes; circumcision is the removal of prepuce from the penis or clitoral hood from the clitoris (see female circumcision). Replantation involves reattaching a severed body part.
** Resection is the removal of all or part of an internal organ and/or connective tissue. A segmental resection specifically removes an independent vascular region of an organ such as a hepatic segment, a bronchopulmonary segment or a renal lobe. Excision is the resection of only part of an organ, tissue or other body part (e.g. skin) without discriminating specific vascular territories. Exenteration is the complete removal of all organs and soft tissue content (especially lymphoid tissues) within a body cavity.
** Extirpation is the complete excision or surgical destruction of a body part.
** Ablation is destruction of tissue through the use of energy-transmitting devices such as electrocautery/fulguration, laser, focused ultrasound or freezing.
** Repair involves the direct closure or restoration of an injured, mutilated or deformed organ or body part, usually by suturing or internal fixation. Reconstruction is an extensive repair of a complex body part (such as joints), often with some degrees of structural/functional replacement and commonly involves grafting and/or use of implants.
** Grafting is the relocation and establishment of a tissue from one part of the body to another. A flap is the relocation of a tissue without complete separation of its original attachment, and a free flap is a completely detached flap that carries an intact neurovascular structure ready for grafting onto a new location.
** Bypass involves the relocation/grafting of a tubular structure onto another in order to reroute the content flow of that target structure from a specific segment directly to a more distal (&quot;downstream&quot;) segment.
** Implantation is insertion of artificial medical devices to replace or augment existing tissue.
** Transplantation is the replacement of an organ or body part by insertion of another from a different human (or animal) into the person undergoing surgery. Harvesting is the resection of an organ or body part from a live human or animal (known as the &quot;donor&quot;) for transplantation into another patient (known as the &quot;recipient&quot;).
* By organ system: Surgical specialties are traditionally and academically categorized by the organ, organ system or body region involved. Examples include:
** Cardiac surgery — the heart and mediastinal great vessels;
** Thoracic surgery — the thoracic cavity including the lungs;
** Gastrointestinal surgery — the digestive tract and its accessory organs;
** Vascular surgery — the extra-mediastinal great vessels and peripheral circulatory system;
** Urological surgery — the genitourinary system;
** ENT surgery — ear, nose and throat, also known as head and neck surgery when including the neck region;
** Oral and maxillofacial surgery — the oral cavity, jaws, and face;
** Neurosurgery — the central nervous system, and;
** Orthopedic surgery — the musculoskeletal system.
* By degree of invasiveness of surgical procedures:
** Conventional open surgery (such as a laparotomy) requires a large incision to access the area of interest, and directly exposes the internal body cavity to the outside.
** Minimally-invasive surgery involves much smaller surface incisions or even natural orifices (nostril, mouth, anus or urethra) to insert miniaturized instruments within a body cavity or structure, as in laparoscopic surgery or angioplasty.
** Hybrid surgery uses a combination of open and minimally-invasive techniques, and may include hand ports or larger incisions to assist with performance of elements of the procedure.
* By equipment used:
** Laser surgery involves use of laser ablation to divide tissue instead of a scalpel, scissors or similar sharp-edged instruments.
** Cryosurgery uses low-temperature cryoablation to freeze and destroy a target tissue.
** Electrosurgery involves use of electrocautery to cut and coagulate tissue.
** Microsurgery involves the use of an operating microscope for the surgeon to see and manipulate small structures.
** Endoscopic surgery uses optical instruments to relay the image from inside an enclosed body cavity to the outside, and the surgeon performs the procedure using specialized handheld instruments inserted through trocars placed through the body wall. Most modern endoscopic procedures are &quot;video-assisted&quot;, meaning the images are viewed on a display screen rather than through the eyepiece on the endoscope.
** Robotic surgery makes use of robotics such as the Da Vinci or the ZEUS robotic surgical systems, to remotely control endoscopic or minimally-invasive instruments.

===Terminology===

* Resection and excisional procedures start with a prefix for the target organ to be excised (cut out) and end in the suffix -ectomy. For example, removal of part of the stomach would be called a subtotal gastrectomy.
* Procedures involving cutting into an organ or tissue end in -otomy. A surgical procedure cutting through the abdominal wall to gain access to the abdominal cavity is a laparotomy.
* Minimally invasive procedures, involving small incisions through which an endoscope is inserted, end in -oscopy. For example, such surgery in the abdominal cavity is called laparoscopy.
* Procedures for formation of a permanent or semi-permanent opening called a stoma in the body end in -ostomy, such as creation of a colostomy, a connection of colon and the abdominal wall. This prefix is also used for connection between two viscera, such as how an esophagojejunostomy refers to a connection created between the esophagus and the jejunum.
* Plastic and reconstruction procedures start with the name for the body part to be reconstructed and end in -plasty. For example, &quot;rhino-&quot; is a prefix meaning &quot;nose&quot;, therefore a &quot;rhinoplasty&quot; is a reconstructive or cosmetic surgery for the nose. A pyloroplasty refers to a type of reconstruction of the gastric pylorus.
* Procedures that involve cutting the muscular layers of an organ end in -myotomy. A pyloromyotomy refers to cutting the muscular layers of the gastric pylorus.
* Repair of a damaged or abnormal structure ends in -orraphy. This includes herniorrhaphy, another name for a hernia repair.
* Reoperation, revision, or &quot;redo&quot; procedures refer to a planned or unplanned return to the operating theater after a surgery is performed to re-address an aspect of patient care. Unplanned reasons for reoperation include postoperative complications such as bleeding or hematoma formation, development of a seroma or abscess, anastomotic leak, tissue necrosis requiring debridement or excision, or in the case of malignancy, close or involved resection margins that may require re-excision to avoid local recurrence. Reoperation can be performed in the acute phase, or it can be also performed months to years later if the surgery failed to solve the indicated problem. Reoperation can also be planned as a staged operation where components of the procedure are performed or reversed under separate anesthesia.

== Description of surgical procedure ==
=== Setting ===
Inpatient surgery is performed in a hospital, and the person undergoing surgery stays at least one night in the hospital after the surgery. Outpatient surgery occurs in a hospital outpatient department or freestanding ambulatory surgery center, and the person who had surgery is discharged the same working day. Office-based surgery occurs in a physician&#x27;s office, and the person is discharged the same day.

At a hospital, modern surgery is often performed in an operating theater using surgical instruments, an operating table, and other equipment. Among United States hospitalizations for non-maternal and non-neonatal conditions in 2012, more than one-fourth of stays and half of hospital costs involved stays that included operating room (OR) procedures. The environment and procedures used in surgery are governed by the principles of aseptic technique: the strict separation of &quot;sterile&quot; (free of microorganisms) things from &quot;unsterile&quot; or &quot;contaminated&quot; things. All surgical instruments must be sterilized, and an instrument must be replaced or re-sterilized if it becomes contaminated (i.e. handled in an unsterile manner, or allowed to touch an unsterile surface). Operating room staff must wear sterile attire (scrubs, a scrub cap, a sterile surgical gown, sterile latex or non-latex polymer gloves and a surgical mask), and they must scrub hands and arms with an approved disinfectant agent before each procedure.

=== Preoperative care ===

Prior to surgery, the person is given a medical examination, receives certain pre-operative tests, and their physical status is rated according to the ASA physical status classification system. If these results are satisfactory, the person requiring surgery signs a consent form and is given a surgical clearance. If the procedure is expected to result in significant blood loss, an autologous blood donation may be made some weeks prior to surgery. If the surgery involves the digestive system, the person requiring surgery may be instructed to perform a bowel prep by drinking a solution of polyethylene glycol the night before the procedure. People preparing for surgery are also instructed to abstain from food or drink (an NPO order after midnight on the night before the procedure), to minimize the effect of stomach contents on pre-operative medications and reduce the risk of aspiration if the person vomits during or after the procedure.

Some medical systems have a practice of routinely performing chest x-rays before surgery. The premise behind this practice is that the physician might discover some unknown medical condition which would complicate the surgery, and that upon discovering this with the chest x-ray, the physician would adapt the surgery practice accordingly. However, medical specialty professional organizations recommend against routine pre-operative chest x-rays for people who have an unremarkable medical history and presented with a physical exam which did not indicate a chest x-ray. Routine x-ray examination is more likely to result in problems like misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or other negative outcomes than it is to result in a benefit to the person. Likewise, other tests including complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, basic metabolic panel, and urinalysis should not be done unless the results of these tests can help evaluate surgical risk.

===Preparing for surgery===

A surgical team may include a surgeon, anesthetist, a circulating nurse, and a &quot;scrub tech&quot;, or surgical technician, as well as other assistants who provide equipment and supplies as required. While informed consent discussions may be performed in a clinic or acute care setting, the pre-operative holding area is where documentation is reviewed and where family members can also meet the surgical team. Nurses in the preoperative holding area confirm orders and answer additional questions of the family members of the patient prior to surgery. In the pre-operative holding area, the person preparing for surgery changes out of their street clothes and are asked to confirm the details of his or her surgery as previously discussed during the process of informed consent. A set of vital signs are recorded, a peripheral IV line is placed, and pre-operative medications (antibiotics, sedatives, etc.) are given.

When the patient enters the operating room and is appropriately anesthetized, the team will then position the patient in an appropriate surgical position. If hair is present at the surgical site, it is clipped (instead of shaving). The skin surface within the operating field is cleansed and prepared by applying an antiseptic (typically chlorhexidine gluconate in alcohol, as this is twice as effective as povidone-iodine at reducing the risk of infection). Sterile drapes are then used to cover the borders of the operating field. Depending on the type of procedure, the cephalad drapes are secured to a pair of poles near the head of the bed to form an &quot;ether screen&quot;, which separate the anesthetist/anesthesiologist&#x27;s working area (unsterile) from the surgical site (sterile).

Anesthesia is administered to prevent pain from the trauma of cutting, tissue manipulation, application of thermal energy, and suturing. Depending on the type of operation, anesthesia may be provided locally, regionally, or as general anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia may be used when the surgical site is too large or deep for a local block, but general anesthesia may not be desirable. With local and spinal anesthesia, the surgical site is anesthetized, but the person can remain conscious or minimally sedated. In contrast, general anesthesia may render the person unconscious and paralyzed during surgery. The person is typically intubated to protect their airway and placed on a mechanical ventilator, and anesthesia is produced by a combination of injected and inhaled agents. The choice of surgical method and anesthetic technique aims to solve the indicated problem, minimize the risk of complications, optimize the time needed for recovery, and limit the surgical stress response.

===Intraoperative phase===
The intraoperative phase begins when the surgery subject is received in the surgical area (such as the operating theater or surgical department), and lasts until the subject is transferred to a recovery area (such as a post-anesthesia care unit).

An incision is made to access the surgical site. Blood vessels may be clamped or cauterized to prevent bleeding, and retractors may be used to expose the site or keep the incision open. The approach to the surgical site may involve several layers of incision and dissection, as in abdominal surgery, where the incision must traverse skin, subcutaneous tissue, three layers of muscle and then the peritoneum. In certain cases, bone may be cut to further access the interior of the body; for example, cutting the skull for brain surgery or cutting the sternum for thoracic (chest) surgery to open up the rib cage. Whilst in surgery aseptic technique is used to prevent infection or further spreading of the disease. The surgeons&#x27; and assistants&#x27; hands, wrists and forearms are washed thoroughly for at least 4 minutes to prevent germs getting into the operative field, then sterile gloves are placed onto their hands. An antiseptic solution is applied to the area of the person&#x27;s body that will be operated on. Sterile drapes are placed around the operative site. Surgical masks are worn by the surgical team to avoid germs on droplets of liquid from their mouths and noses from contaminating the operative site.

Work to correct the problem in body then proceeds. This work may involve:

* excision – cutting out an organ, tumor, or other tissue.
* resection – partial removal of an organ or other bodily structure.
* reconnection of organs, tissues, etc., particularly if severed. Resection of organs such as intestines involves reconnection. Internal suturing or stapling may be used. Surgical connection between blood vessels or other tubular or hollow structures such as loops of intestine is called anastomosis.
* reduction – the movement or realignment of a body part to its normal position. e.g. Reduction of a broken nose involves the physical manipulation of the bone or cartilage from their displaced state back to their original position to restore normal airflow and aesthetics.
* ligation – tying off blood vessels, ducts, or &quot;tubes&quot;.
* grafts – may be severed pieces of tissue cut from the same (or different) body or flaps of tissue still partly connected to the body but resewn for rearranging or restructuring of the area of the body in question. Although grafting is often used in cosmetic surgery, it is also used in other surgery. Grafts may be taken from one area of the person&#x27;s body and inserted to another area of the body. An example is bypass surgery, where clogged blood vessels are bypassed with a graft from another part of the body. Alternatively, grafts may be from other persons, cadavers, or animals.
* insertion of prosthetic parts when needed. Pins or screws to set and hold bones may be used. Sections of bone may be replaced with prosthetic rods or other parts. Sometimes a plate is inserted to replace a damaged area of skull. Artificial hip replacement has become more common. Heart pacemakers or valves may be inserted. Many other types of prostheses are used.
* creation of a stoma, a permanent or semi-permanent opening in the body
* in transplant surgery, the donor organ (taken out of the donor&#x27;s body) is inserted into the recipient&#x27;s body and reconnected to the recipient in all necessary ways (blood vessels, ducts, etc.).
* arthrodesis – surgical connection of adjacent bones so the bones can grow together into one. Spinal fusion is an example of adjacent vertebrae connected allowing them to grow together into one piece.
* modifying the digestive tract in bariatric surgery for weight loss.
* repair of a fistula, hernia, or prolapse.
* repair according to the ICD-10-PCS, in the Medical and Surgical Section 0, root operation Q, means restoring, to the extent possible, a body part to its normal anatomic structure and function. This definition, repair, is used only when the method used to accomplish the repair is not one of the other root operations. Examples would be colostomy takedown, herniorrhaphy of a hernia, and the surgical suture of a laceration.
* other procedures, including:
:*clearing clogged ducts, blood or other vessels
:*removal of calculi (stones)
:*draining of accumulated fluids
:*debridement – removal of dead, damaged, or diseased tissue
Blood or blood expanders may be administered to compensate for blood lost during surgery. Once the procedure is complete, sutures or staples are used to close the incision. Once the incision is closed, the anesthetic agents are stopped or reversed, and the person is taken off ventilation and (if general anesthesia was administered).

===Postoperative care===
After completion of surgery, the person is transferred to the post anesthesia care unit and closely monitored. When the person is judged to have recovered from the anesthesia, he/she is either transferred to a surgical ward elsewhere in the hospital or discharged home. During the post-operative period, the person&#x27;s general function is assessed, the outcome of the procedure is assessed, and the surgical site is checked for signs of infection. There are several risk factors associated with postoperative complications, such as immune deficiency and obesity. Obesity has long been considered a risk factor for adverse post-surgical outcomes. It has been linked to many disorders such as obesity hypoventilation syndrome, atelectasis and pulmonary embolism, adverse cardiovascular effects, and wound healing complications. If removable skin closures are used, they are removed after 7 to 10 days post-operatively, or after healing of the incision is well under way.

It is not uncommon for surgical drains to be required to remove blood or fluid from the surgical wound during recovery. Mostly these drains stay in until the volume tapers off, then they are removed. These drains can become clogged, leading to abscess.

Postoperative therapy may include adjuvant treatment such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or administration of medication such as anti-rejection medication for transplants. For postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), solutions like saline, water, controlled breathing placebo and aromatherapy can be used in addition to medication. Other follow-up studies or rehabilitation may be prescribed during and after the recovery period. A recent post-operative care philosophy has been early ambulation. Ambulation is getting the patient moving around. This can be as simple as sitting up or even walking around. The goal is to get the patient moving as early as possible. It has been found to shorten the patient&#x27;s length of stay. Length of stay is the amount of time a patient spends in the hospital after surgery before they are discharged. In a recent study done with lumbar decompressions, the patient&#x27;s length of stay was decreased by 1–3 days.

The use of topical antibiotics on surgical wounds to reduce infection rates has been questioned. Antibiotic ointments are likely to irritate the skin, slow healing, and could increase risk of developing contact dermatitis and antibiotic resistance. It has also been suggested that topical antibiotics should only be used when a person shows signs of infection and not as a preventative. A systematic review published by Cochrane (organisation) in 2016, though, concluded that topical antibiotics applied over certain types of surgical wounds reduce the risk of surgical site infections, when compared to no treatment or use of antiseptics. The review also did not find conclusive evidence to suggest that topical antibiotics increased the risk of local skin reactions or antibiotic resistance.

Through a retrospective analysis of national administrative data, the association between mortality and day of elective surgical procedure suggests a higher risk in procedures carried out later in the working week and on weekends. The odds of death were 44% and 82% higher respectively when comparing procedures on a Friday to a weekend procedure. This &quot;weekday effect&quot; has been postulated to be from several factors including poorer availability of services on a weekend, and also, decrease number and level of experience over a weekend.

Postoperative pain affects an estimated 80% of people who underwent surgery. While pain is expected after surgery, there is growing evidence that pain may be inadequately treated in many people in the acute period immediately after surgery. It has been reported that incidence of inadequately controlled pain after surgery ranged from 25.1% to 78.4% across all surgical disciplines. There is insufficient evidence to determine if giving opioid pain medication pre-emptively (before surgery) reduces postoperative pain the amount of medication needed after surgery.

Postoperative recovery has been defined as an energy‐requiring process to decrease physical symptoms, reach a level of emotional well‐being, regain functions, and re‐establish activities. Moreover, it has been identified that patients who have undergone surgery are often not fully recovered on discharge.

==Epidemiology==
===United States===

In 2011, of the 38.6 million hospital stays in U.S. hospitals, 29% included at least one operating room procedure. These stays accounted for 48% of the total $387 billion in hospital costs.

The overall number of procedures remained stable from 2001 to 2011. In 2011, over 15 million operating room procedures were performed in U.S. hospitals.

Data from 2003 to 2011 showed that U.S. hospital costs were highest for the surgical service line; the surgical service line costs were $17,600 in 2003 and projected to be $22,500 in 2013. For hospital stays in 2012 in the United States, private insurance had the highest percentage of surgical expenditure. in 2012, mean hospital costs in the United States were highest for surgical stays.

==Special populations==

===Elderly people===
Older adults have widely varying physical health. Frail elderly people are at significant risk of post-surgical complications and the need for extended care. Assessment of older people before elective surgery can accurately predict the person&#x27;s recovery trajectories. One frailty scale uses five items: unintentional weight loss, muscle weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slowed walking speed. A healthy person scores 0; a very frail person scores 5. Compared to non-frail elderly people, people with intermediate frailty scores (2 or 3) are twice as likely to have post-surgical complications, spend 50% more time in the hospital, and are three times as likely to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility instead of to their own homes. People who are frail and elderly (score of 4 or 5) have even worse outcomes, with the risk of being discharged to a nursing home rising to twenty times the rate for non-frail elderly people.

===Children===
Surgery on children requires considerations that are not common in adult surgery. Children and adolescents are still developing physically and mentally making it difficult for them to make informed decisions and give consent for surgical treatments. Bariatric surgery in youth is among the controversial topics related to surgery in children.
===Vulnerable populations===
Doctors perform surgery with the consent of the person undergoing surgery. Some people are able to give better informed consent than others. Populations such as incarcerated persons, people living with dementia, the mentally incompetent, persons subject to coercion, and other people who are not able to make decisions with the same authority as others, have special needs when making decisions about their personal healthcare, including surgery.

==Global surgery==
Global surgery has been defined as &#x27;the multidisciplinary enterprise of providing improved and equitable surgical care to the world&#x27;s population, with its core belief as the issues of need, access and quality&quot;. Halfdan T. Mahler, the 3rd Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), first brought attention to the disparities in surgery and surgical care in 1980 when he stated in his address to the World Congress of the International College of Surgeons, &quot;&#x27;the vast majority of the world&#x27;s population has no access whatsoever to skilled surgical care and little is being done to find a solution.As such, surgical care globally has been described as the &#x27;neglected stepchild of global health,&#x27; a term coined by Paul Farmer to highlight the urgent need for further work in this area. Furthermore, Jim Young Kim, the former President of the World Bank, proclaimed in 2014 that &quot;surgery is an indivisible, indispensable part of health care and of progress towards universal health coverage.&quot;

In 2015, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery (LCoGS) published the landmark report titled &quot;Global Surgery 2030: evidence and solutions for achieving health, welfare, and economic development&quot;, describing the large, pre-existing burden of surgical diseases in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and future directions for increasing universal access to safe surgery by the year 2030. The Commission highlighted that about 5 billion people lack access to safe and affordable surgical and anesthesia care and 143 million additional procedures were needed every year to prevent further morbidity and mortality from treatable surgical conditions as well as a $12.3 trillion loss in economic productivity by the year 2030. This was especially true in the poorest countries, which account for over one-third of the population but only 3.5% of all surgeries that occur worldwide. It emphasized the need to significantly improve the capacity for Bellwether procedures – laparotomy, caesarean section, open fracture care – which are considered a minimum level of care that first-level hospitals should be able to provide in order to capture the most basic emergency surgical care. In terms of the financial impact on the patients, the lack of adequate surgical and anesthesia care has resulted in 33 million individuals every year facing catastrophic health expenditure – the out-of-pocket healthcare cost exceeding 40% of a given household&#x27;s income.

In alignment with the LCoGS call for action, the World Health Assembly adopted the resolution WHA68.15 in 2015 that stated, &quot;Strengthening emergency and essential surgical care and anesthesia as a component of universal health coverage.&quot; This not only mandated the WHO to prioritize strengthening the surgical and anesthesia care globally, but also led to governments of the member states recognizing the urgent need for increasing capacity in surgery and anesthesia. Additionally, the third edition of Disease Control Priorities (DCP3), published in 2015 by the World Bank, declared surgery as essential and featured an entire volume dedicated to building surgical capacity.

Data from WHO and the World Bank indicate that scaling up infrastructure to enable access to surgical care in regions where it is currently limited or is non-existent is a low-cost measure relative to the significant morbidity and mortality caused by lack of surgical treatment. In fact, a systematic review found that the cost-effectiveness ratio – dollars spent per DALYs averted – for surgical interventions is on par or exceeds those of major public health interventions such as oral rehydration therapy, breastfeeding promotion, and even HIV/AIDS antiretroviral therapy. This finding challenged the common misconception that surgical care is financially prohibitive endeavor not worth pursuing in LMICs.

A key policy framework that arose from this renewed global commitment towards surgical care worldwide is the National Surgical Obstetric and Anesthesia Plan (NSOAP). NSOAP focuses on policy-to-action capacity building for surgical care with tangible steps as follows: (1) analysis of baseline indicators, (2) partnership with local champions, (3) broad stakeholder engagement, (4) consensus building and synthesis of ideas, (5) language refinement, (6) costing, (7) dissemination, and (8) implementation. This approach has been widely adopted and has served as guiding principles between international collaborators and local institutions and governments. Successful implementations have allowed for sustainability in terms of longterm monitoring, quality improvement, and continued political and financial support.

==Human rights==

Access to surgical care is increasingly recognized as an integral aspect of healthcare and therefore is evolving into a normative derivation of human right to health. The ICESCR Article 12.1 and 12.2 define the human right to health as &quot;the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health&quot; In the August 2000, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) interpreted this to mean &quot;right to the enjoyment of a variety of facilities, goods, services, and conditions necessary for the realization of the highest attainable health&quot;. Surgical care can be thereby viewed as a positive right – an entitlement to protective healthcare.

Woven through the International Human and Health Rights literature is the right to be free from surgical disease. The 1966 ICESCR Article 12.2a described the need for &quot;provision for the reduction of the stillbirth-rate and of infant mortality and for the healthy development of the child&quot; which was subsequently interpreted to mean &quot;requiring measures to improve… emergency obstetric services&quot;. Article 12.2d of the ICESCR stipulates the need for &quot;the creation of conditions which would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness&quot;, and is interpreted in the 2000 comment to include timely access to &quot;basic preventative, curative services… for appropriate treatment of injury and disability.&quot;. Obstetric care shares close ties with reproductive rights, which includes access to reproductive health.

Surgeons and public health advocates, such as Kelly McQueen, have described surgery as &quot;Integral to the right to health&quot;. This is reflected in the establishment of the WHO Global Initiative for Emergency and Essential Surgical Care in 2005, the 2013 formation of the Lancet Commission for Global Surgery, the 2015 World Bank Publication of Volume 1 of its Disease Control Priorities Project &quot;Essential Surgery&quot;, and the 2015 World Health Assembly 68.15 passing of the Resolution for Strengthening Emergency and Essential Surgical Care and Anesthesia as a Component of Universal Health Coverage. The Lancet Commission for Global Surgery outlined the need for access to &quot;available, affordable, timely and safe&quot; surgical and anesthesia care; dimensions paralleled in ICESCR General Comment No. 14, which similarly outlines need for available, accessible, affordable and timely healthcare.

==History==

===Trepanation===
Surgical treatments date back to the prehistoric era. The oldest for which there is evidence is trepanation, in which a hole is drilled or scraped into the skull, thus exposing the dura mater in order to treat health problems related to intracranial pressure.

===Ancient Egypt===
Prehistoric surgical techniques are seen in Ancient Egypt, where a mandible dated to approximately 2650 BC shows two perforations just below the root of the first molar, indicating the draining of an abscessed tooth. Surgical texts from ancient Egypt date back about 3500 years ago. Surgical operations were performed by priests, specialized in medical treatments similar to today, and used sutures to close wounds. Infections were treated with honey.

===India===
9,000-year-old skeletal remains of a prehistoric individual from the Indus River valley show evidence of teeth having been drilled. &quot;Sushruta Samhita&quot; is one of the oldest known surgical texts and its period is usually placed in the first millennium BCE. It describes in detail the examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of numerous ailments, as well as procedures for various forms of cosmetic surgery, plastic surgery and rhinoplasty.

=== Sri Lanka ===
In 1982 archaeologists were able to find significant evidence when the ancient land, called &#x27;Alahana Pirivena&#x27; situated in Polonnaruwa, with ruins, was excavated. In that place ruins of an ancient hospital emerged. The hospital building was 147.5 feet in width and 109.2 feet in length. The instruments which were used for complex surgeries were there among the things discovered from the place, including forceps, scissors, probes, lancets, and scalpels. The instruments discovered may be dated to 11th century AD.

===Ancient and Medieval Greece===
In ancient Greece, temples dedicated to the healer-god Asclepius, known as &quot;Asclepieia&quot; (, sing. &quot;Asclepieion&quot; &quot;Ασκληπιείον&quot;), functioned as centers of medical advice, prognosis, and healing. In the Asclepieion of Epidaurus, some of the surgical cures listed, such as the opening of an abdominal abscess or the removal of traumatic foreign material, are realistic enough to have taken place. The Greek Galen was one of the greatest surgeons of the ancient world and performed many audacious operations – including brain and eye surgery – that were not tried again for almost two millennia. Hippocrates stated in the oath () &quot;I will not use the knife, even upon those suffering from stones, but I will leave this to those who are trained in this craft.&quot;

Researchers from the Adelphi University discovered in the Paliokastro on Thasos ten skeletal remains, four women and six men, who were buried between the fourth and seventh centuries A.D. Their bones illuminated their physical activities, traumas, and even a complex form of brain surgery. According to the researchers: &quot;The very serious trauma cases sustained by both males and females had been treated surgically or orthopedically by a very experienced physician/surgeon with great training in trauma care. We believe it to have been a military physician&quot;. The researchers were impressed by the complexity of the brain surgical operation.

In 1991 at the Polystylon fort in Greece, researchers discovered the head of a Byzantine warrior of the 14th century. Analysis of the lower jaw revealed that a surgery has been performed, when the warrior was alive, to the jaw which had been badly fractured and it tied back together until it healed.

===Islamic world===
During the Islamic Golden Age, largely based upon Paul of Aegina&#x27;s &quot;Pragmateia&quot;, the writings of Albucasis (Abu al-Qasim Khalaf ibn al-Abbas Al-Zahrawi), an Andalusian-Arab physician and scientist who practiced in the Zahra suburb of Córdoba, were influential. Al-Zahrawi specialized in curing disease by cauterization. He invented several surgical instruments for purposes such as inspection of the interior of the urethra and for removing foreign bodies from the throat, the ear, and other body organs. He was also the first to illustrate the various cannulae and to treat warts with an iron tube and caustic metal as a boring instrument. He describes what is thought to be the first attempt at reduction mammaplasty for the management of gynaecomastia and the first mastectomy to treat breast cancer. He is credited with the performance of the first thyroidectomy. Al-Zahrawi pioneered techniques of neurosurgery and neurological diagnosis, treating head injuries, skull fractures, spinal injuries, hydrocephalus, subdural effusions and headache. The first clinical description of an operative procedure for hydrocephalus was given by Al-Zahrawi, who clearly describes the evacuation of superficial intracranial fluid in hydrocephalic children.

===Early modern Europe===
In Europe, the demand grew for surgeons to formally study for many years before practicing; universities such as Montpellier, Padua and Bologna were particularly renowned. In the 12th century, Rogerius Salernitanus composed his &quot;Chirurgia&quot;, laying the foundation for modern Western surgical manuals. Barber-surgeons generally had a bad reputation that was not to improve until the development of academic surgery as a specialty of medicine, rather than an accessory field. Basic surgical principles for asepsis etc., are known as Halsteads principles.

There were some important advances to the art of surgery during this period. The professor of anatomy at the University of Padua, Andreas Vesalius, was a pivotal figure in the Renaissance transition from classical medicine and anatomy based on the works of Galen, to an empirical approach of &#x27;hands-on&#x27; dissection. In his anatomic treaties &quot;De humani corporis fabrica&quot;, he exposed the many anatomical errors in Galen and advocated that all surgeons should train by engaging in practical dissections themselves.

The second figure of importance in this era was Ambroise Paré (sometimes spelled &quot;Ambrose&quot;), a French army surgeon from the 1530s until his death in 1590. The practice for cauterizing gunshot wounds on the battlefield had been to use boiling oil; an extremely dangerous and painful procedure. Paré began to employ a less irritating emollient, made of egg yolk, rose oil and turpentine. He also described more efficient techniques for the effective ligation of the blood vessels during an amputation.

===Modern surgery===
The discipline of surgery was put on a sound, scientific footing during the Age of Enlightenment in Europe. An important figure in this regard was the Scottish surgical scientist, John Hunter, generally regarded as the father of modern scientific surgery. He brought an empirical and experimental approach to the science and was renowned around Europe for the quality of his research and his written works. Hunter reconstructed surgical knowledge from scratch; refusing to rely on the testimonies of others, he conducted his own surgical experiments to determine the truth of the matter. To aid comparative analysis, he built up a collection of over 13,000 specimens of separate organ systems, from the simplest plants and animals to humans.

He greatly advanced knowledge of venereal disease and introduced many new techniques of surgery, including new methods for repairing damage to the Achilles tendon and a more effective method for applying ligature of the arteries in case of an aneurysm. He was also one of the first to understand the importance of pathology, the danger of the spread of infection and how the problem of inflammation of the wound, bone lesions and even tuberculosis often undid any benefit that was gained from the intervention. He consequently adopted the position that all surgical procedures should be used only as a last resort.

Other important 18th- and early 19th-century surgeons included Percival Pott (1713–1788) who described tuberculosis on the spine and first demonstrated that a cancer may be caused by an environmental carcinogen (he noticed a connection between chimney sweep&#x27;s exposure to soot and their high incidence of scrotal cancer). Astley Paston Cooper (1768–1841) first performed a successful ligation of the abdominal aorta, and James Syme (1799–1870) pioneered the Symes Amputation for the ankle joint and successfully carried out the first hip disarticulation.

Modern pain control through anesthesia was discovered in the mid-19th century. Before the advent of anesthesia, surgery was a traumatically painful procedure and surgeons were encouraged to be as swift as possible to minimize patient suffering. This also meant that operations were largely restricted to amputations and external growth removals. Beginning in the 1840s, surgery began to change dramatically in character with the discovery of effective and practical anaesthetic chemicals such as ether, first used by the American surgeon Crawford Long, and chloroform, discovered by Scottish obstetrician James Young Simpson and later pioneered by John Snow, physician to Queen Victoria. In addition to relieving patient suffering, anaesthesia allowed more intricate operations in the internal regions of the human body. In addition, the discovery of muscle relaxants such as curare allowed for safer applications.

====Infection and antisepsis====
The introduction of anesthetics encouraged more surgery, which inadvertently caused more dangerous patient post-operative infections. The concept of infection was unknown until relatively modern times. The first progress in combating infection was made in 1847 by the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who noticed that medical students fresh from the dissecting room were causing excess maternal death compared to midwives. Semmelweis, despite ridicule and opposition, introduced compulsory handwashing for everyone entering the maternal wards and was rewarded with a plunge in maternal and fetal deaths; however, the Royal Society dismissed his advice.

Until the pioneering work of British surgeon Joseph Lister in the 1860s, most medical men believed that chemical damage from exposures to bad air (see &quot;miasma&quot;) was responsible for infections in wounds, and facilities for washing hands or a patient&#x27;s wounds were not available. Lister became aware of the work of French chemist Louis Pasteur, who showed that rotting and fermentation could occur under anaerobic conditions if micro-organisms were present. Pasteur suggested three methods to eliminate the micro-organisms responsible for gangrene: filtration, exposure to heat, or exposure to chemical solutions. Lister confirmed Pasteur&#x27;s conclusions with his own experiments and decided to use his findings to develop antiseptic techniques for wounds. As the first two methods suggested by Pasteur were inappropriate for the treatment of human tissue, Lister experimented with the third, spraying carbolic acid on his instruments. He found that this remarkably reduced the incidence of gangrene and he published his results in &quot;The Lancet&quot;. Later, on 9 August 1867, he read a paper before the British Medical Association in Dublin, on the &quot;Antiseptic Principle of the Practice of Surgery&quot;, which was reprinted in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;. His work was groundbreaking and laid the foundations for a rapid advance in infection control that saw modern antiseptic operating theatres widely used within 50 years.

Lister continued to develop improved methods of antisepsis and asepsis when he realised that infection could be better avoided by preventing bacteria from getting into wounds in the first place. This led to the rise of sterile surgery. Lister introduced the Steam Steriliser to sterilize equipment, instituted rigorous hand washing and later implemented the wearing of rubber gloves. These three crucial advances – the adoption of a scientific methodology toward surgical operations, the use of anaesthetic and the introduction of sterilised equipment – laid the groundwork for the modern invasive surgical techniques of today.

The use of X-rays as an important medical diagnostic tool began with their discovery in 1895 by German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen. He noticed that these rays could penetrate the skin, allowing the skeletal structure to be captured on a specially treated photographic plate.

<text>In information theory and coding theory, Reed–Solomon codes are a group of error-correcting codes that were introduced by Irving S. Reed and Gustave Solomon in 1960.
They have many applications, including consumer technologies such as MiniDiscs, CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray discs, QR codes, Data Matrix, data transmission technologies such as DSL and WiMAX, broadcast systems such as satellite communications, DVB and ATSC, and storage systems such as RAID 6.

Reed–Solomon codes operate on a block of data treated as a set of finite-field elements called symbols. Reed–Solomon codes are able to detect and correct multiple symbol errors. By adding =  −  check symbols to the data, a Reed–Solomon code can detect (but not correct) any combination of up to erroneous symbols, &quot;or&quot; locate and correct up to erroneous symbols at unknown locations. As an erasure code, it can correct up to erasures at locations that are known and provided to the algorithm, or it can detect and correct combinations of errors and erasures. Reed–Solomon codes are also suitable as multiple-burst bit-error correcting codes, since a sequence of consecutive bit errors can affect at most two symbols of size . The choice of is up to the designer of the code and may be selected within wide limits.

There are two basic types of Reed–Solomon codes original view and BCH view with BCH view being the most common, as BCH view decoders are faster and require less working storage than original view decoders.

==History==
Reed–Solomon codes were developed in 1960 by Irving S. Reed and Gustave Solomon, who were then staff members of MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Their seminal article was titled &quot;Polynomial Codes over Certain Finite Fields&quot; . The original encoding scheme described in the Reed and Solomon article used a variable polynomial based on the message to be encoded where only a fixed set of values (evaluation points) to be encoded are known to encoder and decoder. The original theoretical decoder generated potential polynomials based on subsets of &quot;k&quot; (unencoded message length) out of &quot;n&quot; (encoded message length) values of a received message, choosing the most popular polynomial as the correct one, which was impractical for all but the simplest of cases. This was initially resolved by changing the original scheme to a BCH-code-like scheme based on a fixed polynomial known to both encoder and decoder, but later, practical decoders based on the original scheme were developed, although slower than the BCH schemes. The result of this is that there are two main types of Reed–Solomon codes: ones that use the original encoding scheme and ones that use the BCH encoding scheme.

Also in 1960, a practical fixed polynomial decoder for BCH codes developed by Daniel Gorenstein and Neal Zierler was described in an MIT Lincoln Laboratory report by Zierler in January 1960 and later in an article in June 1961. The Gorenstein–Zierler decoder and the related work on BCH codes are described in a book &quot;Error-Correcting Codes&quot; by W. Wesley Peterson (1961). By 1963 (or possibly earlier), J. J. Stone (and others) recognized that Reed–Solomon codes could use the BCH scheme of using a fixed generator polynomial, making such codes a special class of BCH codes, but Reed–Solomon codes based on the original encoding scheme are not a class of BCH codes, and depending on the set of evaluation points, they are not even cyclic codes.

In 1969, an improved BCH scheme decoder was developed by Elwyn Berlekamp and James Massey and has since been known as the Berlekamp–Massey decoding algorithm.

In 1975, another improved BCH scheme decoder was developed by Yasuo Sugiyama, based on the extended Euclidean algorithm.

In 1977, Reed–Solomon codes were implemented in the Voyager program in the form of concatenated error correction codes. The first commercial application in mass-produced consumer products appeared in 1982 with the compact disc, where two interleaved Reed–Solomon codes are used. Today, Reed–Solomon codes are widely implemented in digital storage devices and digital communication standards, though they are being slowly replaced by Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem (BCH) codes. For example, Reed–Solomon codes are used in the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) standard DVB-S, in conjunction with a convolutional inner code, but BCH codes are used with LDPC in its successor, DVB-S2.

In 1986, an original scheme decoder known as the Berlekamp–Welch algorithm was developed.

In 1996, variations of original scheme decoders called list decoders or soft decoders were developed by Madhu Sudan and others, and work continues on these types of decoders (see Guruswami–Sudan list decoding algorithm).

In 2002, another original scheme decoder was developed by Shuhong Gao, based on the extended Euclidean algorithm.

== Applications ==

===Data storage===
Reed–Solomon coding is very widely used in mass storage systems to correct
the burst errors associated with media defects.

Reed–Solomon coding is a key component of the compact disc. It was the first use of strong error correction coding in a mass-produced consumer product, and DAT and DVD use similar schemes. In the CD, two layers of Reed–Solomon coding separated by a 28-way convolutional interleaver yields a scheme called Cross-Interleaved Reed–Solomon Coding (CIRC). The first element of a CIRC decoder is a relatively weak inner (32,28) Reed–Solomon code, shortened from a (255,251) code with 8-bit symbols. This code can correct up to 2 byte errors per 32-byte block. More importantly, it flags as erasures any uncorrectable blocks, i.e., blocks with more than 2 byte errors. The decoded 28-byte blocks, with erasure indications, are then spread by the deinterleaver to different blocks of the (28,24) outer code. Thanks to the deinterleaving, an erased 28-byte block from the inner code becomes a single erased byte in each of 28 outer code blocks. The outer code easily corrects this, since it can handle up to 4 such erasures per block.

The result is a CIRC that can completely correct error bursts up to 4000 bits, or about 2.5 mm on the disc surface. This code is so strong that most CD playback errors are almost certainly caused by tracking errors that cause the laser to jump track, not by uncorrectable error bursts.

DVDs use a similar scheme, but with much larger blocks, a (208,192) inner code, and a (182,172) outer code.

Reed–Solomon error correction is also used in parchive files which are commonly posted accompanying multimedia files on USENET. The distributed online storage service Wuala (discontinued in 2015) also used Reed–Solomon when breaking up files.

===Bar code===
Almost all two-dimensional bar codes such as PDF-417, MaxiCode, Datamatrix, QR Code, Aztec Code and Han Xin code use Reed–Solomon error correction to allow correct reading even if a portion of the bar code is damaged. When the bar code scanner cannot recognize a bar code symbol, it will treat it as an erasure.

Reed–Solomon coding is less common in one-dimensional bar codes, but is used by the PostBar symbology.

===Data transmission===
Specialized forms of Reed–Solomon codes, specifically Cauchy-RS and Vandermonde-RS, can be used to overcome the unreliable nature of data transmission over erasure channels. The encoding process assumes a code of RS(&quot;N&quot;, &quot;K&quot;) which results in &quot;N&quot; codewords of length &quot;N&quot; symbols each storing &quot;K&quot; symbols of data, being generated, that are then sent over an erasure channel.

Any combination of &quot;K&quot; codewords received at the other end is enough to reconstruct all of the &quot;N&quot; codewords. The code rate is generally set to 1/2 unless the channel&#x27;s erasure likelihood can be adequately modelled and is seen to be less. In conclusion, &quot;N&quot; is usually 2&quot;K&quot;, meaning that at least half of all the codewords sent must be received in order to reconstruct all of the codewords sent.

Reed–Solomon codes are also used in xDSL systems and CCSDS&#x27;s Space Communications Protocol Specifications as a form of forward error correction.

===Space transmission===

One significant application of Reed–Solomon coding was to encode the digital pictures sent back by the Voyager program.

Voyager introduced Reed–Solomon coding concatenated with convolutional codes, a practice that has since become very widespread in deep space and satellite (e.g., direct digital broadcasting) communications.
Viterbi decoders tend to produce errors in short bursts. Correcting these burst errors is a job best done by short or simplified Reed–Solomon codes.

Modern versions of concatenated Reed–Solomon/Viterbi-decoded convolutional coding were and are used on the Mars Pathfinder, Galileo, Mars Exploration Rover and Cassini missions, where they perform within about 1–1.5 dB of the ultimate limit, the Shannon capacity.

These concatenated codes are now being replaced by more powerful turbo codes:

The Reed–Solomon code is actually a family of codes, where every code is characterised by three parameters: an alphabet size formula_1, a block length formula_2, and a message length formula_3&quot;,&quot; with formula_4. The set of alphabet symbols is interpreted as the finite field formula_5 of order formula_1, and thus, formula_1 must be a prime power. In the most useful parameterizations of the Reed–Solomon code, the block length is usually some constant multiple of the message length, that is, the rate formula_8 is some constant, and furthermore, the block length is either equal to the alphabet size or one less than it, i.e., formula_9 or formula_10.

=== Reed &amp; Solomon&#x27;s original view: The codeword as a sequence of values ===

There are different encoding procedures for the Reed–Solomon code, and thus, there are different ways to describe the set of all codewords.
In the original view of , every codeword of the Reed–Solomon code is a sequence of function values of a polynomial of degree less than formula_3. In order to obtain a codeword of the Reed–Solomon code, the message symbols (each within the q-sized alphabet) are treated as the coefficients of a polynomial formula_12 of degree less than formula_3, over the finite field formula_5 with formula_1 elements.
In turn, the polynomial formula_12 is evaluated at formula_17 distinct points formula_18 of the field formula_5, and the sequence of values is the corresponding codeword. Common choices for a set of evaluation points include formula_20, formula_21, or for formula_22, formula_23, ... , where formula_24 is a primitive element of formula_5.

Formally, the set formula_26 of codewords of the Reed–Solomon code is defined as follows:
formula_27
Since any two &quot;distinct&quot; polynomials of degree less than formula_3 agree in at most formula_29 points, this means that any two codewords of the Reed–Solomon code disagree in at least formula_30 positions. Furthermore, there are two polynomials that do agree in formula_29 points but are not equal, and thus, the distance of the Reed–Solomon code is exactly formula_32. Then the relative distance is formula_33, where formula_34 is the rate. This trade-off between the relative distance and the rate is asymptotically optimal since, by the Singleton bound, &quot;every&quot; code satisfies formula_35.
Being a code that achieves this optimal trade-off, the Reed–Solomon code belongs to the class of maximum distance separable codes.

While the number of different polynomials of degree less than &quot;k&quot; and the number of different messages are both equal to formula_36, and thus every message can be uniquely mapped to such a polynomial, there are different ways of doing this encoding. The original construction of interprets the message &quot;x&quot; as the &quot;coefficients&quot; of the polynomial &quot;p&quot;, whereas subsequent constructions interpret the message as the &quot;values&quot; of the polynomial at the first &quot;k&quot; points formula_37 and obtain the polynomial &quot;p&quot; by interpolating these values with a polynomial of degree less than &quot;k&quot;. The latter encoding procedure, while being slightly less efficient, has the advantage that it gives rise to a systematic code, that is, the original message is always contained as a subsequence of the codeword.

==== Simple encoding procedure: The message as a sequence of coefficients ====
In the original construction of , the message formula_38 is mapped to the polynomial formula_39 with
formula_40
The codeword of formula_41 is obtained by evaluating formula_39 at formula_2 different points formula_44 of the field formula_5. Thus the classical encoding function formula_46 for the Reed–Solomon code is defined as follows:
formula_47
This function formula_48 is a linear mapping, that is, it satisfies formula_49 for the following formula_50-matrix formula_51 with elements from formula_5:
formula_53

This matrix is a Vandermonde matrix over formula_5. In other words, the Reed–Solomon code is a linear code, and in the classical encoding procedure, its generator matrix is formula_51.

==== Systematic encoding procedure: The message as an initial sequence of values ====

There are alternative encoding procedures that produce a systematic Reed–Solomon code. One method uses Lagrange interpolation to compute polynomial formula_39 such that formula_57 Then formula_39 is evaluated at the other points formula_59.

formula_47

This function formula_48 is a linear mapping. To generate the corresponding systematic encoding matrix G, multiply the Vandermonde matrix A by the inverse of A&#x27;s left square submatrix.

formula_62

formula_63 for the following formula_50-matrix formula_65 with elements from formula_5:
formula_67

==== Discrete Fourier transform and its inverse ====

A discrete Fourier transform is essentially the same as the encoding procedure; it uses the generator polynomial formula_39 to map a set of evaluation points into the message values as shown above:
formula_47

The inverse Fourier transform could be used to convert an error free set of &quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;q&quot; message values back into the encoding polynomial of &quot;k&quot; coefficients, with the constraint that in order for this to work, the set of evaluation points used to encode the message must be a set of increasing powers of &quot;α&quot;:
formula_70
formula_71

However, Lagrange interpolation performs the same conversion without the constraint on the set of evaluation points or the requirement of an error free set of message values and is used for systematic encoding, and in one of the steps of the Gao decoder.

=== The BCH view: The codeword as a sequence of coefficients ===
In this view, the message is interpreted as the coefficients of a polynomial formula_72. The sender computes a related polynomial formula_73 of degree formula_74 where formula_75 and sends the polynomial formula_73. The polynomial formula_73 is constructed by multiplying the message polynomial formula_72, which has degree formula_29, with a generator polynomial formula_80 of degree formula_81 that is known to both the sender and the receiver. The generator polynomial formula_80 is defined as the polynomial whose roots are sequential powers of the Galois field primitive formula_24
formula_84

For a &quot;narrow sense code&quot;, formula_85.

formula_86

==== Systematic encoding procedure ====
The encoding procedure for the BCH view of Reed–Solomon codes can be modified to yield a systematic encoding procedure, in which each codeword contains the message as a prefix, and simply appends error correcting symbols as a suffix. Here, instead of sending formula_87, the encoder constructs the transmitted polynomial formula_73 such that the coefficients of the formula_3 largest monomials are equal to the corresponding coefficients of formula_72, and the lower-order coefficients of formula_73 are chosen exactly in such a way that formula_73 becomes divisible by formula_80. Then the coefficients of formula_72 are a subsequence of the coefficients of formula_73. To get a code that is overall systematic, we construct the message polynomial formula_72 by interpreting the message as the sequence of its coefficients.

Formally, the construction is done by multiplying formula_72 by formula_98 to make room for the formula_99 check symbols, dividing that product by formula_80 to find the remainder, and then compensating for that remainder by subtracting it. The formula_101 check symbols are created by computing the remainder formula_102:
formula_103

The remainder has degree at most formula_104, whereas the coefficients of formula_105 in the polynomial formula_106 are zero. Therefore, the following definition of the codeword formula_73 has the property that the first formula_3 coefficients are identical to the coefficients of formula_72:
formula_110

As a result, the codewords formula_73 are indeed elements of formula_26, that is, they are divisible by the generator polynomial formula_80:
formula_114

This function formula_115 is a linear mapping. To generate the corresponding systematic encoding matrix G, set G&#x27;s left square submatrix to the identity matrix and then encode each row:

formula_116
Ignoring leading zeroes, the last row = formula_80.

formula_63 for the following formula_50-matrix formula_65 with elements from formula_5:
formula_67

==Properties==

The Reed–Solomon code is a [&quot;n&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;n&quot; − &quot;k&quot; + 1] code; in other words, it is a linear block code of length &quot;n&quot; (over &quot;F&quot;) with dimension &quot;k&quot; and minimum Hamming distance formula_123 The Reed–Solomon code is optimal in the sense that the minimum distance has the maximum value possible for a linear code of size (&quot;n&quot;, &quot;k&quot;); this is known as the Singleton bound. Such a code is also called a maximum distance separable (MDS) code.

The error-correcting ability of a Reed–Solomon code is determined by its minimum distance, or equivalently, by formula_124, the measure of redundancy in the block. If the locations of the error symbols are not known in advance, then a Reed–Solomon code can correct up to formula_125 erroneous symbols, i.e., it can correct half as many errors as there are redundant symbols added to the block. Sometimes error locations are known in advance (e.g., &quot;side information&quot; in demodulator signal-to-noise ratios)—these are called erasures. A Reed–Solomon code (like any MDS code) is able to correct twice as many erasures as errors, and any combination of errors and erasures can be corrected as long as the relation is satisfied, where formula_126 is the number of errors and formula_127 is the number of erasures in the block.

The theoretical error bound can be described via the following formula for the AWGN channel for FSK:
formula_128
and for other modulation schemes:
formula_129
where formula_130, formula_131, formula_132, formula_115 is the symbol error rate in uncoded AWGN case and formula_134 is the modulation order.

For practical uses of Reed–Solomon codes, it is common to use a finite field formula_5 with formula_136 elements. In this case, each symbol can be represented as an formula_41-bit value.
The sender sends the data points as encoded blocks, and the number of symbols in the encoded block is formula_138. Thus a Reed–Solomon code operating on 8-bit symbols has formula_139 symbols per block. (This is a very popular value because of the prevalence of byte-oriented computer systems.) The number formula_3, with formula_141, of &quot;data&quot; symbols in the block is a design parameter. A commonly used code encodes formula_142 eight-bit data symbols plus 32 eight-bit parity symbols in an formula_143-symbol block; this is denoted as a formula_144 code, and is capable of correcting up to 16 symbol errors per block.

The Reed–Solomon code properties discussed above make them especially well-suited to applications where errors occur in bursts. This is because it does not matter to the code how many bits in a symbol are in error — if multiple bits in a symbol are corrupted it only counts as a single error. Conversely, if a data stream is not characterized by error bursts or drop-outs but by random single bit errors, a Reed–Solomon code is usually a poor choice compared to a binary code.

The Reed–Solomon code, like the convolutional code, is a transparent code. This means that if the channel symbols have been inverted somewhere along the line, the decoders will still operate. The result will be the inversion of the original data. However, the Reed–Solomon code loses its transparency when the code is shortened (&quot;see &#x27;Remarks&#x27; at the end of this section&quot;). The &quot;missing&quot; bits in a shortened code need to be filled by either zeros or ones, depending on whether the data is complemented or not. (To put it another way, if the symbols are inverted, then the zero-fill needs to be inverted to a one-fill.) For this reason it is mandatory that the sense of the data (i.e., true or complemented) be resolved before Reed–Solomon decoding.

Whether the Reed–Solomon code is cyclic or not depends on subtle details of the construction. In the original view of Reed and Solomon, where the codewords are the values of a polynomial, one can choose the sequence of evaluation points in such a way as to make the code cyclic. In particular, if formula_24 is a primitive root of the field formula_5, then by definition all non-zero elements of formula_5 take the form formula_148 for formula_149, where formula_150. Each polynomial formula_12 over formula_5 gives rise to a codeword formula_153. Since the function formula_154 is also a polynomial of the same degree, this function gives rise to a codeword formula_155; since formula_156 holds, this codeword is the cyclic left-shift of the original codeword derived from formula_12. So choosing a sequence of primitive root powers as the evaluation points makes the original view Reed–Solomon code cyclic. Reed–Solomon codes in the BCH view are always cyclic because BCH codes are cyclic.

===Remarks===

Designers are not required to use the &quot;natural&quot; sizes of Reed–Solomon code blocks. A technique known as &quot;shortening&quot; can produce a smaller code of any desired size from a larger code. For example, the widely used (255,223) code can be converted to a (160,128) code by padding the unused portion of the source block with 95 binary zeroes and not transmitting them. At the decoder, the same portion of the block is loaded locally with binary zeroes.

The QR code, Ver 3 (29×29) uses interleaved blocks. The message has 26 data bytes and is encoded using two Reed-Solomon code blocks. Each block is a (255,233) Reed Solomon code shortened to a (35,13) code.

The Delsarte–Goethals–Seidel theorem illustrates an example of an application of shortened Reed–Solomon codes. In parallel to shortening, a technique known as puncturing allows omitting some of the encoded parity symbols.

== BCH view decoders ==

The decoders described in this section use the BCH view of a codeword as a sequence of coefficients. They use a fixed generator polynomial known to both encoder and decoder.

=== Peterson–Gorenstein–Zierler decoder ===

Daniel Gorenstein and Neal Zierler developed a decoder that was described in a MIT Lincoln Laboratory report by Zierler in January 1960 and later in a paper in June 1961. The Gorenstein–Zierler decoder and the related work on BCH codes are described in a book &quot;Error Correcting Codes&quot; by W. Wesley Peterson (1961).

====Formulation====

The transmitted message, formula_158, is viewed as the coefficients of a polynomial
formula_159

As a result of the Reed–Solomon encoding procedure, &quot;s&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is divisible by the generator polynomial
formula_160
where &quot;α&quot; is a primitive element.

Since &quot;s&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a multiple of the generator &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), it follows that it &quot;inherits&quot; all its roots:
formula_161
Therefore,
formula_162

The transmitted polynomial is corrupted in transit by an error polynomial
formula_163
to produce the received polynomial
formula_164

Coefficient &quot;ei&quot; will be zero if there is no error at that power of &quot;x&quot;, and nonzero if there is an error. If there are &quot;ν&quot; errors at distinct powers &quot;ik&quot; of &quot;x&quot;, then
formula_165

The goal of the decoder is to find the number of errors (&quot;ν&quot;), the positions of the errors (&quot;ik&quot;), and the error values at those positions (&quot;eik&quot;). From those, &quot;e&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) can be calculated and subtracted from &quot;r&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) to get the originally sent message &quot;s&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).

====Syndrome decoding====

The decoder starts by evaluating the polynomial as received at points formula_166. We call the results of that evaluation the &quot;syndromes&quot; &quot;S&quot;&quot;j&quot;. They are defined as
formula_167
Note that formula_168 because formula_73 has roots at formula_170, as shown in the previous section.

The advantage of looking at the syndromes is that the message polynomial drops out. In other words, the syndromes only relate to the error and are unaffected by the actual contents of the message being transmitted. If the syndromes are all zero, the algorithm stops here and reports that the message was not corrupted in transit.

====Error locators and error values====
For convenience, define the error locators &quot;Xk&quot; and error values &quot;Yk&quot; as
formula_171

Then the syndromes can be written in terms of these error locators and error values as
formula_172

This definition of the syndrome values is equivalent to the previous since formula_173.

The syndromes give a system of equations in 2&quot;ν&quot; unknowns, but that system of equations is nonlinear in the &quot;Xk&quot; and does not have an obvious solution. However, if the &quot;Xk&quot; were known (see below), then the syndrome equations provide a linear system of equations

formula_174
which can easily be solved for the &quot;Yk&quot; error values.

Consequently, the problem is finding the &quot;Xk&quot;, because then the leftmost matrix would be known, and both sides of the equation could be multiplied by its inverse, yielding Y&quot;k&quot;

In the variant of this algorithm where the locations of the errors are already known (when it is being used as an erasure code), this is the end. The error locations (&quot;Xk&quot;) are already known by some other method (for example, in an FM transmission, the sections where the bitstream was unclear or overcome with interference are probabilistically determinable from frequency analysis). In this scenario, up to formula_124 errors can be corrected.

The rest of the algorithm serves to locate the errors and will require syndrome values up to formula_176, instead of just the formula_177 used thus far. This is why twice as many error-correcting symbols need to be added as can be corrected without knowing their locations.

====Error locator polynomial====

There is a linear recurrence relation that gives rise to a system of linear equations. Solving those equations identifies those error locations &quot;Xk&quot;.

Define the error locator polynomial as
formula_178

The zeros of are the reciprocals formula_179. This follows from the above product notation construction, since if formula_180, then one of the multiplied terms will be zero, formula_181, making the whole polynomial evaluate to zero:
formula_182

Let formula_183 be any integer such that formula_184. Multiply both sides by formula_185, and it will still be zero:
formula_186

Sum for &quot;k&quot; = 1 to &quot;ν&quot;, and it will still be zero:
formula_187

Collect each term into its own sum:
formula_188

Extract the constant values of formula_189 that are unaffected by the summation:
formula_190

These summations are now equivalent to the syndrome values, which we know and can substitute in. This therefore reduces to
formula_191

Subtracting formula_192 from both sides yields
formula_193

Recall that &quot;j&quot; was chosen to be any integer between 1 and &quot;v&quot; inclusive, and this equivalence is true for all such values. Therefore, we have &quot;v&quot; linear equations, not just one. This system of linear equations can therefore be solved for the coefficients Λ&quot;i&quot; of the error-location polynomial:
formula_194
The above assumes that the decoder knows the number of errors &quot;ν&quot;, but that number has not been determined yet. The PGZ decoder does not determine &quot;ν&quot; directly but rather searches for it by trying successive values. The decoder first assumes the largest value for a trial &quot;ν&quot; and sets up the linear system for that value. If the equations can be solved (i.e., the matrix determinant is nonzero), then that trial value is the number of errors. If the linear system cannot be solved, then the trial &quot;ν&quot; is reduced by one and the next smaller system is examined .

====Find the roots of the error locator polynomial====

Use the coefficients Λ&quot;i&quot; found in the last step to build the error location polynomial. The roots of the error location polynomial can be found by exhaustive search. The error locators &quot;Xk&quot; are the reciprocals of those roots. The order of coefficients of the error location polynomial can be reversed, in which case the roots of that reversed polynomial are the error locators formula_195 (not their reciprocals formula_179). Chien search is an efficient implementation of this step.

====Calculate the error values====

Once the error locators &quot;Xk&quot; are known, the error values can be determined. This can be done by direct solution for &quot;Yk&quot; in the error equations matrix given above, or using the Forney algorithm.

====Calculate the error locations====

Calculate &quot;ik&quot; by taking the log base formula_24 of &quot;Xk&quot;. This is generally done using a precomputed lookup table.

====Fix the errors====

Finally, &quot;e&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is generated from &quot;ik&quot; and &quot;eik&quot; and then is subtracted from &quot;r&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) to get the originally sent message &quot;s&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), with errors corrected.

==== Example ====

Consider the Reed–Solomon code defined in with and (this is used in PDF417 barcodes) for a RS(7,3) code. The generator polynomial is
formula_198
If the message polynomial is , then a systematic codeword is encoded as follows:
formula_199
formula_200
Errors in transmission might cause this to be received instead:
formula_201
The syndromes are calculated by evaluating &quot;r&quot; at powers of &quot;α&quot;:
formula_202
formula_203
yielding the system
formula_204

Using Gaussian elimination,
formula_205
so
formula_206
with roots &quot;x&quot;1 = 757 = 3−3 and &quot;x&quot;2 = 562 = 3−4.
The coefficients can be reversed:
formula_207
to produce roots 27 = 33 and 81 = 34 with positive exponents, but typically this isn&#x27;t used. The logarithm of the inverted roots corresponds to the error locations (right to left, location 0 is the last term in the codeword).

To calculate the error values, apply the Forney algorithm:
formula_208
formula_209
formula_210
formula_211

Subtracting formula_212 from the received polynomial &quot;r&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) reproduces the original codeword &quot;s&quot;.

=== Berlekamp–Massey decoder ===
The Berlekamp–Massey algorithm is an alternate iterative procedure for finding the error locator polynomial. During each iteration, it calculates a discrepancy based on a current instance of Λ(&quot;x&quot;) with an assumed number of errors &quot;e&quot;:
formula_213
and then adjusts Λ(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;e&quot; so that a recalculated Δ would be zero. The article Berlekamp–Massey algorithm has a detailed description of the procedure. In the following example, &quot;C&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is used to represent Λ(&quot;x&quot;).

==== Example ====

Using the same data as the Peterson Gorenstein Zierler example above:

The final value of &quot;C&quot; is the error locator polynomial, Λ(&quot;x&quot;).

=== Euclidean decoder ===

Another iterative method for calculating both the error locator polynomial and the error value polynomial is based on Sugiyama&#x27;s adaptation of the extended Euclidean algorithm .

Define &quot;S&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), Λ(&quot;x&quot;), and Ω(&quot;x&quot;) for &quot;t&quot; syndromes and &quot;e&quot; errors:
formula_214

The key equation is:
formula_215

For &quot;t&quot; = 6 and &quot;e&quot; = 3:
formula_216

The middle terms are zero due to the relationship between Λ and syndromes.

The extended Euclidean algorithm can find a series of polynomials of the form

where the degree of &quot;R&quot; decreases as &quot;i&quot; increases. Once the degree of &quot;R&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) &lt; &quot;t&quot;/2, then


&quot;B&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) don&#x27;t need to be saved, so the algorithm becomes:

 &quot;R&quot;−1 := &quot;x&quot;&quot;t&quot;
 &quot;R&quot;0 := &quot;S&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)
 &quot;A&quot;−1 := 0
 &quot;A&quot;0 := 1
 &quot;i&quot; := 0
 while degree of &quot;R&quot;&quot;i&quot; ≥ &quot;t&quot;/2
 &quot;i&quot; := &quot;i&quot; + 1
 &quot;Q&quot; := &quot;R&quot;&quot;i&quot;-2 / &quot;R&quot;&quot;i&quot;-1
 &quot;R&quot;&quot;i&quot; := &quot;R&quot;&quot;i&quot;-2 - &quot;Q&quot; &quot;R&quot;&quot;i&quot;-1
 &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; := &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;-2 - &quot;Q&quot; &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;-1
to set low order term of Λ(&quot;x&quot;) to 1, divide Λ(&quot;x&quot;) and Ω(&quot;x&quot;) by &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;(0):
&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;(0) is the constant (low order) term of Ai.

==== Example ====

Using the same data as the Peterson–Gorenstein–Zierler example above:


=== Decoder using discrete Fourier transform ===

A discrete Fourier transform can be used for decoding. To avoid conflict with syndrome names, let &quot;c&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;s&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) the encoded codeword. &quot;r&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;e&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) are the same as above. Define &quot;C&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), &quot;E&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), and &quot;R&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) as the discrete Fourier transforms of &quot;c&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), &quot;e&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), and &quot;r&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). Since &quot;r&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;c&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) + &quot;e&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), and since a discrete Fourier transform is a linear operator, &quot;R&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;C&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) + &quot;E&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).

Transform &quot;r&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) to &quot;R&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) using discrete Fourier transform. Since the calculation for a discrete Fourier transform is the same as the calculation for syndromes, &quot;t&quot; coefficients of &quot;R&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;E&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) are the same as the syndromes:
formula_217

Use formula_218 through formula_219 as syndromes (they&#x27;re the same) and generate the error locator polynomial using the methods from any of the above decoders.

Let &quot;v&quot; = number of errors. Generate &quot;E&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) using the known coefficients formula_220 to formula_221, the error locator polynomial, and these formulas
formula_222

Then calculate &quot;C&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;R&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) − &quot;E&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and take the inverse transform (polynomial interpolation) of &quot;C&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) to produce &quot;c&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).

===Decoding beyond the error-correction bound===

The Singleton bound states that the minimum distance &quot;d&quot; of a linear block code of size (&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) is upper-bounded by . The distance &quot;d&quot; was usually understood to limit the error-correction capability to . The Reed–Solomon code achieves this bound with equality, and can thus correct up to errors. However, this error-correction bound is not exact.

In 1999, Madhu Sudan and Venkatesan Guruswami at MIT published &quot;Improved Decoding of Reed–Solomon and Algebraic-Geometry Codes&quot; introducing an algorithm that allowed for the correction of errors beyond half the minimum distance of the code. It applies to Reed–Solomon codes and more generally to algebraic geometric codes. This algorithm produces a list of codewords (it is a list-decoding algorithm) and is based on interpolation and factorization of polynomials over formula_223 and its extensions.

In 2023, building on three exciting works, coding theorists showed that Reed-Solomon codes defined over random evaluation points can actually achieve list decoding capacity (up to errors) over linear size alphabets with high probability. However, this result is combinatorial rather than algorithmic.

===Soft-decoding===

The algebraic decoding methods described above are hard-decision methods, which means that for every symbol a hard decision is made about its value. For example, a decoder could associate with each symbol an additional value corresponding to the channel demodulator&#x27;s confidence in the correctness of the symbol. The advent of LDPC and turbo codes, which employ iterated soft-decision belief propagation decoding methods to achieve error-correction performance close to the theoretical limit, has spurred interest in applying soft-decision decoding to conventional algebraic codes. In 2003, Ralf Koetter and Alexander Vardy presented a polynomial-time soft-decision algebraic list-decoding algorithm for Reed–Solomon codes, which was based upon the work by Sudan and Guruswami.
In 2016, Steven J. Franke and Joseph H. Taylor published a novel soft-decision decoder.

=== MATLAB example ===

==== Encoder ====
Here we present a simple MATLAB implementation for an encoder.

function encoded = rsEncoder(msg, m, prim_poly, n, k)
 % RSENCODER Encode message with the Reed-Solomon algorithm
 % m is the number of bits per symbol
 % prim_poly: Primitive polynomial p(x). Ie for DM is 301
 % k is the size of the message
 % n is the total size (k+redundant)
 % Example: msg = uint8(&#x27;Test&#x27;)
 % enc_msg = rsEncoder(msg, 8, 301, 12, numel(msg));

 % Get the alpha
 alpha = gf(2, m, prim_poly);

 % Get the Reed-Solomon generating polynomial g(x)
 g_x = genpoly(k, n, alpha);

 % Multiply the information by X^(n-k), or just pad with zeros at the end to
 % get space to add the redundant information
 msg_padded = gf([msg zeros(1, n - k)], m, prim_poly);

 % Get the remainder of the division of the extended message by the
 % Reed-Solomon generating polynomial g(x)
 [~, remainder] = deconv(msg_padded, g_x);

 % Now return the message with the redundant information
 encoded = msg_padded - remainder;

end

% Find the Reed-Solomon generating polynomial g(x), by the way this is the

==== Decoder ====
Now the decoding part:

function [decoded, error_pos, error_mag, g, S] = rsDecoder(encoded, m, prim_poly, n, k)
 % RSDECODER Decode a Reed-Solomon encoded message
 % Example:
 % [dec, ~, ~, ~, ~] = rsDecoder(enc_msg, 8, 301, 12, numel(msg))
 max_errors = floor((n - k) / 2);
 orig_vals = encoded.x;
 % Initialize the error vector
 errors = zeros(1, n);

 % Get the alpha

 % Find the syndromes (Check if dividing the message by the generator
 % polynomial the result is zero)

 % If all syndromes are zeros (perfectly divisible) there are no errors
 if isempty(Syndromes.x)

 % Update r0, r1, g0, g1 and remove leading zeros

 % Find the zeros of the error polynomial on this galois field

 % Prepare a linear system to solve the error polynomial and find the error
 % magnitudes

 end

 % Solve the linear system
 error_mag = (gf(er, m, prim_poly) \ gf(b, m, prim_poly))&#x27;;
 % Put the error magnitude on the error vector

 % Now to fix the errors just add with the encoded code

== Reed Solomon original view decoders ==

The decoders described in this section use the Reed Solomon original view of a codeword as a sequence of polynomial values where the polynomial is based on the message to be encoded. The same set of fixed values are used by the encoder and decoder, and the decoder recovers the encoding polynomial (and optionally an error locating polynomial) from the received message.

=== Theoretical decoder ===

 described a theoretical decoder that corrected errors by finding the most popular message polynomial. The decoder only knows the set of values formula_224 to formula_225 and which encoding method was used to generate the codeword&#x27;s sequence of values. The original message, the polynomial, and any errors are unknown. A decoding procedure could use a method like Lagrange interpolation on various subsets of n codeword values taken k at a time to repeatedly produce potential polynomials, until a sufficient number of matching polynomials are produced to reasonably eliminate any errors in the received codeword. Once a polynomial is determined, then any errors in the codeword can be corrected, by recalculating the corresponding codeword values. Unfortunately, in all but the simplest of cases, there are too many subsets, so the algorithm is impractical. The number of subsets is the binomial coefficient, formula_226, and the number of subsets is infeasible for even modest codes. For a formula_227 code that can correct 3 errors, the naïve theoretical decoder would examine 359 billion subsets. 

=== Berlekamp Welch decoder ===

In 1986, a decoder known as the Berlekamp–Welch algorithm was developed as a decoder that is able to recover the original message polynomial as well as an error &quot;locator&quot; polynomial that produces zeroes for the input values that correspond to errors, with time complexity formula_228, where formula_2 is the number of values in a message. The recovered polynomial is then used to recover (recalculate as needed) the original message.

==== Example ====

Using RS(7,3), GF(929), and the set of evaluation points &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;i&quot; − 1

If the message polynomial is
The codeword is
Errors in transmission might cause this to be received instead.
The key equations are:

formula_230

Assume maximum number of errors: &quot;e&quot; = 2. The key equations become:

formula_231

formula_232

Using Gaussian elimination:

formula_233



Recalculate where to correct resulting in the corrected codeword:

=== Gao decoder ===

In 2002, an improved decoder was developed by Shuhong Gao, based on the extended Euclid algorithm.

==== Example ====

Using the same data as the Berlekamp Welch example above:

*formula_234
*formula_235 Lagrange interpolation of formula_236 for &quot;i&quot; = 1 to &quot;n&quot;
*formula_237
*formula_238



divide &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;E&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) by most significant coefficient of &quot;E&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 708. (Optional)

<text>Zorba the Greek (, &quot;Alexis Zorbas&quot;) is a 1964 drama film written, produced, edited, and directed by Greek Cypriot filmmaker Michael Cacoyannis. It stars Anthony Quinn as Zorba, an earthy and boisterous Cretan peasant, and Alan Bates as Basil, the buttoned-up young intellectual he befriends. The cast also includes Lila Kedrova, Irene Papas, and Sotiris Moustakas. The musical score was composed by Mikis Theodorakis. The film is based on the 1946 novel &quot;The Life and Times of Alexis Zorba&quot; by Nikos Kazantzakis.

The film centers on Zorba and Basil&#x27;s misadventures in trying to build a lignite mine through an impoverished Cretan village, as their polar different personalities lead them into affairs and schemes that have disastrous results, culminating in the village&#x27;s evacuation by its populace. Much of the film&#x27;s interactions focus on the lead characters&#x27; views and attitudes, culminating in the final scene where they dance joyfully before parting ways.

Though the film has elements of comedy, and Kazantzakis&#x27;s anti-hero Zorba has been generally understood as a &#x27;life-affirming&#x27; personality (faithfully reproduced in Cacoyannis&#x27;s screenplay), it features a gruesome femicide, and Zorba&#x27;s cynical, egotistical and manipulative personality combined with his determined optimism is explicitly shown to be a response to, and in defiance of, the cruelties and vicissitudes of life.

Produced in Greece for under $1 million, &quot;Zorba&quot; was a considerable critical and commercial success, grossing over nine times its production budget at the U.S. box office alone. At the 37th Academy Awards, the film won awards for Best Supporting Actress (Kedrova), Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction. Other nominations included Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Anthony Quinn, whose performance has been cited as one of the most iconic in film history, and which spawned the folk dance known as the sirtaki. The film and its source novel were later adapted into a Tony-winning stage musical, in which Cacoyannis, Quinn, and Kedrova all participated.

==Plot==
Basil is a staid, somewhat buttoned-up, middle-class Greek-British writer raised in the United Kingdom. While at the Athens port of Piraeus waiting to catch a ferry to Crete he meets a middle-aged peasant and musician named Zorba who carries only a santouri in a case, in contrast to Basil&#x27;s large quantity of luggage, including cases of books. Basil explains to Zorba that he is travelling to a Cretan village where he owns some land with the intention of re-opening a lignite mine and perhaps curing his writer&#x27;s block. Zorba has already related that he has experience as a miner and inveigles himself a position as Basil&#x27;s foreman and factotum.

When they arrive at the Cretan village they are greeted enthusiastically by the impoverished populace. They lodge initially with an elderly French former cabaret dancer named Madame Hortense in her self-styled &quot;Hotel Ritz&quot;. Hortense relates her glamorous and exotic past as a courtesan among the competing Mediterranean powers, hinting that she was the lover of an Italian Admiral called Cannavaro (after whom she has named her pet parrot). Zorba tries to persuade Basil to enter into a relationship with Madame Hortense, but he is reluctant so Zorba, with an eye on the main chance, seizes the opportunity, somewhat cynically exercising his considerable charm on the lonely woman.

Zorba admits to Basil that he has a chequered past, having been guilty of rape and murder as a soldier, his excuse being that they were &#x27;only&#x27; Bulgarians and Turks. He asserts that now, however, he rejects nationalism and bears no-one any grudges. He also shows Basil his battle wounds, &#x27;all in front&#x27; (an oblique reference to Alexander the Great).

Over the next few days, Basil and Zorba attempt to work the old lignite mine, but it collapses and Zorba narrowly avoids injury. Zorba then has an idea to use the forest in the nearby mountains to source lumber to make new pit-props to replace the rotten timbers of the mine. The land is owned by a monastery. Zorba tricks the monks into believing that a miracle has occurred, as part of a ploy to get them to give up the timber. Exultant, when he gets home he breaks spontaneously into a dance, the so-called &#x27;butcher&#x27;s dance&#x27; or sirtaki in a scene which contrasts his exultant egotism with Basil&#x27;s nervous inhibition.

Zorba designs a system by which tree-trunks can be sent down the mountain suspended from a wire.

Among the other residents is a young and attractive widowed woman who is resented and hated by the villagers for not remarrying. A young local boy, the son of one of the more important peasants, is madly in love with her, but she has spurned him repeatedly. One rainy afternoon, Basil offers her his umbrella, which she reluctantly takes. Zorba, who increasingly treats his &#x27;Boss&#x27; as a pupil or nephew, knowingly suggests that she is attracted to him, but Basil, ever shy, refuses to pursue her.

To get supplies to build the zip-wire to bring the timbers down the mountain, Basil gives Zorba some money and sends him to the large port of Chania to buy cable and other supplies. But in Chania Zorba gets drunk, visits a cabaret, and spends money on presents and on drinking champagne with a cabaret dancer/hospitality girl with whom he spends the night. He also has his hair dyed as a symbol of his rediscovered youth and potency. In a letter to Basil, he details his exploits. Angered by Zorba&#x27;s irresponsibility and the squandering of his money, Basil untruthfully tells Madame Hortense, who is smitten with Zorba but feels abandoned, that Zorba intends to marry her upon his return, upon hearing which she is ecstatic. Meanwhile, the Widow returns Basil&#x27;s umbrella by way of Mimithos, the village idiot.

Basil, after much agonising, and untypically unshaven and perhaps drunk, goes to the Widow&#x27;s house. She lets him in but then she sheds some tears. Embarrassed, he decides to leave but she stops him and they spend the night together. However, their assignation has been observed by the jealous men of the village.

When Zorba eventually returns with the supplies and gifts he is surprised and angered to hear of Basil&#x27;s lie to Madame Hortense. He also asks Basil about his whereabouts the night before. The brief encounter comes at a great cost. Word spreads of Basil&#x27;s visit to the Widow and the men of the village, to make trouble, tell the youth who is in love with her, whereupon he drowns himself. When the widow attempts to attend the funeral, she is blocked from entering the church by the youth&#x27;s father. The villagers blame her for the boy&#x27;s suicide, though the clear implication is that she has been condemned for on the one hand being sexually active after the death of her husband and on the other rejecting the men of the village, personified by the boy. Some of the men of the village corral her outside the church and begin to stone her, watched and encouraged by the villagers. Basil, unable to push through the crowd to intervene, sends Mimithos to fetch Zorba. Zorba arrives just as the villager who had maliciously informed the boy of Basil&#x27;s tryst is about to kill the widow with his knife - with the explicit approval of the boy&#x27;s father who is watching on. Zorba overpowers the younger man and disarms him but, thinking that the situation is under control, when he asks the widow to follow him and turns to go, the dead boy&#x27;s father pulls his knife and cuts the widow&#x27;s throat himself. The villagers close ranks around the father and his accomplices, shielding them as they all disperse, leaving only the outsiders, Basil, Zorba, and the idiot Mimithos, who is distraught. Basil laments his inability to intervene, and Zorba angrily laments the meaninglessness of the widow&#x27;s death and of all deaths. Neither of them blames the villagers explicitly or remark on the barbarity of the widow&#x27;s murder. The film cuts to a scene in which Basil, Zorba and the villagers construct the zip-wire system for the timber, to the accompaniment of light-hearted music on the soundtrack.

On a rainy day, Basil and Zorba come home and find Madame Hortense waiting. She expresses anger at Zorba for making no progress on the wedding. Zorba conjures up a story that he had ordered a white satin wedding dress, lined with pearls and adorned with real gold. Madame Hortense presents two golden rings she had made and proposes their immediate engagement. Zorba tries to stall, but eventually agrees with gusto, to Basil&#x27;s surprise.

Some time later, Madame Hortense contracts pneumonia and is seen on her deathbed. Zorba stays by her side, along with Basil. Meanwhile, word spreads that &quot;the foreigner&quot; is dying, and since she has no heirs, the State will take her possessions and money. The poor villagers crowd around her hotel, impatiently waiting for her demise so they can steal her belongings. As two old ladies enter her room and gaze expectantly at her, other women try to enter, but Zorba manages to fight them off. At the instant of her death, the women re-enter Madame Hortense&#x27;s bedroom &quot;en masse&quot; to steal her valued possessions. Zorba leaves with a sigh, as the hotel is ransacked and stripped bare by the shrieking and excited villagers. When Zorba returns to Madame Hortense&#x27;s bedroom, the room is barren apart from her bed (where she lies) and the parrot in her cage. Zorba takes the birdcage with him.

Finally, Zorba&#x27;s elaborate contraption to transport timber down the hill is complete. A festive ceremony is held, including lamb roasting on a spit and a barrel of wine, and all the villagers attend. After a blessing from the priests, Zorba signals by firing a rifle in the air and log is sent hurtling down the zip line but at excessive speed, destroying the log itself and slightly damaging part of the contraption. Zorba pretends to be unconcerned and gives orders for a second log to be sent down. This one also comes down too quickly and overshoots straight into the sea. By now the villagers and priests have grown fearful and head for cover. Zorba remains unfazed and signals for the third log, which accelerates with such violence that it destroys the entire contraption creating havoc among the crowd. The villagers and monks flee in terror, leaving only Basil and Zorba amidst the wreckage.

They sit by the shore to eat the roasted lamb and drink the wine alone. Zorba pretends to tell the future from a lamb bone, saying that he foresees a great journey to a big city. He asks Basil when he plans to leave, and Basil replies that he will go in a few days. Zorba tells him that the one thing Basil is missing is the element of &#x27;madness&#x27; that enables a man to &#x27;break free&#x27; (the implication being, free from circumstance, responsibility, care). They begin to laugh hysterically at the catastrophic outcome of their scheme and the effect on the villagers. Basil asks Zorba to teach him to dance, and the film ends with both men enthusiastically dancing the sirtaki on the deserted shore.

Specific locations featured include the city of Chania, the village of Kokkino Chorio in the Apokoronas region and Stavros Beach in the Akrotiri peninsula. The scene in which Quinn&#x27;s character dances the Sirtaki was filmed on the beach of the village of Stavros.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was a smash hit. Produced on a budget of only $783,000, it grossed $9 million at the U.S. box office, earning $4.4 million in U.S. theatrical rentals. At the worldwide box office, the film earned $9.4 million in rentals, placing the worldwide gross between $18.8 million and $23.5 million. It was the 17th highest-grossing film of 1964.

According to Fox Records, the film needed to earn $3,000,000 in rentals to break even and made $9,400,000. By September 1970 it earned the studio an estimated profit of $2,565,000.

===Critical response===

Reviews of the film were generally positive, with Anthony Quinn and Lila Kedrova receiving numerous accolades for their performances, although a few critics found fault with the screenplay. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; lauded Quinn for a &quot;brilliant performance&quot; and Kedrova for her &quot;brilliantly realized&quot; character, citing the only real weakness of the film as a lack of &quot;significant conflict to prove its dominant character. Zorba is powerful and provocative, but nobody gets in his way.&quot; Margaret Harford of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; declared that the film would &quot;stand among the year&#x27;s best motion pictures, an unusual, engrossing effort&quot; with spots both &quot;outrageously funny&quot; and &quot;painfully sad and tragic.&quot;

Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; deemed it &quot;a memorable picture&quot; with a &quot;bravura performance&quot; from Quinn, adding that &quot;Lila Kedrova as the dying Mme Hortense is spectacularly touching.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; found the film excessively long (at around two hours and thirty minutes) and overstuffed, writing that Cacoyannis&#x27;s screenplay was &quot;packed with incidents of varying moods, so packed, in fact, that some of the more important ones cannot be developed fully.&quot; Brendan Gill of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that Cacoyannis had directed the film with &quot;enormous verve&quot; but had written a &quot;not very tidy, not very plausible screenplay.&quot; Gill particularly praised Kedrova&#x27;s performance and thought that she &quot;comes within an ace of stealing the picture from Quinn.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that the film began well, but by the time the characters went to Crete &quot;the pace slows to a crawl, and the narrative line becomes blurred in a series of unrelated incidents of doubtful significance.&quot; The review concluded that for all its length, &quot;the film never gets down to a clear statement of its theme, or comes within measuring the distance of its vast pretensions.&quot;

 On both sides of the Atlantic, &quot;Zorba&quot; was applauded and Quinn came in for the best reviews. He was lauded as Zorba, along with the other stars, including Greek-born Papas, who worked with Quinn on &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;.

=== Awards and nominations ===
==Preservation==
The Academy Film Archive preserved &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; in 2004.

==In popular culture==
In a January 15, 1968 &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip, Snoopy is happily dancing atop of his doghouse with Lucy looking on until the final panel where she comments: &quot;Zorba the Greek, you aren&#x27;t!&quot;.

In a July 16, 1991 &quot;Big Nate&quot; comic strip, Nate mistakes the name of the movie as &quot;Zorba the Geek&quot;.

<text>The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat and the fastest land animal. It has a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. The head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between . Adults weigh between . The cheetah is capable of running at ; it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail.

The cheetah was first described in the late 18th century. Four subspecies are recognised today that are native to Africa and central Iran. An African subspecies was introduced to India in 2022. It is now distributed mainly in small, fragmented populations in northwestern, eastern and southern Africa and central Iran. It lives in a variety of habitats such as savannahs in the Serengeti, arid mountain ranges in the Sahara, and hilly desert terrain.

The cheetah lives in three main social groups: females and their cubs, male &quot;coalitions&quot;, and solitary males. While females lead a nomadic life searching for prey in large home ranges, males are more sedentary and instead establish much smaller territories in areas with plentiful prey and access to females. The cheetah is active during the day, with peaks during dawn and dusk. It feeds on small- to medium-sized prey, mostly weighing under , and prefers medium-sized ungulates such as impala, springbok and Thomson&#x27;s gazelles. The cheetah typically stalks its prey within before charging towards it, trips it during the chase and bites its throat to suffocate it to death. It breeds throughout the year. After a gestation of nearly three months, females give birth to a litter of three or four cubs. Cheetah cubs are highly vulnerable to predation by other large carnivores. They are weaned at around four months and are independent by around 20 months of age.

The cheetah is threatened by habitat loss, conflict with humans, poaching and high susceptibility to diseases. The global cheetah population was estimated in 2021 at 6,517; it is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. It has been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation. It was tamed in ancient Egypt and trained for hunting ungulates in the Arabian Peninsula and India. It has been kept in zoos since the early 19th century.

==Etymology==
The vernacular name &quot;cheetah&quot; is derived from Hindustani and (). This in turn comes from () meaning &#x27;variegated&#x27;, &#x27;adorned&#x27; or &#x27;painted&#x27;. In the past, the cheetah was often called &quot;hunting leopard&quot; because they could be tamed and used for coursing. The generic name &quot;Acinonyx&quot; probably derives from the combination of two Greek words: () meaning &#x27;unmoved&#x27; or &#x27;motionless&#x27;, and () meaning &#x27;nail&#x27; or &#x27;hoof&#x27;. A rough translation is &quot;immobile nails&quot;, a reference to the cheetah&#x27;s limited ability to retract its claws. A similar meaning can be obtained by the combination of the Greek prefix &quot;a–&quot; (implying a lack of) and () meaning &#x27;to move&#x27; or &#x27;to set in motion&#x27;. The specific name is Latin for &#x27;crested, having a mane&#x27;.

A few old generic names such as &quot;Cynailurus&quot; and &quot;Cynofelis&quot; allude to the similarities between the cheetah and canids.

==Taxonomy==
In 1777, Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber described the cheetah based on a skin from the Cape of Good Hope and gave it the scientific name &quot;Felis jubatus&quot;. Joshua Brookes proposed the generic name &quot;Acinonyx&quot; in 1828. In 1917, Reginald Innes Pocock placed the cheetah in a subfamily of its own, Acinonychinae, given its striking morphological resemblance to the greyhound and significant deviation from typical felid features; the cheetah was classified in Felinae in later taxonomic revisions.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, several cheetah zoological specimens were described; some were proposed as subspecies.
A South African specimen with notably dense fur was proposed as (&quot;Felis lanea&quot;) by Philip Sclater in 1877 and became known as the &quot;woolly cheetah&quot;. Its classification as a species was mostly disputed. There has been considerable confusion in the nomenclature of the cheetah and leopard (&quot;Panthera pardus&quot;) as authors often confused the two; some considered &quot;hunting leopards&quot; an independent species, or equal to the leopard.

===Subspecies===
In 1975, five cheetah subspecies were considered valid taxa: &quot;A. j. hecki&quot;, &quot;A. j. jubatus&quot;, &quot;A. j. raineyi&quot;, &quot;A. j. soemmeringii&quot; and &quot;A. j. venaticus&quot;. In 2011, a phylogeographic study found minimal genetic variation between &quot;A. j. jubatus&quot; and &quot;A. j. raineyi&quot;; only four subspecies were identified. In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the IUCN Cat Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy and recognised these four subspecies as valid. Their details are tabulated below:

==Phylogeny and evolution==
The cheetah&#x27;s closest relatives are the cougar (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;) and the jaguarundi (&quot;Herpailurus yagouaroundi&quot;). Together, these three species form the &quot;Puma&quot; lineage, one of the eight lineages of the extant felids; the &quot;Puma&quot; lineage genetically diverged from the rest 6.7 mya. The sister group of the &quot;Puma&quot; lineage is a clade of smaller Old World cats that includes the genera &quot;Felis&quot;, &quot;Otocolobus&quot; and &quot;Prionailurus&quot;.

The oldest cheetah fossils, excavated in eastern and southern Africa, date to 3.5–3 mya; the earliest known specimen from South Africa is from the lowermost deposits of the Silberberg Grotto (Sterkfontein). Though incomplete, these fossils indicate forms larger but less cursorial than the modern cheetah. The first occurrence of the modern species &quot;A. jubatus&quot; in Africa may come from Cooper&#x27;s D, a site in South Africa dating back to 1.5 to 1.4 Ma, during the Calabrian stage. Fossil remains from Europe are limited to a few Middle Pleistocene specimens from Hundsheim (Austria) and Mosbach Sands (Germany). Cheetah-like cats are known from as late as 10,000 years ago from the Old World. The giant cheetah (&quot;A. pardinensis&quot;), significantly larger and slower compared to the modern cheetah, occurred in Eurasia and eastern and southern Africa in the Villafranchian period roughly 3.8–1.9 mya. In the Middle Pleistocene a smaller cheetah, &quot;A. intermedius&quot;, ranged from Europe to China. The modern cheetah appeared in Africa around 1.9 mya; its fossil record is restricted to Africa.

Extinct North American cheetah-like cats had historically been classified in &quot;Felis&quot;, &quot;Puma&quot; or &quot;Acinonyx&quot;; two such species, &quot;F. studeri&quot; and &quot;F. trumani&quot;, were considered to be closer to the puma than the cheetah, despite their close similarities to the latter. Noting this, palaeontologist Daniel Adams proposed &quot;Miracinonyx&quot;, a new subgenus under &quot;Acinonyx&quot;, in 1979 for the North American cheetah-like cats; this was later elevated to genus rank. Adams pointed out that North American and Old World cheetah-like cats may have had a common ancestor, and &quot;Acinonyx&quot; might have originated in North America instead of Eurasia. However, subsequent research has shown that &quot;Miracinonyx&quot; is phylogenetically closer to the cougar than the cheetah; the similarities to cheetahs have been attributed to parallel evolution.

The three species of the &quot;Puma&quot; lineage may have had a common ancestor during the Miocene (roughly 8.25 mya). Some suggest that North American cheetahs possibly migrated to Asia via the Bering Strait, then dispersed southward to Africa through Eurasia at least 100,000 years ago; some authors have expressed doubt over the occurrence of cheetah-like cats in North America, and instead suppose the modern cheetah to have evolved from Asian populations that eventually spread to Africa. The cheetah is thought to have experienced two population bottlenecks that greatly decreased the genetic variability in populations; one occurred about 100,000 years ago that has been correlated to migration from North America to Asia, and the second 10,000–12,000 years ago in Africa, possibly as part of the Late Pleistocene extinction event.

==Genetics==
The diploid number of chromosomes in the cheetah is 38, the same as in most other felids. The cheetah was the first felid observed to have unusually low genetic variability among individuals, which has led to poor breeding in captivity, increased spermatozoal defects, high juvenile mortality and increased susceptibility to diseases and infections. A prominent instance was the deadly feline coronavirus outbreak in a cheetah breeding facility of Oregon in 1983 which had a mortality rate of 60%, higher than that recorded for previous epizootics of feline infectious peritonitis in any felid. The remarkable homogeneity in cheetah genes has been demonstrated by experiments involving the major histocompatibility complex (MHC); unless the MHC genes are highly homogeneous in a population, skin grafts exchanged between a pair of unrelated individuals would be rejected. Skin grafts exchanged between unrelated cheetahs are accepted well and heal, as if their genetic makeup were the same.

The low genetic diversity is thought to have been created by two population bottlenecks from about 100,000 years and about 12,000 years ago, respectively. The resultant level of genetic variation is around 0.1–4% of average living species, lower than that of Tasmanian devils, Virunga gorillas, Amur tigers, and even highly inbred domestic cats and dogs.

Selective retention of gene variants (Duplication) has been found in 10 genes candidates to explain energetics and anabolism related to muscle specialization in cheetahs.

•Regulation of muscle contraction (Five genes: &quot;ADORA1&quot;, &quot;ADRA1B&quot;, &quot;CACNA1C&quot;, &quot;RGS2&quot;, &quot;SCN5A&quot;).

•Physiological stress response (Two genes: &quot;ADORA1&quot;, &quot;TAOK2&quot;). 

•Negative regulation of catabolic process (Four genes: &quot;APOC3&quot;, &quot;SUFU&quot;, &quot;DDIT4&quot;, &quot;PPARA&quot;).

Potentially harmful mutations has been found in a gene related to spermatogenesis (&quot;AKAP4&quot;). This could explain the high proportion of abnormal sperma in male cheetahs and poor reproductive success in the species.

===King cheetah===
The king cheetah is a variety of cheetah with a rare mutation for cream-coloured fur marked with large, blotchy spots and three dark, wide stripes extending from the neck to the tail. In Manicaland, Zimbabwe, it was known as &quot;nsuifisi&quot; and thought to be a cross between a leopard and a hyena. In 1926, Major A. Cooper wrote about a cheetah-like animal he had shot near modern-day Harare, with fur as thick as that of a snow leopard and spots that merged to form stripes. He suggested it could be a cross between a leopard and a cheetah. As more such individuals were observed it was seen that they had non-retractable claws like the cheetah.

In 1927, Pocock described these individuals as a new species by the name of &quot;Acinonyx rex&quot; (&quot;king cheetah&quot;). However, in the absence of proof to support his claim, he withdrew his proposal in 1939. Abel Chapman considered it a colour morph of the normally spotted cheetah. Since 1927, the king cheetah has been reported five more times in the wild in Zimbabwe, Botswana and northern Transvaal; one was photographed in 1975.

In 1981, two female cheetahs that had mated with a wild male from Transvaal at the De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre (South Africa) gave birth to one king cheetah each; subsequently, more king cheetahs were born at the centre. In 2012, the cause of this coat pattern was found to be a mutation in the gene for transmembrane aminopeptidase (Taqpep), the same gene responsible for the striped &quot;mackerel&quot; versus blotchy &quot;classic&quot; pattern seen in tabby cats. The appearance is caused by reinforcement of a recessive allele; hence if two mating cheetahs are heterozygous carriers of the mutated allele, a quarter of their offspring can be expected to be king cheetahs.

==Characteristics==


The cheetah is a lightly built, spotted cat characterised by a small rounded head, a short snout, black tear-like facial streaks, a deep chest, long thin legs and a long tail. Its slender, canine-like form is highly adapted for speed, and contrasts sharply with the robust build of the genus &quot;Panthera&quot;. Cheetahs typically reach at the shoulder and the head-and-body length is between . The weight can vary with age, health, location, sex and subspecies; adults typically range between . Cubs born in the wild weigh at birth, while those born in captivity tend to be larger and weigh around . The cheetah is sexually dimorphic, with males larger and heavier than females, but not to the extent seen in other large cats; females have a much lower body mass index than males. Studies differ significantly on morphological variations among the subspecies.

The coat is typically tawny to creamy white or pale buff (darker in the mid-back portion). The chin, throat and underparts of the legs and the belly are white and devoid of markings. The rest of the body is covered with around 2,000 evenly spaced, oval or round solid black spots, each measuring roughly . Each cheetah has a distinct pattern of spots which can be used to identify unique individuals. Besides the clearly visible spots, there are other faint, irregular black marks on the coat. Newly born cubs are covered in fur with an unclear pattern of spots that gives them a dark appearance—pale white above and nearly black on the underside. The hair is mostly short and often coarse, but the chest and the belly are covered in soft fur; the fur of king cheetahs has been reported to be silky. There is a short, rough mane, covering at least along the neck and the shoulders; this feature is more prominent in males. The mane starts out as a cape of long, loose blue to grey hair in juveniles. Melanistic cheetahs are rare and have been seen in Zambia and Zimbabwe. In 1877–1878, Sclater described two partially albino specimens from South Africa.

The head is small and more rounded compared to other big cats. Saharan cheetahs have canine-like slim faces. The ears are small, short and rounded; they are tawny at the base and on the edges and marked with black patches on the back. The eyes are set high and have round pupils. The whiskers, shorter and fewer than those of other felids, are fine and inconspicuous. The pronounced tear streaks (or malar stripes), unique to the cheetah, originate from the corners of the eyes and run down the nose to the mouth. The role of these streaks is not well understood—they may protect the eyes from the sun&#x27;s glare (a helpful feature as the cheetah hunts mainly during the day), or they could be used to define facial expressions. The exceptionally long and muscular tail, with a bushy white tuft at the end, measures . While the first two-thirds of the tail are covered in spots, the final third is marked with four to six dark rings or stripes.

The cheetah is superficially similar to the leopard, which has a larger head, fully retractable claws, rosettes instead of spots, lacks tear streaks and is more muscular. Moreover, the cheetah is taller than the leopard. The serval also resembles the cheetah in physical build, but is significantly smaller, has a shorter tail and its spots fuse to form stripes on the back. The cheetah appears to have evolved convergently with canids in morphology and behaviour; it has canine-like features such as a relatively long snout, long legs, a deep chest, tough paw pads and blunt, semi-retractable claws. The cheetah has often been likened to the greyhound, as both have similar morphology and the ability to reach tremendous speeds in a shorter time than other mammals, but the cheetah can attain much higher maximum speeds.

===Internal anatomy===

Sharply contrasting with the other big cats in its morphology, the cheetah shows several specialized adaptations for prolonged chases to catch prey at some of the fastest speeds reached by land animals. Its light, streamlined body makes it well-suited to short, explosive bursts of speed, rapid acceleration, and an ability to execute extreme changes in direction while moving at high speed. The large nasal passages, accommodated well due to the smaller size of the canine teeth, ensure fast flow of sufficient air, and the enlarged heart and lungs allow the enrichment of blood with oxygen in a short time. This allows cheetahs to rapidly regain their stamina after a chase. During a typical chase, their respiratory rate increases from 60 to 150 breaths per minute. The cheetah has a fast heart rate, averaging 126–173 beats per minute at resting without arrhythmia. Moreover, the reduced viscosity of the blood at higher temperatures (common in frequently moving muscles) could ease blood flow and increase oxygen transport. While running, in addition to having good traction due to their semi-retractable claws, cheetahs use their tail as a rudder-like means of steering that enables them to make sharp turns, necessary to outflank antelopes which often change direction to escape during a chase. The protracted claws increase grip over the ground, while rough paw pads make the sprint more convenient over tough ground. The limbs of the cheetah are longer than what is typical for other cats its size; the thigh muscles are large, and the tibia and fibula are held close together making the lower legs less likely to rotate. This reduces the risk of losing balance during runs, but compromises the cat&#x27;s ability to climb trees. The highly reduced clavicle is connected through ligaments to the scapula, whose pendulum-like motion increases the stride length and assists in shock absorption. The extension of the vertebral column can add as much as to the stride length.

Muscle tissue has been analyzed in the cheetah and it has been found that there are little differences in type IIx muscle fibers concentration, anaerobic LDH enzyme activity, as well glycogen concentration between sexes, in contrast to humans where women had LDH activity much lower that men, although type IIx muscle fibers concentration were similar. Cheetah males had larger cross-sectional area fibers. 
The cheetah resembles the smaller cats in cranial features, and in having a long and flexible spine, as opposed to the stiff and short one in other large felids. The roughly triangular skull has light, narrow bones and the sagittal crest is poorly developed, possibly to reduce weight and enhance speed. The mouth can not be opened as widely as in other cats given the shorter length of muscles between the jaw and the skull. A study suggested that the limited retraction of the cheetah&#x27;s claws may result from the earlier truncation of the development of the middle phalanx bone in cheetahs.

The cheetah has a total of 30 teeth; the dental formula is . The small, flat canines are used to bite the throat and suffocate the prey. A study gave the bite force quotient (BFQ) of the cheetah as 119, close to that for the lion (112), suggesting that adaptations for a lighter skull may not have reduced the power of the cheetah&#x27;s bite. Unlike other cats, the cheetah&#x27;s canines have no gap or diastema behind them when the jaws close, as the top and bottom cheek teeth show extensive overlap. Cheetahs have relatively elongated, blade-like shape carnassial teeth, with reduced lingual cusps; this may have been an adaptation to consume quickly the flesh of a prey before more heavy-built predators from other species arrive to take it from them. The slightly curved claws, shorter and straighter than those of other cats, lack a protective sheath and are partly retractable. The claws are blunt due to lack of protection, but the large and strongly curved dewclaw is remarkably sharp. Cheetahs have a high concentration of nerve cells arranged in a band in the centre of the eyes, a visual streak, the most efficient among felids. This significantly sharpens the vision and enables the cheetah to swiftly locate prey against the horizon. The cheetah is unable to roar due to the presence of a sharp-edged vocal fold within the larynx.

In stressful situations, the cheetah has a lower cortisol level than the leopard, indicating better stress response; it also has lower immunoglobulin G and Serum amyloid A levels but a higher lysozyme level and a higher bacterial killing capacity than the leopard, indicating a poorer adaptive and induced innate immune systems but a better constitutive innate immune system; its constitutive innate immune system compensates for its low variation of major histocompatibility complex and poorer immune adaptability.

===Speed and acceleration===
The cheetah is the world&#x27;s fastest land animal. Estimates of the maximum speed attained range from . A commonly quoted value is , recorded in 1957, but this measurement is disputed. In 2012, an 11-year-old cheetah from the Cincinnati Zoo set a world record by running in 5.95 seconds over a set run, recording a maximum speed of .

Cheetahs equipped with GPS collars hunted at speeds during most of the chase much lower than the highest recorded speed; their run was interspersed with a few short bursts of a few seconds when they attained peak speeds. The average speed recorded during the high speed phase was , or within the range including error. The highest recorded value was . A hunt consists of two phases, an initial fast acceleration phase when the cheetah tries to catch up with the prey, followed by slowing down as it closes in on it, the deceleration varying by the prey in question. The initial linear acceleration observed was 13 m/s², more than twice than 6 m/s² of horses and greater than 10 m/s² of greyhounds. Cheetahs can increase up 3 m/s (10.8 km/h) and decrease up 4 m/s (14.4 km/h) in a single stride. Speed and acceleration values for a hunting cheetah may be different from those for a non-hunter because while engaged in the chase, the cheetah is more likely to be twisting and turning and may be running through vegetation. The speeds attained by the cheetah may be only slightly greater than those achieved by the pronghorn at and the springbok at , but the cheetah additionally has an exceptional acceleration.

One stride of a galloping cheetah measures ; the stride length and the number of jumps increases with speed. During more than half the duration of the sprint, the cheetah has all four limbs in the air, increasing the stride length. Running cheetahs can retain up to 90% of the heat generated during the chase. A 1973 study suggested the length of the sprint is limited by excessive build-up of body heat when the body temperature reaches . However, a 2013 study recorded the average temperature of cheetahs after hunts to be , suggesting high temperatures need not cause hunts to be abandoned.

The running speed of of the cheetah was obtained as an result of a single run of one individual by dividing the distance traveled for time spent. The run lasted 2.25 seconds and was supposed to have been long, but was later found to have been long. It was therefore discredited for a faulty method of measurement.
Cheetahs have subsequently been measured at running at a speed of as the fastest speed from three runs including in opposite direction, for a single individual, over a marked course, even starting the run behind the start line, starting the run already running on the course. Again dividing the distance by time, but this time to determine the maximum sustained speed, completing the runs in an time of 7.0, 6.9 and 7.2 seconds. Being a more accurate method of measurement, this test was made in 1965 but published in 1997.

In 2010, the running speed of 15 cheetahs was measured by means of high speed camera stationed on a tripod and placed at specific points on a track; the cheetahs were chasing a lure and there were several attempts per individual, and their length from the nose to base of the tail was used as a scale. The speed was estimated from the time the tip of the nose appeared until it was no longer visible on camera. The maximum speed recorded was 100.1 km/h for one individual.
Subsequently, with GPS-IMU collars, in 2011 and 2012, running speed was measured for wild cheetahs during hunts with turns and manoeuvres, and the maximum speed recorded was sustained for 1–2 seconds. The speed was obtained by dividing the length by the time between footfalls of a stride. Cheetahs can go from in less than 3 seconds. 
There are indirect ways to measure how fast a cheetah can run. One case is known of a cheetah that overtook a young male pronghorn. Cheetahs can overtake a running antelope with a head start. Both animals were clocked at by speedometer reading while running alongside a vehicle at full speed. Cheetahs can easily capture gazelles galloping at full speed ().

The physiological reasons for speed in cheetahs are:
*Small head and long lumbar region of the spine, 36.8% of the presacral vertebral column.
*A tibia and radius longer than the femur and humerus, with a femorotibial index of 101.9–105 and a humeroradial index of 100.1–103.3.
*Elongated and slender long bones of the limbs, especially femur, tibia, humerus, radius and pelvis, specially the ischium.
*A cool nose and enlarged respiratory passages that allow it to inhale and exhale more air with each breath, which helps dissipate body heat.
*A higher concentration of glycolytic fast twitch muscle fibers (Type IIx) than other cats and animals in general. A very high LDH activity is indicative of this principally anaerobic muscle metabolism.
*Most of the locomotor muscle mass is concentrated proximally close to the body in shoulders, thighs and spine, and is reduced in shins and forearms. Long tendons finish off the distal locomotor muscles.
*Muscular hindlimbs form 19.8% of the body mass, whereas the forelimbs form 15.1%. The hamstrings, quadriceps, adductor muscles of the hip and psoas major muscles are especially large. 
*Enlarged Betz cells in the motor cortex M1 and innervating muscle fibers, with longer dendrites and more numerous dendritic segments to fit predominant type IIx muscle fibers.

==Ecology and behaviour==
Cheetahs are active mainly during the day, whereas other carnivores such as leopards and lions are active mainly at night; These larger carnivores can kill cheetahs and steal their kills; hence, the diurnal tendency of cheetahs helps them avoid larger predators in areas where they are sympatric, such as the Okavango Delta. In areas where the cheetah is the major predator (such as farmlands in Botswana and Namibia), activity tends to increase at night. This may also happen in highly arid regions such as the Sahara, where daytime temperatures can reach . The lunar cycle can also influence the cheetah&#x27;s routine—activity might increase on moonlit nights as prey can be sighted easily, though this comes with the danger of encountering larger predators. Hunting is the major activity throughout the day, with peaks during dawn and dusk. Groups rest in grassy clearings after dusk. Cheetahs often inspect their vicinity at observation points such as elevations to check for prey or larger carnivores; even while resting, they take turns at keeping a lookout.

===Social organisation===
Cheetahs have a flexible and complex social structure and tend to be more gregarious than several other cats (except the lion). Individuals typically avoid one another but are generally amicable; males may fight over territories or access to females in oestrus, and on rare occasions such fights can result in severe injury and death. Females are not social and have minimal interaction with other individuals, barring the interaction with males when they enter their territories or during the mating season. Some females, generally mother and offspring or siblings, may rest beside one another during the day. Females tend to lead a solitary life or live with offspring in undefended home ranges; young females often stay close to their mothers for life but young males leave their mother&#x27;s range to live elsewhere.

Some males are territorial, and group together for life, forming coalitions that collectively defend a territory which ensures maximum access to females—this is unlike the behaviour of the male lion who mates with a particular group (pride) of females. In most cases, a coalition will consist of brothers born in the same litter who stayed together after weaning, but biologically unrelated males are often allowed into the group; in the Serengeti, 30% of members in coalitions are unrelated males. If a cub is the only male in a litter, he will typically join an existing group, or form a small group of solitary males with two or three other lone males who may or may not be territorial. In the Kalahari Desert around 40% of the males live in solitude.

Males in a coalition are affectionate toward each other, grooming mutually and calling out if any member is lost; unrelated males may face some aversion in their initial days in the group. All males in the coalition typically have equal access to kills when the group hunts together, and possibly also to females who may enter their territory. A coalition generally has a greater chance of encountering and acquiring females for mating; however, its large membership demands greater resources than do solitary males. A 1987 study showed that solitary and grouped males have a nearly equal chance of coming across females, but the males in coalitions are notably healthier and have better chances of survival than their solitary counterparts.

===Home ranges and territories===
Unlike many other felids, among cheetahs, females tend to occupy larger areas compared to males. Females typically disperse over large areas in pursuit of prey, but they are less nomadic and roam in a smaller area if prey availability in the area is high. As such, the size of their home range depends on the distribution of prey in a region. In central Namibia, where most prey species are sparsely distributed, home ranges average , whereas in the woodlands of the Phinda Game Reserve (South Africa), which have plentiful prey, home ranges are in size. Cheetahs can travel long stretches overland in search of food; a study in the Kalahari Desert recorded an average displacement of nearly every day and walking speeds ranged between .

Males are generally less nomadic than females; often males in coalitions (and sometimes solitary males staying far from coalitions) establish territories. Whether males settle in territories or disperse over large areas forming home ranges depends primarily on the movements of females. Territoriality is preferred only if females tend to be more sedentary, which is more feasible in areas with plenty of prey. Some males, called floaters, switch between territoriality and nomadism depending on the availability of females. A 1987 study showed territoriality depended on the size and age of males and the membership of the coalition. The ranges of floaters averaged in the Serengeti to in central Namibia. In the Kruger National Park (South Africa) territories were much smaller. A coalition of three males occupied a territory measuring , and the territory of a solitary male measured . When a female enters a territory, the males will surround her; if she tries to escape, the males will bite or snap at her. Generally, the female can not escape on her own; the males themselves leave after they lose interest in her. They may smell the spot she was sitting or lying on to determine if she was in oestrus.

===Communication===

The cheetah is a vocal felid with a broad repertoire of calls and sounds; the acoustic features and the use of many of these have been studied in detail. The vocal characteristics, such as the way they are produced, are often different from those of other cats. For instance, a study showed that exhalation is louder than inhalation in cheetahs, while no such distinction was observed in the domestic cat. Listed below are some commonly recorded vocalisations observed in cheetahs:

* Chirping: A chirp (or a &quot;stutter-bark&quot;) is an intense bird-like call and lasts less than a second. Cheetahs chirp when they are excited, for instance, when gathered around a kill. Other uses include summoning concealed or lost cubs by the mother, or as a greeting or courtship between adults. The cheetah&#x27;s chirp is similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter&#x27;s loud roar. A similar but louder call (&#x27;yelp&#x27;) can be heard from up to away; this call is typically used by mothers to locate lost cubs, or by cubs to find their mothers and siblings.
* Churring (or churtling): A churr is a shrill, staccato call that can last up to two seconds. Churring and chirping have been noted for their similarity to the soft and loud roars of the lion. It is produced in similar context as chirping, but a study of feeding cheetahs found chirping to be much more common.
* Purring: Similar to purring in domestic cats but much louder, it is produced when the cheetah is content, and as a form of greeting or when licking one another. It involves continuous sound production alternating between egressive and ingressive airstreams.
* Agonistic sounds: These include bleating, coughing, growling, hissing, meowing and moaning (or yowling). A bleat indicates distress, for instance when a cheetah confronts a predator that has stolen its kill. Growls, hisses and moans are accompanied by multiple, strong hits on the ground with the front paw, during which the cheetah may retreat by a few metres. A meow, though a versatile call, is typically associated with discomfort or irritation.
* Other vocalisations: Individuals can make a gurgling noise as part of a close, amicable interaction. A &quot;nyam nyam&quot; sound may be produced while eating. Apart from chirping, mothers can use a repeated &quot;ihn ihn&quot; is to gather cubs, and a &quot;prr prr&quot; is to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still. Bickering cubs can let out a &quot;whirr&quot;—the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel and ends on a harsh note.

Another major means of communication is by scent—the male will often raise his tail and spray urine on elevated landmarks such as a tree trunks, stumps or rocks; other cheetahs will sniff these landmarks and repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behaviour but less prominently than males do. Females in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and their excrement can attract males from far off. In Botswana, cheetahs are frequently captured by ranchers to protect livestock by setting up traps in traditional marking spots; the calls of the trapped cheetah can attract more cheetahs to the place.

Touch and visual cues are other ways of signalling in cheetahs. Social meetings involve mutual sniffing of the mouth, anus and genitals. Individuals will groom one another, lick each other&#x27;s faces and rub cheeks. However, they seldom lean on or rub their flanks against each other. The tear streaks on the face can sharply define expressions at close range. Mothers probably use the alternate light and dark rings on the tail to signal their cubs to follow them.

===Diet and hunting===
The cheetah is a carnivore that hunts small to medium-sized prey weighing , but mostly less than . Its primary prey are medium-sized ungulates. They are the major component of the diet in certain areas, such as Dama and Dorcas gazelles in the Sahara, impala in the eastern and southern African woodlands, springbok in the arid savannas to the south and Thomson&#x27;s gazelle in the Serengeti. Smaller antelopes like the common duiker are frequent prey in the southern Kalahari. Larger ungulates are typically avoided, though nyala, whose males weigh around , were found to be the major prey in a study in the Phinda Game Reserve. In Namibia cheetahs are the major predators of livestock. The diet of the Asiatic cheetah consists of chinkara, desert hare, goitered gazelle, urial, wild goats, and livestock; in India cheetahs used to prey mostly on blackbuck.

Prey preferences and hunting success vary with the age, sex and number of cheetahs involved in the hunt and on the vigilance of the prey. Generally, only groups of cheetahs (coalitions or mother and cubs) will try to kill larger prey; mothers with cubs especially look out for larger prey and tend to be more successful than females without cubs. Individuals on the periphery of the prey herd are common targets; vigilant prey which would react quickly on seeing the cheetah are not preferred.

Cheetahs are one of the most iconic pursuit predators, hunting primarily throughout the day, sometimes with peaks at dawn and dusk; they tend to avoid larger predators like the primarily nocturnal lion. Cheetahs in the Sahara and Maasai Mara in Kenya hunt after sunset to escape the high temperatures of the day. Cheetahs use their vision to hunt instead of their sense of smell; they keep a lookout for prey from resting sites or low branches. The cheetah will stalk its prey, trying to conceal itself in cover, and approach as close as possible, often within of the prey (or even closer for less alert prey). Alternatively the cheetah can lie hidden in cover and wait for the prey to come nearer. A stalking cheetah assumes a partially crouched posture, with the head lower than the shoulders; it will move slowly and be still at times. In areas of minimal cover, the cheetah will approach within of the prey and start the chase. The chase typically lasts a minute; in a 2013 study, the length of chases averaged , and the longest run measured . The cheetah can give up the chase if it is detected by the prey early or if it cannot make a kill quickly. Being lightly built, cheetahs lack the raw strength to tackle down the prey, and instead catch the prey by performing a kind of foot sweep by hitting the prey&#x27;s leg or rump with the forepaw or using the strong dewclaw to knock the prey off its balance. Such a fall during a high-speed chase may cause the prey to collapse hard enough to break some of its limbs, and allow the cheetah to then pounce on the fallen and vulnerable prey.

Cheetahs can decelerate dramatically towards the end of the hunt, slowing down from to in just three strides, and can easily follow any twists and turns the prey makes as it tries to flee. To kill medium- to large-sized prey, the cheetah bites the prey&#x27;s throat to strangle it, maintaining the bite for around five minutes, within which the prey succumbs to asphyxiation and stops struggling. A bite on the nape of the neck or the snout (and sometimes on the skull) suffices to kill smaller prey. Cheetahs have an average hunting success rate of 25–40%, higher for smaller and more vulnerable prey.

Once the hunt is over, the prey is taken near a bush or under a tree; the cheetah, highly exhausted after the chase, rests beside the kill and pants heavily for five to 55 minutes. Meanwhile, cheetahs nearby, who did not take part in the hunt, might feed on the kill immediately. Groups of cheetah consume the kill peacefully, though minor noises and snapping may be observed. Cheetahs can consume large quantities of food; a cheetah at the Etosha National Park (Namibia) was found to consume as much as within two hours. However, on a daily basis, a cheetah feeds on around of meat. Cheetahs, especially mothers with cubs, remain cautious even as they eat, pausing to look around for vultures and predators who may steal the kill.

Cheetahs move their heads from side to side so the sharp carnassial teeth tear the flesh, which can then be swallowed without chewing. They typically begin with the hindquarters where the tissue is the softest, and then progress toward the abdomen and the spine. Ribs are chewed on at the ends, and the limbs are not generally torn apart while eating. Unless the prey is very small, the skeleton is left almost intact after feeding on the meat. Cheetahs might lose up 13–14% of their kills to larger and stronger carnivores. To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground and snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses and growls, and hitting the ground with the forepaws. Although uncommon, cases of wild cheetahs scavenging carcasses that not hunt themselves have been observed; even one case of a cheetah stealing a spotted hyena kill is known. Causes of this scavenging behavior are unclear.

Cheetahs appear to have a comparatively higher hunting success rate than other predators. Their success rate for hunting Thomson gazelles is 70%, whereas the success rate of African wild dogs is 57%, of spotted hyenas 33%, and of lions 26%. Their success rate for hunting impalas is 26%, but of African wild dogs only 15.5%.

===Reproduction and life cycle===
The cheetah breeds throughout the year; females are polyestrous and induced ovulators with an estrous cycle of 12 days on average that can vary from three days to a month. They have their first litter at two to three years of age and can conceive again after 17 to 20 months from giving birth, or even sooner if a whole litter is lost. Males can breed at less than two years of age in captivity, but this may be delayed in the wild until the male acquires a territory. A 2007 study showed that females who gave birth to more litters early in their life often died younger, indicating a trade-off between longevity and yearly reproductive success.

Urine-marking in males can become more pronounced when a female in their vicinity comes into estrus. Males, sometimes even those in coalitions, fight among one another to secure access to the female. Often one male will eventually win dominance over the others and mate with the female, though a female can mate with different males. Mating begins with the male approaching the female, who lies down on the ground; individuals often chirp, purr or yelp at this time. No courtship behaviour is observed; the male immediately secures hold of the female&#x27;s nape, and copulation takes place. The pair then ignore each other, but meet and copulate a few more times three to five times a day for the next two to three days before finally parting ways.

After a gestation of nearly three months, a litter of one to eight cubs is born (though those of three to four cubs are more common). Births take place at 20–25 minute intervals in a sheltered place such as thick vegetation. The eyes are shut at birth, and open in four to 11 days. Newborn cubs might spit a lot and make soft churring noises; they start walking by two weeks. Their nape, shoulders and back are thickly covered with long bluish-grey hair, called a mantle, which gives them a mohawk-type appearance; this fur is shed as the cheetah grows older. A study suggested that this mane gives a cheetah cub the appearance of a honey badger, and could act as camouflage from attacks by these badgers or predators that tend to avoid them.

Compared to other felids, cheetah cubs are highly vulnerable to several predators during the first few weeks of their life. Mothers keep their cubs hidden in dense vegetation for the first two months and nurse in the early morning. The mother is extremely vigilant at this stage; she stays within of the lair, frequently visits her cubs, moves them every five to six days, and remains with them after dark. Despite trying to make minimal noise, she cannot generally defend her litter from predators. Predation is the leading cause of mortality in cheetah cubs; a study showed that in areas with a low density of predators (such as Namibian farmlands) around 70% of the cubs make it beyond the age of 14 months, whereas in areas like the Serengeti National Park, where several large carnivores exist, the survival rate was just 17%. Deaths also occur from starvation if their mothers abandon them, fires, or pneumonia because of exposure to bad weather. Generation length of the cheetah is six years.

Cubs start coming out of the lair at two months of age, trailing after their mother wherever she goes. At this point the mother nurses less and brings solid food to the cubs; they retreat away from the carcass in fear initially, but gradually start eating it. The cubs might purr as the mother licks them clean after the meal. Weaning occurs at four to six months. To train her cubs in hunting, the mother will catch and let go of live prey in front of her cubs. Cubs&#x27; play behaviour includes chasing, crouching, pouncing and wrestling; there is plenty of agility, and attacks are seldom lethal. Playing can improve catching skills in cubs, though the ability to crouch and hide may not develop remarkably.

Cubs as young as six months try to capture small prey like hares and young gazelles. However, they may have to wait until as long as 15 months of age to make a successful kill on their own. At around 20 months, offspring become independent; mothers might have conceived again by then. Siblings may remain together for a few more months before parting ways. While females stay close to their mothers, males move farther off. The lifespan of wild cheetahs is 14 to 15 years for females, and their reproductive cycle typically ends by 12 years of age; males generally live as long as ten years.

==Distribution and habitat ==
In eastern and southern Africa, the cheetah occurs mostly in savannas like the Kalahari and Serengeti. In central, northern and western Africa, it inhabits arid mountain ranges and valleys; in the harsh climate of the Sahara, it prefers high mountains, which receive more rainfall than the surrounding desert. The vegetation and water resources in these mountains support antelopes. In Iran, it occurs in hilly terrain of deserts at elevations up to , where annual precipitation is generally below ; the primary vegetation in these areas is thinly distributed shrubs, less than tall.

The cheetah inhabits a variety of ecosystems and appears to be less selective in habitat choice than other felids; it prefers areas with greater availability of prey, good visibility and minimal chances of encountering larger predators. It seldom occurs in tropical forests. It has been reported at the elevation of . An open area with some cover, such as diffused bushes, is probably ideal for the cheetah because it needs to stalk and pursue its prey over a distance. This also minimises the risk of encountering larger carnivores. The cheetah tends to occur in low densities typically between 0.3 and 3.0 adults per ; these values are 10–30% of those reported for leopards and lions.

===Historical range===
In prehistoric times, the cheetah was distributed throughout Africa, Asia and Europe. It gradually fell to extinction in Europe, possibly because of competition with the lion. Today the cheetah has been extirpated in most of its historical range; the numbers of the Asiatic cheetah had begun plummeting since the late 1800s, long before the other subspecies started their decline. As of 2017, cheetahs occur in just nine per cent of their erstwhile range in Africa, mostly in unprotected areas.

In the past until the mid-20th century, the cheetah ranged across vast stretches in Asia, from the Arabian Peninsula in the west to the Indian subcontinent in the east, and as far north as the Aral and Caspian Seas. A few centuries ago the cheetah was abundant in India, and its range coincided with the distribution of major prey like the blackbuck. However, its numbers in India plummeted from the 19th century onward; Divyabhanusinh of the Bombay Natural History Society notes that the last three individuals in the wild were killed by Maharaja Ramanuj Pratap Singh of Surguja in 1947. The last confirmed sighting in India was of a cheetah that drowned in a well near Hyderabad in 1957. In Iran there were around 400 cheetahs before World War II, distributed across deserts and steppes to the east and the borderlands with Iraq to the west; the numbers were falling because of a decline in prey. In Iraq, cheetahs were reported from Basra in the 1920s. Conservation efforts in the 1950s stabilised the population, but prey species declined again in the wake of the Iranian Revolution (1979) and the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988), leading to a significant contraction of the cheetah&#x27;s historical range in the region.

In 1975, the cheetah population was estimated at 15,000 individuals throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, following the first survey in this region by Norman Myers. The range covered most of eastern and southern Africa, except for the desert region on the western coast of modern-day Angola and Namibia. In the following years, cheetah populations across the region have become smaller and more fragmented as their natural habitat has been modified dramatically.

===Present distribution===
The cheetah occurs mostly in eastern and southern Africa; its presence in Asia is limited to the central deserts of Iran, though there have been unconfirmed reports of sightings in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan in the last few decades. The global population of cheetahs was estimated at nearly 7,100 mature individuals in 2016. The Iranian population appears to have decreased from 60–100 individuals in 2007 to 43 in 2016, distributed in three subpopulations over less than in Iran&#x27;s central plateau. The largest population of nearly 4,000 individuals is sparsely distributed over Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zambia. Another population in Kenya and Tanzania comprises about 1,000 individuals. All other cheetahs occur in small, fragmented groups of less than 100 individuals each. Populations are thought to be declining.

==Threats==
The cheetah is threatened by several factors, like habitat loss and fragmentation of populations. Habitat loss is caused mainly by the introduction of commercial land use, such as agriculture and industry. It is further aggravated by ecological degradation, like woody plant encroachment, which is common in southern Africa. Moreover, the species apparently requires a sizeable area to live in as indicated by its low population densities. Shortage of prey and conflict with other species such as humans and large carnivores are other major threats. The cheetah appears to be less capable of coexisting with humans than the leopard. With 76% of its range consisting of unprotected land, the cheetah is often targeted by farmers and pastoralists who attempt to protect their livestock, especially in Namibia. Illegal wildlife trade and trafficking is another problem in some places (like Ethiopia). Some tribes, like the Maasai people in Tanzania, have been reported to use cheetah skins in ceremonies. Roadkill is another threat, especially in areas where roads have been constructed near natural habitat or protected areas. Cases of roadkill involving cheetahs have been reported from Kalmand, Touran National Park, and Bafq in Iran. The reduced genetic variability makes cheetahs more vulnerable to diseases; however, the threat posed by infectious diseases may be minor, given the low population densities and hence a reduced chance of infection.

==Conservation==
The cheetah has been classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN; it is listed under AppendixI of the CMS and AppendixI of CITES. The Endangered Species Act enlists the cheetah as Endangered.

===In Africa===
Until the 1970s, cheetahs and other carnivores were frequently killed to protect livestock in Africa. Gradually the understanding of cheetah ecology increased and their falling numbers became a matter of concern. The De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre was set up in 1971 in South Africa to provide care for wild cheetahs regularly trapped or injured by Namibian farmers. By 1987, the first major research project to outline cheetah conservation strategies was underway. The Cheetah Conservation Fund, founded in 1990 in Namibia, put efforts into field research and education about cheetahs on the global platform. The CCF runs a cheetah genetics laboratory, the only one of its kind, in Otjiwarongo (Namibia); &quot;Bushblok&quot; is an initiative to restore habitat systematically through targeted bush thinning and biomass utilisation. Several more cheetah-specific conservation programmes have since been established, like Cheetah Outreach in South Africa.

The Global Cheetah Action Plan Workshop in 2002 laid emphasis on the need for a range-wide survey of wild cheetahs to demarcate areas for conservation efforts and on creating awareness through training programs. The Range Wide Conservation Program for Cheetah and African Wild Dogs (RWCP) began in 2007 as a joint initiative of the IUCN Cat and Canid Specialist Groups, the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Zoological Society of London. National conservation plans have been developed successfully for several African countries. In 2014, the CITES Standing Committee recognised the cheetah as a &quot;species of priority&quot; in their strategies in northeastern Africa to counter wildlife trafficking. In December 2016 the results of an extensive survey detailing the distribution and demography of cheetahs throughout the range were published; the researchers recommended listing the cheetah as Endangered on the IUCN Red List.

The cheetah was reintroduced in Malawi in 2017.

===In Asia===

In 2001, the Iranian government collaborated with the CCF, the IUCN, Panthera Corporation, UNDP and the Wildlife Conservation Society on the Conservation of Asiatic Cheetah Project (CACP) to protect the natural habitat of the Asiatic cheetah and its prey. In 2004, the Iranian Centre for Sustainable Development (CENESTA) conducted an international workshop to discuss conservation plans with local stakeholders. Iran declared 31August as National Cheetah Day in 2006. The Iranian Cheetah Strategic Planning meet in 2010 formulated a five-year conservation plan for Asiatic cheetahs. The CACP Phase II was implemented in 2009, and the third phase was drafted in 2018.

During the early 2000s scientists from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (Hyderabad) proposed a plan to clone Asiatic cheetahs from Iran for reintroduction in India, but Iran denied the proposal. In September 2009, the Minister of Environment and Forests assigned the Wildlife Trust of India and the Wildlife Institute of India with examining the potential of importing African cheetahs to India. Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary and Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary were suggested as reintroduction sites for the cheetah because of their high prey density. However, plans for reintroduction were stalled in May 2012 by the Supreme Court of India because of a political dispute and concerns over introducing a non-native species to the country. Opponents stated the plan was &quot;not a case of intentional movement of an organism into a part of its native range&quot;. On 28 January 2020, the Supreme Court allowed the central government to introduce cheetahs to a suitable habitat in India on an experimental basis to see if they can adapt to it. In 2020, India signed a memorandum of understanding with Namibia as part of Project Cheetah. In July 2022, it was announced that eight cheetahs would be transferred from Namibia to India in August. The eight cheetahs were released into Kuno on 17 September 2022, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Since their introduction, 17 cubs have been born in India. However, as of September 2024, eight adult cheetahs and four cubs have already died.

==Interaction with humans==
===Taming===

The cheetah shows little aggression toward humans, and can be tamed easily, as it has been since antiquity. The earliest known depictions of the cheetah are from the Chauvet Cave in France, dating back to 32,000–26,000 BC. According to historians such as Heinz Friederichs and , the cheetah was first tamed in Sumer and this gradually spread out to central and northern Africa, from where it reached India. The evidence for this is mainly pictorial; for instance, a Sumerian seal dating back to , featuring a long-legged leashed animal has fueled speculation that the cheetah was first tamed in Sumer. However, Thomas Allsen argues that the depicted animal might be a large dog. Other historians, such as Frederick Zeuner, have opined that ancient Egyptians were the first to tame the cheetah, from where it gradually spread into central Asia, Iran and India.

In comparison, theories of the cheetah&#x27;s taming in Egypt are stronger and include timelines proposed on this basis. Mafdet, one of the ancient Egyptian deities worshiped during the First Dynasty (3100–2900BC), was sometimes depicted as a cheetah. Ancient Egyptians believed the spirits of deceased pharaohs were taken away by cheetahs. Reliefs in the Deir el-Bahari temple complex tell of an expedition by Egyptians to the Land of Punt during the reign of Hatshepsut (1507–1458BC) that fetched, among other things, animals called &quot;panthers&quot;. During the New Kingdom (16th to 11th centuries BC), cheetahs were common pets for royalty, who adorned them with ornate collars and leashes. Rock carvings depicting cheetahs dating back to 2000–6000 years ago have been found in Twyfelfontein; little else has been discovered in connection to the taming of cheetahs (or other cats) in southern Africa.

Hunting cheetahs are known in pre-Islamic Arabic art from Yemen. Hunting with cheetahs became more prevalent toward the seventh centuryAD. In the Middle East, the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in a special seat on the back of the saddle. Taming was an elaborate process and could take a year to complete. The Romans may have referred to the cheetah as the () or (), believing it to be a hybrid between a leopard and a lion because of the mantle seen in cheetah cubs and the difficulty of breeding them in captivity. A Roman hunting cheetah is depicted in a 4th-century mosaic from Lod, Israel. Cheetahs continued to be used into the Byzantine period of the Roman empire, with &quot;hunting leopards&quot; being mentioned in the &quot;Cynegetica&quot; (283/284 AD).

In eastern Asia, records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the Tang dynasty (7th to 10th centuriesAD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs and cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs and caracals as gifts. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the Yuan rulers bought numerous cheetahs from the western parts of the empire and from Muslim merchants. According to the , the subsequent Ming dynasty (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. Tomb figurines from the Mongol empire, dating back to the reign of Kublai Khan (1260–1294AD), represent cheetahs on horseback. The Mughal ruler Akbar the Great (1556–1605AD) is said to have kept as many as 1000 &quot;khasa&quot; (imperial) cheetahs. His son Jahangir wrote in his memoirs, &quot;Tuzk-e-Jahangiri&quot;, that only one of them gave birth. Mughal rulers trained cheetahs and caracals in a similar way as the western Asians, and used them to hunt game, especially blackbuck. The rampant hunting severely affected the populations of wild animals in India; by 1927, cheetahs had to be imported from Africa.

===In captivity===
The first cheetah to be brought into captivity in a zoo was at the Zoological Society of London in 1829. Early captive cheetahs showed a high mortality rate, with an average lifespan of 3–4 years. After trade of wild cheetahs was delimited by the enforcement of CITES in 1975, more efforts were put into breeding in captivity; in 2014 the number of captive cheetahs worldwide was estimated at 1730 individuals, with 87% born in captivity.

Mortality under captivity is generally high; in 2014, 23% of the captive cheetahs worldwide died under one year of age, mostly within a month of birth. Deaths result from several reasons—stillbirths, birth defects, cannibalism, hypothermia, maternal neglect, and infectious diseases. Compared to other felids, cheetahs need specialised care because of their higher vulnerability to stress-induced diseases; this has been attributed to their low genetic variability and factors of captive life. Common diseases of cheetahs include feline herpesvirus, feline infectious peritonitis, gastroenteritis, glomerulosclerosis, leukoencephalopathy, myelopathy, nephrosclerosis and veno-occlusive disease. High density of cheetahs in a place, closeness to other large carnivores in enclosures, improper handling, exposure to public and frequent movement between zoos can be sources of stress for cheetahs. Recommended management practices for cheetahs include spacious and ample access to outdoors, stress minimisation by exercise and limited handling, and following proper hand-rearing protocols (especially for pregnant females).

Wild cheetahs are far more successful breeders than captive cheetahs; this has also been linked to increased stress levels in captive individuals. In a study in the Serengeti, females were found to have a 95% success rate in breeding, compared to 20% recorded for North American captive cheetahs in another study. On 26 November 2017, a female cheetah gave birth to eight cubs in the Saint Louis Zoo, setting a record for the most births recorded by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Chances of successful mating in captive males can be improved by replicating social groups such as coalitions observed in the wild.

===Attacks on humans===
There are no documented records of lethal attacks on humans by wild cheetahs. However, there have been instances of people being fatally mauled by captive cheetahs. In 2007, a 37-year-old woman from Antwerp was killed by a cheetah in a Belgian zoo after sneaking into its cage outside of visiting hours. In 2017, a three-year-old child was attacked by a captive cheetah on a farm in Philippolis, South Africa. Despite being airlifted to a hospital in Bloemfontein, the boy died from his injuries.

===In culture===
The cheetah has been widely portrayed in a variety of artistic works. In &quot;Bacchus and Ariadne&quot;, an oil painting by the 16th-century Italian painter Titian, the chariot of the Greek god Dionysus (Bacchus) is depicted as being drawn by two cheetahs. The cheetahs in the painting were previously considered to be leopards. In 1764, English painter George Stubbs commemorated the gifting of a cheetah to George III by the English Governor of Madras, Sir George Pigot in his painting &quot;Cheetah with Two Indian Attendants and a Stag&quot;. The painting depicts a cheetah, hooded and collared by two Indian servants, along with a stag it was supposed to prey upon. The 1896 painting &quot;The Caress&quot; by the 19th-century Belgian symbolist painter Fernand Khnopff is a representation of the myth of Oedipus and the Sphinx and portrays a creature with a woman&#x27;s head and a cheetah&#x27;s body.
Two cheetahs are depicted standing upright and supporting a crown in the coat of arms of the Free State (South Africa).

In 1969, Joy Adamson, of &quot;Born Free&quot; fame, wrote &quot;The Spotted Sphinx&quot;, a biography of her pet cheetah Pippa. &quot;Hussein, An Entertainment&quot;, a novel by Patrick O&#x27;Brian set in the British Raj period in India, illustrates the practice of royalty keeping and training cheetahs to hunt antelopes. The book &quot;How It Was with Dooms&quot; tells the true story of a family raising an orphaned cheetah cub named Dooms in Kenya. The 2005 film &quot;Duma&quot; was based loosely on this book. The animated series &quot;ThunderCats&quot; had a character named &quot;Cheetara&quot;, an anthropomorphic cheetah, voiced by Lynne Lipton. Comic book heroine Wonder Woman&#x27;s chief adversary is Barbara Ann Minerva alias The Cheetah.

The Bill Thomas Cheetah American racing car, a Chevrolet-based coupe first designed and driven in 1963, was an attempt to challenge Carroll Shelby&#x27;s Shelby Cobra in American sports car competition of the 1960s. Because only two dozen or fewer chassis were built, with only a dozen complete cars, the Cheetah was never homologated for competition beyond prototype status; its production ended in 1966. In 1986, Frito-Lay introduced Chester Cheetah, an anthropomorphic cheetah, as the mascot for their snack food Cheetos. The Mac OS X 10.0 was code-named &quot;Cheetah&quot;.

<text>Margaretha Geertruida MacLeod (, ; 7 August 187615 October 1917), better known by the stage name Mata Hari ( , ; , ), was a Dutch exotic dancer and courtesan who was convicted of being a spy for Germany during World War I. She was executed by firing squad in France. The idea of a beautiful exotic dancer using her powers of seduction as a spy made her name synonymous with the &quot;femme fatale&quot;. Her story has inspired books, films, and other works.

It has been said that she was convicted and condemned because the French Army needed a scapegoat, and that the files used to secure her conviction contained falsifications. Some have even stated that Mata Hari could not have been a spy and was innocent.

==Early life==
Margaretha Geertruida Zelle was born 7 August 1876 in Leeuwarden, Netherlands to Antje van der Meulen (1842–1891) and her husband, Adam Zelle (1840–1910), a hat factory owner. She had three younger brothers; Johannes Hendriks, Arie Anne, and Cornelis Coenraad. She was affectionately called &quot;M&#x27;greet&quot; by her family. Despite traditional assertions that Mata Hari was partly of Jewish, Malaysian, or Javanese, i.e., Indonesian descent, scholars conclude she had no Jewish or Asian ancestry, and both of her parents were Dutch. Her father owned a hat factory and shop, made investments in the oil industry, and became affluent enough to give Margaretha and her siblings a lavish early childhood that included exclusive schools until the age of 13.

Soon after Margaretha&#x27;s father went bankrupt in 1889, her parents divorced, and her mother died in 1891. Her father remarried in Amsterdam on 9 February 1893 to Susanna Catharina ten Hoove (1844–1913). The family fell apart, and Margaretha was sent to live with her godfather, Mr. Visser, in Sneek. She studied to be a kindergarten teacher in Leiden, but when the headmaster began to flirt with her conspicuously, she was removed from the institution by her godfather. A few months later, she fled to her uncle&#x27;s home in The Hague.

==Dutch East Indies==
At 18, Margaretha answered an advertisement in a Dutch newspaper placed by Dutch colonial army captain Rudolf MacLeod (1856–1928), who was living in what was then the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) and was looking for a wife. Margaretha married MacLeod in Amsterdam on 11 July 1895. He was the son of Captain John Brienen MacLeod (a descendant of the Gesto branch of the MacLeods of Skye, hence his Scottish surname) and his wife Baroness Dina Louisa Sweerts de Landas. The marriage enabled Zelle to move into the Dutch upper class and placed her finances on a sound footing. She moved with her husband to Malang on the east side of the island of Java, travelling out on the in May 1897. They had two children, Norman-John MacLeod (1897–1899) and Louise Jeanne MacLeod (1898–1919).
The marriage was overall a disappointment. Rudolf was an alcoholic, physically abused Margaretha, and blamed her for his lack of promotion. He openly kept a concubine, a socially accepted practice in the Dutch East Indies at the time. When Rudolf was posted to Medan, Margaretha and the children remained in Toempoeng with the family of Mr. van Rheede, the government comptroller. Friends of Margaretha&#x27;s in the Netherlands recall her writing to them around this time to say that she had taken the name &quot;Mata Hari,&quot; the word for &quot;sun&quot; in the local Indonesian language (literally, ).

At Rudolf&#x27;s urging, Margaretha returned to him, but his behavior did not change. In 1899, their children fell violently ill from complications relating to the treatment of syphilis contracted from their parents, though the family claimed an irate servant poisoned them. Jeanne survived, but Norman died. Some sources maintain that one of Rudolf&#x27;s enemies may have poisoned their supper to kill both of their children. After moving back to the Netherlands, the couple officially separated on 30 August 1902. The divorce became final in 1906, and Margaretha was awarded custody of Jeanne. Rudolf was legally required to pay child support but never did. Once when Jeanne visited Rudolf, he did not return her to her mother. Margaretha did not have the resources to fight the situation and accepted it, believing that while Rudolf had been an abusive husband, he had been a good father. Jeanne later died at the age of 21, possibly from complications related to syphilis.

==Career==
===Paris===
In 1903, Zelle moved to Paris, where she performed as a circus horse rider using the name Lady MacLeod, much to the disapproval of the Dutch MacLeods. Struggling to earn a living, she also posed as an artist&#x27;s model.

By 1904, Mata Hari rose to prominence as an exotic dancer. She was a contemporary of dancers Isadora Duncan and Ruth St. Denis, leaders in the early modern dance movement, which around the turn of the 20th century, looked to Asia and Egypt for artistic inspiration. Gabriel Astruc became her personal booking agent.

Promiscuous, flirtatious, and openly flaunting her body, Mata Hari captivated her audiences and was an overnight success from the debut of her act at the Musée Guimet on 13 March 1905. She became the long-time mistress of the millionaire industrialist Émile Étienne Guimet, who had founded the Musée. Entertainers of her era commonly invented colourful stories about their origins, and she posed as a Javanese princess of priestly Hindu birth, pretending to have been immersed in the art of sacred Indian dance since childhood. She was photographed numerous times during this period, nude or nearly so. Some of these pictures were obtained by MacLeod and strengthened his case in keeping custody of their daughter.

Mata Hari brought a carefree provocative style to the stage in her act, which garnered wide acclaim. The most celebrated segment of her act was her progressive shedding of clothing until she wore just a jeweled breastplate and some ornaments upon her arms and head. She was never seen bare-chested as she was self-conscious about having small breasts. Early in her career, she wore a bodystocking for her performances that was similar in color to her skin, but that was later omitted.

Her act was successful because it elevated erotic dance to a more respectable status and broke new ground in a style of entertainment for which Paris was later world-famous. Her style and free-willed attitude made her popular, as did her eagerness to perform in exotic and revealing clothing. She posed for provocative photos and mingled in wealthy circles. Since most Europeans at the time were unfamiliar with the Dutch East Indies, Mata Hari was thought of as exotic, and her claims were accepted as genuine. One enthusiastic French journalist wrote in a Paris newspaper that Mata Hari was &quot;so feline, extremely feminine, majestically tragic, the thousand curves and movements of her body trembling in a thousand rhythms.&quot; One journalist in Vienna wrote after seeing one of her performances that Mata Hari was &quot;slender and tall with the flexible grace of a wild animal, and with blue-black hair&quot; and that her face &quot;makes a strange foreign impression.&quot;

By about 1910, myriad imitators had arisen. Critics began to opine that the success and dazzling features of the popular Mata Hari were due to cheap exhibitionism and lacked artistic merit. Although she continued to schedule important social events throughout Europe, she was disdained by serious cultural institutions as a dancer who did not know how to dance.

Mata Hari&#x27;s career went into decline after 1912. On 13 March 1915, she performed in the last show of her career. She had begun her career relatively late as a dancer and had started putting on weight. However, by this time, she had become a successful courtesan, known more for her sensuality and eroticism than for her classical beauty. She had relationships with high-ranking military officers, politicians, and others in influential positions in many countries. Her relationships and liaisons with powerful men frequently took her across international borders. Before World War I, she was generally viewed as an artist and a free-spirited bohemian, but as war approached, she began to be seen by some as a wanton and promiscuous woman, and perhaps a dangerous seductress.

== Espionage ==
During World War I, the Netherlands remained neutral. As a Dutch subject, Zelle was thus able to cross national borders freely. To avoid the battlefields, she traveled between France and the Netherlands via Spain and Britain, and her movements inevitably attracted attention. During the war, Zelle was involved in what was described as a very intense romantic-sexual relationship with Captain Vadim Maslov, a 23-year-old Russian Staff Captain of the 1st Special Infantry Regiment serving with the French, whom she called the love of her life. Maslov was part of the 50,000-strong Russian Expeditionary Force sent to the Western Front in the spring of 1916.

In April 1916, Maslov was wounded fighting in the ill-fated Nivelles Offensive to capture the German controlled fortified Brimont mountain range, losing his sight in his left eye, which led Zelle to ask for permission to visit her wounded lover at the hospital where he was staying near the front.
As a citizen of a neutral country, Zelle would not normally be allowed near the front. Zelle was met by agents from the Deuxième Bureau who told her that she would be allowed to see Maslov if she agreed to spy for France.

Before the war, Zelle had performed as Mata Hari several times before the Crown Prince Wilhelm, eldest son of Kaiser Wilhelm II and nominally a senior German general on the Western Front. The Deuxième Bureau believed she could obtain information by seducing the Crown Prince for military secrets. In fact, his involvement was minimal, and it was German government propaganda that promoted the image of the Crown Prince as a great warrior, the worthy successor to the Hohenzollern monarchs who had made Prussia strong and powerful. They wanted to avoid publicizing that the man expected to be the next Kaiser was a playboy noted for womanizing, partying, and indulging in alcohol, who spent another portion of his time associating with far right-wing politicians, with the intent to have his father declared insane and deposed.

Unaware that the Crown Prince did not have much to do with the running of Army Group Crown Prince or the 5th Army, the Deuxième Bureau offered Zelle 1 million francs if she could seduce him and provide France with good intelligence about German plans. The fact that the Crown Prince had, before 1914, never commanded a unit larger than a regiment, and was now supposedly commanding both an army and an army group at the same time should have been a clue that his role in German decision-making was mostly nominal. Zelle&#x27;s contact with the Deuxième Bureau was Captain Georges Ladoux, who later emerged as one of her principal accusers.

In November 1916 she was traveling from Spain aboard the steamship . When the ship called at the British port of Falmouth she was arrested and taken to London, where she was interrogated at length by Sir Basil Thomson, assistant commissioner at New Scotland Yard in charge of counter-espionage. He gave an account of this in his 1922 book &quot;Queer People&quot;, saying that she eventually admitted to working for the Deuxième Bureau. Initially detained in Canon Row police station, she was then released and stayed at the Savoy Hotel. A full transcript of the interview is in Britain&#x27;s National Archives and was broadcast, with Mata Hari played by Eleanor Bron, on the independent station LBC in 1980. It is unclear if she lied on this occasion, believing the story made her sound more intriguing, or if French authorities were using her in such a way but would not acknowledge her due to the embarrassment and international backlash it could cause.

In late 1916, Zelle traveled to Madrid, where she met the German military attaché Major Arnold Kalle and asked if he could arrange a meeting with the Crown Prince. During this period, Zelle apparently offered to share French secrets with Germany in exchange for money, though whether this was because of greed or an attempt to set up a meeting with Crown Prince Wilhelm remains unclear.

In January 1917, Major Kalle transmitted radio messages to Berlin describing the helpful activities of a German spy code-named H-21, whose biography so closely matched Zelle&#x27;s that it was obvious that Agent H-21 could only be Mata Hari. The Deuxième Bureau intercepted the messages and, from the information they contained, identified H-21 as Mata Hari. The messages were in a code that German intelligence knew had already been broken by the French, suggesting that the messages were contrived to have Zelle arrested by the French.

General Walter Nicolai, the chief IC (intelligence officer) of the German Army, had grown very annoyed that Mata Hari had provided him with no intelligence worthy of the name, instead selling the Germans mere Paris gossip about the sex lives of French politicians and generals, and decided to terminate her employment by exposing her as a German spy to the French.

===Trial===

In December 1916, the Second Bureau of the French War Ministry let Mata Hari obtain the names of six Belgian agents. Five were suspected of submitting fake material and working for the Germans, while the sixth was suspected of being a double agent for Germany and France. Two weeks after Mata Hari had left Paris for a trip to Madrid, the Germans executed the double agent while the five others continued their operations. This development proved to the Second Bureau that Mata Hari had communicated the names of the six spies to the Germans.

On 13 February 1917, Mata Hari was arrested in her room at the Hotel Elysée Palace on the Champs Elysées in Paris. She was tried on 24 July, accused of spying for Germany and consequently causing the deaths of at least 50,000 soldiers. Although the French and British intelligence suspected her of spying for Germany, neither could produce definite evidence against her.

Zelle&#x27;s principal interrogator, who grilled her relentlessly, was Captain Pierre Bouchardon; he later prosecuted her at trial. Bouchardon established that much of the Mata Hari persona was invented. Far from being a Javanese princess, Zelle was Dutch, which he used as evidence of her dubious and dishonest character at her trial. Zelle admitted to Bouchardon that she had accepted 20,000 francs from a German diplomat and former lover as reimbursement for belongings taken from her by German authorities. Bouchardon claimed that this was, in fact, payment to her for spying for Germany. In the meantime, Ladoux had been preparing a case against his former agent by casting all of her activities in the worst possible light, going so far as to engage in evidence tampering.

===Scapegoat===
In 1917, France had been badly shaken by the Great Mutinies of the French Army in the spring of 1917 following the failure of the Nivelle Offensive and massive strikes. France might have collapsed from war exhaustion. Having one German spy on whom everything that went wrong with the war could be blamed was convenient for the French government. Mata Hari seemed the perfect scapegoat. The case against her received maximum publicity in the French press and led to her importance being greatly exaggerated. The Canadian historian Wesley Wark stated in a 2014 interview that Mata Hari was never an important spy but a scapegoat for French military failures that had nothing to do with her. Wark stated: &quot;They needed a scapegoat, and she was a notable target for scapegoating.&quot; The British historian Julie Wheelwright stated: &quot;She really did not pass on anything that you couldn&#x27;t find in the local newspapers in Spain.&quot; Wheelwright described Zelle as &quot;an independent woman, a divorcée, a citizen of a neutral country, a courtesan, and a dancer, which made her a perfect scapegoat for the French, who were then losing the war. She was ... held up as an example of what might happen if your morals were too loose.&quot;

Claiming her innocence, Zelle wrote letters to the Dutch Ambassador in Paris. &quot;My international connections are due [to] my work as a dancer, nothing else ... Because I really did not spy, it is terrible that I cannot defend myself.&quot; The most terrible and heartbreaking moment for Mata Hari during the trial occurred when her lover Maslov—by now deeply embittered as a result of losing his eye in combat—declined to testify for her and told her that he did not care whether she was convicted. When Zelle learned that Maslov had abandoned her, she fainted.

Her defense counsel, veteran international lawyer , faced impossible odds; he was denied permission to cross-examine the prosecution&#x27;s witnesses or to examine his witnesses directly. Bouchardon used the fact that Zelle was a woman as evidence of her guilt, saying: &quot;Without scruples, accustomed to making use of men, she is the type of woman who is born to be a spy.&quot; Zelle has often been portrayed as a femme fatale, the dangerous, seductive woman who uses her sexuality to manipulate men effortlessly, but others view her differently: in the words of the American historians Norman Polmer and Thomas Allen she was &quot;naïve and easily duped&quot;, a victim of men rather than a victimizer.

Although news reports following her execution claimed she had admitted to spying for Germany, Mata Hari made no such admission. She maintained throughout her ordeal that she had never been a German spy. At her trial, Zelle vehemently insisted that her sympathies were with the Allies and declared her passionate love of France, her adopted homeland. In October 2001, documents released from the archives of MI5 (British counter-intelligence) were used by a Dutch group, the Mata Hari Foundation, to ask the French government to exonerate Zelle as they argued that the MI5 files proved she was not guilty of the charges she was convicted of. A spokesperson from the Mata Hari Foundation argued that at most, Zelle was a low-level spy who provided no secrets to either side, stating: &quot;We believe that there are sufficient doubts concerning the dossier of information that was used to convict her to warrant re-opening the case. Maybe she wasn&#x27;t entirely innocent, but it seems clear she wasn&#x27;t the master-spy whose information sent thousands of soldiers to their deaths, as has been claimed.&quot;

===Execution===

Zelle was executed by a firing squad consisting of 12 French soldiers just before dawn on 15 October 1917. She was 41. According to an eyewitness account by British reporter Henry Wales, she was not bound and refused a blindfold. She defiantly blew a kiss to the firing squad.

A 1934 &quot;New Yorker&quot; article reported that at her execution, she wore &quot;a neat Amazonian tailored suit, especially made for the occasion, and a pair of new white gloves&quot;, though another account indicates she wore the same suit, low-cut blouse, and tricorn hat ensemble which had been picked out by her accusers for her to wear at trial, and which was still the only full, clean outfit which she had in prison. Neither description matches photographic evidence. Wales recorded her death, saying that after the volley of shots rang out, &quot;Slowly, inertly, she settled to her knees, her head up always, and without the slightest change of expression on her face. For the fraction of a second it seemed she tottered there, on her knees, gazing directly at those who had taken her life. Then she fell backward, bending at the waist, with her legs doubled up beneath her.&quot; A non-commissioned officer then walked up to her body, pulled out his revolver, and shot her in the head to make sure she was dead.

===Remains and 2017 French declassification===
Mata Hari&#x27;s body was not claimed by any family members and was accordingly used for medical study. Her head was embalmed and kept in the Museum of Anatomy in Paris. In 2000, archivists discovered that it had disappeared, possibly as early as 1954, according to curator Roger Saban, during the museum&#x27;s relocation. Her head remains missing. Records dated 1918 show that the museum also received the rest of the body, but none of the remains could later be accounted for.

Mata Hari&#x27;s sealed trial and other related documents, a total of 1,275 pages, were declassified by the French Army in 2017, one hundred years after her execution.

==Legacy==
===Museum exhibition===
The Frisian museum (Dutch: Fries Museum) in Leeuwarden, Netherlands, contains a &quot;Mata Hari Room&quot;. Included in the exhibit are two of her personal scrapbooks and an oriental rug embroidered with the footsteps of her fan dance. Located in Mata Hari&#x27;s native town, the museum is well known for researching the life and career of Leeuwarden&#x27;s world-famous citizen. The largest-ever Mata Hari exhibition was opened in the Museum of Friesland on 14 October 2017, one hundred years after her death.

Mata Hari&#x27;s birthplace is located in the building at Kelders 33. The building suffered smoke and water damage during a fire in 2013 but was later restored. Architect Silvester Adema studied old drawings of the storefront to reconstruct it as it appeared when Adam Zelle, the father of Mata Hari, had a hat shop there. In 2016, an information centre (&quot;belevingscentrum&quot;) was created in the building displaying mementos of Mata Hari.

===In popular culture===

The idea of an exotic dancer working as a lethal double agent using her powers of seduction to extract military secrets from her many lovers made Mata Hari an enduring archetype of the &quot;femme fatale&quot;.

Her life inspired several films, including:

<doc id="45611" wikidata="Q1253897" url="?curid=45611" title="Dr. Feelgood (band)">
<text>Dr. Feelgood are an English pub rock band formed in 1971. Hailing from Canvey Island, Essex, they are best known for early singles such as &quot;She Does It Right&quot;, &quot;Roxette&quot;, &quot;Back in the Night&quot; and &quot;Milk and Alcohol&quot;. Their original and distinctively British R&amp;B sound was centred on Wilko Johnson&#x27;s choppy guitar style. Along with Johnson, the initial band line-up included singer Lee Brilleaux and the rhythm section of John B. Sparks, known as &quot;Sparko&quot;, on bass guitar and John Martin, known as &quot;The Big Figure&quot;, on drums. Although their most commercially productive years were the mid to late-1970s, and in spite of Brilleaux&#x27;s death in 1994, a version of the band (featuring none of the original members) continue to tour and record.

==Career==
===Early years===

The band were formed on Canvey Island in 1971 by Johnson, Brilleaux and Sparks, who had all been members of existing R&amp;B bands, and soon added drummer John Martin. They took their name from a 1962 record by the American blues pianist and singer Willie Perryman (also known as &quot;Piano Red&quot;) called &quot;Dr. Feel-Good&quot;, which Perryman recorded under the name of Dr. Feelgood &amp; the Interns. The song was covered by several British beat groups in the 1960s, including Johnny Kidd &amp; the Pirates. The term is also a slang term for heroin or for a physician who is willing to over-prescribe drugs.

By late 1973, the band&#x27;s driving R&amp;B influence had made them one of the most popular bands on the growing London pub rock circuit, which included regular appearances at the Lord Nelson music pub venue. They recorded their debut album, &quot;Down by the Jetty&quot;, for United Artists in 1974. Like many pub rock acts, Dr. Feelgood built up a dedicated following and were known primarily for their high energy and intense live performances constantly honed through their touring and regular performances. Their studio albums such as &quot;Down by the Jetty&quot; and &quot;Malpractice&quot; (1975) added significantly to their rising popularity. 

Their breakthrough 1976 live album, &quot;Stupidity&quot;, reached number one in the UK Albums Chart (their only chart-topper). The Ramones were the opening act for the group&#x27;s May 1976 shows at the Bottom Line in New York. 

After the 1977 follow-up &quot;Sneakin&#x27; Suspicion&quot;, Johnson left the group because of conflicts with Lee Brilleaux. He was replaced by Gypie Mayo. The band with Mayo were never as popular as when Johnson was in the line-up, yet they went on to enjoy their only top ten hit single in 1979 with &quot;Milk and Alcohol&quot;. Johnson, who died in 2022, went on to form the group Solid Senders before joining Ian Dury and the Blockheads in 1980. 
===Later years===
Despite Mayo&#x27;s departure in 1981, and various subsequent line-up changes which left Brilleaux the only remaining original member, Dr. Feelgood continued touring and recording through the 1980s. The band then suffered an almost career-finishing blow when Brilleaux died of lymphoma on 7 April 1994.

As Brilleaux had insisted prior to his death, Dr. Feelgood reunited in May 1995, initially with vocalist Pete Gage (not to be confused with guitarist Pete Gage of Geno Washington and Vinegar Joe), and recommenced touring in 1996. Though the band contained no original members at this point, the musicians backing Gage had all previously played as members of Dr. Feelgood for at least five years, and in some cases for over a decade. In 1999, Gage was replaced by Robert Kane, formerly of the Animals II and the Alligators, who celebrated his 1,000th gig as the frontman of Dr. Feelgood in April 2007.

Every year after Brilleaux&#x27;s death, a special concert known as the Lee Brilleaux Birthday Memorial was held on Canvey Island, where former and current Feelgoods celebrated the music of Dr. Feelgood, and raised money for The Fair Havens Hospice in Westcliff-on-Sea. Fans attended from all over the globe, and the 20th and final event was held on 9 May 2014. Still based in the UK, Dr. Feelgood continue to play across the world, with concerts in 2010 in Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Switzerland.
Band manager Chris Fenwick organises an annual walk around Canvey to commemorate Brilleaux&#x27;s life, as well as additional walking tours during which he points out landmarks from the band&#x27;s career. These include the jetty featured in the photograph on the band&#x27;s first album cover, and venues where they played early in their career, such as The Lobster Smack inn, The Monico Nightclub and The Canvey Club (disguised as &#x27;The Alibi Club&#x27; on the sleeve of the album &quot;Sneakin&#x27; Suspicion&quot;).

A film by Julien Temple about the early days of the band, &quot;Oil City Confidential&quot;, premiered at the London Film Festival on 22 October 2009, and received a standing ovation. Guest of honour was Lee Brilleaux&#x27;s mother Joan Collinson, along with his widow Shirley and children Kelly and Nick. All the surviving members of the original band were present along with manager Chris Fenwick, former tour manager and Stiff Records boss Jake Riviera and other friends and colleagues of the band. The film has its own Facebook page.
Reviewing the film for &quot;The Independent&quot;, Nick Hasted concluded: &quot;Feelgood are remembered in rock history, if at all, as John the Baptists to punk&#x27;s messiahs&quot;. On general release from 1 February 2010, the film was critically well received, with Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; describing it as &quot;...a vivid study of period, music and place&quot;. The film was first broadcast on BBC Four in April 2010.

A major exhibition of memorabilia celebrating the band&#x27;s career ran at The Canvey Club between May and July 2013, having been extended several times.

On 16 June 2021, it was announced that Walwyn was &quot;unavailable to play live shows for the foreseeable future&quot;, due to family holiday commitments and the fact that his son has a possible compromised immune system. Later concerts were played by former guitarist Gordon Russell, whom Walwyn had replaced 32 years before.

In April 2024 the band&#x27;s van was stolen, leaving them without any instruments and equipment, a week before a forthcoming tour of Germany. The theft took place outside the home of bassist Phil Mitchell in Hockley, Essex, between the night of 15 April and the morning of 16 April.

<doc id="45619" wikidata="Q2719731" url="?curid=45619" title="Lagged Fibonacci generator">
<text>A Lagged Fibonacci generator (LFG or sometimes LFib) is an example of a pseudorandom number generator. This class of random number generator is aimed at being an improvement on the &#x27;standard&#x27; linear congruential generator. These are based on a generalisation of the Fibonacci sequence.

The Fibonacci sequence may be described by the recurrence relation:

:formula_1

Hence, the new term is the sum of the last two terms in the sequence. This can be generalised to the sequence:

:formula_2

In which case, the new term is some combination of any two previous terms. &quot;m&quot; is usually a power of 2 (&quot;m&quot; = 2&quot;M&quot;), often 232 or 264. The formula_3 operator denotes a general binary operation. This may be either addition, subtraction, multiplication, or the bitwise exclusive-or operator (XOR). The theory of this type of generator is rather complex, and it may not be sufficient simply to choose random values for and . These generators also tend to be very sensitive to initialisation.

Generators of this type employ &quot;k&quot; words of state (they &#x27;remember&#x27; the last &quot;k&quot; values).

If the operation used is addition, then the generator is described as an &quot;Additive Lagged Fibonacci Generator&quot; or ALFG, if multiplication is used, it is a &quot;Multiplicative Lagged Fibonacci Generator&quot; or MLFG, and if the XOR operation is used, it is called a &quot;Two-tap generalised feedback shift register&quot; or GFSR. The Mersenne Twister algorithm is a variation on a GFSR. The GFSR is also related to the linear-feedback shift register, or LFSR.

== Properties of lagged Fibonacci generators ==
The maximum period of lagged Fibonacci generators depends on the binary operation formula_3. If addition or subtraction is used, the maximum period is (2&quot;k&quot; − 1) × 2&quot;M&quot;−1. If multiplication is used, the maximum period is (2&quot;k&quot; − 1) × 2&quot;M&quot;−3, or 1/4 of period of the additive case. If bitwise xor is used, the maximum period is 2&quot;k&quot; − 1.

For the generator to achieve this maximum period, the polynomial:

:&quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot; + &quot;x&quot;&quot;j&quot; + 1

must be primitive over the integers mod 2. Values of &quot;j&quot; and &quot;k&quot; satisfying this constraint have been published in the literature. 
Another list of possible values for &quot;j&quot; and &quot;k&quot; is on page 29 of volume 2 of &quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot;:

:(24, 55), (38, 89), (37, 100), (30, 127), (83, 258), (107, 378), (273, 607), (1029, 2281), (576, 3217), (4187, 9689), (7083, 19937), (9739, 23209)

Note that the smaller number have short periods (only a few &quot;random&quot; numbers are generated before the first &quot;random&quot; number is repeated and the sequence restarts).

If addition is used, it is required that at least one of the first &quot;k&quot; values chosen to initialise the generator be odd. If multiplication is used, instead, it is required that all the first &quot;k&quot; values be odd, and further that at least one of them is ±3 mod 8.

It has been suggested that good ratios between and are approximately the golden ratio.

== Problems with LFGs ==
In a paper on four-tap shift registers, Robert M. Ziff, referring to LFGs that use the XOR operator, states that &quot;It is now widely known that such generators, in particular with the two-tap rules such as R(103, 250), have serious deficiencies. Marsaglia observed very poor behavior with R(24, 55) and smaller generators, and advised against using generators of this type altogether. ... The basic problem of two-tap generators R(a, b) is that they have a built-in three-point correlation between formula_5, formula_6, and formula_7, simply given by the generator itself ... While these correlations are spread over the size formula_8 of the generator itself, they can evidently still lead to significant errors.&quot;. This only refers to the standard LFG where each new number in the sequence depends on two previous numbers. A three-tap LFG has been shown to eliminate some statistical problems such as failing the Birthday Spacings and Generalized Triple tests.

==Example implementation==
A simple implementation in the C programming language may look as shown below. This implementation uses 64-bit words and has a period of (2607 -1) × 263

#define R (607)
#define S (273)

#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;

uint64_t X[R];

uint64_t gen_rand()
 static int j = S - 1, k = R - 1;
 uint64_t r;
 r = X[k] = X[k] + X[j--];
 k--;
 if (j &lt; 0)
 j = R - 1;
 else if (k &lt; 0)
 k = R - 1;
 return r;

<text>Psychopharmacology (from Greek ; ; and ) is the scientific study of the effects drugs have on mood, sensation, thinking, behavior, judgment and evaluation, and memory. It is distinguished from neuropsychopharmacology, which emphasizes the correlation between drug-induced changes in the functioning of cells in the nervous system and changes in consciousness and behavior.

The field of psychopharmacology studies a wide range of substances with various types of psychoactive properties, focusing primarily on the chemical interactions with the brain. The term &quot;psychopharmacology&quot; was likely first coined by David Macht in 1920. Psychoactive drugs interact with particular target sites or receptors found in the nervous system to induce widespread changes in physiological or psychological functions. The specific interaction between drugs and their receptors is referred to as &quot;drug action&quot;, and the widespread changes in physiological or psychological function is referred to as &quot;drug effect&quot;. These drugs may originate from natural sources such as plants and animals, or from artificial sources such as chemical synthesis in the laboratory.

==Historical overview==
===Early psychopharmacology===

Not often mentioned or included in the field of psychopharmacology today are psychoactive substances not identified as useful in modern mental health settings or references. These substances are naturally occurring, but nonetheless psychoactive, and are compounds identified through the work of ethnobotanists and ethnomycologists (and others who study the native use of naturally occurring psychoactive drugs). However, although these substances have been used throughout history by various cultures, and have a profound effect on mentality and brain function, they have not always attained the degree of scrutinous evaluation that lab-made compounds have. Nevertheless, some, such as psilocybin and mescaline, have provided a basis of study for the compounds that are used and examined in the field today. Hunter-gatherer societies tended to favor hallucinogens, and today their use can still be observed in many surviving tribal cultures. The exact drug used depends on what the particular ecosystem a given tribe lives in can support, and are typically found growing wild. Such drugs include various psychoactive mushrooms containing psilocybin or muscimol and cacti containing mescaline and other chemicals, along with myriad other plants containing psychoactive chemicals. These societies generally attach spiritual significance to such drug use, and often incorporate it into their religious practices.
With the dawn of the Neolithic and the proliferation of agriculture, new psychoactives came into use as a natural by-product of farming. Among them were opium, cannabis, and alcohol derived from the fermentation of cereals and fruits. Most societies began developing herblores, lists of herbs which were good for treating various physical and mental ailments. For example, St. John&#x27;s wort was traditionally prescribed in parts of Europe for depression (in addition to use as a general-purpose tea), and Chinese medicine developed elaborate lists of herbs and preparations. These and various other substances that have an effect on the brain are still used as remedies in many cultures.
===Modern psychopharmacology===
The dawn of contemporary psychopharmacology marked the beginning of the use of psychiatric drugs to treat psychological illnesses. It brought with it the use of opiates and barbiturates for the management of acute behavioral issues in patients. In the early stages, psychopharmacology was primarily used for sedation. With the 1950s came the establishment of lithium for mania, chlorpromazine for psychoses, and then in rapid succession, the development of tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and benzodiazepines, among other antipsychotics and antidepressants. A defining feature of this era includes an evolution of research methods, with the establishment of placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, and the development of methods for analyzing blood levels with respect to clinical outcome and increased sophistication in clinical trials. The early 1960s revealed a revolutionary model by Julius Axelrod describing nerve signals and synaptic transmission, which was followed by a drastic increase of biochemical brain research into the effects of psychotropic agents on brain chemistry. After the 1960s, the field of psychiatry shifted to incorporate the indications for and efficacy of pharmacological treatments, and began to focus on the use and toxicities of these medications. The 1970s and 1980s were further marked by a better understanding of the synaptic aspects of the action mechanisms of drugs. However, the model has its critics, too – notably Joanna Moncrieff and the Critical Psychiatry Network.

==Chemical signaling==

===Neurotransmitters===
Psychoactive drugs exert their sensory and behavioral effects almost entirely by acting on neurotransmitters and by modifying one or more aspects of synaptic transmission. Neurotransmitters can be viewed as chemicals through which neurons primarily communicate; psychoactive drugs affect the mind by altering this communication. Drugs may act by 1) serving as a precursor to a neurotransmitter; 2) inhibiting neurotransmitter synthesis; 3) preventing storage of neurotransmitters in the presynaptic vesicle; 4) stimulating or inhibiting neurotransmitter release; 5) stimulating or blocking post-synaptic receptors; 6) stimulating autoreceptors, inhibiting neurotransmitter release; 7) blocking autoreceptors, increasing neurotransmitter release; 8) inhibiting neurotransmission breakdown; or 9) blocking neurotransmitter reuptake by the presynaptic neuron.

===Hormones===
The other central method through which drugs act is by affecting communications between cells through hormones. Neurotransmitters can usually only travel a microscopic distance before reaching their target at the other side of the synaptic cleft, while hormones can travel long distances before reaching target cells anywhere in the body. Thus, the endocrine system is a critical focus of psychopharmacology because 1) drugs can alter the secretion of many hormones; 2) hormones may alter the behavioral responses to drugs; 3) hormones themselves sometimes have psychoactive properties; and 4) the secretion of some hormones, especially those dependent on the pituitary gland, is controlled by neurotransmitter systems in the brain.

==Psychopharmacological substances==
===Alcohol===
Alcohol is a depressant, the effects of which may vary according to dosage amount, frequency, and chronicity. As a member of the sedative-hypnotic class, at the lowest doses, the individual feels relaxed and less anxious. In quiet settings, the user may feel drowsy, but in settings with increased sensory stimulation, individuals may feel uninhibited and more confident. High doses of alcohol rapidly consumed may produce amnesia for the events that occur during intoxication. Other effects include reduced coordination, which leads to slurred speech, impaired fine-motor skills, and delayed reaction time. The effects of alcohol on the body&#x27;s neurochemistry are more difficult to examine than some other drugs. This is because the chemical nature of the substance makes it easy to penetrate into the brain, and it also influences the phospholipid bilayer of neurons. This allows alcohol to have a widespread impact on many normal cell functions and modifies the actions of several neurotransmitter systems. Alcohol inhibits glutamate (a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the nervous system) neurotransmission by reducing the effectiveness at the NMDA receptor, which is related to memory loss associated with intoxication. It also modulates the function of GABA, a major inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitter. Abuse of alcohol has also been correlated with thiamine deficiencies within the brain, leading to lasting neurological conditions that affect primarily the ability of the brain to effectively store memories. One such neurological condition is called Korsakoff&#x27;s syndrome, for which very few effective treatment modalities have been found. The reinforcing qualities of alcohol leading to repeated use – and thus also the mechanisms of withdrawal from chronic alcohol use – are partially due to the substance&#x27;s action on the dopamine system. This is also due to alcohol&#x27;s effect on the opioid systems, or endorphins, that have opiate-like effects, such as modulating pain, mood, feeding, reinforcement, and response to stress.

===Antidepressants===
Antidepressants reduce symptoms of mood disorders primarily through the regulation of norepinephrine and serotonin (particularly the 5-HT receptors). After chronic use, neurons adapt to the change in biochemistry, resulting in a change in pre- and postsynaptic receptor density and second messenger function. The Monoamine Theory of Depression and Anxiety, which states that the disruption of the activity of nitrogen containing neurotransmitters (i.e. serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine) is strongly correlated with the presence of depressive symptoms. Despite its longstanding prominence in pharmaceutical advertising, the myth that low serotonin levels cause depression is not supported by scientific evidence.

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are the oldest class of antidepressants. They inhibit monoamine oxidase, the enzyme that metabolizes the monoamine neurotransmitters in the presynaptic terminals that are not contained in protective synaptic vesicles. The inhibition of the enzyme increases the amount of neurotransmitter available for release. It increases norepinephrine, dopamine, and 5-HT, thus increasing the action of the transmitters at their receptors. MAOIs have been somewhat disfavored because of their reputation for more serious side effects.

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) work through binding to the presynaptic transporter proteins and blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine or 5-HT into the presynaptic terminal, prolonging the duration of transmitter action at the synapse.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) selectively block the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT) through their inhibiting effects on the sodium/potassium ATP-dependent serotonin transporter in presynaptic neurons. This increases the availability of 5-HT in the synaptic cleft. The main parameters to consider in choosing an antidepressant are side effects and safety. Most SSRIs are available generically and are relatively inexpensive. Older antidepressants such as TCAs and MAOIs usually require more visits and monitoring, which may offset the low expense of the drugs. SSRIs are relatively safe in overdoses and better tolerated than TCAs and MAOIs for most patients.

===Antipsychotics===
All proven antipsychotics are postsynaptic dopamine receptor blockers (dopamine antagonists). For an antipsychotic to be effective, it generally requires a dopamine antagonism of 60%–80% of dopamine D2 receptors.

First generation (typical) antipsychotics: Traditional neuroleptics modify several neurotransmitter systems, but their clinical effectiveness is most likely due to their ability to antagonize dopamine transmission by competitively blocking the receptors or by inhibiting dopamine release. The most serious and troublesome side effects of these classical antipsychotics are movement disorders that resemble the symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, because the neuroleptics antagonize dopamine receptors broadly, also reducing the normal dopamine-mediated inhibition of cholinergic cells in the striatum.

Second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics: The concept of &quot;atypicality&quot; is from the finding that second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have a greater serotonin/dopamine ratio than earlier drugs, and might be associated with improved efficacy (particularly for the negative symptoms of psychosis) and reduced extrapyramidal side effects. Some of the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics may be due to 5-HT2 antagonism or the blockade of other dopamine receptors. Agents that purely block 5-HT2 or dopamine receptors other than D2 have often failed as effective antipsychotics.

===Benzodiazepines===
Benzodiazepines are often used to reduce anxiety symptoms, muscle tension, seizure disorders, insomnia, symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, and panic attack symptoms. Their action is primarily on specific benzodiazepine sites on the GABAA receptor. This receptor complex is thought to mediate the anxiolytic, sedative, and anticonvulsant actions of the benzodiazepines. Use of benzodiazepines carries the risk of tolerance (necessitating increased dosage), dependence, and abuse. Taking these drugs for a long period of time can lead to severe withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation.

===Hallucinogens===

==== Classical serotonergic psychedelics ====
Psychedelics cause perceptual and cognitive distortions without delirium. The state of intoxication is often called a &quot;trip&quot;. Onset is the first stage after an individual ingests (LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca, and mescaline) or smokes (dimethyltryptamine) the substance. This stage may consist of visual effects, with an intensification of colors and the appearance of geometric patterns that can be seen with one&#x27;s eyes closed. This is followed by a plateau phase, where the subjective sense of time begins to slow and the visual effects increase in intensity. The user may experience synesthesia, a crossing-over of sensations (for example, one may &quot;see&quot; sounds and &quot;hear&quot; colors). These outward sensory effects have been referred to as the &quot;mystical experience&quot;, and current research suggests that this state could be beneficial to the treatment of some mental illnesses, such as depression and possibly addiction. In instances where some patients have seen a lack of improvement from the use of antidepressants, serotonergic hallucinogens have been observed to be rather effective in treatment. In addition to the sensory-perceptual effects, hallucinogenic substances may induce feelings of depersonalization, emotional shifts to a euphoric or anxious/fearful state, and a disruption of logical thought. Hallucinogens are classified chemically as either indolamines (specifically tryptamines), sharing a common structure with serotonin, or as phenethylamines, which share a common structure with norepinephrine. Both classes of these drugs are agonists at the 5-HT2 receptors; this is thought to be the central component of their hallucinogenic properties. Activation of 5-HT2A may be particularly important for hallucinogenic activity. However, repeated exposure to hallucinogens leads to rapid tolerance, likely through down-regulation of these receptors in specific target cells. Research suggests that hallucinogens affect many of these receptor sites around the brain and that through these interactions, hallucinogenic substances may be capable of inducing positive introspective experiences. The current research implies that many of the effects that can be observed occur in the occipital lobe and the frontomedial cortex; however, they also present many secondary global effects in the brain that have not yet been connected to the substance&#x27;s biochemical mechanism of action.

==== Dissociative hallucinogens ====
Another class of hallucinogens, known as dissociatives, includes drugs such as ketamine, phencyclidine (PCP), and &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot;. Drugs such as these are thought to interact predominantly with glutamate receptors within the brain. Specifically, ketamine is thought to block NMDA receptors that are responsible for signalling in the glutamate pathways. Ketamine&#x27;s more tranquilizing effects can be seen in the central nervous system through interactions with parts of the thalamus by inhibition of certain functions. Ketamine has become a major drug of research for the treatment of depression. These antidepressant effects are thought to be related to the drug&#x27;s action on the glutamate receptor system and the relative spike in glutamate levels, as well as its interaction with mTOR, which is an enzymatic protein involved in catabolic processes in the human body. Phencyclidine&#x27;s biochemical properties are still mostly unknown; however, its use has been associated with dissociation, hallucinations, and in some cases seizures and death. &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot;, a plant native to Mexico, has strong dissociative and hallucinogenic properties when the dry leaves are smoked or chewed. The qualitative value of these effects, whether negative or positive, has been observed to vary between individuals with many other factors to consider.

===Hypnotics===
Hypnotics are often used to treat the symptoms of insomnia or other sleep disorders. Benzodiazepines are still among the most widely prescribed sedative-hypnotics in the United States today. Certain non-benzodiazepine drugs are used as hypnotics as well. Although they lack the chemical structure of the benzodiazepines, their sedative effect is similarly through action on the GABAA receptor. They also have a reputation of being less addictive than benzodiazepines. Melatonin, a naturally-occurring hormone, is often used over the counter (OTC) to treat insomnia and jet lag. This hormone appears to be excreted by the pineal gland early during the sleep cycle and may contribute to human circadian rhythms. Because OTC melatonin supplements are not subject to careful and consistent manufacturing, more specific melatonin agonists are sometimes preferred. They are used for their action on melatonin receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, responsible for sleep-wake cycles. Many barbiturates have or had an FDA-approved indication for use as sedative-hypnotics, but have become less widely used because of their limited safety margin in overdose, their potential for dependence, and the degree of central nervous system depression they induce. The amino-acid L-tryptophan is also available OTC, and seems to be free of dependence or abuse liability. However, it is not as powerful as the traditional hypnotics. Because of the possible role of serotonin in sleep patterns, a new generation of 5-HT2 antagonists are in current development as hypnotics.

===Cannabis and the cannabinoids===
Cannabis consumption produces a dose-dependent state of intoxication in humans. There is commonly increased blood flow to the skin, which leads to an increased heart rate and sensations of warmth or flushing. It also frequently induces increased hunger. Iversen (2000) categorized the subjective and behavioral effects often associated with cannabis into three stages. The first is the &quot;buzz&quot;, a brief period of initial responding where the main effects are lightheadedness or slight dizziness, in addition to possible tingling sensations in the extremities or other parts of the body. The &quot;high&quot; is characterized by feelings of euphoria and exhilaration characterized by mild psychedelia as well as a sense of disinhibition. If the individual has taken a sufficiently large dose of cannabis, the level of intoxication progresses to the stage of being &quot;stoned&quot;, and the user may feel calm, relaxed, and possibly in a dreamlike state. Sensory reactions may include the feeling of floating, enhanced visual and auditory perception, visual illusions, or the perception of the slowing of time passage, which are somewhat psychedelic in nature.

There exist two primary CNS cannabinoid receptors, on which marijuana and the cannabinoids act. Both the CB1 and CB2 receptor are found in the brain. The CB2 receptor is also found in the immune system. CB1 is expressed at high densities in the basal ganglia, cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex. Receptor activation can inhibit cAMP formation, inhibit voltage-sensitive calcium ion channels, and activate potassium ion channels. Many CB1 receptors are located on axon terminals, where they act to inhibit the release of various neurotransmitters. In combination, these chemical actions work to alter various functions of the central nervous system, including the motor system, memory, and various cognitive processes.

===Opioids===
The opioid category of drugs – including drugs such as heroin, morphine, and oxycodone – belong to the class of narcotic analgesics, which reduce pain without producing unconsciousness but do produce a sense of relaxation and sleep, and at high doses may result in coma and death. The ability of opioids (both endogenous and exogenous) to relieve pain depends on a complex set of neuronal pathways at the spinal cord level, as well as various locations above the spinal cord. Small endorphin neurons in the spinal cord act on receptors to decrease the conduction of pain signals from the spinal cord to higher brain centers. Descending neurons originating in the periaqueductal gray give rise to two pathways that further block pain signals in the spinal cord. The pathways begin in the locus coeruleus (noradrenaline) and the nucleus of raphe (serotonin). Similar to other abused substances, opioid drugs increase dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Opioids are more likely to produce physical dependence worse than that of other classes of psychoactive drugs, and can lead to painful withdrawal symptoms if discontinued abruptly after regular use.

===Stimulants===
Cocaine is one of the more common stimulants and is a complex drug that interacts with various neurotransmitter systems. It commonly causes heightened alertness, increased confidence, feelings of exhilaration, reduced fatigue, and a generalized sense of well-being. The effects of cocaine are similar to those of amphetamines, though cocaine tends to have a shorter duration of effect. In high doses or with prolonged use, cocaine can result in a number of negative effects, including irritability, anxiety, exhaustion, total insomnia, and even psychotic symptomatology. Most of the behavioral and physiological actions of cocaine can be explained by its ability to block the reuptake of the two catecholamines, dopamine and norepinephrine, as well as serotonin. Cocaine binds to transporters that normally clear these transmitters from the synaptic cleft, inhibiting their function. This leads to increased levels of neurotransmitter in the cleft and transmission at the synapses. Based on in-vitro studies using rat brain tissue, cocaine binds most strongly to the serotonin transporter, followed by the dopamine transporter, and then the norepinephrine transporter.

Amphetamines tend to cause the same behavioral and subjective effects of cocaine. Various forms of amphetamine are commonly used to treat the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy, or are used recreationally. Amphetamine and methamphetamine are indirect agonists of the catecholaminergic systems. They block catecholamine reuptake, in addition to releasing catecholamines from nerve terminals. There is evidence that dopamine receptors play a central role in the behavioral responses of animals to cocaine, amphetamines, and other psychostimulant drugs. One action causes the dopamine molecules to be released from inside the vesicles into the cytoplasm of the nerve terminal, which are then transported outside by the mesolimbic dopamine pathway to the nucleus accumbens. This plays a key role in the rewarding and reinforcing effects of cocaine and amphetamine in animals, and is the primary mechanism for amphetamine dependence.

==Psychopharmacological research==

In psychopharmacology, researchers are interested in any substance that crosses the blood–brain barrier and thus has an effect on behavior, mood, or cognition. Drugs are researched for their physiochemical properties, physical side effects, and psychological side effects. Researchers in psychopharmacology study a variety of different psychoactive substances, including alcohol, cannabinoids, club drugs, psychedelics, opiates, nicotine, caffeine, psychomotor stimulants, inhalants, and anabolic–androgenic steroids. They also study drugs used in the treatment of affective and anxiety disorders, as well as schizophrenia.

Clinical studies are often very specific, typically beginning with animal testing and ending with human testing. In the human testing phase, there is often a group of subjects: one group is given a placebo, and the other is administered a carefully measured therapeutic dose of the drug in question. After all of the testing is completed, the drug is proposed to the concerned regulatory authority (e.g. the U.S. FDA), and is either commercially introduced to the public via prescription, or deemed safe enough for over-the-counter sale.

Though particular drugs are prescribed for specific symptoms or syndromes, they are usually not specific to the treatment of any single mental disorder.

A somewhat controversial application of psychopharmacology is &quot;cosmetic psychiatry&quot;: persons who do not meet criteria for any psychiatric disorder are nevertheless prescribed psychotropic medication. The antidepressant bupropion is then prescribed to increase perceived energy levels and assertiveness while diminishing the need for sleep. The antihypertensive compound propranolol is sometimes chosen to eliminate the discomfort of day-to-day anxiety. Fluoxetine in nondepressed people can produce a feeling of generalized well-being. Pramipexole, a treatment for restless leg syndrome, can dramatically increase libido in women. These and other off-label lifestyle applications of medications are not uncommon. Although occasionally reported in the medical literature, no guidelines for such usage have been developed. There is also a potential for the misuse of prescription psychoactive drugs by elderly persons, who may have multiple drug prescriptions.

<text>The Iranian Green Movement () or Green Wave of Iran (), also referred to as the Persian Awakening or Persian Spring by the western media, refers to a political movement that arose after the June 12, 2009 Iranian presidential election and lasted until early 2010, in which protesters demanded the removal of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad from office. Green was initially used as the symbol of Mir Hossein Mousavi&#x27;s campaign, but after the election it became the symbol of unity and hope for those asking for annulment of what they regarded as a fraudulent election. Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi are recognized as political leaders of the Green Movement. Grand Ayatollah Hossein-Ali Montazeri was also mentioned as spiritual leader of the movement.

The Green Movement protests were a major event in Iran&#x27;s modern political history and observers claimed that these protests were the largest since the Iranian Revolution of 1978–79. While the protests started out as a peaceful, non-violent movement, hundreds of people were arrested and several died as protests turned more violent in the following months. The movement eventually had trouble with retaining its momentum.

==Outcome of 2009–2010 Iranian election protests==

Background to the protests

The office of the President in Iran is considered the second most powerful position in the country, after that of the Supreme Leader, as the President is the head of the executive branch of power. Since 2005, Iran was led by conservative Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who first served as mayor of Tehran before being elected as president. Ahmadinejad&#x27;s name was associated with human rights violations in the country, particularly with the use of violence. The list of these violations included the increased number of death penalties and problems with LGBT rights. According to Human Rights Watch, &quot;basic human rights protection in Iran has deteriorated to new lows&quot; under Ahmadinejad&#x27;s first presidency as, for example, the number of executions increased by three times. The Iranian president has no power over the judiciary, as it is headed by the chief justice who is in turn appointed by the Supreme Leader.

During the first presidency of Ahmadinejad, the problem was particularly severe with juvenile death penalty. More than 130 juvenile offenders were sentenced to death in Iran as of 2008. Moreover, independent researchers pointed out that the number of political prisoners increased during Ahmadinejad&#x27;s first presidency. Other problems with human rights involved the absence of basic protection of LGBT rights. The number of criminal convictions for homosexual sex increased between 2005 and 2009, while the President even denied the existence of gay people in Iran.

Issues with human rights and other problems, such as the alleged voting fraud, led Ahmadinejad&#x27;s popularity to decline. This was especially the case in urban areas, including the country&#x27;s capital Tehran, and among the youth, according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

In 2009, the Iranian government held a regular presidential election. Former Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi was the most popular candidate opposing Ahmadinejad.

The election took place on 12 June 2009 but the disagreement between the government and the opposition over the results of the election quickly caused a significant controversy. Ahmadinejad was considered to be winning in a landslide victory, but Mousavi and his supporters believed the results were fraudulent. They suggested that the Interior Minister Sadegh Mahsouli, an ally of Ahmadinejad, had interfered with the election and distorted the votes to keep Ahmadinejad in power.

Mousavi claimed the victory and called for his supporters to celebrate it. At the same time, the office of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad almost immediately announced that the sitting president had won the election as he had received approximately two-thirds of votes. It sparked the 2009–2010 Iranian election protests, which were organized mostly by Mousavi&#x27;s supporters and were directed against Ahmadinejad and the government in general.

===Protests===

Clashes broke out between police and groups protesting the election results from early morning on Saturday onward. At the beginning, the protests were considered peaceful. However, as time passed, they became increasingly violent. In a stand-off that later took place in north Tehran between supporters of Ahmadinejad and Mousavi, an angry crowd of citizens broke into shops, started fires, and tore down signs. Civil unrest took place as riot police on motorbikes used batons to disperse Mousavi supporters who staged a sit-in near the interior ministry, where the results were announced. Up to 2,000 Mousavi supporters erected barricades of burning tyres and chanted &quot;Mousavi take back our vote!&quot;.

The demonstrations grew bigger and more heated than the 1999 student protests. Al Jazeera English described the 13 June situation as the &quot;biggest unrest since the 1979 revolution.&quot; It also reported that protests seemed spontaneous without any formal organization. Two hundred people protested outside Iran&#x27;s embassy in London on 13 June. Ynet has stated that &quot;tens of thousands&quot; protested on 13 June. Demonstrators are chanting phrases such as &quot;Down with the dictator&quot;, &quot;Death to the dictator&quot;, and &quot;Give us our votes back&quot;. Mousavi urged for calm and asked that his supporters refrain from acts of violence.

Ynet reported on 14 June that two people had died in the rioting so far. That day, protests had been organized in front of the Iranian embassies in Turkey, Dubai, Paris, Berlin, London, Rome, Sydney, Vienna and The Hague. In response to the reformist protests, tens of thousands of people rallied in Tehran on 14 June to support the victory of Ahmadinejad.

On 15 June, Mousavi rallied, with a number of his supporters ranging anywhere from hundreds of thousands to three million, in Tehran, despite being warned by state officials that any such rally would be illegal. The demonstration, the largest in the Islamic Republic of Iran&#x27;s 30-year history, was Mousavi&#x27;s first public appearance after the election. Protests focused around Azadi Tower, around which lines of people stretched for more than nine kilometers. Gunshots were reported to have been fired at the rally, where Mousavi had spoken to his supporters saying, &quot;The vote of the people is more important than Mousavi or any other person.&quot; All three opposition candidates made an appearance.

Competing rallies for Mousavi and for Ahmadinejad took place on 16 June. The pro-Ahmadinejad protesters, chanting the phrases &quot;Death to America!&quot; and &quot;Death to Israel!&quot;, outnumbered their opponents, but they did not match the numbers of opponents who had protested the day before. Reports from the state media and elsewhere stated on 16 June that seven people have died in all of the protests so far. However, Times Online quoted a Rasoul Akram Hospital nurse that day who asserted that 28 people have suffered from &quot;bullet wounds&quot; and eight have died so far. Over half a million reformist Iranians marched silently from Haft-e-Tir Square to Vali Asr Square on 17 June. Huffington Post reported that day that 32 people had died protesting so far.

On 14 February 2011, the largest Green demonstrations in Iran in more than a year broke out. In response, pro-government MPs called for the death of opposition leaders Mir Hussein Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi.

===Government actions===

====Arrests====

On the weekend of 13 and 14 June, in a series of raids across Tehran, the government arrested over 170 people, according to police officials. Among them were prominent reformist politicians, including Mojahedin of the Islamic Revolution Organization (MIRO) founder Behzad Nabavi, Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF) leader Mohsen Mirdamadi, and former president Mohammad Khatami&#x27;s brother Mohammad-Reza Khatami, who was later released. Also arrested were Mostafa Tajzadeh and Mohsen Aminzadeh, whom the IRNA said were involved in orchestrating protests on 13 June. Anonymous sources said that the police stormed the headquarters of the IIPF and arrested a number of people. Iranian journalist Mashallah Shamsolvaezin claimed that presidential candidate Mir-Hossein Mousavi was put under house arrest, although officials denied this. An estimated 200 people were detained after clashes with students at Tehran University, although many were later released.

Acting Police Chief Ahmad-Reza Radan stated via the state press service on the 14th that &quot;in the interrogation of related rebels, we will try to find the link between the plotters and foreign media&quot;. A judiciary spokesman said they had not been arrested but that they were summoned, &quot;warned not to increase tension,&quot; and later released. Intelligence minister Gholam Hossein Mohseni-Ejehei linked some arrests to terrorism supported from outside Iran, stating that &quot;more than 20 explosive consignments were discovered&quot;. Others, he said, were &quot;counter-revolutionary groups&quot; who had &quot;penetrated election headquarters&quot; of the election candidates.

On 16 June, Reuters reported that former vice-president Mohammad-Ali Abtahi and former presidential advisor Saeed Hajjarian had been arrested. Human rights lawyer Abdolfattah Soltani, who had been demanding a recount of all votes, was also arrested on the Tuesday according to Shirin Ebadi, who said that security officials had posed as clients. Over 100 students were arrested after security forces fired tear gas at protesters at Shiraz University on the same day. Reporters Without Borders reported that 5 of 11 arrested journalists were still detention as of 16 June, and that a further 10 journalists were unaccounted for and may have been arrested.

On 17 June, former foreign minister and secretary-general of the Freedom Movement of Iran, Ebrahim Yazdi, was arrested while undergoing tests at Pars hospital in Tehran. He was held overnight in Evin Prison before being released and returning to hospital, where according to Human Rights Watch he remained under guard. In Tabriz, other Freedom Movement activists and eight members of the IIPF were arrested, with reports of at least 100 civic figures&#x27; arrests. The total number of arrests across Iran since the election was reported as 500.

Aaron Rhodes, a spokesman for the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, stated that &quot;Iranian intelligence and security forces are using the public protests to engage in what appears to be a major purge of reform-oriented individuals whose situations in detention could be life-threatening&quot;. In Isfahan Province, prosecutor-general Mohammadreza Habibi warned that dissidents could face execution under Islamic law.

In 2011, Mir Hossein Mousavi and his wife and Mehdi Karroubi were placed under house arrest by the government. During his election campaigns in 2013 and 2017, then-presidential candidate Hassan Rouhani pledged to release them if he were to be elected as president, but the opposition leaders remain under house arrest to this day.

==Where is my vote?==
&quot;Where is my vote?&quot; ( &quot;ra&#x27;y-e-man kojāst?&quot;) is a motto which was used during the protests. The Iranian government, headed by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, released results claiming a two-thirds majority. However, Mousavi had already claimed victory before the vote count was done and supporters of Mousavi and Karroubi accused the government of rigging the votes.

In the aftermath of the election, protests increased and several massive protests were held around the country by the people. The government arrested a large number of the protesters and several were killed by the police and governmental militia forces.

Even though the Iranian government didn’t allow any form of gathering by opposition-supporters in Tehran and across the country, significantly slowed down internet access and censored any form of media agreeing with the opposition, hundreds of thousands of Iranians chanted this motto, defying the law and challenging the Islamic Republic.

== Development of the Green Movement ==
The Green Movement spread throughout the nation as a non-violent protest movement, bringing about hope of more democratization. Protests lasted all through the fall of 2009, with big events happening on national holidays. On Quds Day (September 18), the anniversary of the US Embassy takeover (November 4), National Students Day (December 7th) and the day of Grand Ayatollah Montazeri&#x27;s death (December 19) there were turnouts of thousands of people. On the holy day of Ashura (December 7), the protests turned more violent as hundreds of thousands took to the streets once again, the highest turnout since June, and clashed with state security forces. Hundreds of people were arrested and at least 15 people died. Among them was the 35 year-old nephew of Mir-Hossein Mousavi, Seyed Ali Mousavi.

Within a year, the Green Movement had trouble with retaining its relevance. The number of public demonstrations started to decrease because of the harsh reactions by the state. Security forces attacked protesters in the streets and imprisoned activists as well as politicians. Mousavi and Karroubi were placed under house arrest in 2010, which created even more difficulties for the Green Movement to stay organized.

Access to the Internet and social media as well as the possibility to send text messages was regularly restricted by the government, making it difficult for further protests to materialize. The movement later became less confrontational in an effort to influence the next presidential elections and several groups linked to the Green Movement supported the campaign of Hassan Rouhani in 2014. Following his victory, slogans and symbols that emerged during the protests in 2009 were used again by his supporters.

==The Green Path of Hope==
Mousavi and other reformist leaders are now working in peaceful and legal methods to widen the influence of their reforms. They have set up a new coalition named &quot;The Green Path of Hope&quot;. Iranian political parties and movements need to be authorized by the Interior Ministry. Mousavi neither recognizes the current government as legitimate nor is likely to receive permission; so, the movement was named a &quot;path&quot; in order to bypass this law.

The Green Path of Hope claims it seeks to continue protests against Ahmadinejad&#x27;s presidency following lawful and peaceful methods, and the full execution of the constitution, as Mousavi says:&quot;You can&#x27;t follow some parts of the constitution and throw the rest into a bin.&quot; According to organization officials, the movement encompasses numerous political parties, NGO&#x27;s and social networks. The &quot;Green Path&quot; has six main members of the central council, who are connected to reformist parties, NGOs, and social networks. The main body consists of ordinary protesters. The strategy is to connect existent pressures and issues in society in a social network, and to therefore lead protests in a lawful manner. The goals of the organization are stated as follows:&quot;During the election, our mottos supported and remained in the framework of the constitution; today we are devoted to those slogans. We believe that if the people&#x27;s demands were treated fairly, instead of being distorted by the media and linked to foreigners, and the government promoted truth by fair criticism, our mottos could satisfy the public.&quot;

==Iran national football team==
During Iran&#x27;s final game of the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against South Korea in Seoul on 17 June 2009, seven members of the team, Javad Nekounam, Ali Karimi, Hossein Kaebi, Masoud Shojaei, Mohammad Nosrati, Vahid Hashemian, and captain Mehdi Mahdavikia allegedly wore green wristbands in support of the Iranian Green Movement during the 2009 Iranian election protests. However green was one of the colors of their uniform, which also had green shirt logos. Initially it was reported that all seven players were banned for life by the Iranian Football Federation, but state-run media claimed that all seven had &quot;retired&quot;. On 24 June 2009, FIFA wrote to Iran&#x27;s Football Federation asking for clarification on the situation. The Iranian Football Federation replied that no disciplinary action has been taken against any player. As of 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, several of the above-mentioned players have played again for the national team, notably Javad Nekounam, Masoud Shojaei, and Mehdi Mahdavikia.

<doc id="45631" wikidata="Q1739745" url="?curid=45631" title="Telephony Application Programming Interface">
<text>The Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) is a Microsoft Windows API, which provides computer telephony integration and enables PCs running Microsoft Windows to use telephone services. Different versions of TAPI are available on different versions of Windows. TAPI allows applications to control telephony functions between a computer and telephone network for data, fax, and voice calls. It includes basic functions, such as dialing, answering, and hanging up a call. It also supports supplementary functions, such as hold, transfer, conference, and call park found in PBX, ISDN, and other telephone systems. 

TAPI is used primarily to control either modems or, more recently, to control business telephone system (PBX) handsets. When controlling a PBX handset, the driver is provided by the manufacturer of the telephone system. Some manufacturers provide drivers that allow the control of multiple handsets. This is traditionally called &quot;third-party control&quot;. Other manufacturers provide drivers that allow the control of a single handset. This is called &quot;first-party control&quot;. Third-party drivers are designed to allow applications to see and/or control multiple extensions at the same time. Some telephone systems only permit one third-party connection at a time. First-party drivers are designed to allow applications to monitor and/or control one extension at a time. Telephone systems naturally permit many of these connections simultaneously. Modem connections are by nature first-party.

TAPI can also be used to control voice-enabled telephony devices, including voice modems and dedicated hardware such as Dialogic cards.

== History ==
TAPI was introduced in 1993 as the result of joint development by Microsoft and Intel. The first publicly available version of TAPI was version 1.3, which was released as a patch on top of Microsoft Windows 3.1. Version 1.3 drivers were 16-bit only. Version 1.3 is no longer supported, although some MSDN development library CDs still contain the files and patches.

With Microsoft Windows 95, TAPI was integrated into the operating system. The first version on Windows 95 was TAPI 1.4. TAPI 1.4 had support for 32-bit applications.

The TAPI standard supports both connections from individual computers and LAN connections serving any number of computers.

TAPI 2.0 was introduced with Windows NT 4.0. Version 2.0 was the first version on the Windows NT platform. It made a significant step forward by supporting ACD and PBX-specific functionality.

In 1997, Microsoft released TAPI version 2.1. This version of TAPI was available as a downloadable update and was the first version to be supported on both the Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows NT/2000 platforms.

TAPI 3.0 was released in 1999 together with Windows 2000. This version enables IP telephony (VoIP) by providing simple and generic methods for making connections between two (using H.323) or more (using IP multicast) computers and now also offers the ability to access any media stream (MSP driver) involved in the connection.

Windows XP included both TAPI 3.1 and TAPI 2.2. TAPI 3.1 supports the Microsoft Component Object Model and provides a set of COM objects to application programmers. This version uses File Terminals which allow applications to record streaming data to a file and play this recorded data back to a stream. A USB Phone TSP (Telephony Service Provider) was also included which allows an application to control a USB phone and use it as a streaming endpoint. TAPI 3.0 or TAPI 3.1 are not available on operating systems earlier than Windows 2000 and Windows XP respectively.

The Telephony Server Application Programming Interface (TSAPI) is a similar standard developed by Novell for NetWare servers.

==Telephone address format==
TAPI uses Microsoft canonical address format for telephone numbers to make phone calls. It is a derivative of E.123 international notation.

The canonical address is a text string with the following format: codice_1. Area code, subaddress and name are optional; the latter can carry extension number for direct inward dialing and calling party name, as used by ISDN/E1/T1 telecommunication protocols.

Dialing rules are used to transform the canonical phone number into a dialable calling sequence for the modem, depending on the user&#x27;s location. The dialing rules include variable-length dialing for area code, trunk access and international access prefixes, as well as central office access and calling card/credit card numbers. 

The calling sequence can contain dialable numbers such as digits codice_2 and DTMF tones codice_3, formatting characters codice_4, and control characters codice_5 which correspond to the Dial command of the Hayes AT command set. The following control characters are defined: 

:! - hookflash, i.e. half second on-hook followed by half second off-hook;
:P - pulse dialing mode;
:T - tone dialing mode;
:, - pause dialing (duration specified by the device);
:W - wait for dial tone;
:@ - wait for &quot;quiet answer&quot;, i.e. the ringback tone followed by several seconds of silence;
:$ - wait for a billing signal, such as credit card prompt tone;
:? - indicates that the user is to be prompted before continuing (results in an application error since the API has no means to implement a user prompt);
:; - the number is not complete and will be finished later (only valid in a dialable number).

==TAPI 2.x vs TAPI 3.x==
It is a common misconception that TAPI 3.0 (or TAPI 3.1) replaces TAPI 2.x.

TAPI 2.x and earlier versions were written in C; the API uses pointers to structures. Consequently, TAPI 2.x is easy to access from C or C++ applications, but it can be awkward to use from many other programming languages.

TAPI 3.x was designed with a Component Object Model (COM) interface. This was done with the intent of making it accessible to higher level applications such as developed in VB or other environments that provide easy access to COM but don&#x27;t deal with C-style pointers. 

TAPI 3.x has a slightly different set of functionality than TAPI 2.x. The addition of integrated media control was the most significant addition. But TAPI 3.x doesn&#x27;t include all functionality that TAPI 2.x does, like support for the Phone class.

One very notable issue with TAPI 3.x is the lack of support for managed code (.NET environment). As documented in Microsoft KB Article 841712, Microsoft currently has no plans to support TAPI 3.x directly from .NET programming languages. However, Mark Smith has provided a managed C++ library called ITAPI3 and a 2.x wrapper for .NET. Other developers provide libraries to work indirectly with TAPI enabled PBXs.

One often overlooked reason an application developer might choose between TAPI 2.x and TAPI 3.x should be the hardware vendors recommendation. Even though TAPI provides an abstract model of phone lines, telephony applications are still heavily impacted by the specific behavior of the underlying hardware. Troubleshooting behavior issues usually requires both software and hardware vendors to collaborate. Because there is almost a 1:1 relationship between the TAPI Service Provider (TSP) interface and the TAPI 2.x interface, collaboration is often easier if the application is designed using TAPI 2.x. Experience with TAPI 3.x varies significantly between hardware vendors.

==TAPI compliant hardware==
On Windows, TAPI support was almost universal in telephony hardware such as voice modems (both internal and external) and computer expansion boards such as Dialogic telephony cards. The only notable exception who never natively supported TAPI was the Avaya Communication Manager, which relied solely on the TSAPI interface for connectivity.

Many PBX systems provide TAPI-compliant modem interfaces. TAPI compatible PBX solutions include Aastra (400/800), Aastra (MX-ONE), Alcatel (OXO/OXE), Avaya (BCM, IP Office), Cisco (Call Manager), Ericsson-LG (eMG80, iPECS, ipLDK), NEC-Philips (iS3000, IPC100/500), NEC (SL1000, SV8100/9100), Nitsuko (DXE600/328), Panasonic (KX-TDA/TDE/NCP, KX-NS1000), Samsung (OfficeServ), Unify (3000/4000, Openscape Office), ShoreTel, and ZyXEL (X6004/X2002).

Third party drivers are often available for the telephone systems that don&#x27;t have drivers made by the manufacturers.

<text>Economic history is the study of history using methodological tools from economics or with a special attention to economic phenomena. Research is conducted using a combination of historical methods, statistical methods and the application of economic theory to historical situations and institutions. The field can encompass a wide variety of topics, including equality, finance, technology, labour, and business. It emphasizes historicizing the economy itself, analyzing it as a dynamic entity and attempting to provide insights into the way it is structured and conceived.

Using both quantitative data and qualitative sources, economic historians emphasize understanding the historical context in which major economic events take place. They often focus on the institutional dynamics of systems of production, labor, and capital, as well as the economy&#x27;s impact on society, culture, and language. Scholars of the discipline may approach their analysis from the perspective of different schools of economic thought, such as mainstream economics, Austrian economics, Marxian economics, the Chicago school of economics, and Keynesian economics.

Economic history has several sub-disciplines. Historical methods are commonly applied in and business history, which overlap with areas of social history such as demographic and labor history. In the sub-discipline of cliometrics, economists use quantitative (econometric) methods. In history of capitalism, historians explain economic historical issues and processes from a historical point of view.

==Early history of the discipline==

Arnold Toynbee made the case for combining economics and history in his study of the Industrial Revolution, saying, &quot;I believe economics today is much too dissociated from history. Smith and Malthus had historical minds. However, Ricardo – who set the pattern of modern textbooks – had a mind that was entirely unhistorical.&quot; There were several advantages in combining economics and history according to Toynbee. To begin with, it improved economic understanding. &quot;We see abstract propositions in a new light when studying them in relation to historical facts. Propositions become more vivid and truthful.&quot; Meanwhile, studying history with economics makes history easier to understand. Economics teaches us to look out for the right facts in reading history and makes matters such as introducing enclosures, machinery, or new currencies more intelligible. Economics also teaches careful deductive reasoning. &quot;The habits of mind it instils are even more valuable than the knowledge of principles it gives. Without these habits, the mass of their materials can overwhelm students of historical facts.&quot;

In late-nineteenth-century Germany, scholars at a number of universities, led by Gustav von Schmoller, developed the historical school of economic history. It argued that there were no universal truths in history, emphasizing the importance of historical context without quantitative analysis. This historical approach dominated German and French scholarship for most of the 20th century. The historical school of economics included other economists such as Max Weber and Joseph Schumpeter who reasoned that careful analysis of human actions, cultural norms, historical context, and mathematical support was key to historical analysis. The approach was spread to Great Britain by William Ashley (University of Oxford) and dominated British economic history for much of the 20th century. Britain&#x27;s first professor in the subject was George Unwin at the University of Manchester. Meanwhile, in France, economic history was heavily influenced by the Annales School from the early 20th century to the present. It exerts a worldwide influence through its journal .

Treating economic history as a discrete academic discipline has been a contentious issue for many years. Academics at the London School of Economics (LSE) and the University of Cambridge had numerous disputes over the separation of economics and economic history in the interwar era. Cambridge economists believed that pure economics involved a component of economic history and that the two were inseparably entangled. Those at the LSE believed that economic history warranted its own courses, research agenda and academic chair separated from mainstream economics. In the initial period of the subject&#x27;s development, the LSE position of separating economic history from economics won out. Many universities in the UK developed independent programmes in economic history rooted in the LSE model. Indeed, the Economic History Society had its inauguration at LSE in 1926 and the University of Cambridge eventually established its own economic history programme.

In the United States, the field of economic history was largely subsumed into other fields of economics following the cliometric revolution of the 1960s. To many it became seen as a form of applied economics rather than a stand-alone discipline. Cliometrics, also known as the New Economic History, refers to the systematic use of economic theory and econometric techniques to the study of economic history. The term was originally coined by Jonathan R. T. Hughes and Stanley Reiter and refers to Clio, who was the muse of history and heroic poetry in Greek mythology. One of the most famous cliometric economic historians is Douglass North, who argued that it is the task of economic history to elucidate the historical dimensions of economies through time. Cliometricians argue their approach is necessary because the application of theory is crucial in writing solid economic history, while historians generally oppose this view warning against the risk of generating anachronisms.

Early cliometrics was a type of counterfactual history. However, counterfactualism was not its distinctive feature; it combined neoclassical economics with quantitative methods in order to explain human choices based on constraints. Some have argued that cliometrics had its heyday in the 1960s and 1970s and that it is now neglected by economists and historians. In response to North and Robert Fogel&#x27;s Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1993, Harvard University economist (and future Nobel winner) Claudia Goldin argued:Economic history is not a handmaiden of economics but a distinct field of scholarship. Economic history was a scholarly discipline long before it became cliometrics. Its practitioners were economists and historians studying the histories of economies... The new economic history, or cliometrics, formalized economic history in a manner similar to the injection of mathematical models and statistics into the rest of economics.The relationship between economic history, economics and history has long been the subject of intense discussion, and the debates of recent years echo those of early contributors. There has long been a school of thought among economic historians that splits economic history—the study of how economic phenomena evolved in the past—from historical economics—testing the generality of economic theory using historical episodes. US economic historian Charles P. Kindleberger explained this position in his 1990 book &quot;Historical Economics: Art or Science?&quot;. Economic historian Robert Skidelsky (University of Cambridge) argued that economic theory often employs ahistorical models and methodologies that do not take into account historical context. Yale University economist Irving Fisher already wrote in 1933 on the relationship between economics and economic history in his &quot;Debt-Deflation Theory of Great Depressions&quot;:

The study of dis-equilibrium may proceed in either of two ways. We may take as our unit for study an actual historical case of great dis-equilibrium, such as, say, the panic of 1873; or we may take as our unit for study any constituent tendency, such as, say, deflation, and discover its general laws, relations to, and combinations with, other tendencies. The former study revolves around events, or facts; the latter, around tendencies. The former is primarily economic history; the latter is primarily economic science. Both sorts of studies are proper and important. Each helps the other. The panic of 1873 can only be understood in light of the various tendencies involved—deflation and other; and deflation can only be understood in the light of various historical manifestations—1873 and other.
== Scope and focus of economic history today ==
The past three decades have witnessed the widespread closure of separate economic history departments and programmes in the UK and the integration of the discipline into either history or economics departments. Only the London School of Economics (LSE) retains a separate economic history department and stand-alone undergraduate and graduate programme in economic history. Cambridge, Glasgow, LSE, Oxford, Queen&#x27;s, and Warwick together train the vast majority of economic historians coming through the British higher education system today, but do so as part of economics or history degrees. Meanwhile, there have never been specialist economic history graduate programs at universities anywhere in the US. However, economic history remains a special field component of leading economics PhD programs, including University of California, Berkeley, Harvard University, Northwestern University, Princeton University, the University of Chicago and Yale University.

Despite the pessimistic view on the state of the discipline espoused by many of its practitioners, economic history remains an active field of social scientific inquiry. Indeed, it has seen something of a resurgence in interest since 2000, perhaps driven by research conducted at universities in continental Europe rather than the UK and the US. The overall number of economic historians in the world is estimated at 10,400, with Japan and China as well as the U.K and the U.S. ranking highest in numbers. Some less developed countries, however, are not sufficiently integrated in the world economic history community, among others, Senegal, Brazil and Vietnam.

Part of the growth in economic history is driven by the continued interest in big policy-relevant questions on the history of economic growth and development. MIT economist Peter Temin noted that development economics is intricately connected with economic history, as it explores the growth of economies with different technologies, innovations, and institutions. Studying economic growth has been popular for years among economists and historians who have sought to understand why some economies have grown faster than others. Some of the early texts in the field include Walt Whitman Rostow&#x27;s &quot;The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto&quot; (1971) which described how advanced economies grow after overcoming certain hurdles and advancing to the next stage in development. Another economic historian, Alexander Gerschenkron, complicated this theory with works on how economies develop in non-Western countries, as discussed in &quot;Economic Backwardness in Historical Perspective: A Book of Essays&quot; (1962). A more recent work is Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty&quot; (2012) which pioneered a new field of persistence studies, emphasizing the path-dependent stages of growth. Other notable books on the topic include Kenneth Pomeranz&#x27;s &quot;The Great Divergence: China, Europe, and the Making of the Modern World Economy&quot; (2000) and David S. Landes&#x27;s &quot;The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some are So Rich and Some So Poor&quot; (1998).

Since the 2007–2008 financial crisis, scholars have become more interested in a field which may be called &quot;new&quot; &#x27;new economic history&#x27;. Scholars have tended to move away from narrowly quantitative studies toward institutional, social, and cultural history affecting the evolution of economies. The focus of these studies is frequently on &quot;persistence&quot;, as past events are linked to present outcomes. Columbia University economist Charles Calomiris argued that this new field showed &#x27;how historical (path-dependent) processes governed changes in institutions and markets.&#x27; However, this trend has been criticized, most forcefully by Francesco Boldizzoni, as a form of economic imperialism &quot;extending the neoclassical explanatory model to the realm of social relations.&quot;

Conversely, economists in other specializations have started to write a new kind of economic history which makes use of historical data to understand the present day. A major development in this genre was the publication of Thomas Piketty&#x27;s &quot;Capital in the Twenty-First Century&quot; (2013). The book described the rise in wealth and income inequality since the 18th century, arguing that large concentrations of wealth lead to social and economic instability. Piketty also advocated a system of global progressive wealth taxes to correct rising inequality. The book was selected as a &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller and received numerous awards. The book was well received by some of the world&#x27;s major economists, including Paul Krugman, Robert Solow, and Ben Bernanke. Books in response to Piketty&#x27;s book include &quot;After Piketty: The Agenda for Economics and Inequality&quot;, by Heather Boushey, J. Bradford DeLong, and Marshall Steinbaum (eds.) (2017), &quot;Pocket Piketty&quot; by Jesper Roine (2017), and &quot;Anti-Piketty: Capital for the 21st Century&quot;, by Jean-Philippe Delsol, Nicolas Lecaussin, Emmanuel Martin (2017). One economist argued that Piketty&#x27;s book was &quot;Nobel-Prize worthy&quot; and noted that it had changed the global discussion on how economic historians study inequality. It has also sparked new conversations in the disciplines of public policy.

In addition to the mainstream in economic history, there is a parallel development in the field influenced by Karl Marx and Marxian economics. Marx used historical analysis to interpret the role of class and class as a central issue in history. He debated with the &quot;classical&quot; economists (a term he coined), including Adam Smith and David Ricardo. In turn, Marx&#x27;s legacy in economic history has been to critique the findings of neoclassical economists. Marxist analysis also confronts economic determinism, the theory that economic relationships are the foundation of political and societal institutions. Marx abstracted the idea of a &quot;capitalist mode of production&quot; as a way of identifying the transition from feudalism to capitalism. This has influenced some scholars, such as Maurice Dobb, to argue that feudalism declined because of peasants&#x27; struggles for freedom and the growing inefficiency of feudalism as a system of production. In turn, in what was later coined the Brenner debate, Paul Sweezy, a Marxian economist, challenged Dobb&#x27;s definition of feudalism and its focus only on western Europe.

==History of capitalism==
A new field, called &quot;history of capitalism&quot; by researchers engaged in it, has emerged in US history departments since about the year 2000. It includes many topics traditionally associated with the field of economic history, such as insurance, banking and regulation, the political dimension of business, and the impact of capitalism on the middle classes, the poor and women and minorities. The field has particularly focused on the contribution of slavery to the rise of the US economy in the nineteenth century. The field utilizes the existing research of business history, but has sought to make it more relevant to the concerns of history departments in the United States, including by having limited or no discussion of individual business enterprises. Historians of capitalism have countered these critiques, citing the issues with economic history. As University of Chicago professor of history Jonathan Levy states, &quot;modern economic history began with industrialization and urbanization, and, even then, environmental considerations were subsidiary, if not nonexistent.&quot;

Scholars have critiqued the history of capitalism because it does not focus on systems of production, circulation, and distribution. Some have criticized its lack of social scientific methods and its ideological biases. As a result, a new academic journal, &quot;&quot;, was founded at the University of Pennsylvania under the direction of Marc Flandreau (University of Pennsylvania), Julia Ott (The New School, New York) and Francesca Trivellato (Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton) to widen the scope of the field. The journal&#x27;s goal is to bring together &quot;historians and social scientists interested in the material and intellectual aspects of modern economic life.&quot;

==Academic journals and societies==
The first journal specializing in the field of economic history was &quot;The Economic History Review&quot;, founded in 1927, as the main publication of the Economic History Society. The first journal featured a publication by Professor Sir William Ashley, the first Professor of Economic History in the English-speaking world, who described the emerging field of economic history. The discipline existed alongside long-standing fields such as political history, religious history, and military history as one that focused on humans&#x27; interactions with &#x27;visible happenings&#x27;. He continued, &#x27;[economic history] primarily and unless expressly extended, the history of actual human practice with respect to the material basis of life. The visible happenings with regard-to use the old formula-to &quot;the production, distribution, and consumption of wealth&quot; form our wide enough field&#x27;.

Later, the Economic History Association established another academic journal, &quot;The Journal of Economic History&quot;, in 1941 as a way of expanding the discipline in the United States. The first president of the Economic History Association, Edwin F. Gay, described the aim of economic history as to provide new perspectives in the economics and history disciplines: &#x27;An adequate equipment with two skills, that of the historian and the economist, is not easily acquired, but experience shows that it is both necessary and possible&#x27;. Other related academic journals have broadened the lens with which economic history is studied. These interdisciplinary journals include the &quot;Business History Review&quot;, &quot;European Review of Economic History&quot;, &quot;Enterprise and Society&quot;, and &quot;Financial History Review&quot;.

The &quot;International Economic History Association&quot;, an association of close to 50 member organizations, recognizes some of the major academic organizations dedicated to study of economic history: the Business History Conference, Economic History Association, Economic History Society, European Association of Business Historians, and the International Social History Association.

<text>In multi-threaded computer programming, a function is thread-safe when it can be invoked or accessed concurrently by multiple threads without causing unexpected behavior, race conditions, or data corruption. As in the multi-threaded context where a program executes several threads simultaneously in a shared address space and each of those threads has access to every other thread&#x27;s memory, thread-safe functions need to ensure that all those threads behave properly and fulfill their design specifications without unintended interaction.

There are various strategies for making thread-safe data structures.

==Levels of thread safety==
Different vendors use slightly different terminology for thread-safety, but the most commonly use thread-safety terminology are:
*Not thread safe: Data structures should not be accessed simultaneously by different threads.
*Thread safe, serialization: Use a single mutex for all resources to guarantee the thread to be free of race conditions when those resources are accessed by multiple threads simultaneously.
*Thread safe, MT-safe: Use a mutex for every single resource to guarantee the thread to be free of race conditions when those resources are accessed by multiple threads simultaneously.

Thread safety guarantees usually also include design steps to prevent or limit the risk of different forms of deadlocks, as well as optimizations to maximize concurrent performance. However, deadlock-free guarantees cannot always be given, since deadlocks can be caused by callbacks and violation of architectural layering independent of the library itself.

Software libraries can provide certain thread-safety guarantees. For example, concurrent reads might be guaranteed to be thread-safe, but concurrent writes might not be. Whether a program using such a library is thread-safe depends on whether it uses the library in a manner consistent with those guarantees.

==Implementation approaches==
Listed are two classes of approaches for avoiding race conditions to achieve thread-safety.

The first class of approaches focuses on avoiding shared state and includes:
; Re-entrancy: Writing code in such a way that it can be partially executed by a thread, executed by the same thread, or simultaneously executed by another thread and still correctly complete the original execution. This requires the saving of state information in variables local to each execution, usually on a stack, instead of in static or global variables or other non-local state. All non-local states must be accessed through atomic operations and the data-structures must also be reentrant.
; Thread-local storage: Variables are localized so that each thread has its own private copy. These variables retain their values across subroutine and other code boundaries and are thread-safe since they are local to each thread, even though the code which accesses them might be executed simultaneously by another thread.
; Immutable objects: The state of an object cannot be changed after construction. This implies both that only read-only data is shared and that inherent thread safety is attained. Mutable (non-const) operations can then be implemented in such a way that they create new objects instead of modifying the existing ones. This approach is characteristic of functional programming and is also used by the &quot;string&quot; implementations in Java, C#, and Python. (See Immutable object.)

The second class of approaches are synchronization-related, and are used in situations where shared state cannot be avoided:
;Mutual exclusion: Access to shared data is &quot;serialized&quot; using mechanisms that ensure only one thread reads or writes to the shared data at any time. Incorporation of mutual exclusion needs to be well thought out, since improper usage can lead to side-effects like deadlocks, livelocks, and resource starvation.
; Atomic operations: Shared data is accessed by using atomic operations which cannot be interrupted by other threads. This usually requires using special machine language instructions, which might be available in a runtime library. Since the operations are atomic, the shared data is always kept in a valid state, no matter how other threads access it. Atomic operations form the basis of many thread locking mechanisms, and are used to implement mutual exclusion primitives.

==Examples==

In the following piece of Java code, the Java keyword synchronized makes the method thread-safe:
class Counter {
 private int i = 0;

 public synchronized void inc() {
 i++;
}
In the C programming language, each thread has its own stack. However, a static variable is not kept on the stack; all threads share simultaneous access to it. If multiple threads overlap while running the same function, it is possible that a static variable might be changed by one thread while another is midway through checking it. This difficult-to-diagnose logic error, which may compile and run properly most of the time, is called a race condition. One common way to avoid this is to use another shared variable as a &quot;lock&quot; or &quot;mutex&quot; (from mutual exclusion).

In the following piece of C code, the function is thread-safe, but not reentrant:

# include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

int increment_counter ()
 static int counter = 0;
 static pthread_mutex_t mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

 // only allow one thread to increment at a time
 pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;mutex);

 ++counter;

 // store value before any other threads increment it further
 int result = counter;

 pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;mutex);

 return result;


In the above, codice_1 can be called by different threads without any problem since a mutex is used to synchronize all access to the shared codice_2 variable. But if the function is used in a reentrant interrupt handler and a second interrupt arises while the mutex is locked, the second routine will hang forever. As interrupt servicing can disable other interrupts, the whole system could suffer.

The same function can be implemented to be both thread-safe and reentrant using the lock-free atomics in C++11:

# include &lt;atomic&gt;

int increment_counter ()
 static std::atomic&lt;int&gt; counter(0);

 // increment is guaranteed to be done atomically
 int result = ++counter;

 return result;

<text>Bottom-up and top-down are both strategies of information processing and ordering knowledge, used in a variety of fields including software, humanistic and scientific theories (see systemics), and management and organization. In practice they can be seen as a style of thinking, teaching, or leadership.

A top-down approach (also known as &quot;stepwise design&quot; and stepwise refinement and in some cases used as a synonym of &quot;decomposition&quot;) is essentially the breaking down of a system to gain insight into its compositional subsystems in a reverse engineering fashion. In a top-down approach an overview of the system is formulated, specifying, but not detailing, any first-level subsystems. Each subsystem is then refined in yet greater detail, sometimes in many additional subsystem levels, until the entire specification is reduced to base elements. A top-down model is often specified with the assistance of black boxes, which makes it easier to manipulate. However, black boxes may fail to clarify elementary mechanisms or be detailed enough to realistically validate the model. A top-down approach starts with the big picture, then breaks down into smaller segments.

A bottom-up approach is the piecing together of systems to give rise to more complex systems, thus making the original systems subsystems of the emergent system. Bottom-up processing is a type of information processing based on incoming data from the environment to form a perception. From a cognitive psychology perspective, information enters the eyes in one direction (sensory input, or the &quot;bottom&quot;), and is then turned into an image by the brain that can be interpreted and recognized as a perception (output that is &quot;built up&quot; from processing to final cognition). In a bottom-up approach the individual base elements of the system are first specified in great detail. These elements are then linked together to form larger subsystems, which then in turn are linked, sometimes in many levels, until a complete top-level system is formed. This strategy often resembles a &quot;seed&quot; model, by which the beginnings are small but eventually grow in complexity and completeness. But &quot;organic strategies&quot; may result in a tangle of elements and subsystems, developed in isolation and subject to local optimization as opposed to meeting a global purpose.

==Product design and development==
During the development of new products, designers and engineers rely on both bottom-up and top-down approaches. The bottom-up approach is being used when off-the-shelf or existing components are selected and integrated into the product. An example includes selecting a particular fastener, such as a bolt, and designing the receiving components such that the fastener will fit properly. In a top-down approach, a custom fastener would be designed such that it would fit properly in the receiving components. For perspective, for a product with more restrictive requirements (such as weight, geometry, safety, environment), such as a spacesuit, a more top-down approach is taken and almost everything is custom designed.

==Computer science==

===Software development===
:&quot;Part of this section is from the Perl Design Patterns Book&quot;.

In the software development process, the top-down and bottom-up approaches play a key role.

Top-down approaches emphasize planning and a complete understanding of the system. It is inherent that no coding can begin until a sufficient level of detail has been reached in the design of at least some part of the system. Top-down approaches are implemented by attaching the stubs in place of the module. But these delay testing of the ultimate functional units of a system until significant design is complete.

Bottom-up emphasizes coding and early testing, which can begin as soon as the first module has been specified. But this approach runs the risk that modules may be coded without having a clear idea of how they link to other parts of the system, and that such linking may not be as easy as first thought. Re-usability of code is one of the main benefits of a bottom-up approach.

Top-down design was promoted in the 1970s by IBM researchers Harlan Mills and Niklaus Wirth. Mills developed structured programming concepts for practical use and tested them in a 1969 project to automate the &quot;New York Times&quot; morgue index. The engineering and management success of this project led to the spread of the top-down approach through IBM and the rest of the computer industry. Among other achievements, Niklaus Wirth, the developer of Pascal programming language, wrote the influential paper &quot;Program Development by Stepwise Refinement&quot;. Since Niklaus Wirth went on to develop languages such as Modula and Oberon (where one could define a module before knowing about the entire program specification), one can infer that top-down programming was not strictly what he promoted. Top-down methods were favored in software engineering until the late 1980s, and object-oriented programming assisted in demonstrating the idea that both aspects of top-down and bottom-up programming could be used.

Modern software design approaches usually combine top-down and bottom-up approaches. Although an understanding of the complete system is usually considered necessary for good design—leading theoretically to a top-down approach—most software projects attempt to make use of existing code to some degree. Pre-existing modules give designs a bottom-up flavor.

===Programming===
Top-down is a programming style, the mainstay of traditional procedural languages, in which design begins by specifying complex pieces and then dividing them into successively smaller pieces. The technique for writing a program using top-down methods is to write a main procedure that names all the major functions it will need. Later, the programming team looks at the requirements of each of those functions and the process is repeated. These compartmentalized subroutines eventually will perform actions so simple they can be easily and concisely coded. When all the various subroutines have been coded the program is ready for testing. By defining how the application comes together at a high level, lower-level work can be self-contained. 

In a bottom-up approach the individual base elements of the system are first specified in great detail. These elements are then linked together to form larger subsystems, which in turn are linked, sometimes at many levels, until a complete top-level system is formed. This strategy often resembles a &quot;seed&quot; model, by which the beginnings are small, but eventually grow in complexity and completeness. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm that uses &quot;objects&quot; to design applications and computer programs. In mechanical engineering with software programs such as Pro/ENGINEER, Solidworks, and Autodesk Inventor users can design products as pieces not part of the whole and later add those pieces together to form assemblies like building with Lego. Engineers call this &quot;piece part design&quot;.

=== Parsing ===

Parsing is the process of analyzing an input sequence (such as that read from a file or a keyboard) in order to determine its grammatical structure. This method is used in the analysis of both natural languages and computer languages, as in a compiler. Bottom-up parsing is parsing strategy that recognizes the text&#x27;s lowest-level small details first, before its mid-level structures, and leaves the highest-level overall structure to last. In top-down parsing, on the other hand, one first looks at the highest level of the parse tree and works down the parse tree by using the rewriting rules of a formal grammar.

== Nanotechnology ==

Top-down and bottom-up are two approaches for the manufacture of products. These terms were first applied to the field of nanotechnology by the Foresight Institute in 1989 to distinguish between molecular manufacturing (to mass-produce large atomically precise objects) and conventional manufacturing (which can mass-produce large objects that are not atomically precise). Bottom-up approaches seek to have smaller (usually molecular) components built up into more complex assemblies, while top-down approaches seek to create nanoscale devices by using larger, externally controlled ones to direct their assembly. Certain valuable nanostructures, such as Silicon nanowires, can be fabricated using either approach, with processing methods selected on the basis of targeted applications.

A top-down approach often uses the traditional workshop or microfabrication methods where externally controlled tools are used to cut, mill, and shape materials into the desired shape and order. Micropatterning techniques, such as photolithography and inkjet printing belong to this category. Vapor treatment can be regarded as a new top-down secondary approaches to engineer nanostructures.

Bottom-up approaches, in contrast, use the chemical properties of single molecules to cause single-molecule components to (a) self-organize or self-assemble into some useful conformation, or (b) rely on positional assembly. These approaches use the concepts of molecular self-assembly and/or molecular recognition. See also Supramolecular chemistry. Such bottom-up approaches should, broadly speaking, be able to produce devices in parallel and much cheaper than top-down methods but could potentially be overwhelmed as the size and complexity of the desired assembly increases.

== Neuroscience and psychology ==
These terms are also employed in cognitive sciences including neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology to discuss the flow of information in processing. Typically, sensory input is considered bottom-up, and higher cognitive processes, which have more information from other sources, are considered top-down. A bottom-up process is characterized by an absence of higher-level direction in sensory processing, whereas a top-down process is characterized by a high level of direction of sensory processing by more cognition, such as goals or targets (Biederman, 19).

According to college teaching notes written by Charles Ramskov, Irvin Rock, Neiser, and Richard Gregory claim that the top-down approach involves perception that is an active and constructive process. Additionally, it is an approach not directly given by stimulus input, but is the result of stimulus, internal hypotheses, and expectation interactions. According to theoretical synthesis, &quot;when a stimulus is presented short and clarity is uncertain that gives a vague stimulus, perception becomes a top-down approach.&quot;

Conversely, psychology defines bottom-up processing as an approach in which there is a progression from the individual elements to the whole. According to Ramskov, one proponent of bottom-up approach, Gibson, claims that it is a process that includes visual perception that needs information available from proximal stimulus produced by the distal stimulus. Theoretical synthesis also claims that bottom-up processing occurs &quot;when a stimulus is presented long and clearly enough.&quot;

Certain cognitive processes, such as fast reactions or quick visual identification, are considered bottom-up processes because they rely primarily on sensory information, whereas processes such as motor control and directed attention are considered top-down because they are goal directed. Neurologically speaking, some areas of the brain, such as area V1 mostly have bottom-up connections. Other areas, such as the fusiform gyrus have inputs from higher brain areas and are considered to have top-down influence.

The study of visual attention is an example. If your attention is drawn to a flower in a field, it may be because the color or shape of the flower are visually salient. The information that caused you to attend to the flower came to you in a bottom-up fashion—your attention was not contingent on knowledge of the flower: the outside stimulus was sufficient on its own. Contrast this situation with one in which you are looking for a flower. You have a representation of what you are looking for. When you see the object, you are looking for, it is salient. This is an example of the use of top-down information.

In cognition, two thinking approaches are distinguished. &quot;Top-down&quot; (or &quot;big chunk&quot;) is stereotypically the visionary, or the person who sees the larger picture and overview. Such people focus on the big picture and from that derive the details to support it. &quot;Bottom-up&quot; (or &quot;small chunk&quot;) cognition is akin to focusing on the detail primarily, rather than the landscape. The expression &quot;seeing the wood for the trees&quot; references the two styles of cognition.

Studies in task switching and response selection show that there are differences through the two types of processing. Top-down processing primarily focuses on the attention side, such as task repetition.  Bottom-up processing focuses on item-based learning, such as finding the same object over and over again. Implications for understanding attentional control of response selection in conflict situations are discussed.

This also applies to how we structure these processing neurologically. With structuring information interfaces in our neurological processes for procedural learning. These processes were proven effective to work in our interface design. But although both top-down principles were effective in guiding interface design; they were not sufficient. They can be combined with iterative bottom-up methods to produce usable interfaces .

=== Schooling ===
Undergraduate (or bachelor) students are taught the basis of top-down bottom-up processing around their third year in the program. Going through four main parts of the processing when viewing it from a learning perspective. The two main definitions are that bottom-up processing is determined directly by environmental stimuli rather than the individual&#x27;s knowledge and expectations.

=== Management and organization ===
In the fields of management and organization, the terms &quot;top-down&quot; and &quot;bottom-up&quot; are used to describe how decisions are made and/or how change is implemented.

A &quot;top-down&quot; approach is where an executive decision maker or other top person makes the decisions of how something should be done. This approach is disseminated under their authority to lower levels in the hierarchy, who are, to a greater or lesser extent, bound by them. For example, when wanting to make an improvement in a hospital, a hospital administrator might decide that a major change (such as implementing a new program) is needed, and then use a planned approach to drive the changes down to the frontline staff.

A bottom-up approach to changes is one that works from the grassroots, and originates in a flat structure with people working together, causing a decision to arise from their joint involvement. A decision by a number of activists, students, or victims of some incident to take action is a &quot;bottom-up&quot; decision. A bottom-up approach can be thought of as &quot;an incremental change approach that represents an emergent process cultivated and upheld primarily by frontline workers&quot;.

Positive aspects of top-down approaches include their efficiency and superb overview of higher levels; and external effects can be internalized. On the negative side, if reforms are perceived to be imposed &quot;from above&quot;, it can be difficult for lower levels to accept them. Evidence suggests this to be true regardless of the content of reforms. A bottom-up approach allows for more experimentation and a better feeling for what is needed at the bottom. Other evidence suggests that there is a third combination approach to change.

===Public health===

Both top-down and bottom-up approaches are used in public health. There are many examples of top-down programs, often run by governments or large inter-governmental organizations; many of these are disease-or issue-specific, such as HIV control or smallpox eradication. Examples of bottom-up programs include many small NGOs set up to improve local access to healthcare. But many programs seek to combine both approaches; for instance, guinea worm eradication, a single-disease international program currently run by the Carter Center has involved the training of many local volunteers, boosting bottom-up capacity, as have international programs for hygiene, sanitation, and access to primary healthcare.

== Architecture ==

Often the École des Beaux-Arts school of design is said to have primarily promoted top-down design because it taught that an architectural design should begin with a parti, a basic plan drawing of the overall project.

By contrast, the Bauhaus focused on bottom-up design. This method manifested itself in the study of translating small-scale organizational systems to a larger, more architectural scale (as with the wood panel carving and furniture design).

== Ecology ==
In ecology top-down control refers to when a top predator controls the structure or population dynamics of the ecosystem. The interactions between these top predators and their prey are what influences lower trophic levels. Changes in the top level of trophic levels have an inverse effect on the lower trophic levels. Top-down control can have negative effects on the surrounding ecosystem if there is a drastic change in the number of predators. The classic example is of kelp forest ecosystems. In such ecosystems, sea otters are a keystone predator. They prey on urchins, which in turn eat kelp. When otters are removed, urchin populations grow and reduce the kelp forest creating urchin barrens. This reduces the diversity of the ecosystem as a whole and can have detrimental effects on all of the other organisms. In other words, such ecosystems are not controlled by productivity of the kelp, but rather, a top predator. One can see the inverse effect that top-down control has in this example; when the population of otters decreased, the population of the urchins increased.

Bottom-up control in ecosystems refers to ecosystems in which the nutrient supply, productivity, and type of primary producers (plants and phytoplankton) control the ecosystem structure. If there are not enough resources or producers in the ecosystem, there is not enough energy left for the rest of the animals in the food chain because of biomagnification and ecological efficiency. An example would be how plankton populations are controlled by the availability of nutrients. Plankton populations tend to be higher and more complex in areas where upwelling brings nutrients to the surface.

There are many different examples of these concepts. It is common for populations to be influenced by both types of control, and there are still debates going on as to which type of control affects food webs in certain ecosystems.

== Philosophy and ethics ==

Top-down reasoning in ethics is when the reasoner starts from abstract universalizable principles and then reasons down them to particular situations. Bottom-up reasoning occurs when the reasoner starts from intuitive particular situational judgements and then reasons up to principles. Reflective equilibrium occurs when there is interaction between top-down and bottom-up reasoning until both are in harmony. That is to say, when universalizable abstract principles are reflectively found to be in equilibrium with particular intuitive judgements. The process occurs when cognitive dissonance occurs when reasoners try to resolve top-down with bottom-up reasoning, and adjust one or the other, until they are satisfied, they have found the best combinations of principles and situational judgements.

<doc id="45636" wikidata="Q1144729" url="?curid=45636" title="Turbo C">
<text>Turbo C is a discontinued integrated development environment (IDE) and compiler for the C programming language from Borland. First introduced in 1987, it was noted for its integrated development environment, small size, fast compile speed, comprehensive manuals and low price.

In May 1990, Borland replaced Turbo C with Turbo C++. In 2006, Borland reintroduced the Turbo moniker.

==Early history==
In the early 1980s, Borland enjoyed considerable success with their Turbo Pascal product and it became a popular choice when developing applications for the PC. Borland followed up that success by releasing Turbo Prolog (in 1986), and in 1987, Turbo Basic and Turbo C. Turbo C has similar properties to Turbo Pascal: an integrated development environment, a fast compiler (though not near the speed of Turbo Pascal), a good editor, and a competitive price.

Turbo C competed with other professional programming tools, such as Microsoft C, Watcom C, and Lattice C, while Turbo Pascal was successful with hobbyists and schools as well as professional programmers.

==Version history==
Version 1.0 (May 13, 1987) offered the first integrated development environment for C on IBM PCs. Like many Borland products of the time, the software was bought from another company (in this case Wizard C compiler by Bob Jervis), and branded with the &quot;Turbo&quot; name. It ran in of memory. It allowed inline assembly with full access to C symbolic names and structures, supported all memory models, and offered optimizations for speed, size, constant folding, and jump elimination.
Version 1.5 (January 1988) was an incremental improvement over version 1.0. It included more sample programs, improved manuals and bug fixes. It was shipped on five 360 KB diskettes of uncompressed files, and came with sample C programs, including a stripped down spreadsheet called mcalc. This version introduced the &lt;conio.h&gt; header file (which provided fast, PC-specific console I/O routines).
Version 2.0 (late 1988) featured the first &quot;blue screen&quot; version, which would be typical of all future Borland releases for MS-DOS. It was also available bundled with Turbo Assembler and Turbo Debugger. Turbo C 2.0 was also released (in Germany only) for the Atari ST; the program was not maintained by Borland, but sold and renamed PureC. This version introduced the &lt;graphics.h&gt; header file, which provided the Borland Graphics Interface already included in Turbo Pascal. 

With the release of Turbo C++ 1.0 (in 1990), the two products were folded into one and the name &quot;Turbo C&quot; was discontinued. The C++ compiler was developed under contract by a company in San Diego, and was one of the first &quot;true&quot; compilers for C++ (until then, it was common to use pre-compilers that generated C code, ref. Cfront).

== Freeware release ==
In 2006, Borland&#x27;s successor, Embarcadero Technologies, re-released Turbo C and the MS-DOS versions of the Turbo C++ compilers as freeware.

==Reception==
&quot;BYTE&quot; in January 1989 listed Turbo C and Turbo Pascal as among the &quot;Distinction&quot; winners of the BYTE Awards. Citing their user interface and continued emphasis on speed, the magazine stated that &quot;for rapid prototyping there&#x27;s not much better&quot;. In a February 1989 overview of optimizing C compilers, &quot;BYTE&quot; said that Turbo C Professional 2.0 &quot;is no exception&quot; to the company&#x27;s &quot;well-deserved reputation for pricing good software&quot;. The magazine reported that Turbo C &quot;compiles faster—&quot;much&quot; faster—than any other compiler we reviewed&quot;, and praised the addition of Turbo Debugger (&quot;the best source debugger&quot;). &quot;BYTE&quot; concluded that Turbo C did not produce the fastest or smallest executable, &quot;but it&#x27;s definitely the one that is most fun to use&quot;.

<doc id="45638" wikidata="Q4316107" url="?curid=45638" title="Undocumented feature">
<text>An undocumented feature is an unintended or undocumented hardware operation, for example an undocumented instruction, or software feature found in computer hardware and software that is considered beneficial or useful. Sometimes the documentation is omitted through oversight, but undocumented features are sometimes not intended for use by end users, but left available for use by the vendor for software support and development. Also, some unintended operation of hardware or software that ends up being of utility to users is simply a bug, flaw or quirk.

Since the suppliers of the software usually consider the software documentation to constitute a contract for the behavior of the software, undocumented features are generally left unsupported and may be removed or changed at will and without notice to the users.

Undocumented or unsupported features are sometimes also called &quot;not manufacturer supported&quot; (NOMAS), a term coined by &quot;PPC Journal&quot; in the early 1980s.
Some user-reported defects are viewed by software developers as working as expected, leading to the catchphrase &quot;it&#x27;s not a bug, it&#x27;s a feature&quot; (INABIAF) and its variations.

== Hardware ==
Undocumented instructions, known as illegal opcodes, on the MOS Technology 6502 and its variants are sometimes used by programmers. These were removed in the WDC 65C02.
Video game and demoscene programmers have taken advantage of the unintended operation of computers&#x27; hardware to produce new effects or optimizations.

In 2019, researchers discovered that a manufacturer debugging mode, known as VISA, had an undocumented feature on Intel Platform Controller Hubs (PCHs), chipsets included on most Intel-based motherboards, which makes the mode accessible with a normal motherboard. Since the chipset has direct memory access this is problematic for security reasons.

== Software == 
Undocumented features (for example, the ability to change the switch character in MS-DOS, usually to a hyphen) can be included for compatibility purposes (in this case with Unix utilities) or for future-expansion reasons. However; if the software provider changes their software strategy to better align with the business, the absence of documentation makes it easier to justify the feature&#x27;s removal.

New versions of software might omit mention of old (possibly superseded) features in documentation but keep them implemented for users who&#x27;ve grown accustomed to them.

In some cases, software bugs are referred to by developers either jokingly or conveniently as undocumented features. This usage may have been popularised in some of Microsoft&#x27;s responses to bug reports for its first Word for Windows product, but does not originate there. The oldest surviving reference on Usenet dates to 5 March 1984. Between 1969 and 1972, Sandy Mathes, a systems programmer for PDP-8 software at Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in Maynard, MA, used the terms &quot;bug&quot; and &quot;feature&quot; in her reporting of test results to distinguish between undocumented actions of delivered software products that were &quot;unacceptable&quot; and &quot;tolerable&quot;, respectively. This usage may have been perpetuated.

Undocumented features themselves have become a major feature of computer games. Developers often include various cheats and other special features (&quot;easter eggs&quot;) that are not explained in the packaged material, but have become part of the &quot;buzz&quot; about the game on the Internet and among gamers. The undocumented features of foreign games are often elements that were not localized from their native language.

Closed source APIs can also have undocumented functions that are not generally known. These are sometimes used to gain a commercial advantage over third-party software by providing additional information or better performance to the application provider.

<doc id="45639" wikidata="Q312555" url="?curid=45639" title="Bal Gangadhar Tilak">
<text>Bal Gangadhar Tilak (; born Keshav Gangadhar Tilak (pronunciation: ); 23 July 1856 – 1 August 1920), endeared as Lokmanya (IAST: &quot;Lokamānya&quot;), was an Indian nationalist, teacher, and an independence activist. He was one third of the Lal Bal Pal triumvirate. The British colonial authorities called him &quot;The father of the Indian unrest&quot;. He was also conferred with the title of &quot;Lokmanya&quot;, which means &quot;accepted by the people as their leader&quot;. Mahatma Gandhi called him &quot;The Maker of Modern India&quot;.

Tilak was one of the first and strongest advocates of Swaraj (&#x27;self-rule&#x27;) and a strong radical in Indian consciousness. He is known for his quote in Marathi: &quot;Swaraj is my birthright and I shall have it!&quot;. He formed a close alliance with many Indian National Congress leaders including Bipin Chandra Pal, Lala Lajpat Rai, Aurobindo Ghose, V. O. Chidambaram Pillai and Muhammad Ali Jinnah.

==Early life==

Keshav Gangadhar Tilak was born on 23 July 1856 in a Marathi Hindu Chitpavan Brahmin family in Ratnagiri, the headquarters of the Ratnagiri district of present-day Maharashtra (then Bombay Presidency). His ancestral village was Chikhali. His father, Gangadhar Tilak was a school teacher and a Sanskrit scholar who died when Tilak was sixteen. In 1871, Tilak was married to Tapibai (Née Bal) when he was sixteen, a few months before his father&#x27;s death. After marriage, her name was changed to Satyabhamabai. He obtained his Bachelor of Arts in first class in Mathematics from Deccan College of Pune in 1877. He left his M.A. course of study midway to join the L.L.B course instead, and in 1879 he obtained his L.L.B degree from Government Law College. After graduating, Tilak started teaching mathematics at a private school in Pune. Later, due to ideological differences with the colleagues in the new school, he withdrew and became a journalist. Tilak actively participated in public affairs. He stated: &quot;Religion and practical life are not different. The real spirit is to make the country your family instead of working only for your own. The step beyond is to serve humanity and the next step is to serve God.&quot;
Inspired by Vishnushastri Chiplunkar, he co-founded the New English school for secondary education in 1880 with a few of his college friends, including Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, Mahadev Ballal Namjoshi and Vishnushastri Chiplunkar. Their goal was to improve the quality of education for India&#x27;s youth. The success of the school led them to set up the Deccan Education Society in 1884 to create a new system of education that taught young Indians nationalist ideas through an emphasis on Indian culture. The Society established the Fergusson College in 1885 for post-secondary studies. Tilak taught mathematics at Fergusson College. In 1890, Tilak left the Deccan Education Society for more openly political work. He began a mass movement towards independence by an emphasis on a religious and cultural revival.

== Political career ==
Tilak had a long political career agitating for Indian autonomy from British colonial rule. Before Gandhi, he was the most widely known Indian political leader. Unlike his fellow Maharashtrian contemporary, Gokhale, Tilak was considered a radical Nationalist but a Social conservative. He was imprisoned on a number of occasions that included a long stint at Mandalay. At one stage in his political life he was called &quot;the father of Indian unrest&quot; by British author Sir Valentine Chirol.

===Indian National Congress===
Tilak joined the Indian National Congress in 1890. He opposed its moderate attitude, especially towards the fight for self-government. He was one of the most-eminent radicals at the time. In fact, it was the Swadeshi movement of 1905–1907 that resulted in the split within the Indian National Congress into the Moderates and the Extremists.

During late 1896, a bubonic plague spread from Bombay to Pune, and by January 1897, it reached epidemic proportions. The British Indian Army was brought in to deal with the emergency and strict measures were employed to curb the plague, including the allowance of forced entry into private houses, the examination of the house&#x27;s occupants, evacuation to hospitals and quarantine camps, removing and destroying personal possessions, and preventing patients from entering or leaving the city. By the end of May, the epidemic was under control. The measures used to curb the pandemic caused widespread resentment among the Indian public. Tilak took up this issue by publishing inflammatory articles in his paper Kesari (Kesari was written in Marathi, and &quot;Maratha&quot; was written in English), quoting the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita, to say that no blame could be attached to anyone who killed an oppressor without any thought of reward. Following this, on 22 June 1897, Commissioner Rand and another British officer, Lt. Ayerst were shot and killed by the Chapekar brothers and their other associates. According to Barbara and Thomas R. Metcalf, Tilak &quot;almost surely concealed the identities of the perpetrators&quot;. Tilak was charged with incitement to murder and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. When he emerged from prison in present-day Mumbai, he was revered as a martyr and a national hero. He adopted a new slogan coined by his associate Kaka Baptista: &quot;Swaraj (self-rule) is my birthright and I shall have it.&quot;

Following the Partition of Bengal, which was a strategy set out by Lord Curzon to weaken the nationalist movement, Tilak encouraged the Swadeshi movement and the Boycott movement. The movement consisted of the boycott of foreign goods and also the social boycott of any Indian who used foreign goods. The Swadeshi movement consisted of the usage of natively produced goods. Once foreign goods were boycotted, there was a gap which had to be filled by the production of those goods in India itself. Tilak said that the Swadeshi and Boycott movements are two sides of the same coin.
Tilak opposed the moderate views of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and was supported by fellow Indian nationalists Bipin Chandra Pal in Bengal and Lala Lajpat Rai in Punjab. They were referred to as the &quot;Lal-Bal-Pal triumvirate&quot;. In 1907, the annual session of the Congress Party was held at Surat, Gujarat. Trouble broke out over the selection of the new president of the Congress between the moderate and the radical sections of the party. The party split into the radicals faction, led by Tilak, Pal and Lajpat Rai, and the moderate faction. Nationalists like Aurobindo Ghose, V. O. Chidambaram Pillai were Tilak supporters.

When asked in Calcutta whether he envisioned a Maratha-type of government for independent India, Tilak answered that the Maratha-dominated governments of 17th and 18th centuries were outmoded in the 20th century, and he wanted a genuine federal system for Free India where everyone was an equal partner. He added that only such a form of government would be able to safeguard India&#x27;s freedom. He was the first Congress leader to suggest that Hindi written in the Devanagari script be accepted as the sole national language of India.

===Sedition Charges===
During his lifetime among other political cases, Tilak had been tried for sedition charges in three times by British India Government—in 1897, 1909, and 1916. In 1897, Tilak was sentenced to 18 months in prison for preaching disaffection against the Raj. In 1909, he was again charged with sedition and intensifying racial animosity between Indians and the British. The Bombay lawyer Muhammad Ali Jinnah appeared in Tilak&#x27;s defence but he was sentenced to six years in prison in Burma in a controversial judgement. In 1916 when for the third time Tilak was charged for sedition over his lectures on self-rule, Jinnah again was his lawyer and this time led him to acquittal in the case.

===Imprisonment in Mandalay===

On 30 April 1908, two Bengali youths, Prafulla Chaki and Khudiram Bose, threw a bomb on a carriage at Muzzafarpur, to kill the Chief Presidency Magistrate Douglas Kingsford of Calcutta fame, but erroneously killed two women traveling in it. Chaki committed suicide when caught, and Bose was hanged. Tilak, in his paper &quot;Kesari&quot;, defended the revolutionaries and called for immediate Swaraj or self-rule. The Government swiftly charged him with sedition. At the conclusion of the trial, a special jury convicted him by 7:2 majority. The judge, Dinshaw D. Davar gave him a six years jail sentence to be served in Mandalay, Burma and a fine of . On being asked by the judge whether he had anything to say, Tilak said:All that I wish to say is that, in spite of the verdict of the jury, I still maintain that I am innocent. There are higher powers that rule the destinies of men and nations; and I think, it may be the will of Providence that the cause I represent may be benefited more by my suffering than by my pen and tongue.

Muhammad Ali Jinnah was his lawyer in the case. Justice Davar&#x27;s judgement came under stern criticism in press and was seen against impartiality of British justice system. Justice Davar himself previously had appeared for Tilak in his first sedition case in 1897. In passing sentence, the judge indulged in some scathing strictures against Tilak&#x27;s conduct. He threw off the judicial restraint which, to some extent, was observable in his charge to the jury. He condemned the articles as &quot;seething with sedition&quot;, as preaching violence, speaking of murders with approval. &quot;You hail the advent of the bomb in India as if something had come to India for its good. I say, such journalism is a curse to the country&quot;. Tilak was sent to Mandalay from 1908 to 1914. While imprisoned, he continued to read and write, further developing his ideas on the Indian nationalist movement. While in the prison he wrote the &quot;Gita Rahasya&quot;. Many copies of which were sold, and the money was donated for the Indian Independence movement.

===Life after Mandalay===
Tilak developed diabetes during his sentence in Mandalay prison. This and the general ordeal of prison life had mellowed him at his release on 16 June 1914. When World War I started in August of that year, Tilak cabled the King-Emperor George V of his support and turned his oratory to find new recruits for war efforts. He welcomed The Indian Councils Act, popularly known as Minto-Morley Reforms, which had been passed by British Parliament in May 1909, terming it as &quot;a marked increase of confidence between the Rulers and the Ruled&quot;. It was his conviction that acts of violence actually diminished, rather than hastening, the pace of political reforms. He was eager for reconciliation with Congress and had abandoned his demand for direct action and settled for agitations &quot;strictly by constitutional means&quot; – a line that had long been advocated by his rival Gokhale. Tilak reunited with his fellow nationalists and rejoined the Indian National Congress during the Lucknow pact 1916. .

Tilak tried to convince Mohandas Gandhi to leave the idea of Total non-violence (&quot;Total Ahimsa&quot;) and try to get self-rule (&quot;Swarajya&quot;) by all means. Though Gandhi did not entirely concur with Tilak on the means to achieve self-rule and was steadfast in his advocacy of &quot;satyagraha&quot;, he appreciated Tilak&#x27;s services to the country and his courage of conviction. After Tilak lost a civil suit against Valentine Chirol and incurred pecuniary loss, Gandhi even called upon Indians to contribute to the Tilak Purse Fund started with the objective of defraying the expenses incurred by Tilak.

===All India Home Rule League===

Tilak helped found the All India Home Rule League in 1916–18, with G. S. Khaparde and Annie Besant. After years of trying to reunite the moderate and radical factions, he gave up and focused on the Home Rule League, which sought self-rule. Tilak travelled from village to village for support from farmers and locals to join the movement towards self-rule. Tilak was impressed by the Russian Revolution, and expressed his admiration for Vladimir Lenin. The league had 1400 members in April 1916, and by 1917 membership had grown to approximately 32,000. Tilak started his Home Rule League in Maharashtra, Central Provinces, and Karnataka and Berar region. Besant&#x27;s League was active in the rest of India.

==Thoughts and views==
===Religio-Political Views===
Tilak sought to unite the Indian population for mass political action throughout his life. For this to happen, he believed there needed to be a comprehensive justification for anti-British pro-Hindu activism. For this end, he sought justification in the supposed original principles of the Ramayana and the Bhagavad Gita. He named this call to activism karma-yoga or the yoga of action. In his interpretation, the Bhagavad Gita reveals this principle in the conversation between Krishna and Arjuna when Krishna exhorts Arjuna to fight his enemies (which in this case included many members of his family) because it is his duty. In Tilak&#x27;s opinion, the Bhagavad Gita provided a strong justification of activism. However, this conflicted with the mainstream exegesis of the text at the time which was dominated by renunciate views and the idea of acts purely for God. This was represented by the two mainstream views at the time by Ramanuja and Adi Shankara. To find support for this philosophy, Tilak wrote his own interpretations of the relevant passages of the Gita and backed his views using Jnanadeva&#x27;s commentary on the Gita, Ramanuja&#x27;s critical commentary and his own translation of the Gita. 

===Social views against women===
Tilak was strongly opposed to liberal trends emerging in Pune such as women&#x27;s rights and social reforms against untouchability. Tilak vehemently opposed the establishment of the first Native girls High school (now called Huzurpaga) in Pune in 1885 and its curriculum using his newspapers, the Mahratta and Kesari. Tilak was also opposed to intercaste marriage, particularly the match where an upper caste woman married a lower caste man. In the case of Deshasthas, Chitpawans and Karhades, he encouraged these three Maharashtrian Brahmin groups to give up &quot;caste exclusiveness&quot; and intermarry. Tilak officially opposed the age of consent bill which raised the age of marriage from ten to twelve for girls, however he was willing to sign a circular that increased age of marriage for girls to sixteen and twenty for boys.

Child bride Rukhmabai was married at the age of eleven but refused to go and live with her husband. The husband sued for restitution of conjugal rights, initially lost but appealed the decision. On 4 March 1887, Justice Farran, using interpretations of Hindu laws, ordered Rukhmabai to &quot;go live with her husband or face six months of imprisonment&quot;. Tilak approved of this decision of the court and said that the court was following Hindu Dharmaśāstras. Rukhmabai responded that she would rather face imprisonment than obey the verdict. Her marriage was later dissolved by Queen Victoria. Later, she went on to receive her Doctor of Medicine degree from the London School of Medicine for Women.

In 1890, when an eleven-year-old Phulamani Bai died while having sexual intercourse with her much older husband, the Parsi social reformer Behramji Malabari supported the Age of Consent Act, 1891 to raise the age of a girl&#x27;s eligibility for marriage. Tilak opposed the Bill and said that the Parsis as well as the English had no jurisdiction over the (Hindu) religious matters. He blamed the girl for having &quot;defective female organs&quot; and questioned how the husband could be &quot;persecuted diabolically for doing a harmless act&quot;. He called the girl one of those &quot;dangerous freaks of nature&quot;. Tilak did not have a progressive view when it came to gender relations. He did not believe that Hindu women should get a modern education. Rather, he had a more conservative view, believing that women were meant to be homemakers who had to subordinate themselves to the needs of their husbands and children. Tilak refused to sign a petition for the abolition of untouchability in 1918, two years before his death, although he had spoken against it earlier in a meeting.

===Esteem for Swami Vivekananda===
Tilak and Swami Vivekananda had great mutual respect and esteem for each other. They met accidentally while travelling by train in 1892 and Tilak had Vivekananda as a guest in his house. A person who was present there(Basukaka), heard that it was agreed between Vivekananda and Tilak that Tilak would work towards nationalism in the &quot;political&quot; arena, while Vivekananda would work for nationalism in the &quot;religious&quot; arena. When Vivekananda died at a young age, Tilak expressed great sorrow and paid tributes to him in the Kesari. Tilak said about Vivekananda: 

===Caste issues===
Shahu, the ruler of the princely state of Kolhapur, had several conflicts with Tilak as the latter agreed with the Brahmins decision of Puranic rituals for the Marathas that were intended for Shudras. Tilak even suggested that the Marathas should be &quot;content&quot; with the Shudra status assigned to them by the Brahmins. Tilak&#x27;s newspapers, as well as the press in Kolhapur, criticized Shahu for his caste prejudice and his unreasoned hostility towards Brahmins. These included serious allegations such as sexual assaults by Shahu against four Brahmin women. An English woman named Lady Minto was petitioned to help them. The agent of Shahu had blamed these allegations on the &quot;troublesome brahmins&quot;. Tilak and another Brahmin suffered from the confiscation of estates by Shahu, the first during a quarrel between Shahu and the Shankaracharya of Sankareshwar and later in another issue.

Bal Gangadhar Tilak was released from prison on 16 June 1914. He commented: 

==Social contributions==
Tilak started two weeklies, &quot;Kesari&quot; (&quot;The Lion&quot;) in Marathi and &quot;Mahratta&quot; in English (sometimes referred as &#x27;Maratha&#x27; in Academic Study Books) in 1880–1881 with Gopal Ganesh Agarkar as the first editor. By this he was recognized as &#x27;awakener of India&#x27;, as Kesari later became a daily and continues publication to this day. In 1894, Tilak transformed the household worshipping of Ganesha into a grand public event (Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav). The celebrations consisted of several days of processions, music, and food. They were organized by the means of subscriptions by neighbourhood, caste, or occupation. Students often would celebrate Hindu and national glory and address political issues; including patronage of &quot;Swadeshi&quot; goods. In 1895, Tilak founded the Shri Shivaji Fund Committee for the celebration of &quot;Shiv Jayanti&quot;, the birth anniversary of Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha Empire. The project also had the objective of funding the reconstruction of the tomb (Samadhi) of Shivaji at Raigad Fort. For this second objective, Tilak established the Shri Shivaji Raigad Smarak Mandal along with Senapati Khanderao Dabhade II of Talegaon Dabhade, who became the founder President of the Mandal.

The events like the Ganapati festival and Shiv Jayanti were used by Tilak to build a national spirit beyond the circle of the educated elite in opposition to colonial rule. But it also exacerbated Hindu-Muslim differences. The festival organizers would urge Hindus to protect cows and boycott the Muharram celebrations organized by Shi&#x27;a Muslims, in which Hindus had formerly often participated. Thus, although the celebrations were meant to be a way to oppose colonial rule, they also contributed to religious tensions. Contemporary Marathi Hindu nationalist parties like the Shiv Sena took up his reverence for Shivaji. However, Indian Historian, Uma Chakravarti cites Professor Gordon Johnson and states &quot;It is significant that even at the time when Tilak was making political use of Shivaji the question of conceding Kshatriya status to him as Maratha was resisted by the conservative Brahmins including Tilak. While Shivaji was a Brave man, all his bravery, it was argued, did not give him the right to a status that very nearly approached that of a Brahmin. Further, the fact that Shivaji worshiped the Brahmanas in no way altered social relations, &#x27;since it was as a Shudra he did it – as a Shudra the servant, if not the slave, of the Brahmin&#x27;&quot;.

The Deccan Education Society that Tilak founded with others in the 1880s still runs Institutions in Pune like the Fergusson College. The Swadeshi movement started by Tilak at the beginning of the 20th century became part of the Independence movement until that goal was achieved in 1947. One can even say Swadeshi remained part of Indian Government policy until the 1990s when the Congress Government liberalised the economy. Tilak said, &quot;I regard India as my Motherland and my Goddess, the people in India are my kith and kin, and loyal and steadfast work for their political and social emancipation is my highest religion and duty&quot;.

He commented:

==Books==
In 1903, Tilak wrote the book &quot;The Arctic Home in the Vedas&quot;. In it, he argued that the Vedas could only have been composed in the Arctics, and the Aryan bards brought them south after the onset of the last ice age. He proposed a new way to determine the exact time of the Vedas. In &quot;The Orion&quot;, he tried to calculate the time of the Vedas by using the position of different Nakshatras. The positions of the Nakshtras were described in different Vedas. Tilak wrote &quot;Shrimadh Bhagvad Gita Rahasya&quot; in prison at Mandalay – the analysis of &quot;Karma Yoga&quot; in the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, which is known to be a gift of the Vedas and the &quot;Upanishads&quot;.
=== Translation ===
Two books by B.G. Tilak were translated and published in French in 1979 and 1989 :
* &quot;The Arctic Home in the Vedas&quot;
* &quot;The Orion&quot;
 (This second title was published in French after &quot;L&#x27;Origine Polaire de la Tradition védique (the translation of Tilak&#x27;s work &quot;The Arctic Home in the Vedas&quot;), but is in fact the introduction to it, as confirmed by the original English editions).

==Descendants==
Tilak&#x27;s son, Shridhar Tilak campaigned for removal of untouchability in late 1920s with dalit leader, Dr. Ambedkar. Both were leaders of the multi-caste Samata sangh. He was inspired by his philosophy and social reforms and communicated and discuss with him in methods to get rid of upper-cast hegemony. Given his liberal and rational thoughts, Shridhar Tilak was subjected to a lot of harassment by conservatives in Maharashtra region of that period. Unable to tolerate it, he committed suicide on 25 May 1928. Before that he sent three suicide notes: one to the collector of Pune, another to newspapers and a third one to Dr. Ambedkar. Later Dr. Ambedkar wrote – “If anyone who is worthy of the title Lokamanya, it is Shridharpant Tilak.”

Shridhar&#x27;s son, Jayantrao Tilak (1921–2001) was editor of the Kesari newspaper for many years. Jayantrao was also a politician from the Congress party. He was a member of the Parliament of India representing Maharashtra in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament. He was also a member of the Maharashtra Legislative Council.

Rohit Tilak, a descendant of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, is a Pune-based Congress party politician. In 2017, a woman with whom he had an extra-marital affair accused him of rape and other crimes. He was released on bail in connection with these charges.

==Legacy==

On 28 July 1956, a portrait of B. G. Tilak was put in the Central Hall of Parliament House, New Delhi. The portrait of Tilak, painted by Gopal Deuskar, was unveiled by the then Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru.

Tilak Smarak Ranga Mandir, a theatre auditorium in Pune is dedicated to him. In 2007, the Government of India released a coin to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Tilak. The formal approval of the government of Burma was received for the construction of clafs-cum-lecture hall in the Mandalay prison as a memorial to Lokmanya Tilak. were given by the Indian Government and by the local Indian community in Burma. In 1920, the Lokmanya Tilak Smarak Trust was founded. Between 1995 and 2004, the trust installed several commemorative plaques across Pune under their Pune Aitihasik Vastu Smriti society.

Several Indian films have been made on his life, including: the documentary films &quot;Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak&quot; (1951) and &quot;Lokmanya Tilak&quot; (1957) both by Vishram Bedekar, &quot;&quot; (2015) by Om Raut, and &quot;The Great Freedom Fighter Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak – Swaraj My Birthright&quot; (2018) by Vinay Dhumale. &quot;Lokmanya&quot;, a Marathi-language television series about him, aired in India in 2022.

Balmohan Vidyamandir, a prominent secondary school in the neighbourhood of Shivaji Park in Mumbai, is jointly named in honour of Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (Bal-Mohan).

<text>Demography () is the statistical study of human populations: their size, composition (e.g., ethnic group, age), and how they change through the interplay of fertility (births), mortality (deaths), and migration.

Demographic analysis examines and measures the dimensions and dynamics of populations; it can cover whole societies or groups defined by criteria such as education, nationality, religion, and ethnicity. Educational institutions usually treat demography as a field of sociology, though there are a number of independent demography departments. These methods have primarily been developed to study human populations, but are extended to a variety of areas where researchers want to know how populations of social actors can change across time through processes of birth, death, and migration. In the context of human biological populations, demographic analysis uses administrative records to develop an independent estimate of the population. Demographic analysis estimates are often considered a reliable standard for judging the accuracy of the census information gathered at any time. In the labor force, demographic analysis is used to estimate sizes and flows of populations of workers; in population ecology the focus is on the birth, death, migration and immigration of individuals in a population of living organisms, alternatively, in social human sciences could involve movement of firms and institutional forms. Demographic analysis is used in a wide variety of contexts. For example, it is often used in business plans, to describe the population connected to the geographic location of the business. Demographic analysis is usually abbreviated as DA. For the 2010 U.S. Census, The U.S. Census Bureau has expanded its DA categories. Also as part of the 2010 U.S. Census, DA now also includes comparative analysis between independent housing estimates, and census address lists at different key time points.

Patient demographics form the core of the data for any medical institution, such as patient and emergency contact information and patient medical record data. They allow for the identification of a patient and their categorization into categories for the purpose of statistical analysis. Patient demographics include: date of birth, gender, date of death, postal code, ethnicity, blood type, emergency contact information, family doctor, insurance provider data, allergies, major diagnoses and major medical history.

Formal demography limits its object of study to the measurement of population processes, while the broader field of social demography or population studies also analyses the relationships between economic, social, institutional, cultural, and biological processes influencing a population.

==History==
Demographic thoughts traced back to antiquity, and were present in many civilisations and cultures, like Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, China and India. Made up of the prefix &quot;&quot; and the suffix &quot;-graphy&quot;, the term &quot;&quot; refers to the overall study of population.

In ancient Greece, this can be found in the writings of Herodotus, Thucydides, Hippocrates, Epicurus, Protagoras, Polus, Plato and Aristotle. In Rome, writers and philosophers like Cicero, Seneca, Pliny the Elder, Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Cato, and Columella also expressed important ideas on this ground.

In the Middle Ages, Christian thinkers devoted much time in refuting the Classical ideas on demography. Important contributors to the field were William of Conches, Bartholomew of Lucca, William of Auvergne, William of Pagula, and Muslim sociologists like Ibn Khaldun.

One of the earliest demographic studies in the modern period was &quot;Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality&quot; (1662) by John Graunt, which contains a primitive form of life table. Among the study&#x27;s findings were that one-third of the children in London died before their sixteenth birthday. Mathematicians, such as Edmond Halley, developed the life table as the basis for life insurance mathematics. Richard Price was credited with the first textbook on life contingencies published in 1771, followed later by Augustus De Morgan, &quot;On the Application of Probabilities to Life Contingencies&quot; (1838).

In 1755, Benjamin Franklin published his essay &quot;Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, etc.&quot;, projecting exponential growth in British colonies. His work influenced Thomas Robert Malthus, who, writing at the end of the 18th century, feared that, if unchecked, population growth would tend to outstrip growth in food production, leading to ever-increasing famine and poverty (see Malthusian catastrophe). Malthus is seen as the intellectual father of ideas of overpopulation and the limits to growth. Later, more sophisticated and realistic models were presented by Benjamin Gompertz and Verhulst.

In 1855, a Belgian scholar Achille Guillard defined demography as the natural and social history of human species or the mathematical knowledge of populations, of their general changes, and of their physical, civil, intellectual, and moral condition.

The period 1860–1910 can be characterized as a period of transition where in demography emerged from statistics as a separate field of interest. This period included a panoply of international &#x27;great demographers&#x27; like Adolphe Quetelet (1796–1874), William Farr (1807–1883), Louis-Adolphe Bertillon (1821–1883) and his son Jacques (1851–1922), Joseph Körösi (1844–1906), Anders Nicolas Kaier (1838–1919), Richard Böckh (1824–1907), Émile Durkheim (1858–1917), Wilhelm Lexis (1837–1914), and Luigi Bodio (1840–1920) contributed to the development of demography and to the toolkit of methods and techniques of demographic analysis.

==Methods==

Demography is the statistical and mathematical study of the size, composition, and spatial distribution of human populations and how these features change over time. Data are obtained from a census of the population and from registries: records of events like birth, deaths, migrations, marriages, divorces, diseases, and employment. To do this, there needs to be an understanding of how they are calculated and the questions they answer which are included in these four concepts: population change, standardization of population numbers, the demographic bookkeeping equation, and population composition.

There are two types of data collection—direct and indirect—with several methods of each type.

=== Direct methods ===
Direct data comes from vital statistics registries that track all births and deaths as well as certain changes in legal status such as marriage, divorce, and migration (registration of place of residence). In developed countries with good registration systems (such as the United States and much of Europe), registry statistics are the best method for estimating the number of births and deaths.

A census is the other common direct method of collecting demographic data. A census is usually conducted by a national government and attempts to enumerate every person in a country. In contrast to vital statistics data, which are typically collected continuously and summarized on an annual basis, censuses typically occur only every 10 years or so, and thus are not usually the best source of data on births and deaths. Analyses are conducted after a census to estimate how much over or undercounting took place. These compare the sex ratios from the census data to those estimated from natural values and mortality data.

Censuses do more than just count people. They typically collect information about families or households in addition to individual characteristics such as age, sex, marital status, literacy/education, employment status, and occupation, and geographical location. They may also collect data on migration (or place of birth or of previous residence), language, religion, nationality (or ethnicity or race), and citizenship. In countries in which the vital registration system may be incomplete, the censuses are also used as a direct source of information about fertility and mortality; for example, the censuses of the People&#x27;s Republic of China gather information on births and deaths that occurred in the 18 months immediately preceding the census.

=== Indirect methods ===
Indirect methods of collecting data are required in countries and periods where full data are not available, such as is the case in much of the developing world, and most of historical demography. One of these techniques in contemporary demography is the sister method, where survey researchers ask women how many of their sisters have died or had children and at what age. With these surveys, researchers can then indirectly estimate birth or death rates for the entire population. Other indirect methods in contemporary demography include asking people about siblings, parents, and children. Other indirect methods are necessary in historical demography.

There are a variety of demographic methods for modelling population processes. They include models of mortality (including the life table, Gompertz models, hazards models, Cox proportional hazards models, multiple decrement life tables, Brass relational logits), fertility (Hermes model, Coale-Trussell models, parity progression ratios), marriage (Singulate Mean at Marriage, Page model), disability (Sullivan&#x27;s method, multistate life tables), population projections (Lee-Carter model, the Leslie Matrix), and population momentum (Keyfitz).

The United Kingdom has a series of four national birth cohort studies, the first three spaced apart by 12 years: the 1946 National Survey of Health and Development, the 1958 National Child Development Study, the 1970 British Cohort Study, and the Millennium Cohort Study, begun much more recently in 2000. These have followed the lives of samples of people (typically beginning with around 17,000 in each study) for many years, and are still continuing. As the samples have been drawn in a nationally representative way, inferences can be drawn from these studies about the differences between four distinct generations of British people in terms of their health, education, attitudes, childbearing and employment patterns.

Indirect standardization is used when a population is small enough that the number of events (births, deaths, etc.) are also small. In this case, methods must be used to produce a standardized mortality rate (SMR) or standardized incidence rate (SIR).

==Population change==
Population change is analyzed by measuring the change between one population size to another. Global population continues to rise, which makes population change an essential component to demographics. This is calculated by taking one population size minus the population size in an earlier census. The best way of measuring population change is using the intercensal percentage change. The intercensal percentage change is the absolute change in population between the censuses divided by the population size in the earlier census. Next, multiply this a hundredfold to receive a percentage. When this statistic is achieved, the population growth between two or more nations that differ in size, can be accurately measured and examined.

==Standardization of population numbers==
For there to be a significant comparison, numbers must be altered for the size of the population that is under study. For example, the fertility rate is calculated as the ratio of the number of births to women of childbearing age to the total number of women in this age range. If these adjustments were not made, we would not know if a nation with a higher rate of births or deaths has a population with more women of childbearing age or more births per eligible woman.

Within the category of standardization, there are two major approaches: direct standardization and indirect standardization.

==Common rates and ratios==
* The crude birth rate, the annual number of live births per 1,000 people.
* The general fertility rate, the annual number of live births per 1,000 women of childbearing age (often taken to be from 15 to 49 years old, but sometimes from 15 to 44).
* The age-specific fertility rates, the annual number of live births per 1,000 women in particular age groups (usually age 15–19, 20–24 etc.)
* The crude death rate, the annual number of deaths per 1,000 people.
* The infant mortality rate, the annual number of deaths of children less than 1 year old per 1,000 live births.
* The expectation of life (or life expectancy), the number of years that an individual at a given age could expect to live at present mortality levels.
* The total fertility rate, the number of live births per woman completing her reproductive life, if her childbearing at each age reflected current age-specific fertility rates.
* The replacement level fertility, the average number of children women must have in order to replace the population for the next generation. For example, the replacement level fertility in the US is 2.11.
* The gross reproduction rate, the number of daughters who would be born to a woman completing her reproductive life at current age-specific fertility rates.
* The net reproduction ratio is the expected number of daughters, per newborn prospective mother, who may or may not survive to and through the ages of childbearing.
* A stable population, one that has had constant crude birth and death rates for such a long period of time that the percentage of people in every age class remains constant, or equivalently, the population pyramid has an unchanging structure.
* A stationary population, one that is both stable and unchanging in size (the difference between crude birth rate and crude death rate is zero).
* Measures of centralisation are concerned with the extent to which an area&#x27;s population is concentrated in its urban centres.

A stable population does not necessarily remain fixed in size. It can be expanding or shrinking.

The crude death rate as defined above and applied to a whole population can give a misleading impression. For example, the number of deaths per 1,000 people can be higher in developed nations than in less-developed countries, despite standards of health being better in developed countries. This is because developed countries have proportionally more older people, who are more likely to die in a given year, so that the overall mortality rate can be higher even if the mortality rate at any given age is lower. A more complete picture of mortality is given by a life table, which summarizes mortality separately at each age. A life table is necessary to give a good estimate of life expectancy.

==Basic equation regarding development of a population==
Suppose that a country (or other entity) contains &quot;Populationt&quot; persons at time &quot;t&quot;.
What is the size of the population at time &quot;t&quot; + 1 ?

:formula_1

Natural increase from time &quot;t&quot; to &quot;t&quot; + 1:

:formula_2

Net migration from time &quot;t&quot; to &quot;t&quot; + 1:

:formula_3

These basic equations can also be applied to subpopulations. For example, the population size of ethnic groups or nationalities within a given society or country is subject to the same sources of change. When dealing with ethnic groups, however, &quot;net migration&quot; might have to be subdivided into physical migration and ethnic reidentification (assimilation). Individuals who change their ethnic self-labels or whose ethnic classification in government statistics changes over time may be thought of as migrating or moving from one population subcategory to another.

More generally, while the basic demographic equation holds true by definition, in practice the recording and counting of events (births, deaths, immigration, emigration) and the enumeration of the total population size are subject to error. So allowance needs to be made for error in the underlying statistics when any accounting of population size or change is made.

The figure in this section shows the latest (2004) UN (United Nations) WHO projections of world population out to the year 2150 (red = high, orange = medium, green = low). The UN &quot;medium&quot; projection shows world population reaching an approximate equilibrium at 9 billion by 2075. Working independently, demographers at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria expect world population to peak at 9 billion by 2070. Throughout the 21st century, the average age of the population is likely to continue to rise.

===Science of population===
Populations can change through three processes: fertility, mortality, and migration. Fertility involves the number of children that women have and is to be contrasted with fecundity (a woman&#x27;s childbearing potential). Mortality is the study of the causes, consequences, and measurement of processes affecting death to members of the population. Demographers most commonly study mortality using the life table, a statistical device that provides information about the mortality conditions (most notably the life expectancy) in the population.

Migration refers to the movement of persons from a locality of origin to a destination place across some predefined, political boundary. Migration researchers do not designate movements &#x27;migrations&#x27; unless they are somewhat permanent. Thus, demographers do not consider tourists and travellers to be migrating. While demographers who study migration typically do so through census data on place of residence, indirect sources of data including tax forms and labour force surveys are also important.

Demography is today widely taught in many universities across the world, attracting students with initial training in social sciences, statistics or health studies. Being at the crossroads of several disciplines such as sociology, economics, epidemiology, geography, anthropology and history, demography offers tools to approach a large range of population issues by combining a more technical quantitative approach that represents the core of the discipline with many other methods borrowed from social or other sciences. Demographic research is conducted in universities, in research institutes, as well as in statistical departments and in several international agencies. Population institutions are part of the CICRED (International Committee for Coordination of Demographic Research) network while most individual scientists engaged in demographic research are members of the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population, or a national association such as the Population Association of America in the United States, or affiliates of the Federation of Canadian Demographers in Canada.

==Population composition==

Population composition is the description of population defined by characteristics such as age, race, sex or marital status. These descriptions can be necessary for understanding the social dynamics from historical and comparative research. This data is often compared using a population pyramid.

Population composition is also a very important part of historical research. Information ranging back hundreds of years is not always worthwhile, because the numbers of people for which data are available may not provide the information that is important (such as population size). Lack of information on the original data-collection procedures may prevent accurate evaluation of data quality.

==Demographic analysis in institutions and organizations==

===Labor market===
The demographic analysis of labor markets can be used to show slow population growth, population ageing, and the increased importance of immigration. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that in the next 100 years, the United States will face some dramatic demographic changes. The population is expected to grow more slowly and age more rapidly than ever before and the nation will become a nation of immigrants. This influx is projected to rise over the next century as new immigrants and their children will account for over half the U.S. population. These demographic shifts could ignite major adjustments in the economy, more specifically, in labor markets.

===Turnover and in internal labor markets===
People decide to exit organizations for many reasons, such as, better jobs, dissatisfaction, and concerns within the family. The causes of turnover can be split into two separate factors, one linked with the culture of the organization, and the other relating to all other factors. People who do not fully accept a culture might leave voluntarily. Or, some individuals might leave because they fail to fit in and fail to change within a particular organization.

===Population ecology of organizations===

A basic definition of population ecology is a study of the distribution and abundance of organisms. As it relates to organizations and demography, organizations go through various liabilities to their continued survival. Hospitals, like all other large and complex organizations are impacted in the environment they work. For example, a study was done on the closure of acute care hospitals in Florida between a particular time. The study examined effect size, age, and niche density of these particular hospitals. A population theory says that organizational outcomes are mostly determined by environmental factors. Among several factors of the theory, there are four that apply to the hospital closure example: size, age, density of niches in which organizations operate, and density of niches in which organizations are established.

====Business organizations====
Problems in which demographers may be called upon to assist business organizations are when determining the best prospective location in an area of a branch store or service outlet, predicting the demand for a new product, and to analyze certain dynamics of a company&#x27;s workforce. Choosing a new location for a branch of a bank, choosing the area in which to start a new supermarket, consulting a bank loan officer that a particular location would be a beneficial site to start a car wash, and determining what shopping area would be best to buy and be redeveloped in metropolis area are types of problems in which demographers can be called upon.

Standardization is a useful demographic technique used in the analysis of a business. It can be used as an interpretive and analytic tool for the comparison of different markets.

====Nonprofit organizations====
These organizations have interests about the number and characteristics of their clients so they can maximize the sale of their products, their outlook on their influence, or the ends of their power, services, and beneficial works.

<text>Krishnachandra Bhattacharyya, commonly referred to as K.C. Bhattacharyya, (12 May 1875 – 11 December 1949), was a modern Indian philosopher affiliated with the University of Calcutta. He gained renown for his method of &quot;constructive interpretation,&quot; a scholarly approach employed to elucidate and elaborate upon the interrelationships and intricacies inherent in ancient Indian philosophical systems. This method facilitated an examination of these systems akin to the scrutiny applied to contemporary philosophical problems. Bhattacharyya dedicated particular attention to the inquiry into the manner in which the mind (or consciousness) engenders what appears to be a material universe. Notably, Bhattacharyya advocated for an immersive cosmopolitanism, wherein Indian philosophical frameworks were contemporized through a process of assimilation and immersion, eschewing a mere replication of European ideas in favour of a more nuanced integration.

==Early life==
Bhattacharyya, born on 12 May 1875 in Serampore into a family distinguished for its Sanskrit scholarship, received his early education in a local school. Subsequently, having successfully completed the matriculation examination in 1891, he matriculated to the Presidency College, an institution then associated with the University of Calcutta.

It is noteworthy that Bhattacharya was the father of Kalidas Bhattacharyya, a prominent philosopher.

== Swaraj in Ideas ==
During a period marked by escalating demands for India&#x27;s political emancipation from British colonial dominance, Bhattacharyya articulated a fervent appeal for liberation from what he termed &quot;cultural subjection&quot; – a subtle and nearly imperceptible form of intellectual servitude. This entreaty is encapsulated in &quot;Svarāj in Ideas,&quot; an oration delivered in Candranagar in October 1931, although it remained unpublished during Bhattacharyya&#x27;s lifetime. In elucidating the concept, Bhattacharyya posits that &quot;cultural subjection is ordinarily of an unconscious character and it implies slavery from the very start... There is cultural subjection only when one&#x27;s traditional cast of ideas and sentiments is superseded without comparison or competition by a new cast representing an alien culture which possesses one like a ghost.&quot;

<doc id="45648" wikidata="Q27244" url="?curid=45648" title="Nightjar">
<text>Nightjars are medium-sized nocturnal or crepuscular birds in the family Caprimulgidae and order Caprimulgiformes, characterised by long wings, short legs, and very short bills. They are sometimes called bugeaters, their primary source of food being insects. Some New World species are called [[nighthawk]]s. The English word &quot;nightjar&quot; originally referred to the European nightjar.

Nightjars are found all around the world, with the exception of Antarctica, and certain island groups such as the Seychelles. They can be found in a variety of habitats, most commonly the open country with some vegetation. They usually nest on the ground, with a habit of resting and roosting on roads.

The subfamilies of nightjars have similar characteristics, including small feet, of little use for walking, and long, pointed wings. Typical nightjars have rictal bristles, longer bills, and softer plumage. The colour of their plumage and their unusual perching habits help conceal them during the day.

==Systematics==

=== Caprimulgiformes ===
Previously, all members of the orders Apodiformes, Aegotheliformes, Nyctibiiformes, Podargiformes, and Steatornithiformes were lumped alongside nightjars in the Caprimulgiformes. In 2021, the International Ornithological Congress redefined the Caprimulgiformes as only applying to nightjars, with potoos, frogmouths, oilbirds, and owlet-nightjars all being reclassified into their own orders. See Strisores for more info about the disputes over the taxonomy of Caprimulgiformes. A phylogenetic analysis found that the extinct family Archaeotrogonidae, known from the Eocene and Oligocene of Europe, are the closest known relatives of nightjars.

=== Caprimulgidae ===
Traditionally, nightjars have been divided into two subfamilies—the Caprimulginae, or typical nightjars with 79 known species, and the Chordeilinae, or nighthawks of the New World, with 10 known species. The groups are similar in most respects, but the typical nightjars have rictal bristles, longer bills, and softer plumage. The underside of the claw of the middle toe is comb-like with serrations. Their soft plumage is cryptically coloured to resemble bark or leaves, and some species, unusual for birds, perch along a branch rather than across it, helping to conceal them during the day. The subfamilies of nightjars have similar characteristics, including small feet, of little use for walking, and long, pointed wings.

The common poorwill, &quot;Phalaenoptilus nuttallii&quot;, is unique as a bird that undergoes a form of hibernation, becoming torpid and with a much reduced body temperature for weeks or months, although other nightjars can enter a state of torpor for shorter periods.

In their pioneering DNA–DNA hybridisation work, Charles Sibley and Jon E. Ahlquist found that the genetic difference between the eared nightjars and the typical nightjars was, in fact, greater than that between the typical nightjars and the nighthawks of the New World. Accordingly, they placed the eared nightjars in a separate family, the Eurostopodidae (9 known species), but the family has not yet been widely adopted.

Subsequent work, both morphological and genetic, has provided support for the separation of the typical and the eared nightjars, and some authorities have adopted this Sibley–Ahlquist recommendation, and also the more far-reaching one to group all the owls (traditionally Strigiformes) together in the Caprimulgiformes. The listing below retains a more orthodox arrangement, but recognises the eared nightjars as a separate group. For more detail and an alternative classification scheme, see Caprimulgiformes and Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy.

==Distribution and habitat==
Nightjars inhabit all continents other than Antarctica, as well as some island groups such as Madagascar, the Seychelles, New Caledonia and the islands of Caribbean. They are not known to live in extremely arid desert regions. Nightjars can occupy all elevations from sea level to , and a number of species are montane specialists. Nightjars occupy a wide range of habitats, from deserts to rainforests but are most common in open country with some vegetation.
The nighthawks are confined to the New World, and the eared nightjars to Asia and Australia.

A number of species undertake migrations, although the secretive nature of the family may account for the incomplete understanding of their migratory habits. Species that live in the far north, such as the European nightjar or the common nighthawk, migrate southward with the onset of winter. Geolocators placed on European nightjars in southern England found they wintered in the south of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Other species make shorter migrations.

==Conservation and status==
Some species of nightjars are threatened with extinction. Road-kills of this species by cars are thought to be a major cause of mortality for many members of the family because of their habit of resting and roosting on roads.

They also usually nest on the ground, laying one or two patterned eggs directly onto bare ground. Nightjars possibly move their eggs and chicks from the nesting site in the event of danger by carrying them in their mouths. This suggestion has been repeated many times in ornithology books, but surveys of nightjar research have found very little evidence to support this idea.

Developing conservation strategies for some species presents a particular challenge in that scientists do not have enough data to determine whether or not a species is endangered due to the difficulty in locating, identifying, and/or categorizing their limited number (e.g. 10,000) known to exist, a good example being the Vaurie&#x27;s nightjar in China&#x27;s south-western Xinjiang Province (as seen only once in-hand). Surveys in the 1970s and 1990s failed to find the species., implying that the species has become extinct, endangered, or found only in a few small areas.

==In history and popular culture==
* Nighthawk as a name has been applied to numerous places, characters, and objects throughout history.
* Nebraska&#x27;s state nickname was once the &quot;Bugeater State&quot; and its people were sometimes called &quot;bugeaters&quot; (presumably named after the common nighthawk). The Nebraska Cornhuskers college athletic teams were also briefly known the Bugeaters, before adopting their current name, also adopted by the state as a whole. A semi-professional soccer team in Nebraska now uses the Bugeaters moniker.
* Nightjars feature prominently in the lyrics of the Elton John/Bernie Taupin song &quot;Come Down in Time&quot;: &quot;While a cluster of nightjars sang some songs out of tune&quot;. Sting, in an interview about this song and about Elton John, said, &quot;It&#x27;s a very beautiful song. ... I love Bernie&#x27;s lyrics ... It is one of those songs you wish you had written...&quot;
* They are also featured prominently in the lyrics of Joanna Newsom&#x27;s bird-heavy fourth album Divers; the opening track &quot;Anecdotes&quot; name-checks four different varieties (Rufous, Whip-poor-will, Star-Spotted and Sickle-Winged) and the final track ends with a repeated radio transmission to the fictional soldier Rufous Nightjar.
* The Welsh name for the nightjar is &quot;Troellwr Mawr&quot;, meaning &quot;big spinner&quot;, referring to its whirling sound (the grass warbler is named &quot;Troellwr Bach&quot;).

<doc id="45651" wikidata="Q156349" url="?curid=45651" title="Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan">
<text>Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (; 5 September 188817 April 1975; natively Radhakrishna) was an Indian politician, philosopher and statesman who served as the President of India from 1962 to 1967. He previously served as the vice president of India from 1952 to 1962. He was the ambassador of India to the Soviet Union from 1949 to 1952. He was also the vice-chancellor of Banaras Hindu University from 1939 to 1948 and the vice-chancellor of Andhra University from 1931 to 1936. Radhakrishnan is considered one of the most influential and distinguished 20th century scholars of comparative religion and philosophy, he held the King George V Chair of Mental and Moral Science at the University of Calcutta from 1921 to 1932 and Spalding Chair of Eastern Religion and Ethics at University of Oxford from 1936 to 1952.

Radhakrishnan&#x27;s philosophy was grounded in Advaita Vedanta, reinterpreting this tradition for a contemporary understanding. He defended Hinduism against what he called &quot;uninformed Western criticism&quot;, contributing to the formation of contemporary Hindu identity. He has been influential in shaping the understanding of Hinduism, in both India and the west, and earned a reputation as a bridge-builder between India and the West.

Radhakrishnan was awarded several high awards during his life, including a knighthood in 1931, the Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award in India, in 1954, and honorary membership of the British Royal Order of Merit in 1963. He was also one of the founders of Helpage India, a non profit organisation for elderly underprivileged in India. Radhakrishnan believed that &quot;teachers should be the best minds in the country&quot;.

==Early life and education ==
Radhakrishnan was born as Sarvepalli Radhakrishnayya in a Telugu Hindu family of Sarvepalli Veeraswami and Sithamma. He was the fourth born of six siblings (five brothers and one sister), in Tiruttani of North Arcot district in the erstwhile Madras Presidency (now in Tiruvallur district of Tamil Nadu). His family hails from Sarvepalli village in Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh. His early years were spent in Thiruttani and Tirupati. His father was a subordinate revenue official in the service of a local &quot;Zamindar&quot; (local landlord). His primary education was at K. V. High School at Thiruttani. In 1896 he moved to the Hermansburg Evangelical Lutheran Mission School in Tirupati and Government High Secondary School, Walajapet.

===Education===
 Radhakrishnan was awarded scholarships throughout his academic life. He joined Voorhees College in Vellore for his high school education. After his F.A. (First of Arts) class, he joined the Madras Christian College (affiliated to the University of Madras) at the age of 16. He graduated from there in 1907, and also finished his master&#x27;s degree from the same college.

Radhakrishnan studied philosophy by chance rather than choice. He had wished to study mathematics. Being a financially constrained student, when a cousin who graduated from the same college passed on his philosophy textbooks to Radhakrishnan, it automatically decided his academics course.

Sarvepalli wrote his bachelor&#x27;s degree thesis on &quot;The Ethics of the Vedanta and its Metaphysical Presuppositions&quot;. It &quot;was intended to be a reply to the charge that the Vedanta system had no room for ethics.&quot; Two of his professors, William Meston and Alfred George Hogg, commended Radhakrishnan&#x27;s dissertation. Radhakrishnan&#x27;s thesis was published when he was only twenty. According to Radhakrishnan himself, the criticism of Hogg and other Christian teachers of Indian culture &quot;disturbed my faith and shook the traditional props on which I leaned.&quot; Radhakrishnan himself describes how, as a student,

This led him to his critical study of Indian philosophy and religion and a lifelong defence of Hinduism against &quot;uninformed Western criticism&quot;. At the same time, Radhakrishnan commended Professor Hogg as &#x27;My distinguished teacher,&#x27; and as &quot;one of the greatest Christian thinkers we had in India.&#x27; Besides, Professor William Skinner, who was acting Principal of the College, gave a testimonial saying &quot;he is one of the best men we have had in the recent years&quot;, which enabled him to get the first job in Presidency College. In reciprocation, Radhakrishnan dedicated one of his early books to William Skinner.

The Spirit of &quot;Abheda&quot;

Radhakrishnan expresses his anguish, against the British critics, in The Ethics of the Vedanta. Here he wrote, &quot;it has become philosophic fashion of the present day to consider the Vedanta system a non-ethical one.&quot; He quotes a German-born philologist and Orientalist, who lived and studied in Britain for most of his life, Max Muller as stating, &quot;The Vedanta philosophy has not neglected the important sphere of ethics; but on the contrary, we find ethics in the beginning, ethics in the middle, and ethics in the end, to say nothing of the fact that minds, so engrossed with divine things as Vedanta philosophers, are not likely to fall victims to the ordinary temptations of the world, the flesh, and other powers.&quot;

Radhakrishnan then explains how this philosophy requires us (people) to look upon all creations as one. As non-different. This is where he introduces &quot;The Spirit of Abheda&quot;. He quotes, &quot;In morals, the individual is enjoined to cultivate a Spirit of &quot;Abheda&quot;, or non-difference.&quot; Thus he mentions how this &quot;naturally leads to the ethics of love and brotherhood&quot;.

&quot;Every other individual is to be regarded as your co-equal, and treated as an end, not a means.&quot;

&quot;The Vedanta requires us to respect human dignity and demands the recognition of man as man.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Radhakrishnan was married to Sivakamu (1893–1956) in May 1903, a distant cousin, at the age of 14, when she was aged 10. As per tradition the marriage was arranged by the family. The couple had five daughters named Padmavati, Rukmini, Sushila, Sundari and Shakuntala. They also had a son named Sarvepalli Gopal who went on to a notable career as a historian. Many of Radhakrishnan&#x27;s family members including his grandchildren and great-grandchildren have pursued a wide range of careers in academia, public policy, medicine, law, banking, business, publishing and other fields across the world. Former India cricketer &amp; NCA director VVS Laxman is his great-grandnephew. Sivakamu died on 26 November 1956. They were married for about 53 years.

==Academic career==

In April 1909, Radhakrishnan was appointed to the Department of Philosophy at the Madras Presidency College. Thereafter, in 1918, he was selected as Professor of Philosophy by the University of Mysore, where he taught at its Maharaja&#x27;s College, Mysore. By that time he had written many articles for journals of repute like &quot;The Quest&quot;, &quot;Journal of Philosophy&quot; and the &quot;International Journal of Ethics&quot;. He also completed his first book, &quot;The Philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore&quot;. He believed Tagore&#x27;s philosophy to be the &quot;genuine manifestation of the Indian spirit&quot;. His second book, &quot;The Reign of Religion in Contemporary Philosophy&quot; was published in 1920.

In 1921 he was appointed as a professor in philosophy to occupy the King George V Chair of Mental and Moral Science at the University of Calcutta. He represented the University of Calcutta at the Congress of the Universities of the British Empire in June 1926 and the International Congress of Philosophy at Harvard University in September 1926. Another important academic event during this period was the invitation to deliver the Hibbert Lecture on the ideals of life which he delivered at Manchester College, Oxford in 1929 and which was subsequently published in book form as &quot;An Idealist View of Life&quot;.

In 1929 Radhakrishnan was invited to take the post vacated by Principal J. Estlin Carpenter at Manchester College. This gave him the opportunity to lecture to the students of the University of Oxford on Comparative Religion. For his services to education he was knighted by George V in the June 1931 Birthday Honours, and formally invested with his honour by the Governor-General of India, the Earl of Willingdon, in April 1932. However, he ceased to use the title after Indian independence, preferring instead his academic title of &#x27;Doctor&#x27;.

He was the vice-chancellor of Andhra University from 1931 to 1936. During his first convocation address, he spoke about his native Andhra as, 
In 1936 Radhakrishnan was named Spalding Professor of Eastern Religion and Ethics at the University of Oxford, and was elected a Fellow of All Souls College. That same year, and again in 1937, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature, although this nomination process, as for all laureates, was not public at the time. Further nominations for the awards continued steadily throughout the 1960s. In 1939 Pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya invited him to succeed him as the Vice-Chancellor of Banaras Hindu University (BHU). He served as its Vice-Chancellor till January 1948.

==Political career==

Radhakrishnan started his political career &quot;rather late in life&quot;, after his successful academic career. His international authority preceded his political career. He was one of those stalwarts who attended Andhra Mahasabha in 1928 where he seconded the idea of renaming Ceded Districts division of Madras Presidency as Rayalaseema. In 1931 he was nominated to the League of Nations Committee for Intellectual Cooperation, where after &quot;in Western eyes he was the recognized Hindu authority on Indian ideas and a persuasive interpreter of the role of Eastern institutions in contemporary society.&quot;

When India became independent in 1947, Radhakrishnan represented India at UNESCO (1946–52) and was later Ambassador of India to the Soviet Union, from 1949 to 1952. He was also elected to the Constituent Assembly of India. Radhakrishnan was elected as the first Vice President of India in 1952, and elected as the second President of India (1962–1967). Radhakrishnan did not have a background in the Congress Party, nor was he active in the Indian independence movement. He was the &quot;politician in shadow&quot;. His motivation lay in his pride of Hindu culture, and the defence of Hinduism against &quot;uninformed Western criticism&quot;. According to the historian Donald Mackenzie Brown,

=== &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Day&quot; ===

When Radhakrishnan became the President of India, some of his students and friends requested him to allow them to celebrate his birthday, on 5 September. He replied,Instead of celebrating my birthday, it would be my proud privilege if September 5th is observed as Teachers&#x27; Day.

His birthday has since been celebrated as Teachers&#x27; Day in India.

===Charity===
Along with G. D. Birla and some other social workers in the pre-independence era, Radhakrishnan formed the Krishnarpan Charity Trust.
== Role in Constituent Assembly ==
He was against State institutions imparting denominational religious instruction as it was against the secular vision of the Indian State.

=== Global policy ===
Along with Albert Einstein, Radhakrishnan, the second president of India and the first vice president of India, was one of the sponsors of the Peoples&#x27; World Convention (PWC), also known as Peoples&#x27; World Constituent Assembly (PWCA), which took place in 1950–51 at Palais Electoral, Geneva, Switzerland.

==Philosophy==
Radhakrishnan tried to bridge eastern and western thought, defending Hinduism against &quot;uninformed Western criticism&quot;, but also incorporating Western philosophical and religious thought.

===Advaita Vedanta===
Radhakrishnan was one of the most prominent spokesmen of Neo-Vedanta. His metaphysics was grounded in Advaita Vedanta, but he reinterpreted Advaita Vedanta for a contemporary understanding. He acknowledged the reality and diversity of the world of experience, which he saw as grounded in and supported by the absolute or Brahman. Radhakrishnan also reinterpreted Shankara&#x27;s notion of &quot;maya&quot;. According to Radhakrishnan, maya is not a strict absolute idealism, but &quot;a subjective misperception of the world as ultimately real.&quot;

===Intuition and religious experience===
&quot;Intuition&quot;, synonymously called &quot;religious experience&quot;, has a central place in Radhakrishnan&#x27;s philosophy as a source of knowledge which is not mediated by conscious thought. His specific interest in experience can be traced back to the works of William James (1842–1910), F. H. Bradley (1846–1924), Henri Bergson (1859–1941), and Friedrich von Hügel (1852–1925), and to Vivekananda (1863–1902), who had a strong influence on Sarvepalli&#x27;s thought. According to Radhakrishnan, intuition is of a self-certifying character (&quot;svatassiddha&quot;), self-evidencing (&quot;svāsaṃvedya&quot;) and self-luminous (&quot;svayam-prakāsa&quot;). In his book &quot;An Idealist View of Life&quot;, he made a case for the importance of intuitive thinking as opposed to purely intellectual forms of thought. According to Radhakrishnan, &quot;intuition&quot; plays a specific role in all kinds of experience.

Radhakrishnan discernes eight sorts of experience:
# Cognitive Experience:
# Sense Experience
# Discursive Reasoning
# Intuitive Apprehension
# Psychic Experience
# Aesthetic Experience
# Ethical Experience
# Religious Experience

===Classification of religions===
For Radhakrishnan, theology and creeds are intellectual formulations, and symbols of religious experience or &quot;religious intuitions&quot;. Radhakrishnan qualified the variety of religions hierarchically according to their apprehension of &quot;religious experience&quot;, giving Advaita Vedanta the highest place:
# The worshippers of the Absolute
# The worshippers of the personal God
# The worshippers of the incarnations like Rama, Kṛiṣhṇa, Buddha
# Those who worship ancestors, deities and sages
# The worshippers of the petty forces and spirits

Radhakrishnan saw Hinduism as a scientific religion based on facts, apprehended via intuition or religious experience. According to Radhakrishnan, &quot;if philosophy of religion is to become scientific, it must become empirical and found itself on religious experience&quot;. He saw this empiricism exemplified in the Vedas:

From his writings collected as The Hindu View of Life, Upton Lectures, Delivered at Manchester College, Oxford, 1926: &quot;Hinduism insists on our working steadily upwards in improving our knowledge of God. The worshippers of the absolute are of the highest rank; second to them are the worshippers of the personal God; then come the worshippers of the incarnations of Rama, Krishna, Buddha; below them are those who worship deities, ancestors, and sages, and lowest of all are the worshippers of petty forces and spirits. The deities of some men are in water (i.e., bathing places), those of the most advanced are in the heavens, those of the children (in religion) are in the images of wood and stone, but the sage finds his God in his deeper self. The man of action finds his God in fire, the man of feeling in the heart, and the feeble minded in the idol, but the strong in spirit find God everywhere&quot;. The seers see the supreme in the self, and not the images.&quot;

To Radhakrishnan, Advaita Vedanta was the best representative of Hinduism, as being grounded in intuition, in contrast to the &quot;intellectually mediated interpretations&quot; of other religions. He objected against charges of &quot;quietism&quot; and &quot;world denial&quot;, instead stressing the need and ethic of social service, giving a modern interpretation of classical terms as &quot;tat-tvam-asi&quot;. According to Radhakrishnan, Vedanta offers the most direct intuitive experience and inner realisation, which makes it the highest form of religion:
Radhakrishnan saw other religions, &quot;including what Dr. S. Radhakrishnan understands as lower forms of Hinduism,&quot; as interpretations of Advaita Vedanta, thereby Hinduising all religions.

Although Radhakrishnan was well-acquainted with western culture and philosophy, he was also critical of them. He stated that Western philosophers, despite all claims to objectivity, were influenced by theological influences of their own culture.

==Influence==

Radhakrishnan was one of world&#x27;s best and most influential twentieth-century scholars of comparative religion and philosophy.

Radhakrishnan&#x27;s defence of the Hindu traditions has been highly influential, both in India and the western world. In India, Radhakrishnan&#x27;s ideas contributed to the formation of India as a nation-state. Radhakrishnan&#x27;s writings contributed to the hegemonic status of Vedanta as &quot;the essential world view of Hinduism&quot;. In the western world, Radhakrishnan&#x27;s interpretations of the Hindu tradition, and his emphasis on &quot;spiritual experience&quot;, made Hinduism more readily accessible for a western audience, and contributed to the influence Hinduism has on modern spirituality:
===Appraisal===
Radhakrishnan has been highly appraised. According to Paul Artur Schillp:

And according to Hawley:
===Criticism and context===
Radhakrishnan&#x27;s ideas have also received criticism and challenges, for their perennialist and universalist claims, and the use of an east–west dichotomy.

====Perennialism====
According to Radhakrishnan, there is not only an underlying &quot;divine unity&quot; from the seers of the Upanishads up to modern Hindus like Tagore and Gandhi, but also &quot;an essential commonality between philosophical and religious traditions from widely disparate cultures.&quot; This is also a major theme in the works of Rene Guenon, the Theosophical Society, and the contemporary popularity of eastern religions in modern spirituality. Since the 1970s, the Perennialist position has been criticised for its essentialism. Social-constructionists give an alternative approach to religious experience, in which such &quot;experiences&quot; are seen as being determined and mediated by cultural determinants:

As Michaels notes:
Rinehart also points out that &quot;perennialist claims notwithstanding, modern Hindu thought is a product of history&quot;, which &quot;has been worked out and expressed in a variety of historical contexts over the preceding two hundreds years.&quot; This is also true for Radhakrishan, who was educated by missionaries and, like other neo-Vedantins, used the prevalent western understanding of India and its culture to present an alternative to the western critique.

====Universalism, communalism and Hindu nationalism====
According to Richard King, the elevation of Vedanta as the essence of Hinduism, and Advaita Vedanta as the &quot;paradigmatic example of the mystical nature of the Hindu religion&quot; by colonial Indologists but also neo-Vedantins served well for the Hindu nationalists, who further popularised this notion of Advaita Vedanta as the pinnacle of Indian religions. It

This &quot;opportunity&quot; has been criticised. According to Sucheta Mazumdar and Vasant Kaiwar,

Rinehart also criticises the inclusivity of Radhakrishnan&#x27;s approach, since it provides &quot;a theological scheme for subsuming religious difference under the aegis of Vedantic truth.&quot; According to Rinehart, the consequence of this line of reasoning is communalism, the idea that &quot;all people belonging to one religion have common economic, social and political interests and these interests are contrary to the interests of those belonging to another religion.&quot; Rinehart notes that Hindu religiosity plays an important role in the nationalist movement, and that &quot;the neo-Hindu discourse is the unintended consequence of the initial moves made by thinkers like Rammohan Roy and Vivekananda.&quot; Yet Rinehart also points out that it is

====Post-colonialism====
Colonialism left deep traces in the hearts and minds of the Indian people, influencing the way they understood and represented themselves. The influences of &quot;colonialist forms of knowledge&quot; can also be found in the works of Radhakrishnan. According to Hawley, Radhakrishnan&#x27;s division between East and West, the East being spiritual and mystical, and the West being rationalist and logical in its forms of knowledge, was constructed during the 18th and 19th centuries. Arguably, these characterisations are &quot;imagined&quot; in the sense that they reflect the philosophical and religious realities of neither &quot;East&#x27; nor West.&quot;

Since the 1990s, the colonial influences on the &#x27;construction&#x27; and &#x27;representation&#x27; of Hinduism have been the topic of debate among scholars of Hinduism. Western Indologists are trying to come to more neutral and better-informed representations of India and its culture, while Indian scholars are trying to establish forms of knowledge and understanding which are grounded in and informed by Indian traditions, instead of being dominated by western forms of knowledge and understanding.

==== Feud with &quot;The Modern Review&quot; ====
Radhakrishnan&#x27;s appointment, as a southerner, to &quot;the most important chair of philosophy in India&quot; in the north, was resented by a number of people from the Bengali intellectual elite, and &quot;The Modern Review&quot;, which was critical of the appointment of non-Bengalis, became the main vehicle of criticism. Soon after his arrival in Calcutta in 1921, Radhakrishnan&#x27;s writings were regularly criticised in &quot;The Modern Review&quot;. When Radhakrishnan published his &quot;Indian Philosophy&quot; in two volumes (1923 and 1927), &quot;The Modern Review&quot; questioned his use of sources, criticising the lack of references to Bengali scholars. Yet, in an editor&#x27;s note, &quot;The Modern Review&quot; acknowledged that &quot;As professor&#x27;s Radhakrishnan&#x27;s book has not been received for review in this Journal, &quot;The Modern Review&quot; is not in a position to form any opinion on it.&quot;

In the January 1929 issue of &quot;The Modern Review&quot;, the Bengali philosopher Jadunath Sinha made the claim that parts of his 1922 doctoral thesis, &quot;Indian Psychology of Perception&quot;, published in 1925, were copied by his teacher Radhakrishnan into the chapter on &quot;The Yoga system of Patanjali&quot; in his book &quot;Indian Philosophy II&quot;, published in 1927. Sinha and Radhakrishnan exchanged several letters in the &quot;Modern Review&quot;, in which Sinha compared parts of his thesis with Radhakrishnan&#x27;s publication, presenting altogether 110 instances of &quot;borrowings.&quot; Radhakrishnan felt compelled to respond, stating that Sinha and he had both used the same classical texts, that his translations were standard translations, and that similarities in translations were therefore unavoidable. He further argued that he was lecturing on the subject before publishing his book, and that his book was ready for publication in 1924, before Sinha&#x27;s thesis was published.

Scholars such as Kuppuswami Sastri, Ganganath Jha, and Nalini Ganguli confirmed that Radhakrishnan was distributing the notes in question since 1922. Ramananda Chatterjee, the editor of &quot;The Modern Review&quot;, refused to publish a letter by Nalini Ganguli confirming this fact, while continuing publishing Sinha&#x27;s letters. The General Editor of Radhakrishnan&#x27;s publisher, professor Muirhead, further confirmed that the publication was delayed for three years, due to his stay in the United States.

In Summer 1929, the dispute escalated into a juristic fight. Responding to the alleged &quot;systematic effort [...] to destroy Radhakrishnan&#x27;s reputation as a scholar and a public figure,&quot; Radhakrishnan filed a suit for defamation of character against Sinha and Chatterjee, demanding Rs. 100,000 for the damage done, and Sinha filed a case against Radhakrishnan for copyright infringement, demanding Rs. 20,000. The suits were settled in May 1933, the terms of the settlement were not disclosed, and &quot;all the allegations made in the pleadings and in the columns of the &quot;Modern Review&quot; were withdrawn.&quot;

<text>Ram Mohan Roy (22 May 1772 – 27 September 1833) was an Indian reformer and writer who was one of the founders of the Brahmo Sabha in 1828, the precursor of the Brahmo Samaj, a socio-religious reform movement in the Indian subcontinent. He has been dubbed the &quot;Father of Indian Renaissance.&quot; He was given the title of Raja by Mughal emperor Akbar II (). 

His influence was apparent in the fields of politics, public administration, education and religion. He was known for his efforts to abolish the practices of sati and child marriage. Roy wrote &quot;Gaudiya Vyakaran&quot; which was the first complete Bangla grammar written book.
== Early life (1772–1796)==
Ram Mohan Roy was born in Radhanagar, Hooghly District, Bengal Presidency. His great-grandfather Krishnakanta Bandyopadhyay was a Rarhi Kulin (noble) Brahmin. Among Kulin Brahmins descendants of the five families of Brahmins imported from Kannauj by Ballal Sen in the 12th century as per popular myththose from the Rarhi district of West Bengal were notorious in the 19th century for living off dowries by marrying several women. Kulinism was a synonym for polygamy and the dowry system, both of which Ram Mohan campaigned against. His father, Ramkanta, was a Vaishnavite, while his mother, Tarini Devi, was from a Shaivite family. He was a great scholar of Sanskrit, Persian and English languages and also knew Arabic, Latin and Greek. One parent prepared him for the occupation of a scholar, the &quot;Shastri&quot;, while the other secured for him all the worldly advantages needed to launch a career in the &quot;laukik&quot; or worldly sphere of public administration. Torn between these two parental ideals from early childhood, Ram Mohan vacillated between the two for the rest of his life.

During his childhood Ram Mohan Roy witnessed the death of his sister-in-law through sati. The seventeen-year-old girl was dragged towards the pyre where Ram Mohan Roy witnessed her terrified state. He tried to protest but to no avail. She was burned alive. The people chanted &quot;Maha Sati! Maha Sati! Maha Sati!&quot; (great wife) over her painful screams.

Ram Mohan Roy was married three times. His first wife died early. He had two sons, Radhaprasad in 1800, and Ramaprasad in 1812 with his second wife, who died in 1824. Roy&#x27;s third wife outlived him.

The nature and content of Ram Mohan Roy&#x27;s early education is disputed. One view is that Ram Mohan started his formal education in the village &quot;pathshala&quot; where he learned Bengali and some Sanskrit and Persian. Later he is said to have studied Persian and Arabic in a &quot;madrasa&quot; in Patna and after that he was sent to Benares to learn the intricacies of Sanskrit and Hindu scripture, including the Vedas and Upanishads. The dates of his time in both these places are uncertain. However, it is believed that he was sent to Patna when he was nine years old and two years later he went to Benares.

Ram Mohan Roy&#x27;s impact on modern Indian history was his revival of the pure and ethical principles of the Vedanta school of philosophy as found in the Upanishads. He preached the unity of God, made early translations of Vedic scriptures into English, co-founded the Calcutta Unitarian Society and founded the Brahmo Sabha, precursor to Brahmo Samaj. The Brahmo Samaj played a major role in reforming and modernizing the Indian society. He successfully campaigned against sati, the practice of burning widows. He sought to integrate Western culture with the best features of his own country&#x27;s traditions. He established a number of schools to popularize a modern system of education in India. He promoted a rational, ethical, non-authoritarian, this-worldly views and social reforms in Hinduism. His writings also sparked interest among British and American Unitarians.

== Christianity and the early rule of the East India Company (1795–1828)==
During the early years of East India Company rule, Ram Mohan Roy acted as a political agitator while employed by the company.

In 1792, the British Baptist shoemaker William Carey published his influential missionary tract, &quot;An Enquiry of the Obligations of Christians to Use Means for the Conversion of Heathens&quot;.

In 1793, William Carey landed in India to settle. His objective was to translate, publish and distribute the Bible in Indian languages and propagate Christianity to the Indian people. He realised the &quot;mobile&quot; (i.e. service classes) Brahmins and Pandits were most able to help him in this endeavour, and he began gathering them. He learnt the Buddhist and Jain religious works to better argue the case for Christianity in a cultural context.

In 1795, Carey made contact with a Sanskrit scholar, the Tantric Saihardana Vidyavagish, who later introduced him to Ram Mohan Roy, who wished to learn English.

While there are rumors that between 1796 and 1797, the trio of Carey, Vidyavagish, and Roy created a religious work known as the &quot;Maha Nirvana Tantra&quot; (or &quot;Book of the Great Liberation&quot;). Scholars like John Duncan Derrett are skeptical of this claim calling it &quot;highly improbable&quot; and Hugh Urban argues that &quot;It is probable that we will never know the true author and date of the Maha Nirvana Tantra&quot;. Carey&#x27;s involvement is not recorded in his very detailed records and he reports only learning to read Sanskrit in 1796 and only completed a grammar in 1797, the same year he translated part of The Bible (from Joshua to Job), a massive task. For the next two decades Maha Nirvana Tantra was regularly augmented. Its judicial sections were used in the law courts of the English Settlement in Bengal as Hindu Law for adjudicating upon property disputes of the zamindars. However, a few British magistrates and collectors began to suspect and its usage (as well as the reliance on pandits as sources of Hindu Law) was quickly deprecated. Vidyavagish had a brief falling out with Carey and separated from the group, but maintained ties to Ram Mohan Roy.

In 1797, Raja Ram Mohan reached Calcutta and became a bania (moneylender), mainly to lend to the Englishmen of the Company living beyond their means. Ram Mohan also continued his vocation as pandit in the English courts and started to make a living for himself. He began learning Greek and Latin.

In 1799, Carey was joined by missionary Joshua Marshman and the printer William Ward at the Danish settlement of Serampore.

From 1803 until 1815, Ram Mohan served the East India Company&#x27;s &quot;Writing Service&quot;, commencing as private clerk (&quot;Munshi&quot;) to Thomas Woodroffe, Registrar of the Appellate Court at Murshidabad (whose distant nephew, John Woodroffe—also a magistrate—and later lived off the Maha Nirvana Tantra under the pseudonym Arthur Avalon). Roy resigned from Woodroffe&#x27;s service and later secured employment with John Digby, a Company collector, and Ram Mohan spent many years at Rangpur and elsewhere with Digby, where he renewed his contacts with Hariharananda. William Carey had by this time settled at Serampore and the old trio renewed their profitable association. William Carey was also aligned now with the English Company, then head-quartered at Fort William, and his religious and political ambitions were increasingly intertwined.

While in Murshidabad, in 1804 Raja Ram Mohan Roy wrote &quot;Tuhfat-ul-Muwahhidin&quot; (A Gift to Monotheists) in Persian with an introduction in Arabic. Bengali had not yet become the language of intellectual discourse. The importance of &quot;Tuhfat-ul-muwahhidin&quot; lies only in its being the first known theological statement of one who achieved later fame and notoriety as a Vedantin. On its own, it is unremarkable, perhaps of interest only to a social historian because of its amateurish eclecticism. &quot;Tuhfat&quot; was, after all, available as early as 1884 in the English translation of Maulavi Obaidullah EI Obaid, published by the Adi Brahmo Samaj. Raja Ram Mohan Roy did not know the Upanishad at this stage in his intellectual development.

In 1814, he started Atmiya Sabha (i.e. Society of Friends) a philosophical discussion circle in Kolkata (then Calcutta) to propagate the monotheistic ideals of the vedanta and to campaign against idolatry, caste rigidities, meaningless rituals and other social ills.

The East India Company was draining money from India at a rate of three million pounds a year by 1838. Ram Mohan Roy was one of the first to try to estimate how much money was being taken out of India and to where it was disappearing. He estimated that around one-half of all total revenue collected in India was sent out to England, leaving India, with a considerably larger population, to use the remaining money to maintain social well-being. Ram Mohan Roy saw this and believed that the unrestricted settlement of Europeans in India governing under free trade would help ease the economic drain crisis.

During the next two decades, Ram Mohan along with William Carey, launched his attack against the bastions of Hinduism of Bengal, namely his own Kulin Brahmin priestly clan (then in control of the many temples of Bengal) and their priestly excesses. The Kulin excesses targeted include sati (the co-cremation of widows), polygamy, child marriage and dowry.

From 1819, Ram Mohan&#x27;s battery increasingly turned against William Carey, a Baptist Missionary settled in Serampore, and the Serampore missionaries. With Dwarkanath&#x27;s munificence, he launched a series of attacks against Trinitarian Christianity and was now considerably assisted in his theological debates by the Unitarian faction of Christianity.

He wrote &quot;Gaudiya Vyakaran&quot; which was the first complete Bangla grammar written book. It was published in 1826.

In 1828, he launched Brahmo Sabha with Debendranath Tagore. By 1828, he had become a well known figure in India. In 1830, he had gone to England as an envoy of the Mughal Emperor, Akbar Shah II, who invested him with the title of Raja to the court of King William IV.

==Middle &quot;Brahmo&quot; period (1820–1830)==
This was Ram Mohan&#x27;s most controversial period. Commenting on his published works Sivanath Sastri writes:

&quot;The period between 1820 and 1830 was also eventful from a literary point of view, as will be manifest from the following list of his publications during that period:

:* Second Appeal to the Christian Public, &quot;Brahmanical Magazine&quot; – Parts I, II and III, with Bengali translation and a new Bengali newspaper called Sambad Kaumudi in 1821;
:* A Persian paper called &quot;Mirat-ul-Akbar&quot; contained a tract entitled Brief Remarks on Ancient Female Rights and a book in Bengali called Answers to Four Questions in 1822;
:* Third and final appeal to the Christian public, a memorial to the King of England on the subject of the liberty of the press, Ramdoss papers relating to Christian controversy, &quot;Brahmanical Magazine&quot;, No. IV, letter to Lord Arnherst on the subject of English education, a tract called &quot;Humble Suggestions&quot; and a book in Bengali called &quot;Pathyapradan or Medicine for the Sick,&quot; all in 1823;
:* A letter to Rev. H. Ware on the &quot;Prospects of Christianity in India&quot; and an &quot;Appeal for Famine-smitten Natives in Southern India&quot; in 1824;
:* A tract on the different modes of worship, in 1825;
:* A Bengali tract on the qualifications of a God-loving householder, a tract in Bengali on a controversy with a Kayastha and a grammar of the Bengali language in English in 1826;
:* A Sanskrit tract on &quot;Divine Worship by Gayatri&quot; with an English translation of the same, the edition of a Sanskrit treatise against caste and the previously noticed tract called &quot;Answer of a Hindu to the Question &amp;c.&quot; in 1827;
:* A form of divine worship and a collection of hymns composed by him and his friends, in 1828;
:* &quot;Religious Instructions Founded on Sacred Authorities&quot; in English and Sanskrit, a Bengali tract called &quot;Anusthan&quot;, and a petition against sati, in 1829.

He publicly declared that he would emigrate from the British Empire if Parliament failed to pass the Reform Bill.

In 1830, Ram Mohan Roy travelled to the United Kingdom as an ambassador of the Mughal Empire to ensure that Lord William Bentinck&#x27;s Bengal Sati Regulation, 1829 banning the practice of sati was not overturned. In addition, Roy petitioned the King to increase the Mughal Emperor&#x27;s allowance and perquisites. He was successful in persuading the British government to increase the stipend of the Mughal Emperor by £30,000. While in England, he embarked on cultural exchanges, meeting with members of parliament and publishing books on Indian economics and law. Sophia Dobson Collet was his biographer at that time.

==Religious reforms==
The religious reforms of Roy contained in some beliefs of the Brahmo Samaj expounded by Rajnarayan Basu are:

* Brahmo Samaj believe that the most fundamental doctrines of Brahmoism are at the basis of every religion followed by a man.
* Brahmo Samaj believe in the existence of One Supreme God—&quot;God, endowed with a distinct personality &amp; moral attributes equal to His nature, and intelligence befitting the Author and Preserver of the Universe,&quot; and worship Him alone.
* Brahmo Samaj believe that worship of Him needs no fixed place or time. &quot;We can adore Him at any time and at any place, provided that time and that place are calculated to compose and direct the mind towards Him.&quot;
* All men are children of the &#x27;one God of all human beings&#x27;, and therefore equal.

Having studied the Qur’an, the Vedas and the Upanishads, Roy&#x27;s beliefs were derived from a combination of monastic elements of Hinduism, Islam, eighteenth-century Deism, Unitarianism, and the ideas of the Freemasons.

===Social reforms===
Raja Ram Mohan Roy founded the Atmiya Sabha and the Unitarian Community to fight the social evils, and to propagate social and educational reforms in India. He was the man who fought against superstitions, a pioneer in Indian education, and a trend setter in Bengali prose and Indian press.

* Crusaded against Hindu customs such as sati, polygamy, child marriage and the caste system.
* In 1828, he set up the &quot;Brahmo Sabha&quot;, a movement of reformist Bengali Brahmins to fight against social evils.

Roy&#x27;s political background and Devandra&#x27;s Christian influence influenced his social and religious views regarding reforms of Hinduism. He writes,

The present system of Hindus is not well calculated to promote their political interests… It is necessary that some change should take place in their religion, at least for the sake of their political advantage and social comfort.

Roy&#x27;s experience working with the British government taught him that Hindu traditions were often not credible or respected by western standards and this no doubt affected his religious reforms. He wanted to legitimise Hindu traditions to his European acquaintances by proving that &quot;superstitious practices which deform the Hindu religion have nothing to do with the pure spirit it dictates!&quot; The &quot;superstitious practices&quot;, to which Ram Mohan Roy objected, included sati, caste rigidity, polygamy and child marriages. These practices were often the reasons British officials claimed moral superiority over the Indian nation. Ram Mohan Roy&#x27;s ideas of religion actively sought to create a fair and just society by implementing humanitarian practices similar to the Christian ideals professed by the British and thus seeking to legitimise Hinduism in the eyes of the Christian world.

===Educational reforms===
* Roy believed education to be an implement for social reform.
* In 1822, Roy founded the &quot;Anglo-Hindu School&quot;, followed four years later (1826) by the &quot;Vedanta College&quot;; where he insisted that his teachings of monotheistic doctrines be incorporated with &quot;modern, western curriculum.&quot; 
* In 1830, he helped Rev. Alexander Duff in establishing the General Assembly&#x27;s Institution (now known as Scottish Church College), by providing him with the venue vacated by &quot;Brahma Sabha&quot; and getting the first batch of students.
* He supported induction of Western learning into Indian education.
* He also set up the &quot;Vedanta College&quot;, offering courses as a synthesis of Western and Indian learning.
* His most popular journal was the &quot;Sambad Kaumudi&quot;. It covered topics like freedom of the press, induction of Indians into high ranks of service, and separation of the executive and judiciary.
* When the English East India Company muzzled the press, Ram Mohan composed two memorials against this in 1829 and 1830 respectively.

==Death==
In early September 1833 Roy came to Bristol to visit his Unitarian friend, Dr Lant Carpenter, where he made a deep impression on Lant&#x27;s daughter and future social reformer, Mary Carpenter. While in Bristol Roy preached at the Lewins Mead Meeting House. In mid September he became ill and was diagnosed with meningitis. He died at Stapleton, then a village to the north-east of Bristol (now a suburb), on 27 September 1833 of meningitis or a chronic respiratory ailment.

==Mausoleum at Arnos Vale==

Ram Mohan Roy was originally buried on 18 October 1833, in the grounds of Stapleton Grove, where he had lived as an ambassador of the Mughal Empire and died of meningitis on 27 September 1833. Nine years later he was reburied on 29 May 1843 in a grave at the new Arnos Vale Cemetery, in Brislington, East Bristol. A large plot on The Ceremonial Way there had been bought by William Carr and William Prinsep, and the body in its lac and a lead coffin was placed later in a deep brick-built vault, over seven feet underground. Two years after this, Dwarkanath Tagore helped pay for the chhatri raised above this vault, although there is no record of him ever visiting Bristol. The chhatri was designed by the artist William Prinsep, who had known Ram Mohan in Calcutta.

Bristol Arnos Vale cemetery have been holding remembrance services for Raja Ram Mohan Roy every year on a Sunday close to his death anniversary date of 27 September. The Indian High Commission at London often come to Raja&#x27;s annual commemoration and Bristol&#x27;s Lord Mayor is also regularly in attendance. The commemoration is a joint Brahmo-Unitarian service, in which, prayers and hymns are sung, flowers laid at the tomb, and the life of the Raja is celebrated via talks and visual presentations. In 2013, a recently discovered ivory bust of Ram Mohan was displayed. In 2014, his original death mask at Edinburgh was filmed and its history was discussed. In 2017, Raja&#x27;s commemoration was held on 24 September.

==Legacy==

Roy&#x27;s commitment to English education and thought sparked debate between Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore. Gandhi objected to Roy&#x27;s devotion to English education and thought and disallowing independent thinking by being overly supportive of the Western philosophical discourses. Tagore wrote a letter rejecting Gandhi&#x27;s view, saying &quot;[Roy] had the full inheritance of Indian wisdom. He was never a school boy of the West, and therefore had the dignity to be a friend of the West.&quot;

In 1983, a full-scale Exhibition on Ram Mohan Roy was held in Bristol&#x27;s Museum and Art Gallery. His enormous 1831 portrait by Henry Perronet Briggs still hangs there and was the subject of a talk by Max Muller in 1873. At Bristol&#x27;s centre, on College Green, there is a full-size bronze statue of Raja by a modern Kolkata sculptor Niranjan Pradhan. Another bust by Pradhan, gifted to Bristol by Jyoti Basu, sits inside the main foyer of Bristol&#x27;s City Hall.

A pedestrian path at Stapleton has been named &quot;Rajah Rammohun Walk&quot;. There is a 1933 Brahmo plaque on the outside west wall of Stapleton Grove, and his first burial place in the garden is marked by railings and a granite memorial stone. His tomb and chhatri at Arnos Vale are listed as a Grade II historic site by English Heritage and attract many visitors today.

==In popular culture==
A 1965 Indian Bengali-language film &quot;Raja Rammohan&quot; about Roy&#x27;s reforms, directed by Bijoy Bose and starring Basanta Chowdhury in the title role.

In 1988 Doordarshan Serial Bharat Ek Khoj produced and directed by Shyam Benegal also picturised a full one episode on Raja Ram Mohan Roy. The title role was played by noted TV actor Anang Desai with Urmila Bhatt, Tom Alter and Ravi Jhankal as supporting cast.

In 1984 Films Division of India created a documentary &quot;Raja Rammohan Roy&quot; directed by P. C. Sharma.

In 2004, Roy was ranked number 10 in BBC&#x27;s poll of the Greatest Bengali of All Time.

<text>Dayanand Saraswati () born Mool Shankar Tiwari (12 February 1824 – 30 October 1883), was a Hindu philosopher, social leader and founder of the Arya Samaj, a reform movement of Hinduism. His book &quot;Satyarth Prakash&quot; has remained one of the influential texts on the philosophy of the Vedas and clarifications of various ideas and duties of human beings. He was the first to give the call for &quot;Swaraj&quot; as &quot;India for Indians&quot; in 1876, a call later taken up by Lokmanya Tilak. Denouncing the idolatry and ritualistic worship, he worked towards reviving Vedic ideologies. Subsequently, the philosopher and President of India, S. Radhakrishnan, called him one of the &quot;makers of Modern India&quot;, as did Sri Aurobindo.

Those who were influenced by and followed Dayananda included Chaudhary Charan Singh, Madam Cama, Pandit Lekh Ram, Swami Shraddhanand, Shyamji Krishna Varma, Kishan Singh, Bhagat Singh, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Bhai Parmanand, Lala Hardayal, Madan Lal Dhingra, Ram Prasad Bismil, Mahadev Govind Ranade, Ashfaqullah Khan, Mahatma Hansraj, Lala Lajpat Rai, Yogmaya Neupane, Vallabhbhai Patel and others.

He was a sanyasi (ascetic) from boyhood and a scholar. He believed in the infallible authority of the Vedas. Dayananda advocated the doctrines of karma and reincarnation. He emphasized the Vedic ideals of brahmacharya, including celibacy and devotion to God.

Among Dayananda&#x27;s contributions were his opposition to untouchability, promotion of the equal rights for women and his commentary on the Vedas from Vedic Sanskrit in Sanskrit as well as in Hindi.

== Early life ==

Dayananda Saraswati was born on the 10th day of waning moon in the month of Purnimanta Phalguna (12 February 1824) on the tithi to an Indian Hindu Brahmin family in Tankara, Kathiawad region (now Morbi district of Gujarat). He belonged to the Audichya Brahmin sub-division. His original name was Mool Shankar Tiwari (Trivedi, in its original form), because he was born in Dhanu Rashi and Mul Nakshatra. His father was Karshanji Lalji Trivedi, and his mother was Yashodabai.

When he was eight years old, his Yajnopavita Sanskara ceremony was performed, marking his entry into formal education. His father was a follower of Shiva and taught him the ways to worship Shiva. He was also taught the importance of keeping fasts. On the occasion of Shivratri, Dayananda sat awake the whole night in obedience to Shiva. During one of these fasts, he saw a mouse eating the offerings and running over the idol&#x27;s body. After seeing this, he questioned that if Shiva could not defend himself against a mouse, then how could he be the saviour of the world.

The deaths of his younger sister and his uncle from cholera led Dayananda to ponder the meaning of life and death. He began asking questions which worried his parents. He was engaged in his early teens, but he decided marriage was not for him and ran away from home in 1846.

Dayanand Saraswati spent nearly twenty-five years, from 1845 to 1869, as a wandering ascetic, searching for religious truth. He found out that the joy from material goods was not enough, therefore he decided to devote himself to spiritual pursuits in forests, retreats in the Himalayan Mountains, and pilgrimage sites in northern India. During these years he practised various forms of yoga and became a disciple of a teacher named Virajanand Dandeesha. Virajanand believed that Hinduism had strayed from its historical roots and that many of its practices had become impure. Dayananda Sarasvati promised Virajanand that he would devote his life to restoring the rightful place of the Vedas in the Hindu faith.

== Teachings of Dayananda ==
Maharshi Dayanand advocated that all human beings are equally capable of achieving anything. He said all the creatures are the eternal Praja or citizens of the Supreme Lord. He said the four Vedas which are Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, and Atharvaveda are the only true uncorrupted sources of Dharma, revealed by the Supreme Lord, at the beginning of every creation, also because they are the only perfectly preserved knowledge without alterations using Sanskrit prosody or Chhandas and different techniques of counting the number of verses with different Vedic chanting techniques. He says, that confusion regarding the Vedas arose due to the misinterpretations of the Vedas, and Vedas promote Science and ask Humans to discover the Ultimate Truth, which he has emphasized throughout his Commentary on the Vedas.

He accepted the teachings of the first ten Principal Upanishads also with Shvetashvatara Upanishad, which explains the Adhyatma part of the Vedas. He further said, that any source, including Upanishads, should be considered and accepted to only that extent as they are in conformity with the teachings of the Vedas.

He accepted the 6 Vedanga texts which include grammar and the like required for the correct interpretation of the Vedas. Among Sanskrit grammatical texts, he says, Pāṇini&#x27;s Aṣṭādhyāyī and its commentary, Mahabhashya by Maharshi Patanjali are the current surviving valid texts and all other surviving modern-grammatical texts should not be accepted as they are confusing, dishonest and will not help people in learning the Vedas easily.

He accepted the six Darshana Shastras which includes Samkhya, Vaisheshika, Nyaya, Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, Purva Mimamsa Sutras, Vedanta Sutras. Unlike other medieval Sanskrit scholars, Dayanand said all the six Darshanas are not opponents but each throws light on different aspects required by the Creation. Hence they are all independent in their own right and all of them conform with the teachings of the Vedas. He says Acharya Kapila of Sankhya Darshan was not an atheist but it is the scholars who misinterpreted his sutras.

He said the books called Brahamana-Granthas such as Aitareya Brahmana, Shatapatha Brahmana, Sāma Brahamana, Gopatha Brahmana, etc. which are authored by the seers to explain the meaning of the Vedas are also valid but again only to that extent as they agree with four Vedas because these texts are prone to interpolations by others. He said it is these books which are called by the names &quot;Itihasa, Purana, Narashamsa, Kalpa, Gatha&quot; since they contain information about the life of Seers and incidents, they inform about the creation of the World, etc...

He stated that the eighteen Puranas and the eighteen Upapuranas, are not the authentic Puranas and these are not authored by sage Vyasa, and they violate the teachings of the Vedas and therefore should not be accepted. The eighteen Puranas and Upapuranas are filled with contradictions, idol worship, incarnations and personification of God, temples, rituals, and practices that are against the Vedas. In his book Satyarth Prakash, he says whatever &#x27;good&#x27; is present in these eighteen Puranas and Upapuranas, are already present in the Vedas and since they contain too many false pieces of information that can mislead people, they should be rejected.

He points that the sage Vyasa was called so by the name &quot;Vyasa&quot; not because he divided the Vedas but indicates the &quot;diameter or breadth&quot; which means sage Veda Vyasa had studied the Vedas in great depth.

He lists out various texts that should not be treated as honest texts to develop one&#x27;s understanding of the World and the Lord. He rejected &quot;all&quot; of the Tantric texts including Pancharatra. He said that these texts are not valid as they teach different customs, rituals, and practices which are against the Vedas.

Dayanand based his teachings on the Vedas which can be summarised as follows:
# There are three entities that are eternal: 1. The Supreme Lord or Paramatma, 2. The Individual Souls or Jivatmas, which are vast in number but not infinite, 3. Prakriti or Nature.
# Prakṛti or Nature, which is the material cause of the Creation, is eternal and is characterized by Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas, which tend to be in equilibrium. In every cycle of creation, the conscious Supreme Lord will disturb its equilibrium and make it useful for the creation of the World and its forces and to manufacture the bodies required by the individual souls. After a specific time called the day of the Brahma (Brahma means great, lengthy, etc.), the creation would be dissolved and nature would be restored to its equilibrium. After a period called the Night of Brahma, which is equal to the length of the day of the Brahma, the Creation would set forth again. This cycle of creation and dissolution is eternal.
# Jiva or Jivatma or Individual Eternal Soul or Self, are many who are different from one another yet have similar characteristics and can reach the &#x27;same level&#x27; of Happiness in the state of Moksha or Liberation. They are not made out of Natural particles and are bodiless, beyond all genders and all other characteristics as seen in the World, but they acquire a body made out of Nature and it is known as taking &#x27;birth&#x27;. These souls are subtler than Nature itself but take birth through the body as per the creative principles set by the Supreme Lord based on their past Karma, and they put effort into improving themselves. By realizing oneself, Nature, and the Supreme Lord, Individual Souls are Liberated. But this realization depends on their efforts and knowledge. They keep coming to the World, use Nature, obtain the fruits of their actions, and appear taking myriads of lives of different animals (Those who have attained higher intellectual bodies can also go back to lower forms based on their Karma or actions), they redo their actions, and are free to choose their actions, learn and relearn, attain Liberation. After the long duration of Moksha or Liberation, would come back again into the world. Since this period of Moksha or Liberation is long, it appears as though they never return or they never take birth again, by the other beings who are still in the World. Since they are eternal and capable of working, these characteristics cannot be destroyed. They are timeless, eternal but are not omniscients and hence cannot be the pervaders of entire Space.
# The Supreme Lord who is One without second like him, whose name is Om, is the efficient cause of the Universe. Lord&#x27;s Chief characteristics are - Sat, Chit, and Ananda i.e., &quot;Exists&quot;, has &quot;Supreme Consciousness&quot; and is &quot;Eternally Blissful&quot;. The Lord and his characteristics are the same. The Supreme Lord is ever present everywhere, whose characteristics are beyond Nature or Prakriti, and pervades all the individual souls and the Nature. It is not characteristic of the Supreme Lord to take birth or incarnate. He is ever pure i.e., unmixed by the characteristics of Nature and the individual souls. The Supreme Lord is bodiless, infinite, hence has no form and hence cannot be worshipped through idols but can only be reached by any being through Yogic Samadhi as advocated in the Vedas which is summarised in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. Since the Lord is bodiless and hence beyond all genders, the Vedas address him as Father, Mother, Friend, Cause of the Worlds, Maker, etc... He is the subtlest entity which is subtler than Nature, Pervading and Filling the entire existence and Space. It is due to his subtlety that he could take hold of Nature to create the Worlds and he proposes no difficulty for the motion of the Worlds in Space. Hence he is called Paramatman, which means &#x27;Ultimate Pervader&quot;. There exists neither who is equal to him nor completely opposed to him. The ideas of Satans, Ghosts, etc. are foreign to the Vedas.
# He said the names Agni, Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma, Prajapati, Paramatma, Vishva, Vayu, etc. are the different characteristics of the Supreme Lord, and the meaning of each of the names should be obtained by Dhatupatha or Root. And these names do not refer to any Puranic Deities. Also, certain names may also refer to the worldly elements which should be distinguished from their contexts.
# Regarding the notion of Saguna and Nirguna in explaining the nature of the Lord. Saguna, he says, refers to characteristics of the Lord such as Pervasiveness, Omnipotency, Bliss, Ultimate Consciousness, etc. and, Nirguna, he says, refers to those characteristics which do not characterize the Lord, for example: of Nature and the Individual Souls such as different states of existence, taking birth, etc.
# Moksha or State of Liberation does not refer to any characteristic place but it is the state of Individual Souls who have achieved Liberation. The Jivas or Individual Souls are characterized by four different states of existence which are: 1. Jagrat (Wakefulness), 2. Swapna (Dreaming), 3. Sushupti (Deep Sleep) and 4. Turiya. It is in the fourth Turiya state, that the Individual Souls exist without contact with Nature but are conscious of their own selves, other Individual Souls, and the Supreme Lord (or Eternal Truth). This state of Moksha or Turiya is not seen in the World hence incomparable but can only be realized. In this state they are free of every tinge of Nature and possess their own minds and experience bliss, the pleasure of their freedom, and the like, which are incomparable with any form of pleasure in the world. They are bodiless in that state and can attain any form of pleasure by their own will without requiring any external agent such as, for example, they can perform the function of ears on their ownself without requiring material ears, etc. In that state they are capable fulfilling of all their wishes, can go anywhere they want right then and there, witness the creation, maintenance, and dissolution of the worlds, they also come in contact with other individuals who are liberated. But in that state, the creative powers remain with the Supreme Lord because the powers of the Lord and the Lord himself are not different things. In Moksha, the individual souls remain distinct from one another and from the Supreme Lord. And, by means of their own capability and with the Supreme Lord as their means, they enjoy the bliss. After the period of Moksha, they pass on to this World again, in support of which, he quotes Veda Mantras and Mundaka Upanishad, in his book Satyarth Prakash and Rigvedadi Bhashya Bhumika.
# Again, it is the mark of Maharshi Dayanand&#x27;s wit that he reconciles the notion of unending or Eternal Moksha. He says, &quot;the &#x27;Eternal Moksha&#x27; or &#x27;Ananta Moksha&#x27;, refers to the &#x27;permanency of pleasures of Moksha&#x27; unlike the momentary pleasures of the World, and does not necessarily mean the individual souls will remain in Moksha permanently.&quot; He clarifies it by saying that the individual souls are permanent and hence their characteristics also, and it is &#x27;illogical&#x27; to consider that an individual soul would get trapped in one of the moments of the beginningless time, and escape the World for eternity by using the finite time period of his lives in different creature forms. Even if the illogical is accepted then also it means that even before he got trapped in Creation, he was in Moksha, and hence his Moksha period may fail at times is the conclusion that is contradictory to the assumption that Moksha is an infinite period of time. Hence, the Vedic teaching that the individual souls should come back after liberation should be considered valid. In a different point of view, he clarifies the same idea by saying that all actions whatever, are done for a finite time period cannot yield infinite results or fruit-of-actions, and after the period of Moksha, the jivas or individual should not have the capability to enjoy the bliss of Moksha further.

He opposed caste system, Sati practice, Murti worship, child marriage, etc. which are against the spirit of the Vedas and advocated that all evils of society should be thoroughly investigated and should be removed. The Varnashrama is based on education and profession and in his book Satyarth Prakash, he quotes passages from Manusmriti, Grihya Sutras, and Vedas which support his claims. He advocated the notion of &quot;One Government Throughout the World&quot;, also known as &quot;Chakradhipatya&quot;.

== Dayanand&#x27;s mission ==

 He believed that Hinduism had been corrupted by divergence from the founding principles of the Vedas and that Hindus had been misled by the priesthood for the priests&#x27; self-aggrandizement. For this mission, he founded the Arya Samaj, enunciating the Ten Universal Principles as a code for Universalism, called &quot;Krinvanto Vishwaryam&quot;. With these principles, he intended the whole world to be an abode for Aryas (Nobles).

His next step was to reform Hinduism with a new dedication to God. He travelled the country challenging religious scholars and priests to discussions, winning repeatedly through the strength of his arguments and knowledge of Sanskrit and Vedas. Hindu priests discouraged the laity from reading Vedic scriptures, and encouraged rituals, such as bathing in the Ganges River and feeding of priests on anniversaries, which Dayananda pronounced as superstitions or self-serving practices. By exhorting the nation to reject such superstitious notions, his aim was to educate the nation to return to the teachings of the Vedas, and to follow the Vedic way of life. He also exhorted Hindus to accept social reforms, including the importance of cows for national prosperity as well as the adoption of Hindi as the national language for national integration. Through his daily life and practice of yoga and asanas, teachings, preaching, sermons and writings, he inspired Hindus to aspire for &quot;Swarajya&quot; (self-governance), nationalism, and spiritualism. He advocated the equal rights and respects to women and advocated for the education of all children, regardless of gender.

Dayanand also made critical analyses of faiths including Christianity and Islam, as well as of other Indian faiths like Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. In addition to discouraging idolatry in Hinduism, he was also against what he considered to be the corruption of the true and pure faith in his own country. Unlike many other reform movements of his times within Hinduism, the Arya Samaj&#x27;s appeal was addressed not only to the educated few in India, but to the world as a whole as evidenced in the sixth principle of the Arya Samaj. As a result, his teachings professed universalism for all the living beings and not for any particular sect, faith, community or nation.

Arya Samaj allows and encourages converts to Hinduism. Dayananda&#x27;s concept of Dharma is stated in the &quot;Beliefs and Disbeliefs&quot; section of &quot;Satyartha Prakash,&quot; he says:
Dayananda&#x27;s Vedic message emphasized respect and reverence for other human beings, supported by the Vedic notion of the divine nature of the individual. In the Ten Principles of the Arya Samaj, he enshrined the idea that &quot;All actions should be performed with the prime objective of benefiting mankind&quot;, as opposed to following dogmatic rituals or revering idols and symbols. The first five principles speak of Truth, while the last five speak of a society with nobility, civics, co-living, and disciplined life. In his own life, he interpreted Moksha to be a lower calling, as it argued for benefits to the individual, rather than calling to emancipate others.

Dayananda&#x27;s &quot;back to the Vedas&quot; message influenced many thinkers and philosophers the world over.

===Activities===

Dayanand Saraswati is recorded to have been active since he was 14, which time he was able to recite religious verses and teach about them. He was respected at the time for taking part in religious debates. His debates were attended by large crowds.

On 22 October 1869 in Varanasi he lost a debate against 27 scholars and 12 expert pandits. The debate was said to have been attended by over 50,000 people. The main topic was &quot;Do the Vedas uphold deity worship ?&quot;

== Creation Of Arya Samaj ==
Dayananda Saraswati&#x27;s creation, the Arya Samaj, condemned practices of several different religions and communities, including such practices as idol worship, animal sacrifice, pilgrimages, priest craft, offerings made in temples, the castes, child marriage, meat eating and discrimination against women. He argued that all of these practices ran contrary to good sense and the wisdom of the Vedas.

== Views on superstitions ==

He severely criticized practices which he considered to be superstitions, including sorcery, and astrology, which were prevalent in India at the time. Below are several quotes from his book, Sathyarth Prakash:


On Astrology, he wrote:

He makes a clear distinction between Jyotisha Shaastra and astrology, calling astrology a fraud.

== Views on other religions ==

He considered the prevalent religions to have either immoral stories, or badly practised, or some of them have sufficiently moved away from the Vedas. In his book Satyarth Prakash, Maharshi Dayanand has analysed critically current form of Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Christianity and Islam.

===Islam===
He viewed Islam to be waging wars and immorality. He doubted that Islam had anything to do with the God, and questioned why a God would hate every non-believer, allowing the slaughter of animals, and command Muhammad to slaughter innocent people.

He further described Muhammad as &quot;imposter&quot;, and one who held out &quot;a bait to men and women, in the name of God, to compass his own selfish needs.&quot; He regarded Quran as &quot;Not the Word of God. It is a human work. Hence it cannot be believed in.&quot;

===Christianity===
His analysis of the Bible was based on an attempt to compare it with scientific evidence, morality, and other properties. His analysis claimed that the Bible contains many stories and precepts that are immoral, praising cruelty, deceit and that encourage sin. One commentary notes many alleged discrepancies and fallacies of logic in the Bible e.g. that God fearing Adam eating the fruit of life and becoming his equal displays jealousy. His critique attempts to show logical fallacies in the Bible, and throughout he asserts that the events depicted in the Bible portray God as a man rather than an omniscient, omnipotent or complete being.

He opposed the perpetual virginity of Mary, adding that such doctrines are simply against the nature of law, and that God would never break his own law because God is omniscient and infallible.

===Sikhism===
He regarded Guru Nanak as &quot;rogue&quot;, who was quite ignorant about Vedas, Sanskrit, Shashtra, and otherwise Nanak wouldn&#x27;t be mistaken with words. He further said that followers of Sikhism are to be blamed for making up stories that Nanak possessed miraculous powers and met God. He criticized Guru Gobind Singh and other Sikh Gurus, saying they &quot;invented fictitious stories&quot;, although he also recognized Gobind Singh to be &quot;indeed a very brave man.&quot;

===Jainism===
He regarded Jainism as &quot;a most dreadful religion&quot;, writing that Jains were intolerant and hostile towards the non-Jains.

===Buddhism===
Dayanand described Buddhism as &quot;anti-vedic&quot; and &quot;atheistic.&quot; He noted that the type of &quot;salvation&quot; Buddhism prescribes, is attainable even to dogs and donkeys. He further criticized the Buddhist cosmology which says that earth was not created.

==Assassination attempts==

Dayananda was subjected to many unsuccessful assassination attempts on his life.

According to his supporters, he was poisoned on a few occasions, but due to his regular practice of Hatha Yoga he survived all such attempts. One story tells that attackers once attempted to drown him in a river, but Dayananda dragged the assailants into the river instead, though he released them before they drowned.

Another account claims that he was attacked by Muslims who were offended by his criticism of Islam while meditating on the Ganges. They threw him into the water but he is claimed to have saved himself because his pranayama practice allowed him to stay under water until the attackers left.

== Assassination ==

In 1883, the Maharaja of Jodhpur, Jaswant Singh II, invited Dayananda to stay at his palace. The Maharaja was eager to become Dayananda&#x27;s disciple and to learn his teachings. Dayananda went to the Maharaja&#x27;s restroom during his stay and saw him with a dancing girl named Nanhi Jaan. Dayananda asked the Maharaja to forsake the girl and all unethical acts and to follow the Dharma like a true Arya (noble). Dayananda&#x27;s suggestion offended Nanhi, who decided to take revenge.

On 29 September 1883, Nanhi Jaan bribed Dayananda&#x27;s cook, Jagannath, to mix small pieces of glass in his nightly milk. Dayananda was served glass-laden milk before bed, which he promptly drank, becoming bedridden for several days, and suffering excruciating pain. The Maharaja quickly arranged doctor&#x27;s services for him. However, by the time doctors arrived, his condition had worsened, and he had developed large bleeding sores. Upon seeing Dayananda&#x27;s suffering, Jagannath was overwhelmed with guilt and confessed his crime to Dayananda. On his deathbed, Dayananda forgave him, and gave him a bag of money, telling him to flee the kingdom before he was found and executed by the Maharaja&#x27;s men.

Later, the Maharaja arranged for him to be sent to Mount Abu as per the advice of Residency, however, after staying for some time in Abu, on 26 October 1883, he was sent to Ajmer for better medical care, but the Rajadhiraj of Shahpura, Ajmer, Sir Nahar Singh Bahadur, was radicalized against the Arya Samaj through books written by Bhai Jawahir Singh Kapur, who was one of his close personal friends. There was no improvement in the Swami&#x27;s health, no medical aid was given and he died on the morning of the Hindu festival of Diwali on 30 October 1883 chanting mantras.

==Cremation and commemoration==
He breathed his last at &quot;Bhinai Kothi&quot; at Bhinai 54 km south of Ajmer, and his ashes were scattered at Ajmer in Rishi Udyan as per his wishes. Rishi Udyan, which has a functional Arya Samaj temple with daily morning and evening yajna homa, is located on the banks of Ana Sagar Lake off the NH58 Ajmer-Pushkar Highway. An annual 3 day &quot;Arya Samaj melā&quot; is held every year at &quot;Rishi Udyan&quot; on Rishi Dayanand&#x27;s death anniversary at the end of October, which also entails vedic seminars, vedas memorisation competition, yajna, and Dhavaja Rohan flag march. It is organized by the &quot;Paropkarini Sabha&quot;, which was founded by Swami Dayanand Saraswati on 16 August 1880 in Meerut, registered in Ajmer on 27 February 1883, and since 1893 has been operating from its office in Ajmer.

Every year on Maha Shivaratri, Arya Samajis celebrate Rishi Bodh Utsav during the 2 days mela at Tankara organized by Tankara Trust, during which Shobha Yatra procession and Maha Yajna is held; event is also attended by the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi and Chief Minister of Gujarat Vijay Rupani.

Navlakha Mahal inside Gulab Bagh and Zoo at Udaipur is also associated with him where he wrote the second edition of his seminal work, Satyarth Prakash, in Samvat 1939 (1882-83 CE).

==Legacy==

Maharshi Dayanand University in Rohtak, Maharshi Dayanand Saraswati University in Ajmer, DAV University (Dayanand Anglo-Vedic Schools System) in Jalandhar are named after him. So are over 800 schools and colleges under D.A.V. College Managing Committee, including Dayanand College at Ajmer. Industrialist Nanji Kalidas Mehta built the Maharshi Dayanand Science College and donated it to the Education Society of Porbandar, after naming it after Dayananda Saraswati.

Dayananda Saraswati is most notable for influencing the freedom movement of India. His views and writings have been used by various individuals, including Shyamji Krishna Varma, Subhas Chandra Bose, Lala Lajpat Rai, Madam Cama, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Lala Hardayal, Madan Lal Dhingra, Ram Prasad Bismil, Mahadev Govind Ranade, Swami Shraddhanand, S. Satyamurti, Pandit Lekh Ram, Mahatma Hansraj and others.

He also had a notable influence on Bhagat Singh. Singh, after finishing primary school, had joined the Dayanand Anglo Vedic Middle School, of Mohan Lal Road, in Lahore. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, on Shivratri day, 24 February 1964, wrote about Dayananda:

The places Dayanand visited during his life were often changed culturally as a result. Jodhpur adopted Hindi as main language, and later the present day Rajasthan did the same. Other admirers included Swami Vivekananda, Ramakrishna, Bipin Chandra Pal, Vallabhbhai Patel, Syama Prasad Mukherjee, and Romain Rolland, who regarded Dayananda as a remarkable and unique figure.

American Spiritualist Andrew Jackson Davis described Dayanand&#x27;s influence on him, calling Dayanand a &quot;Son of God&quot;, and applauding him for restoring the status of the Nation. Sten Konow, a Swedish scholar noted that Dayanand revived the history of India.

Others who were notably influenced by him include Ninian Smart, and Benjamin Walker.

== Achievements ==

Dayananda Saraswati wrote more than 60 works. This includes a 16-volume explanation of the Vedangas, an incomplete commentary on the Ashtadhyayi (Panini&#x27;s grammar), several small tracts on ethics and morality, Vedic rituals and sacraments, and a piece on the analysis of rival doctrines (such as Advaita Vedanta, Islam and Christianity). Some of his major works include the Satyarth Prakash, Satyarth Bhumika, Sanskarvidhi, Rigvedadi Bhashya Bhumika, Rigved Bhashyam (up to 7/61/2) and Yajurved Bhashyam. The Paropakarini Sabha located in the Indian city of Ajmer was founded by Saraswati to publish and preach his works and Vedic texts.
