<text>The Peloponnese ( ), Peloponnesus ( ; , ) or Morea (; ) is a peninsula and geographic region in Southern Greece, and the southernmost region of the Balkans. It is connected to the central part of the country by the Isthmus of Corinth land bridge which separates the Gulf of Corinth from the Saronic Gulf. From the late Middle Ages until the 19th century, the peninsula was known as the Morea, a name still in colloquial use in its demotic form.

The peninsula is divided among three administrative regions: most belongs to the Peloponnese region, with smaller parts belonging to the West Greece and Attica regions.

==Geography==

The Peloponnese is a peninsula located at the southern tip of the mainland, in area, and constitutes the southernmost part of mainland Greece. It is connected to the mainland by the Isthmus of Corinth, where the Corinth Canal was constructed in 1893. However, it is also connected to the mainland by several bridges across the canal, including two submersible bridges at the north and the south end. Near the northern tip of the peninsula, there is another bridge, the Rio–Antirrio bridge (completed 2004). The peninsula has a mountainous interior, although extensive lowlands are also found in the west, in the Evrotas Valley in the south, and in the Argolid Peninsula in the northeast. The Peloponnese possesses four south-pointing peninsulas, the Messenian, the Mani, the Cape Malea (also known as Epidaurus Limera), and the Argolid in the far northeast of the Peloponnese. Mount Taygetus in the south is the highest mountain in the Peloponnese, at . Οther important mountains include Cyllene in the northeast (), Aroania in the north (), Erymanthos () and Panachaikon in the northwest (), Mainalon in the center (), and Parnon in the southeast (). The entire peninsula is earthquake-prone and has been the site of many earthquakes in the past.

The longest river is the Alfeios in the west (), followed by the Evrotas in the south (), and also the Pineios, also in the west (). The Peloponnese, with its indented coasts, is home to numerous spectacular beaches, which are a major tourist draw.

Two groups of islands lie off the Peloponnesian coast: the Argo-Saronic Islands to the east, and the Ionian to the west. The island of Kythira, off the Epidaurus Limeira peninsula to the south of the Peloponnese, is considered to be part of the Ionian Islands. The island of Elafonisos used to be part of the peninsula but was separated following the major quake of 365 AD.

Since antiquity, and continuing to the present day, the Peloponnese has been divided into seven major regions: Achaea (north), Corinthia (northeast), Argolis (east), Arcadia (center), Laconia (southeast), Messenia (southwest), and Elis (west). Each of these regions is headed by a city. The largest city is Patras (pop. 170,000) in Achaia, followed by Kalamata (pop. 55,000) in Messenia.

===Climate===
Peloponnese for the most part enjoys a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;), while the Gulf of Corinth has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSh&quot;). Rainfall is higher in the west coasts, while the east of the peninsula is significantly drier. Average annual temperatures can reach up to while summer highs reach over in Sparta, within the Evrotas Valley. On 27 June 2007, Monemvasia registered a staggering minimum temperature of 35.9°C, which is the highest minimum temperature ever recorded in mainland Greece and Continental Europe. 



==History==

=== Mythology and early history ===

The peninsula has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Its modern name derives from ancient Greek mythology, specifically the legend of the hero Pelops, who was said to have conquered the entire region. The name &quot;Peloponnesos&quot; means Island or Peninsula (archaic meaning of the word ) of Pelops.

The Mycenaean civilization, mainland Greece&#x27;s (and Europe&#x27;s) first major civilization, dominated the Peloponnese in the Bronze Age from the palaces of Mycenae, Pylos and Tiryns; among others. The Mycenaean civilization collapsed suddenly at the end of the 2nd millennium BC. Archeological research has found that many of its cities and palaces show signs of destruction. The subsequent period, known as the Greek Dark Ages, is marked by an absence of written records.

=== Classical antiquity ===

In 776 BC, the first Olympic Games were held at Olympia, in the western Peloponnese and this date is sometimes used to denote the beginning of the classical period of Greek antiquity. During classical antiquity, the Peloponnese was at the heart of the affairs of ancient Greece, possessed some of its most powerful city-states, and was the location of some of its bloodiest battles.

The major cities of Sparta, Corinth, Argos and Megalopolis were all located on the Peloponnese, and it was the homeland of the Peloponnesian League. Soldiers from the peninsula fought in the Persian Wars, and it was also the scene of the Peloponnesian War of 431–404 BC. The entire Peloponnese with the notable exception of Sparta joined Alexander&#x27;s expedition against the Persian Empire.

Along with the rest of Greece, the Peloponnese fell to the expanding Roman Republic in 146 BC, when the Romans razed the city of Corinth and massacred its inhabitants. The Romans created the province of Achaea comprising the Peloponnese and central Greece. During the Roman period, the peninsula remained prosperous but became a provincial backwater, relatively cut off from the affairs of the wider Roman world.

===Middle Ages===

====Byzantine rule====

After the partition of the Empire in 395, the Peloponnese became a part of the East Roman or Byzantine Empire. The devastation of Alaric&#x27;s raid in 396–397 led to the construction of the Hexamilion wall across the Isthmus of Corinth. Through most of late antiquity, the peninsula retained its urbanized character: in the 6th century, Hierocles counted 26 cities in his &quot;Synecdemus&quot;. By the latter part of that century, however, building activity seems to have stopped virtually everywhere except in Constantinople, Thessalonica, Corinth, and Athens. This has traditionally been attributed to calamities such as plague, earthquakes and Slavic invasions. However, more recent analysis suggests that urban decline was closely linked with the collapse of long-distance and regional commercial networks that underpinned and supported late antique urbanism in Greece, as well as with the generalized withdrawal of imperial troops and administration from the Balkans.

====Slavic invasion, settlement and decline====
The scale of the Slavic invasion and settlement in the 7th and 8th centuries remains a matter of dispute, although it is nowadays considered much smaller than previously thought. The Slavs did occupy most of the peninsula, as evidenced by the abundance of Slavic toponyms, but these toponyms accumulated over centuries rather than as a result of an initial &quot;flood&quot; of Slavic invasions, and many appear to have been mediated by speakers of Greek, or in mixed Slavic-Greek compounds.

Fewer Slavic toponyms appear on the eastern coast, which remained in Byzantine hands and was included in the &quot;thema&quot; of Hellas, established by Justinian II . While traditional historiography has dated the arrival of Slavs to southern Greece to the late 6th century, according to Florin Curta there is no evidence for a Slavic presence in the Peloponnese until after , when Slavs may have been allowed to settle in specific areas that had been depopulated.

Relations between the Slavs and Greeks were probably peaceful apart from intermittent uprisings. There was also a continuity of the Peloponnesian Greek population. This is especially true in Mani and Tsakonia, where Slavic incursions were minimal, or non-existent. Being agriculturalists, the Slavs probably traded with the Greeks, who remained in the towns, while Greek villages continued to exist in the interior, governing themselves, possibly paying tribute to the Slavs. The first attempt by the Byzantine imperial government to re-assert its control over the independent Slavic tribes of the Peloponnese occurred in 783, with the logothete Staurakios&#x27; overland campaign from Constantinople into Greece and the Peloponnese, which according to Theophanes the Confessor made many prisoners and forced the Slavs to pay tribute.
From the mid-9th century, following a Slavic revolt and attack on Patras, a determined Hellenization process was carried out. According to the &quot;Chronicle of Monemvasia&quot;, in 805 the Byzantine governor of Corinth went to war with the Slavs, exterminated them, and allowed the original inhabitants to claim their lands. They regained control of the city of Patras and the region was re-settled with Greeks. Many Slavs were transported to Asia Minor, and many Asian, Sicilian and Calabrian Greeks were resettled in the Peloponnese. By the turn of the 9th century, the entire Peloponnese was formed into the new &quot;thema&quot; of Peloponnesos, with its capital at Corinth.

The imposition of Byzantine rule over the Slavic enclaves may have largely been a process of Christianization and accommodation of Slavic chieftains into the Imperial fold, as literary, epigraphic and sigillographic evidence testify to Slavic &quot;archontes&quot; participating in Imperial affairs. By the end of the 9th century, the Peloponnese was culturally and administratively Greek again, except for a few small Slavic tribes in the mountains such as the Melingoi and Ezeritai. Although they were to remain relatively autonomous until Ottoman times, such tribes were the exception rather than the rule. Even the Melingoi and Ezeritai, however, could speak Greek and appear to have been Christian.

The success of the Hellenization campaign also shows that the Slavs had settled among many Greeks, in contrast to areas further north in what is now Bulgaria and the former Yugoslavia, as those areas could not be Hellenized when they were recovered by the Byzantines in the early 11th century. A human genetics study in 2017 showed that the Peloponnesians have little admixture with populations of the Slavic homeland and are much closer to Sicilians and southern Italians.

Apart from the troubled relations with the Slavs, the coastal regions of the Peloponnese suffered greatly from repeated Arab raids following the Arab capture of Crete in the 820s and the establishment of a corsair emirate there. After the island was recovered by Byzantium in 961 however, the region entered a period of renewed prosperity, where agriculture, commerce, and urban industry flourished.

====Frankish rule and Byzantine reconquest====


In 1205, following the destruction of the Byzantine Empire by the forces of the Fourth Crusade, the Crusaders under William of Champlitte and Geoffrey of Villehardouin marched south through mainland Greece and conquered the Peloponnese against sporadic local Greek resistance. The Franks then founded the Principality of Achaea, nominally a vassal of the Latin Empire, while the Venetians occupied several strategically important ports around the coast such as Navarino and Coron, which they retained into the 15th century. The Franks popularized the name &quot;Morea&quot; for the peninsula, which first appears as the name of a small bishopric in Elis during the 10th century. Its etymology is disputed, but it is most commonly held to be derived from the mulberry tree (&quot;morea&quot;), whose leaves are similar in shape to the peninsula.

In 1208, William I founded a commission at Andravida consisted of Latin bishops, two bannerets and five Greek magnates and chaired by himself, to assess the land and divide it, according to Latin practice, in fiefs. The result was divide the country into twelve baronies, mostly centred around a newly constructed castle—a testament to the fact that the Franks were a military elite amidst a potentially hostile Greek population. The twelve temporal barons were joined by seven ecclesiastic lords, headed by the Latin Archbishop of Patras. Each of the latter was granted a number of estates as knightly fiefs, with the Archbishop receiving eight, the other bishops four each, and likewise four granted to each of the military orders: the Templars, Hospitallers and the Teutonic Knights. Shortly after 1260, a thirteenth barony, that of Arcadia (modern Kyparissia) was established, which was also a personal fief of the Villehardouins. The barons retained considerable powers and privileges, so that the Prince was not an absolute sovereign but rather a &quot;first among equals&quot; among them. Thus they had the right to construct a castle without the Prince&#x27;s permission, or to decree capital punishment. Since Salic Law was not adopted in Achaea, women could also inherit the fiefs. 

====Despotate of Morea and Ottoman incursions====
Frankish supremacy in the peninsula, however, received a critical blow after the Battle of Pelagonia, when William II of Villehardouin was forced to cede the newly constructed fortress and palace at Mystras near ancient Sparta to a resurgent Byzantium. At this point, the emperor concluded an agreement with the captive prince: William and his men would be set free in exchange for an oath of fealty, and for the cession of Monemvasia, Grand Magne, and Mystras. The handover was effected in 1262, and henceforth Mystras was the seat of the governor of the Byzantine territories in the Morea. Initially this governor (&quot;kephale&quot;) was changed every year, but after 1308 they started being appointed for longer terms. Almost immediately on his return to the Morea, William of Villehardouin renounced his oath to the emperor, and warfare broke out between Byzantines and Franks. The first Byzantine attempts to subdue the Principality of Achaea were beaten back in the battles of Prinitsa and Makryplagi, but the Byzantines were firmly ensconced in Laconia. Warfare became endemic, and the Byzantines slowly pushed the Franks back. The insecurity engendered by the raids and counter-raids caused the inhabitants of Lacedaemon to abandon their exposed city and settle at Mystras, in a new town built under the shadow of the fortress.

While Mystras served as the provincial capital from this time, it became a royal capital in 1349, when the first despot was appointed to rule over the Morea. The Byzantine Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos, reorganized the territory in 1349 to establish it as an appanage for his son, the Despot Manuel Kantakouzenos. Around that time, the Ottoman Turks began raiding the Peloponnese, but their raids intensified only after 1387 when the energetic Evrenos Bey took control. Exploiting the quarrels between Byzantines and Franks, he plundered across the peninsula and forced both the Byzantine despots and the remaining Frankish rulers to acknowledge Ottoman suzerainty and pay tribute. This situation lasted until the Ottoman defeat at the Battle of Ankara in 1402, after which Ottoman power was for a time checked. From 1349 until its surrender to the Ottoman Turks on 31 May 1460, Mystras was the residence of a Despot who ruled over the Byzantine Morea, known as the &quot;Despotate of the Morea&quot;. For the larger portion of his reign, Manuel maintained peaceful relations with his Latin neighbors and secured a long period of prosperity for the area. Greco-Latin cooperation included an alliance to contain the raids of the Ottoman Sultan Murad I into Morea in the 1360s. The rival Palaiologos dynasty seized the Morea after Manuel&#x27;s death in 1380, with Theodore I Palaiologos becoming despot in 1383. 

Theodore I ruled until 1407, consolidating Byzantine rule and coming to terms with his more powerful neighbours—particularly the expansionist Ottoman Empire, whose suzerainty he recognised. Subsequent despots were the sons of the Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, brother of the despot Theodore: Theodore II, Constantine, Demetrios, and Thomas. As Latin power in the Peloponnese waned during the 15th century, the Despotate of the Morea expanded to incorporate the entire peninsula in 1430 with territory being acquired by dowry settlements, and the conquest of Patras by Constantine. However, in 1446 the Ottoman Sultan Murad II destroyed the Byzantine defences—the Hexamilion wall at the Isthmus of Corinth. His attack opened the peninsula to invasion, though Murad died before he could exploit this. His successor Mehmed II &quot;the Conqueror&quot; captured the Byzantine capital Constantinople in 1453. The despots, Demetrios Palaiologos and Thomas Palaiologos, brothers of the last emperor, failed to send him any aid, as Morea was recovering from a recent Ottoman attack. Their own incompetence resulted in the Morea revolt of 1453–1454 led by Manuel Kantakouzenos against them, during which they invited in Ottoman troops to help them put down the revolt. At this time, the Greek &quot;archons&quot; made peace with Mehmed. After more years of incompetent rule by the despots, their failure to pay their annual tribute to the Sultan, and finally their own revolt against Ottoman rule, Mehmed came into the Morea in May 1460. Demetrios ended up a prisoner of the Ottomans and his younger brother Thomas fled. By the end of the summer the Ottomans had achieved the submission of virtually all cities possessed by the Greeks.

Ottoman incursions into the Morea resumed under Turahan Bey after 1423. Despite the reconstruction of the Hexamilion wall at the Isthmus of Corinth, the Ottomans under Murad II breached it in 1446, forcing the Despots of the Morea to re-acknowledge Ottoman suzerainty, and again under Turahan in 1452 and 1456. Following the occupation of the Duchy of Athens in 1456, the Ottomans occupied a third of the Peloponnese in 1458, and Sultan Mehmed II extinguished the remnants of the Despotate in 1460. A few holdouts remained for a time. The rocky peninsula of Monemvasia refused to surrender, and it was first ruled for a brief time by a Catalan corsair. When the population drove him out, they obtained the consent of Thomas to submit to the Pope&#x27;s protection before the end of 1460. The Mani Peninsula at the south end of the Morea resisted under a loose coalition of the local clans, and that area then came under Venice&#x27;s rule. The last holdout was Salmeniko, in the Morea&#x27;s northwest. Graitzas Palaiologos was the military commander there, stationed at Salmeniko Castle. While the town eventually surrendered, Graitzas and his garrison and some town residents held out in the castle until July 1461, when they escaped and reached Venetian territory. Only the Venetian fortresses of Modon, Coron, Navarino, Monemvasia, Argos and Nauplion escaped Ottoman control.

====Albanian migration, settlement and relocations to Italy====

The same period was also marked by the migration and settlement of Christian Albanians to parts of Central Greece and the Peloponnese, a group that eventually became known as the Arvanites The Albanians settled in successive waves, often invited by the local rulers. They start appearing more frequently in the historical record from during the second part of the 14th century, when they were being offered arable land, pasture and favorable taxation in exchange for military service. One of the larger groups of Albanian settlers, amounting to 10,000, settled the Peloponnese during the reign of Theodore I Palaiologos, first in Arcadia and subsequently in other regions around Messenia, Argolis, Elis and Achaia. Around 1418, a second large group arrived, possibly fleeing Aetolia, Acarnania and Arta, where Albanian political power had been defeated. The settling Albanians lived in tribes spread out into small villages, practicing nomadic lifestyles based on pastoralism and animal husbandry. By the mid-15th century, they formed a substantial part of the population of the Peloponnesus. Military sources of the era (1425) report about 30,000 Albanian men who could carry arms in the Peloponnese. The Greeks tended to live in large villages and cities, while Albanians in small villages. 

Following Ottoman conquest, many Albanians fled to Italy, settling primarily in nowadays Arbereshe villages of Calabria and Sicily. On the other hand, in an effort to control the remaining Albanians, during the second half of the 15th century, the Ottomans adopted favorable tax policies towards them, likely in continuation of similar Byzantine practices. This policy had been discontinued by the early 16th century. Throughout the Ottoman–Venetian wars, many Albanians died or were captured in service to the Venetians; at Nafpaktos, Nafplio, Argos, Methoni, Koroni and Pylos. Furthermore, 8,000 Albanian stratioti, most of them along with their families, left the Peloponnese to continue their military service under the Republic of Venice or the Kingdom of Naples. At the end of the Ottoman–Venetian wars, a large number of Albanians had fled from the Peloponnese to Sicily. 

A demographic census by Alfred Philippson, based on fieldwork between 1887 and 1889, found that out of the approximately 730,000 inhabitants of the Peloponnese, and the three neighboring islands of Poros, Hydra and Spetses, Arvanites numbered 90,253, or 12.3% of the total population.

===Ottoman conquest, Venetian interlude and Ottoman reconquest===

The Venetian fortresses were conquered in a series of Ottoman-Venetian Wars: the first war, lasting from 1463 to 1479, saw much fighting in the Peloponnese, resulting in the loss of Argos, while Modon and Coron fell in 1500 during the second war. Coron and Patras were captured in a crusading expedition in 1532, led by the Genoese admiral Andrea Doria, but this provoked another war in which the last Venetian possessions on the Greek mainland were lost.

Following the Ottoman conquest, the peninsula was made into a province (&quot;sanjak&quot;), with 109 &quot;ziamets&quot; and 342 &quot;timars&quot;. During the first period of Ottoman rule (1460–1687), the capital was first in Corinth (Turk. &quot;Gördes&quot;), later in Leontari (&quot;Londari&quot;), Mystras (&quot;Misistire&quot;) and finally in Nauplion (Tr. &quot;Anaboli&quot;). Sometime in the mid-17th century, the Morea became the centre of a separate &quot;eyalet&quot;, with Patras (&quot;Ballibadra&quot;) as its capital. Until the death of Suleiman the Magnificent in 1570, the Christian population (counted at some 42,000 families c. 1550) managed to retain some privileges and Islamization was slow, mostly among the Albanians or the estate owners who were integrated into the Ottoman feudal system.

Although they quickly came to control most of the fertile lands, Muslims remained a distinct minority. Christian communities retained a large measure of self-government, but the entire Ottoman period was marked by a flight of the Christian population from the plains to the mountains. This occasioned the rise of the &quot;klepht&quot;s, armed brigands and rebels, in the mountains, as well as the corresponding institution of the government-funded &quot;armatoloi&quot; to check the &quot;klephts&quot;″ activities.

With the outbreak of the &quot;Great Turkish War&quot; in 1683, the Venetians under Francesco Morosini occupied the entire peninsula by 1687, and received recognition by the Ottomans in the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699). The Venetians established their province as the &quot;Kingdom of the Morea&quot; (It. &quot;Regno di Morea&quot;), but their rule proved unpopular, and when the Ottomans invaded the peninsula in 1715, most local Greeks welcomed them. The Ottoman reconquest was easy and swift, and was recognized by Venice in the Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718.

The Peloponnese now became the core of the Morea Eyalet, headed by the &quot;Mora valesi&quot;, who until 1780 was a pasha of the first rank (with three horsetails) and held the title of vizier. After 1780 and until the Greek War of Independence, the province was headed by a &quot;muhassil&quot;. The pasha of the Morea was aided by several subordinate officials, including a Christian translator (&quot;dragoman&quot;), who was the senior Christian official of the province. As during the first Ottoman period, the Morea was divided into 22 districts or beyliks. The capital was first at Nauplion, but after 1786 at Tripolitza (Tr. &quot;Trabliçe&quot;).

The Greeks of the Peloponnese rose against the Ottomans with Russian aid during the so-called &quot;Orlov Revolt&quot; of 1770, but it was swiftly and brutally suppressed by bands of Muslim Albanian mercenaries hired by the Ottomans. Referred to by the local Greek populace as &quot;Turk-Albanians&quot;, those forces had also destroyed many cities and towns in Epirus during the 1769–70 revolt there. The Peloponnese suffered more than any other Greek inhabited area by irregular Albanian gangs during the decades following. In Patras nearly no one was left alive after the Turkish-Albanian invasion. The city of Mystras was left in ruins and the metropolitan bishop Ananias was executed despite having saved the life of several Turks during the uprising. A great number of local Greeks were killed by the Albanian groups, while children were sold to slavery. It is estimated that 20,000 local Greeks were captured during those nine years of devastation by those Albanian mercenaries and sold to slave markets. Also an additional of 50,000 Greeks left Peloponesse: around one-sixth of the pre-1770 population.

The Ottoman government was unable to pay the wages the Albanian mercenaries demanded for their service, causing the latter to ravage the region even after revolt had been put down. 1770-1779 was a prolonged period of devastation and atrocities committed by Albanian irregulars in the Peloponnese. In 1774 the Russo-Turkish War ended with the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca which granted general amnesty to the population. Nevertheless, attacks by Muslim Albanian mercenaries in the region continued not only against the Greek population but also against Turks. The extensive destruction and lack of control in the Peloponnese forced the central Ottoman government to send a regular Turkish military force to suppress those Albanian troops in 1779, and eventually drive them out from Peloponnese. As a result of the invasion by those mercenary groups the local population had to found refuge in the mountains of Peloponnese to avoid persecution. The total population decreased during this time, while the Muslim element in it increased.

As such Greek resistance in the peninsula was reinforced and powerful groups of klephts were formed under the clans of Zacharias, Melios, Petmezas and Kolokotronis. Klephtic songs of that era describe the resistance activities. Nevertheless, through the privileges granted with the Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji, especially the right for the Christians to trade under the Russian flag, led to a considerable economic flowering of the local Greeks, which, coupled with the increased cultural contacts with Western Europe (Modern Greek Enlightenment) and the inspiring ideals of the French Revolution, laid the groundwork for the Greek War of Independence.

===Modern Greece===


The Peloponnesians played a major role in the Greek War of Independence – the war began in the Peloponnese, when rebels took control of Kalamata on March 23, 1821. After the arrival of Ypsilantis&#x27;s emissaries, local people rose under the leadership of Mavromichalis. Greek and Albanian insurgents organised in units of armed civilians took control of most of the fortresses. The Greek insurgents made rapid progress and the entire peninsula was under Greek control within a few months, except for a few coastal forts and the main Turkish garrison at Tripolitsa. The fighting was fierce and marked by atrocities on both sides; eventually the entire Muslim population was either massacred or fled to the forts. The capture of Tripolitsa in September 1821 marked a turning point. Rivalries among the insurgents eventually erupted into civil war in 1824, which enabled the Ottoman Egyptian vassal Ibrahim Pasha to land in the peninsula in 1825.

The Peloponnese peninsula was the scene of fierce fighting and extensive devastation following the arrival of Ibrahim&#x27;s Egyptian troops. Partly as a result of the atrocities committed by Ibrahim, the UK, France, and the Russian Empire decided to intervene in favor of the Greeks. The decisive naval Battle of Navarino was fought in 1827 off Pylos on the west coast of the Peloponnese, where a combined British, French and Russian fleet decisively defeated the Turko-Egyptian fleet. Subsequently, a French expeditionary corps cleared the last Turko-Egyptian forces from the peninsula in 1828. The city of Nafplion, on the east coast of the peninsula, became the first capital of the independent Greek state. By the conclusion of the war, the entire Muslim population of the newly independent Greek state, including the Peloponnese, had been exterminated or had fled.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the region became relatively poor and economically isolated. A significant part of its population emigrated to the larger cities of Greece, especially Athens, and other countries such as the United States and Australia. It was badly affected by the Second World War and Greek Civil War, experiencing some of the worst atrocities committed in Greece during those conflicts. Living standards improved dramatically throughout Greece after the country accedes to the European Union in 1981.

The Corinth Canal was completed in the late 19th century, linking the Aegean Sea with the Gulf of Corinth and the Ionian. In 2001, the Rio-Antirio Bridge was completed, linking the western Peloponnese to western Greece. In late August 2007, large parts of Peloponnese suffered from wildfires, which caused severe damage in villages and forests and the death of 77 people. The impact of the fires to the environment and economy of the region are still unknown. It is thought to be one of the largest environmental disasters in modern Greek history.

<text>In mathematics, a topological vector space (also called a linear topological space and commonly abbreviated TVS or t.v.s.) is one of the basic structures investigated in functional analysis.
A topological vector space is a vector space that is also a topological space with the property that the vector space operations (vector addition and scalar multiplication) are also continuous functions. Such a topology is called a and every topological vector space has a uniform topological structure, allowing a notion of uniform convergence and completeness. Some authors also require that the space is a Hausdorff space (although this article does not). One of the most widely studied categories of TVSs are locally convex topological vector spaces. This article focuses on TVSs that are not necessarily locally convex. Other well-known examples of TVSs include Banach spaces, Hilbert spaces and Sobolev spaces.

Many topological vector spaces are spaces of functions, or linear operators acting on topological vector spaces, and the topology is often defined so as to capture a particular notion of convergence of sequences of functions.

In this article, the scalar field of a topological vector space will be assumed to be either the complex numbers formula_1 or the real numbers formula_2 unless clearly stated otherwise. 

==Motivation==

===Normed spaces===

Every normed vector space has a natural topological structure: the norm induces a metric and the metric induces a topology.
This is a topological vector space because:
#The vector addition map formula_3 defined by formula_4 is (jointly) continuous with respect to this topology. This follows directly from the triangle inequality obeyed by the norm.
#The scalar multiplication map formula_5 defined by formula_6 where formula_7 is the underlying scalar field of formula_8 is (jointly) continuous. This follows from the triangle inequality and homogeneity of the norm.

Thus all Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces are examples of topological vector spaces.

===Non-normed spaces===

There are topological vector spaces whose topology is not induced by a norm, but are still of interest in analysis. Examples of such spaces are spaces of holomorphic functions on an open domain, spaces of infinitely differentiable functions, the Schwartz spaces, and spaces of test functions and the spaces of distributions on them. These are all examples of Montel spaces. An infinite-dimensional Montel space is never normable. The existence of a norm for a given topological vector space is characterized by Kolmogorov&#x27;s normability criterion. 

A topological field is a topological vector space over each of its subfields.

==Definition==

A topological vector space (TVS) formula_9 is a vector space over a topological field formula_7 (most often the real or complex numbers with their standard topologies) that is endowed with a topology such that vector addition formula_3 and scalar multiplication formula_5 are continuous functions (where the domains of these functions are endowed with product topologies). Such a topology is called a &#x27; or a &#x27; on formula_13

Every topological vector space is also a commutative topological group under addition.

Hausdorff assumption

Many authors (for example, Walter Rudin), but not this page, require the topology on formula_9 to be T1; it then follows that the space is Hausdorff, and even Tychonoff. A topological vector space is said to be if it is Hausdorff; importantly, &quot;separated&quot; does not mean separable. The topological and linear algebraic structures can be tied together even more closely with additional assumptions, the most common of which are listed below.

Category and morphisms

The category of topological vector spaces over a given topological field formula_7 is commonly denoted formula_16 or formula_17 The objects are the topological vector spaces over formula_7 and the morphisms are the continuous formula_7-linear maps from one object to another.

A (abbreviated ), also called a , is a continuous linear map formula_20 between topological vector spaces (TVSs) such that the induced map formula_21 is an open mapping when formula_22 which is the range or image of formula_23 is given the subspace topology induced by formula_24

A (abbreviated ), also called a , is an injective topological homomorphism. Equivalently, a TVS-embedding is a linear map that is also a topological embedding.

A (abbreviated ), also called a or an , is a bijective linear homeomorphism. Equivalently, it is a surjective TVS embedding

Many properties of TVSs that are studied, such as local convexity, metrizability, completeness, and normability, are invariant under TVS isomorphisms.

A necessary condition for a vector topology

A collection formula_25 of subsets of a vector space is called if for every formula_26 there exists some formula_27 such that formula_28

All of the above conditions are consequently a necessity for a topology to form a vector topology.

===Defining topologies using neighborhoods of the origin===

Since every vector topology is translation invariant (which means that for all formula_29 the map formula_30 defined by formula_31 is a homeomorphism), to define a vector topology it suffices to define a neighborhood basis (or subbasis) for it at the origin.

In general, the set of all balanced and absorbing subsets of a vector space does not satisfy the conditions of this theorem and does not form a neighborhood basis at the origin for any vector topology.
===Defining topologies using strings===

Let formula_9 be a vector space and let formula_33 be a sequence of subsets of formula_13 Each set in the sequence formula_35 is called a of formula_35 and for every index formula_37 formula_38 is called the formula_39-th knot of formula_40 The set formula_41 is called the beginning of formula_40 The sequence formula_35 is/is a:

* if formula_44 for every index formula_45
* Balanced (resp. absorbing, closed, convex, open, symmetric, barrelled, absolutely convex/disked, etc.) if this is true of every formula_46
* if formula_35 is summative, absorbing, and balanced.
* &#x27; or a &#x27; in a TVS formula_9 if formula_35 is a string and each of its knots is a neighborhood of the origin in formula_13
If formula_51 is an absorbing disk in a vector space formula_9 then the sequence defined by formula_53 forms a string beginning with formula_54 This is called the natural string of formula_51 Moreover, if a vector space formula_9 has countable dimension then every string contains an absolutely convex string.

Summative sequences of sets have the particularly nice property that they define non-negative continuous real-valued subadditive functions. These functions can then be used to prove many of the basic properties of topological vector spaces.
A proof of the above theorem is given in the article on metrizable topological vector spaces.

If formula_57 and formula_58 are two collections of subsets of a vector space formula_9 and if formula_60 is a scalar, then by definition:

* formula_61 contains formula_35: formula_63 if and only if formula_64 for every index formula_45
* Set of knots: formula_66
* Kernel: formula_67
* Scalar multiple: formula_68
* Sum: formula_69
* Intersection: formula_70

If formula_71 is a collection sequences of subsets of formula_8 then formula_71 is said to be directed (downwards) under inclusion or simply directed downward if formula_71 is not empty and for all formula_75 there exists some formula_76 such that formula_77 and formula_78 (said differently, if and only if formula_71 is a prefilter with respect to the containment formula_80 defined above).

Notation: Let formula_81 be the set of all knots of all strings in formula_82

Defining vector topologies using collections of strings is particularly useful for defining classes of TVSs that are not necessarily locally convex.

If formula_71 is the set of all topological strings in a TVS formula_84 then formula_85 A Hausdorff TVS is metrizable if and only if its topology can be induced by a single topological string.

==Topological structure==

A vector space is an abelian group with respect to the operation of addition, and in a topological vector space the inverse operation is always continuous (since it is the same as multiplication by formula_86). Hence, every topological vector space is an abelian topological group. Every TVS is completely regular but a TVS need not be normal.

Let formula_9 be a topological vector space. Given a subspace formula_88 the quotient space formula_89 with the usual quotient topology is a Hausdorff topological vector space if and only if formula_90 is closed. This permits the following construction: given a topological vector space formula_9 (that is probably not Hausdorff), form the quotient space formula_89 where formula_90 is the closure of formula_94 formula_89 is then a Hausdorff topological vector space that can be studied instead of formula_13

===Invariance of vector topologies===

One of the most used properties of vector topologies is that every vector topology is :
:for all formula_29 the map formula_30 defined by formula_31 is a homeomorphism, but if formula_100 then it is not linear and so not a TVS-isomorphism.
Scalar multiplication by a non-zero scalar is a TVS-isomorphism. This means that if formula_101 then the linear map formula_30 defined by formula_103 is a homeomorphism. Using formula_104 produces the negation map formula_30 defined by formula_106 which is consequently a linear homeomorphism and thus a TVS-isomorphism.

If formula_107 and any subset formula_108 then formula_109 and moreover, if formula_110 then formula_111 is a neighborhood (resp. open neighborhood, closed neighborhood) of formula_112 in formula_9 if and only if the same is true of formula_114 at the origin.

===Local notions===

A subset formula_115 of a vector space formula_9 is said to be
* absorbing (in formula_9): if for every formula_118 there exists a real formula_119 such that formula_120 for any scalar formula_121 satisfying formula_122
* balanced or circled: if formula_123 for every scalar formula_124
* convex: if formula_125 for every real formula_126
* a disk or absolutely convex: if formula_115 is convex and balanced.
* symmetric: if formula_128 or equivalently, if formula_129

Every neighborhood of the origin is an absorbing set and contains an open balanced neighborhood of formula_130 so every topological vector space has a local base of absorbing and balanced sets. The origin even has a neighborhood basis consisting of closed balanced neighborhoods of formula_131 if the space is locally convex then it also has a neighborhood basis consisting of closed convex balanced neighborhoods of the origin.

Bounded subsets

A subset formula_115 of a topological vector space formula_9 is bounded if for every neighborhood formula_134 of the origin there exists formula_135 such that formula_136.

The definition of boundedness can be weakened a bit; formula_115 is bounded if and only if every countable subset of it is bounded. A set is bounded if and only if each of its subsequences is a bounded set. Also, formula_115 is bounded if and only if for every balanced neighborhood formula_134 of the origin, there exists formula_135 such that formula_141 Moreover, when formula_9 is locally convex, the boundedness can be characterized by seminorms: the subset formula_115 is bounded if and only if every continuous seminorm formula_144 is bounded on formula_145

Every totally bounded set is bounded. If formula_90 is a vector subspace of a TVS formula_8 then a subset of formula_90 is bounded in formula_90 if and only if it is bounded in formula_13

===Metrizability===

A TVS is pseudometrizable if and only if it has a countable neighborhood basis at the origin, or equivalent, if and only if its topology is generated by an &quot;F&quot;-seminorm. A TVS is metrizable if and only if it is Hausdorff and pseudometrizable.

More strongly: a topological vector space is said to be normable if its topology can be induced by a norm. A topological vector space is normable if and only if it is Hausdorff and has a convex bounded neighborhood of the origin.

Let formula_7 be a non-discrete locally compact topological field, for example the real or complex numbers. A Hausdorff topological vector space over formula_7 is locally compact if and only if it is finite-dimensional, that is, isomorphic to formula_153 for some natural number formula_154

===Completeness and uniform structure===
The canonical uniformity on a TVS formula_84 is the unique translation-invariant uniformity that induces the topology formula_156 on formula_13

Every TVS is assumed to be endowed with this canonical uniformity, which makes all TVSs into uniform spaces. This allows one to talk about related notions such as completeness, uniform convergence, Cauchy nets, and uniform continuity, etc., which are always assumed to be with respect to this uniformity (unless indicated other). This implies that every Hausdorff topological vector space is Tychonoff. A subset of a TVS is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded (for Hausdorff TVSs, a set being totally bounded is equivalent to it being precompact). But if the TVS is not Hausdorff then there exist compact subsets that are not closed. However, the closure of a compact subset of a non-Hausdorff TVS is again compact (so compact subsets are relatively compact).

With respect to this uniformity, a net (or sequence) formula_158 is Cauchy if and only if for every neighborhood formula_134 of formula_160 there exists some index formula_161 such that formula_162 whenever formula_163 and formula_164

Every Cauchy sequence is bounded, although Cauchy nets and Cauchy filters may not be bounded. A topological vector space where every Cauchy sequence converges is called sequentially complete; in general, it may not be complete (in the sense that all Cauchy filters converge).

The vector space operation of addition is uniformly continuous and an open map. Scalar multiplication is Cauchy continuous but in general, it is almost never uniformly continuous. Because of this, every topological vector space can be completed and is thus a dense linear subspace of a complete topological vector space.

* Every TVS has a completion and every Hausdorff TVS has a Hausdorff completion. Every TVS (even those that are Hausdorff and/or complete) has infinitely many non-isomorphic non-Hausdorff completions.
* A compact subset of a TVS (not necessarily Hausdorff) is complete. A complete subset of a Hausdorff TVS is closed.
* If formula_165 is a complete subset of a TVS then any subset of formula_165 that is closed in formula_165 is complete.
* A Cauchy sequence in a Hausdorff TVS formula_9 is not necessarily relatively compact (that is, its closure in formula_9 is not necessarily compact).
* If a Cauchy filter in a TVS has an accumulation point formula_112 then it converges to formula_171
* If a series formula_172 converges in a TVS formula_9 then formula_174 in formula_13

==Examples==

===Finest and coarsest vector topology===

Let formula_9 be a real or complex vector space.

Trivial topology

The trivial topology or indiscrete topology formula_177 is always a TVS topology on any vector space formula_9 and it is the coarsest TVS topology possible. An important consequence of this is that the intersection of any collection of TVS topologies on formula_9 always contains a TVS topology. Any vector space (including those that are infinite dimensional) endowed with the trivial topology is a compact (and thus locally compact) complete pseudometrizable seminormable locally convex topological vector space. It is Hausdorff if and only if formula_180

Finest vector topology

There exists a TVS topology formula_181 on formula_8 called the on formula_8 that is finer than every other TVS-topology on formula_9 (that is, any TVS-topology on formula_9 is necessarily a subset of formula_181). Every linear map from formula_187 into another TVS is necessarily continuous. If formula_9 has an uncountable Hamel basis then formula_181 is locally convex and metrizable.

===Cartesian products===

A Cartesian product of a family of topological vector spaces, when endowed with the product topology, is a topological vector space. Consider for instance the set formula_9 of all functions formula_191 where formula_192 carries its usual Euclidean topology. This set formula_9 is a real vector space (where addition and scalar multiplication are defined pointwise, as usual) that can be identified with (and indeed, is often defined to be) the Cartesian product formula_194 which carries the natural product topology. With this product topology, formula_195 becomes a topological vector space whose topology is called The reason for this name is the following: if formula_196 is a sequence (or more generally, a net) of elements in formula_9 and if formula_198 then formula_199 converges to formula_200 in formula_9 if and only if for every real number formula_202 formula_203 converges to formula_204 in formula_205 This TVS is complete, Hausdorff, and locally convex but not metrizable and consequently not normable; indeed, every neighborhood of the origin in the product topology contains lines (that is, 1-dimensional vector subspaces, which are subsets of the form formula_206 with formula_207).

===Finite-dimensional spaces===

By F. Riesz&#x27;s theorem, a Hausdorff topological vector space is finite-dimensional if and only if it is locally compact, which happens if and only if it has a compact neighborhood of the origin.

Let formula_7 denote formula_192 or formula_1 and endow formula_7 with its usual Hausdorff normed Euclidean topology. Let formula_9 be a vector space over formula_7 of finite dimension formula_214 and so that formula_9 is vector space isomorphic to formula_153 (explicitly, this means that there exists a linear isomorphism between the vector spaces formula_9 and formula_153). This finite-dimensional vector space formula_9 always has a unique vector topology, which makes it TVS-isomorphic to formula_220 where formula_153 is endowed with the usual Euclidean topology (which is the same as the product topology). This Hausdorff vector topology is also the (unique) finest vector topology on formula_13 formula_9 has a unique vector topology if and only if formula_180 If formula_225 then although formula_9 does not have a unique vector topology, it does have a unique vector topology.

* If formula_227 then formula_228 has exactly one vector topology: the trivial topology, which in this case (and in this case) is Hausdorff. The trivial topology on a vector space is Hausdorff if and only if the vector space has dimension formula_229
* If formula_230 then formula_9 has two vector topologies: the usual Euclidean topology and the (non-Hausdorff) trivial topology.
** Since the field formula_7 is itself a formula_233-dimensional topological vector space over formula_7 and since it plays an important role in the definition of topological vector spaces, this dichotomy plays an important role in the definition of an absorbing set and has consequences that reverberate throughout functional analysis.

* If formula_235 then formula_9 has distinct vector topologies:
** Some of these topologies are now described: Every linear functional formula_200 on formula_8 which is vector space isomorphic to formula_220 induces a seminorm formula_240 defined by formula_241 where formula_242 Every seminorm induces a (pseudometrizable locally convex) vector topology on formula_9 and seminorms with distinct kernels induce distinct topologies so that in particular, seminorms on formula_9 that are induced by linear functionals with distinct kernels will induce distinct vector topologies on formula_13
** However, while there are infinitely many vector topologies on formula_9 when formula_247 there are, , only formula_248 vector topologies on formula_13 For instance, if formula_250 then the vector topologies on formula_9 consist of the trivial topology, the Hausdorff Euclidean topology, and then the infinitely many remaining non-trivial non-Euclidean vector topologies on formula_9 are all TVS-isomorphic to one another.

===Non-vector topologies===

Discrete and cofinite topologies

If formula_9 is a non-trivial vector space (that is, of non-zero dimension) then the discrete topology on formula_9 (which is always metrizable) is a TVS topology because despite making addition and negation continuous (which makes it into a topological group under addition), it fails to make scalar multiplication continuous. The cofinite topology on formula_9 (where a subset is open if and only if its complement is finite) is also a TVS topology on formula_13

==Linear maps==

A linear operator between two topological vector spaces which is continuous at one point is continuous on the whole domain. Moreover, a linear operator formula_200 is continuous if formula_258 is bounded (as defined below) for some neighborhood formula_9 of the origin.

A hyperplane in a topological vector space formula_9 is either dense or closed. A linear functional formula_200 on a topological vector space formula_9 has either dense or closed kernel. Moreover, formula_200 is continuous if and only if its kernel is closed.

==Types==

Depending on the application additional constraints are usually enforced on the topological structure of the space. In fact, several principal results in functional analysis fail to hold in general for topological vector spaces: the closed graph theorem, the open mapping theorem, and the fact that the dual space of the space separates points in the space.

Below are some common topological vector spaces, roughly in order of increasing &quot;niceness.&quot;

* F-spaces are complete topological vector spaces with a translation-invariant metric. These include formula_264 spaces for all formula_265
* Locally convex topological vector spaces: here each point has a local base consisting of convex sets. By a technique known as Minkowski functionals it can be shown that a space is locally convex if and only if its topology can be defined by a family of seminorms. Local convexity is the minimum requirement for &quot;geometrical&quot; arguments like the Hahn–Banach theorem. The formula_264 spaces are locally convex (in fact, Banach spaces) for all formula_267 but not for formula_268
* Barrelled spaces: locally convex spaces where the Banach–Steinhaus theorem holds.
* Bornological space: a locally convex space where the continuous linear operators to any locally convex space are exactly the bounded linear operators.
* Stereotype space: a locally convex space satisfying a variant of reflexivity condition, where the dual space is endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on totally bounded sets.
* Montel space: a barrelled space where every closed and bounded set is compact
* Fréchet spaces: these are complete locally convex spaces where the topology comes from a translation-invariant metric, or equivalently: from a countable family of seminorms. Many interesting spaces of functions fall into this class -- formula_269 is a Fréchet space under the seminorms formula_270 A locally convex F-space is a Fréchet space.
* LF-spaces are limits of Fréchet spaces. ILH spaces are inverse limits of Hilbert spaces.
* Nuclear spaces: these are locally convex spaces with the property that every bounded map from the nuclear space to an arbitrary Banach space is a nuclear operator.
* Normed spaces and seminormed spaces: locally convex spaces where the topology can be described by a single norm or seminorm. In normed spaces a linear operator is continuous if and only if it is bounded.
* Banach spaces: Complete normed vector spaces. Most of functional analysis is formulated for Banach spaces. This class includes the formula_264 spaces with formula_272 the space formula_273 of functions of bounded variation, and certain spaces of measures.
* Reflexive Banach spaces: Banach spaces naturally isomorphic to their double dual (see below), which ensures that some geometrical arguments can be carried out. An important example which is reflexive is formula_274, whose dual is formula_275 but is strictly contained in the dual of formula_276
* Hilbert spaces: these have an inner product; even though these spaces may be infinite-dimensional, most geometrical reasoning familiar from finite dimensions can be carried out in them. These include formula_277 spaces, the formula_277 Sobolev spaces formula_279 and Hardy spaces.
* Euclidean spaces: formula_280 or formula_281 with the topology induced by the standard inner product. As pointed out in the preceding section, for a given finite formula_282 there is only one formula_161-dimensional topological vector space, up to isomorphism. It follows from this that any finite-dimensional subspace of a TVS is closed. A characterization of finite dimensionality is that a Hausdorff TVS is locally compact if and only if it is finite-dimensional (therefore isomorphic to some Euclidean space).

==Dual space==

Every topological vector space has a continuous dual space—the set formula_284 of all continuous linear functionals, that is, continuous linear maps from the space into the base field formula_285 A topology on the dual can be defined to be the coarsest topology such that the dual pairing each point evaluation formula_286 is continuous. This turns the dual into a locally convex topological vector space. This topology is called the weak-* topology. This may not be the only natural topology on the dual space; for instance, the dual of a normed space has a natural norm defined on it. However, it is very important in applications because of its compactness properties (see Banach–Alaoglu theorem). Caution: Whenever formula_9 is a non-normable locally convex space, then the pairing map formula_288 is never continuous, no matter which vector space topology one chooses on formula_289 A topological vector space has a non-trivial continuous dual space if and only if it has a proper convex neighborhood of the origin.

==Properties==
For any formula_290 of a TVS formula_8 the &quot;convex&quot; (resp. &quot;balanced, disked, closed convex, closed balanced, closed disked&quot;&#x27;) &quot;hull&quot; of formula_114 is the smallest subset of formula_9 that has this property and contains formula_294 The closure (respectively, interior, convex hull, balanced hull, disked hull) of a set formula_114 is sometimes denoted by formula_296 (respectively, formula_297 formula_298 formula_299 formula_300).

The convex hull formula_301 of a subset formula_114 is equal to the set of all of elements in formula_303 which are finite linear combinations of the form formula_304 where formula_305 is an integer, formula_306 and formula_307 sum to formula_308 The intersection of any family of convex sets is convex and the convex hull of a subset is equal to the intersection of all convex sets that contain it.

===Neighborhoods and open sets===

Properties of neighborhoods and open sets

Every TVS is connected and locally connected and any connected open subset of a TVS is arcwise connected. If formula_290 and formula_51 is an open subset of formula_9 then formula_312 is an open set in formula_9 and if formula_290 has non-empty interior then formula_315 is a neighborhood of the origin.

The open convex subsets of a TVS formula_9 (not necessarily Hausdorff or locally convex) are exactly those that are of the form formula_317 for some formula_318 and some positive continuous sublinear functional formula_144 on formula_13

If formula_321 is an absorbing disk in a TVS formula_9 and if formula_323 is the Minkowski functional of formula_321 then formula_325 where importantly, it was assumed that formula_321 had any topological properties nor that formula_144 was continuous (which happens if and only if formula_321 is a neighborhood of the origin).

Let formula_156 and formula_330 be two vector topologies on formula_13 Then formula_332 if and only if whenever a net formula_158 in formula_9 converges formula_130 in formula_336 then formula_174 in formula_338

Let formula_25 be a neighborhood basis of the origin in formula_8 let formula_108 and let formula_342 Then formula_343 if and only if there exists a net formula_344 in formula_114 (indexed by formula_25) such that formula_347 in formula_13 This shows, in particular, that it will often suffice to consider nets indexed by a neighborhood basis of the origin rather than nets on arbitrary directed sets.

If formula_9 is a TVS that is of the second category in itself (that is, a nonmeager space) then any closed convex absorbing subset of formula_9 is a neighborhood of the origin. This is no longer guaranteed if the set is not convex (a counter-example exists even in formula_351) or if formula_9 is not of the second category in itself.

Interior

If formula_353 and formula_114 has non-empty interior then 
formula_355
and
formula_356

The topological interior of a disk is not empty if and only if this interior contains the origin. 
More generally, if formula_114 is a balanced set with non-empty interior formula_358 in a TVS formula_9 then formula_360 will necessarily be balanced; consequently, formula_361 will be balanced if and only if it contains the origin. For this (i.e. formula_362) to be true, it suffices for formula_114 to also be convex (in addition to being balanced and having non-empty interior).; 
The conclusion formula_362 could be false if formula_114 is not also convex; for example, in formula_366 the interior of the closed and balanced set formula_367 is formula_368

If formula_165 is convex and formula_370 then formula_371 
Explicitly, this means that if formula_165 is a convex subset of a TVS formula_9 (not necessarily Hausdorff or locally convex), formula_374 and formula_375 then the open line segment joining formula_112 and formula_377 belongs to the interior of formula_378 that is, formula_379

If formula_380 is any balanced neighborhood of the origin in formula_9 then formula_382 where formula_383 is the set of all scalars formula_384 such that formula_385

If formula_112 belongs to the interior of a convex set formula_290 and formula_388 then the half-open line segment formula_389 and formula_390 
If formula_391 is a balanced neighborhood of formula_130 in formula_9 and formula_394 then by considering intersections of the form formula_395 (which are convex symmetric neighborhoods of formula_130 in the real TVS formula_397) it follows that: formula_398 and furthermore, if formula_399 then formula_400 and if formula_401 then formula_402

===Non-Hausdorff spaces and the closure of the origin===

A topological vector space formula_9 is Hausdorff if and only if formula_404 is a closed subset of formula_8 or equivalently, if and only if formula_406 Because formula_404 is a vector subspace of formula_8 the same is true of its closure formula_409 which is referred to as in formula_13 This vector space satisfies formula_411 so that in particular, every neighborhood of the origin in formula_9 contains the vector space formula_413 as a subset. 
The subspace topology on formula_413 is always the trivial topology, which in particular implies that the topological vector space formula_413 a compact space (even if its dimension is non-zero or even infinite) and consequently also a bounded subset of formula_13 In fact, a vector subspace of a TVS is bounded if and only if it is contained in the closure of formula_94 
Every subset of formula_413 also carries the trivial topology and so is itself a compact, and thus also complete, subspace (see footnote for a proof). In particular, if formula_9 is not Hausdorff then there exist subsets that are both but in formula_9; for instance, this will be true of any non-empty proper subset of formula_421

If formula_290 is compact, then formula_423 and this set is compact. Thus the closure of a compact subset of a TVS is compact (said differently, all compact sets are relatively compact), which is not guaranteed for arbitrary non-Hausdorff topological spaces.

For every subset formula_108 formula_425 and consequently, if formula_290 is open or closed in formula_9 then formula_428 (so that this open closed subsets formula_114 can be described as a &quot;tube&quot; whose vertical side is the vector space formula_413). 
For any subset formula_290 of this TVS formula_8 the following are equivalent:

* formula_114 is totally bounded.
* formula_434 is totally bounded.
* formula_296 is totally bounded.
* The image if formula_114 under the canonical quotient map formula_437 is totally bounded.

If formula_90 is a vector subspace of a TVS formula_9 then formula_89 is Hausdorff if and only if formula_90 is closed in formula_13 
Moreover, the quotient map formula_443 is always a closed map onto the (necessarily) Hausdorff TVS.

Every vector subspace of formula_9 that is an algebraic complement of formula_413 (that is, a vector subspace formula_446 that satisfies formula_447 and formula_448) is a topological complement of formula_421 
Consequently, if formula_446 is an algebraic complement of formula_413 in formula_9 then the addition map formula_453 defined by formula_454 is a TVS-isomorphism, where formula_446 is necessarily Hausdorff and formula_413 has the indiscrete topology. Moreover, if formula_165 is a Hausdorff completion of formula_446 then formula_459 is a completion of formula_460

===Closed and compact sets===

Compact and totally bounded sets

A subset of a TVS is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded. Thus, in a complete topological vector space, a closed and totally bounded subset is compact. 
A subset formula_114 of a TVS formula_9 is totally bounded if and only if formula_296 is totally bounded, if and only if its image under the canonical quotient map formula_464 is totally bounded.

Every relatively compact set is totally bounded and the closure of a totally bounded set is totally bounded. 
The image of a totally bounded set under a uniformly continuous map (such as a continuous linear map for instance) is totally bounded. 
If formula_114 is a subset of a TVS formula_9 such that every sequence in formula_114 has a cluster point in formula_114 then formula_114 is totally bounded.

If formula_321 is a compact subset of a TVS formula_9 and formula_51 is an open subset of formula_9 containing formula_474 then there exists a neighborhood formula_391 of 0 such that formula_476

Closure and closed set

The closure of any convex (respectively, any balanced, any absorbing) subset of any TVS has this same property. In particular, the closure of any convex, balanced, and absorbing subset is a barrel.

The closure of a vector subspace of a TVS is a vector subspace. Every finite dimensional vector subspace of a Hausdorff TVS is closed. 
The sum of a closed vector subspace and a finite-dimensional vector subspace is closed. 
If formula_90 is a vector subspace of formula_9 and formula_391 is a closed neighborhood of the origin in formula_9 such that formula_481 is closed in formula_9 then formula_90 is closed in formula_13 
The sum of a compact set and a closed set is closed. However, the sum of two closed subsets may fail to be closed (see this footnote for examples). 

If formula_290 and formula_384 is a scalar then formula_487 where if formula_9 is Hausdorff, formula_489 then equality holds: formula_490 In particular, every non-zero scalar multiple of a closed set is closed. 
If formula_290 and if formula_492 is a set of scalars such that neither formula_493 contain zero then formula_494

If formula_495 then formula_296 is convex.

If formula_353 then formula_498 and so consequently, if formula_499 is closed then so is formula_500

If formula_9 is a real TVS and formula_108 then formula_503 where the left hand side is independent of the topology on formula_504 moreover, if formula_114 is a convex neighborhood of the origin then equality holds.

For any subset formula_108 formula_507 where formula_25 is any neighborhood basis at the origin for formula_13 
However, formula_510 and it is possible for this containment to be proper (for example, if formula_511 and formula_114 is the rational numbers). It follows that formula_513 for every neighborhood formula_51 of the origin in formula_13

Closed hulls

In a locally convex space, convex hulls of bounded sets are bounded. This is not true for TVSs in general.

* The closed convex hull of a set is equal to the closure of the convex hull of that set; that is, equal to formula_516
* The closed balanced hull of a set is equal to the closure of the balanced hull of that set; that is, equal to formula_517
* The closed disked hull of a set is equal to the closure of the disked hull of that set; that is, equal to formula_518

If formula_353 and the closed convex hull of one of the sets formula_114 or formula_521 is compact then formula_522 
If formula_353 each have a closed convex hull that is compact (that is, formula_524 and formula_525 are compact) then formula_526

Hulls and compactness

In a general TVS, the closed convex hull of a compact set may to be compact. 
The balanced hull of a compact (respectively, totally bounded) set has that same property. 
The convex hull of a finite union of compact sets is again compact and convex.

===Other properties===

Meager, nowhere dense, and Baire

A disk in a TVS is not nowhere dense if and only if its closure is a neighborhood of the origin. 
A vector subspace of a TVS that is closed but not open is nowhere dense.

Suppose formula_9 is a TVS that does not carry the indiscrete topology. Then formula_9 is a Baire space if and only if formula_9 has no balanced absorbing nowhere dense subset.

A TVS formula_9 is a Baire space if and only if formula_9 is nonmeager, which happens if and only if there does not exist a nowhere dense set formula_532 such that formula_533 
Every nonmeager locally convex TVS is a barrelled space.

Important algebraic facts and common misconceptions

If formula_290 then formula_535; if formula_114 is convex then equality holds. For an example where equality does hold, let formula_112 be non-zero and set formula_538 formula_539 also works.

A subset formula_165 is convex if and only if formula_541 for all positive real formula_542 or equivalently, if and only if formula_543 for all formula_126

The convex balanced hull of a set formula_290 is equal to the convex hull of the balanced hull of formula_546 that is, it is equal to formula_547 But in general, formula_548 where the inclusion might be strict since the balanced hull of a convex set need not be convex (counter-examples exist even in formula_549).

If formula_353 and formula_384 is a scalar then formula_552 
If formula_353 are convex non-empty disjoint sets and formula_554 then formula_555 or formula_556

In any non-trivial vector space formula_8 there exist two disjoint non-empty convex subsets whose union is formula_13

Other properties

Every TVS topology can be generated by a of &quot;F&quot;-seminorms. 
If formula_559 is some unary predicate (a true or false statement dependent on formula_107) then for any formula_561 formula_562 
So for example, if formula_559 denotes &quot;formula_564&quot; then for any formula_561 formula_566 Similarly, if formula_101 is a scalar then formula_568 The elements formula_107 of these sets must range over a vector space (that is, over formula_9) rather than not just a subset or else these equalities are no longer guaranteed; similarly, formula_571 must belong to this vector space (that is, formula_318).

===Properties preserved by set operators===

* The balanced hull of a compact (respectively, totally bounded, open) set has that same property.
* The (Minkowski) sum of two compact (respectively, bounded, balanced, convex) sets has that same property. But the sum of two closed sets need be closed.
* The convex hull of a balanced (resp. open) set is balanced (respectively, open). However, the convex hull of a closed set need be closed. And the convex hull of a bounded set need be bounded.

The following table, the color of each cell indicates whether or not a given property of subsets of formula_9 (indicated by the column name, &quot;convex&quot; for instance) is preserved under the set operator (indicated by the row&#x27;s name, &quot;closure&quot; for instance). If in every TVS, a property is preserved under the indicated set operator then that cell will be colored green; otherwise, it will be colored red.

So for instance, since the union of two absorbing sets is again absorbing, the cell in row &quot;formula_574&quot; and column &quot;Absorbing&quot; is colored green. But since the arbitrary intersection of absorbing sets need not be absorbing, the cell in row &quot;Arbitrary intersections (of at least 1 set)&quot; and column &quot;Absorbing&quot; is colored red. If a cell is not colored then that information has yet to be filled in.

<text>Where Mathematics Comes From: How the Embodied Mind Brings Mathematics into Being (hereinafter &quot;WMCF&quot;) is a book by George Lakoff, a cognitive linguist, and Rafael E. Núñez, a psychologist. Published in 2000, &quot;WMCF&quot; seeks to found a cognitive science of mathematics, a theory of embodied mathematics based on conceptual metaphor.

==&quot;WMCF&quot; definition of mathematics==
Mathematics makes up that part of the human conceptual system that is special in the following way:
:It is precise, consistent, stable across time and human communities, symbolizable, calculable, generalizable, universally available, consistent within each of its subject matters, and effective as a general tool for description, explanation, and prediction in a vast number of everyday activities, [ranging from] sports, to building, business, technology, and science. - &quot;WMCF&quot;, pp. 50, 377

Nikolay Lobachevsky said &quot;There is no branch of mathematics, however abstract, which may not some day be applied to phenomena of the real world.&quot; A common type of conceptual blending process would seem to apply to the entire mathematical procession.

== Human cognition and mathematics ==
Lakoff and Núñez&#x27;s avowed purpose is to begin laying the foundations for a truly scientific understanding of mathematics, one grounded in processes common to all human cognition. They find that four distinct but related processes metaphorically structure basic arithmetic: object collection, object construction, using a measuring stick, and moving along a path.

&quot;WMCF&quot; builds on earlier books by Lakoff (1987) and Lakoff and Johnson (1980, 1999), which analyze such concepts of metaphor and image schemata from second-generation cognitive science. Some of the concepts in these earlier books, such as the interesting technical ideas in Lakoff (1987), are absent from &quot;WMCF&quot;.

Lakoff and Núñez hold that mathematics results from the human cognitive apparatus and must therefore be understood in cognitive terms. &quot;WMCF&quot; advocates (and includes some examples of) a &quot;cognitive idea analysis&quot; of mathematics which analyzes mathematical ideas in terms of the human experiences, metaphors, generalizations, and other cognitive mechanisms giving rise to them. A standard mathematical education does not develop such idea analysis techniques because it does not pursue considerations of A) what structures of the mind allow it to do mathematics or B) the philosophy of mathematics.

Lakoff and Núñez start by reviewing the psychological literature, concluding that human beings appear to have an innate ability, called subitizing, to count, add, and subtract up to about 4 or 5. They document this conclusion by reviewing the literature, published in recent decades, describing experiments with infant subjects. For example, infants quickly become excited or curious when presented with &quot;impossible&quot; situations, such as having three toys appear when only two were initially present.

The authors argue that mathematics goes far beyond this very elementary level due to a large number of metaphorical constructions. For example, the Pythagorean position that all is number, and the associated crisis of confidence that came about with the discovery of the irrationality of the square root of two, arises solely from a metaphorical relation between the length of the diagonal of a square, and the possible numbers of objects.

Much of &quot;WMCF&quot; deals with the important concepts of infinity and of limit processes, seeking to explain how finite humans living in a finite world could ultimately conceive of the actual infinite. Thus much of &quot;WMCF&quot; is, in effect, a study of the epistemological foundations of the calculus. Lakoff and Núñez conclude that while the potential infinite is not metaphorical, the actual infinite is. Moreover, they deem all manifestations of actual infinity to be instances of what they call the &quot;Basic Metaphor of Infinity&quot;, as represented by the ever-increasing sequence 1, 2, 3, ...

&quot;WMCF&quot; emphatically rejects the Platonistic philosophy of mathematics. They emphasize that all we know and can ever know is &quot;human mathematics&quot;, the mathematics arising from the human intellect. The question of whether there is a &quot;transcendent&quot; mathematics independent of human thought is a meaningless question, like asking if colors are transcendent of human thought—colors are only varying wavelengths of light, it is our interpretation of physical stimuli that make them colors.

&quot;WMCF&quot; (p. 81) likewise criticizes the emphasis mathematicians place on the concept of closure. Lakoff and Núñez argue that the expectation of closure is an artifact of the human mind&#x27;s ability to relate fundamentally different concepts via metaphor.

&quot;WMCF&quot; concerns itself mainly with proposing and establishing an alternative view of mathematics, one grounding the field in the realities of human biology and experience. It is not a work of technical mathematics or philosophy. Lakoff and Núñez are not the first to argue that conventional approaches to the philosophy of mathematics are flawed. For example, they do not seem all that familiar with the content of Davis and Hersh (1981), even though the book warmly acknowledges Hersh&#x27;s support.

Lakoff and Núñez cite Saunders Mac Lane (the inventor, with Samuel Eilenberg, of category theory) in support of their position. &quot;Mathematics, Form and Function&quot; (1986), an overview of mathematics intended for philosophers, proposes that mathematical concepts are ultimately grounded in ordinary human activities, mostly interactions with the physical world.

==Examples of mathematical metaphors==
Conceptual metaphors described in &quot;WMCF&quot;, in addition to the Basic Metaphor of Infinity, include:
*Arithmetic is motion along a path, object collection/construction;
*Change is motion;
*Sets are containers, objects;
*Continuity is gapless;
*Mathematical systems have an &quot;essence,&quot; namely their axiomatic algebraic structure;
*Functions are sets of ordered pairs, curves in the Cartesian plane;
*Geometric figures are objects in space;
*Logical independence is geometric orthogonality;
*Numbers are sets, object collections, physical segments, points on a line;
*Recurrence is circular.
Mathematical reasoning requires variables ranging over some universe of discourse, so that we can reason about generalities rather than merely about particulars. &quot;WMCF&quot; argues that reasoning with such variables implicitly relies on what it terms the Fundamental Metonymy of Algebra.

==Example of metaphorical ambiguity==
&quot;WMCF&quot; (p. 151) includes the following example of what the authors term &quot;metaphorical ambiguity.&quot; Take the set formula_1 Then recall two bits of standard terminology from elementary set theory:
#The recursive construction of the ordinal natural numbers, whereby 0 is formula_2, and formula_3 is formula_4
#The ordered pair (&quot;a,b&quot;), defined as formula_5
By (1), &quot;A&quot; is the set {1,2}. But (1) and (2) together say that &quot;A&quot; is also the ordered pair (0,1). Both statements cannot be correct; the ordered pair (0,1) and the unordered pair {1,2} are fully distinct concepts. Lakoff and Johnson (1999) term this situation &quot;metaphorically ambiguous.&quot; This simple example calls into question any Platonistic foundations for mathematics.

While (1) and (2) above are admittedly canonical, especially within the consensus set theory known as the Zermelo–Fraenkel axiomatization, &quot;WMCF&quot; does not let on that they are but one of several definitions that have been proposed since the dawning of set theory. For example, Frege, &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, and New Foundations (a body of axiomatic set theory begun by Quine in 1937) define cardinals and ordinals as equivalence classes under the relations of equinumerosity and similarity, so that this conundrum does not arise. In Quinian set theory, &quot;A&quot; is simply an instance of the number 2. For technical reasons, defining the ordered pair as in (2) above is awkward in Quinian set theory. Two solutions have been proposed:
*A variant set-theoretic definition of the ordered pair more complicated than the usual one;
*Taking ordered pairs as primitive.

==The Romance of Mathematics==
The &quot;Romance of Mathematics&quot; is &quot;WMCF&quot;″s light-hearted term for a perennial philosophical viewpoint about mathematics which the authors describe and then dismiss as an intellectual myth:
* Mathematics is transcendent, namely it exists independently of human beings, and structures our actual physical universe and any possible universe. Mathematics is the language of nature, and is the primary conceptual structure we would have in common with extraterrestrial aliens, if any such there be.
*Mathematical proof is the gateway to a realm of transcendent truth.
* Reasoning is logic, and logic is essentially mathematical. Hence mathematics structures all possible reasoning.
* Because mathematics exists independently of human beings, and reasoning is essentially mathematical, reason itself is disembodied. Therefore, artificial intelligence is possible, at least in principle.

It is very much an open question whether &quot;WMCF&quot; will eventually prove to be the start of a new school in the philosophy of mathematics. Hence the main value of &quot;WMCF&quot; so far may be a critical one: its critique of Platonism and romanticism in mathematics.

== Critical response ==
Many working mathematicians resist the approach and conclusions of Lakoff and Núñez. Reviews of &quot;WMCF&quot; by mathematicians in professional journals, while often respectful of its focus on conceptual strategies and metaphors as paths for understanding mathematics, have taken exception to some of the &quot;WMCF&quot;″s philosophical arguments on the grounds that mathematical statements have lasting &#x27;objective&#x27; meanings. For example, Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem means exactly what it meant when Fermat initially proposed it in 1664. Other reviewers have pointed out that multiple conceptual strategies can be employed in connection with the same mathematically defined term, often by the same person (a point that is compatible with the view that we routinely understand the &#x27;same&#x27; concept with different metaphors). The metaphor and the conceptual strategy are not the same as the formal definition which mathematicians employ. However, &quot;WMCF&quot; points out that formal definitions are built using words and symbols that have meaning only in terms of human experience.

Critiques of &quot;WMCF&quot; include the humorous:

and the physically informed:

Lakoff and Núñez tend to dismiss the negative opinions mathematicians have expressed about &quot;WMCF&quot;, because their critics do not appreciate the insights of cognitive science. Lakoff and Núñez maintain that their argument can only be understood using the discoveries of recent decades about the way human brains process language and meaning. They argue that any arguments or criticisms that are not grounded in this understanding cannot address the content of the book.

It has been pointed out that it is not at all clear that &quot;WMCF&quot; establishes that the claim &quot;intelligent alien life would have mathematical ability&quot; is a myth. To do this, it would be required to show that intelligence and mathematical ability are separable, and this has not been done. On Earth, intelligence and mathematical ability seem to go hand in hand in all life-forms, as pointed out by Keith Devlin among others. The authors of &quot;WMCF&quot; have not explained how this situation would (or even could) be different anywhere else.

Lakoff and Núñez also appear not to appreciate the extent to which intuitionists and constructivists have presaged their attack on the Romance of (Platonic) Mathematics. Brouwer, the founder of the intuitionist/constructivist point of view, in his dissertation &quot;On the Foundation of Mathematics&quot;, argued that mathematics was a mental construction, a free creation of the mind and totally independent of logic and language. He goes on to criticize the formalists for building verbal structures that are studied without intuitive interpretation. Symbolic language should not be confused with mathematics; it reflects, but does not contain, mathematical reality.

Educators have taken some interest in what &quot;WMCF&quot; suggests about how mathematics is learned, and why students find some elementary concepts more difficult than others.

However, even from an educational perspective, WMCF is still problematic. From the conceptual metaphor theory&#x27;s point of view, metaphors reside in a different realm, the abstract, from that of &#x27;real world&#x27;, the concrete. In other words, despite their claim of mathematics being human,  established mathematical knowledge — which is what we learn in school — is assumed to be and treated as abstract, completely detached from its physical origin. It cannot account for the way learners could access to such knowledge.

WMCF is also criticized for its monist approach. First, it ignores the fact that the sensori-motor experience upon which our linguistic structure — thus, mathematics — is assumed to be based may vary across cultures and situations. Second, the mathematics WMCF is concerned with is &quot;almost entirely... standard utterances in textbooks and curricula&quot;, which is the most-well established body of knowledge. It is negligent of the dynamic and diverse nature of the history of mathematics.

WMCF&#x27;s logo-centric approach is another target for critics. While it is predominantly interested in the association between language and mathematics, it does not account for how non-linguistic factors contribute to the emergence of mathematical ideas (e.g. See Radford, 2009; Rotman, 2008).

==Summing up==
&quot;WMCF&quot; (pp. 378–79) concludes with some key points, a number of which follow. Mathematics arises from our bodies and brains, our everyday experiences, and the concerns of human societies and cultures. It is:
*The result of normal adult cognitive capacities, in particular the capacity for conceptual metaphor, and as such is a human universal. The ability to construct conceptual metaphors is neurologically based, and enables humans to reason about one domain using the language and concepts of another domain. Conceptual metaphor is both what enabled mathematics to grow out of everyday activities, and what enables mathematics to grow by a continual process of analogy and abstraction;
*Symbolic, thereby enormously facilitating precise calculation;
*Not transcendent, but the result of human evolution and culture, to which it owes its effectiveness. During experience of the world a connection to mathematical ideas is going on within the human mind;
*A system of human concepts making extraordinary use of the ordinary tools of human cognition;
*An open-ended creation of human beings, who remain responsible for maintaining and extending it;
*One of the greatest products of the collective human imagination, and a magnificent example of the beauty, richness, complexity, diversity, and importance of human ideas.

The cognitive approach to formal systems, as described and implemented in &quot;WMCF&quot;, need not be confined to mathematics, but should also prove fruitful when applied to formal logic, and to formal philosophy such as Edward Zalta&#x27;s theory of abstract objects. Lakoff and Johnson (1999) fruitfully employ the cognitive approach to rethink a good deal of the philosophy of mind, epistemology, metaphysics, and the history of ideas.

<text>The mineral pyrite ( ), or iron pyrite, also known as fool&#x27;s gold, is an iron sulfide with the chemical formula FeS2 (iron (II) disulfide). Pyrite is the most abundant sulfide mineral.

Pyrite&#x27;s metallic luster and pale brass-yellow hue give it a superficial resemblance to gold, hence the well-known nickname of &quot;fool&#x27;s gold&quot;. The color has also led to the nicknames &quot;brass&quot;, &quot;brazzle&quot;, and &quot;brazil&quot;, primarily used to refer to pyrite found in coal.

The name &quot;pyrite&quot; is derived from the Greek (), &#x27;stone or mineral which strikes fire&#x27;, in turn from (), &#x27;fire&#x27;. In ancient Roman times, this name was applied to several types of stone that would create sparks when struck against steel; Pliny the Elder described one of them as being brassy, almost certainly a reference to what is now called pyrite.

By Georgius Agricola&#x27;s time, , the term had become a generic term for all of the sulfide minerals.
Pyrite is usually found associated with other sulfides or oxides in quartz veins, sedimentary rock, and metamorphic rock, as well as in coal beds and as a replacement mineral in fossils, but has also been identified in the sclerites of scaly-foot gastropods. Despite being nicknamed &quot;fool&#x27;s gold&quot;, pyrite is sometimes found in association with small quantities of gold. A substantial proportion of the gold is &quot;invisible gold&quot; incorporated into the pyrite (see Carlin-type gold deposit). It has been suggested that the presence of both gold and arsenic is a case of coupled substitution but as of 1997 the chemical state of the gold remained controversial.

== Uses ==
Pyrite gained a brief popularity in the 16th and 17th centuries as a source of ignition in early firearms, most notably the wheellock, where a sample of pyrite was placed against a circular file to strike the sparks needed to fire the gun.

Pyrite is used with flintstone and a form of tinder made of stringybark by the Kaurna people of South Australia, as a traditional method of starting fires.

Pyrite has been used since classical times to manufacture &quot;copperas&quot; (ferrous sulfate). Iron pyrite was heaped up and allowed to weather (an example of an early form of heap leaching). The acidic runoff from the heap was then boiled with iron to produce iron sulfate. In the 15th century, new methods of such leaching began to replace the burning of sulfur as a source of sulfuric acid. By the 19th century, it had become the dominant method.

Pyrite remains in commercial use for the production of sulfur dioxide, for use in such applications as the paper industry, and in the manufacture of sulfuric acid. Thermal decomposition of pyrite into FeS (iron(II) sulfide) and elemental sulfur starts at ; at around , &quot;p&quot;S2 is about .

A newer commercial use for pyrite is as the cathode material in Energizer brand non-rechargeable lithium metal batteries.

Pyrite is a semiconductor material with a band gap of 0.95 eV. Pure pyrite is naturally n-type, in both crystal and thin-film forms, potentially due to sulfur vacancies in the pyrite crystal structure acting as n-dopants.

During the early years of the 20th century, pyrite was used as a mineral detector in radio receivers, and is still used by crystal radio hobbyists. Until the vacuum tube matured, the crystal detector was the most sensitive and dependable detector available—with considerable variation between mineral types and even individual samples within a particular type of mineral. Pyrite detectors occupied a midway point between galena detectors and the more mechanically complicated perikon mineral pairs. Pyrite detectors can be as sensitive as a modern 1N34A germanium diode detector.

Pyrite has been proposed as an abundant, non-toxic, inexpensive material in low-cost photovoltaic solar panels. Synthetic iron sulfide was used with copper sulfide to create the photovoltaic material. More recent efforts are working toward thin-film solar cells made entirely of pyrite.

Pyrite is used to make marcasite jewelry. Marcasite jewelry, using small faceted pieces of pyrite, often set in silver, has been made since ancient times and was popular in the Victorian era. At the time when the term became common in jewelry making, &quot;marcasite&quot; referred to all iron sulfides including pyrite, and not to the orthorhombic FeS2 mineral marcasite which is lighter in color, brittle and chemically unstable, and thus not suitable for jewelry making. Marcasite jewelry does not actually contain the mineral marcasite. The specimens of pyrite, when it appears as good quality crystals, are used in decoration. They are also very popular in mineral collecting. Among the sites that provide the best specimens are Soria and La Rioja provinces (Spain).

In value terms, China ($47 million) constitutes the largest market for imported unroasted iron pyrites worldwide, making up 65% of global imports. China is also the fastest growing in terms of the unroasted iron pyrites imports, with a CAGR of +27.8% from 2007 to 2016.

==Research==
In July 2020 scientists reported that they have observed a voltage-induced transformation of normally diamagnetic pyrite into a ferromagnetic material, which may lead to applications in devices such as solar cells or magnetic data storage.

Researchers at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland have demonstrated that FeS2 can be exfoliated into few-layers just like other two-dimensional layered materials such as graphene by a simple liquid-phase exfoliation route. This is the first study to demonstrate the production of non-layered 2D-platelets from 3D bulk FeS2. Furthermore, they have used these 2D-platelets with 20% single walled carbon-nanotube as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries, reaching a capacity of 1000 mAh/g close to the theoretical capacity of FeS2.

In 2021, a natural pyrite stone has been crushed and pre-treated followed by liquid-phase exfoliation into two-dimensional nanosheets, which has shown capacities of 1200 mAh/g as an anode in lithium-ion batteries.

==Formal oxidation states for pyrite, marcasite, molybdenite and arsenopyrite==

From the perspective of classical inorganic chemistry, which assigns formal oxidation states to each atom, pyrite and marcasite are probably best described as Fe2+[S2]2−. This formalism recognizes that the sulfur atoms in pyrite occur in pairs with clear S–S bonds. These persulfide [–S–S–] units can be viewed as derived from hydrogen disulfide, H2S2. Thus pyrite would be more descriptively called iron persulfide, not iron disulfide. In contrast, molybdenite, MoS2, features isolated sulfide S2− centers and the oxidation state of molybdenum is Mo4+. The mineral arsenopyrite has the formula FeAsS. Whereas pyrite has [S2]2– units, arsenopyrite has [AsS]3– units, formally derived from deprotonation of arsenothiol (H2AsSH). Analysis of classical oxidation states would recommend the description of arsenopyrite as Fe3+[AsS]3−.

==Crystallography==
Iron-pyrite FeS2 represents the prototype compound of the crystallographic pyrite structure. The structure is cubic and was among the first crystal structures solved by X-ray diffraction. It belongs to the crystallographic space group &quot;Pa&quot; and is denoted by the Strukturbericht notation C2. Under thermodynamic standard conditions the lattice constant formula_1 of stoichiometric iron pyrite FeS2 amounts to . The unit cell is composed of a Fe face-centered cubic sublattice into which the ions are embedded. (Note though that the iron atoms in the faces are not equivalent by translation alone to the iron atoms at the corners.) The pyrite structure is also seen in other &quot;MX&quot;2 compounds of transition metals &quot;M&quot; and chalcogens &quot;X&quot; = O, S, Se and Te. Certain dipnictides with &quot;X&quot; standing for P, As and Sb etc. are also known to adopt the pyrite structure.

The Fe atoms are bonded to six S atoms, giving a distorted octahedron. The material is a semiconductor. The Fe ions are usually considered to be &quot;low spin&quot; divalent state (as shown by Mössbauer spectroscopy as well as XPS). The material as a whole behaves as a Van Vleck paramagnet, despite its low-spin divalency.

The sulfur centers occur in pairs, described as S22−. Reduction of pyrite with potassium gives potassium dithioferrate, KFeS2. This material features ferric ions and isolated sulfide (S2-) centers.

The S atoms are tetrahedral, being bonded to three Fe centers and one other S atom. The site symmetry at Fe and S positions is accounted for by point symmetry groups &quot;C&quot;3&quot;i&quot; and &quot;C&quot;3, respectively. The missing center of inversion at S lattice sites has important consequences for the crystallographic and physical properties of iron pyrite. These consequences derive from the crystal electric field active at the sulfur lattice site, which causes a polarization of S ions in the pyrite lattice. The polarisation can be calculated on the basis of higher-order Madelung constants and has to be included in the calculation of the lattice energy by using a generalised Born–Haber cycle. This reflects the fact that the covalent bond in the sulfur pair is inadequately accounted for by a strictly ionic treatment.

Arsenopyrite has a related structure with heteroatomic As–S pairs rather than S-S pairs. Marcasite also possesses homoatomic anion pairs, but the arrangement of the metal and diatomic anions differs from that of pyrite. Despite its name, chalcopyrite () does not contain dianion pairs, but single S2− sulfide anions.

==Crystal habit==

Pyrite usually forms cuboid crystals, sometimes forming in close association to form raspberry-shaped masses called framboids. However, under certain circumstances, it can form anastomosing filaments or T-shaped crystals.
Pyrite can also form shapes almost the same as a regular dodecahedron, known as pyritohedra, and this suggests an explanation for the artificial geometrical models found in Europe as early as the 5th century BC.

==Varieties==
Cattierite (CoS2), vaesite (NiS2) and hauerite (MnS2), as well as sperrylite (PtAs2) are similar in their structure and belong also to the pyrite group.

 is a nickel-cobalt bearing variety of pyrite, with &gt; 50% substitution of Ni2+ for Fe2+ within pyrite. Bravoite is not a formally recognised mineral, and is named after the Peruvian scientist Jose J. Bravo (1874–1928).

==Distinguishing similar minerals==
Pyrite is distinguishable from native gold by its hardness, brittleness and crystal form. Pyrite fractures are very uneven, sometimes conchoidal because it does not cleave along a preferential plane. Native gold nuggets, or glitters, do not break but deform in a ductile way. Pyrite is brittle, gold is malleable.

Natural gold tends to be anhedral (irregularly shaped without well defined faces), whereas pyrite comes as either cubes or multifaceted crystals with well developed and sharp faces easy to recognise. Well crystallised pyrite crystals are euhedral (&quot;i.e.&quot;, with nice faces). Pyrite can often be distinguished by the striations which, in many cases, can be seen on its surface. Chalcopyrite () is brighter yellow with a greenish hue when wet and is softer (3.5–4 on Mohs&#x27; scale). Arsenopyrite (FeAsS) is silver white and does not become more yellow when wet.

Iron pyrite is unstable when exposed to the oxidizing conditions prevailing at the Earth&#x27;s surface: iron pyrite in contact with atmospheric oxygen and water, or damp, ultimately decomposes into iron oxyhydroxides (ferrihydrite, FeO(OH)) and sulfuric acid (). This process is accelerated by the action of &quot;Acidithiobacillus&quot; bacteria which oxidize pyrite to first produce ferrous ions (), sulfate ions (), and release protons (, or ). In a second step, the ferrous ions () are oxidized by into ferric ions () which hydrolyze also releasing ions and producing FeO(OH). These oxidation reactions occur more rapidly when pyrite is finely dispersed (framboidal crystals initially formed by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) in argillaceous sediments or dust from mining operations).

===Pyrite oxidation and acid mine drainage===

Pyrite oxidation by atmospheric in the presence of moisture () initially produces ferrous ions () and sulfuric acid which dissociates into sulfate ions and protons, leading to acid mine drainage (AMD). An example of acid rock drainage caused by pyrite is the 2015 Gold King Mine waste water spill.

===Dust explosions===
Pyrite oxidation is sufficiently exothermic that underground coal mines in high-sulfur coal seams have occasionally had serious problems with spontaneous combustion. The solution is the use of buffer blasting and the use of various sealing or cladding agents to hermetically seal the mined-out areas to exclude oxygen.

In modern coal mines, limestone dust is sprayed onto the exposed coal surfaces to reduce the hazard of dust explosions. This has the secondary benefit of neutralizing the acid released by pyrite oxidation and therefore slowing the oxidation cycle described above, thus reducing the likelihood of spontaneous combustion. In the long term, however, oxidation continues, and the hydrated sulfates formed may exert crystallization pressure that can expand cracks in the rock and lead eventually to roof fall.

===Weakened building materials===

Building stone containing pyrite tends to stain brown as pyrite oxidizes. This problem appears to be significantly worse if any marcasite is present. The presence of pyrite in the aggregate used to make concrete can lead to severe deterioration as pyrite oxidizes. In early 2009, problems with Chinese drywall imported into the United States after Hurricane Katrina were attributed to pyrite oxidation, followed by microbial sulfate reduction which released hydrogen sulfide gas (). These problems included a foul odor and corrosion of copper wiring. In the United States, in Canada, and more recently in Ireland, where it was used as underfloor infill, pyrite contamination has caused major structural damage. Concrete exposed to sulfate ions, or sulfuric acid, degrades by sulfate attack: the formation of expansive mineral phases, such as ettringite (small needle crystals exerting a huge crystallization pressure inside the concrete pores) and gypsum creates inner tensile forces in the concrete matrix which destroy the hardened cement paste, form cracks and fissures in concrete, and can lead to the ultimate ruin of the structure. Normalized tests for construction aggregate certify such materials as free of pyrite or marcasite.

==Occurrence==
Pyrite is the most common of sulfide minerals and is widespread in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. It is a common accessory mineral in igneous rocks, where it also occasionally occurs as larger masses arising from an immiscible sulfide phase in the original magma. It is found in metamorphic rocks as a product of contact metamorphism. It also forms as a high-temperature hydrothermal mineral, though it occasionally forms at lower temperatures.
Pyrite occurs both as a primary mineral, present in the original sediments, and as a secondary mineral, deposited during diagenesis. Pyrite and marcasite commonly occur as replacement pseudomorphs after fossils in black shale and other sedimentary rocks formed under reducing environmental conditions. Pyrite is common as an accessory mineral in shale, where it is formed by precipitation from anoxic seawater, and coal beds often contain significant pyrite.

Notable deposits are found as lenticular masses in Virginia, U.S., and in smaller quantities in many other locations. Large deposits are mined at Rio Tinto in Spain and elsewhere in the Iberian Peninsula.

==Cultural beliefs==
In the beliefs of the Thai people (especially those in the south), pyrite is known as &quot;Khao tok Phra Ruang&quot;, &quot;Khao khon bat Phra Ruang&quot; (ข้าวตอกพระร่วง, ข้าวก้นบาตรพระร่วง) or &quot;Phet na tang&quot;, &quot;Hin na tang&quot; (เพชรหน้าทั่ง, หินหน้าทั่ง). It is believed to be a sacred item that has the power to prevent evil, black magic or demons.

==Events of Go-Fushimi&#x27;s life==
Tanehito-shinnō was named Crown Prince or heir in 1289.

* 30 August 1298 (&quot;Einin 6, 22nd day of the 7th month&quot;): In the 11th year of Fushimi&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his son.
* 17 November 1298 (&quot;Einin 6, 13th day of the 10th month&quot;): Emperor Go-Fushimi acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;) and the &quot;nengō&quot; was changed to &quot;Shōan&quot; to mark the beginning of a new emperor&#x27;s reign.
* 1 November 1299 (&quot;Shōan 1, 8th day of the 10th month&quot;): Chinese Chan master Yishan Yining arrived in Kamakura as a last Mongol envoy. 
* 2 March 1301 (&quot;Shōan 3, 21st day of the 1st month&quot;): Abdicates due to rally of the Daikakuji Line
* 11 September 1308 (&quot;Tokuji 3, 26th day of the 8th month&quot;): Younger brother becomes Emperor Hanazono, retired emperor
* 17 May 1336 (&quot;Engen 1, 6th day of the 4th month&quot;): Died
Fushimi acted as cloistered emperor for a period, but after a while, from 1313 to 1318, Go-Fushimi acted in that function.

During Hanazono&#x27;s reign, negotiations between the Kamakura shogunate and the two lines resulted in an agreement to alternate the throne between the two lines every 10 years (the Bumpō Agreement). This agreement did not last long, as it was broken by Emperor Go-Daigo.

Go-Fushimi was the author of a famous plea to the god of the Kamo Shrine for help in gaining the throne for his son. This plea was ultimately successful, but it was not until thirty-three years after his abdication that Go-Fushimi&#x27;s son, Emperor Kōgon became emperor. Kōgon was the first of the northern court emperors backed by the Ashikaga shogunate.

Emperor Go-Fushimi is enshrined with other emperors at the imperial tomb called &quot;Fukakusa no kita no misasagi&quot; () in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto.

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Fo-Fushimi&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Takatsukasa Kanetada, 1298
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Nijō Kanemoto, 1298–1300
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Nijō Kanemoto, 1300–1305
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Nadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Go-Fushimi&#x27;s reign==
The years of Go-Fushimi&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Einin&quot; (1293–1299)
* &quot;Shōan&quot; (1299–1302)

Shortly thereafter, Emperor Go-Nijō is said to have acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’).

Go-Nijō&#x27;s father, the Emperor Go-Uda reigned as cloistered emperor during his reign.

The succession dispute between the Daikakuji and Jimyōin branches of the Imperial Family continued during his reign. His grandfather, the retired Emperor Emperor Kameyama was said to have acted through the Bakufu to ensure Go-Nijō&#x27;s enthronement.
On 10 September 1308, Go-Nijō died of illness.

Go-Nijō is buried at &quot;Kitashirakawa no misasagi&quot; (北白河陵) in Sakyō-ku, Kyoto.

<text>Emperor Go-Daigo (後醍醐天皇 &quot;Go-Daigo-tennō&quot;) (26 November 1288 – 19 September 1339) was the 96th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. He successfully overthrew the Kamakura shogunate in 1333 and established the short-lived Kenmu Restoration to bring the Imperial House back into power. This was to be the last time the emperor had real power until the Meiji Restoration in 1868. The Kenmu restoration was in turn overthrown by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, ushering in the Ashikaga shogunate. The overthrow split the imperial family into two opposing factions between the Ashikaga backed Northern Court situated in Kyoto and the Southern Court based in Yoshino. The Southern Court was led by Go-Daigo and his later successors.

This 14th-century sovereign personally chose his posthumous name after the 9th-century Emperor Daigo and &quot;go-&quot; (後), translates as &quot;later&quot;, and he is thus sometimes called the &quot;Later Emperor Daigo&quot;, or, in some older sources, &quot;Daigo, the second&quot; or as &quot;Daigo II&quot;.

==Biography==
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was Takaharu&quot;-shinnō&quot; (尊治親王).

He was the second son of the Daikakuji-tō emperor, Emperor Go-Uda. His mother was Fujiwara no &quot;Chūshi&quot;/Tadako (&quot;藤原忠子&quot;), daughter of Fujiwara no Tadatsugu (Itsutsuji Tadatsugu) (&quot;藤原忠継/五辻忠継&quot;). She became Nyoin called Dantenmon-in (談天門院). His older brother was Emperor Go-Nijō.

Emperor Go-Daigo&#x27;s ideal was the Engi era (901–923) during the reign of Emperor Daigo, a period of direct imperial rule. An emperor&#x27;s posthumous name was normally chosen after his death, but Emperor Go-Daigo chose his personally during his lifetime, to share it with Emperor Daigo.

===Events of Go-Daigo&#x27;s life===

* 1308 (&quot;Enkyō 1&quot;): At the death of Emperor Go-Nijō, Hanazono accedes to the Chrysanthemum Throne at age 12 years; and Takaharu&quot;-shinnō&quot;, the second son of former-Emperor Go-Uda is elevated as Crown Prince and heir apparent under the direction of the Kamakura shogunate.
* 29 March 1318 (&quot;Bunpō 2, 26th day of 2nd month&quot;): In the 11th year of Hanazono&#x27;s reign (花園天皇十一年), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his cousin, the second son of former-Emperor Go-Uda. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Go-Daigo is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).
* 1319 (&quot;Bunpō 3, 4th month&quot;): Emperor Go-Daigo caused the &quot;nengō&quot; to be changed to &quot;Gen&#x27;ō&quot; to mark the beginning of his reign.
In 1324, with the discovery of Emperor Go-Daigo&#x27;s plans to overthrow the Kamakura shogunate, the Rokuhara Tandai disposed of his close associate Hino Suketomo in the .
In the Genkō Incident of 1331, Emperor Go-Daigo&#x27;s plans were again discovered, this time by a betrayal by his close associate Yoshida Sadafusa. He quickly hid the Sacred Treasures in a secluded castle in Kasagiyama (the modern town of Kasagi, Sōraku District, Kyōto Prefecture) and raised an army, but the castle fell to the shogunate&#x27;s army the following year, and they enthroned Emperor Kōgon, exiling Daigo to Oki Province (the Oki Islands in modern-day Shimane Prefecture), the same place to which Emperor Go-Toba had been exiled after the Jōkyū War of 1221.

In 1333, Emperor Go-Daigo escaped from Oki with the help of Nawa Nagatoshi and his family, raising an army at Senjo Mountain in Hōki Province (the modern town of Kotoura in Tōhaku District, Tottori Prefecture). Ashikaga Takauji, who had been sent by the shogunate to find and destroy this army, sided with the emperor and captured the Rokuhara Tandai. Immediately following this, Nitta Yoshisada, who had raised an army in the east, laid siege to Kamakura. When the city finally fell to Nitta, Hōjō Takatoki, the shogunal regent, fled to Tōshō temple, where he and his entire family committed suicide. This ended Hōjō power and paved the way for a new military regime.

Upon his triumphal return to Kyoto, Daigo took the throne from Emperor Kōgon and began the Kenmu Restoration. The Restoration was ostensibly a revival of the older ways, but, in fact, the emperor had his eye set on an imperial dictatorship like that of the emperor of China. He wanted to imitate the Chinese in all their ways and become the most powerful ruler in the East. Impatient reforms, litigation over land rights, rewards, and the exclusion of the samurai from the political order caused much complaining, and his political order began to fall apart. In 1335, Ashikaga Takauji, who had travelled to eastern Japan without obtaining an imperial edict in order to suppress the Nakasendai Rebellion, became disaffected. Daigo ordered Nitta Yoshisada to track down and destroy Ashikaga. Ashikaga defeated Nitta Yoshisada at the Battle of Takenoshita, Hakone. Kusunoki Masashige and Kitabatake Akiie, in communication with Kyoto, smashed the Ashikaga army. Takauji fled to Kyūshū, but the following year, after reassembling his army, he again approached Kyōto. Kusunoki Masashige proposed a reconciliation with Takauji to the emperor, but Go-Daigo rejected this. He ordered Masashige and Yoshisada to destroy Takauji. Kusunoki&#x27;s army was defeated at the Battle of Minatogawa.

When Ashikaga&#x27;s army entered Kyōto, Emperor Go-Daigo resisted, fleeing to Mount Hiei, but seeking reconciliation, he sent the imperial regalia to the Ashikaga side. Takauji enthroned the Jimyōin-tō emperor, Kōmyō, and officially began his shogunate with the enactment of the Kenmu Law Code.

Go-Daigo escaped from the capital in January 1337, the regalia that he had handed over to the Ashikaga being counterfeit, and set up the Southern Court among the mountains of Yoshino, beginning the Period of Northern and Southern Courts in which the Northern Dynasty in Kyoto and the Southern Dynasty in Yoshino faced off against each other.

Emperor Go-Daigo ordered Imperial Prince Kaneyoshi to Kyūshū and Nitta Yoshisada and Imperial Prince Tsuneyoshi to Hokuriku, and so forth, dispatching his sons all over, so that they could oppose the Northern Court.

* 18 September 1339 (&quot;Ryakuō 2, 15th day of the 8th month&quot;): In the 21st year of Go-Daigo&#x27;s reign, the emperor abdicated at Yoshino in favor of his son, Noriyoshi&quot;-shinnō,&quot; who would become Emperor Go-Murakami.
* 19 September 1339 (&quot;Ryakuō 2, 16th day of the 8th month&quot;): Go-Daigo died;

The actual site of Go-Daigo&#x27;s grave is settled. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Nara.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Go-Daigo&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Tō-no-o no misasagi&quot;.

==Kugyō==
&quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Go-Daigo&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Nijō Michihira, 1316–1318
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Ichijō Uchitsune, 1318–1323
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Kujō Fusazane, 1323–1324
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Takatsukasa Fuyuhira, 1324–1327
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Nijō Michihira, 1327–1330
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Konoe Tsunetada, 1330
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Takatsukasa Fuyunori, 1330–1333
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Go-Daigo&#x27;s reign==
The years of Go-Daigo&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;. Emperor Go-Daigo&#x27;s eight era name changes are mirrored in number only in the reign of Emperor Go-Hanazono, who also reigned through eight era name changes.

<text>was the 98th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. He reigned from 1368 through 1383. His personal name was Yutanari (寛成) and his regal name roughly translates to &quot;Long Celebration&quot;.

==Genealogy==
His father was Emperor Go-Murakami and his mother may have been Kaki Mon&#x27;in.

*Empress (chūgū): Saionji Kinshige&#x27;s daughter
** Gyōgo (行悟; 1377–1406)
*Nyōgo: Noriko (father and family unknown)
** First son: Imperial Prince Tokiyasu (世泰親王)
*Unknown
** Kaimonji Kosho (海門承朝; 1374–1443)
** Sonsei (尊聖; 1376–1432), 
** son: founder of Tamagawa family (玉川宮)

==Biography==
On March 29, 1368 (&quot;Shōhei 23, 11th day of the 3rd month&quot;), following the death of Emperor Murakami II, he was enthroned in the house of the Chief Priest at the Sumiyoshi Grand Shrine in Sumiyoshi, Osaka, where the Southern Court had made its capital. However, because the Southern Court&#x27;s influence was declining, the enthronement remained in some doubt until the Taishō period. In 1926, the enthronement was officially recognized and inserted into the Imperial Line.

Emperor Chōkei insisted throughout his reign on fighting the Northern Dynasty, but it was already too late. In 1383 or 1384, he abdicated to Emperor Go-Kameyama, who supported the peace faction.

After the reunification of the rival courts, he went into retirement and eventually returned to Yoshino where he died on August 27, 1394. The &quot;kami&quot; of Emperor Chōkei is venerated at Shishō jinja in Totsugawa, Yamato province.

===Kugyō===
&quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Chōkei&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Nadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Chōkei&#x27;s reign==
The years of Chōkei&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.

:&quot;Nanboku-chō&quot; southern court
*Eras as reckoned by legitimate Court (as determined by Meiji rescript)
* &quot;Shōhei&quot; (1346–1370)
* &quot;Kentoku&quot; (1370–1372)
* &quot;Bunchū&quot; (1372–1375)
* &quot;Tenju&quot; (1375–1381)
* &quot;Kōwa&quot; (1381–1384)

:&quot;Nanboku-chō&quot; northern court
*Eras as reckoned by pretender Court (as determined by Meiji rescript)
* &quot;Ōan&quot; (1368–1375)
* &quot;Eiwa&quot; (1375–1379)
* &quot;Kōryaku&quot; (1379–1381)
* &quot;Eitoku&quot; (1381–1384)

<text>(c. 1347 – May 10, 1424) was the 99th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. He ruled from 1383 to October 21, 1392, becoming the last Emperor of the Southern Court. His personal name was .

This 14th century sovereign was named after the 13th century Emperor Kameyama and &quot;go-&quot; (後), translates literally as &quot;later&quot;; and thus, he could be called the &quot;Later Emperor Kameyama&quot;. The Japanese word &quot;go&quot; has also been translated to mean the &quot;second one&quot;; and in some older sources, this emperor may be identified as &quot;Kameyama, the second&quot; or as &quot;Kameyama II&quot;.

==Genealogy==
He was the second son of Emperor Go-Murakami. His mother was Fujiwara Katsuko (藤原勝子), better known as Kaki Mon&#x27;in.

Little is known of his empress or other consorts. Imperial Prince Tsuneatsu (恒敦) is believed to be his son.
*Empress: Minamoto (Kitabatake) Nobuko, Kitabatake Akinobu&#x27;s daughter
**Third Son: Imperial Prince Yoshiyasu (良泰親王; 1370–1443)
** Imperial Prince Priest Gyōgo (行悟法親王; 1377–1406)
** First Daughter: Imperial Princess Yasuko (泰子内親王) married Nijō Fuyuzane

*Consort: Fujiwara (Nijo) Noriko, Nijo Norimoto&#x27;s daughter
** First Son: Imperial Prince Tokiyasu (世泰親王, 1360–1377)
*Lady-in-waiting: Fujiwara (Hino) Kuniko, Hino Kunimitsu&#x27;s daughter
** Second Son: Imperial Prince Moroyasu (師泰親王; 1362–1423)
** Shino (真阿, 1374–1440)

*Mother unknown
** Imperial Prince Tsuneatsu (恒敦, d.1422), First Head of Ogawa clan.
** Sonkoku (琮頊, d.1448)

==Life==
Go-Kameyama acceded to the throne during the turbulent &quot;Nanboku-chō&quot; period during which rival claimants to the Chrysanthemum Throne gathered supporters around them in what were known as the Northern court and the Southern Court. Go-Kameyama became Emperor in what was called the Southern court when Emperor Chōkei abdicated in 1383. On October 15, 1392, at the insistence of the peace faction amongst his own courtiers, he applied to Ashikaga Yoshimitsu for peace; and he subsequently returned to the capital where he did hand over the Sacred Treasures to his Northern Court rival. In doing so, Go-Kameyama was understood to have abdicated.

By the conditions of the peace treaty, the Northern Court and the Southern Court were supposed to alternate control of the throne. However, this was thrown out in 1412 as Emperor Go-Komatsu reneged on the treaty by abdicating in favour of his own son. Henceforth, no Southern Court claimant ever sat on the Chrysthansemum Throne again. Still, since 1911, the Japanese government has declared the southern claimants were actually the rightful emperors despite the fact that all subsequent emperors including the then-Emperor Meiji were descended from the Northern Court, reasoning the Southern Court retained possession of the three sacred treasures, thus converting the emperors of the former Northern court into mere pretenders.

Following his abdication, he went into seclusion; but, in 1410, he returned to Yoshino.

The Imperial Household Agency recognizes &quot;Saga no ogura no misasagi&quot; (嵯峨小倉陵) in Ukyō-ku, Kyoto as his tomb.

===Kugyō===
&quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Go-Kameyama&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Nadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Go-Kameyama&#x27;s reign==
The years of Go-Kameyama&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.

:&quot;Nanboku-chō&quot; southern court
*Eras as reckoned by legitimate Court (as determined by Meiji rescript)
** &quot;Kōwa&quot; (1381–1384)
** &quot;Genchū&quot; (1384–1393)

:&quot;Nanboku-chō&quot; northern court
*Eras as reckoned by pretender Court (as determined by Meiji rescript)
** &quot;Eitoku&quot; (1381–1384)
** &quot;Shitoku&quot; (1384–1387)
** &quot;Kakei&quot; (1387–1389)
** &quot;Kōō&quot; (1389–1390)
** &quot;Meitoku&quot; (1390–1393)‡

:Post&quot;-Nanboku-chō&quot; reunified court
*Eras merged as &quot;Meitoku&quot; 3 replaced &quot;Genchū&quot; 9 as Go-Kameyama abdicated.

<text>Pylos (, ; ), historically also known as Navarino, is a town and a former municipality in Messenia, Peloponnese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform, it has been part of the municipality Pylos-Nestoras, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit. It was the capital of the former Pylia Province. It is the main harbour on the Bay of Navarino. Nearby villages include Gialova, Pyla, Elaiofyto, Schinolakka, and Palaionero. The town of Pylos has 2,568 inhabitants, the municipal unit of Pylos 4,559 (2021). The municipal unit has an area of 143.911 km2.

Pylos has been inhabited since Neolithic times. It was a significant kingdom in Mycenaean Greece, with the remains of the so-called &quot;Palace of Nestor&quot; excavated nearby, named after Nestor, the king of Pylos in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;. In Classical times, the site was uninhabited, but became the site of the Battle of Pylos in 425 BC, during the Peloponnesian War. After that, Pylos is scarcely mentioned until the 13th century, when it became part of the Frankish Principality of Achaea. Increasingly known by its French name of &quot;Port-de-Jonc&quot; or its Italian name &quot;Navarino&quot;, in the 1280s the Franks built the Old Navarino castle on the site. Pylos came under the control of the Republic of Venice from 1417 until 1500, when it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans used Pylos and its bay as a naval base, and built the New Navarino fortress there. The area remained under Ottoman control, with the exception of a brief period of renewed Venetian rule from 1685–1715 and a Russian occupation from 1770–71, until the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence in 1821. Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt recovered it for the Ottomans in 1825, but the defeat of the Turco-Egyptian fleet in the 1827 Battle of Navarino and the French military intervention of the 1828 Morea expedition forced Ibrahim to withdraw from the Peloponnese and confirmed Greek independence. The current city was built outside the fortress walls by the military engineers of the Morea expedition from 1829 and the name &quot;Pylos&quot; was revived by royal decree in 1833.

==Name==

Pylos retained its ancient name into Byzantine times, but after the Frankish conquest in the early 13th century, two new names appear:
* a French one, (&quot;Rush Harbour&quot;) or , with some variants and derivatives: in Italian , or , in medieval Catalan , in Latin , ( or ) in Greek, etc. It takes that name from the marshes surrounding the place.
* a Greek one, (), later shortened to () or lengthened to () by epenthesis, which became in Italian (probably by rebracketing) and in French. Its etymology is not certain. A traditional etymology, proposed by the early 15th-century traveller Nompar de Caumont and repeated as late as the works of Karl Hopf in the 19th century, ascribed the name to the Navarrese Company, but that is clearly an error since the name was in use long before the Navarrese presence in Greece. In 1830, Fallmereyer proposed that it could originate from a body of Avars who settled there, a view adopted by a few later scholars like William Miller. Modern scholarship, on the other hand, considers it more likely that it originates from a Slavic name meaning &quot;place of maples&quot;. The name of /, although in use before the Frankish period, came into widespread use and eclipsed the French name of and its derivations only in the 15th century, after the collapse of the Frankish Principality of Achaea.

In the late 14th or early 15th century, when it was held by the Navarrese Company, it was also known as , and called (, &quot;village of the Spaniards&quot;) by the local Greeks.

Under Ottoman rule (1498–1685, 1715–1821), the Turkish name was (). After the construction of the new Ottoman fortress () in 1571/2, it became known as ( or , &quot;new castle&quot;) among the local Greeks, while the old Frankish castle became known as ( or , &quot;old castle&quot;).

==History==
===Neolithic Pylos===
The region of Pylos has a long history, which goes hand in hand with that of Peloponnese. It starts in the depths of prehistory, as the region has been inhabited since the Neolithic, when populations from Anatolia began to spread in the Balkans and Greece around 6500 BC, bringing with them the practice of agriculture and farming. Excavations have demonstrated a continuous human presence from the Late Neolithic period (5300 BC) on several sites of Pylia, in particular in those of &quot;Voidokilia&quot; and of &quot;Nestor&#x27;s&quot; &quot;cave&quot;, where numerous ostraca or fragments of painted, black and polished ceramics have been found, as well as later engraved and written pottery. The Neolithic period ended with the appearance of bronze metallurgy around 3000 BC.

=== Mycenaean Pylos ===

During the Bronze Age (3000–1000 BC), the Mycenaean civilization developed, particularly in Peloponnese. Pylos then became the capital of one of the most important human centers of this civilization and of a powerful kingdom, often referred to as Nestor&#x27;s kingdom of &quot;sandy Pylos&quot; (&quot;ἠμαθόεις&quot;) and described later by Homer in both his &quot;Iliad&quot; and his &quot;Odyssey&quot; (Book 17) when Telemachus says:

The Mycenaean state of Pylos (1600–1200 BC) covered an area of and had a minimum population of 50,000 according to the Linear B tablets discovered there, or even perhaps as large as 80,000–120,000. It should not however be confused with the current city of Pylos. The urban center of ancient Pylos indeed remains only partially identified to date. The various archaeological remains of palaces and administrative or residential infrastructures that have been found in the region so far suggest to modern scholars that the ancient city would have developed over a much larger area, that of the Pylia Province. The typical point of reference for the Mycenaean city remains the Palace of Nestor, but many other palaces (such as those of Nichoria and Iklaina) or villages (such as Malthi) of the Mycenaean era have been recently discovered, which were quickly subordinated to Pylos. Its port and its acropolis were probably established on the &quot;Koryphasion&quot; promontory (or &quot;Cape Coryphasium&quot;) commanding the northern entrance to the bay, 4 km north of the modern city and south of Nestor&#x27;s palace, but no remains were found.The Pylos site is located on the hill of Ano Englianos, about 9 km northeast of the bay , near the village of Chora and about 17 kilometres from the modern city of Pylos. It hosts one of the most important Mycenaean palaces in Greece, known as the great &quot;Palace of Nestor&quot; described in the Homeric poems. This palace remains today the best preserved palace in Greece and one of the most important of all Mycenaean civilization. It was discovered and first excavated in 1939 by American archaeologist Carl Blegen (1887–1971) of the University of Cincinnati and the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, and by Konstantinos Kourouniotis (1872–1945) of the Greek archaeological service. Their excavations were interrupted by the Second World War, and then resumed in 1952 under the direction of Blegen until 1966. He found many architectural elements such as the throne room with its foyer, an anteroom, rooms and passageways all covered with frescoes of Minoan inspiration, and also large warehouses, the external walls of the palace, unique baths, galleries, and 90 meters outside the palace, a beehive &quot;tholos&quot; tomb, perfectly restored in 1957 (&quot;Tholos tomb IV&quot;).

In addition to the archaeological remains of the palace, Blegen also found there thousands of clay tablets with inscriptions written in Linear B, a syllabic script used between 1425 and 1200 BC for writing Mycenaean Greek. Pylos is the largest source in Greece of these tablets with 1,087 fragments found on the site of the Nestor&#x27;s Palace. In 1952, when self-taught linguist Michael Ventris and John Chadwick deciphered the script, Mycenaean Greek turned out to be the earliest attested form of Greek, some elements of which have survived in the language of Homer thanks to a long oral tradition of epic poetry. Thus, these clay tablets, generally used for administrative purposes or for recording economic transactions, clearly demonstrate that the site itself was already called &quot;Pylos&quot; by its Mycenaean inhabitants (&quot;Pulos&quot; in Mycenaean Greek; attested in Linear B as &quot;pu-ro,&quot; ).

In 2015, the team of American archaeologists Sharon Stocker and Jack L. Davis of the University of Cincinnati and under the aegis of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, discovered near the &quot;Tholos tomb IV&quot;, a shaft tomb (non-tholos) dated to the Late Helladic IIA (LHIIA, 1600–1470 BC), of an individual of 30–35 years old and 1.70 m tall, the &quot;Griffin warrior&quot;, named for the mythological creature, part eagle, part lion, engraved on an ivory plaque in his tomb. The tomb also contained armor, weapons, mirror and many pearl and gold jewels, including several gold signet rings of exceptional craftsmanship and thoroughness. Researchers believe it could be the grave of a Wanax, a tribal king, lord or military leader during the Mycenaean era. It was also in this tomb that was found the Pylos Combat Agate, a seal made of agate dated from around 1450 BCE, which represents a warrior engaged in a hand-to-hand combat. In 2017, the same team discovered two other exceptional tholos tombs, &quot;Tholos tombs VI and VII&quot;. Although their domes had collapsed, they discovered that they were littered with flakes of gold leaf that once papered the walls and found a multitude of cultural artifacts and delicate jewelry, including a gold pendant representing the head of the Egyptian goddess Hathor, which showed for the first time that Pylos clearly had trade relations with Egypt and the Middle East around 1500 BCE.

Pylos was the only palace of that time to have no walls or fortifications. It was destroyed by fire around 1180 BC and many clay tablets in linear B clearly bear the stigmata of the fire. The Linear B archives found there, preserved by the heat of the fire that destroyed the palace, mention hasty defence preparations due to an imminent attack without giving any detail about the attacking force. The site of the Mycenaean Pylos then seems to have been abandoned during the Dark Ages (1100–800 BC). The region of Pylos, together with that of the ancient Messene, was later enslaved by Sparta.

The ruins of a crude stone fortress on nearby Sphacteria, apparently of Mycenaean origin, were used by the Spartans during the Peloponnesian War. (Thucydides iv. 31)

===Classical Pylos===

It was one of the last places which held out against the Spartans in the Second Messenian War, after which the inhabitants emigrated to Cyllene, and from there, with the other Messenians, to Sicily. Its name is mentioned again in the seventh year of the Peloponnesian War. According to the Greek historian Thucydides in his &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot;, the area was &quot;together with most of the country round, unpopulated&quot;. The ancient city was not located at the modern Pylos, but north of the isle of Sphacteria. In 425 BC the Athenian politician Cleon sent an expedition to Pylos where the Athenians fortified the rocky promontory now known as Koryphasion (Κορυφάσιον) or Old Pylos at the northern edge of the bay, near the Gialova Lagoon, and after a conflict with Spartan ships in the Battle of Pylos, seized and occupied the bay. Demosthenes, the Athenian commander, completed the fort in 424 BC.

The erection of this fort led to one of the most memorable events in the Peloponnesian War. Thucydides has given a minute account of the topography of the district, which, though clear and consistent with itself, does not coincide, in all points, with the existing locality, Thucydides describes the harbour, of which the promontory Coryphasium (&quot;Koryphasion&quot;) formed the northern termination, as fronted and protected by the island Sphacteria, which stretched along the coast, leaving only two narrow entrances to the harbour,--the one at the northern end, opposite to Coryphasium, being only wide enough to admit two triremes abreast, and the other at the southern end wide enough for eight or nine triremes. The island was about 15 stadia in width, covered with wood, uninhabited and untrodden. Pausanias also says that the island Sphacteria lies before the harbour of Pylos like Rheneia before the anchorage of Delos. A little later the Athenians captured a number of Spartan troops besieged on the adjacent island of Sphacteria (see Battle of Sphacteria). Spartan anxiety over the return of the prisoners, who were taken to Athens as hostages, contributed to their acceptance of the Peace of Nicias in 421 BC.

Little is known of Pylos under Byzantine rule, except for a mention of raids by Cretan Saracens in the area c. 872/3. In the 12th century, the Muslim geographer al-Idrisi mentioned it as the &quot;commodious port&quot; of &quot;Irūda&quot; in his &quot;Nuzhat al-Mushtaq&quot;.

In 1204, following the Fourth Crusade, the Peloponnese became the Principality of Achaea, a Crusader state. Pylos fell quickly to the Crusaders according to a brief reference in the &quot;Chronicle of the Morea&quot;, but it is not until the 1280s that it is mentioned again. According to the French and Greek versions of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, Nicholas II of Saint Omer, the lord of Thebes, who in c. 1281 received extensive lands in Messenia in exchange for his wife&#x27;s possessions of Kalamata and Chlemoutsi, erected a castle at Navarino. According to the Greek version, he intended this as a future fief for his nephew, Nicholas III, although the Aragonese version attributes the construction to Nicholas III himself, a few years later. According to A. Bon, a construction under Nicholas II in the 1280s is more likely, possibly in the period 1287–89 when he served as the viceroy () of Achaea. Despite Nicholas II&#x27;s intentions, however, it is unclear whether his nephew did indeed inherit Navarino. If he did, it remained his until his death in 1317, when it and all the Messenian lands of the family reverted to the princely domain, as Nicholas III had no children.

The fortress remained relatively unimportant thereafter, except for the naval battle in 1354 between Venice and Genoa, and an episode in 1364, during the conflict between Mary of Bourbon and the Prince Philip of Taranto, due to Mary&#x27;s attempt to claim the Principality following the death of her husband, Robert of Taranto. Mary had been given possession of Navarino (along with Kalamata and Mani) by Robert in 1358, and the local castellan, loyal to Mary, briefly imprisoned the new Prince&#x27;s , Simon del Poggio. Mary retained control of Navarino until her death in 1377. At about this time, Albanians settled in the area, while in 1381/2, Navarrese, Gascon and Italian mercenaries were active there. From the early years of the 15th century, Venice set its eyes on the fortress of Navarino, fearing lest its rivals the Genoese seize it and use it as a base for attacks against the Venetian outposts of Modon and Coron. In the event, the Venetians seized the fortress themselves in 1417 and, after prolonged diplomatic manoeuvring, succeeded in legitimizing their new possession in 1423.

===First Venetian and first Ottoman periods ===

In 1423, Navarino, like the rest of the Peloponnese, suffered its first Ottoman raid, led by Turakhan Bey, which was repeated in 1452. It was also at Navarino that Emperor John VIII Palaiologos embarked in 1437, heading for the Council of Ferrara, and where the last Despot of the Morea, Thomas Palaiologos, embarked with his family in 1460, following the Ottoman conquest of the Despotate of the Morea. After 1460, the fortress, along with the other Venetian outposts and Monemvasia and the Mani Peninsula, were the only Christian-held areas in the peninsula. Venetian control over Navarino survived the First Ottoman–Venetian War (1463–79), but not the Second (1499–1503): following the Venetian defeat in the Battle of Modon in August 1500, the 3,000-strong garrison surrendered, although it was well provisioned for a siege. The Venetians recaptured it shortly after, on 3/4 December, but on 20 May 1501, a joint Ottoman land and sea attack under Kemal Reis and Hadım Ali Pasha retook it.
The Ottomans used Navarino (which they called or ) as a naval base, either for piratical raids or for major fleet operations in the Ionian and Adriatic seas. In 1572/3, the Ottoman chief admiral (Kapudan Pasha) Uluç Ali Reis built a new fortress at Navarino (, &quot;New Navarino&quot;, or , in Greek), to replace the outdated Frankish castle.

The Venetians briefly captured Navarino in the 1650s during the Cretan War.

In 1668, Evliya Çelebi described the city in his &quot;Seyahatname&quot;:

Anavarin-i Atik is an unequalled castle... the harbor is a safe anchorage...&lt;br&gt;in most streets of Anavarin-i Cedid there are many fountains of running water... The city is embellished with trees and vines so that the sun does not beat into the fine marketplace at all, and
all the city notables sit here, playing backgammon, chess, various kinds of draughts, and other board games...
===Second Venetian period and Ottoman reconquest===
In 1685, during the early stages of the Morean War, the Venetians under Francesco Morosini and Otto Wilhelm Königsmarck invaded the Peloponnese and captured most of it, successfully storming the two fortresses of Navarino in the process. With the peninsula safely in Venetian hands, Navarino became an administrative centre in the new &quot;Kingdom of the Morea&quot;, as the Venetian province was called, until 1715, when the Ottomans recovered the Peloponnese. The Venetian census of 1689 gave the population as 1,413, while twenty years later it had risen to 1,797 inhabitants.

After the Ottoman reconquest, Navarino became the centre of a &quot;kaza&quot; in the Sanjak of the Morea. On 10 April 1770, after a six-day siege, the fortress of New Navarino surrendered to the Russians during the Orlov Revolt. The Ottoman garrison was allowed to depart for Crete, while the Russians repaired the fortress to make it their base. On 1 June, however, the Russians left, and the Ottomans re-entered the fort and burned and partially demolished it. Meanwhile, the population gathered there had escaped to nearby Sphacteria, where Albanian mercenaries of the Ottomans slaughtered most of them.

=== The Greek War of Independence of 1821 ===

After the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman occupation in mid-March 1821, the Greeks quickly won many victories and proclaimed their independence on 1 January 1822. Navarino was besieged by the local Greeks on 29 March. The garrison, augmented by the local Muslim population of Kyparissia, held out until the first week of August, when they were forced to capitulate. Despite their promise for safe conduct, the Greeks massacred them all.

The Greek victories was short lived. The Sultan called for aid from his Egyptian vassal Muhammad Ali, who dispatched his son Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt to Greece with a fleet and 8,000 men, and later added 25,000 troops. Ibrahim&#x27;s intervention proved decisive: the region of Pylos fell on 18 May 1825 after the battles of Sphacteria (8 May) and Neokastro (11 May), much of the Peloponnese was reconquered in 1825; the gateway town of Messolonghi fell in 1826; and Athens was taken in 1827. The only territory still held by Greek nationalists was in Nafplion, Mani, Hydra, Spetses and Aegina.

=== The Naval Battle of Navarino (20 October 1827) ===
A strong current of philhellenism had developed in Western Europe, especially after the fall in 1826 of Missolonghi, where the poet Lord Byron had died in 1824. Many artists and intellectuals like Chateaubriand, Victor Hugo, Alexander Pushkin, Gioachino Rossini, Hector Berlioz or Eugène Delacroix (in his paintings &quot;Scenes massacres of Scio&quot; in 1824, and &quot;Greece on the ruins of Missolonghi&quot; in 1826), amplified the current of sympathy for the Greek cause in the public opinion. By the Treaty of London of July 1827, France, Russia and the United Kingdom recognised the autonomy of Greece, which remained a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. The three powers agreed to a limited intervention in order to convince the Porte to accept the terms of the convention. A plan to send a naval expedition as a demonstration of force was proposed and adopted; subsequently a fleet of 27 warships of the allied navies of United Kingdom, France and Russia was sent to exert diplomatic pressure against Constantinople. It included twelve British ships (for 456 guns), seven French ships (352 guns) and eight Russian ships (490 guns), for a total firepower of nearly 1,300 guns. The Battle of Navarino (20 October 1827) resulted in the total destruction of the combined Ottoman–Egyptian fleet (around 60 warships destroyed).

An obelisk-shaped memorial dedicated to the victory of the Allied fleets and their three admirals, the British Edward Codrington, the French Henri de Rigny and the Russian Lodewijk van Heiden was later erected on the central square of Pylos. The monument was the work of the sculptor Thomas Thomopoulos (1873–1937) and its unveiling took place in 1930, although it was completed in 1933.

=== The liberation of Pylos (6 October 1828) and the construction of the modern city ===
On 6 October 1828, Pylos was definitively liberated from the Ottoman–Egyptian troops of Ibrahim Pasha by the French troops of the Morea expedition commanded by Marshal Nicolas-Joseph Maison. The mission of this expeditionary corps of 15,000 men, sent by king Charles X of France to the Peloponnese between 1828 and 1833, was to implement the Treaty London of 1827, an agreement under which the Greeks would have the right to an independent state. The French troops liberated the cities of Navarino (Pylos), Modon (Methoni), Coron (Koroni) and Patras in October 1828.

The current city of Pylos was built starting in the spring of 1829, outside the walls of Neokastro, on the model of the bastides of Southwest France and the cities of the Ionian Islands (which share common features, such as a central geometrical square bordered by covered galleries built with a succession of contiguous arches, each supported by a colonnade, as the arcades of Pylos or Corfu). Pylos&#x27;s urban framework was designed by Joseph-Victor Audoy, lieutenant-colonel of the military engineering of the Morea expedition, who originated from Tarn, a department of Southwest France. This plan was approved by the governor of independent Greece Ioannis Kapodistrias on 15 January 1831, making it the second urban plan (after that of Methoni) in the history of the modern Greek state. The fortifications of &quot;Neokastro&quot; were raised, a barracks was built (the &quot;Maison&#x27;s building&quot; which houses nowadays the Archaeological Museum of Pylos), many improvements were made to the city (installation of school, hospital, church, postal service, shops, bridges, squares, fountains, gardens, etc.), the old Ottoman aqueduct, which had fallen into ruins until 1828, was restored (it then served until 1907), and the road between Navarin and Modon, the first road of independent Greece (which is still used today), was also built by the French engineers.

Part of the Morea expedition were also 19 scientists from the &quot;Morea Scientific Mission&quot;, whose work proved essential to the ongoing development of the new Greek State and, more broadly, marked a major milestone in the modern history of archaeology, cartography and natural sciences, as well as in the study of Greece. According to one of their population censuses in the province of Navarino in 1829, it had a total of 1,596 inhabitants. Some French merchants and officers of the Morea expedition, who remained in the city with their families after the troops returned to France in 1833, settled in a district located in the north of the city, near a Catholic church that has since been demolished. This district is still called today &quot;Francomahalas&quot; (in Greek: Φραγκομαχαλάς, from Arabic: محلة (&quot;mahallah&quot;), district) or &quot;Francoklisa&quot; (in Greek: Φραγκοκλησά, church of the French). The French always had a particular interest in the city, and at that time, the greatest French writers wrote texts specifically dedicated to Pylos, such as François-René de Chateaubriand in 1806, Eugène Sue and Victor Hugo in 1827, Edgar Quinet in 1830 and Alphonse de Lamartine in 1832.

In 1833, after the departure of the French, the name &quot;Pylos&quot; (in reference to the ancient city of King Nestor) was given to the new city of Navarino by royal decree of the newly installed king Otto I of Greece.

=== 20th century ===
The fortress of Pylos was transformed into a place of deportation of political opponents during the totalitarian regime of Metaxas between 1936 and 1941. Administratively, Pylos was the seat of the Municipality of Pylos between 1912 and 1946, then became the seat of the Deme of Pylos between 1946 and 2010. Since the 2011 reform, Pylos has been the seat of the new Municipality of Pylos-Nestor.

== Geography ==

=== Site ===
The city of Pylos is located at the foot of a promontory which extends Mount Aghios Nikolaos (482 m) and carries the fortress. It is located at the south-western end of Peloponnese, on the Ionian coast. It is an important shipping center and, in recent years, it has experienced significant tourist development, exploiting its magnificent coastline. The narrow island of Sphacteria serves as a natural breakwater for Navarino Bay, making the port of Pylos one of the safest anchors of the Ionian coast.

=== Communication ===
Pylos has excellent roads and all the communication amenities of a modern city. Greek National Road 82 departs from the center of Pylos and connects directly to Kalamata in less than an hour, and from there to Athens in two hours. Kalamata International Airport (KLX, Captain Vassilis C. Constantakopoulos Airport), which is expanding rapidly, offers many scheduled flights to the major cities of Greece, and many charter flights during the touristic season from many international destinations.

===Population===
According to the census of 2021, the municipality (deme) of Pylos-Nestor has 17,194 inhabitants. The municipal unit of Pylos has 4,559 inhabitants, while the community of Pylos has 2,568 inhabitants, making it the seventh most populous city in Messenia, after the capital Kalamata (58,816), Messini (5,958), Kyparissia (5,763), Filiatra (4,729), Gargalianoi (4,724) and Chora (2,609).
== Urban landscape ==

=== Navarino castles ===

The city of Pylos has two castles (&quot;Kastra&quot;): the Frankish &quot;Paleokastro&quot; (old castle) and the Ottoman &quot;Neokastro&quot; (new castle). The first is located northwest of Navarino Bay and north of the island of Sphacteria, while the second is southwest of the bay, on the heights of the city of Pylos. The &quot;Paleokastro&quot;, located on the top of the promontory of Coryphasium &quot;(Koryphasion)&quot; (which is in geological continuity with the island of Sphacteria from which it is only separated by the narrow pass of &quot;Sykia&quot;), is built on the site of the ancient acropolis of Pylos. It offers a panoramic view, stretching from the Ionian Sea to the Plain of Pylia. Below is Nestor&#x27;s cave, where, according to mythology, the king of Pylos raised his oxen, and the bay of Voidokilia, whose beach is regularly ranked among the most beautiful in the world. It borders the Gialova lagoon (&quot;Osman-aga lake&quot;), located to the east and Navarino bay to the south. However, access to the &quot;Paleokastro&quot; may present some risks for the safety of visitors, due to its great deterioration. On the other side of the Navarino bay, the &quot;Neokastro&quot;, which is in a better state of conservation, looks out onto the island of Sphacteria, the bay of Navarino, and the city. It is one of the best preserved castles in Greece. It contains within its walls the well-preserved &quot;Church of the Transfiguration of the Savior&quot;, built by the Franks, later transformed into a mosque, then again into a Christian church. In the pine forest of the &quot;Neokastro&quot; is also the old barracks built by the French troops of the Morea expedition, which now houses the new archaeological museum of Pylos.

=== Navarino aqueduct ===

South of the city of Pylos, on the road to Methoni, is the old Navarino aqueduct, built in the 16th century by the Ottomans to meet the water supply needs of the &quot;Neokastro&quot;. Composed by two hydraulic systems, it led the waters from the water intakes of the &quot;plateau of Koumbeh&quot; (located near the town of Chandrinou about 15 kilometers northeast of Pylos on the road to Kalamata) and &quot;Paleo Nero&quot; (located near the village of Palaionero). The two systems combined into a single system that can still be seen today around Pylos in the district of &quot;Kamares&quot;. Then, thanks to an underground conduit of the aqueduct, the water penetrated inside the fortress to feed there the fountains of the &quot;Neokastro&quot;.&quot;&quot; Fallen into ruins until 1828, it was restored in 1832 by the French engineers of the Morea expedition, and was used to supply Pylos with water until 1907.

=== Pylos city center ===

Leaning against two hills, one of which is overlooked by the fortress of the &quot;Neokastro,&quot; the town of Pylos faces the bay of Navarino. Pylos preserves many houses from the 19th century. These are built of stone, with typical Messenian architecture and surrounded by spacious courtyards and gardens. They are built mainly between narrow streets, generally symmetrical, and according to the original urban plan established by French military engineers of the Morea expedition at the beginning of the 19th century. Many of the streets have retained their original stone paving, and several of those which climb the hills, are pedestrianized and have steps.

Near the seafront is the central city square, the Square of the Three Admirals, surrounded by buildings whose ground floor houses, most often under arcade galleries, markets, bakeries, shops and traditional cafes. The seaside, to the north-west of the city, follows a recently pedestrianized street which leads from the central square to the modern port, passing through the &quot;Francomahalas&quot; district. In this street, aligned along the old port, are several traditional fish taverns. The port is dominated by the City Hall of Pylos. Next to it is recently renovated two-story house of the Olympic champion Kostis Tsiklitiras, in which a museum has been installed, which exposes a collection of paintings, engravings and ancient documents collected by the French philhellene, historian and writer René Puaux (1878–1936). A little further, still following the seaside, is the historic building of the College of Pylos which was founded in September 1921 by royal decree and built in 1924. After the cessation of its activities in 1987, the building housed until very recently the Institute of Physical Astrophysics &quot;Nestor&quot; of the National Observatory of Greece. The institute is in charge of the international research project NESTOR and its underwater neutrino detector, which is installed more than 4,000 meters deep, in the deepest marine trench of the Mediterranean Sea, 31 km off Pylos. In September 1992, the historic building of the College of Pylos was classified by the Ministry of Culture as a &quot;Preserved Historic Monument&quot; and will house soon in the near future the public library and gallery of the municipality of Pylos.

The city also has bank branches, a post office, various clinics, a health center, a fire station, a sailing school, nurseries, primary schools, a college, a high school and a music conservatory recognized by the State. The city is also home to several cultural and development associations.

=== The central square of the Three Admirals ===
Also built by French troops of the Morea expedition in 1829, the central square of Pylos is characterized by its triangular geometric pattern, one of the sides of which opens onto the sea and the port of Pylos, and whose two other sides are bordered by covered galleries with arcades, built with a succession of contiguous arches, each supported by a colonnade, recalling the architecture of the central squares of the bastides of Southwest France and those of the cities of the Ionian Islands (such as Corfu). These galleries are home to many small markets and businesses, as well as traditional and more modern cafes and restaurants. Most of their terraces extend over the square itself, which is shaded by several hundred-year-old plane trees. In the center, surrounded by two majestic phoenix, is a monument commemorating the battle of Navarino, an obelisk dedicated to the victory of the Allied fleets and their three admirals, the British Edward Codrington, the French Henri de Rigny and the Russian Lodewijk van Heiden.

=== Churches ===
On the eastern slope of Pylos hill is the Church of the Dormition of the Virgin Mary (&quot;Ieros Naos tis Kimiseos tis Theotokou&quot;), while to the west, inside the &quot;Neokastro&quot;, is the former Church of the Transfiguration of the Savior (&quot;Ieros Naos tis Metamorphosis tou Sotiros&quot;), both of which belong to the Metropolis of Messenia. The Church of the Transfiguration occasionally organizes religious activities (it has been converted into a museum and exhibition center), while that of the Dormition of the Virgin Mary still gathers many faithful during its regular services, and particularly during the celebration of Easter and the Myrtidiotissa Virgin (the Virgin with myrtles, to whom the church is dedicated) which attract many pilgrims from Athens and abroad who come to take part in processions that take place in the center of the city.

=== The port and the marina ===

The port of Pylos is one of the safest boarding destinations for ships traveling in the Mediterranean Sea. Navarino Bay continues to regularly serve as a shelter for ships during storms in the Mediterranean Sea. In addition, its strategic location between the Ionian Sea and the Aegean Sea makes it an ideal destination for an intermediate station on the route to the Cyclades, the Dodecanese Islands or to Crete. With its modern pier, it frequently welcomes many cruise ships during the summer season. To the east of the port, there is also the marina of Pylos, for which a project of modernization is currently running to meet the requirements for the rapid tourism development of the region.

== Around Pylos ==

=== The Palace of Nestor ===

North of Pylos () and south of the town of Chora (4 kilometres), is the hill of &quot;Ano Englianos&quot; which houses the Mycenaean Bronze Age palace known as the &quot;Palace of Nestor&quot; (1600–1200 BC). This palace remains today in Greece the best preserved palace and one of the most important of all Mycenaean civilization. The remains of the palace consist of the throne room with its foyer, an anteroom, passageways, large warehouses, the external walls of the palace, unique baths, galleries, and 90 meters away from the palace, a beehive tholos tomb (funerary chamber with dome) perfectly restored in 1957 (&quot;Tholos tomb IV)&quot;. Very recently, in 2015, the team of American archaeologists Sharon Stocker and Jack L. Davis of the University of Cincinnati discovered and excavated, near the palace, the tomb of the &quot;Griffin Warrior&quot;, and even more recently in 2017, two other tholos tombs (&quot;Tholos tombs VI and VII&quot;), all three containing a multitude of cultural artifacts and jewels of exceptional delicacy (such as the Pylos Combat Agate or a golden pendant depicting the head of the Egyptian goddess Hathor, which show that Pylos had trading connections, previously unknown, with Egypt and the Near East around 1500 B.C.E). In June 2016, the site reopened to the public after 3 years of work to replace the old roof of the 1960s with a modern structure with elevated walkways for visitors. The archaeological site of the Palace of Nestor can be visited every day, except on holidays and on Tuesdays.

=== The Archaeological Museum of Chora ===

The archaeological museum is located in the center of the village of Chora, located 4 kilometres north of the Palace of Nestor. The museum was built in 1969 to house the artifacts discovered in Nestor&#x27;s Palace and in the rest of the region. However, some of them are currently exposed in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens, in the first room devoted to Mycenaean civilization. The Museum of Chora has three rooms. The first room contains finds almost exclusively from the tombs of the region: pots, weapons and jewelry. The second room contains finds from the region of Englianos and from the Palace of Nestor. In addition to the large storage jars and other ceramics from the palace warehouses, there are some wall frescoes, such as that depicting a lyre player with a bird, as well as war and hunting scenes. In the last room are exposed other finds from the hill of Englianos and the Palace of Nestor and in particular part of the contents of the tombs of this region, such as giant vases, cups and jewelry. The Archaeological Museum of Chora can be visited every day, except on public holidays and on Tuesdays.

=== The lagoon of Gialova and the beaches of Voïdokilia and Divari ===
North of Navarino Bay, near the village of Gialova, the Gialova wetland (&quot;Osman-aga lake&quot;) is one of 10 major lagoons in Greece. Part of the Natura 2000 network, it is considered a place of remarkable natural beauty and as one of the important bird areas in Europe. It has also been listed as a 1500-acre archaeological site, lying between Gialova and the bay of Voidokilia. Its alternative name of &quot;Vivari&quot; is Latin, meaning &#x27;fishponds&#x27;. With a depth, at its deepest point, of no more than four meters, its pond constitutes an ornithological reserve of exceptional importance in Europe, as it is the southernmost stopover of birds migrating between the Balkans and Africa. It gives shelter to no fewer than 270 bird species, among them greater flamingos, glossy ibis, grey herons, great egrets, little egrets, Eurasian curlews, golden plovers, black-winged stilts, great cormorants, common kingfishers, ruffs, garganeys, but also Audouin&#x27;s gulls and birds of prey (lesser kestrels, ospreys, peregrine falcons and imperial eagles). It is Gialova, too, which plays host to a very rare species, nearing extinction throughout Europe, the African chameleon. The observation post of the Greek Ornithological Society allows visitors to find out more and to watch the shallow brackish waters of the lake; they can walk the paths that circumscribe Gialova&#x27;s different ecosystems.At the western end of the lagoon is the small bay of Voidokilia, whose cove-shaped beach is regularly ranked among the most beautiful in the world. It is bordered on one side (to the east) by the Divari lagoon from which it is separated by a dune bank, on the other side (to the west) by the Ionian Sea onto which it opens, and finally on a third side (to the south) by the Navarino bay. The beach is also part of the Natura 2000 network. It is free to access and can be reached by two routes: either by a road from the village of Gialova which crosses the Divari lagoon, or by a path which crosses the village of Petrochori. On the northern promontory at the entrance to the Voidokilia lagoon is a Mycenaean beehive tholos tomb known as &quot;&quot;Thrasymedes&quot;&#x27;, the son of king Nestor. On the heights of the beach, going up towards the &quot;Paleokastro&quot;, is the cave known as &quot;&quot;Cave&quot; &quot;of Nestor&quot;&quot;, in which, according to mythology, the king of Pylos was raising his oxen.

On the way from Voïdokilia to the village of Gialova to the east, an asphalt road follows the narrow strip of land passing between the Divari lagoon and Navarino bay. Along this road is a long white sandy beach which runs along the bay of Navarino: the Beach of the Golden Coast (&quot;Paralia tis Chrysis Aktis&quot;) or Divari beach. It joins to the east another beach, within the village of Gialova, the beach of Gialova.

== Events ==

Since 2017, every year around October 20, the &quot;Navarinia&quot; are organized in memory of the battle of Navarino (20 October 1827) by the municipality of Pylos-Nestor and the volunteers of the local association who is in charge to organize the event. Spread over a period of several days, the celebrations culminate on the anniversary of the battle in the port of Pylos, with the participation of the Hellenic Navy and diplomatic and military representatives of the three Allied countries. Frigates of the Hellenic, British, French and Russian navies, as well as many old sailing ships take part in the reenactment of the famous battle organized with an impressive sound and light show. The evening most often ends with the firing of a reconstructed ship that supposedly took part in the battle and with an impressive fireworks display fired from the port.

The celebrations are also accompanied on previous days by various cultural events that take place in parallel in other parts of the city (ceremonies and tributes to the dead on the various memorials of Pylos and of the region, national and international conferences, parades in the streets of Pylos, traditional musical and dance performances, etc.). Although organized at the end of the touristic season, these celebrations generally attract a large crowd of spectators. In 2019, the demonstrations, which took place in the presence of the President of the Hellenic Republic, gathered more than 10,000 visitors. In 2020, the Navarinia have been awarded the &quot;Gold Tourism Award 2020&quot; in the category Cultural Tourism.

<text>Rocky is a 1976 American independent sports drama film directed by John G. Avildsen and written by and starring Sylvester Stallone. It is the first installment in the &quot;Rocky&quot; franchise and also stars Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, and Burgess Meredith. In the film, Rocky Balboa (Stallone), a poor small-time club fighter and loanshark debt collector from Philadelphia, gets an unlikely shot at the world heavyweight championship held by Apollo Creed (Weathers).

&quot;Rocky&quot; entered development in March 1975, after Stallone wrote the screenplay in three days. It entered a complicated production process after Stallone refused to allow the film to be made without him in the lead role; United Artists eventually agreed to cast Stallone after he rejected a six figure deal for the film rights. Principal photography began in January 1976, with filming primarily held in Philadelphia; several locations featured in the film, such as the Rocky Steps, are now considered cultural landmarks. With an estimated production budget of under $1 million, &quot;Rocky&quot; popularized the rags to riches and American Dream themes of sports dramas which preceded the film.

&quot;Rocky&quot; had its premiere in New York City on November 20, 1976, and was released in the United States on December 3, 1976. &quot;Rocky&quot; became the highest-grossing film of 1976, earning approximately $225 million worldwide. The film received critical acclaim for Stallone&#x27;s writing, as well as the film&#x27;s performances, direction, musical score, cinematography and editing; among other accolades, it received ten Academy Award nominations and won three, including Best Picture. It has been ranked by numerous publications as one of the greatest films of all time, as well as one of the most iconic sports films ever.

&quot;Rocky&quot; and its theme song have become a pop-cultural phenomenon and an important part of 1970s American popular culture. In 2006, the Library of Congress selected &quot;Rocky&quot; for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;. The first sequel in the series, &quot;Rocky II&quot;, was released in 1979.

==Plot==
In 1975, heavyweight boxing world champion Apollo Creed plans to hold a title bout in Philadelphia during the upcoming United States Bicentennial. However, he is informed five weeks from the fight date that his scheduled opponent is unable to compete due to an injured hand, and that all other potential replacements are either booked up or unable to get into shape in time. Having already invested heavily into the fight, Creed decides to give a local contender a chance to challenge him.

Creed selects Rocky Balboa, an Italian-American journeyman southpaw boxer who fights primarily in small gyms and works as a collector for a Mafia loan shark, on the basis of his nickname, &quot;The Italian Stallion&quot;. Rocky fights in a local Philadelphia fight club, and he won his last fight with Spider Rico. He meets with promoter George Jergens, who tells him Creed has selected Rocky to fight him for the World Heavyweight Championship. Reluctant at first, Rocky eventually agrees to the fight, which will pay him $150,000. Rocky undergoes several weeks of unorthodox training, such as using sides of beef as punching bags.

Rocky is later approached by Mickey Goldmill, a former bantamweight fighter-turned-trainer whose gym Rocky frequents, about further training. Rocky is not willing initially, as Mickey has not shown much interest in helping him before and saw him as a wasted talent, but eventually Rocky accepts the offer.

Rocky begins to build a romantic relationship with Adrian Pennino, a shy woman who is working part-time at the J&amp;M Tropical Fish pet store. Adrian&#x27;s brother and Rocky&#x27;s best friend, Paulie, helps Rocky get a date with his sister and offers to work as a cornerman with him for the fight, an offer Rocky turns down. Paulie becomes jealous of Rocky&#x27;s success, but Rocky placates him by agreeing to advertise the meat packing business where Paulie works for sponsorship as part of the upcoming fight, and both of them reconcile. Rocky trains extensively for the championship fight, while Apollo is unconcerned about the match and puts more effort into promotion than training. The night before the match, Rocky visits the Spectrum and begins to lose confidence. He confesses to Adrian that he does not believe he can win, but strives to go the distance against Creed, which no other fighter has done, to prove himself to everyone.

On New Year&#x27;s Day, the fight is held with Creed making a dramatic entrance dressed as George Washington and then Uncle Sam. Taking advantage of his overconfidence, Rocky knocks him down in the first round—the first time that Creed has ever been knocked down. Humbled and worried, Creed takes Rocky more seriously for the rest of the fight, though his ego never fully fades. The fight goes on for the full fifteen rounds, with both combatants sustaining various injuries: Rocky, with hits to the head and swollen eyes, requires his right eyelid to be cut to restore his vision, while Apollo, with internal bleeding and a broken rib, struggles to breathe. As the fight concludes, Creed&#x27;s superior skill is countered by Rocky&#x27;s apparently unlimited ability to absorb punches and his dogged refusal to go down. As the final bell sounds, with both fighters embracing each other, they promise each other there will be no rematch.

The fight is extremely well received by the sportscasters and the audience. Rocky calls out repeatedly for Adrian, who runs down as Paulie distracts security to help her get into the ring. As Jergens declares Creed the winner by virtue of a split decision, Rocky and Adrian embrace and profess their love for each other, not caring about the outcome of the fight.

==Production==
===Development and writing===
Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay for &quot;Rocky&quot; in three and a half days, shortly after watching the championship match between Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner that took place at Richfield Coliseum in Richfield, Ohio, on March 24, 1975. Wepner was TKO&#x27;d in the 15th round of the match by Ali, with few expecting him to last as long as he did. Despite the match motivating Stallone to begin work on &quot;Rocky&quot;, he has denied Wepner provided any inspiration for the script. Other inspiration for the film may have included characteristics of real-life boxers Rocky Marciano and Joe Frazier, as well as Rocky Graziano&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot; and the movie of the same name. Wepner sued Stallone, and eventually settled for an undisclosed amount.

Henry Winkler, Stallone&#x27;s co-star in &quot;The Lords of Flatbush&quot; who then broke out as Arthur Fonzarelli on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Happy Days&quot;, said he had taken the script to executives at the network. They expressed interest in turning it into a made-for-television movie and actually bought the script but insisted that someone else rewrite it. Upon hearing the news, Stallone begged Winkler not to let ABC change writers, so Winkler went back to the executives and offered to return the money in exchange for the rights. While ABC refused at first, Winkler said he was able to use his status as one of its biggest stars at the time to convince them to sell the rights back.

At the time, Film Artists Management Enterprises (FAME), a joint venture between Hollywood talent agents Craig T. Rumar and Larry Kubik, represented Stallone. He submitted his script to Rumar and Kubik, who immediately saw the potential for it to be made into a motion picture. They shopped the script to various producers and studios in Hollywood but were repeatedly rejected because Stallone insisted that he be cast in the lead role. Eventually, they secured a meeting with Winkler-Chartoff productions (no relation to Henry Winkler). After repeated negotiations with Rumar and Kubik, Winkler-Chartoff agreed to a contract for Stallone to be the writer and also star in the lead role for &quot;Rocky&quot;.

United Artists liked Stallone&#x27;s script and viewed it as a vehicle for a well-established star like Robert Redford, Ryan O&#x27;Neal, Burt Reynolds, or James Caan. Stallone&#x27;s agents insisted that Stallone portray the title character, to the point of issuing an ultimatum. Stallone later said that he would never have forgiven himself had the film become a success with somebody else in the lead. He also knew that producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff&#x27;s contract with the studio enabled them to &quot;greenlight&quot; a project if the budget was kept low enough. The producers also collateralized any possible losses with their big-budget entry, &quot;New York, New York&quot; (whose eventual losses were covered by &quot;Rocky&quot; success). The film&#x27;s production budget ended up being $1,075,000, with a further $100,000 spent on producers&#x27; fees and $4.2 million on advertising costs.

===Pre-production===
Although Chartoff and Irwin Winkler were enthusiastic about the script and the idea of Stallone playing the lead character, they were hesitant about having an unknown headline the film. The producers also had trouble casting other major characters in the story, with Apollo Creed and Adrian cast unusually late by the production standards. Real-life boxer Ken Norton was initially sought for the role of Apollo Creed, but he pulled out and the role was ultimately given to Carl Weathers. Norton, upon whom Creed was loosely based, fought Muhammad Ali three times. According to &quot;The Rocky Scrapbook&quot;, Carrie Snodgress was originally chosen to play Adrian, but a money dispute forced the producers to look elsewhere. Susan Sarandon and Cher auditioned for the role but Sarandon was deemed too pretty for the character and Cher too expensive. After Talia Shire&#x27;s ensuing audition, Chartoff and Winkler, and director John Avildsen, insisted that she play the part.

Philadelphia-based boxer Joe Frazier has a cameo appearance in the film. Outspoken boxer Muhammad Ali, who fought Frazier three times, influenced the character of Apollo Creed. During the 49th Academy Awards ceremony in 1977, Ali and Stallone staged a brief comic confrontation to show the film did not offend Ali. Frazier has claimed that some of the plot&#x27;s most memorable moments—Rocky&#x27;s carcass-punching scenes and Rocky running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art as part of his training regimen—are taken without credit from his own real-life exploits.

Because of the film&#x27;s comparatively low budget, members of Stallone&#x27;s family played minor roles. His father rings the bell to signal the start and end of a round; his brother Frank plays a street corner singer, and his first wife, Sasha, was stills photographer. Other cameos include former Philadelphia and then Los Angeles television sportscaster Stu Nahan playing himself, alongside radio and TV broadcaster Bill Baldwin; and Lloyd Kaufman, founder of the independent film company Troma, appearing as a drunk. Diana Lewis, then a news anchor in Los Angeles and later in Detroit, has a minor scene as a TV news reporter. Tony Burton appears as Apollo Creed&#x27;s trainer, Tony &quot;Duke&quot; Evers, a role he would reprise throughout the entire &quot;Rocky&quot; series, though the character is not named until &quot;Rocky II&quot;. Michael Dorn, who would later gain fame as the Klingon Worf in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, made his acting debut, albeit uncredited, as Creed&#x27;s bodyguard.

===Filming===
Principal photography for &quot;Rocky&quot; began on January 9, 1976. Filming took place primarily throughout Philadelphia, with a few scenes being shot in Los Angeles. Rocky&#x27;s house was in E Tusculum St 1818 in Philadelphia. Inventor Garrett Brown&#x27;s new Steadicam was used to accomplish smooth photography while running alongside Rocky during the film&#x27;s Philadelphia street training sequences and the run up the Art Museum&#x27;s flight of stairs, now colloquially known as the Rocky Steps. It was also used for some shots in the fight scenes and can be seen at the ringside during some wide shots of the final fight. &quot;Rocky&quot; is often erroneously cited as the first film to use the Steadicam, although it was actually the third, after &quot;Bound for Glory&quot; and &quot;Marathon Man&quot;.

Certain elements of the story were altered during filming. The original script had a darker tone: Mickey was portrayed as racist, and the script ended with Rocky throwing the fight after realizing he did not want to be part of the professional boxing world after all.

Both Stallone and Weathers suffered injuries during the shooting of the final fight; Stallone suffered bruised ribs and Weathers suffered a damaged nose, the opposite injuries of what their characters had.

The first date between Rocky and Adrian, in which Rocky bribes a janitor to allow them to skate after closing hours on a deserted ice skating rink, was shot that way due to budgetary the scene was originally scheduled to be shot in a public skating rink during regular business hours, but the producers decided they could not afford the hundreds of extras that would have been required.

The poster seen above the ring before Rocky fights Apollo Creed shows Rocky wearing red shorts with a white stripe when he actually wears white shorts with a red stripe. When Rocky points this out, promoter George Jergens tells him that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t really matter, does it?&quot;. Avildsen said this was an actual mistake made by the props department that they could not afford to rectify, so the brief scene was written to ensure the audience did not see it as a goof. Conversely, Stallone has said he was indeed supposed to wear red shorts with a white stripe as Rocky, but changed to the opposite colors &quot;at the last moment&quot;. Similarly, when Rocky&#x27;s robe arrived far too baggy on the day it was needed for filming, Stallone wrote in dialogue where Rocky points this out.

==Music==
===Soundtrack===
Bill Conti composed the musical score for &quot;Rocky&quot;. He had composed a score for director John G. Avildsen&#x27;s &quot;W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings&quot; (1975) that the studio ultimately rejected. David Shire (then-husband of Talia Shire) was the first to be offered the chance to compose the music for &quot;Rocky&quot; but had to turn it down because of prior commitments. Avildsen reached out to Conti without any studio help because of the film&#x27;s relatively low budget. Avildsen said, &quot;The budget for the music was 25 grand. And that was for everything: The composer&#x27;s fee, that was to pay the musicians, that was to rent the studio, that was to buy the tape that it was going to be recorded on.&quot;

The main theme song, &quot;Gonna Fly Now&quot;, made it to number one on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hot 100 list for one week (from July 2 to July 8, 1977) and the American Film Institute placed it 58th on its AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs. United Artists Records released the soundtrack album on November 12, 1976. EMI re-released the album on CD and cassette.

Frank Stallone&#x27;s song &quot;Take You Back&quot; is also on the soundtrack, and he also sings the song in the movie with other friends around a trash can fire.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Rocky&quot; grossed $5,488 on its opening day at Cinema II, a house record. When it was released nationally, it grossed $5 million during its first wide weekend and consistently performed well for eight months and eventually reached $117 million at the North American box office. Adjusted for inflation in 2018, the film earned over $500 million in North America alone. Overseas, &quot;Rocky&quot; grossed $107 million, for a worldwide box office total of $225 million. With its production budget of just under $1 million, &quot;Rocky&quot; is notable for its worldwide percentage return of over 11,000 percent. It was the highest-grossing film released in 1976 in the United States and Canada and the second highest-grossing film of 1977, behind &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

===Critical response===
&quot;Rocky&quot; received positive reviews at the time of its release. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it 4 out of 4 stars and said that Stallone reminded him of &quot;the young Marlon Brando.&quot; &quot;Box Office Magazine&quot; claimed audiences would be &quot;touting Sylvester &#x27;Sly&#x27; Stallone as a new star&quot;. Frank Rich liked the film, calling it &quot;almost 100 per cent schmaltz&quot;, but favoring it over the cynicism that was prevalent in movies at that time, although he referred to the plot as &quot;gimmicky&quot; and the script &quot;heavy-handed&quot;. Several reviews, including Richard Eder&#x27;s (as well as Canby&#x27;s negative review), compared the work to that of Frank Capra.

The film did not escape criticism. Vincent Canby, of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called it &quot;pure &#x27;30s make believe&quot; and dismissed both Stallone&#x27;s acting and Avildsen&#x27;s directing, calling the latter &quot;none too decisive&quot;. Andrew Sarris found the Capra comparisons disingenuous: &quot;Capra&#x27;s movies projected more despair deep down than a movie like &quot;Rocky&quot; could envisage, and most previous ring movies have been much more cynical about the fight scene&quot;; commenting on Rocky&#x27;s work for a loan shark, Sarris says the film &quot;teeters on the edge of sentimentalizing gangsters&quot;. He found Meredith &quot;oddly cast in the kind of part the late James Gleason used to pick his teeth&quot;.

One of the positive online reviews came from the BBC Films website, with both reviewer Almar Haflidason and BBC online users giving it 5 out of 5 stars.

The film enjoys a reputation as a classic and still receives nearly universal praise. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 93% approval rating based on 75 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus states: &quot;This story of a down-on-his-luck boxer is thoroughly predictable, but Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s script and stunning performance in the title role brush aside complaints.&quot;

==Other media==
===Sequels===

The film&#x27;s success led to eight sequels, beginning with &quot;Rocky II&quot; in 1979. Followed by &quot;Rocky III&quot; in 1982, &quot;Rocky IV&quot; in 1985, &quot;Rocky V&quot; in 1990, &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot; in 2006, &quot;Creed&quot; in 2015 and &quot;Creed II&quot; in 2018. Another sequel, titled &quot;Creed III&quot;, was released in 2023; however, Stallone did not appear in the film.

===Possible prequel===
In July 2019, Stallone said in an interview that there have been ongoing discussions about a prequel to the original film based on the life of a young Rocky Balboa.

===Rocky Steps===

The famous scene of Rocky running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art has become a cultural icon, with the steps acquiring the vernacular title of &quot;Rocky Steps&quot;. In 1982, a statue of Rocky, commissioned by Stallone for &quot;Rocky III&quot;, was placed at the top of the Rocky Steps. City Commerce Director Dick Doran claimed that Stallone and Rocky had done more for the city&#x27;s image than &quot;anyone since Ben Franklin&quot;.

Differing opinions of the statue and its placement led to a relocation to the sidewalk outside the Spectrum Arena, although the statue was temporarily returned to the top of the steps in 1990 for &quot;Rocky V&quot;, and again in 2006 for the 30th anniversary of the original &quot;Rocky&quot; (although this time it was placed at the bottom of the steps). Later that year, it was moved permanently to a spot next to the steps.

The scene is frequently parodied in other media. In the 2008 movie &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess with the Zohan&quot;, Zohan&#x27;s nemesis, Phantom, goes through a parody training sequence finishing with him running up a desert dune and raising his hands in victory. In the fourth-season finale of &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, as the credits roll at the end of the episode, Will is seen running up the steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art; however, as he celebrates after finishing his climb, he passes out in exhaustion, and while he lies unconscious on the ground, a pickpocket steals his wallet and his wool hat. In &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;, there is a scene where Sherman Klump (Eddie Murphy) struggles to, and eventually succeeds at, running up a lengthy flight of steps on his college campus, victoriously throwing punches at the top.

In 2006, E! named the &quot;Rocky Steps&quot; scene number 13 on its 101 Most Awesome Moments in Entertainment list.

During the 1996 Summer Olympics torch relay, Philadelphia native Dawn Staley was chosen to run up the museum steps. In 2004, presidential candidate John Kerry ended his pre-convention campaign at the foot of the steps before going to Boston to accept his party&#x27;s nomination for president.

===Novelization===
Upon the film&#x27;s release, a paperback novelization of the screenplay written by Rosalyn Drexler under the pseudonym Julia Sorel and published by Ballantine Books was released.

===Video games===

Several video games have been produced based on the film. &quot;Rocky&quot; was released in 1987 for the Master System. &quot;Rocky&quot; was released in 2002 for the GameCube, Game Boy Advance, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, and a sequel, &quot;Rocky Legends&quot;, was released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. In 2016, Tapinator released a mobile game named &quot;ROCKY&quot; for the iOS platform, with a planned 2017 release for Google Play and Amazon platforms.

===Musical===

A musical was written by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens (lyrics and music), with the book by Thomas Meehan, based on the film. The musical premiered in Hamburg, Germany in October 2012. It began performances at the Winter Garden Theater on Broadway on February 11, 2014, and officially opened on March 13, 2014.

=== Documentaries ===
&quot;Rocky&quot; is featured in the 2017 documentary &quot;John G. Avildsen: King of the Underdogs&quot; about Academy Award-winning &quot;Rocky&quot; director John G. Avildsen, directed and produced by Derek Wayne Johnson.

Stallone later hand-picked Johnson to direct and produce a documentary on the making of the original &quot;Rocky&quot;, entitled &quot;40 Years of Rocky: The Birth of a Classic&quot;, which was released in 2020. The documentary features Stallone narrating behind-the-scenes footage from the making of the film.

=== Parodies ===
&quot;Rocky&quot; has been parodied a lot over the years, even getting a feature length spoof called &quot;Ricky 1&quot; in 1988.
In 1986, Aki Kaurismaki, a Finnish director, made an 8-minute spoof of Rocky IV called &quot;Rocky VI&quot;.

=== National Museum of American History ===
The red satin robe and black hat worn by Stallone in &quot;Rocky&quot; are featured in the National Museum of American History. Likewise, the red gloves worn by Stallone in &quot;Rocky II&quot; (1979), his white Nike boxing shoes, and striped boxing trunks from &quot;Rocky III&quot; (1981) are archived at the museum. All items were on display for a temporary period following Stallone&#x27;s donation in 2006, and have since been moved to the museum archives.

<text>Kinshasa (; ; ), formerly named Léopoldville from 1881–1966, is the capital and largest city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Kinshasa is one of the world&#x27;s fastest-growing megacities, with an estimated population of 17,032,322 in 2024. It is the most densely populated city in the DRC, the most populous city in Africa, the world&#x27;s fourth-most-populous capital city, Africa&#x27;s third-largest metropolitan area, the world&#x27;s twenty-second most populous city and the leading economic, political, and cultural center of the DRC. Kinshasa houses several industries, including manufacturing, telecommunications, banking, and entertainment. The city also hosts some of DRC&#x27;s significant institutional buildings, such as the People&#x27;s Palace, Palace of the Nation, Court of Cassation, Constitutional Court, African Union City, Marble Palace, Martyrs Stadium, Government House, Kinshasa Financial Center, and other national departments and agencies.

Covering 9,965 square kilometers, Kinshasa stretches along the southern shores of the Pool Malebo on the Congo River. It forms an expansive crescent across flat, low-lying terrain at an average altitude of about 300 meters. Situated between latitudes 4° and 5° and longitudes East 15° and 16°32, Kinshasa shares its borders with the Mai-Ndombe Province, Kwilu Province, and Kwango Province to the east; the Congo River delineates its western and northern perimeters, constituting a natural border with the Republic of the Congo; to the south lies the Kongo Central Province. Across the river sits Brazzaville, the smaller capital of the neighboring Republic of the Congo, forming the world&#x27;s second-closest pair of capital cities despite being separated by a four-kilometer-wide unbridged span of the Congo River.

Kinshasa also functions as one of the 26 provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is administratively divided into 24 communes, which are further subdivided into 365 neighborhoods. With an expansive administrative region, over 90 percent of the province&#x27;s land remains rural, while urban growth predominantly occurs on its western side. Kinshasa is the largest nominally Francophone urban area globally, with French being the language of government, education, media, public services and high-end commerce, while Lingala is used as a lingua franca in the street. The city&#x27;s inhabitants are popularly known as &quot;Kinois&quot;, with the term &quot;Kinshasans&quot; used in English terminology.

The Kinshasa site has been inhabited by Bantus (Teke, ) for centuries and was known as &quot;Nshasa&quot; before transforming into a commercial hub during the 19th and 20th centuries. The city was named Léopoldville by Henry Morton Stanley in honor of Leopold II of Belgium. The name was changed to Kinshasa in 1966 during Mobutu Sese Seko&#x27;s &quot;Zairianisation&quot; campaign as a tribute to &quot;Nshasa&quot; village.

The National Museum of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is DRC&#x27;s most prominent and central museum, housing a collection of art, artifacts, historical objects, and modern work of arts. The College of Advanced Studies in Strategy and Defense is the highest military institution in DRC and Central Africa. The National Pedagogical University is DRC&#x27;s first pedagogical university and one of Africa&#x27;s top pedagogical universities. N&#x27;Djili International Airport is the largest airport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and ranks 37th in Africa in terms of passengers carried, with 12 international flights per day. In December 2015, Kinshasa was designated as a City of Music by UNESCO and has been a member of the Creative Cities Network since then. Nsele Valley Park is the largest urban park in Kinshasa, housing a range of fauna and flora. According to the 2016 annual ranking, Kinshasa is Africa&#x27;s most expensive city for expatriate employees, ahead of close to 200 global locations.

== Toponymy ==
The origin of the name &quot;Kinshasa&quot; is rooted in multiple theories proposed by scholars. Paul Raymaekers, an anthropologist and ethnologist, suggests that the name derives from the combination of the Kikongo and Kihumbu languages. The prefix &quot;&quot;Ki(n)&quot; signifies a hill or inhabited area, while &quot;Nsasa&quot; or &quot;Nshasa&quot;&quot; refers to a bag of salt. According to Raymackers, &quot;Kinshasa&quot; was a significant trading site where people from the Lower Congo (now Kongo Central Province) and South Atlantic Ocean exchanged salt for goods like iron, slaves and ivory brought by those from the Upper Congo (now Tshopo Province). However, Hendrik van Moorsel, an anthropologist, historian and researcher, proposes that Bateke fishermen traded fish for cassava with locals along the riverbank, and the place of this exchange was called &quot;Ulio&quot;. In Teke, &quot;exchange&quot; is &quot;Utsaya&quot;, and &quot;place of exchange&quot; is &quot;Intsaya&quot;. Thus, the name evolved from &quot;Ulio&quot; to &quot;Intsaya&quot;, and later, under the influence of Kikongo, transformed into &quot;Kintsaya&quot;, eventually becoming &quot;Kinshasa&quot;. &quot;Kinshasa&quot;, also known as &quot;N&#x27;shasa&quot;, is regarded as the primary &quot;place of exchange&quot; on the southern bank of the Pool Malebo, where bartering occurred even before the commercial boom of Kintambo.

The name &quot;Nshasa&quot; is believed to originate from the Teke verb &quot;tsaya&quot; (&quot;tsaa&quot;), meaning &quot;to exchange&quot;, and the noun &quot;intsaya&quot; (&quot;insaa&quot;), referring to any market or place of exchange. It was at this location that Teke brokers traded ivory and slaves from the Banunu slave traders, often mistaken for the Yanzi, for European trade items brought by the Zombo and Kongo people. Despite the various theories, the historical name of &quot;Kinshasa&quot; is known to have been &quot;Nshasa&quot;, as documented by Henry Morton Stanley during his crossing of Africa from Zanzibar to Boma in 1874–1877 when he mentioned visiting &quot;the king of Nshasa&quot; on 14 March 1877.

==History==


Prior to the establishment of Kinshasa, the area was for a time part of the Anziku Kingdom. By about 1698, it had become an essentially independent domain known as Nkonkobela.

The city was established as a trading post by Henry Morton Stanley in 1881. It was named Léopoldville in honor of Stanley&#x27;s employer King Leopold II of the Belgians. He would then proceed to take control of most of the Congo Basin as the Congo Free State, not as a colony but as his private property. The post flourished as the first navigable port on the Congo River above Livingstone Falls, a series of rapids over below Leopoldville. At first, all goods arriving by sea or being sent by sea had to be carried by porters between Léopoldville and Matadi, the port below the rapids and from the coast. The completion of the Matadi-Kinshasa portage railway, in 1898, provided an alternative route around the rapids and sparked the rapid development of Léopoldville. In 1914, a pipeline was installed so that crude oil could be transported from Matadi to the upriver steamers in Leopoldville. By 1923, the city was elevated to capital of the Belgian Congo, replacing the town of Boma in the Congo estuary, pursuant to the Royal Decree of 1 July 1923, countersigned by the Minister of the Colonies, Louis Franc. Before this, Léopoldville was designated an &quot;urban district&quot;, encompassing exclusively the communes of Kintambo and the current Gombe, which burgeoned around Ngaliema Bay. Then the communes of Kinshasa, Barumbu, and Lingwala emerged. In the 1930s, these communes predominantly housed employees of Chanic, Filtisaf, and Utex Africa.

In 1941, legislative ordinance n°293/AIMO of 25 June 1941, conferred Kinshasa the status of a city and established an Urban Committee (&quot;Comité Urbain&quot;), with an allocated area of 5,000 hectares and a population of 53,000. Concurrently, it became the colony&#x27;s capital, the Congo-Kasaï Province&#x27;s capital, and the Moyen Congo district. The city was demarcated into two zones: the urban zone, comprising Léo II, Léo-Ouest, Kalina, Léo-I, or Léo-Est, and Ndolo; and the indigenous zone to the south. The urban populace swelled in 1945 with the cessation of forced labor, facilitating the influx of native Africans from rural regions. Léopoldville then became predominantly inhabited by the Bakongo ethnic group.

In the 1950s, planned urban centers such as Lemba, Matete, and a segment of Ndjili were established to accommodate workers from the Limete industrial zone. Lovanium University, the colony&#x27;s inaugural university, was founded in 1954. By 1957, Léopoldville comprised eleven communes and six adjunct regions: Kalamu, Dendale (present-day Kasa-Vubu commune), Saint Jean (now Lingwala), Ngiri-Ngiri, Kintambo, Limete, Bandalungwa, Léopoldville (current Gombe), Barumbu, Kinshasa, and Ngaliema; along with the adjunct regions of Lemba, Binza, Makala, Kimwenza, Kimbanseke, and Kingasani. Subsequently, the adjunct regions of Ndjili and Matete were incorporated.

After gaining its independence on 30 June 1960, following riots in 1959, the Republic of the Congo elected its first prime minister, Patrice Lumumba whose perceived pro-Soviet leanings were viewed as a threat by Western interests. This being the height of the Cold War, the U.S. and Belgium did not want to lose control of the strategic wealth of the Congo, in particular its uranium. Less than a year after Lumumba&#x27;s election, the Belgians and the U.S. bought the support of his Congolese rivals and set in motion the events that culminated in Lumumba&#x27;s assassination. In 1964, Moïse Tshombe decreed the expulsion of all nationals of Republic of the Congo, Burundi and Mali, as well as all political refugees from Rwanda. In 1965, with the help of the U.S. and Belgium, Joseph-Désiré Mobutu seized power in the Congo. He initiated a policy of &quot;Authenticity&quot;, attempting to renativize the names of people and places in the country. On 2 May 1966, the government announced that the nation&#x27;s major cities would be restored to their pre-colonial names, effective on 30 June, the sixth anniversary of independence. Léopoldville was renamed &quot;Kinshasa&quot;, for a village named Kinshasa that once stood near the site. Kinshasa grew rapidly under Mobutu, drawing people from across the country who came in search of their fortunes or to escape ethnic strife elsewhere, thus adding to the many ethnicities and languages already found there.

In 1991 the city had to fend off rioting soldiers, who were protesting the government&#x27;s failure to pay them. Subsequently a rebel uprising began, which in 1997 finally brought down the regime of Mobutu. Kinshasa suffered greatly from Mobutu&#x27;s excesses, mass corruption, nepotism and the civil war that led to his downfall. Nevertheless, it is still a major cultural and intellectual center for Central Africa, with a flourishing community of musicians and artists. It is also the country&#x27;s major industrial center, processing many of the natural products brought from the interior.

Joseph Kabila, president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 2001 to 2019, was not overly popular in Kinshasa. Violence broke out following the announcement of Kabila&#x27;s victory in the contested election of 2006; the European Union deployed troops (EUFOR RD Congo) to join the UN force in the city. The announcement in 2016 that a new election would be delayed two years led to large protests in September and December which involved barricades in the streets and left dozens of people dead. Schools and businesses were closed down.

==Geography==

=== Location ===
Kinshasa is strategically situated on the southern bank of the expansive Malebo Pool, spanning 9,965 square kilometers, configured in a grand crescent shape atop a low-lying, flat terrain with an average elevation hovering around 300 meters. Positioned between latitudes 4° and 5° and longitudinal coordinates 15° to 16°32 east, Kinshasa is flanked by the provinces of Mai-Ndombe, Kwilu, and Kwango to the east, while the Congo River delineates its western and northern boundaries, naturally demarcating the border with the Republic of the Congo. To the south, it is demarcated by the Kongo Central Province.

The Congo River is the second longest river in Africa after the Nile and has the continent&#x27;s greatest discharge. As a waterway it provides a means of transport for much of the Congo Basin; it is navigable for river barges between Kinshasa and Kisangani; many of its tributaries are also navigable. The river is an important source of hydroelectric power, and downstream from Kinshasa it has the potential to generate power equivalent to the usage of roughly half of Africa&#x27;s population.

=== Relief ===

Topographically, Kinshasa has a marshy, alluvial plain, with altitudes ranging from 275 to 300 meters, along with hilly terrain that elevates from 310 to 370 meters. The city has four principal features: the Malebo Pool, a vast expanse of water with islands and islets; the Kinshasa Plain, which is a highly urbanizable space, but susceptible to drainage issues; the Terrace, which is a series of low ridges overlooking the plain; and the Hills Area, which is characterized by deep valleys and cirque-shaped formations.

The Malebo Pool spans over 35 kilometers in length and 25 kilometers in width and is encircled by Ngaliema Municipality to the west and Maluku Municipality to the east, traversing through Gombe, Barumbu, Limete, Masina, and Nsele municipalities. The Kinshasa Plain has a banana-like shape and is surrounded by eastward-oriented hills. Its low sandy alluvial masses extend from Maluku Municipality in the east to the western foothills of Ngaliema, covering approximately 20,000 hectares.

The Terrace is mainly situated in the city&#x27;s western expanse, between N&#x27;djili and Mount Ngafula. It comprises stony blocks of soft sandstone and silica-covered yellow clay, topped with brown silt, and ranges from 10 to 25 meters in height. It retains vestiges of an ancient surface. The Hills Area commences several kilometers from the Malebo Pool and is characterized by deep valleys and cirque-shaped formations. These hills reach heights surpassing 700 meters and exhibit gentle, rounded contours sculpted by local rivers. While their eastern counterparts may reflect remnants of the Batéké Plateau, their origins in the west and south remain enigmatic. Their natural erosion processes are exacerbated by human intervention, sometimes assuming catastrophic proportions.

=== Hydrography ===

Kinshasa&#x27;s hydrographic network encompasses the Congo River and its principal left bank tributaries, traversing the city from south to north. These include the Lukunga, Ndjili, Nsele, Bombo, or Mai-Ndombe rivers and the Mbale. Unfortunately, these waterways are polluted due to the city&#x27;s demographic pressures and inadequate sanitation.

=== Geology ===
Geologically, the soil in Kinshasa is of the Arenoferrasol category, characterized by fine sands with a clay content typically below 20%, low organic matter, and absorbent complex saturation. The basement is composed of Precambrian bedrock, featuring finely stratified red sandstone often infused with feldspar. This rock is visible at the rapids&#x27; base near Mount Ngaliema and south of the N&#x27;djili River, and effectively withstands erosive forces.

=== Vegetation ===
Kinshasa&#x27;s vegetation comprises gallery forests, grassy formations, ruderal plant groups, and aquatic formations. These gallery forests, found along the main watercourses within humid valleys of the Congolese guinéo ombrophile type, have degraded into highly exploited pre-forest fallows, manifesting as reclusive foresters of varying ages. Ruderal plant groups line railway tracks within narrow strips, reflecting the region&#x27;s vegetation cover&#x27;s discontinuity and repetition. Kinshasa is home to diverse vegetation types, each intricately linked to specific ecological parameters.

=== Residential and commercial areas ===
Kinshasa is a city of sharp contrasts, with affluent residential and commercial areas and three universities alongside sprawling slums. The older and wealthier part of the city (&quot;ville basse&quot;) is located on a flat area of alluvial sand and clay near the river, while many newer areas are found on the eroding red soil of surrounding hills. Older parts of the city were laid out on a geometric pattern, with &quot;de facto&quot; racial segregation becoming &quot;de jure&quot; in 1929 as the European and African neighborhoods grew closer together. City plans of the 1920s–1950s featured a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; or buffer between the white and black neighborhoods, which included the central market as well as parks and gardens for Europeans.

Urban planning in post-independence Kinshasa has been limited. The &quot;Mission Française d&#x27;Urbanisme&quot; drew up some plans in the 1960s which envisioned a greater role for automobile transportation but did not predict the city&#x27;s significant population growth. Thus much of the urban structure has developed without guidance from a master plan. According to UN-Habitat, the city is expanding by eight square kilometers per year. It describes many of the new neighborhoods as slums, built in unsafe conditions with inadequate infrastructure. Nevertheless, spontaneously developed areas have in many cases extended the grid street plan of the original city.

===Administrative divisions===


Kinshasa is both a city (&quot;ville&quot; in French) and a province, one of the 26 provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Nevertheless, it has city subdivisions and is divided into 24 communes (municipalities), which in turn are divided into 369 quarters and 21 embedded groupings. Maluku, the rural commune to the east of the urban area, accounts for 79% of the total land area of the city-province, with a population of 200,000–300,000. The communes are grouped into four districts which are not in themselves administrative divisions.
* Funa District
** Bandalungwa
** Bumbu
** Kalamu
** Kasa-Vubu
** Makala
** Ngiri-Ngiri
** Selembao
* Lukunga District
** Barumbu
** Gombe
** Kinshasa
** Kintambo
** Lingwala
** Mont Ngafula
** Ngaliema
* Mont Amba District
** Kisenso
** Lemba
** Limete
** Matete
** Ngaba
* Tshangu District
** Kimbanseke
** Maluku
** Masina
** Ndjili (N&#x27;Djili)
** Nsele (N&#x27;Sele)


===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Kinshasa has a tropical wet and dry climate (&quot;Aw&quot;). Its lengthy rainy season spans from October through May, with a relatively short dry season, between June and September. Kinshasa lies south of the equator, so its dry season begins around its winter solstice, which is in June. This is in contrast to African cities further north featuring this climate where the dry season typically begins around December. Kinshasa&#x27;s dry season is slightly cooler than its wet season, though temperatures remain relatively constant throughout the year.

=== Parks and gardens ===
Kinshasa is home to a diverse range of parks and gardens:
* Nsele Valley Park, the largest urban park in the city situated along the Nsele River, offers a setting for outdoor activities. It features picnic areas, walking trails, and viewpoints overlooking the river. 
* Parc Présidentiel, situated along the Congo River, is a park in Kinshasa. The park offers ponds, pools, and fountains, while the Théâtre de Verdure serve as venues for cultural performances. The park&#x27;s mini zoo has a diverse array of animals.
* Jardin Zoologique, located in the heart of Gombe commune, is a zoo in Kinshasa. The zoo houses a wide variety of mammals, reptiles, and birds, offering an educational and entertaining experience.
* Jardin Botanique de Kinshasa, situated in Gombe, is a botanical garden that showcases the city&#x27;s botanical treasures. The botanical garden houses an array of plants and colorful flowers.
* Lola ya Bonobo, located south of Kinshasa, is the world&#x27;s only sanctuary for orphaned bonobos. Situated at the Petites Chutes de la Lukaya, it provides a safe and nurturing environment for endangered primates.

==Demographics==

An official census conducted in 1984 counted 2.6 million residents. Since then, all estimates are extrapolations. The estimates for 2005 fell in a range between 5.3 million and 7.3 million. In 2017, the most recent population estimate for the city, it has a population of 11,855,000.

According to UN-Habitat, 390,000 people immigrate to Kinshasa annually, fleeing warfare and seeking economic opportunity.

According to a projection (2016) the population of metropolitan Kinshasa will increase significantly, to 35 million by 2050, 58 million by 2075 and 83 million by 2100, making it one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world.

===Language===
The official language of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, of which Kinshasa is the capital, is French (See: Kinshasa French vocabulary). Kinshasa is the largest officially Francophone city in the world, albeit that the vast majority of people either cannot speak French, or struggle in speaking it. Although Lingala is widely used as a spoken language, French is the language of street signs, posters, newspapers, government documents, schools; it dominates plays, television, and the press, and it is used in vertical relationships among people of different social classes. People of the same class, however, speak the Congolese languages (Kikongo, Lingala, Tshiluba or Swahili) among themselves. Kinshasa hosted the 14th Francophonie Summit in October 2012.

== Government and politics ==

The head of Kinshasa &quot;ville-province&quot; has the title of Gouverneur. has been governor since 21 June 2024. Each commune has its own Bourgmestre.

Although political power in the DRC is fragmented, Kinshasa as the national capital represents the official center of sovereignty, and thus of access to international organizations and financing, and of political powers such as the right to issue passports. Kinshasa is also the primate city of the DRC with a population several times larger than the next-largest city, Lubumbashi.

The United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, known by its French acronym MONUSCO (formerly MONUC) has its headquarters in Kinshasa. In 2016, the UN placed more peacekeepers on active duty in Kinshasa in response to the unrest directed against Kabila, at that time. Critics, including recently the US ambassador to the UN, have accused the peacekeeping mission of supporting a corrupt government.

Other non-governmental organizations play significant roles in local governance. Since 2016, the Belgian development agency (&quot;Coopération technique belge&quot;; CTB) has sponsored the &quot;Programme d&#x27;Appui aux Initiatives de Développement Communautaire&quot; (Paideco), a 6-million-euro program aimed at economic development. It began work in Kimbanseke, a hill commune with population verging on one million.

==Economy==
=== Mining sector and export growth ===
In 2022, Kinshasa&#x27;s GDP exceeded initial expectations by expanding 8.5%, as reported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The mining industry in the DRC has been instrumental in maintaining a positive economic outlook, even amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Raw material exports, particularly cobalt and copper, have experienced historically high prices, resulting in substantial investment in the industry. Parenthetically, production has increased, and Covid-related restrictions have eased, leading to sustained economic growth.

=== Fiscal performance and debt sustainability ===
Despite facing external challenges, including the repercussions of the Russo-Ukrainian War, the DRC has shown fiscal stability. In 2022, tax performance exceeded projections, showcasing improved revenue generation. However, increased expenditures related to security concerns and internal arrears resulted in a deterioration of the overall budget balance. Nevertheless, the DRC&#x27;s debt risk remains moderate, with public debt at 24.7% of GDP. The approval of the third review of the IMF program reflects the satisfactory performance of the country&#x27;s reform efforts.

=== Companies, foreign exchange reserves, international support ===

Big manufacturing companies such as Marsavco S.A., All Pack Industries and Angel Cosmetics are located in the center of town (Gombe) in Kinshasa.

There are many other industries, such as Trust Merchant Bank, located in the heart of the city. Food processing is a major industry, and construction and other service industries also play a significant role in the economy.

Although home to only 13% of the DRC&#x27;s population, Kinshasa accounts for 85% of the Congolese economy as measured by gross domestic product. A 2004 investigation found 70% of inhabitants employed informally, 17% in the public sector, 9% in the formal private sector, and 3% other, of a total 976,000 workers. Most new jobs are classified as informal. By the end of 2022, Kinshasa&#x27;s foreign exchange reserves had seen a significant improvement, soaring past $4.5 billion. The DRC benefits from support and partnerships with several global organizations and financial institutions, including the IMF, World Bank, African Development Bank, European Union, China and France.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China has been heavily involved in the Congo since the 1970s, when they financed the construction of the Palais du Peuple and backed the government against rebels in the Shaba war. In 2007–2008 China and Congo signed an agreement for an $8.5 billion loan for infrastructure development. Chinese entrepreneurs are gaining an increasing share of local marketplaces in Kinshasa, displacing in the process formerly successful Congolese, West African, Indian, and Lebanese merchants.

Mean household spending in 2005 was the equivalent of US$2,150, amounting to $1 per day per person. The median household spending was $1,555, 66 cents per person per day. Among the poor, more than half of this spending goes to food, especially bread and cereal.

==Education==

Kinshasa is home to several education institutes, covering a wide range of disciplines, including civil engineering, nursing, and journalism. The city is also home to three large universities and an arts school:
* Académie de Design (AD)
* Institut Supérieur d&#x27;Architecture et Urbanisme
* Pan-African University of the Congo
* University of Kinshasa
* Université Libre de Kinshasa
* Congo Protestant University
* Université Chretienne de Kinshasa
* National Pedagogy University
* National Institute of Arts
* Institut Supérieur de Publicité et Médias
* Centre for Health Training (CEFA)

Primary and secondary schools:
* Lycée Prince de Liège (primary and secondary education, French Community of Belgium curriculum)
* Prins van Luikschool Kinshasa (primary education, Flanders curriculum)
*Lycée Français René Descartes (primary and secondary education, French curriculum)
* The American School of Kinshasa
* Allhadeff School

The education system in DRC is plagued by low coverage, low quality and poor educational infrastructure, especially in rural areas. According to USAID (2018), 3.5 million children of primary school age are out of school, and 44% of those who do attend school started only after age six. Various statistical estimates by UNESCO, (2013) regarding secondary and tertiary education also reveal the difficulties facing the country. In DRC it is difficult to get a reliable estimate on the actual proportion of the population who can read and write, however, according to data from UIS (2016), the literacy rate of the population of 15 years and older in the country, is estimated to 77.04%. This rate is 88.5% for men and 66.5% for women. There is also a shortage of reading material, and certainly no culture of reading for pleasure.

==Health and medicine==

There are twenty hospitals in Kinshasa, plus various medical centers and polyclinics.

== Culture ==
Located in Kinshasa are the National Museum and the Kinshasa Fine Arts Academy.

Kinshasa has a flourishing music scene which, since the 1960s, has operated under the patronage of the city&#x27;s elite. The Orchestre Symphonique Kimbanguiste, formed in 1994, began using improved musical instruments and has since grown in means and reputation.

A pop culture ideal type in Kinshasa is the &quot;mikiliste&quot;, a fashionable person with money who has traveled to Europe. Adrien Mombele, a.k.a. Stervos Niarcos, and musician Papa Wemba were early exemplars of the mikiliste style. La Sape, a linked cultural trend also described as dandyism, involves wearing flamboyant clothing.

Many Kinois have a negative view of the city, expressing nostalgia for the rural way of life, and a stronger association with the Congolese nation than with Kinshasa.

== Places of worship ==
Among the places of worship, which are predominantly Christian churches and temples: Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kinshasa (Catholic Church), Kimbanguist Church, Baptist Community of Congo (Baptist World Alliance), Baptist Community of the Congo River (Baptist World Alliance), The Salvation Army, Assemblies of God, Province of the Anglican Church of the Congo (Anglican Communion), The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which has a temple and over 100 congregations in Kinshasa, Presbyterian Community in Congo (World Communion of Reformed Churches). There are also Muslim mosques. A Baha&#x27;i House of Worship is in construction. A Jewish synagogue, operated by the Chabad world movement, exists.

==Media==
Press freedom is very low in the DRC, especially in Kinshasa. State run channels report little political news. Journalism is strictly controlled, with DRC scoring only 48.55% on the Press Freedom Index, in 2023.
Nevertheless, Kinshasa is home to several media outlets, including radio and television stations, including state-run Radio-Télévision nationale congolaise (RTNC) and privately run Digital Congo and Raga TV. 

Several national radio stations, including La Voix du Congo, which is operated by RTNC, UN-backed Radio Okapi are based in Kinshasa, as well as numerous local stations. The BBC is also available in Kinshasa on 92.6 FM.

The state-controlled Agence Congolaise de Presse news agency is based in Kinshasa, as well as several daily and weekly newspapers and news websites, including &quot;L&#x27;Avenir&quot; (daily), &quot;La Conscience&quot;, &quot;LeCongolais&quot; (online),&quot;L&#x27;Observateur&quot; (daily), &quot;Le Phare&quot;, &quot;Le Potentiel&quot;, and &quot;Le Soft&quot;.

Most of the media use French and Lingala to a large extent; very few use the other national languages.

== Sports ==

Sports, especially football and martial arts are popular in Kinshasa. The city is home to the country&#x27;s national stadium, the Stade des Martyrs (Stadium of the Martyrs). The Vita Club, Daring Club Motema Pembe and AS Dragons frequently draws large crowds, enthusiastic and sometimes rowdy, to the Stade des Martyrs. Dojos are popular and their owners influential.

In 1974, Kinshasa hosted The Rumble in the Jungle boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, in which Ali defeated Foreman, to regain the World Heavyweight title.

==Buildings and institutions==
Kinshasa is home to the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo including:

* the Palais de la Nation, home of the President, in Gombe;
* the Palais du Peuple, meeting place of both houses of Parliament, Senate and National Assembly, in Lingwala;
* the Palais de Justice, in Gombe;
* the Cité de l&#x27;OUA, built for the Organization of African Unity in the 1970s and now serving government functions, in Ngaliema.

The Central Bank of the Congo has its headquarters on Boulevard Colonel Tshatshi, across the street from the Mausoleum of Laurent Kabila and the presidential palace.

Notable features of the city include the Gecamines Commercial Building (formerly SOZACOM) and Hotel Memling; L&#x27;ONATRA, the building of the Ministry of Transport; the central market; the Limete Tower.

== Infrastructure and housing ==
The city&#x27;s infrastructure for running water and electricity is generally in bad shape. The electrical network is in disrepair to the extent that prolonged and periodic blackouts are normal, and exposed lines sometimes electrify pools of rainwater.

Regideso, the national public company with primary responsibility for water supply in the Congo, serves Kinshasa only incompletely, and without uniform quality. 
Other areas are served by decentralized &quot;Associations des Usagers des Réseau d&#x27;Eau Potable&quot; (ASUREPs). Gombe uses water at a high rate (306 liters per day per inhabitant) compared to other communes (from 71 L/d/i in Kintambo down to 2 L/d/i in Kimbanseke).

The city is estimated to produce 6,300 m3 of trash and 1,300 m3 of industrial waste per day, with little to no capacity for disposal.

The housing market has seen rising prices and rents since the 1980s. Houses and apartments in the central area are expensive, with houses selling for a million dollars and apartments going for $5000 per month. High prices have spread outward from the central area as owners and renters move out of the most expensive part of the city. Gated communities and shopping malls, built with foreign capital and technical expertise, began to appear in 2006. Urban renewal projects have led in some cases to violent conflict and displacement. The high prices leave incoming refugees with few options for settlement besides illegal shantytowns such as Pakadjuma.

In 2005, 55% of households had televisions and 43% had mobile phones. 11% had refrigerators and 5% had cars.

==Transport==

The city-province has 5000 km of roadways, 10% of which are paved. The Boulevard du 30 Juin (Boulevard of 30 June) links the main areas of the central district of the city. Other roads also converge on Gombe. The east–west road network linking the more distant neighborhoods is weak and thus transit through much of the city is difficult. The quality of roads has improved somewhat, developed in part with loans from China, since 2000.

The public bus company for Kinshasa, created in 2003, is Transco (Transport au Congo).

Several companies operate registered taxis and taxi-buses, identifiable by their yellow color. 
In addition, an Uber-style, mobile phone, app-based, taxi hailing service was introduced in 2023.

===Air===
The city has two airports: N&#x27;djili Airport (FIH) is the main airport with connections to other African countries as well as to Istanbul, Brussels, Paris and some other destinations. N&#x27;Dolo Airport, located close to downtown, is used for domestic flights only with small turboprop aircraft. Several international airlines serve Ndjili Airport including Kenya Airways, South African Airways, Ethiopian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Air France and Turkish Airlines. An average of ten international flights depart each day from N&#x27;djili Airport. A small number of airlines provide domestic service from Kinshasa, for example Congo Airways and CAA. Both offer scheduled flights from Kinshasa to a limited number of cities inside DR Congo.

===Rail===


The Matadi–Kinshasa Railway connects Kinshasa with Matadi, Congo&#x27;s Atlantic port. The line reopened in September 2015 after around a decade without regular service. There is an intermittent service, with a poor safety record.

According to the Société Commerciale des Transports et des Ports (SCTP), the Matadi-Kinshasa Railway (CFMK) has the highest transport of goods in import, 8 746 tonnes in January, 11,318 tonnes in February 10,032 tonnes in March, 7,244 tonnes in April, 5,024 tonnes in March and 7,745 tonnes in June. The monthly tonnage of exported goods reached only 1,000 tonnes in the month of March 2018. In January some 284 tonnes of goods were exported from the ports of Boma and Matadi, via the railway, and 711 tonnes in February, then 1,058 tonnes in March, 684 tonnes in April, 818 tonnes in May and 853 tonnes in June.

The monthly statistics for passenger traffic are as follows: 2,294 persons in January, 1,836 in February, 2065 in March, 2,660 in April, 1,952 in May and 2,660 in June.

The line connecting the port of Matadi to Kinshasa is 366 km long. Its distance has been since 3111 of 3112 feet or 42 inches (lane capped 1,067 meter): This railway belongs, in fact, to the National Railway Company of the Congo (&quot;Société nationale des chemins de fer du Congo&quot;; SNCC). It is only exploited by the SCTP, formerly ONATRA, according to an agreement signed by the two companies.

This line lost large shares of the market, following its lamentable state, insecurity on the rails (some trains are attacked), and the rehabilitation of the road along the rails in 2000. According to Congolese sources, an agreement with a Chinese construction company was signed in 2006, according to which this Chinese company will finance the renovation of the track, the rolling stock, the communication channels for the signaling, and the electrical power source. The ex-ONATRA has, in fact, opted for an aggressive commercial policy to revive the rails.

On June 30, 2018, the SCTP received two locomotives and 50 wagons from the African firm ARSS (African-Rolling Stock Solution).

In 2017, some 2.2 million tonnes of cement were produced by the two new start-up companies, PPC Barnet and Kongo Cement Factory (CIMKO). The SCTP did indeed transport part of this production to Kinshasa but the exact quantity was not communicated by the railway department of the company, the former DG Kimbembe Mazunga had communicated an agreed protocol of agreements with the cement manufacturers of Kongo-Central for the transport of their productions.

===External transport===
Kinshasa is the major river port of the Congo. The port, called &#x27;Le Beach Ngobila&#x27; extends for about along the river, comprising scores of quays and jetties with hundreds of boats and barges tied up. Ferries cross the river to Brazzaville, a distance of about . River transport also connects to dozens of ports upstream, such as Kisangani and Bangui.

There are road and rail links to Matadi, the sea port in the Congo estuary from the Atlantic Ocean.

There are no rail links from Kinshasa further inland, and road connections to much of the rest of the country are few and in poor condition, although there has been a road built to the city of Kikwit (around 500 km away) that has been in operation since 2015 or so. It was recently extended to the small city of Tshikapa.

==Social issues==
===Crime and punishment===
Since the Second Congo War, the city has been striving to recover from disorder, with many youth gangs living and operating from Kinshasa&#x27;s poorer areas. The U.S. State Department in 2010 informed travelers that Kinshasa and other major Congolese cities are generally safe for daytime travel, but to beware of robbers, especially in traffic jams and in areas near hotels and stores.

Some sources say that Kinshasa is extremely dangerous, with one source giving a homicide rate of 112 per 100,000 people per year. Another source cites a homicide rate of 12.3 per 100,000. By some accounts, crime in Kinshasa is not so rampant, due to relatively good relations among residents and perhaps to the severity with which even petty crime is punished.

While the military and National Police operate their own jails in Kinshasa, the main detention facility under the jurisdiction of the local courts is the Kinshasa Penitentiary and Re-education center in Makala. This prison houses much more than its nominal capacity of 1,000 inmates. In 2024, the population of Makala Prison was reported at 15,000.
The Congolese military intelligence organization, Détection Militaire des Activités Anti-Patrie (DEMIAP) operates the Ouagadougou prison in Kintambo commune with notorious cruelty.

===Street children===
In the 2010s, street children or &quot;Shegués&quot;, often orphaned, are subject to abuse by the police and military. Of the estimated 20,000 children living on Kinshasa&#x27;s streets, almost a quarter are beggars, some are street vendors and about a third have some kind of employment. Some have fled from physically abusive families, notably step-parents, others were expelled from their families as they were believed to be witches, and have become outcasts. 

Street children are mainly boys, but the percentage of girls is increasing according to UNICEF. Ndako ya Biso provides support for street children, including overnight accommodation for girls. There are also second generation street children.

These children have been the object of considerable outside study.

==Notable people==
==International relations ==
Kinshasa is twinned with:

* Brazzaville, Republic of Congo
* Brussels, Belgium
* Johannesburg, South Africa

* Ankara, Turkey, since 2005

==In popular culture==
With its mix of culture, history, and lively atmosphere, Kinshasa has become a focus for filmmakers, musicians, writers, and artists.

=== Cinematic and TV representations ===

Kinshasa has been represented in various films, most notably in the film &quot;When We Were Kings&quot; (1996). This documentary chronicles the historic &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot; boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, held in Kinshasa in 1974. The film showcases the electrifying atmosphere of the city during the momentous event.

In &quot;Viva Riva!&quot; (2010), directed by Djo Tunda Wa Munga, the film offers a gritty portrayal of the city&#x27;s underworld, showing the tension between corruption, ambition, and survival.

Kinshasa&#x27;s social complexities are explored in &quot;Félicité&quot; (2017), directed by Alain Gomis. The film explores themes of pliability, community, and the power of music in the face of adversity. The film portrayed the essence of Kinshasa, depicting its vivacious music scene and the struggles faced by its inhabitants with sensitivity and authenticity.

In 2019, The Widow (TV series) was released on Amazon Prime and the UK&#x27;s ITV network. The mini-series tells the story of a woman searching for her husband in Kinshasa, after believing he&#x27;d been killed in a plane crash.

=== Literary depictions ===
Throughout history, authors have depicted the essence of Kinshasa in their writing, delving into its diverse cultural fabric, storied past, and the personal narratives of its residents. Fiston Mwanza Mujila&#x27;s &quot;Tram 83&quot; depicts the city&#x27;s nightlife while exploring themes of postcolonial identity and the struggle for social and economic progress. Meanwhile, In Koli Jean Bofane&#x27;s novel &quot;Congo Inc.: Bismarck&#x27;s Testament&quot; the city serves as a microcosm of post-colonial Congo, exploring themes of globalization, political corruption, and environmental degradation.

=== Music and dance ===

The music scene of Kinshasa has also made a significant impact on popular culture. Congolese rumba, a genre born in the city during the 1930s, continues to resonate globally. Artists like Franco Luambo Makiadi, Syran Mbenza, Le Grand Kallé, Nico Kasanda, Tabu Ley Rochereau, M&#x27;bilia Bel, Madilu System, Papa Noël Nedule, Vicky Longomba, Awilo Longomba, Pépé Kallé, Kanda Bongo Man, Nyboma Mwan&#x27;dido, General Defao, Papa Wemba, Koffi Olomide, Werrason, Abeti Masikini, Lokua Kanza, Fally Ipupa, and Ferré Gola have played a key role in popularizing Congolese music on the international stage, infusing their compositions with Kinshasa&#x27;s pulsating rhythms and infectious energy. The infectious beats of Congolese music have influenced artists across continents, shaping genres like soukous and influencing international musicians such as Paul Simon and Vampire Weekend.

=== Visual arts and fashion ===
Kinshasa&#x27;s street art scene has gained recognition globally, with talented artists using their creations to express social and political messages. Murals and graffiti, adorned with colorful imagery, can be found throughout the city.

==== La Sape ====
The La Sape subculture, characterized by extravagant and dapper fashion choices, has become an emblem of style, self-expression, and identity for the &quot;sapeurs&quot; of Kinshasa. It has gained international recognition through the lens of well-known photographers such as Daniele Tamagni. Tamagni&#x27;s book &quot;Gentlemen of Bacongo&quot; (2009) showcases the impeccable style and distinct personalities of Kinshasa&#x27;s &quot;sapeurs&quot;, accentuating their taste in tailored suits, bold hues, and eye-catching accessories. The city serves as the epicenter of La Sape, with various neighborhoods, communes and districts hosting events like &quot;le concours&quot; or &quot;la fête&quot; where sapeurs can display their style. La Sape has also inspired popular music and cultural expressions in Kinshasa, with sapeurs often featured in Congolese music videos as symbols of refinement and sophistication. Musicians such as Papa Wemba have embraced La Sape as an essential part of their artistic identity.

=== Martial arts ===
WWE wrestler Shinsuke Nakamura uses a running knee strike, called the &quot;Kinshasa&quot;, as his finisher, a reference to the eponymous city. The move was previously named as &quot;Bomaye&quot; (which translated to &quot;kill him&quot;) during his time in New Japan Pro Wrestling but was renamed in 2016 when he was signed with the WWE for trademark reasons. Both &quot;Bomaye&quot; and &quot;Kinshasa&quot; are homages to Nakamura&#x27;s mentor, Antonio Inoki, who received &quot;Bomaye&quot; as a nickname from Muhammad Ali when Inoki and Ali fought in 1976, with Ali first hearing &quot;Bomaye&quot; in Kinshasa during the Rumble In The Jungle.

<text>Colonization (British English: colonisation) is a process of establishing occupation of or control over foreign territories or peoples for the purpose of cultivation, exploitation, trade and possibly settlement, setting up coloniality and often colonies, commonly pursued and maintained by, but distinct from, imperialism, mercantilism, or colonialism. Colonization is sometimes used synonymously with settling, as with colonisation in biology.

Settler colonialism is a type of colonization structured and enforced by the settlers directly, while their or their ancestors&#x27; metropolitan country (&quot;metropole&quot;) maintains a connection or control through the settler&#x27;s colonialism. In settler colonization, a minority group rules either through the assimilation or oppression of the indigenous peoples, or by establishing itself as the demographic majority through driving away, displacing or outright killing the indigenous people, as well as through immigration and births of metropolitan as well as other settlers.

The European colonization of Australia, New Zealand, and other places in Oceania was fueled by explorers, and colonists often regarding the encountered landmasses as &quot;terra nullius&quot; (&quot;empty land&quot; in Latin). This resulted in laws and ideas such as Mexico&#x27;s General Colonization Law and the United States&#x27; manifest destiny doctrine which furthered colonization.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;colonization&quot; is derived from the Latin words (&quot;to cultivate, to till&quot;), (&quot;a landed estate&quot;, &quot;a farm&quot;) and (&quot;a tiller of the soil&quot;, &quot;a farmer&quot;), then by extension &quot;to inhabit&quot;. Someone who engages in colonization, i.e. the agent noun, is referred to as a &quot;colonizer&quot;, while the person who gets colonized, i.e. the object of the agent noun or absolutive, is referred to as a &quot;colonizee&quot;, &quot;colonisee&quot; or the &quot;colonised&quot;.

== Pre-modern colonizations ==

=== Classical period ===
In ancient times, maritime nations such as the city-states of Greece and Phoenicia established colonies in other parts of the Mediterranean.

Another period of colonization in ancient times was during the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire conquered large parts of Western Europe, North Africa, and West Asia. In North Africa and West Asia, the Romans often conquered what they regarded as &#x27;civilized&#x27; peoples. As they moved north into Europe, they mostly encountered rural peoples/tribes with very little in the way of cities. In these areas, waves of Roman colonization often followed the conquest of the areas. Many of the current cities throughout Europe began as Roman colonies, such as Cologne, Germany, originally called &quot;Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium&quot; by the Romans, and the British capital city of London, which the Romans founded as &quot;Londinium&quot;.

=== Middle Ages ===
The decline and collapse of the Roman Empire saw (and was partly caused by) the large-scale movement of people in Eastern Europe and Asia. This is largely seen as beginning with nomadic horsemen from Asia (specifically the Huns) moving into the richer pasture land to the west, thus forcing the local people there to move further west and so on until eventually the Goths were forced to cross into the Roman Empire, resulting in continuous war with Rome which played a major role in the fall of the Roman Empire. During this period there were large-scale movements of people establishing new colonies all over western Europe. The events of this time saw the development of many of the modern-day nations of Europe like the Franks in France and Germany and the Anglo-Saxons in England.

In West Asia, during Sassanid Empire, some Persians established colonies in Yemen and Oman. The Arabs also established colonies in Northern Africa, Mesopotamia, and the Levant.

The Vikings of Scandinavia also carried out a large-scale colonization. The Vikings are best known as raiders, setting out from their original homelands in Denmark, southern Norway, and southern Sweden, to pillage the coastlines of northern Europe. In time, the Vikings began trading and established colonies. The Vikings first came across Iceland and established colonies there before moving onto Greenland, where they built settlements that endured until the 15th century. The Vikings launched an unsuccessful attempt at colonizing an area they called Vinland, which is probably at a site now known as L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland and Labrador, on the eastern coastline of Canada.

== Modern colonialism ==

In the Colonial Era, colonialism in this context refers mostly to Western European countries&#x27; colonization of lands mainly in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania. The main European countries active in this form of colonization included Spain, Portugal, France, the Tsardom of Russia (later Russian Empire), the Kingdom of England (later Great Britain), the Netherlands, the Kingdom of Italy, the Kingdom of Prussia (now mostly Germany), Belgium, Denmark, and Sweden-Norway, and, beginning in the 18th century, the United States. Most of these countries had a period of almost complete power in world trade at some stage in the period from roughly 1500 to 1900. Beginning in the late 19th century, Imperial Japan also engaged in settler colonization, most notably in Hokkaido and Korea.

While some European colonization focused on shorter-term exploitation of economic opportunities (Newfoundland, for example, or Siberia) or addressed specific goals such as settlers seeking religious freedom (Massachusetts), at other times long-term social and economic planning was involved for both parties, but more on the colonizing countries themselves, based on elaborate theory-building (note James Oglethorpe&#x27;s Colony of Georgia in the 1730s and Edward Gibbon Wakefield&#x27;s New Zealand Company in the 1840s).
Colonization may be used as a method of absorbing and assimilating foreign people into the culture of the imperial country. One instrument to this end is linguistic imperialism, or the use of non-indigenous colonial languages to the exclusion of any indigenous languages from administrative (and often, any public) use.

== 20th–21st century ==
===Soviet Union===

In the 1920s, the Soviet regime implemented the so-called korenization policy in an attempt to win the trust of non-Russians by promoting their ethnic cultures and establishing for them many of the characteristic institutional forms of the nation-state. The early Soviet regime was hostile to even voluntary assimilation, and tried to de-Russify assimilated non-Russians. Parents and students not interested in the promotion of their national languages were labeled as displaying &quot;abnormal attitudes&quot;. The authorities concluded that minorities unaware of their ethnicities had to be subjected to Belarusization, Polonization, etc.

By the early 1930s, the Soviet regime introduced limited Russification; allowing voluntary assimilation, which was often a popular demand. The list of nationalities was reduced from 172 in 1927 to 98 in 1939, by revoking support for small nations in order to merge them into bigger ones. For example, Abkhazia was merged into Georgia and thousands of ethnic Georgians were sent to Abkhazia. The Abkhaz alphabet was changed to a Georgian base, Abkhazian schools were closed and replaced with Georgian schools, the Abkhaz language was banned. The ruling elite was purged of ethnic Abkhaz and by 1952 over 80% of the 228 top party and government officials and enterprise managers in Abkhazia were ethnic Georgians (there remained 34 Abkhaz, 7 Russians and 3 Armenians in these positions). For Königsberg area of East Prussia (modern Kaliningrad Oblast) given to the Soviet Union at the 1945 Potsdam Conference Soviet control meant a forcible expulsion of the remaining German population and mostly involuntary resettlement of the area with Soviet civilians.

Russians were now presented as the most advanced and least chauvinist people of the Soviet Union.

==== Baltic states ====
Large numbers of ethnic Russians and other Russian speakers were settled in the three Baltic countries – Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia – after their reoccupation in 1944, while local languages, religion and customs were suppressed. David Chioni Moore classified it as a &quot;reverse-cultural colonization&quot;, where the colonized perceived the colonizers as culturally inferior. Colonization of the three Baltic countries was closely tied to mass executions, deportations and repression of the native population. During both Soviet occupations (1940–1941; 1944–1991) a combined 605,000 inhabitants of the three countries were either killed or deported (135,000 Estonians, 170,000 Latvians and 320,000 Lithuanians), while their properties and personal belongings, along with ones who fled the country, were confiscated and given to the arriving colonists – Soviet military and NKVD personnel, as well as functionaries of the Communist Party and economic migrants from kolkhozes.

The most dramatic case was Latvia, where the amount of ethnic Russians swelled from 168,300 (8.8%) in 1935 to 905,500 (34%) in 1989, whereas the proportion of ethnic Latvians fell from 77% in 1935 to 52% in 1989. Baltic states also faced intense economic exploitation, with Latvian SSR, for example, transferring 15.961 billion rubles (or 18.8% percent of its total revenue of 85 billion rubles) more to the USSR budget from 1946 to 1990 than it received back. And of the money transferred back, a disproportionate amount was spent on the region&#x27;s militarization and funding of repressive institutions, especially in the early years of the occupation. It has been calculated by a Latvian state-funded commission that the Soviet occupation cost the economy of Latvia a total of 185 billion euros.

Conversely, Marxian economist and world-systems analyst Samir Amin asserts that, in contrast to colonialism, capital transfer in the USSR was used to develop poorer regions in the South and East with the wealthiest regions like Western Russia, Ukraine, and the Baltic Republics being the main source of capital. Estonian researcher Epp Annus acknowledges that the Soviet rule in the Baltic states did not possess every single characteristic of traditional colonialism since the Baltic states were already modern industrial European nation states with an established sense of national identity and cultural self-confidence prior to their Soviet invasion in 1940 and proposed that the initial Soviet occupation developed into a colonial rule gradually, as the local resistance turned into a hybrid coexistence with the Soviet power. The Soviet colonial rule never managed to fully establish itself and began rapidly disintegrating during &quot;perestroika&quot;, but after the restoration of independence, the Baltic states similarly had to deal with problems of a characteristically colonial nature, such as pollution, economic collapse and demographic tensions.

====Jewish oblast====

In 1934, the Soviet government established the Jewish Autonomous Oblast in the Soviet Far East to create a homeland for the Jewish people. Another motive was to strengthen Soviet presence along the vulnerable eastern border. The region was often infiltrated by the Chinese; in 1927, Chiang Kai-shek had ended cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party, which further increased the threat. Japan also seemed willing and ready to detach the Far Eastern provinces from the USSR. To make settlement of the inhospitable and undeveloped region more enticing, the Soviet government allowed private ownership of land. This led to many non-Jews to settle in the oblast to get a free farm.

By the 1930s, a massive propaganda campaign developed to induce more Jewish settlers to move there. In one instance, a government-produced Yiddish film called &quot;Seekers of Happiness&quot; told the story of a Jewish family that fled the Great Depression in the United States to make a new life for itself in Birobidzhan. Some 1,200 non-Soviet Jews chose to settle in Birobidzhan. The Jewish population peaked in 1948 at around 30,000, about one-quarter of the region&#x27;s population. By 2010, according to data provided by the Russian Census Bureau, there were only 1,628 people of Jewish descent remaining in the JAO (1% of the total population), while ethnic Russians made up 92.7% of the JAO population. The JAO is Russia&#x27;s only autonomous oblast and, aside of Israel, the world&#x27;s only Jewish territory with an official status.

===Israel===

In the First Aliyah, much of the Zionist settlement consisted of legal land purchases for agricultural colonies, or moshavot, for wine and citrus production.

According to Elia Zuriek in his book &quot;Israel&#x27;s Colonial Project in Palestine: Brutal Pursuit&quot;, Israeli settlements in the West Bank is an additional form of colonization. This view is part of a key debate in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Law professors Steven Lubet and Jonathan Zasloff describe the &quot;Zionism as settler colonialism&quot; theory as politically motivated, derogatory and highly controversial. According to them, there are important differences between Zionism and settler colonialism, for instance: (1) Early Zionists did not seek to transport European culture into Israel, they sought to revive the culture of an indigenous people of the land, the culture of their ancestors (e.g., they left their European languages behind and adopted a Middle Eastern/Semitic one: Hebrew); (2) No settler colonial movement ever claimed to be &quot;returning home&quot;; (3) Jews had already been living in the &quot;colonized&quot; region for thousands of years. Both professors also point out that the academic journal where Wolfe published his essay fails to mention the Islamic military campaign that captured the region in the 7th and 8th centuries.

===Indonesia===
The transmigration program is an initiative of the Indonesian government to move landless people from densely populated areas of Java, but also to a lesser extent from Bali and Madura, to less populous areas of the country including Papua, Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.

=== Papua New Guinea ===
In 1884 Britain declared a protective order over South East New Guinea, establishing an official colony in 1888. Germany however, annexed parts of the North. This annexation separated the entire region into the South, known as &quot;The Territory of Papua&quot; and North, known as &quot;German New Guinea&quot;.

=== Philippines ===

Due to marginalisation produced by continuous Resettlement Policy, by 1969, political tensions and open hostilities developed between the Government of the Philippines and Moro Muslim rebel groups in Mindanao.

=== Myanmar ===
===Subject peoples===
Many colonists came to colonies for slaves to their colonizing countries, so the legal power to leave or remain may not be the issue so much as the actual presence of the people in the new country. This left the indigenous natives of their lands slaves in their own countries.

The Canadian Indian residential school system was identified by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada) as colonization through depriving the youth of First Nations in Canada of their languages and cultures.

During the mid 20th century, there was the most dramatic and devastating attempt at colonization, and that was pursued with Nazism. Hitler and Heinrich Himmler and their supporters schemed for a mass migration of Germans to Eastern Europe, where some of the Germans were to become colonists, having control over the native people. These indigenous people were planned to be reduced to slaves or wholly annihilated.

Many advanced nations currently have large numbers of guest workers/temporary work visa holders who are brought in to do seasonal work such as harvesting or to do low-paid manual labor. Guest workers or contractors have a lower status than workers with visas, because guest workers can be removed at any time for any reason.

===Endo-colonization===
Colonization may be a domestic strategy when there is a widespread security threat within a nation and weapons are turned inward, as noted by Paul Virilio:
:Obsession with security results in the &quot;endo-colonization&quot; of society: endo-colonization is the use of increasingly powerful and ubiquitous technologies of security turned &quot;inward&quot;, to attempt to secure the fast and messy circulations of our globalizing, networked society...it is the increasing domination of public life with stories of dangerous otherness and suspicion...
Some instances of the burden of endo-colonization have been noted:
:The acute difficulties of the Latin American and southern European military-bureaucratic dictatorships in the seventies and early eighties and the Soviet Union in the late eighties can in large part be attributed to the economic, political and social contradictions induced by endo-colonizing militarism.

<text>The Representation of the People Act 1832 (also known as the Reform Act 1832, Great Reform Act or First Reform Act) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (indexed as 2 &amp; 3 Will. 4. c. 45), enacted by the Whig government of Prime Minister Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, introducing major changes to the electoral system of England and Wales, expanding the electorate in the United Kingdom. The legislation granted the right to vote to a broader segment of the male population by standardizing property qualifications, extending the franchise to small landowners, tenant farmers, shopkeepers, and all householders who paid a yearly rental of £10 or more. The Act also reapportioned constituencies to address the unequal distribution of seats. The Reform Act 1832 of England and Wales was accompanied by the Scottish Reform Act 1832 and Irish Reform Act 1832, respectively.

Before the reform, most members of Parliament nominally represented boroughs, and the number of electors in a borough varied widely however, from a dozen or so up to 12,000, and the criteria for qualification for the franchise varied greatly among these boroughs, from the requirement to own land, to merely living in a house with a hearth sufficient to boil a pot.

The full title of the Reform Act 1832 is: &quot;An Act to amend the representation of the people in England and Wales&quot;. It&#x27;s formal short title and citation is Representation of the People Act 1832 (2 &amp; 3 Will. 4. c. 45). The Irish Reform Act 1832 brought similar changes to Ireland, and the separate Scottish Reform Act 1832 was revolutionary, enlarging the electorate by a factor of 13 from 5,000 to 65,000.

==Unreformed House of Commons==
After the Acts of Union 1800 became law on 1 January 1801, the unreformed House of Commons comprised 658 members, of whom 513 represented England and Wales. There were two types of constituency: counties and boroughs. County members were supposed to represent landholders, while borough members were supposed to represent mercantile and trading interests.

=== Counties ===

Counties were historical national subdivisions established between the 8th and 16th centuries. They were not merely parliamentary constituencies: many components of government (as well as courts and the militia) were organised along county lines. The members of Parliament chosen by the counties were known as knights of the shire. In Wales, each county elected one member, while in England, each county elected two members until 1826 when Yorkshire&#x27;s representation was increased to four, following the disenfranchisement of the Cornish borough of Grampound.

=== Boroughs ===

Parliamentary boroughs in England ranged in size from small hamlets to large cities, partly because they had evolved haphazardly. The earliest boroughs were chosen in the Middle Ages by county sheriffs, and even a village might be deemed a borough. Many of these early boroughs (such as Winchelsea and Dunwich) were substantial settlements at the time of their original enfranchisement, but later went into decline, and by the early 19th century some only had a few electors, but still elected two MPs; they were often known as rotten boroughs. Of the 70 English boroughs that Tudor monarchs enfranchised, 31 were later disenfranchised. Finally, the parliamentarians of the 17th century compounded the inconsistencies by re-enfranchising 15 boroughs whose representation had lapsed for centuries, seven of which were later disenfranchised by the Reform Act 1832. After Newark was enfranchised in 1661, no additional boroughs were enfranchised, and, with the sole exception of Grampound&#x27;s 1821 disenfranchisement, the system remained unchanged until the Reform Act 1832. Most English boroughs elected two MPs; but five boroughs elected only one MP: Abingdon, Banbury, Bewdley, Higham Ferrers and Monmouth. The City of London and the joint borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis each elected four members. The Welsh boroughs each returned a single member.

===The franchise===
Statutes passed in 1430 and 1432, during the reign of Henry VI, standardised property qualifications for county voters. Under these Acts, all owners of freehold property or land with an annual value of at least forty shillings in a particular county were entitled to vote in that county. This requirement, known as the forty shilling freehold, was never adjusted for inflation of land value; thus the amount of land one had to own in order to vote gradually diminished over time. The franchise was restricted to men by custom rather than statute; on rare occasions women had been able to vote in parliamentary elections as a result of property ownership. Nevertheless, the vast majority of people were not entitled to vote; the size of the English county electorate in 1831 has been estimated at only 200,000 and 400,000 enfranchised Englishmen overall. Furthermore, the sizes of the individual county constituencies varied significantly. The smallest counties, Rutland and Anglesey, had fewer than 1,000 voters each, while the largest county, Yorkshire, had more than 20,000. Those who owned property in multiple constituencies could vote multiple times. Not only was this typically legal (since there was usually no need for a property owner to live in a constituency in order to vote there) it was also feasible, even with the technology of the time, since polling was usually held over several days.

In boroughs the franchise was far more varied. There were broadly six types of parliamentary boroughs, as defined by their franchise:
# Boroughs in which freemen were electors;
# Boroughs in which the franchise was restricted to those paying scot and lot, a form of municipal taxation;
# Boroughs in which only the ownership of a burgage property qualified a person to vote;
# Boroughs in which only members of the corporation were electors (such boroughs were perhaps in every case &quot;pocket boroughs&quot;, because council members were usually &quot;in the pocket&quot; of a wealthy patron);
# Boroughs in which male householders were electors (these were usually known as &quot;potwalloper boroughs&quot;, as the usual definition of a householder was a person able to boil a pot on his/her own hearth);
# Boroughs in which freeholders of land had the right to vote.

Some boroughs had a combination of these varying types of franchise, and most had special rules and exceptions, so many boroughs had a form of franchise that was unique to themselves.

The largest borough, Westminster, had about 12,000 voters, while many of the smallest, usually known as &quot;rotten boroughs&quot;, had fewer than 100 each. The most famous rotten borough was Old Sarum, which had 13 burgage plots that could be used to &quot;manufacture&quot; electors if necessary—usually around half a dozen was thought sufficient. Other examples were Dunwich (32 voters), Camelford (25), and Gatton (7).

===Pocket boroughs===

Many constituencies, especially those with small electorates, were under the control of rich landowners, and were known as nomination boroughs or pocket boroughs, because they were said to be in the pockets of their patrons. Most patrons were noblemen or landed gentry who could use their local influence, prestige, and wealth to sway the voters. This was particularly true in rural counties, and in small boroughs situated near a large landed estate. Some noblemen even controlled multiple constituencies: for example, the Duke of Norfolk controlled eleven, while the Earl of Lonsdale controlled nine. Writing in 1821, Sydney Smith proclaimed that &quot;The country belongs to the Duke of Rutland, Lord Lonsdale, the Duke of Newcastle, and about twenty other holders of boroughs. They are our masters!&quot; T. H. B. Oldfield claimed in his &quot;Representative History of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; that, out of the 514 members representing England and Wales, about 370 were selected by nearly 180 patrons. A member who represented a pocket borough was expected to vote as his patron ordered, or else lose his seat at the next election. Voters in some constituencies resisted outright domination by powerful landlords, but were often open to corruption.

==Movement for reform==

===Early attempts at reform===
===After the French Revolution===
Support for parliamentary reform plummeted after the French Revolution in 1789. Many English politicians became steadfastly opposed to any major political change. Despite this reaction, several Radical Movement groups were established to agitate for reform. A group of Whigs led by James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale, and Charles Grey founded an organisation advocating parliamentary reform in 1792. This group, known as the Society of the Friends of the People, included 28 MPs. In 1793, Grey presented to the House of Commons a petition from the Friends of the People, outlining abuses of the system and demanding change. He did not propose any specific scheme of reform, but merely a motion that the House inquire into possible improvements. Parliament&#x27;s reaction to the French Revolution was so negative, that even this request for an inquiry was rejected by a margin of almost 200 votes. Grey tried to raise the subject again in 1797, but the House again rebuffed him by a majority of over 150.

Other notable pro-reform organisations included the Hampden Clubs (named after John Hampden, an English politician who opposed the Crown during the English Civil War) and the London Corresponding Society (which consisted of workers and artisans). But the &quot;Radical&quot; reforms supported by these organisations (for example, universal suffrage) found even less support in Parliament. For example, when Sir Francis Burdett, chairman of the London Hampden Club, proposed a resolution in favour of universal suffrage, equally sized electoral districts, and voting by secret ballot to the House of Commons, his motion found only one other supporter (Lord Cochrane) in the entire House.

Despite such setbacks, popular pressure for reform remained strong. In 1819, a large pro-reform rally was held in Birmingham. Although the city was not entitled to any seats in the Commons, those gathered decided to elect Sir Charles Wolseley as Birmingham&#x27;s &quot;legislatorial representative&quot;. Following their example, reformers in Manchester held a similar meeting to elect a &quot;legislatorial attorney&quot;. Between 20,000 and 60,000 (by different estimates) attended the event. The protesters were ordered to disband; when they did not, the Manchester Yeomanry suppressed the meeting by force. Eighteen people were killed and several hundred injured in what later became known as the Peterloo Massacre. In response, the government passed the Six Acts, measures designed to quell further political agitation. In particular, the Seditious Meetings Act prohibited groups of more than 50 people from assembling to discuss any political subject without prior permission from the sheriff or magistrate.

===Reform during the 1820s===
Since the House of Commons regularly rejected direct challenges to the system of representation by large majorities, supporters of reform had to content themselves with more modest measures. The Whig Lord John Russell brought forward one such measure in 1820, proposing the disfranchisement of the notoriously corrupt borough of Grampound in Cornwall. He suggested that the borough&#x27;s two seats be transferred to the city of Leeds. Tories in the House of Lords agreed to the disfranchisement of the borough, but refused to accept the precedent of directly transferring its seats to an industrial city. Instead, they modified the proposal so that two further seats were given to Yorkshire, the county in which Leeds is situated. In this form, the bill passed both houses and became law. In 1828, Lord John Russell suggested that Parliament repeat the idea by abolishing the corrupt boroughs of Penryn and East Retford, and by transferring their seats to Manchester and Birmingham. This time, however, the House of Lords rejected his proposals. In 1830, Russell proposed another, similar scheme: the enfranchisement of Leeds, Manchester, and Birmingham, and the disfranchisement of the next three boroughs found guilty of corruption; again, the proposal was rejected.

Support for reform came from an unexpected source—a reactionary faction of the Tory Party—in 1829. The Tory government under Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, responding to the danger of civil strife in largely Roman Catholic Ireland, drew up the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829. This legislation repealed various laws that imposed political disabilities on Roman Catholics, in particular laws that prevented them from becoming members of Parliament. In response, disenchanted ultra-Tories who perceived a danger to the established religion came to favour parliamentary reform, in particular the enfranchisement of Manchester, Leeds, and other heavily Nonconformist cities in northern England.

==Passage of the Reform Act==

===First Reform Bill===
The death of King George IV on 26 June 1830 dissolved Parliament by law, and a general election was held. Electoral reform, which had been frequently discussed during the preceding parliamentary session, became a major campaign issue. Across the country, several pro-reform &quot;political unions&quot; were formed, made up of both middle and working class individuals. The most influential of these was the Birmingham Political Union, led by Thomas Attwood. These groups confined themselves to lawful means of supporting reform, such as petitioning and public oratory, and achieved a high level of public support.

Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey became prime minister in 1830, and his first announcement as prime minister was a pledge to carry out parliamentary reform. On 1 March 1831, Lord John Russell brought forward the Reform Bill in the House of Commons on the government&#x27;s behalf. The bill disfranchised 60 of the smallest boroughs, and reduced the representation of 47 others. Some seats were completely abolished, while others were redistributed to the London suburbs, to large cities, to the counties, and to Scotland and Ireland. Furthermore, the bill standardised and expanded the borough franchise, increasing the size of the electorate (according to one estimate) by half a million voters.

On 22 March, the vote on the second reading attracted a record 608 members, including the non-voting Speaker (the previous record was 530 members). Despite the high attendance, the second reading was approved by only one vote, and further progress on the Reform Bill was difficult. During the committee stage, Isaac Gascoyne put forward a motion objecting to provisions of the bill that reduced the total number of seats in the House of Commons. This motion was carried, against the government&#x27;s wishes, by 8 votes. The ministry lost a vote on a procedural motion by 22 votes. As these divisions indicated that Parliament was against the Reform Bill, the ministry decided to request a dissolution and take its appeal to the people.

===Second Reform Bill===
The political and popular pressure for reform had grown so great that pro-reform Whigs won an overwhelming House of Commons majority in the general election of 1831. The Whig party won almost all constituencies with genuine electorates, leaving the Tories with little more than the rotten boroughs. The Reform Bill was again brought before the House of Commons, which agreed to the second reading by a large majority in July. During the committee stage, opponents of the bill slowed its progress through tedious discussions of its details, but it was finally passed in September 1831, by a margin of more than 100 votes.

The Bill was then sent up to the House of Lords, a majority in which was known to be hostile to it. After the Whigs&#x27; decisive victory in the 1831 election, some speculated that opponents would abstain, rather than openly defy the public will. Indeed, when the Lords voted on the second reading of the bill after a memorable series of debates, many Tory peers did refrain from voting. However, the Lords Spiritual mustered in unusually large numbers, and of 22 present, 21 voted against the Bill. It failed by 41 votes.

When the Lords rejected the Reform Bill, public violence ensued. That very evening, riots broke out in Derby, where a mob attacked the city jail and freed several prisoners. In Nottingham, rioters set fire to Nottingham Castle (the home of the Duke of Newcastle) and attacked Wollaton Hall (the estate of Lord Middleton). The most significant disturbances occurred at Bristol, where rioters controlled the city for three days. The mob broke into prisons and destroyed several buildings, including the palace of the Bishop of Bristol, the mansion of the Lord Mayor of Bristol, and several private homes. Other places that saw violence included Dorset, Leicestershire, and Somerset.

Meanwhile, the political unions, which had hitherto been separate groups united only by a common goal, decided to form the National Political Union. Perceiving this group as a threat, the government issued a proclamation pursuant to the Corresponding Societies Act 1799 declaring such an association &quot;unconstitutional and illegal&quot;, and commanding all loyal subjects to shun it. The leaders of the National Political Union ignored this proclamation, but leaders of the influential Birmingham branch decided to co-operate with the government by discouraging activities on a national level.

===Third Reform Bill===
After the Reform Bill was rejected in the Lords, the House of Commons immediately passed a motion of confidence affirming their support for Lord Grey&#x27;s administration. Because parliamentary rules prohibited the introduction of the same bill twice during the same session, the ministry advised the new king, William IV, to prorogue Parliament. As soon as the new session began in December 1831, the Third Reform Bill was brought forward. The bill was in a few respects different from its predecessors; it no longer proposed a reduction in the total membership of the House of Commons, and it reflected data collected during the census that had just been completed. The new version passed in the House of Commons by even larger majorities in March 1832; it was once again sent up to the House of Lords.

Realizing that another rejection would not be politically feasible, opponents of reform decided to use amendments to change the bill&#x27;s essential character; for example, they voted to delay consideration of clauses in the bill that disfranchised the rotten boroughs. The ministers believed that they were left with only one alternative: to create a large number of new peerages, swamping the House of Lords with pro-reform votes. But the prerogative of creating peerages rested with the king, who recoiled from so drastic a step and rejected the unanimous advice of his cabinet. Lord Grey then resigned, and the king invited the Duke of Wellington to form a new government.

The ensuing period became known as the &quot;Days of May&quot;, with so great a level of political agitation that some feared revolution. Some protesters advocated non-payment of taxes, and urged a run on the banks; one day signs appeared across London reading &quot;Stop the Duke; go for gold!&quot; £1.8 million was withdrawn from the Bank of England in the first days of the run (out of about £7 million total gold in the bank&#x27;s possession). The National Political Union and other organisations sent petitions to the House of Commons, demanding that they withhold supply (cut off funding to the government) until the House of Lords should acquiesce. Some demonstrations called for the abolition of the nobility, and some even of the monarchy. In these circumstances, the Duke of Wellington had great difficulty in building support for his premiership, despite promising moderate reform. He was unable to form a government, leaving King William with no choice but to recall Lord Grey. Eventually the king consented to fill the House of Lords with Whigs; however, without the knowledge of his cabinet, Wellington circulated a letter among Tory peers, encouraging them to desist from further opposition, and warning them of the consequences of continuing. At this, enough opposing peers relented. By abstaining from further votes, they allowed the legislation to pass in the House of Lords, and the Crown was thus not forced to create new peers. The bill finally received royal assent on 7 June 1832, thereby becoming law.

==Results==

===Provisions===

====Abolition of seats====
The Reform Act&#x27;s chief objective was the reduction of the number of nomination boroughs. There were 203 boroughs in England before the Act. The 56 smallest of these, as measured by their housing stock and tax assessments, were completely abolished. The next 30 smallest boroughs each lost one of their two MPs. In addition Weymouth and Melcombe Regis&#x27;s four members were reduced to two. Thus in total the Act abolished 143 borough seats in England (one of the boroughs to be completely abolished, Higham Ferrers, returned only a single MP).

====Creation of new seats====
In their place the Act created 130 new seats in England and Wales:
* 26 English counties were divided into two divisions with each division being represented by two members.
* 8 English counties and 3 Welsh counties each received an additional representative.
* Yorkshire, which was represented by four MPs before the Act, was given an extra two MPs (so that each of its three ridings was represented by two MPs).
* 22 large towns were given two MPs.
* Another 21 towns (of which two were in Wales) were given one MP.

Thus 65 new county seats and 65 new borough seats were created in England and Wales. The total number of English members fell by 17 and the number in Wales increased by four. The boundaries of the new divisions and parliamentary boroughs were defined in a separate Act, the Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1832.

====Extension of the franchise====
In county constituencies, franchise rights were extended to copyholders and long-term (at least sixty years) leaseholders of land with at least £10 annual value, medium-term (between twenty and sixty years) leaseholders of land with at least £10 annual value, and to tenants-at-will paying an annual rent of at least £50. Annual value refers to the rent at which the land might reasonably be expected to be let from year to year. (The franchise rights of 40 shilling freeholders were retained.)

The property qualifications of borough franchise were standardised to male occupants of property who paid a yearly rental of £10 or more. The property could be a house, warehouse, counting-house, shop, or other building as long as it was occupied, and occupied for at least 12 months. Existing borough electors retained a lifetime right to vote, however they had qualified, provided they were resident in the boroughs in which they were electors. In those boroughs which had freemen electors, voting rights were to be enjoyed by future freemen as well, provided their freemanship was acquired through birth or apprenticeship and they too were resident.

The Act also introduced a system of voter registration, to be administered by the overseers of the poor in every parish and township. It instituted a system of special courts to review disputes relating to voter qualifications. It also authorised the use of multiple polling places within the same constituency, and limited the duration of polling to two days. (Formerly, polls could remain open for up to fifteen days.)

The Reform Act itself did not affect constituencies in Scotland or Ireland. However, there were also reforms there, under the Scottish Reform Act and the Irish Reform Act. Scotland received eight additional seats, and Ireland received five; thus keeping the total number of seats in the House of Commons the same as it had been before the Act. While no constituencies were disfranchised in either of those countries, voter qualifications were standardised and the size of the electorate was increased in both.

===Effects===
Between 1835 and 1841, local Conservative Associations began to educate citizens about the party&#x27;s platform and encouraged them to register to vote annually, as required by the Act. Coverage of national politics in the local press was joined by in-depth reports on provincial politics in the national press. Grassroots Conservatives therefore saw themselves as part of a national political movement during the 1830s.

The size of the pre-Reform electorate is difficult to estimate. Voter registration was lacking, and many boroughs were rarely contested in elections. It is estimated that immediately before the 1832 Reform Act, 400,000 English subjects (people who lived in the country) were entitled to vote, and that after passage, the number rose to 650,000, an increase of more than 60%. Rodney Mace estimates that before, 1 per cent of the population could vote and that the Reform Act only extended the franchise to 7 per cent of the population.

Tradesmen, such as shoemakers, believed that the Reform Act had given them the vote. One example is the shoemakers of Duns, Scottish Borders, Berwickshire. They created a banner celebrating the Reform Act which declared, &quot;The battle&#x27;s won. Britannia&#x27;s sons are free.&quot; This banner is on display at People&#x27;s History Museum in Manchester.

Many major commercial and industrial cities became separate parliamentary boroughs under the Act. The new constituencies saw party conflicts within the middle class, and between the middle class and working class. A study of elections in the medium-sized borough of Halifax, 1832–1852, concluded that the party organisations, and the voters themselves, depended heavily on local social relationships and local institutions. Having the vote encouraged many men to become much more active in the political, economic and social sphere.

The Scottish Act revolutionised politics in Scotland, with its population of 2 million. Its electorate had been only 0.2% of the population compared to 4% in England. The Scottish electorate overnight soared from 5,000 to 65,000, or 13% of the adult men, and was no longer a private preserve of a few very rich families.

==== Tenant voters ====
Most of the pocket boroughs abolished by the Reform Act belonged to the Tory party. These losses were somewhat offset by the extension of the vote to tenants-at-will paying an annual rent of £50. This clause, proposed by the Tory Marquess of Chandos, was adopted in the House of Commons despite opposition from the Government. The tenants-at-will thereby enfranchised typically voted as instructed by their landlords, who in turn normally supported the Tory party. This concession, together with the Whig party&#x27;s internal divisions and the difficulties faced by the nation&#x27;s economy, allowed the Tories under Sir Robert Peel to make gains in the elections of 1835 and 1837, and to retake the House of Commons in 1841.

A modern historian&#x27;s examination of votes in the House concluded that the traditional landed interest &quot;suffered very little&quot; by the 1832 Act. They continued to dominate the Commons, while losing some of their power to enact laws that focused on their more parochial interests. By contrast, the same study concluded that the 1867 Reform Act caused serious erosion of their legislative power and the 1874 elections saw great landowners losing their county seats to the votes of tenant farmers in England and especially in Ireland.

===Limitations===
The property qualifications of the Reform Act were substantial at the time and barred most of the working class from the vote. This created division between the working class and the middle class and led to the growth of the Chartist Movement.

Although it did disenfranchise most rotten boroughs, a few remained, such as Totnes in Devon and Midhurst in Sussex. Also, bribery of voters remained a problem. As Sir Thomas Erskine May observed, &quot;it was too soon evident, that as more votes had been created, more votes were to be sold&quot;.

The Reform Act strengthened the House of Commons by reducing the number of nomination boroughs controlled by peers. Some aristocrats complained that, in the future, the government could compel them to pass any bill, simply by threatening to swamp the House of Lords with new peerages. The Duke of Wellington lamented: &quot;If such projects can be carried into execution by a minister of the Crown with impunity, there is no doubt that the constitution of this House, and of this country, is at an end... [T]here is absolutely an end put to the power and objects of deliberation in this House, and an end to all just and proper means of decision.&quot; The subsequent history of Parliament, however, shows that the influence of the Lords was largely undiminished. They compelled the Commons to accept significant amendments to the Municipal Reform Bill in 1835, forced compromises on Jewish emancipation, and successfully resisted several other bills supported by the public. It would not be until decades later, culminating in the Parliament Act 1911, that Wellington&#x27;s fears would come to pass.

===Further reform===
During the ensuing years, Parliament adopted several more minor reforms. Acts of Parliament passed in 1835 and 1836 increased the number of polling places in each constituencies and thus reduced polling to a single day. Parliament also passed several laws aimed at combatting corruption, including the Corrupt Practices Act 1854, though these measures proved largely ineffectual. Neither party strove for further major reform; leading statesmen on both sides regarded the Reform Act as a final settlement.

There was considerable public agitation for further expansion of the electorate, however. In particular, the Chartist movement, which demanded universal suffrage for men, equally sized electoral districts, and voting by secret ballot, gained a widespread following. However, the Tories were united against further reform, and the Liberal Party (successor to the Whigs) did not seek a general revision of the electoral system until 1852. The 1850s saw Lord John Russell introduce a number of reform bills to correct defects the first act had left unaddressed. However, no proposal was successful until 1867, when Parliament adopted the Second Reform Act.

An area the Reform Act did not address was the issue of municipal and regional government. As a result of archaic traditions, many English counties had enclaves and exclaves, which were mostly abolished in the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844. Furthermore, many new conurbations and economic areas bridged traditional county boundaries by having been formed in previously obscure areas: the West Midlands conurbation bridged Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire, Manchester and Liverpool both had hinterlands in Cheshire but city centres in Lancashire, while in the south Oxford&#x27;s developing southern suburbs were in Berkshire and London was expanding into Essex, Surrey and Middlesex. This led to further acts to reorganise county boundaries in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

<doc id="45782" wikidata="Q71275" url="?curid=45782" title="Spencer Tracy">
<text>Spencer Bonaventure Tracy (April 5, 1900 – June 10, 1967) was an American actor. He was known for his natural performing style and versatility. One of the major stars of Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age, Tracy was the first actor to win two consecutive Academy Awards for Best Actor, from nine nominations. During his career, he appeared in 75 films and developed a reputation among his peers as one of the screen&#x27;s greatest actors. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Tracy as the 9th greatest male star of Classic Hollywood Cinema.

Tracy first discovered his talent for acting while attending Ripon College, and he later received a scholarship for the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He spent seven years in the theater, working in a succession of stock companies and intermittently on Broadway. His breakthrough came in 1930, when his lead performance in &quot;The Last Mile&quot; caught the attention of Hollywood. After a successful film debut in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Up the River&quot; (in which he starred with Humphrey Bogart), he was signed to a contract with Fox Film Corporation. Tracy&#x27;s five years with Fox featured one acting &quot;tour de force&quot; after another that were usually ignored at the box office, and he remained largely unknown to movie audiences after 25 films, nearly all of them starring him as the leading man. None of them were hits, although his performance in &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; (1933) was highly praised at the time.

In 1935, Tracy joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Hollywood&#x27;s most prestigious studio at the time. His career flourished after his fifth MGM film, &quot;Fury&quot; (1936), and in 1937 and 1938 he won consecutive Oscars for &quot;Captains Courageous&quot; and &quot;Boys Town&quot;. Tracy teamed with Clark Gable, MGM&#x27;s most prominent leading man, for three major box office successes, and by the early 1940s, he was one of MGM&#x27;s top stars. In 1942, he appeared with Katharine Hepburn in &quot;Woman of the Year&quot;, beginning a professional and personal partnership that led to nine films over 25 years. In 1955, Tracy won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film &quot;Bad Day at Black Rock&quot;.

Tracy left MGM in 1955 and continued to work regularly as a freelance star, despite several health issues and an increasing weariness and irritability as he aged. His personal life was troubled, with a lifelong struggle against severe alcoholism and guilt over his son&#x27;s deafness. Tracy and his wife Louise became estranged in the 1930s, but the couple never divorced. His 25-year relationship with Katharine Hepburn was an open secret. Towards the end of his life, Tracy worked almost exclusively for director Stanley Kramer. Tracy made his last film with Kramer, &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot; (1967), with filming completed just 17 days before he died.

==Early life and education ==
Spencer Bonaventure Tracy was born in Milwaukee on April 5, 1900, the second son of Caroline (&quot;née&quot; Brown; 1874–1942) and truck salesman John Edward Tracy (1873–1928). His mother was from a wealthy Presbyterian Midwestern family, while his father was of Irish Catholic descent. He had a brother Carroll, who was four years older.

Tracy was a difficult and hyperactive child  with poor school attendance. Raised Catholic, he was placed in the care of Dominican Order nuns at the age of nine in an attempt to transform his behavior. Later in life, he remarked that he &quot;never would have gone back to school if there had been any other way of learning to read the subtitles in the movies&quot;. He became fascinated with movies, watching the same ones repeatedly and later re-enacting scenes to his friends and neighbors. He attended several Jesuit academies in his teenage years, which he claimed took the &quot;badness&quot; out of him and helped him improve his grades.
At Marquette Academy, he began attending plays with lifelong friend and fellow actor Pat O&#x27;Brien, awakening his interest in the theater. With little care for their studies and &quot;itching for a chance to go and see some excitement&quot;, Tracy and O&#x27;Brien enlisted in the Navy together when Tracy turned 18. They were sent to the Naval Training Station in northern Illinois, where they were still recruits-in-training when World War I came to an end. Tracy achieved the rank of seaman second class, but never went to sea and was discharged in February 1919. His father&#x27;s desire to see one of his sons gain a college degree drove Tracy back to high school to finish his diploma. Studies at two more institutions, plus the additional allowance of &quot;war credits&quot;, won Tracy a place at Ripon College. He entered in February 1921, declaring his intention to major in medicine.

Tracy was a popular student at Ripon, where he served as president of his hall and was involved in a number of college activities. He made his stage debut in June 1921, playing the male lead in &quot;The Truth&quot;. He was very well received in the role and quickly developed a passion for the stage; he was reportedly &quot;obsessive about acting to the degree that he talked about little else&quot;. He and some friends formed an acting company called the Campus Players, which they took on tour. As a member of the college debate team, Tracy excelled in arguing and public speaking. It was during a tour with the debate team that he auditioned for the American Academy of Dramatic Arts (AADA) in New York City. He was offered a scholarship to attend the school after performing a scene from one of his earlier roles.

Tracy left Ripon and began classes at AADA in April 1922. O&#x27;Brien was also enrolled there and the two shared a small studio apartment. Money was scarce, and the two often lived on meals of rice and pretzels and shared one decent suit between them. Tracy was deemed fit to progress to the senior class, allowing him to join the academy&#x27;s stock company. He made his New York debut in a play called &quot;The Wedding Guests&quot;, which opened in October 1922. He made his debut Broadway appearance three months later, playing a wordless robot in &quot;R.U.R.&quot; He graduated from AADA in March 1923.

==Career==
===Stock theater and Broadway (1923–1930)===
Immediately following graduation, Tracy joined a new stock company based in White Plains, New York, where he was given peripheral roles. Unhappy there, he moved to a company in Cincinnati, but failed to make an impact. In November 1923, he landed a small part on Broadway in the comedy &quot;A Royal Fandango&quot;, starring Ethel Barrymore. Reviews for the show were poor and it closed after 25 performances; Tracy later said of the failure, &quot;My ego took an awful beating.&quot; When he took a position with a struggling company in New Jersey, Tracy was living on an allowance of 35 cents a day. In January 1924, he played his first leading role with a company in Winnipeg, but the organization soon closed.

Tracy finally achieved some success by joining forces with the notable stock manager William H. Wright in the spring of 1924. A stage partnership was formed with the young actress Selena Royle, who had already made her name on Broadway. It proved a popular draw and their productions were favorably received. One of these performances brought Tracy to the attention of a Broadway producer, who offered him the lead in a new play. &quot;The Sheepman&quot; previewed in October 1925, but it received poor reviews and closed after its trial run in Connecticut. Dejected, Tracy was forced back to Wright and the stock circuit.

In the fall of 1926, Tracy was offered his third shot at Broadway: a role in a new George M. Cohan play called &quot;Yellow&quot;. Tracy swore that if the play failed to be a hit he would leave stock and work in a &quot;regular&quot; business instead. Tracy was nervous about working with Cohan, one of the most important figures in American theater, but during rehearsals Cohan announced, &quot;Tracy, you&#x27;re the best goddamned actor I&#x27;ve ever seen!&quot; &quot;Yellow&quot; opened on September 21; reviews were mixed but it ran for 135 performances. It was the beginning of an important collaboration for Tracy: &quot;I&#x27;d have quit the stage completely,&quot; he later commented, &quot;if it hadn&#x27;t been for George M. Cohan.&quot; Cohan wrote a part specifically for Tracy in his next play, &quot;The Baby Cyclone&quot;. It opened on Broadway in September 1927 and was a hit.

Tracy followed this success with another Cohan play, &quot;Whispering Friends&quot;, and in 1929 took over from Clark Gable in &quot;Conflict&quot;, a Broadway drama. Other roles followed, but it was the lead in &quot;Dread&quot;, written by Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatist Owen Davis that gave Tracy high hopes for success. The story of a man&#x27;s descent into madness, &quot;Dread&quot; previewed in Brooklyn to an excellent reception, but on the next day—October 29—the New York stock market crashed. Unable to obtain funding, &quot;Dread&quot; did not open on Broadway. Following this disappointment, Tracy again considered leaving the theater and returning to Milwaukee for a more stable life.

In January 1930, Tracy was approached about a new play called &quot;The Last Mile&quot;. Looking to cast the lead role of a murderer on death row, producer Herman Shumlin met with Tracy, and later recounted: &quot;beneath the surface, here was a man of passion, violence, sensitivity and desperation: no ordinary man, and just the man for the part.&quot; &quot;The Last Mile&quot; opened on Broadway in February, where Tracy&#x27;s performance was met by a standing ovation that lasted 14 curtain calls. The &quot;Commonweal&quot; described him as &quot;one of our best and most versatile young actors&quot;. The play was a hit with critics, and ran for 289 performances.

===Fox (1930–1935)===
In 1930, Broadway was being scouted to find actors to work in the new medium of sound films. Tracy was cast in two Vitaphone shorts (&quot;Taxi Talks&quot; and &quot;The Hard Guy&quot;), but he had not considered becoming a film actor: &quot;I had no ambition in that direction and I was perfectly happy on the stage&quot;, he later explained in an interview. One person who saw Tracy in &quot;The Last Mile&quot; was director John Ford.

Ford wanted Tracy for the lead role in his next picture, a prison movie. Production company Fox Film Corporation was unsure about Tracy, saying that he did not photograph well, but Ford convinced them that he was right for the role. &quot;Up the River&quot; (1930) marked the film debut of both Tracy and Humphrey Bogart. After seeing the rushes, Fox immediately offered Tracy a long-term contract. Knowing that he needed the money for his family, with his young son deaf and recovering from polio, Tracy signed with Fox and moved to California. He appeared on the stage only once more in his life.

Winfield Sheehan, the head of Fox, committed to making Tracy a bankable commodity. The studio promoted the actor, releasing ads for his second film &quot;Quick Millions&quot; (1931) with the headline &quot;A New Star Shines&quot;. Three films were made in quick succession, all of which were unsuccessful at the box office. Tracy found himself typecast in comedies, usually playing a crook or a con man. The mold was broken with his seventh picture, &quot;Disorderly Conduct&quot; (1932), and it was the first of his films since &quot;Up the River&quot; to return a profit.

In mid-1932, after nine pictures, Tracy remained virtually unknown to the public. He considered leaving Fox once his contract was up for renewal, but a raise in his weekly salary to $1,500 convinced him to stay. He continued to appear in unpopular films, with &quot;Me and My Gal&quot; (1932) setting an all-time low attendance record for the Roxy Theatre in New York City. He was loaned to Warner Bros. for &quot;20,000 Years in Sing Sing&quot; (1932), a prison drama co-starring Bette Davis. Tracy was hopeful that it would be his break-out role, but despite good reviews, this failed to materialize.

Critics began to notice Tracy with &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; (1933). The story of a man&#x27;s rise to prosperity had a screenplay by Preston Sturges and Tracy&#x27;s performance as railroad tycoon Tom Garner received uniformly strong reviews. William Wilkerson of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote: &quot;This sterling performer has finally been given an opportunity to show an ability that has been boxed in by gangster roles ... [the film] has introduced Mr. Tracy as one of the screen&#x27;s best performers&quot;. Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated: &quot;No more convincing performance has been given on the screen than Spencer Tracy&#x27;s impersonation of Tom Garner.&quot; &quot;Shanghai Madness&quot; (1933), meanwhile, revealed Tracy to have a previously unseen sex appeal and served to advance his standing. Despite this attention, Tracy&#x27;s next two movies went largely unnoticed. &quot;Man&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1933) with Loretta Young was anticipated to be a hit, but made only a small profit. &quot;The Show-Off&quot; (1934), for which he was lent to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, proved popular, but his subsequent outings continued to be unsuccessful.

Tracy drank heavily during his years with Fox and gained a reputation as an alcoholic. He failed to report for filming on &quot;Marie Galante&quot; in June 1934, and was found in his hotel room, virtually unconscious after a two-week binge. Tracy was removed from the Fox payroll while he recovered in a hospital, and then sued for $125,000 for delaying the production. He completed only two more pictures with the studio.

The details on how Tracy&#x27;s relationship with Fox ended are unclear: later in life Tracy maintained that he was fired for his drunken behavior, but the Fox records do not support such an account. He was still under contract with the studio when MGM expressed their interest in the actor. They were in need of a new male star, and contacted Tracy on April 2, 1935, offering him a seven-year deal. That afternoon, the contract between Tracy and Fox was terminated &quot;by mutual consent&quot;. Tracy made a total of 25 pictures in the five years he was with Fox Film Corporation, most of which lost money at the box office.

===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (1935–1955)===

====Growing reputation====
In the 1930s, MGM was the most respected movie production studio in Hollywood. When Tracy arrived there, he was all but unknown. Biographer James Curtis writes: &quot;Tracy was scarcely a blip on the box office barometer in 1935, a critics&#x27; darling and little more&quot;. He was, however, well known for being a troublemaker. Producer Irving Thalberg was nevertheless enthusiastic about working with the actor, telling journalist Louella Parsons: &quot;Spencer Tracy will become one of MGM&#x27;s most valuable stars.&quot;

Curtis notes that the studio managed Tracy with care, a welcome change from the ineptitude and apathy he had known while at Fox, which was like &quot;a shot of adrenaline&quot; for the actor. His first film under the new contract was the quickly produced &quot;The Murder Man&quot; (1935), which included the feature film debut of James Stewart. Thalberg then began a strategy of pairing Tracy with the studio&#x27;s top actresses: &quot;Whipsaw&quot; (1935) co-starred Myrna Loy and was a commercial success. &quot;Riffraff&quot; (1936) put Tracy opposite Jean Harlow. Both films were, however, designed and promoted to showcase their leading ladies, thus continuing Tracy&#x27;s reputation as a secondary star.

&quot;Fury&quot; (1936) was the first film to prove that Tracy could make a success on his own merit. Directed by Fritz Lang, Tracy played an innocent man who swears revenge after narrowly escaping death by a lynch mob. The film and performance received excellent reviews. It made a profit of $1.3 million worldwide. Curtis writes: &quot;audiences who, just a year earlier, had no clear handle on him, were suddenly turning out to see him. It was a transition that was nothing short of miraculous ... [and showed] a willingness on the part of the public to embrace a leading man who was not textbook handsome nor bigger than life.&quot;
&quot;Fury&quot; was followed one month later with the release of the big-budget disaster movie &quot;San Francisco&quot; (1936). Tracy played a supporting role alongside Clark Gable in the film, allowing audiences to see him with the top male star in Hollywood. Taking on the role of a priest, Tracy reportedly felt a heavy responsibility in representing the church. Despite having only 17 minutes of screen time, Tracy was highly praised for his performance and received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. &quot;San Francisco&quot; became the highest-grossing picture of 1936. Donald Deschner, in his book on Tracy, credits &quot;Fury&quot; and &quot;San Francisco&quot; as the &quot;two films that changed his career and gave him the status of a major star&quot;.

By this point, Tracy entered a period of self-imposed sobriety and MGM expressed pleasure with Tracy&#x27;s professionalism. His public reputation continued to grow with &quot;Libeled Lady&quot; (also 1936), a screwball comedy that cast him with William Powell, Loy and Harlow. According to Curtis, &quot;Powell, Harlow and Loy were among the biggest draws in the industry, and equal billing in such a powerhouse company could only serve to advance Tracy&#x27;s standing&quot;. &quot;Libeled Lady&quot; was his third hit picture in the space of six months.

====Oscar wins====

Tracy appeared in four films released in 1937. &quot;They Gave Him a Gun&quot;, a crime-drama, went largely unnoticed, but &quot;Captains Courageous&quot; was one of the major film events of the year. Tracy played a Portuguese fisherman in the adventure movie, based on the novel by Rudyard Kipling. He was uncomfortable feigning a foreign accent, and resented having his hair curled, but the role was a hit with audiences and Tracy won the Academy Award for Best Actor. &quot;Captains Courageous&quot; was followed by &quot;Big City&quot; with Luise Rainer and &quot;Mannequin&quot; with Joan Crawford, the latter of which performed well at the box office. With two years of hit movies and industry recognition, Tracy became a star in the United States. A 1937 poll of 20 million people to find the &quot;King and Queen of Hollywood&quot; ranked Tracy sixth among males.

Tracy was reunited with Clark Gable and Myrna Loy for &quot;Test Pilot&quot; (1938). The film was another enormous commercial and critical success, permanently cementing the notion of Gable and Tracy as a team in the public imagination.

Based on the positive response he had received in &quot;San Francisco&quot;, MGM again cast Tracy as a priest in &quot;Boys Town&quot; (also 1938). Portraying Edward J. Flanagan, a Catholic priest and founder of Boys Town in Nebraska, was a role Tracy took seriously: &quot;I&#x27;m so anxious to do a good job as Father Flanagan that it worries me, keeps me awake at night.&quot; Tracy received strong reviews for his performance, and the movie grossed $4 million worldwide. For the second year running, Tracy received an Academy Award for Best Actor. He was humble about the recognition, saying in his acceptance speech: &quot;I honestly do not feel that I can accept this award ... I can accept it only as it was meant to be for a great man—Father Flanagan&quot;. Although he did keep his Oscar, a second statuette was struck and immediately sent to Flanagan. Tracy was listed as the fifth biggest box office star of 1938.

Tracy was absent from screens for almost a year before returning to Fox on loan and appearing as Henry M. Stanley in &quot;Stanley and Livingstone&quot; (1939) with Nancy Kelly. Curtis maintains that Tracy&#x27;s non-visibility did little to affect his standing with the public or exhibitors. In October 1939, a &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine survey of the nation&#x27;s favorite movie actors listed Tracy in first place.

====Established star====

MGM capitalized on Tracy&#x27;s popularity, casting him in four movies for 1940. &quot;I Take This Woman&quot; with Hedy Lamarr was a critical and commercial failure, but the historical drama &quot;Northwest Passage&quot;—Tracy&#x27;s first film in Technicolor—proved popular. He then portrayed Thomas Edison in &quot;Edison, the Man&quot;. Howard Barnes of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; was not charmed by the story, but wrote that Tracy, &quot;by sheer persuasion of his acting&quot;, made the film worthy. &quot;Boom Town&quot; was the third and final Gable-Tracy picture, also starring Claudette Colbert and Hedy Lamarr, making it one of the most anticipated films of the year. The film opened to the biggest crowd since &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;.

Tracy signed a new contract with MGM in April 1941, which paid $5,000 a week and limited him to three pictures a year (Tracy had previously expressed a need to reduce his workload). The contract also stated for the first time that his billing was to be &quot;that of a star&quot;. Contrary to popular belief, the contract did not include a clause that he receive top billing, but from this point onward, every film Tracy appeared in featured his name first.

Tracy returned to the role of Father Flanagan for the sequel &quot;Men of Boys Town&quot; (1941). It was followed by Tracy&#x27;s only venture into the horror genre, an adaptation of &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (also 1941), co-starring Ingrid Bergman and Lana Turner. Tracy was unhappy with the film, disliking the heavy make-up he needed to portray Hyde. Critical response to the film was mixed and brought Tracy the only negative reviews of his career. Theodore Strauss of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Mr. Tracy&#x27;s portrait of Hyde is not so much evil incarnate as it is the ham rampant.&quot; The film was financially successful, however, taking in more than $2 million at the box office.

Tracy was set to star in a film version of &quot;The Yearling&quot; for 1942, but several on-set difficulties and bad weather on location forced MGM to shelve the production. With the end of that project, he became available for the new Katharine Hepburn film, &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; (1942). Hepburn greatly admired Tracy, calling him &quot;the best movie actor there was&quot;. She had wanted him for her comeback vehicle, &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940). Hepburn was delighted that Tracy was available for &quot;Woman of the Year&quot;, saying &quot;I was just damned grateful he was willing to work with me.&quot; The romantic comedy performed well at the box office and received strong reviews. William Boehnel wrote in the &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot;, &quot;To begin with, it has Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy in the leading roles. This in itself would be enough to make any film memorable. But when you get Tracy and Hepburn turning in brilliant performances to boot, you&#x27;ve got something to cheer about.&quot;

&quot;Woman of the Year&quot; was followed by an adaptation of John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot; (also 1942) which met with a tepid response. MGM did not hesitate to repeat the teaming of Tracy and Hepburn and cast them in the dark mystery &quot;Keeper of the Flame&quot; (1943). Despite a weak critical reception the film out-grossed &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; confirming the strength of their partnership.

Tracy&#x27;s next three appearances were all war-based. &quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot; (1943) with Irene Dunne surpassed &quot;San Francisco&quot; to become his highest-grossing film to date. &quot;The Seventh Cross&quot; (1944), a suspense film about an escape from a Nazi concentration camp, met with critical acclaim. It was followed by the aviation film &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; (1944). On the strength of these three releases, the annual Quigley poll revealed Tracy was MGM&#x27;s biggest money-making star of 1944, His only film the following year was his third with Hepburn, &quot;Without Love&quot; (1945), a light romantic comedy that performed well at the box office despite muted enthusiasm from critics.

====Stage and screen====
In 1945, Tracy returned to the stage for the first time in 15 years. He had been through a dark patch personally—culminating with a hospital stay—and Hepburn felt that a play would help restore his focus. Tracy told a journalist in April, &quot;I&#x27;m coming back to Broadway to see if I can still act.&quot; The play was &quot;The Rugged Path&quot; by Robert E. Sherwood. It first previewed in Providence on September 28, to a sold-out crowd and tepid response. It was a difficult production; director Garson Kanin later wrote: &quot;In the ten days prior to the New York opening all the important relationships had deteriorated. Spencer was tense and unbending, could not, or would not, take direction&quot;. Tracy considered leaving the show before it even opened on Broadway, and lasted there just six weeks before announcing his intention to close the show. It closed on January 19, 1946, after 81 performances. Tracy later explained to a friend: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t say those goddamn lines over and over and over again every night ... At least every day is a new day for me in films ... But this thing—every day, every day, over and over again.&quot;

Tracy was absent from screens in 1946, the first year since his motion picture debut that there was no Spencer Tracy release. His next film was &quot;The Sea of Grass&quot; (1947), a melodrama set in the American Old West with Hepburn. Similar to &quot;Keeper of the Flame&quot; and &quot;Without Love&quot;, a lukewarm response from critics did not stop it from being a financial success both at home and abroad. He followed it later that year with &quot;Cass Timberlane&quot;, in which he played a judge. It was a commercial success, but Curtis notes that co-star Lana Turner overshadowed Tracy in most of the reviews.

A fifth film with Hepburn, Frank Capra&#x27;s political drama &quot;State of the Union&quot;, was released in 1948. Tracy played a presidential candidate in the movie, which was warmly received. He then appeared in &quot;Edward, My Son&quot; (1949) with Deborah Kerr. Tracy disliked the role, and told director George Cukor, &quot;It&#x27;s rather disconcerting to me to find how easily I play a heel.&quot; Upon its release, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote of the &quot;hopeless miscasting of Mr. Tracy&quot;. The film became Tracy&#x27;s biggest money-loser at MGM.

Tracy finished off the 1940s with &quot;Malaya&quot; (1949), an adventure film with James Stewart, and &quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot; (also 1949), a comedy with Tracy and Hepburn playing married lawyers who oppose each other in court. Tracy and Hepburn&#x27;s friends, Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon, wrote the parts specifically for the two leads. The film received strong reviews and became the highest-grossing Tracy-Hepburn picture to date. Film critic Bosley Crowther wrote, &quot;Mr. Tracy and Miss Hepburn are the stellar performers in this show and their perfect compatibility in comic capers is delightful to see.&quot;

====Final MGM years====
Tracy received his first Academy Award nomination in 12 years for playing the role of Stanley Banks in &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; (1950). In the comedy film, Banks attempts to handle preparations for the upcoming wedding of his daughter (Elizabeth Taylor). &quot;It&#x27;s the second strong comedy in a row for Spencer Tracy, doing the title role, and he socks it&quot;, &quot;Variety&quot; commented. The film was the biggest commercial success of Tracy&#x27;s career to date, earning $6 million worldwide. MGM wanted a sequel, and while Tracy was unsure, he accepted. &quot;Father&#x27;s Little Dividend&quot; (1951) was released ten months later and performed well at the box office. On the strength of the two movies, Tracy polled as one of the nation&#x27;s top stars once more.

Tracy portrayed a lawyer in &quot;The People Against O&#x27;Hara&quot; (1951) and re-teamed with Hepburn for the sports comedy &quot;Pat and Mike&quot; (1952), the second feature written expressly for them by Kanin and Gordon. &quot;Pat and Mike&quot; became one of the duo&#x27;s most popular and critically acclaimed films. Tracy followed it with &quot;Plymouth Adventure&quot; (also 1952), a historical drama set aboard the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, co-starring Gene Tierney. It met with poor critical and box office response and posted a loss of $1.8 million for MGM. Tracy returned to the role of a concerned father in &quot;The Actress&quot; (1953). Producer Lawrence Weingarten recalled: &quot;That film ... got more [acclaim] from the critics than any film I ever made in all the years, and we didn&#x27;t make enough to pay for the ushers in the theatre.&quot; For his performance in &quot;The Actress&quot;, Tracy won a Golden Globe Award and received a nomination for the British Academy Film Award.

MGM lent Tracy to Fox for the well-received Western film &quot;Broken Lance&quot;, his only film released in 1954. In 1955, Tracy turned down William Wyler&#x27;s &quot;The Desperate Hours&quot; because he refused to take second-billing to Humphrey Bogart. Instead, Tracy appeared as a one-armed protagonist who faces the hostility of a small desert town in &quot;Bad Day at Black Rock&quot; (1955), a film directed by John Sturges. For his work, Tracy received a fifth Oscar nomination and was awarded the Best Actor prize at the Cannes Film Festival.

Tracy had personally been unhappy with the picture and threatened to leave during production. This behavior became a regular occurrence for Tracy, who was increasingly lethargic and cynical. He began production on &quot;Tribute to a Bad Man&quot; in the summer of 1955, but pulled out when he claimed that the shooting location in the Colorado mountains gave him altitude sickness. The problems caused by the picture fractured Tracy&#x27;s relationship with MGM. In June 1955, he was one of the two remaining stars of the studio&#x27;s peak years (the other being Robert Taylor), but with his contract up for renewal, Tracy opted to freelance for the first time in his movie career.

===Independent player (1956–1967)===
Tracy&#x27;s first post-MGM appearance was in &quot;The Mountain&quot; (1956) with Robert Wagner, who played his much younger brother (Wagner had earlier played his son in &quot;Broken Lance&quot;). The location filming in the French Alps proved a difficult experience, and he threatened to leave the project. His performance earned a BAFTA nomination for Best Foreign Actor. Tracy and Hepburn then paired together for the eighth time in the office-based comedy &quot;Desk Set&quot; (1957). He again had to be convinced to stay with the film, one which met with a weak response.

Tracy appeared in &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; (1958), a project that had been in development for five years. An adaptation of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s novella of the same title, Hemingway&#x27;s agent, Leland Hayward, had previously written to the author: &quot;Of all Hollywood people, the one that comes the closest to me in quality, in personality and voice, in personal dignity and ability, is Spencer Tracy.&quot; Tracy was delighted to be offered the role. He was told to lose some of his 210 pounds before filming began but failed to do so. Hemingway thus reported that Tracy was a &quot;terrible liability to the picture&quot;, and had to be reassured that the star was being carefully photographed to disguise his weight problem. Appearing alone on screen for most of the film, Tracy considered &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; the toughest part he ever played. In reviewing the performance, Jack Moffitt of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said it was &quot;so intimate and revealing of universal human experience that, to me, it almost transcended acting and became reality&quot;. Tracy received Oscar and BAFTA Award nominations for the work.

After abandoning two projects, including a proposed remake of &quot;The Blue Angel&quot; with Marilyn Monroe, Tracy&#x27;s next feature was &quot;The Last Hurrah&quot; (1958). It reunited him with his debut director, John Ford, after 28 years and his childhood friend Pat O&#x27;Brien. Tracy took a year to commit to the project, in which he played an Irish-American mayor seeking re-election. The movie was favorably reviewed, but not commercially successful. At the end of 1958, the National Board of Review named Tracy the year&#x27;s Best Actor. He nevertheless began to ponder retirement, with Curtis writing that he was &quot;chronically tired, unhappy, ill, and uninterested in work&quot;.

====Stanley Kramer partnership====
Tracy did not appear on the screen again until the release of &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; (1960), a film based on the 1925 Scopes &quot;Monkey Trial&quot; which debated the right to teach evolution in schools. Director Stanley Kramer sought Tracy for the role of lawyer Henry Drummond (based on Clarence Darrow), from the outset. Starring opposite Tracy was Fredric March, a pairing &quot;Variety&quot; described as &quot;a stroke of casting genius ... Both men are spellbinders in the most laudatory sense of the word.&quot; The film garnered Tracy some of the strongest reviews of his career—he was nominated for an Academy Award, BAFTA Award and Golden Globe Award for the performance—but it was not a commercial hit.

In the volcano disaster movie &quot;The Devil at 4 O&#x27;Clock&quot; (1961), Tracy played a priest for the fourth time in his career. His co-star, Frank Sinatra, ceded top-billing to guarantee Tracy for the picture. Continuing his pattern of indecisiveness, Tracy briefly pulled out of the production before recommitting. Critics were unenthusiastic about the film, which was nevertheless Tracy&#x27;s most successful box-office outing since &quot;Father of the Bride&quot;.

&quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; began an enduring collaboration between Stanley Kramer and Tracy—Kramer directed Tracy&#x27;s three final films. &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot;, released at the end of 1961, was their second feature together. The film depicts the &quot;Judges&#x27; Trial&quot;, the trial of Nazi judges for their role in the Holocaust. Abby Mann wrote the role of Judge Haywood with Tracy in mind; Tracy called it the best script he had ever read. At the end of the film, Tracy delivered a 13-minute speech. He recorded it in one take and received a round of applause from the cast and crew. Upon seeing the film, Mann wrote to Tracy: &quot;Every writer ought to have the experience of having Spencer Tracy do his lines. There is nothing in the world quite like it.&quot; The film met with positive reviews and a large audience; Tracy received an eighth Oscar nomination for his performance.

Tracy turned down roles in &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Leopard&quot; (1963), and had to pull out of MGM&#x27;s all-star &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1962) when it clashed with &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot;. He was, however, able to record the film&#x27;s narration track. Tracy was in very poor health by this time, and working became a challenge. In 1962, he took the role of Captain T. G. Culpeper in Kramer&#x27;s comedy &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963), a small but key part that he was able to complete in nine non-consecutive days. The film was released in November 1963. Tracy&#x27;s name topped the list of performers, and the comedy became one of the highest-grossing American films of the year. As his health worsened, he had to cancel commitments to &quot;Cheyenne Autumn&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Cincinnati Kid&quot; (1965). Film offers continued to come, but Tracy did not work again until 1967 when he took the starring role in Kramer&#x27;s &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot; (1967), Tracy&#x27;s ninth and final film with Hepburn.

&quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot; explored the topic of interracial marriage, with Tracy playing a liberal-minded newspaper publisher whose values are challenged when his daughter wishes to marry a black man, played by Sidney Poitier. Tracy appeared happy to be working again, but he told journalists visiting the set that the movie would be his last for he would permanently retire after filming due to his health problems. To commence filming, Tracy had to be insured for the high premium of $71,000 if he died during filming; Hepburn and Kramer both put their salaries in escrow until Tracy completed his scenes. In poor health, Tracy could work for only two or three hours each day. He completed his last scene on May 24, 1967. Tracy died 17 days later from a heart attack on June 10.

The film was released in December 1967, and although reviews were mixed, Curtis notes that &quot;Tracy&#x27;s performance was singled out for praise in nearly every instance.&quot; Brendan Gill of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that Tracy gave &quot;a faultless and, under the circumstances, heartbreaking performance&quot;. The movie became Tracy&#x27;s highest grossing picture. He received a posthumous nomination for Best Actor—his ninth—at the 40th Academy Awards, along with a Golden Globe Award nomination and a BAFTA win for Best Actor.

==Personal life==

===Marriage and family===
Tracy met actress Louise Treadwell while they were both members of the Wood Players in White Plains, New York—the first stock company Tracy joined after graduating. The couple was engaged in May 1923, and married on September 10 of that year between the matinee and evening performances of his show.

Their son, John Ten Broeck Tracy, was born in June 1924. When John was 10 months old, Louise discovered that the boy was deaf. She resisted telling Tracy for three months. Tracy was devastated by the news and felt lifelong guilt over his son&#x27;s deafness. He was convinced that John&#x27;s hearing impairment was a punishment for his own sins. As a result, Tracy had trouble connecting with his son and distanced himself from his family. Joseph L. Mankiewicz, a friend of Tracy&#x27;s, later theorized: &quot;[Tracy] didn&#x27;t leave Louise. He left the scene of his guilt.&quot; A second child, Louise &quot;Susie&quot; Treadwell Tracy, was born in July 1932. The children were raised in their mother&#x27;s Episcopal faith.

Tracy left the family home in 1933, and he and Louise openly discussed the separation with the media, maintaining that they were still friends and had not taken divorce action. From September 1933 to June 1934, Tracy had a public affair with Loretta Young, his co-star in &quot;Man&#x27;s Castle&quot;. He reconciled with Louise in 1935. There was never again an official separation between Tracy and his wife, but the marriage continued to be troubled. Tracy increasingly lived in hotels and by the 1940s, the two were effectively living separate lives. Tracy frequently engaged in extramarital affairs, including with co-stars Joan Crawford in 1937 and Ingrid Bergman in 1941. He had an affair with Myrna Loy in 1935 and 1936. In 1990, during a phone interview with educator Alan Greenberg, Loy revealed she was in love with Tracy. &quot;I loved Spence, he was adorable...I loved him and I really did love him. I loved him. I mean I was in love with him and she [Katharine Hepburn] got in the way.&quot; Later, during the 1940s, Loy regularly visited Tracy at Beverly Hills in his hotel room.

===Katharine Hepburn===

While making &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; in September 1941, Tracy began what was to become a lifelong relationship with Katharine Hepburn. The actress became devoted to him, and their relationship lasted until his death 26 years later. Tracy never returned to live in the family home, although he visited regularly.

The MGM moguls were careful to protect their stars from controversy, and Tracy wished to conceal his relationship with Hepburn from his wife, so it was hidden from the public. The couple did not live together until the final years of Tracy&#x27;s life, when they shared a cottage on George Cukor&#x27;s estate in Beverly Hills. In Hollywood, however, the intimate nature of the Tracy-Hepburn partnership was an open secret. Angela Lansbury, who worked with the pair on &quot;State of the Union&quot;, later said: &quot;We all knew, but nobody ever said anything. In those days it wasn&#x27;t discussed.&quot; Tracy was not someone to express his emotions, but Tracy&#x27;s friend, actress Betsy Drake believed that he &quot;was &quot;utterly&quot; dependent upon Hepburn&quot;. Tracy&#x27;s infidelity apparently continued, however, and he reportedly had an affair with Gene Tierney during the making of &quot;Plymouth Adventure&quot; in 1952.

Neither Tracy nor his wife ever pursued a divorce, despite their estrangement. He told Joan Fontaine, &quot;I can get a divorce whenever I want to, but my wife and Kate like things just as they are.&quot; Louise, meanwhile, reportedly commented, &quot;I will be Mrs. Spencer Tracy until the day I die.&quot; Hepburn did not interfere and never fought for marriage.

===Character===
Tracy was an avowed Catholic, but his cousin, Jane Feely, said that he did not devoutly follow the religion: &quot;He was often not a practical Catholic either. I would call him a spiritual Catholic.&quot; Garson Kanin, a friend of Tracy&#x27;s for 25 years, described him as &quot;a true believer&quot; who respected his religion. At periods in his life, Tracy attended Mass regularly. Tracy did not believe actors should publicize their political views, but in 1940 lent his name to the &quot;Hollywood for Roosevelt&quot; committee and personally identified as a Democrat.

Tracy struggled with alcoholism throughout his adult life, an ailment that ran in his father&#x27;s side of the family. Rather than being a steady drinker, as commonly thought, he was prone to periods of binging on alcohol. Loretta Young remarked that Tracy was &quot;awful&quot; when he was drunk, and he was twice arrested for his behavior while intoxicated. Because of this bad reaction to alcohol, Tracy regularly embarked on prolonged periods of sobriety and developed an all-or-nothing routine. Myrna Loy said: &quot;Days of drinking had left him belligerent.&quot; Hepburn commented that he would stop drinking for &quot;months, even years at a time&quot; before falling off the wagon without warning.

Tracy was prone to bouts of depression and anxiety: he was described by Mrs. Tracy as having &quot;the most volatile disposition I&#x27;ve ever seen—up in the clouds one minute and down in the depths the next. And when he&#x27;s low, he&#x27;s very, very low.&quot; He was plagued by insomnia throughout his life. As a result, Tracy became dependent on barbiturates to sleep, followed by dexedrine to function. Hepburn, who adopted a nursing role towards Tracy, was unable to understand her partner&#x27;s unhappiness. She wrote in her autobiography: &quot;What was it? ... Never at peace ... Tortured by some sort of guilt. Some terrible misery.&quot;

===Illness and death===

Tracy&#x27;s adult life of alcoholism, smoking cigarettes, taking pills and being overweight left him in poor health by the time he reached his 60s. On July 21, 1963, Tracy was hospitalized after a severe attack of breathlessness. Doctors found that he was suffering from pulmonary edema, where fluid accumulates in the lungs due to an inability of the heart to pump properly. They also declared his blood pressure dangerously high. From this point on Tracy remained very weak, and Hepburn moved into his home to provide constant care. In January 1965, he was diagnosed with hypertensive heart disease and also began treatment for a previously ignored diagnosis of Type II diabetes. Tracy almost died in September 1965: a stay in the hospital following a prostatectomy resulted in his kidneys failing, and he spent the night in a coma. His recovery the next day was described by his attending doctor as &quot;a kind of miracle&quot;.

Tracy spent most of the next two years at home with Hepburn, living what she described as a quiet life: reading, painting, and listening to music. On June 10, 1967, 17 days after completing what was his last film role in &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot;, Tracy awakened at 3:00 am to make himself a cup of tea in his Beverly Hills apartment. Hepburn described in her autobiography how she followed him to the kitchen: &quot;Just as I was about to give [the door] a push, there was a sound of a cup smashing to the floor—then clump—a loud clump.&quot; She entered the room to find Tracy lying dead from a heart attack. He was 67. Hepburn recalled, &quot;He looked so happy to be done with living, which for all his accomplishments had been a frightful burden for him.&quot; MGM publicist Howard Strickling told the media that Tracy had been alone when he died and was found by his housekeeper.

A Requiem Mass was held for Tracy on June 12 at the Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church in East Hollywood. Active pallbearers included George Cukor, Stanley Kramer, Frank Sinatra, James Stewart, and John Ford. Out of consideration for Tracy&#x27;s family, Hepburn did not attend the funeral. Tracy is interred at Glendale&#x27;s Forest Lawn Memorial Park, near his wife Louise, son John and daughter Susie.

==Reputation and acting style==
Tracy had a solid reputation among his peers and received considerable praise from the film industry. After his death, MGM head Dore Schary said that there &quot;can be no question that [Tracy] was the best and most protean actor of our screen&quot;. He was referred to as the greatest actor of his generation by Clark Gable, James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, John Ford, Garson Kanin, and Katharine Hepburn. Actor Richard Widmark, who idolized Tracy, called him &quot;the greatest movie actor there ever was&quot; and said that he had &quot;learned more about acting from watching Tracy than in any other way&quot;.

Tracy was particularly respected for his naturalism onscreen. Hume Cronyn, who worked with Tracy on &quot;The Seventh Cross&quot;, admired his screen presence: &quot;His method appeared to be as simple as it is difficult to achieve. He appeared to do nothing. He listened, he felt, he said the words without forcing anything.&quot; Joan Crawford likewise expressed her admiration for Tracy&#x27;s seemingly effortless performances, stating that it was &quot;inspiring&quot; to co-star with him and that &quot;his is such simplicity of performance, such naturalness and humor [...] he walks through a scene [and] makes it seem so easy&quot;. His four-time co-star Joan Bennett said that she &quot;never had the feeling he was &#x27;acting&#x27; in a scene, but the truth of the situation was actually happening, spontaneously, at the moment he spoke his lines&quot;. Cagney noted that Tracy was rarely the target of impressionists because &quot;you can&#x27;t mimic reserve and control very well [...] there&#x27;s nothing to imitate except his genius and that can&#x27;t be mimicked&quot;.

Tracy was praised for his listening and reacting skills; Barry Nelson said that he &quot;brought the art of reacting to a new height&quot;, while Stanley Kramer declared that he &quot;thought and listened better than anyone in the history of motion pictures&quot;. Millard Kaufman noted that Tracy &quot;listened with every fiber of his entire body&quot;. In his memoir, Burt Reynolds noted Tracy&#x27;s emphasis on naturalism when, as a rookie actor, he observed Tracy on the set of &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;. Reynolds later introduced himself to Tracy as an actor and Tracy replied, &quot;An actor, huh? Just remember not to ever let anyone catch you at it.&quot;

Despite the perception that he was able to turn up to a shoot and perform effortlessly, Tracy&#x27;s acquaintances said that he would carefully prepare for each role in private. Joseph L. Mankiewicz lived with him during the production of &quot;Test Pilot&quot;, and recounted that Tracy would lock himself in his bedroom &quot;working extremely hard&quot; each night. Many co-workers commented on his strong work ethic and professionalism. However, he did not like to rehearse and would quickly lose his &quot;effectiveness&quot; after shooting two or three takes of the same scene. Kanin described him as &quot;an instinctive player, who trusted the moment of creation&quot;. Tracy&#x27;s close friend Chester Erskine pinpointed his acting style as one of &quot;selection&quot;, stating that he strove to give as little as was needed to be effective and reached &quot;a minimum to make the maximum&quot;.

Tracy disliked being asked about his technique or what advice he would give to others. He often belittled the profession of acting, once saying to Kanin, &quot;Why do actors think they&#x27;re so goddamn important? They&#x27;re not. Acting is not an important job in the scheme of things. Plumbing is.&quot; He was also humble about his abilities, telling a journalist, &quot;It&#x27;s just that I try no tricks. No profile. No &#x27;great lover&#x27; act ... I just project myself as I am—plain, trying to be honest.&quot; He was known to have enjoyed the quip once made by Alfred Lunt, &quot;The art of acting is: learn your lines and don&#x27;t bump into the furniture!&quot; Hepburn, in an interview six years after Tracy&#x27;s death, suggested that Tracy wished he had held a different profession.

==Assessment and legacy==
In the 21st century, Tracy is best known to general audiences for his association with Katharine Hepburn. He continues to receive praise from film scholars: critic Leonard Maltin calls Tracy &quot;one of the 20th century&#x27;s finest actors&quot;, while film historian Jeanine Basinger describes his career as a &quot;golden record of movie achievement&quot;. Charles Matthews, writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, argues that &quot;Tracy deserves to be remembered for himself, as a master of acting technique&quot;.

An award for excellence in film acting is bestowed in Tracy&#x27;s name at the University of California, Los Angeles. Past recipients of the UCLA Spencer Tracy Award include Kirk Douglas, Michael Douglas, Morgan Freeman, Tom Hanks, Anthony Hopkins, James Stewart, and Denzel Washington.

A 1986 PBS documentary titled &quot;The Spencer Tracy Legacy&quot; was hosted by Hepburn. It includes clips from Tracy&#x27;s films, and behind-the-scenes archival footage and home movies of Tracy&#x27;s private life and career, as well as newly filmed interviews with many of his former co-stars, and with his daughter Susie Tracy. In 2009, Tracy provided inspiration for the character Carl in Pixar&#x27;s Oscar-winning film &quot;Up&quot;. Director Pete Docter explained that there is &quot;something sweet about these grumpy old guys&quot;. In 2014, a film about Tracy&#x27;s relationship with Katharine Hepburn was announced to be in development.

Several of Tracy&#x27;s films, particularly his comedies, are regarded as classics of American cinema. He starred in four of the titles on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of &quot;100 Years ... 100 Laughs&quot;: &quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;, &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; and &quot;Woman of the Year&quot;. &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot; was included on AFI&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest American movies, while &quot;Captains Courageous&quot; was featured on their list of America&#x27;s most inspiring movies.

==Awards and nominations==
Tracy was nominated for nine Academy Awards for Best Actor, a category record he holds with Laurence Olivier. He was the first of nine actors to win the award twice, and is one of two actors to receive it consecutively, the other being Tom Hanks. Tracy was also nominated for five British Academy Film Awards, of which he won two, and four Golden Globe Awards, winning once. In addition, he received the Cannes Film Festival award for Best Actor and was once named Best Actor by the National Board of Review.

<doc id="45783" wikidata="Q5533517" url="?curid=45783" title="Genotype–phenotype distinction">
<text>The genotype–phenotype distinction is drawn in genetics. The &quot;genotype&quot; is an organism&#x27;s full hereditary information. The &quot;phenotype&quot; is an organism&#x27;s actual observed properties, such as morphology, development, or behavior. This distinction is fundamental in the study of inheritance of traits and their evolution.

==Overview==
The terms &quot;genotype&quot; and &quot;phenotype&quot; were created by Wilhelm Johannsen in 1911, although the meaning of the terms and the significance of the distinction have evolved since they were introduced.

It is the organism&#x27;s physical properties that directly determine its chances of survival and reproductive output, but the inheritance of physical properties is dependent on the inheritance of genes. Therefore, understanding the theory of evolution via natural selection requires understanding the genotype–phenotype distinction. The genes contribute to a trait, and the phenotype is the observable manifestation of the genes (and therefore the genotype that affects the trait). If a white mouse had recessive genes that caused the genes responsible for color to be inactive, its genotype would be responsible for its phenotype (the white color).

The mapping of a set of genotypes to a set of phenotypes is sometimes referred to as the genotype–phenotype map.
An organism&#x27;s genotype is a major (the largest by far for morphology) influencing factor in the development of its phenotype, but it is not the only one. Even two organisms with identical genotypes may differ in their phenotypes, due to phenotypic plasticity. To what extent a particular genotype influences a phenotype depends on the relative dominance, penetrance, and expresivity of the alleles in question.

One experiences this in everyday life with monozygous (i.e. identical) twins. Identical twins share the same genotype, since their genomes are identical; but they never have the same phenotype, although their phenotypes may be very similar. This is apparent in the fact that close relations can always tell them apart, even though others might not be able to see the subtle differences. Further, identical twins can be distinguished by their fingerprints, which are never completely identical.

==Phenotypic plasticity==
The concept of phenotypic plasticity defines the degree to which an organism&#x27;s phenotype is determined by its genotype. A high level of plasticity means that environmental factors have a strong influence on the particular phenotype that develops. If there is little plasticity, the phenotype of an organism can be reliably predicted from knowledge of the genotype, regardless of environmental peculiarities during development. An example of high plasticity can be observed in larval newts1: when these larvae sense the presence of predators such as dragonflies, they develop larger heads and tails relative to their body size and display darker pigmentation. Larvae with these traits have a higher chance of survival when exposed to the predators, but grow more slowly than other phenotypes.

==Genetic canalization==
In contrast to phenotypic plasticity, the concept of genetic canalization addresses the extent to which an organism&#x27;s phenotype allows conclusions about its genotype. A phenotype is said to be canalized if mutations (changes in the genome) do not noticeably affect the physical properties of the organism. This means that a canalized phenotype may form from a large variety of different genotypes, in which case it is not possible to exactly predict the genotype from knowledge of the phenotype (i.e. the genotype–phenotype map is not invertible). If canalization is not present, small changes in the genome have an immediate effect on the phenotype that develops.

==Importance to evolutionary biology==

According to Lewontin, the theoretical task for population genetics is a process in two spaces: a &quot;genotypic space&quot; and a &quot;phenotypic space&quot;. The challenge of a &quot;complete&quot; theory of population genetics is to provide a set of laws that predictably map a population of genotypes (&quot;G&quot;1) to a phenotype space (&quot;P&quot;1), where selection takes place, and another set of laws that map the resulting population (&quot;P&quot;2) back to genotype space (&quot;G&quot;2) where Mendelian genetics can predict the next generation of genotypes, thus completing the cycle. Even if non-Mendelian aspects of molecular genetics are ignored, this is a gargantuan task. Visualizing the transformation schematically:

:formula_1

(adapted from Lewontin 1974, p. 12). &quot;T&quot;1 represents the genetic and epigenetic laws, the aspects of functional biology, or development, that transform a genotype into phenotype. This is the &quot;genotype–phenotype map&quot;. &quot;T&quot;2 is the transformation due to natural selection, &quot;T&quot;3 are epigenetic relations that predict genotypes based on the selected phenotypes and finally &quot;T&quot;4 the rules of Mendelian genetics.

In practice, there are two bodies of evolutionary theory that exist in parallel, traditional population genetics operating in the genotype space and the biometric theory used in plant and animal breeding, operating in phenotype space. The missing part is the mapping between the genotype and phenotype space. This leads to a &quot;sleight of hand&quot; (as Lewontin terms it) whereby variables in the equations of one domain, are considered parameters or &quot;constants&quot;, where, in a full-treatment, they would be transformed themselves by the evolutionary process and are &quot;functions&quot; of the state variables in the other domain. The &quot;sleight of hand&quot; is assuming that the mapping is known. Proceeding as if it is understood is enough to analyze many cases of interest. For example, if the phenotype is almost one-to-one with genotype (sickle-cell disease) or the time-scale is sufficiently short, the &quot;constants&quot; can be treated as such; however, there are also many situations where that assumption does not hold.

<text>Biomimetics or biomimicry is the emulation of the models, systems, and elements of nature for the purpose of solving complex human problems. The terms &quot;biomimetics&quot; and &quot;biomimicry&quot; are derived from (&quot;bios&quot;), life, and μίμησις (&quot;mīmēsis&quot;), imitation, from μιμεῖσθαι (&quot;mīmeisthai&quot;), to imitate, from μῖμος (&quot;mimos&quot;), actor. A closely related field is bionics.

Nature has gone through evolution over the 3.8 billion years since life is estimated to have appeared on the Earth. It has evolved species with high performance using commonly found materials. Surfaces of solids interact with other surfaces and the environment and derive the properties of materials. Biological materials are highly organized from the molecular to the nano-, micro-, and macroscales, often in a hierarchical manner with intricate nanoarchitecture that ultimately makes up a myriad of different functional elements. Properties of materials and surfaces result from a complex interplay between surface structure and morphology and physical and chemical properties. Many materials, surfaces, and objects in general provide multifunctionality.

Various materials, structures, and devices have been fabricated for commercial interest by engineers, material scientists, chemists, and biologists, and for beauty, structure, and design by artists and architects. Nature has solved engineering problems such as self-healing abilities, environmental exposure tolerance and resistance, hydrophobicity, self-assembly, and harnessing solar energy. Economic impact of bioinspired materials and surfaces is significant, on the order of several hundred billion dollars per year worldwide. 
== History ==
One of the early examples of biomimicry was the study of birds to enable human flight. Although never successful in creating a &quot;flying machine&quot;, Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) was a keen observer of the anatomy and flight of birds, and made numerous notes and sketches on his observations as well as sketches of &quot;flying machines&quot;. The Wright Brothers, who succeeded in flying the first heavier-than-air aircraft in 1903, allegedly derived inspiration from observations of pigeons in flight.

During the 1950s, the American biophysicist and polymath Otto Schmitt developed the concept of &quot;biomimetics&quot;. During his doctoral research, he developed the Schmitt trigger by studying the nerves in squid, attempting to engineer a device that replicated the biological system of nerve propagation. He continued to focus on devices that mimic natural systems and by 1957 he had perceived a converse to the standard view of biophysics at that time, a view he would come to call biomimetics.

In 1960, Jack E. Steele coined a similar term, &quot;bionics&quot;, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, where Otto Schmitt also worked. Steele defined bionics as &quot;the science of systems which have some function copied from nature, or which represent characteristics of natural systems or their analogues&quot;. During a later meeting in 1963, Schmitt stated:

In 1969, Schmitt used the term &quot;biomimetic&quot; in the title one of his papers, and by 1974 it had found its way into &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;. Bionics entered the same dictionary earlier in 1960 as &quot;a science concerned with the application of data about the functioning of biological systems to the solution of engineering problems&quot;. Bionic took on a different connotation when Martin Caidin referenced Jack Steele and his work in the novel &quot;Cyborg&quot;, which later resulted in the 1974 television series &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; and its spin-offs. The term bionic then became associated with &quot;the use of electronically operated artificial body parts&quot; and &quot;having ordinary human powers increased by or as if by the aid of such devices&quot;. Because the term &quot;bionic&quot; took on the implication of supernatural strength, the scientific community in English speaking countries largely abandoned it.

The term &quot;biomimicry&quot; appeared as early as 1982. Biomimicry was popularized by scientist and author Janine Benyus in her 1997 book &quot;Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature&quot;. Biomimicry is defined in the book as a &quot;new science that studies nature&#x27;s models and then imitates or takes inspiration from these designs and processes to solve human problems&quot;. Benyus suggests looking to Nature as a &quot;Model, Measure, and Mentor&quot; and emphasizes sustainability as an objective of biomimicry.

The potential long-term impacts of biomimicry were quantified in a 2013 Fermanian Business &amp; Economic Institute Report commissioned by the San Diego Zoo. The findings demonstrated the potential economic and environmental benefits of biomimicry, which can be further seen in Johannes-Paul Fladerer and Ernst Kurzmann&#x27;s &quot;managemANT&quot; approach. This term (a combination of the words &quot;management&quot; and &quot;ant&quot;), describes the usage of behavioural strategies of ants in economic and management strategies.

== Bio-inspired technologies ==
Biomimetics could in principle be applied in many fields. Because of the diversity and complexity of biological systems, the number of features that might be imitated is large. Biomimetic applications are at various stages of development from technologies that might become commercially usable to prototypes. Murray&#x27;s law, which in conventional form determined the optimum diameter of blood vessels, has been re-derived to provide simple equations for the pipe or tube diameter which gives a minimum mass engineering system.

=== Locomotion ===

Aircraft wing design and flight techniques are being inspired by birds and bats. The aerodynamics of streamlined design of improved Japanese high speed train Shinkansen 500 Series were modelled after the beak of Kingfisher bird.

Biorobots based on the physiology and methods of locomotion of animals include BionicKangaroo which moves like a kangaroo, saving energy from one jump and transferring it to its next jump; Kamigami Robots, a children&#x27;s toy, mimic cockroach locomotion to run quickly and efficiently over indoor and outdoor surfaces, and Pleobot, a shrimp-inspired robot to study metachronal swimming and the ecological impacts of this propulsive gait on the environment.

=== Biomimetic flying robots (BFRs) ===

BFRs take inspiration from flying mammals, birds, or insects. BFRs can have flapping wings, which generate the lift and thrust, or they can be propeller actuated. BFRs with flapping wings have increased stroke efficiencies, increased maneuverability, and reduced energy consumption in comparison to propeller actuated BFRs. Mammal and bird inspired BFRs share similar flight characteristics and design considerations. For instance, both mammal and bird inspired BFRs minimize edge fluttering and pressure-induced wingtip curl by increasing the rigidity of the wing edge and wingtips. Mammal and insect inspired BFRs can be impact resistant, making them useful in cluttered environments.

Mammal inspired BFRs typically take inspiration from bats, but the flying squirrel has also inspired a prototype. Examples of bat inspired BFRs include Bat Bot and the DALER. Mammal inspired BFRs can be designed to be multi-modal; therefore, they&#x27;re capable of both flight and terrestrial movement. To reduce the impact of landing, shock absorbers can be implemented along the wings. Alternatively, the BFR can pitch up and increase the amount of drag it experiences. By increasing the drag force, the BFR will decelerate and minimize the impact upon grounding. Different land gait patterns can also be implemented.

Bird inspired BFRs can take inspiration from raptors, gulls, and everything in-between. Bird inspired BFRs can be feathered to increase the angle of attack range over which the prototype can operate before stalling. The wings of bird inspired BFRs allow for in-plane deformation, and the in-plane wing deformation can be adjusted to maximize flight efficiency depending on the flight gait. An example of a raptor inspired BFR is the prototype by Savastano et al. The prototype has fully deformable flapping wings and is capable of carrying a payload of up to 0.8 kg while performing a parabolic climb, steep descent, and rapid recovery. The gull inspired prototype by Grant et al. accurately mimics the elbow and wrist rotation of gulls, and they find that lift generation is maximized when the elbow and wrist deformations are opposite but equal.

Insect inspired BFRs typically take inspiration from beetles or dragonflies. An example of a beetle inspired BFR is the prototype by Phan and Park, and a dragonfly inspired BFR is the prototype by Hu et al. The flapping frequency of insect inspired BFRs are much higher than those of other BFRs; this is because of the aerodynamics of insect flight. Insect inspired BFRs are much smaller than those inspired by mammals or birds, so they are more suitable for dense environments. The prototype by Phan and Park took inspiration from the rhinoceros beetle, so it can successfully continue flight even after a collision by deforming its hindwings.

=== Biomimetic architecture ===
Living beings have adapted to a constantly changing environment during evolution through mutation, recombination, and selection. The core idea of the biomimetic philosophy is that nature&#x27;s inhabitants including animals, plants, and microbes have the most experience in solving problems and have already found the most appropriate ways to last on planet Earth. Similarly, biomimetic architecture seeks solutions for building sustainability present in nature. While nature serves as a model, there are few examples of biomimetic architecture that aim to be nature positive.

The 21st century has seen a ubiquitous waste of energy due to inefficient building designs, in addition to the over-utilization of energy during the operational phase of its life cycle. In parallel, recent advancements in fabrication techniques, computational imaging, and simulation tools have opened up new possibilities to mimic nature across different architectural scales. As a result, there has been a rapid growth in devising innovative design approaches and solutions to counter energy problems. Biomimetic architecture is one of these multi-disciplinary approaches to sustainable design that follows a set of principles rather than stylistic codes, going beyond using nature as inspiration for the aesthetic components of built form but instead seeking to use nature to solve problems of the building&#x27;s functioning and saving energy.

==== Characteristics ====
The term biomimetic architecture refers to the study and application of construction principles which are found in natural environments and species, and are translated into the design of sustainable solutions for architecture. Biomimetic architecture uses nature as a model, measure and mentor for providing architectural solutions across scales, which are inspired by natural organisms that have solved similar problems in nature. Using nature as a measure refers to using an ecological standard of measuring sustainability, and efficiency of man-made innovations, while the term mentor refers to learning from natural principles and using biology as an inspirational source.

Biomorphic architecture, also referred to as bio-decoration, on the other hand, refers to the use of formal and geometric elements found in nature, as a source of inspiration for aesthetic properties in designed architecture, and may not necessarily have non-physical, or economic functions. A historic example of biomorphic architecture dates back to Egyptian, Greek and Roman cultures, using tree and plant forms in the ornamentation of structural columns.

==== Procedures ====
Within biomimetic architecture, two basic procedures can be identified, namely, the bottom-up approach (biology push) and top-down approach (technology pull). The boundary between the two approaches is blurry with the possibility of transition between the two, depending on each individual case. Biomimetic architecture is typically carried out in interdisciplinary teams in which biologists and other natural scientists work in collaboration with engineers, material scientists, architects, designers, mathematicians and computer scientists.

In the bottom-up approach, the starting point is a new result from basic biological research promising for biomimetic implementation. For example, developing a biomimetic material system after the quantitative analysis of the mechanical, physical, and chemical properties of a biological system.

In the top-down approach, biomimetic innovations are sought for already existing developments that have been successfully established on the market. The cooperation focuses on the improvement or further development of an existing product.

==== Examples ====
Researchers studied the termite&#x27;s ability to maintain virtually constant temperature and humidity in their termite mounds in Africa despite outside temperatures that vary from . Researchers initially scanned a termite mound and created 3-D images of the mound structure, which revealed construction that could influence human building design. The Eastgate Centre, a mid-rise office complex in Harare, Zimbabwe, stays cool via a passive cooling architecture that uses only 10% of the energy of a conventional building of the same size.

Researchers in the Sapienza University of Rome were inspired by the natural ventilation in termite mounds and designed a double façade that significantly cuts down over lit areas in a building. Scientists have imitated the porous nature of mound walls by designing a facade with double panels that was able to reduce heat gained by radiation and increase heat loss by convection in cavity between the two panels. The overall cooling load on the building&#x27;s energy consumption was reduced by 15%.

A similar inspiration was drawn from the porous walls of termite mounds to design a naturally ventilated façade with a small ventilation gap. This design of façade is able to induce air flow due to the Venturi effect and continuously circulates rising air in the ventilation slot. Significant transfer of heat between the building&#x27;s external wall surface and the air flowing over it was observed. The design is coupled with greening of the façade. Green wall facilitates additional natural cooling via evaporation, respiration and transpiration in plants. The damp plant substrate further support the cooling effect.

Scientists in Shanghai University were able to replicate the complex microstructure of clay-made conduit network in the mound to mimic the excellent humidity control in mounds. They proposed a porous humidity control material (HCM) using sepiolite and calcium chloride with water vapor adsorption-desorption content at 550 grams per meter squared. Calcium chloride is a desiccant and improves the water vapor adsorption-desorption property of the Bio-HCM. The proposed bio-HCM has a regime of interfiber mesopores which acts as a mini reservoir. The flexural strength of the proposed material was estimated to be 10.3 MPa using computational simulations.

In structural engineering, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) has incorporated biomimetic characteristics in an adaptive deployable &quot;tensegrity&quot; bridge. The bridge can carry out self-diagnosis and self-repair. The arrangement of leaves on a plant has been adapted for better solar power collection.

Analysis of the elastic deformation happening when a pollinator lands on the sheath-like perch part of the flower &quot;Strelitzia reginae&quot; (known as bird-of-paradise flower) has inspired architects and scientists from the University of Freiburg and University of Stuttgart to create hingeless shading systems that can react to their environment. These bio-inspired products are sold under the name Flectofin.

Other hingeless bioinspired systems include Flectofold. Flectofold has been inspired from the trapping system developed by the carnivorous plant &quot;Aldrovanda vesiculosa&quot;.

=== Structural materials ===
There is a great need for new structural materials that are light weight but offer exceptional combinations of stiffness, strength, and toughness.

Such materials would need to be manufactured into bulk materials with complex shapes at high volume and low cost and would serve a variety of fields such as construction, transportation, energy storage and conversion. In a classic design problem, strength and toughness are more likely to be mutually exclusive, i.e., strong materials are brittle and tough materials are weak. However, natural materials with complex and hierarchical material gradients that span from nano- to macro-scales are both strong and tough. Generally, most natural materials utilize limited chemical components but complex material architectures that give rise to exceptional mechanical properties. Understanding the highly diverse and multi functional biological materials and discovering approaches to replicate such structures will lead to advanced and more efficient technologies. Bone, nacre (abalone shell), teeth, the dactyl clubs of stomatopod shrimps and bamboo are great examples of damage tolerant materials. The exceptional resistance to fracture of bone is due to complex deformation and toughening mechanisms that operate at spanning different size scales — nanoscale structure of protein molecules to macroscopic physiological scale. Nacre exhibits similar mechanical properties however with rather simpler structure. Nacre shows a brick and mortar like structure with thick mineral layer (0.2–0.9 μm) of closely packed aragonite structures and thin organic matrix (~20 nm). While thin films and micrometer sized samples that mimic these structures are already produced, successful production of bulk biomimetic structural materials is yet to be realized. However, numerous processing techniques have been proposed for producing nacre like materials. Pavement cells, epidermal cells on the surface of plant leaves and petals, often form wavy interlocking patterns resembling jigsaw puzzle pieces and are shown to enhance the fracture toughness of leaves, key to plant survival. Their pattern, replicated in laser-engraved Poly(methyl methacrylate) samples, was also demonstrated to lead to increased fracture toughness. It is suggested that the arrangement and patterning of cells play a role in managing crack propagation in tissues.

Biomorphic mineralization is a technique that produces materials with morphologies and structures resembling those of natural living organisms by using bio-structures as templates for mineralization. Compared to other methods of material production, biomorphic mineralization is facile, environmentally benign and economic.

Freeze casting (ice templating), an inexpensive method to mimic natural layered structures, was employed by researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to create alumina-Al-Si and IT HAP-epoxy layered composites that match the mechanical properties of bone with an equivalent mineral/organic content. Various further studies also employed similar methods to produce high strength and high toughness composites involving a variety of constituent phases.

Recent studies demonstrated production of cohesive and self supporting macroscopic tissue constructs that mimic living tissues by printing tens of thousands of heterologous picoliter droplets in software-defined, 3D millimeter-scale geometries. Efforts are also taken up to mimic the design of nacre in artificial composite materials using fused deposition modelling and the helicoidal structures of stomatopod clubs in the fabrication of high performance carbon fiber-epoxy composites.

Various established and novel additive manufacturing technologies like PolyJet printing, direct ink writing, 3D magnetic printing, multi-material magnetically assisted 3D printing and magnetically assisted slip casting have also been utilized to mimic the complex micro-scale architectures of natural materials and provide huge scope for future research.

Spider silk is tougher than Kevlar used in bulletproof vests. Engineers could in principle use such a material, if it could be reengineered to have a long enough life, for parachute lines, suspension bridge cables, artificial ligaments for medicine, and other purposes. The self-sharpening teeth of many animals have been copied to make better cutting tools.

New ceramics that exhibit giant electret hysteresis have also been realized.

=== Neuronal computers ===
Neuromorphic computers and sensors are electrical devices that copy the structure and function of biological neurons in order to compute. One example of this is the event camera in which only the
pixels that receive a new signal update to a new state. All other pixels do not update until a signal is received.

=== Self healing-materials ===
In some biological systems, self-healing occurs via chemical releases at the site of fracture, which initiate a systemic response to transport repairing agents to the fracture site. This promotes autonomic healing. To demonstrate the use of micro-vascular networks for autonomic healing, researchers developed a microvascular coating–substrate architecture that mimics human skin. Bio-inspired self-healing structural color hydrogels that maintain the stability of an inverse opal structure and its resultant structural colors were developed. A self-repairing membrane inspired by rapid self-sealing processes in plants was developed for inflatable lightweight structures such as rubber boats or Tensairity constructions. The researchers applied a thin soft cellular polyurethane foam coating on the inside of a fabric substrate, which closes the crack if the membrane is punctured with a spike. Self-healing materials, polymers and composite materials capable of mending cracks have been produced based on biological materials.

The self-healing properties may also be achieved by the breaking and reforming of hydrogen bonds upon cyclical stress of the material.

=== Surfaces ===
Surfaces that recreate the properties of shark skin are intended to enable more efficient movement through water. Efforts have been made to produce fabric that emulates shark skin.

Surface tension biomimetics are being researched for technologies such as hydrophobic or hydrophilic coatings and microactuators.

=== Adhesion ===

==== Wet adhesion ====
Some amphibians, such as tree and torrent frogs and arboreal salamanders, are able to attach to and move over wet or even flooded environments without falling. This kind of organisms have toe pads which are permanently wetted by mucus secreted from glands that open into the channels between epidermal cells. They attach to mating surfaces by wet adhesion and they are capable of climbing on wet rocks even when water is flowing over the surface. Tire treads have also been inspired by the toe pads of tree frogs. 3D printed hierarchical surface models, inspired from tree and torrent frogs toe pad design, have been observed to produce better wet traction than conventional tire design.

Marine mussels can stick easily and efficiently to surfaces underwater under the harsh conditions of the ocean. Mussels use strong filaments to adhere to rocks in the inter-tidal zones of wave-swept beaches, preventing them from being swept away in strong sea currents. Mussel foot proteins attach the filaments to rocks, boats and practically any surface in nature including other mussels. These proteins contain a mix of amino acid residues which has been adapted specifically for adhesive purposes. Researchers from the University of California Santa Barbara borrowed and simplified chemistries that the mussel foot uses to overcome this engineering challenge of wet adhesion to create copolyampholytes, and one-component adhesive systems with potential for employment in nanofabrication protocols. Other research has proposed adhesive glue from mussels.

==== Dry adhesion ====
Leg attachment pads of several animals, including many insects (e.g., beetles and flies), spiders and lizards (e.g., geckos), are capable of attaching to a variety of surfaces and are used for locomotion, even on vertical walls or across ceilings. Attachment systems in these organisms have similar structures at their terminal elements of contact, known as setae. Such biological examples have offered inspiration in order to produce climbing robots, boots and tape. Synthetic setae have also been developed for the production of dry adhesives.

=== Liquid repellency ===
Superliquiphobicity refers to a remarkable surface property where a solid surface exhibits an extreme aversion to liquids, causing droplets to bead up and roll off almost instantaneously upon contact. This behavior arises from intricate surface textures and interactions at the nanoscale, effectively preventing liquids from wetting or adhering to the surface. The term &quot;superliquiphobic&quot; is derived from &quot;superhydrophobic,&quot; which describes surfaces highly resistant to water. Superliquiphobic surfaces go beyond water repellency and display repellent characteristics towards a wide range of liquids, including those with very low surface tension or containing surfactants.

Superliquiphobicity emerges when a solid surface possesses minute roughness, forming interfaces with droplets through wetting while altering contact angles. This behavior hinges on the roughness factor (Rf), defining the ratio of solid-liquid area to its projection, influencing contact angles. On rough surfaces, non-wetting liquids give rise to composite solid-liquid-air interfaces, their contact angles determined by the distribution of wet and air-pocket areas. The achievement of superliquiphobicity involves increasing the fractional flat geometrical area (fLA) and Rf, leading to surfaces that actively repel liquids.

The inspiration for crafting such surfaces draws from nature&#x27;s ingenuity, illustrated by the &quot;lotus effect&quot;. Leaves of water-repellent plants, like the lotus, exhibit inherent hierarchical structures featuring nanoscale wax-coated formations. Other natural surfaces with these capabilities can include Beetle carapaces, and cacti spines, which may exhibit rough features at multiple size scales. These structures lead to superhydrophobicity, where water droplets perch on trapped air bubbles, resulting in high contact angles and minimal contact angle hysteresis. This natural example guides the development of superliquiphobic surfaces, capitalizing on re-entrant geometries that can repel low surface tension liquids and achieve near-zero contact angles.

Creating superliquiphobic surfaces involves pairing re-entrant geometries with low surface energy materials, such as fluorinated substances or liquid-like silocones. These geometries include overhangs that widen beneath the surface, enabling repellency even for minimal contact angles. These surfaces find utility in self-cleaning, anti-icing, anti-fogging, antifouling, enhanced condensation, and more, presenting innovative solutions to challenges in biomedicine, desalination, atmospheric water harvesting, and energy conversion.

In essence, superliquiphobicity, inspired by natural models like the lotus leaf, capitalizes on re-entrant geometries and surface properties to create interfaces that actively repel liquids. These surfaces hold immense promise across a range of applications, promising enhanced functionality and performance in various technological and industrial contexts.

=== Optics ===
Biomimetic materials are gaining increasing attention in the field of optics and photonics. There are still little known bioinspired or biomimetic products involving the photonic properties of plants or animals. However, understanding how nature designed such optical materials from biological resources is a current field of research.

==== Inspiration from fruits and plants ====
One source of biomimetic inspiration is from plants. Plants have proven to be concept generations for the following functions; re(action)-coupling, self (adaptability), self-repair, and energy-autonomy. As plants do not have a centralized decision making unit (i.e. a brain), most plants have a decentralized autonomous system in various organs and tissues of the plant. Therefore, they react to multiple stimulus such as light, heat, and humidity.

One example is the carnivorous plant species &quot;Dionaea muscipula&quot; (Venus flytrap). For the last 25 years, there has been research focus on the motion principles of the plant to develop AVFT (artificial Venus flytrap robots). Through the movement during prey capture, the plant inspired soft robotic motion systems. The fast snap buckling (within 100–300 ms) of the trap closure movement is initiated when prey triggers the hairs of the plant within a certain time (twice within 20 s). AVFT systems exist, in which the trap closure movements are actuated via magnetism, electricity, pressurized air, and temperature changes.

Another example of mimicking plants, is the &quot;Pollia condensata,&quot; also known as the marble berry. The chiral self-assembly of cellulose inspired by the &quot;Pollia condensata&quot; berry has been exploited to make optically active films. Such films are made from cellulose which is a biodegradable and biobased resource obtained from wood or cotton. The structural colours can potentially be everlasting and have more vibrant colour than the ones obtained from chemical absorption of light. &quot;Pollia condensata&quot; is not the only fruit showing a structural coloured skin; iridescence is also found in berries of other species such as &quot;Margaritaria nobilis&quot;. These fruits show iridescent colors in the blue-green region of the visible spectrum which gives the fruit a strong metallic and shiny visual appearance. The structural colours come from the organisation of cellulose chains in the fruit&#x27;s epicarp, a part of the fruit skin. Each cell of the epicarp is made of a multilayered envelope that behaves like a Bragg reflector. However, the light which is reflected from the skin of these fruits is not polarised unlike the one arising from man-made replicates obtained from the self-assembly of cellulose nanocrystals into helicoids, which only reflect left-handed circularly polarised light.

The fruit of &quot;Elaeocarpus angustifolius&quot; also show structural colour that come arises from the presence of specialised cells called iridosomes which have layered structures. Similar iridosomes have also been found in &quot;Delarbrea michieana&quot; fruits.

In plants, multi layer structures can be found either at the surface of the leaves (on top of the epidermis), such as in &quot;Selaginella willdenowii&quot; or within specialized intra-cellular organelles, the so-called iridoplasts, which are located inside the cells of the upper epidermis. For instance, the rain forest plants Begonia pavonina have iridoplasts located inside the epidermal cells.

Structural colours have also been found in several algae, such as in the red alga &quot;Chondrus crispus&quot; (Irish Moss).

==== Inspiration from animals ====
Structural coloration produces the rainbow colours of soap bubbles, butterfly wings and many beetle scales. Phase-separation has been used to fabricate ultra-white scattering membranes from polymethylmethacrylate, mimicking the beetle &quot;Cyphochilus&quot;. LED lights can be designed to mimic the patterns of scales on fireflies&#x27; abdomens, improving their efficiency.

&quot;Morpho&quot; butterfly wings are structurally coloured to produce a vibrant blue that does not vary with angle. This effect can be mimicked by a variety of technologies. Lotus Cars claim to have developed a paint that mimics the &quot;Morpho&quot; butterfly&#x27;s structural blue colour. In 2007, Qualcomm commercialised an interferometric modulator display technology, &quot;Mirasol&quot;, using &quot;Morpho&quot;-like optical interference. In 2010, the dressmaker Donna Sgro made a dress from Teijin Fibers&#x27; Morphotex, an undyed fabric woven from structurally coloured fibres, mimicking the microstructure of &quot;Morpho&quot; butterfly wing scales.

Canon Inc.&#x27;s SubWavelength structure Coating uses wedge-shaped structures the size of the wavelength of visible light. The wedge-shaped structures cause a continuously changing refractive index as light travels through the coating, significantly reducing lens flare. This imitates the structure of a moth&#x27;s eye. Notable figures such as the Wright Brothers and Leonardo da Vinci attempted to replicate the flight observed in birds. In an effort to reduce aircraft noise researchers have looked to the leading edge of owl feathers, which have an array of small finlets or rachis adapted to disperse aerodynamic pressure and provide nearly silent flight to the bird.

=== Agricultural systems ===
Holistic planned grazing, using fencing and/or herders, seeks to restore grasslands by carefully planning movements of large herds of livestock to mimic the vast herds found in nature. The natural system being mimicked and used as a template is grazing animals concentrated by pack predators that must move on after eating, trampling, and manuring an area, and returning only after it has fully recovered. Its founder Allan Savory and some others have claimed potential in building soil, increasing biodiversity, and reversing desertification. However, many researchers have disputed Savory&#x27;s claim. Studies have often found that the method increases desertification instead of reducing it.

===Other uses===

Some air conditioning systems use biomimicry in their fans to increase airflow while reducing power consumption.

Technologists like Jas Johl have speculated that the functionality of vacuole cells could be used to design highly adaptable security systems. &quot;The functionality of a vacuole, a biological structure that guards and promotes growth, illuminates the value of adaptability as a guiding principle for security.&quot; The functions and significance of vacuoles are fractal in nature, the organelle has no basic shape or size; its structure varies according to the requirements of the cell. Vacuoles not only isolate threats, contain what&#x27;s necessary, export waste, maintain pressure—they also help the cell scale and grow. Johl argues these functions are necessary for any security system design. The 500 Series Shinkansen used biomimicry to reduce energy consumption and noise levels while increasing passenger comfort. With reference to space travel, NASA and other firms have sought to develop swarm-type space drones inspired by bee behavioural patterns, and oxtapod terrestrial drones designed with reference to desert spiders.

==Other technologies==

Protein folding has been used to control material formation for self-assembled functional nanostructures. Polar bear fur has inspired the design of thermal collectors and clothing. The light refractive properties of the moth&#x27;s eye has been studied to reduce the reflectivity of solar panels.

The Bombardier beetle&#x27;s powerful repellent spray inspired a Swedish company to develop a &quot;micro mist&quot; spray technology, which is claimed to have a low carbon impact (compared to aerosol sprays). The beetle mixes chemicals and releases its spray via a steerable nozzle at the end of its abdomen, stinging and confusing the victim.

Most viruses have an outer capsule 20 to 300 nm in diameter. Virus capsules are remarkably robust and capable of withstanding temperatures as high as 60 °C; they are stable across the pH range 2–10. Viral capsules can be used to create nano device components such as nanowires, nanotubes, and quantum dots. Tubular virus particles such as the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) can be used as templates to create nanofibers and nanotubes, since both the inner and outer layers of the virus are charged surfaces which can induce nucleation of crystal growth. This was demonstrated through the production of platinum and gold nanotubes using TMV as a template. Mineralized virus particles have been shown to withstand various pH values by mineralizing the viruses with different materials such as silicon, PbS, and CdS and could therefore serve as a useful carriers of material. A spherical plant virus called cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) has interesting expanding properties when exposed to environments of pH higher than 6.5. Above this pH, 60 independent pores with diameters about 2 nm begin to exchange substance with the environment. The structural transition of the viral capsid can be utilized in Biomorphic mineralization for selective uptake and deposition of minerals by controlling the solution pH. Possible applications include using the viral cage to produce uniformly shaped and sized quantum dot semiconductor nanoparticles through a series of pH washes. This is an alternative to the apoferritin cage technique currently used to synthesize uniform CdSe nanoparticles. Such materials could also be used for targeted drug delivery since particles release contents upon exposure to specific pH levels.

<text>Janet Gaynor (born Laura Augusta Gainor; October 6, 1906 – September 14, 1984) was an American actress. She began her career as an extra in shorts and silent films. After signing with Fox Film Corporation (later 20th Century-Fox) in 1926, she rose to fame and became one of the biggest box office draws of the era. In 1929, she became the first recipient of the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performances in &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, &quot;&quot; (both 1927) and &quot;Street Angel&quot; (1928), the only occasion an actress won one Oscar for multiple film roles. Her success continued into the sound film era; for &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1937), she received a second Best Actress Academy Award nomination.

After retiring from acting in 1939, Gaynor married film costume designer Adrian, with whom she had a son. She briefly returned to acting in films and television in the 1950s and later became an accomplished oil painter. In 1980, Gaynor made her Broadway debut in the stage adaptation of the 1971 film &quot;Harold and Maude,&quot; and appeared in the touring theatrical production of &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; in February 1982.

In 1982, Gaynor was severely injured when a drunken driver struck the taxicab in which she and two others were passengers. Two years later, on September 14, 1984, she died of health issues stemming from the injuries sustained in the accident.

==Early life==
Gaynor was born Laura Augusta Gainor (some sources stated Gainer) in Germantown, Philadelphia. Nicknamed &quot;Lolly&quot; as a child, she was the younger of two daughters born to Laura (Buhl) and Frank De Witt Gainor. Frank Gainor worked as a theatrical painter and paperhanger. When Gaynor was a toddler, her father began teaching her how to sing, dance, and perform acrobatics. As a child in Philadelphia, she began acting in school plays. After her parents divorced in 1914, Gaynor, her sister, and her mother moved to Chicago. Shortly thereafter, her mother married electrician Harry C. Jones. The family later moved to San Francisco.

After graduating from San Francisco Polytechnic High School in 1923, Gaynor spent the winter in Melbourne, Florida, where she did stage work. Upon returning to San Francisco, Gaynor, her mother, and stepfather moved to Los Angeles, where she could pursue an acting career. She was initially hesitant to do so and enrolled at Hollywood Secretarial School. She supported herself by working in a shoe store and later as a theatre usher. Her mother and stepfather continued to encourage her to become an actress and she began making the rounds to the studios (accompanied by her stepfather) to find film work.

Gaynor won her first professional acting job on December 26, 1924, as an extra in a Hal Roach comedy short. This led to more extra work in feature films and shorts for Film Booking Offices of America and Universal. Universal eventually hired her as a stock player for $50 a week. Six weeks after being hired by Universal, an executive at Fox Film Corporation offered her a screen test for a supporting role in the film &quot;The Johnstown Flood&quot; (1926). Her performance in the film caught the attention of Fox executives, who signed her to a five-year contract and began to cast her in leading roles.
Later that year, Gaynor was selected as one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars (along with Joan Crawford, Dolores del Río, Mary Astor, and others).

==Career==
By 1927, Gaynor was one of Hollywood&#x27;s leading ladies. Her image was that of a sweet, wholesome and pure young woman, who was notable for playing her roles with depth and sensitivity. Her performances in &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, the first of 12 films she would make with actor Charles Farrell; &quot;&quot;, directed by F. W. Murnau; and &quot;Street Angel&quot;, also with Charles Farrell, earned her the first Academy Award for Best Actress in 1929, when for the first and only time the award was granted for multiple roles, on the basis of total recent work rather than for one particular performance. This practice was prohibited three years later by a new Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences rule. Gaynor was not only the first actress to win the award, but at 22, was the youngest until 1986, when actress Marlee Matlin, 21, won for her role in &quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot;.

Gaynor was one of only a handful of established lead actresses who made a successful transition to sound films. In 1929, she was re-teamed with Charles Farrell (the pair was known as &quot;America&#x27;s favorite love birds&quot;) for the musical film &quot;Sunny Side Up&quot;.
During the early 1930s, Gaynor was one of Fox&#x27;s most popular actresses and one of Hollywood&#x27;s biggest box-office draws. In 1931 and 1932, she and Marie Dressler were tied as the number-one draw at the box office. After Dressler&#x27;s death in 1934, Gaynor held the top spot alone. She often was cited as a successor to Mary Pickford, and was cast in remakes of two Pickford films: &quot;Daddy Long Legs&quot; (1931) and &quot;Tess of the Storm Country&quot; (1932). Gaynor drew the line at a proposed remake of &quot;Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm&quot;, which she considered &quot;too juvenile&quot;.

Gaynor continued to garner top billing for roles in &quot;State Fair&quot; (1933) with Will Rogers and &quot;The Farmer Takes a Wife&quot; (1935), which introduced Henry Fonda to the screen as Gaynor&#x27;s leading man. However, when Darryl F. Zanuck merged his fledgling studio, Twentieth Century Pictures, with Fox Film Corporation to form 20th Century-Fox, her status became precarious, and even tertiary to those of burgeoning actresses Loretta Young and Shirley Temple. According to press reports at the time, Gaynor held out on signing with 20th Century-Fox until her salary was raised from $1,000 per week to $3,000. The studio quickly issued a statement denying that Gaynor was holding out for more money. She quietly signed a new contract, the terms of which were never made public.

Gaynor received top billing above Constance Bennett, Loretta Young, and Tyrone Power in &quot;Ladies in Love&quot; (1937), but her box-office appeal had begun to wane: Once ranked number one, she had dropped to number 24. She considered retiring due to her frustration with studio executives, who continued to cast her in the same type of role that brought her fame, while audiences&#x27; tastes were changing. After 20th Century-Fox executives proposed that her contract be re-negotiated, and that she be demoted to featured player status, Gaynor left the studio, but her retirement plans were quashed when David O. Selznick offered her the leading role in a new film to be produced by his company, Selznick International Pictures. Selznick, who was friendly with Gaynor off-screen, was convinced that audiences would enjoy seeing her portray a character closer to her true personality. He believed that she possessed the perfect combination of humor, charm, vulnerability, and innocence for the role of aspiring actress Esther Blodgett (later Vicki Lester) in &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;. Gaynor accepted the role. The romantic drama was filmed in Technicolor, and co-starred Fredric March. Released in 1937, it was an enormous hit, and earned Gaynor her second Academy Award nomination for Best Actress; she lost to Luise Rainer for &quot;The Good Earth&quot;.

&quot;A Star Is Born&quot; revitalized Gaynor&#x27;s career, and she was cast in the screwball comedy &quot;The Young in Heart&quot; (1938) with Paulette Goddard. That film was a modest hit, but by then, Gaynor had definitely decided to retire. She later explained: &quot;I had been working steadily for 17 long years; making movies was really all I knew of life. I just wanted to have time to know other things. Most of all, I wanted to fall in love. I wanted to get married. I wanted a child. And I knew that in order to have these things, one had to make time for them. So, I simply stopped making movies. Then, as if by a miracle, everything I really wanted happened.&quot; At the top of the industry, she retired at age 33.

==Later years==

In August 1939, Gaynor married Hollywood costume designer Adrian, with whom she had a son in 1940. The couple divided their time between their 250-acre cattle ranch in Anápolis, Brazil, and their homes in New York and California. Both were also heavily involved in the fashion and arts community. Gaynor returned to acting in the early 1950s with appearances in live television series, including &quot;Medallion Theatre&quot;, &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;, and &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;. In 1957, she appeared in her final film role as Dick Sargent&#x27;s mother in the musical comedy &quot;Bernardine&quot;, starring Pat Boone and Terry Moore. In November 1959, she made her stage debut in the play &quot;The Midnight Sun&quot; in New Haven, Connecticut. The play, which Gaynor later called &quot;a disaster&quot;, was not well received and closed shortly after its debut.

Gaynor also became an accomplished oil painter of vegetable and flower still lifes. She sold over 200 paintings and had four showings under the Wally Findlay Galleries banner in New York, Chicago, and Palm Beach from 1975 to February 1982.

In 1980, Gaynor made her Broadway debut as Maude in the stage adaptation of the 1971 film &quot;Harold and Maude&quot;. She received good reviews for her performance, but the play was panned by critics and closed after 21 performances. Later that year, she reunited with her &quot;Servants&#x27; Entrance&quot; co-star Lew Ayres to film an episode of the anthology series &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. It was the first television appearance Gaynor had made since the 1950s and was her last screen role. In February 1982, she starred in the touring production of &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;. This was her final acting role.

==Personal life==

===Marriages and relationships===

Gaynor was romantically involved with her friend and frequent co-star Charles Farrell during their work together in silent films until she married her first husband. Choosing to keep their relationship out of the public eye, Gaynor and Farrell were often assisted by a mutual friend Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in maintaining the ruse. Looking back, Fairbanks would later recall, &quot;We three were so chummy that I became their &#x27;beard,&#x27; the cover-up for their secret romance. I would drive them out to a little rundown, wooden house well south of Los Angeles, near the sea. I&#x27;d leave them there and go sailing or swimming until [it was] time to collect them and then we&#x27;d all have a bit of dinner.&quot;

According to Gaynor&#x27;s biographer Sarah Baker, Farrell proposed marriage during the filming of &quot;Lucky Star&quot;, but the two never followed through with it. In her later years, Gaynor would hold their different personalities accountable for their eventual separation.

Gaynor was married three times and had one child. Her first marriage was to lawyer Jesse Lydell Peck, whom she married on September 11, 1929. Gaynor&#x27;s attorney announced the couple&#x27;s separation in late December 1932. She was granted a divorce on April 7, 1933. On August 14, 1939, she married MGM costume designer Adrian in Yuma, Arizona. This relationship has been called a lavender marriage because Adrian was openly gay within the film community, and Gaynor herself was rumored to be bisexual. The couple had one son, Robin Gaynor Adrian, born in 1940. Gaynor and Adrian remained married until Adrian&#x27;s death from a stroke on September 13, 1959.

On December 24, 1964, Gaynor married her longtime friend, stage producer Paul Gregory, to whom she remained married until her death. The two maintained a home in Desert Hot Springs, California and owned 3,000 acres of land in Brazil, situated near Brasília.

===Friendship with Margaret Lindsay===
Margaret Lindsay and Gaynor appeared together in the film &quot;Paddy the Next Best Thing&quot; (1933). Lindsay and Gaynor often vacationed together for the next several years.&lt;ref name=&quot;bridgemanimages/5802923&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;queen.spaceports/Lindsay&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friendship with Mary Martin===
Gaynor and her husband traveled frequently with her close friend Mary Martin and her husband. A Brazilian press report noted that Gaynor and Martin briefly lived with their respective husbands in Anápolis, state of Goiás at a ranch (&quot;fazenda&quot; in Portuguese) in the 1950s and 1960s. Both houses remain intact as of 2021. There is a project by the Jan Magalinski Institute to restore their houses to create a Cinema Museum of Goiás.

==Car wreck and eventual death==


On the evening of September 5, 1982, Gaynor, her husband Paul Gregory, actress Mary Martin, and Martin&#x27;s manager Ben Washer, en route to a Chinatown restaurant,&lt;ref name=&quot;cdnc/DS19821215.2.36&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; were involved in a serious car wreck in San Francisco. A van ran a red light at the corner of California and Franklin Streets and crashed into the Luxor taxicab in which the group was riding, knocking it into a tree. Ben Washer was killed, Mary Martin sustained two broken ribs and a broken pelvis, and Gaynor&#x27;s husband suffered two broken legs. Gaynor sustained several serious injuries, including 11 broken ribs, a fractured collarbone, pelvic fractures, a punctured lung, and injuries to her bladder and kidney. Robert Cato, the driver of the van, was arrested on two counts of felony drunk driving, reckless driving, speeding, running a red light, and vehicular homicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo/1982/09/07/martin-gaynor-hurt-traffic&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Cato, a former policeman, in the previous year, was charged with two felonies for using his car as a deadly weapon against a woman motorist, Mellicent Wauters, a dental assistant and amateur actress,&lt;ref name=&quot;ebay/204315878614&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he&#x27;d argued over a parking spot.&lt;ref name=&quot;upi/4923400305600&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Cato had been placed on informal probation; subsequently, the charges had been dropped.&lt;ref name=&quot;upi/6094400478400/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Cato pleaded not guilty and was later released on $10,000 ($ today) bail. On March 15, 1983, he was found guilty of drunk driving and vehicular homicide and was sentenced to three years in prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;newspapers.com/56532302&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of her injuries, Gaynor was hospitalized for four months and underwent two surgeries to repair a perforated bladder and internal bleeding. She recovered sufficiently to return to her home in Desert Hot Springs, but continued to experience health issues due to the injuries and required frequent hospitalizations. Shortly before her death, she was hospitalized for pneumonia and other ailments. On September 14, 1984, Gaynor died at Desert Hospital in Palm Springs at the age of 77. Her doctor, Bart Apfelbaum, attributed her death to the 1982 car wreck and stated that Gaynor &quot;never recovered&quot; from her injuries. In September 1984, these injuries were officially ruled to have caused her death.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/coroner-rules-death-result-82-accident&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaynor is buried at Hollywood Forever Cemetery next to her second husband, Adrian. Her headstone reads &quot;Janet Gaynor Gregory&quot;, her legal name after her marriage to her third husband, producer and director Paul Gregory.

==Honors==
In 1929, at 23 years old, Gaynor won the first Academy Award for Best Actress.

For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Gaynor has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6284 Hollywood Blvd.

On March 1, 1978, Howard W. Koch, then the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, presented Gaynor with a citation for her &quot;truly immeasurable contribution to the art of motion pictures&quot;.

In 1979, Gaynor was awarded the Order of the Southern Cross for her cultural contributions to Brazil.

<doc id="45795" wikidata="Q1540268" url="?curid=45795" title="Natural capital">
<text>Natural capital is the world&#x27;s stock of natural resources, which includes geology, soils, air, water and all living organisms. Some natural capital assets provide people with free goods and services, often called ecosystem services. All of these underpin our economy and society, and thus make human life possible.

It is an extension of the economic notion of capital (resources which enable the production of more resources) to goods and services provided by the natural environment. For example, a well-maintained forest or river may provide an indefinitely sustainable flow of new trees or fish, whereas over-use of those resources may lead to a permanent decline in timber availability or fish stocks. Natural capital also provides people with essential services, like water catchment, erosion control and crop pollination by insects, which in turn ensure the long-term viability of other natural resources. Since the continuous supply of services from the available natural capital assets is dependent upon a healthy, functioning environment, the structure and diversity of habitats and ecosystems are important components of natural capital. Methods, called &#x27;natural capital asset checks&#x27;, help decision-makers understand how changes in the current and future performance of natural capital assets will impact human well-being and the economy. Unpriced natural capital is what we refer to when businesses or individuals exploit or abuse nature without being held accountable, which can harm ecosystems and the environment. 

== History of the concept ==

The term &#x27;natural capital&#x27; was first used in 1973 by E. F. Schumacher in his book &quot;Small Is Beautiful&quot; and was developed further by Herman Daly, Robert Costanza, and other founders of the science of Ecological Economics, as part of a comprehensive critique of the shortcomings of conventional economics. Natural capital is a concept central to economic assessment ecosystem services valuation which revolves around the idea, that non-human life produces goods and services that are essential to life. Thus, natural capital is essential to the sustainability of the economy.

In a traditional economic analysis of the factors of production, natural capital would usually be classified as &quot;land&quot; distinct from traditional &quot;capital&quot;. The historical distinction between &quot;land&quot; and &quot;capital&quot; defined &quot;land&quot; as naturally occurring with a fixed supply, whereas &quot;capital&quot;, as originally defined referred only to man-made goods. (e.g., Georgism) It is, however, misleading to view &quot;land&quot; as if its productive capacity is fixed, because natural capital can be improved or degraded by the actions of man over time (see Environmental degradation). Moreover, natural capital yields benefits and goods, such as timber or food, which can be harvested by humans. These benefits are similar to those realized by owners of infrastructural capital which yields more goods, such as a factory that produces automobiles just as an apple tree produces apples.

Ecologists are teaming up with economists to measure and express values of the wealth of ecosystems as a way of finding solutions to the biodiversity crisis. Some researchers have attempted to place a dollar figure on ecosystem services such as the value that the Canadian boreal forest&#x27;s contribution to global ecosystem services. If ecologically intact, the boreal forest has an estimated value of US$3.7 trillion. The boreal forest ecosystem is one of the planet&#x27;s great atmospheric regulators and it stores more carbon than any other biome on the planet. The annual value for ecological services of the Boreal Forest is estimated at US$93.2 billion, or 2.5 greater than the annual value of resource extraction.

The economic value of 17 ecosystem services for the entire biosphere (calculated in 1997) has an estimated average value of US$33 trillion per year. These ecological economic values are not currently included in calculations of national income accounts, the GDP and they have no price attributes because they exist mostly outside of the global markets. The loss of natural capital continues to accelerate and goes undetected or ignored by mainstream monetary analysis.

Within the international community the basic principle is not controversial, although much uncertainty exists over how best to value different aspects of ecological health, natural capital and ecosystem services. Full-cost accounting, triple bottom line, measuring well-being and other proposals for accounting reform often include suggestions to measure an &quot;ecological deficit&quot; or &quot;natural deficit&quot; alongside a social and financial deficit. It is difficult to measure such a deficit without some agreement on methods of valuation and auditing of at least the global forms of natural capital (e.g. value of air, water, soil).

All uses of the term currently differentiate natural from man-made or infrastructural capital in some way. Indicators adopted by United Nations Environment Programme&#x27;s World Conservation Monitoring Centre and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to measure natural biodiversity use the term in a slightly more specific way. According to the OECD, natural capital is &quot;natural assets in their role of providing natural resource inputs and environmental services for economic production&quot; and is &quot;generally considered to comprise three principal categories: natural resources stocks, land, and ecosystems.&quot;

The concept of &quot;natural capital&quot; has also been used by the Biosphere 2 project, and the Natural Capitalism economic model of Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins, and Hunter Lovins. Recently, it has begun to be used by politicians, notably Ralph Nader, Paul Martin Jr., and agencies of the UK government, including its Natural Capital Committee and the London Health Observatory.

In &quot;Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution&quot; the author claims that the &quot;next industrial revolution&quot; depends on the espousal of four central strategies: &quot;the conservation of resources through more effective manufacturing processes, the reuse of materials as found in natural systems, a change in values from quantity to quality, and investing in natural capital, or restoring and sustaining natural resources.&quot;

== Natural capital declaration ==
In June 2012 a &#x27;natural capital declaration&#x27; (NCD) was launched at the Rio+20 summit held in Brazil. An initiative of the global finance sector, it was signed by 40 CEOs to &#x27;integrate natural capital considerations into loans, equity, fixed income and insurance products, as well as in accounting, disclosure and reporting frameworks.&#x27; They worked with supporting organisations to develop tools and metrics to integrate natural capital factors into existing business structures.

In summary, its four key aims are to:

*Increase understanding of business dependency on natural capital assets;
*Support development of tools to integrate natural capital considerations into the decision-making process of all financial products and services;
*Help build a global consensus on integrating natural capital into private sector accounting and decision-making;
*Encourage a consensus on integrated reporting to include natural capital as one of the key components of an organisation&#x27;s success.

== Natural Capital Protocol ==
In July 2016, the Natural Capital Coalition (now known as Capitals Coalition) released the Natural Capital Protocol. The Protocol provides a standardised framework for organisations to identify, measure and value their direct and indirect impacts and dependencies on natural capital. The Protocol harmonises existing tools and methodologies, and guides organisations towards the information they need to make strategic and operational decisions that include impacts and dependencies on natural capital.

The Protocol was developed in a unique collaboration between 38 organisations who signed voluntary, pre-competitive contracts. This collaboration was led by Mark Gough, who is now the CEO of the Capitals Coalition.

The Protocol is available on a creative commons license and is free for organisations to apply.

== Internationally agreed standard ==
Environmental-economic accounts provide the conceptual framework for integrated statistics on the environment and its relationship with the economy, including the impacts of the economy on the environment and the contribution of the environment to the economy. A coherent set of indicators and descriptive statistics can be derived from the accounts that inform a wide range of policies.

These include, but are not limited to:

* Green economy/green growth
* Natural resource management
* Sustainable development

The System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA) contains the internationally agreed standard concepts, definitions, classifications, accounting rules and tables for producing internationally comparable statistics on the environment and its relationship with the economy. The SEEA is a flexible system in the sense that its implementation can be adapted to countries&#x27; specific situations and priorities. Coordination of the implementation of the SEEA and ongoing work on new methodological developments is managed and supervised by the UN Committee of Experts on Environmental-Economic Accounting (UNCEEA). The final, official version of the SEEA Central Framework was published in February 2014.

In March 2021, the United Nations Statistical Commission adopted the SEEA Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA EA) standard at its 52nd session. The SEEA EA is a statistical framework that provides a coherent accounting approach to the measurement of ecosystems. Ecosystem accounts enable the presentation of data and indicators of ecosystem extent, ecosystem condition, and ecosystem services in both physical and monetary terms in a spatially explicit way. Following its adoption, the Statistics Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) in collaboration with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3) released the ARIES for SEEA Explorer in April 2021, an artificial intelligence-powered tool based on the Artificial Intelligence for Environment and Sustainability (ARIES) platform for rapid, standardized and customizable natural capital accounting. The ARIES for SEEA Explorer was made available on the UN Global Platform in order to accelerate SEEA&#x27;s implementation worldwide.

== Private sector approaches ==
Some studies envisage a private sector natural capital &#x27;ecosystem&#x27;, including investors, assets and regulators. 

== Criticism ==
Whilst measuring the components of natural capital in any region is a relatively straightforward process, both the task and the rationale of putting a monetary valuation on them, or on the value of the goods and services they freely give us, has proved more contentious.
Within the UK, &quot;Guardian&quot; columnist, George Monbiot, has been critical of the work of the government&#x27;s Natural Capital Committee and of other attempts to place any sort of monetary value on natural capital assets, or on the free ecosystem services they provide us with. In a speech referring to a report to government which suggested that better protection of the UK&#x27;s freshwater ecosystems would yield an enhancement in aesthetic value of £700m, he derided attempts &#x27;to compare things which cannot be directly compared&#x27;. He went on to say:
Others have defended efforts to integrate the valuation of natural capital into local and national economic decision-making, arguing that it puts the environment on a more balanced footing when weighed against other commercial pressures, and that &#x27;valuation&#x27; of those assets is not the same as monetisation.

<doc id="45798" wikidata="Q36135" url="?curid=45798" title="Clouded leopard">
<text>The clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), also called mainland clouded leopard, is a wild cat inhabiting dense forests from the foothills of the Himalayas through Northeast India and Bhutan to mainland Southeast Asia into South China. It was first described in 1821 on the basis of a skin of an individual from China. The clouded leopard has large dusky-grey blotches and irregular spots and stripes reminiscent of clouds. Its head-and-body length ranges from with a long tail. It uses its tail for balancing when moving in trees and is able to climb down vertical tree trunks head first. It rests in trees during the day and hunts by night on the forest floor.

The clouded leopard is the sister taxon to other pantherine cats, having genetically diverged 9.32 to 4.47 million years ago. Today, the clouded leopard is locally extinct in Singapore, Taiwan, and possibly also in Hainan Island and Vietnam. The wild population is believed to be in decline with fewer than 10,000 adults and no more than 1,000 in each subpopulation. It has therefore been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 2008. The population is threatened by large–scale deforestation and commercial poaching for the wildlife trade. Its body parts are offered for decoration and clothing, though it is legally protected in most range countries.

The clouded leopard has been kept in zoological gardens since the early 20th century. Captive breeding programs were initiated in the 1980s. In captivity, the clouded leopard has an average lifespan of 11 years.

== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==
&quot;Felis nebulosa&quot; was proposed by Edward Griffith in 1821 who first described a skin of a clouded leopard that was brought alive from Guangdong in China to the menagerie at Exeter Exchange in London.
&quot;Felis macrosceloides&quot; proposed by Brian Houghton Hodgson in 1841 was a clouded leopard specimen from Nepal.
&quot;Felis brachyura&quot; proposed by Robert Swinhoe in 1862 was a clouded leopard skin from Taiwan.
The generic name &quot;Neofelis&quot; was proposed by John Edward Gray in 1867 who subordinated all three to this genus.
At present, &quot;N. nebulosa&quot; is considered a monotypic species due to lack of evidence for subspeciation.

&quot;Felis diardi&quot; proposed by Georges Cuvier in 1823 was based on a clouded leopard skin from Java.
It was considered a clouded leopard subspecies by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1917. In 2006, it was identified as a distinct &quot;Neofelis&quot; species, the Sunda clouded leopard. Populations in Taiwan and Hainan Island are considered to belong to the mainland clouded leopard.

=== Phylogeny ===
Skulls of clouded leopard and &quot;Panthera&quot; species were analysed morphologically in the 1960s. Results indicate that the clouded leopard forms an evolutionary link between the Pantherinae and the Felinae.
Phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear DNA in tissue samples from all Felidae species revealed that the evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in the Miocene around in Asia. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at .
The clouded leopard is the sister taxon to all other members of the Pantherinae, diverging , based on analysis of their nuclear DNA.
The clouded leopard from mainland Asia reached Borneo and Sumatra via a now submerged land bridge probably during the Pleistocene, when populations became isolated during periods of global cooling and warming. Genetic analysis of hair samples of the clouded leopard and its sister species the Sunda clouded leopard (&quot;N. diardi&quot;) indicates that they diverged 2.0–0.93 million years ago.


== Characteristics ==

The clouded leopard&#x27;s fur is of a dark grey or ochreous ground-color, often largely obliterated by black and dark dusky-grey blotched pattern. There are black spots on the head, and the ears are black. Partly fused or broken-up stripes run from the corner of the eyes over the cheek, from the corner of the mouth to the neck, and along the nape to the shoulders. Elongated blotches continue down the spine and form a single median stripe on the loins. Two large blotches of dark dusky-grey hair on the side of the shoulders are each emphasized posteriorly by a dark stripe, which passes on to the foreleg and breaks up into irregular spots. The flanks are marked by dark dusky-grey irregular blotches bordered behind by long, oblique, irregularly curved or looped stripes. These blotches yielding the clouded pattern suggest the English name of the cat. The underparts and legs are spotted, and the tail is marked by large, irregular, paired spots. Its legs are short and stout, and paws broad. Females are slightly smaller than males.

Its hyoid bone is ossified, making it possible to purr. Its pupils contract into vertical slits. Irises are brownish yellow to grayish green. Melanistic clouded leopards are uncommon. It has rather short limbs compared to the other big cats. Its hind limbs are longer than its front limbs to allow for increased jumping and leaping capabilities. Its ulnae and radii are not fused, which also contributes to a greater range of motion when climbing trees and stalking prey. Clouded leopards weigh between . Females vary in head-to-body length from , with a tail long. Males are larger at with a tail long. 
Its shoulder height varies from .

Its skull is long and low with strong occipital and sagittal crests. The canine teeth are exceptionally long, the upper being about three times as long as the basal width of the socket. The first premolar is usually absent. The upper pair of canines measure or longer.
It has a bite force at the canine tip of 544.3 Newton and a bite force quotient at the canine tip of 122.4.
The clouded leopard is often referred to as a &quot;modern-day sabre-tooth&quot; because it has the largest canines in proportion to its body size.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The clouded leopard occurs from the Himalayan foothills in Nepal, Bhutan and India to Myanmar, southeastern Bangladesh, Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia and to south of the Yangtze River in China. It is locally extinct in Singapore and Taiwan.

Clouded leopards were found in Nepal in 1987 and 1988, having previously been presumed to be extinct in the country. Since then, the clouded leopard has been recorded in Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park and in Annapurna Conservation Area. Between 2014 and 2015, it was also recorded in Langtang National Park at an elevation range of .

In India, it occurs in the states of Sikkim, northern West Bengal, Tripura, Mizoram, Manipur, Assam, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh, as well as in the Meghalaya subtropical forests. In Pakke Tiger Reserve, a clouded leopard was photographed in semi-evergreen forest at an elevation of . In Sikkim, clouded leopards were photographed by camera traps at elevations of between April 2008 and May 2010 in the Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve. In Manas National Park, 16 individuals were recorded during a survey in November 2010 to February 2011. Between January 2013 and March 2018, clouded leopards were also recorded in Dampa Tiger Reserve, Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary and Singchung-Bugun Village Community Reserve, in Meghalaya&#x27;s Nongkhyllem National Park and Balpakram-Baghmara landscape.

In Bhutan, it was recorded in Royal Manas National Park, Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park, Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary, Jigme Dorji National Park, Phrumsengla National Park, Bumdeling Wildlife Sanctuary and several non-protected areas. In Bangladesh, it was recorded in Sangu Matamuhari in the Chittagong Hill Tracts in 2016. In Myanmar, it was recorded by camera traps for the first time in the hill forests of Karen State in 2015.

In Thailand, it inhabits relatively open, dry tropical forest in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and closed-forest habitats in Khao Yai National Park. In Laos, it was recorded in Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area in dry evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. In Cambodia, it was recorded in deciduous dipterocarp forest in Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary between 2008 and 2009, and in Central Cardamom Mountains National Park, Southern Cardamom National Park, Botum Sakor National Park and Phnom Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary between 2012 and 2016. In Peninsular Malaysia, it was recorded in Taman Negara National Park, Ulu Muda Forest, Pasoh Forest Reserve, Belum-Temengor, Temengor Forest Reserve and in a few linkages between 2009 and 2015.

The last confirmed record of a Formosan clouded leopard dates to 1989, when the skin of a young individual was found in the Taroko National Park. It was not recorded during an extensive camera trapping survey conducted from 1997 to 2012 in more than 1,450 sites inside and outside Taiwanese protected areas.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

The clouded leopard is a solitary cat. Early accounts depict it as a rare, secretive, arboreal, and nocturnal inhabitant of dense primary forest.

It is one of the most talented climbers among the cats. Captive clouded leopards have been observed to climb down vertical tree trunks head first, and hang on to branches with their hind paws bent around branchings of tree limbs. They are capable of supination and can hang down from branches only by bending their hind paws and their tail around them. They can jump up to high.
They use trees as daytime rest sites, but also spend time on the ground when hunting at night. Captive clouded leopards have been observed to scent mark by spraying urine and rubbing their heads on prominent objects.
Their vocalisations include a short high-pitched meow call, a loud crying call, both emitted when a cat is trying to locate another one over a long or short distance; they prusten and raise their muzzle when meeting each other in a friendly manner; when aggressive, they growl with a low-pitched sound and hiss with exposed teeth and wrinkled nose.

Radio-collared clouded leopards were foremost active by night but also showed crepuscular activity peaks.
Clouded leopards recorded in northeast India were most active in the late evening after sunset.

Home ranges have only been estimated in Thailand:
*Four individuals were radio-collared in Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary from April 2000 to February 2003. Home ranges of two females were and , and of two males and .
*Two individuals were radio-collared during a study from 1997 to 1999 in the Khao Yai National Park. The home range of one female was , of the one male . Both individuals had a core area of .
In 2016, clouded leopards were detected in the forest complex of Khlong Saeng Wildlife Sanctuary and Khao Sok National Park during camera trapping surveys; 15 individuals were identified in a core zone of with population density estimated at 5.06 individuals per ; but only 12 individuals were identified in an edge zone of , which is more disturbed by humans, with density estimated at 3.13 individuals per .

=== Hunting and diet ===
When hunting, the clouded leopard stalks its prey or waits for the prey to approach. After making and feeding on a kill, it usually retreats into trees to digest and rest. Its prey includes both arboreal and terrestrial vertebrates.
Pocock presumed that it is adapted for preying upon herbivorous mammals of considerable bulk because of its powerful build, long canines and the deep penetration of its bites. In Thailand, clouded leopards have been observed preying on southern pig-tailed macaque (&quot;Macaca nemestrina&quot;), Indian hog deer (&quot;Axis porcinus&quot;), Bengal slow loris (&quot;Nycticebus bengalensis&quot;), Asiatic brush-tailed porcupine (&quot;Atherurus macrourus&quot;), Malayan pangolin (&quot;Manis javanica&quot;) and Berdmore&#x27;s ground squirrel (&quot;Menetes berdmorei&quot;). Known prey species in China include barking deer (&quot;Muntiacus&quot; sp.) and pheasants.
In northern Peninsular Malaysia, a male clouded leopard was photographed while carrying a binturong (&quot;Arctictis binturong&quot;) in its jaws.

===Reproduction and life cycle===

Both males and females average 26 months at first reproduction. The female is in estrus for about six days, with her estrous cycle lasting about 30 days. In the wild, mating usually occurs between December and March. The pair mates multiple times over the course of several days. The male grasps the female by the neck who responds with vocalization. Occasionally, he also bites her during courtship and is very aggressive during sexual encounters. Females can bear one litter each year. The male is not involved in raising the cubs.

The female gives birth to a litter of one to five, mostly three cubs, after a gestation period of 93 ± 6 days. Cubs are born with closed eyes and weigh from . Their spots are solid dark, rather than dark rings. Their eyes open after about 10 days. They are active within five weeks and fully weaned at around three months of age. They attain the adult coat pattern at around six months and become independent after around 10 months.

Captive clouded leopards have an average lifespan of 11 years.
One individual has lived to be almost 17 years old.

The generation length of the clouded leopard is about seven years.

== Threats ==

Clouded leopard require larger areas of intact forest than are present in many parts of their range. They are threatened by habitat loss following large–scale deforestation and commercial poaching for the wildlife trade. In Myanmar, 301 body parts of at least 279 clouded leopards, mostly skins and skeletons, were observed in four markets surveyed between 1991 and 2006, despite the protected status of clouded leopards in Myanmar. Some markets are located near Myanmar&#x27;s borders with China and Thailand and are used to facilitate cross-border smuggling.

In Nepal, 27 cases of clouded leopard body parts were discovered between November 1988 and March 2020 in nine districts of the country, comprising at least 51 individual clouded leopards. In 17 of these cases, the poachers and traders were arrested.

== Conservation ==

The clouded leopard is listed in CITES Appendix I. Hunting is banned in Bangladesh, China, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. These bans, however, are poorly enforced in India, Malaysia and Thailand.

In the United States, the clouded leopard is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act, prohibiting trade in live animals or body parts.

International Clouded Leopard Day is celebrated each year on 4 August since 2018 in zoos and conservation organizations all over the world.

=== In captivity ===

Clouded leopards have been kept in zoos since the early 20th century. The international studbook was initiated in the 1970s. Coordinated breeding programs were started in the 1980s and encompass the European Endangered Species Programme, the Species Survival Plan, and the Indian Conservation Breeding Programme. As of 2014, 64 institutions keep clouded leopards.

Early captive-breeding programs involving clouded leopards were not successful, largely due to ignorance of their courtship behaviour. Males have the reputation of being aggressive towards females. For breeding success, it has been deemed extremely important that male and female clouded leopards are compatible. Introducing pairs at a young age gives them opportunities to bond and breed successfully. Facilities breeding clouded leopards need to provide the female with a secluded, off-exhibit area. There has been some recent captive breeding success using artificial insemination with cubs successfully born in 1992, 2015 and 2017.

A study on morbidity and mortality rate of 271 captive clouded leopards across 44 zoos in Europe, Asia and Australia showed that 17% of them died because of respiratory disease, 12% due to maternal neglect and starvation, 10% from generalized infectious disease, 10% from digestive diseases, and 10% from trauma.

In March 2011, two breeding females at the Nashville Zoo at Grassmere gave birth to three cubs, which were raised by zookeepers. Each cub weighed . In June 2011, two cubs were born at the Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium. The breeding pair was brought from the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand in an ongoing education and research exchange program. Four cubs were born at Nashville Zoo in 2012. In May 2015, four cubs were born in Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium.

== In culture ==
The clouded leopard is the state animal of the Indian state of Meghalaya. In the 1970s, the print of Rama Samaraweera&#x27;s painting &quot;Clouded leopard&quot; was a best-seller in the US.

<text>Public capital is the aggregate body of government-owned assets that are used as a means for productivity. Such assets span a wide range including: large components such as highways, airports, roads, transit systems, and railways; local, municipal components such as public education, public hospitals, police and fire protection, prisons, and courts; and critical components including water and sewer systems, public electric and gas utilities, and telecommunications. Often, public capital is defined as government outlay, in terms of money, and as physical stock, in terms of infrastructure.

==Current state in the U.S.==

In 1988, the U.S. infrastructure system including all public and private non-residential capital stock was valued at $7 trillion, an immense portfolio to operate and manage. And according to the Congressional Budget Office, in 2004 the U.S. invested $400 billion in infrastructure capital across federal, state, and local levels including the private sectors on transportation networks, schools, highways, water systems, energy, and telecommunications services. While public spending on infrastructure grew by 1.7% annually between 1956 and 2004, it has remained constant as a share of GDP since early 1980s. Despite the value and investment of public capital, growing delays in air and surface transportation, aging electric grid, an untapped renewable energy sector, and inadequate school facilities all have justified additional funding in public capital investment.

The American Society of Civil Engineers have continued to give low marks, averaging a D grade, for the nation&#x27;s infrastructure since its inception of the Report Card in 1998. In 2009, each category of infrastructure varied from C+ to D− grades with an estimated $2.2 trillion of needed public capital investment. The aviation sector remains mired in continued delays in the reauthorization of federal programs and an outdated air traffic control system. One in four rural bridges and one in three urban bridges are structurally deficient. States are understaffed and underfunded to conduct safety inspections of dams. Texas alone has only seven engineers and an annual budget of $435,000 to oversee more than 7,400 dams. Electricity demand outpaces energy supply transmission and generation. Almost half of the water locks maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are functionally obsolete. Drinking water faces an annual shortfall of $11 billion to manage their aging facilities and comply with federal regulations. Leaking pipes lose an estimated of clean drinking water a day. Under tight budgets, national, state, and local parks suffer neglect. Without adequate funding, rail cannot meet future freight tonnage load. Schools require a staggering $127 billion to bring facilities to decent operating condition. Billions of gallons of untreated sewage continue to be discharged into U.S.’s surface waters each year.

==Economic growth==

One of the most classic macroeconomic inquiries is the effect of public capital investment on economic growth. While many analysts debate the magnitude, evidence has shown a statistically significant positive relationship between infrastructure investment and economic performance. U.S. Federal Reserve economist David Alan Aschauer asserted an increase of the public capital stock by 1% would result in an increase of the total factor productivity by 0.4%. Aschauer argues that the golden age of the 1950s and 1960s were partly due to the post-World War II substantial investment in core infrastructure (highways, mass transit, airports, water systems, electric/gas facilities). Conversely, the drop of U.S. productivity growth in the 1970s and 1980s was in response to the decrease of continual public capital investment and not the decline of technological innovation. Likewise, the European Union nations have declined public capital investment through the same years, also witnessing declining productivity growth rates. A similar situation emerges in developing nations. Analyzing OECD and non-OECD countries’ real-GDP growth rates from 1960 to 2000 with public capital as an explanatory variable (not using public investment rates), Arslanalp, Borhorst, Gupta, and Sze (2010) show that increases in the public capital stock does correlate with increases in growth. However, this relationship depends on initial levels of public capital and income levels for the country. Thus, OECD countries witness a stronger positive link in the short term while non-OECD countries experience a stronger positive link in the long term. Hence, developing countries can benefit from non-concessional foreign borrowing to finance high-prospect public capital investments.

Given this relationship of public capital and productivity, public capital becomes a third input in the standard, neoclassical production function:

:formula_1

where: 
:&quot;Y&quot;&quot;t&quot; represents real aggregate output of goods and services of the private sector
:&quot;A&quot;&quot;t&quot; represents productivity factor or Hicks-Neutral technical change
:&quot;N&quot;&quot;t&quot; represents aggregate employment of labor services
:&quot;K&quot;&quot;t&quot; represents aggregate stock of nonresidential capital
:&quot;G&quot;&quot;t&quot; represents flow of public capital stock (assuming services of public capital are proportional to public capital)

In this form, public capital has a direct influence on productivity as a third variable. Additionally, public capital has an indirect influence on multifactor productivity as it affects the other two inputs of labor and private capital. Despite this unique nature, public capital investment, used in the production process of nearly every sector, is not sufficient on its own to generate sustained economic growth. Thus, rather than the ends, public capital is the means. That is, instead of being seen as intermediate goods used as resources by businesses, public capital should be seen as goods which are used to make the final goods and services to consumers-taxpayers. Note that public capital levels should not be too high that it leads to financing costs and high tax rates issues which will negate the positive benefits of such investments. Moreover, infrastructure services carry the market-distorting features of pure, non-rival public goods; network externalities; natural monopolies; and the common resource problem such as congestion and overuse.

Empirical models that attempt to estimate the public investment and economic growth link involve a wide variety including: the Cobb-Douglas production function; a behavioral approach cost/profit function which includes public capital stock; Vector Auto Regression (VAR) models; and government investment growth regressions. These models nonetheless contend with reverse causality, heterogeneity, endogeneity, and nonlinearities in trying to capture the public capital and economic growth link. New Keynesian models, though, analyze the effect of government spending through the supply side rather than traditional Keynesian models that analyzes it through the demand side. Therefore, a temporary surge of infrastructure investment yields an expansion of output, and vice versa that dwindling infrastructure, like in the 1970s, hamper longer-term movement in productivity. Furthermore, new research on regional growth (as opposed to national growth with GDP) shows a strong positive relationship between public capital and productivity. Both fixed costs and transport costs lower with expanded infrastructure in localities and the resulting cluster of industries. As a result, economic activity grows along its pattern of trade. Therefore, the importance of regional clusters and metropolitan economies comes into effect.

==Social benefit==

Beyond economic performance, public capital investment yields returns in quality of life indicators such as health, safety, recreation, aesthetics, and leisure time and activities. In example, highways provide better access and mobility for increased discretionary time and recreational outlets; mass transit can improve air quality with reduced number of private vehicles; improved municipal waste facilities reduces toxic groundwater contamination and better green space aesthetics such as parks; expanded water facilities aids in health and sanitation and environment such as reducing odor and sewer overflows. Furthermore, infrastructure adds to community ambience and quality of place with livelier downtowns, vibrant waterfronts, efficient land uses, compact spaces for commerce and recreation.

On the contrary, inadequate public capital impairs quality of life and social well-being. Over-capacity landfills lead to groundwater contamination, having deleterious effects on health. Deficient supply and quality of mass transit services impacts transit-dependents on their access to opportunity and resources. Increasing congestion in airports and roadways causes loss of discretionary time and recreational activities. The lack of efficient U.S. freight and passenger rail service will neither aid in handling the “perfect storm” of environmental and energy sustainability nor meet the global competitive need of transporting goods and services at heightened speeds and times. Also, the continued loss of footing in clean energy technology will contribute to U.S.’s future loss of prosperity on the global stage in terms of the carbon footprint and economy.

==Public capital initiatives==

===United States===

Perhaps the largest contribution to the public works system in the U.S. came out of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal initiatives particularly the creation of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in 1935. At a time of a deep economic crisis, the WPA employed at its peak 3.35 million unemployed heads-of-households to work in rebuilding the country. The program helped construct millions of roads, bridges, parks, schools, hospitals, and levees while also providing educational programs, childcare, job training, and medical services. The overall public spending level for the program, unprecedented at the time, was $4.8 billion ($76 billion in 2008 dollars), and helped to stimulate the economy through public works projects.

Since then, the U.S. has contributed to other large infrastructure programs including the Interstate Highway System, 1956-1990, with a dedicated financing system through the gas tax and a matching contribution between federal government and states at 90% to 10%. Also, the Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s (EPA) Clean Water Act of 1972 provided a public capital investment of $40 billion in constructing and upgrading sewage treatment facilities with “significant positive impacts on the Nation’s water quality.” Considered by the National Academy of Engineering to be the greatest engineering achievement of the 20th century, the North American electric grid carries electricity over on high-voltage transmission lines across the U.S. Though currently facing aging facilities and equipment, this public capital investment has ubiquitously reached millions of homes and businesses.

Recently, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) is another example of large public capital investment. Of the $311 billion in appropriations, about $120 billion are set aside for crucial investment in Infrastructure and Science and Energy. Some of ARRA&#x27;s aims include smart grid technology, retrofitting of homes and federal buildings, automated aviation traffic control, advancing freight and passenger rail services, and upgrading water and waste facilities.

===Other countries===

Worldwide, transformative public capital investments are taking place. China’s ambitious rapid high-speed rail program is estimated to extend 18,000 km by 2020. By the end of 2008, the country had a fleet of over 24,000 locomotives, the most lines in the world, the fastest express train in service, and longest high-speed track in the world. UK, Denmark, and other countries in northern Europe that surround the Baltic Sea and North Sea, continue to develop their rapid expansion of off-shore wind farms. With continued expansion of terminals and connection to nation&#x27;s comprehensive transport system, the Hong Kong International Airport is one of the largest engineering and architectural projects in the world. In the last decade, Chile installed five combined cycle gas-turbined (CCGT) power plants to meet its nation&#x27;s growing energy needs.

<text>Physical capital represents in economics one of the three primary factors of production. Physical capital is the apparatus used to produce a good and services. Physical capital represents the tangible man-made goods that help and support the production. Inventory, cash, equipment or real estate are all examples of physical capital.

==Definition==
N.G. Mankiw definition from the book Economics: 
&quot;Capital is the equipment and structures used to produce goods and services. Physical capital consists of man-made goods (or input into the process of production) that assist in the production process. Cash, real estate, equipment, and inventory are examples of physical capital.&quot;
Capital goods represents one of the key factors of corporation function. Generally, capital allows a company to preserve liquidity while growing operations, it refers to physical assets in business and the way a company have reached their physical capital. While referring how companies have obtained their capital it is important to consider both - physical capital and human capital. Based on economic theory, physical capital represents one of the three primary factors of production, that is also recognized as inputs production function. The others are natural resources (including land), and labour. The word &quot;Physical&quot; is used to distinguish physical capital from human capital and financial capital. &quot;Physical capital&quot; denote to fixed capital, all other sorts of real physical asset that are not included in the production of a product is distinguished from circulating capital. 

==Physical capital in accounting==
Biased on the order of solvency of a physical capital, it is listed on the balance sheet. The impact of investments of human capital and physical capital can be measured and analysed with the same ratios to measure and analyse the investment performance of physical assets. Both of these investments lead to fundamental improvements in the business model and better overall decision-making. The balance sheet provides an overview, which consist of both physical and human capital, of the value of all physical and some non-physical assets, but it also provides an overview of the capital raised to pay for those assets.
Physical capital is noted on the balance sheet as an asset at historical cost, not market value. As a result, the book value of assets is generally higher than market value. Accountants refer to physical capital as a tangible asset. Compering the physical capital and human capital is easy to find on the balance, but the human capital is often only assumed. In addition to goodwill, analysts can value the impact of human capital on operations with efficiency ratios, such as return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). The value of human capital can be also determined by the investors in the mark-up on products sold or the industry premium on salary, for instance a company is willing to pay more for an experienced programmer who can produce a higher-margin product. In this case the value of the programmer&#x27;s experience is the amount the company is willing to pay over and above the market price. 

==Production function==
Production function definition by N.G. Mankiw:
&quot;Production function is the relationship between the quantity of inputs used to make a good and the quantity of output of that good.&quot;

Co-operation of four factors of production capital, land, labor and organization crates the result in production of goods, biased on this fact no goods can be produced without the help of these four factors, actually all four are usually used in some technical proportion, with the aim to maximize profit with a minimal cost by the best combination of factors of production. Best combination for producer is enabled by applying the principles of equip-marginal returns and substitution. The principle of equip-marginal returns states that, any producer can have maximum production only when the marginal returns of all the factors of production are equal. For instance, when the marginal product of the land is equal to that of labour, capital and organisation, the production becomes maximum. Production function shoes how much output producer can expect in exact proportion of labour and capital as well as of labour etc. Differently, production function is an indicator of the physical relationship between the inputs and output of a firm.
Like the demand function a production function is for a definite period. It shows the flow of inputs resulting into a flow of output during some time. The production function of a firm depends on the state of technology. With every development in technology the production function of the firm undergoes a change.
The new production function brought about by developing technology displays same inputs and more output or the same output with lesser inputs. Sometimes a new production function of the firm may be adverse as it takes more inputs to produce the same output.
Mathematical description of basic relationship between inputs and outputs:

Q = f (L, C, N)
Q = Quantity of output
L = Labour
C = Capital
N = Land

The level of output (Q) depends on the quantities of different inputs (L, C, N) available to the firm. In the simplest case, where there are only two inputs, labour (L) and capital (C) and one output (Q), the production function becomes.
Q =f (L, C)
The production function is a technical or engineering relation between input and output. If the natural laws of technology remain unchanged, the production function remains unchanged.

==Features of production function==
The production function consists of 3 main features – Substitutability, Complementarity and Specificity. 1. Substitutability: By changing the number and amount of some inputs, while the others stay unchanged, we achieve the possibility, to modify the total output. It is the substitutability of the factors of production that gives rise to the laws of variable proportions. 2. Complementarity: is that two or more inputs are to be used together as nothing will be produced if the quantity of either of the inputs used in the production process is zero. Another example of complementarity is the principles of returns to scale of inputs as it reveals that the quantity of all inputs has to increased simultaneously in order to attain a higher scale of total output. 3. Specificity: Every product has its own specific number and type of inputs. Machines and equipment&#x27;s, specialized workers and raw materials or commodities are a few examples of the specificity of factors of production. This reveals that in the production process none of the factors can be ignored and in some cases ignorance to even slightest extent is not possible if the factors are perfectly specific. Production consists of time; hence, the way the inputs are combined is determined to a large extent by the time period under consideration. The greater the time period, the greater the freedom the producer must vary the quantities of various inputs used in the production process. In the production function, variation in total output by varying the quantities of all inputs is possible only in the long run whereas the variation in total output by varying the quantity of single input may be possible even in the short run.

<text>Social capital is a concept used in sociology and economics to define networks of relationships which are productive towards advancing the goals of individuals and groups.
It involves the effective functioning of social groups through interpersonal relationships, a shared sense of identity, a shared understanding, shared norms, shared values, trust, cooperation, and reciprocity. Some have described it as a form of capital that produces public goods for a common purpose, although this does not align with how it has been measured.

Social capital has been used to explain the improved performance of diverse groups, the growth of entrepreneurial firms, superior managerial performance, enhanced supply chain relations, the value derived from strategic alliances, and the evolution of communities. 

== History ==
While it has been suggested that the term &quot;social capital&quot; was in intermittent use from about 1890, before becoming widely used in the late 1990s, the earliest credited use is by Lyda Hanifan in 1916 (see 20th century below).

The debate of community versus modernization of society and individualism has been the most discussed topic among the founders of sociology: such theorists as Tönnies (1887), Durkheim (1893), Simmel (1905), Weber (1946) were convinced that industrialisation and urbanization were transforming social relationships in an irreversible way. They observed a breakdown of traditional bonds and the progressive development of anomie and alienation in society.

=== 18th–19th century ===
The power of &quot;community governance&quot; has been stressed by many philosophers from antiquity to the 18th century, from Aristotle to Thomas Aquinas, and Edmund Burke. This vision was strongly criticised at the end of the 18th century, with the development of the idea of &quot;Homo Economicus&quot; and subsequently with &quot;rational choice theory&quot;. Such a set of theories became dominant in the last centuries, but many thinkers questioned the complicated relationship between &quot;modern society&quot; and the importance of &quot;old institutions&quot;, in particular family and traditional communities.

The concept that underlies social capital has a much longer history; thinkers exploring the relation between associational life and democracy were using similar concepts regularly by the 19th century, drawing on the work of earlier writers such as James Madison (&quot;The Federalist Papers&quot;) and Alexis de Tocqueville (&quot;Democracy in America&quot;) to integrate concepts of social cohesion and connectedness into the pluralist tradition in American political science. John Dewey may have made the first direct mainstream use of &quot;social capital&quot; in &quot;The School and Society&quot; in 1899, though he did not offer a definition.

In the first half of the 19th century, de Tocqueville had observations about American life that seemed to outline and define social capital. He observed that Americans were prone to meeting at as many gatherings as possible to discuss all possible issues of state, economics, or the world that could be witnessed. The high levels of transparency caused greater participation from the people and thus allowed for democracy to work better.

=== 20th century ===
L. J. Hanifan&#x27;s 1916 article regarding local support for rural schools is one of the first occurrences of the term &quot;social capital&quot; in reference to social cohesion and personal investment in the community. In defining the concept, Hanifan contrasts social capital with material goods by defining it as:I do not refer to real estate, or to personal property or to cold cash, but rather to that in life which tends to make these tangible substances count for most in the daily lives of people, namely, goodwill, fellowship, mutual sympathy and social intercourse among a group of individuals and families who make up a social unit.… If he may come into contact with his neighbour, and they with other neighbours, there will be an accumulation of social capital, which may immediately satisfy his social needs and which may bear a social potentiality sufficient to the substantial improvement of living conditions in the whole community. The community as a whole will benefit by the cooperation of all its parts, while the individual will find in his associations the advantages of the help, the sympathy, and the fellowship of his neighbours.
Following the works of Tönnies (1887) and Weber (1946), reflection on social links in modern society continued with interesting contributions in the 1950s and in the 1960s. In particular, &quot;mass society theory&quot;as developed by Daniel Bell (1962), Robert Nisbet (1969), Maurice R. Stein (1960), William H. Whyte (1956)proposed themes similar to those of the founders, with a more pessimistic emphasis on the development of society. In the words of Stein (1960:1): &quot;The price for maintaining a society that encourages cultural differentiation and experimentation is unquestionably the acceptance of a certain amount of disorganization on both the individual and social level.&quot;

Jane Jacobs used the term early in the 1960s. Although she did not explicitly define the term &quot;social capital&quot;, her usage referred to the value of networks. Political scientist Robert Salisbury advanced the term as a critical component of interest group formation in his 1969 article &quot;An Exchange Theory of Interest Groups&quot; in the &quot;Midwest Journal of Political Science&quot;.

Sociologist Pierre Bourdieu used the term in 1972 in his &quot;Outline of a Theory of Practice&quot;, and clarified the term some years later in contrast to cultural, economic, administrative capital, physical capital, political capital, social capital and symbolic capital. Sociologists James Coleman (1988), as well as Barry Wellman &amp; Scot Wortley (1990), adopted Glenn Loury&#x27;s 1977 definition in developing and popularising the concept. In the late 1990s, the concept gained popularity, serving as the focus of a World Bank research programme and the subject of several mainstream books, including Robert Putnam&#x27;s &quot;Bowling Alone&quot;, and Putnam &amp; Lewis Feldstein&#x27;s &quot;Better Together&quot;.

All of these reflections contributed remarkably to the development of the social capital concept in the following decades. The appearance of the modern social capital conceptualization is a new way to look at this debate, keeping together the importance of community to build generalized trust and the same time, the importance of individual free choice, in order to create a more cohesive society. It is for this reason that social capital generated so much interest in the academic and political world.

== Definitions and forms ==

Social capital has multiple definitions, interpretations, and uses. David Halpern argues that the popularity of social capital for policymakers is linked to the concept&#x27;s duality, coming because &quot;it has a hard nosed economic feel while restating the importance of the social.&quot; For researchers, the term is popular partly due to the broad range of outcomes it can explain; the multiplicity of uses for social capital has led to a multiplicity of definitions.

Social capital has been used at various times to explain superior managerial performance, the growth of entrepreneurial firms, improved performance of functionally diverse groups, the value derived from strategic alliances, and enhanced supply-chain relations. &quot;A resource that actors derive from specific social structures and then use to pursue their interests; it is created by changes in the relationship among actors&quot; (Baker 1990, p. 619).

Early attempts to define social capital focused on the degree to which social capital serves as a resource – be it for public good or private benefit. Robert D. Putnam (1993) suggested that social capital would facilitate co-operation and mutually supportive relations in communities and nations and would therefore be a valuable means of combating many of the social disorders inherent in modern societies, for example crime. In contrast, others focus on the private benefits derived from the web of social relationships in which individual actors find themselves. This is reflected in Nan Lin&#x27;s concept of social capital as &quot;Investment in social relations with expected returns in the marketplace.&quot; This may subsume the concepts of some others such as Bourdieu, Flap and Eriksson. Newton (1997) treats social capital as a subjective phenomenon formed by values and attitudes that influence interactions. Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998), in their examination of the role of social capital in the creation of intellectual capital, suggest that social capital should be considered in terms of three clusters: structural, relational, and cognitive.

=== Definitional issues ===

A number of scholars have raised concerns about the imprecision in defining social capital. Portes (2000), for example, notes that the term has become so widely used, including in mainstream media, that &quot;the point is approaching at which social capital comes to be applied to so many events and in so many different contexts as to lose any distinct meaning.&quot; The term &quot;capital&quot; is used by analogy with other forms of economic capital, as social capital is argued to have similar (although less measurable) benefits. However, the analogy may be misleading in that, unlike financial forms of capital, social capital is not depleted by use; instead, it is depleted by non-use (&quot;use it or lose it&quot;). In this respect, it is similar to the economic concept of human capital.

Robison, Schmid, and Siles (2002) review various definitions of social capital and conclude that many do not satisfy the formal requirements of a definition. They assert that definitions must be of the form A=B, while many explanations of social capital describe what it can be used to achieve, where it resides, how it can be created, or what it can transform. In addition, they argue that many proposed definitions of social capital fail to satisfy the requirements of capital. They propose that social capital be defined as &quot;sympathy&quot;: the object of another&#x27;s sympathy has social capital; those who have sympathy for others provide social capital. This proposition appears to follow Adam Smith, &quot;Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot; to some degree, but Smith&#x27;s conceptualization of sympathy (particularly in the first two chapters of this work) appear more concerned with the roles of acceptance or congruence – in ethics or virtue – in evaluating an individual&#x27;s &#x27;propriety of action&#x27;.

&quot;Social capital&quot; is different from the economic theory of social capitalism, which challenges the idea that socialism and capitalism are mutually exclusive.

=== Forms of capital (Bourdieu) ===
In &quot;The Forms of Capital&quot;, Pierre Bourdieu distinguishes between three forms of capital: economic capital, cultural capital and social capital. He defines &quot;social capital&quot; as &quot;the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition.&quot; His treatment of the concept is instrumental, focusing on the advantages to possessors of social capital and the &quot;&quot;deliberate construction of sociability for the purpose of creating this resource&quot;.&quot; Quite contrary to Putnam&#x27;s positive view of social capital, Bourdieu employs the concept to demonstrate a mechanism for the generational reproduction of inequality. Bourdieu thus points out that the wealthy and powerful use their &quot;old boys network&quot; or other social capital to maintain advantages for themselves, their social class, and their children.

=== Norms of trust and reciprocity (Sander, Putnam, Coleman) ===
Thomas Sander defines it as &quot;the collective value of all social networks (who people know), and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other (norms of reciprocity).&quot; Social capital, in this view, emphasizes &quot;specific benefits that flow from the trust, reciprocity, information, and cooperation associated with social networks.&quot; It &quot;creates value for the people who are connected, and for bystanders as well.&quot; Meanwhile, negative norms of reciprocity serve as disincentives for detrimental and violent behaviors.

James Coleman defined social capital functionally as &quot;a variety of entities with two elements in common: they all consist of some aspect of social structure, and they facilitate certain actions of actors...within the structure&quot;that is, social capital is anything that facilitates individual or collective action, generated by networks of relationships, reciprocity, trust, and social norms. In Coleman&#x27;s conception, social capital is a neutral resource that facilitates any manner of action, but whether society is better off as a result depends entirely on the individual uses to which it is put.

According to Robert D. Putnam, &quot;social capital&quot; refers to &quot;connections among individuals – social networks and the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness that arise from them.&quot; In the view of Putnam and his followers, social capital is a key component to building and maintaining democracy. Putnam says that social capital is declining in the United States. This is seen in lower levels of trust in government and lower levels of civic participation. Putnam also suggests that a root cause of the decline in social capital is women&#x27;s entry into the workforce, which could correlate with time restraints that inhibit civic organizational involvement like parent-teacher associations. Technological transformation of leisure (e.g., television) is another cause of declining social capital, as stated by Putnam. This offered a reference point from which several studies assessed social capital measurements by how media is engaged strategically to build social capital.

=== Civic association (Fukuyama) ===
In &quot;Social Capital, Civil Society, and Development&quot;, political economist Francis Fukuyama defines social capital as generally understood rules that enable people to cooperate such as the norm of reciprocity or religious doctrine like Christianity. Social capital is formed by repeated interactions over time and, he argues, is critical for development and difficult to generate through public policy. The importance of social capital for economic development is that these norms of behavior reduce transaction cost of exchange such as legal contracts and government regulations. Fukuyama suggests that while social capital is beneficial for development, it also imposes cost on non-group members with unintended consequences for general welfare.

Referencing Alexis de Tocqueville in &quot;Democracy in America,&quot; and what he described as the art of association of the American propensity for civil association, Fukuyama argues social capital is what produces a civil society. While civic engagement is an important part of democracy and development, Fukuyama states that, &quot;one person&#x27;s civic engagement is another&#x27;s rent-seeking.&quot; Therefore, while social capital can facilitate economic development by reducing transaction cost and increasing productivity, social capital can also distort democracy if civic association enables special interest to gain special favors. However, Fukuyama argues despite the risk of society having too much social capital, it is nonetheless worse to have too little and be unable to organize for public goods and welfare enhancing activity.

=== Social ties ===
Carlos García Timón describes that the structural dimensions of social capital relate to an individual ability to make weak and strong ties to others within a system. This dimension focuses on the advantages derived from the configuration of an actor&#x27;s, either individual or collective, network. The differences between &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;strong&quot; ties are explained by Granovetter (1973). Bridging social capital refers to the weak ties that individuals with heterogeneous limited interactions form. Bridging social capital is more likely to provide valuable new information (Moshkovitz and Hayat, 2021). Some others describes the weak and strong ties relationship as bonding and bridging social capital. Bonding social capital refers to strong ties: the intimate relationships people feel close to and trust. The relational dimension focuses on the character of the connection between individuals. This is best characterized through trust of others and their cooperation and the identification an individual has within a network. Hazleton and Kennan (2000) added a third angle, that of communication. Communication is needed to access and use social capital through exchanging information, identifying problems and solutions, and managing conflict.

According to Boisot (1995), and Boland &amp; Tenkasi (1995), meaningful communication requires at least some sharing context between the parties to such exchange. The cognitive dimension focuses on the shared meaning, representations and interpretations that individuals or groups have with one another.

== Negative social capital ==
Whereas some scholars, most prominently Robert D. Putnam, posit that social capital has positive ends, a sizable body of literature finds that social capital can have adverse effects. Research by Sheri Berman and Dylan Riley, as well as economists Shanker Satyanath, Nico Voigtländer, and Hans-Joachim Voth, have linked civic associations to the rise of fascist movements. Pierre Bourdieu&#x27;s work tends to show how social capital can be used practically to produce or reproduce inequality, demonstrating for instance how people gain access to powerful positions through the direct and indirect employment of social connections.

An example of the complexities of the effects of negative social capital is violence or criminal gang activity that is encouraged through the strengthening of intra-group relationships (bonding social capital). The negative consequences of social capital are more often associated with &quot;bonding&quot; vis-à-vis &quot;bridging&quot;.

Without &quot;bridging&quot; social capital, &quot;bonding&quot; groups can become isolated and disenfranchised from the rest of society and, most importantly, from groups with which bridging must occur in order to denote an &quot;increase&quot; in social capital. Bonding social capital is a necessary antecedent for the development of the more powerful form of bridging social capital. Bonding and bridging social capital can work together productively if in balance, or they may work against each other. As social capital bonds and stronger homogeneous groups form, the likelihood of bridging social capital is attenuated. Bonding social capital can also perpetuate sentiments of a certain group, allowing for the bonding of certain individuals together upon a common radical ideal. The strengthening of insular ties can lead to a variety of effects such as ethnic marginalization or social isolation. In extreme cases ethnic cleansing may result if the relationship between different groups is so strongly negative. In mild cases, it isolates certain communities such as suburbs of cities because of the bonding social capital and the fact that people in these communities spend so much time away from places that build bridging social capital.

=== Accessibility ===
Edwards and Foley, as editors of a special edition of the &quot;American Behavioral Scientist&quot; on &quot;Social Capital, Civil Society and Contemporary Democracy&quot;, raised two key issues in the study of social capital. First, social capital is not equally available to all, in much the same way that other forms of capital are differently available. Geographic and social isolation limit access to this resource. Second, not all social capital is created equally. The value of a specific source of social capital depends in no small part on the socio-economic position of the source with society.

On top of this, Portes (1998) has identified four negative consequences of social capital:

# exclusion of outsiders;
# excess claims on group members;
# restrictions on individual freedom; and
# downward levelling norms.

=== In political institutions ===
Social capital (in the institutional Robert Putnam sense) may also lead to bad outcomes if the political institution and democracy in a specific country is not strong enough and is therefore overpowered by the social capital groups. &quot;Civil society and the collapse of the Weimar Republic&quot; suggests that &quot;it was weak political institutionalization rather than a weak civil society that was Germany&#x27;s main problem during the Wihelmine and Weimar eras.&quot; Because the political institutions were so weak people looked to other outlets. &quot;Germans threw themselves into their clubs, voluntary associations, and professional organizations out of frustration with the failures of the national government and political parties, thereby helping to undermine the Weimar Republic and facilitate Hitler&#x27;s rise to power.&quot; In this article about the fall of the Weimar Republic, the author makes the claim that Hitler rose to power so quickly because he was able to mobilize the groups towards one common goal. Even though German society was, at the time, a &quot;joining&quot; society these groups were fragmented and their members did not use the skills they learned in their club associations to better their society, but to encourage their values across all cultures to provide a better society for people. They were very introverted in the Weimar Republic. Hitler was able to capitalize on this by uniting these highly bonded groups under the common cause of bringing Germany to the top of world politics. The former world order had been destroyed during World War I, and Hitler believed that Germany had the right and the will to become a dominant global power.

Additionally, in his essay &quot;A Criticism of Putnam&#x27;s Theory of Social Capital&quot;, Michael Shindler expands upon Berman&#x27;s argument that Weimar social clubs and similar associations in countries that did not develop democracy, were organized in such a way that they fostered a &quot;we&quot; instead of an &quot;I&quot; mentality among their members, by arguing that groups which possess cultures that stress solidarity over individuality, even ones that are &quot;horizontally&quot; structured and which were also common to pre-Soviet Eastern Europe, will not engender democracy if they are politically aligned with non-democratic ideologies.

=== In race and ethnicity ===

Using a network-based conception for characterizing the social capital of collectivities (such as organizations or business clusters), Lester, Maheshwari, and McLain (2013) note that negative social capital may be the cause for disadvantageous differences among minority firms versus majority firms. While studying norms among African-American family firms and Euro-American family firms, Lester et al. noted that negative social capital was created when the owner of the company was pressured to engage in social behavior not conducive to firm profits.

Robert Putnam, in his later work, also suggests that social capital, and the associated growth of public trust are inhibited by immigration and rising racial diversity in communities. Putnam&#x27;s study regarding the issue argued that in American areas with a lack of homogeneity, some individuals neither participated in bonding nor bridging social capital. In societies where immigration is high (US) or where ethnic heterogeneity is high (Eastern Europe), it was found that citizens lacked in both kinds of social capital and were overall far less trusting of others than members of homogenous communities were found to be. Lack of homogeneity led to people withdrawing from even their closest groups and relationships, creating an atomized society as opposed to a cohesive community. These findings challenge previous beliefs that exposure to diversity strengthens social capital, either through bridging social gaps between ethnicities or strengthening in-group bonds. It is very important for policy makers to monitor the level of perceived socio-economic threat from immigrants because negative attitudes towards immigrants make integration difficult and affect social capital.

Varshney (2001) studied the correlation between the presence of interethnic networks (&quot;bridging&quot;) versus intra-ethnic ones (&quot;bonding&quot;) on ethnic violence in India.
He argues that interethnic networks are agents of peace because they build bridges and manage tensions, by noting that if communities are organized only along intra-ethnic lines and the interconnections with other communities are very weak or even nonexistent, then ethnic violence is quite likely.
Three main implications of intercommunal ties explain their worth:
# Facilitate communication in the community across ethnic lines
# Squelch false rumors
# Help the administration carry out its job and in particular peace, security and justice

This is a useful distinction; nevertheless, its implication on social capital can only be accepted if one espouses the functionalist understanding of the latter concept. Indeed, it can be argued that interethnic, as well as intra-ethnic networks can serve various purposes, either increasing or diminishing social capital. In fact, Varshney himself notes that intra-ethnic policing (equivalent to the &quot;self-policing&quot; mechanism proposed by Fearon and Laitin, 1996) may lead to the same result as interethnic engagement.

=== Social inequality ===
James Coleman (1988) has indicated that social capital eventually led to the creation of human capital for the future generation. Human capital, a private resource, could be accessed through what the previous generation accumulated through social capital. John Field (2003) suggested that such a process could lead to the very inequality social capital attempts to resolve. While Coleman viewed social capital as a relatively neutral resource, he did not deny the class reproduction that could result from accessing such capital, given that individuals worked toward their own benefit.

Even though Coleman never truly addresses Pierre Bourdieu in his discussion, this coincides with Bourdieu&#x27;s argument set forth in &quot;Reproduction in Education, Society and Culture&quot;. Bourdieu and Coleman were fundamentally different at the theoretical level (as Bourdieu believed the actions of individuals were rarely ever conscious, but more so only a result of their &quot;habitus&quot; being enacted within a particular field, but this realization by both seems to undeniably connect their understanding of the more latent aspects of social capital.

According to Bourdieu, habitus refers to the social context within which a social actor is socialized. Thus, it is the social platform, itself, that equips one with the social reality they become accustomed to. Out of habitus comes field, the manner in which one integrates and displays their habitus. To this end, it is the social exchange and interaction between two or more social actors. To illustrate this, we assume that an individual wishes to better his place in society. He therefore accumulates social capital by involving himself in a social network, adhering to the norms of that group, allowing him to later access the resources (e.g. social relationships) gained over time. If, in the case of education, he uses these resources to better his educational outcomes, thereby enabling him to become socially mobile, he effectively has worked to reiterate and reproduce the stratification of society, as social capital has done little to alleviate the system as a whole. This may be one negative aspect of social capital, but seems to be an inevitable one in and of itself, as are all forms of capital.

== Positive consequences of social capital ==
Compared to Bourdieu, Robert D. Putnam has used the concept in a much more positive light: though he was at first careful to argue that social capital was a neutral term, stating &quot;whether or not [the] shared are praiseworthy is, of course, entirely another matter,&quot; his work on American society tends to frame social capital as a producer of &quot;civic engagement&quot; and also a broad societal measure of communal health. He also transforms social capital from a resource possessed by individuals to an attribute of collectives, focusing on norms and trust as producers of social capital to the exclusion of networks.

Mahyar Arefi (2003) identifies consensus-building as a direct positive indicator of social capital. Consensus implies &quot;shared interest&quot; and agreement among various actors and stakeholders to induce collective action. &quot;Collective action&quot; is thus an indicator of increased social capital.

== Subtypes ==

=== Bonding, bridging, linking ===
In &quot;Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community&quot; (2000), Harvard political scientist Robert D. Putnam writes:Henry Ward Beecher&#x27;s advice a century ago to &#x27;multiply picnics&#x27; is not entirely ridiculous today. We should do this, ironically, not because it will be good for America – though it will be – but because it will be good for us.Putnam speaks of two main components of the concept, the creation of which Putnam credits to Ross Gittell and Avis Vidal:

# Bonding social capital: the value assigned to social networks between homogeneous groups of people.
# Bridging social capital: the value assigned to social networks between socially heterogeneous groups.

Typical examples are that criminal gangs create bonding social capital, while choirs and bowling clubs (hence the title, as Putnam lamented their decline) create bridging social capital. The distinction is useful in highlighting how social capital may not always be beneficial for society as a whole (though it is always an asset for those individuals and groups involved). Horizontal networks of individual citizens and groups that enhance community productivity and cohesion are said to be positive social capital assets whereas self-serving exclusive gangs and hierarchical patronage systems that operate at cross purposes to societal interests can be thought of as negative social capital burdens on society.

Similar to Putnam, Daniel P. Aldrich describes three mechanisms of social capital:

# Bonding capital: the relationships a person has with friends and family, making it also the strongest form of social capital. 
# Bridging capital: the relationship between friends of friends, making its strength secondary to bonding capital.
# Linking capital: the relationship between a person and a government official or other elected leader.

Aldrich also applies the ideas of social capital to the fundamental principles of disaster recovery, and discusses factors that either aid or impede recovery, such as extent of damage, population density, quality of government and aid. In his book &quot;Building Resilience: Social Capital in Post-Disaster Recovery&quot;, he primarily examines Japanese recovery following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown.

Social capital development on the internet via social networking websites such as Facebook or Myspace tends to be bridging capital according to one study, though &quot;virtual&quot; social capital is a new area of research.

=== Consummatory, instrumental ===
There are two other sub-sources of social capital:

# Consummatory capital: a behavior that is made up of actions that fulfill a basis of doing what is inherent. 
#* Examples include value interjection and solidarity.
# Instrumental capital: behavior that is taught through ones surroundings over time.

==== Consummatory capital ====
Consummatory capital a behavior that is made up of actions that fulfill a basis of doing what is inherent. Two examples of consummatory social capital are value interjection and solidarity.

Value interjection: refers to the behavior of individuals or groups adhering to societal norms by meeting expected obligations, such as following established rules, timely bill payments, and punctuality. Diligent adherence contributes personal advantages like financial stability and improved relationships, as well as broader societal gains, including enhanced market confidence and perceived reliability.

Coleman goes on to say that when people live in this way and benefit from this type of social capital, individuals in the society are able to rest assured that their belongings and family will be safe. This understanding of solidarity may be traced to 19th century socialist thinkers, whose main focus was the urban working class of the Industrial Revolution. They analyzed the reasons these workers supported each other for the benefit of the group and held that this support was an adaptation to the immediate social environment, as opposed to a trait that had been taught to the workers in their youth. As another example, Coleman states that possessing this type of social capital individuals to stand up for what they believe in, and even die for it, in the face of adversity.

While the notion of &quot;solidarity as social capital&quot; is sometimes attributed to Karl Marx, in particular, the term &quot;social capital&quot; had a quite different meaning for Marx. All forms of &quot;capital&quot; were, for Marx, possessed only by capitalists and he emphasized the basis of labour in capitalist society, as a class constituted by individuals obliged to sell their labour power, because they lacked sufficient capital, in any sense of the word, to do otherwise. Marx saw &quot;social capital&quot; as a theoretical total amount of capital, purely in the sense of accumulated wealth or property, that existed in a particular society. He thereby contrasted it with specific and discrete &quot;individual capital.&quot;

==== Instrumental capital ====
Instrumental capital is behavior that is taught through one&#x27;s surroundings over time. Individuals donating their resources are not seeking direct repayment from the recipient, but motivated by membership in the same social structure. Donors might not see a direct repayment, but, most commonly, they will be held by the society in greater honor.

Portes mentions the donation of a scholarship to a member of the same ethnic group as an example of this. The donor is not giving up resources to be directly repaid by the recipient, but, as stated above, the honor of the community. With this in mind, recipients might not know the benefactor personally, but prospers as a member of the same social group.

Social capital is also linked with religious communities. Religion represents an important aspect of social capital (religious social capital).

== Measurement ==

There is no widely held consensus on how to measure social capital, which has become a debate in itself. While usually one can intuitively sense the level/amount of social capital present in a given relationship (regardless of type or scale), quantitative measuring has proven somewhat complicated, resulting in different metrics for different functions.

Sociologists Carl L. Bankston and Min Zhou have argued that one of the reasons social capital is so difficult to measure is that it is neither an individual-level nor a group-level phenomenon, but one that emerges across levels of analysis as individuals participate in groups. They argue that the metaphor of &quot;capital&quot; may be misleading because, unlike financial capital, which is a resource held by an individual, the benefits of forms of social organization are not held by actors, but are results of the participation of actors in advantageously organized groups.

=== Name generators ===
One type of quantitative social capital measure uses name generators to construct social networks and to measure the level of social capital. These networks are constructed by asking participants to name people that they interact with, such as &quot;Name all the people you&#x27;ve discussed important matters with in the past six months.&quot; Name generators are often useful to construct core discussion networks of close ties, rather than weaker ties.

=== Social capital scales ===
Many studies measure social capital by asking the question: &quot;do you trust the others?&quot; Other researches analyse the participation in voluntary associations or civic activities.

To expand upon the methodological potential of measuring online and offline social bonding, as it relates to social capital, Williams (2006), offers a matrix of social capital measures that distinguishes social bridging as a form of less emotionally-tethered relationships compared to bonding. Bonding and bridging sub-scales are proposed, which have been adopted by over 300 scholarly articles.

Lin, Peng, Kim, Kim &amp; LaRose (2012) offer a noteworthy application of the scale by measuring international residents originating from locations outside of the United States. The study found that social media platforms like Facebook provide an opportunity for increased social capital, but mostly for extroverts. However, less introverted social media users could engage social media and build social capital by connecting with Americans before arriving and then maintaining old relationships from home upon arriving to the states. The ultimate outcome of the study indicates that social capital is measurable and is a concept that may be operationalized to understand strategies for coping with cross-cultural immersion through online engagement.

=== Cohesion measures ===
The level of cohesion of a group also affects its social capital and vice versa. However, there is no one quantitative way of determining the level of cohesiveness, but rather a collection of social network models that researchers have used over the decades to operationalize social capital. One of the dominant methods is Ronald Burt&#x27;s constraint measure, which taps into the role of tie strength and group cohesion. Another network-based model is network transitivity.

=== Economic measures ===
Knack and Keefer (1996) measured econometric correlations between confidence and civic cooperation norms, with economic growth in a large group of countries. They found that confidence and civic cooperation have a great impact in economic growth, and that in less polarized societies in terms of inequality and ethnic differences, social capital is bigger.

Narayan and Pritchet (1997) researched the associativity degree and economic performance in rural homes of Tanzania. They observed that even in high poverty indexes, families with higher levels of incomes had more participation in collective organizations. The social capital they accumulated because of this participation had individual benefits for them, and created collective benefits through different routes, for example: their agricultural practices were better than those of the families without participation (they had more information about agrochemicals, fertilizers and seeds); they had more information about the market; they were prepared to take more risks, because being part of a social network made them feel more protected; they had an influence on the improvement of public services, showing a bigger level of participation in schools; they cooperated more in the municipality level.

=== Group membership-based ===
In measuring political social capital, it is common to take the sum of society&#x27;s membership of its groups. Groups with higher membership (such as political parties) contribute more to the amount of capital than groups with lower membership, although many groups with low membership (such as communities) still add up to be significant. While it may seem that this is limited by population, this need not be the case as people join multiple groups. In a study done by Yankee City, a community of 17,000 people was found to have over 22,000 different groups.

How a group relates to the rest of society also affects social capital, but in a different manner. Strong internal ties can in some cases weaken the group&#x27;s perceived capital in the eyes of the general public, as in cases where the group is geared towards crime, distrust, intolerance, violence or hatred towards others. The Ku Klux Klan is an example of this kind of organizations.

=== Social behaviour-based ===
Foschi and Lauriola have presented a measure of sociability as a proxy of social capital. The authors demonstrated that facets of sociability can mediate between general personality traits and measures of civic involvement and political participation, as predictors of social capital, in a holistic model of political behavior.

The World Social Capital Monitor is an instrument for measuring social goods and social capital created by the United Nations Sustainable Development Group in partnership with civil society actors. The project identifies social values such as trust, solidarity, helpfulness, friendliness, hospitality and the willingness to finance public goods with the help of anonymous surveys. The surveys started in 2016.

== Integrating history and socio-economic analysis ==

=== Beyond Putnam ===
While influential, some have identified areas of concern or improvement within the work of Robert D. Putnam. This includes:
* the lack of awareness of the structural socio-economic conditions of society. For example, the level of income inequality.
* the excessive determinism of the historical analysis.
* Putnam&#x27;s social capital index does not consider racial diversity which links to worse outcomes. Nor does Putnam consider ethnic diversity, which often creates barriers to cooperation and democratization.
* the conflation of social capital with civil society, the lack of empirical evidence connecting social capital&#x27;s promotion of economic growth and substantiating the decline of social capital in the United States in the last 35 years, and the assumption that social networks produce win-win relationships.

=== Social capital motives ===
Robison and colleagues (2012) measured the relative importance of selfishness and four social capital motives using resource allocation data collected in hypothetical surveys and non-hypothetical experiments.

The selfishness motive assumes that an agent&#x27;s allocation of a scarce resource is independent of his relationships with others. This motive is sometimes referred to as the &quot;selfishness of preference assumption&quot; in neoclassical economics.

Social capital motives assume that agents&#x27; allocation of a scarce resource may be influenced by their social capital or sympathetic relationships with others which may produce socio-emotional goods that satisfy socio-emotional needs for validation and belonging:

# The first social capital motive seeks for validation by acting consistently with the values of one&#x27;s ideal self.
# The second social capital motive seeks to be validated by others by winning their approval.
# The third social capital motive seeks to belong. Recognizing that one may not be able to influence the sympathy of others, persons seeking to belong may act to increase their own sympathy for others and the organizations or institutions they represent.
# The fourth social capital motive recognizes that our sympathy or social capital for another person will motivate us to act in their interest. In doing so we satisfy our own needs for validation and belonging. Empirical results reject the hypothesis often implied in economics that we are 95% selfish.

== Relation with civil society ==
Various authors give definitions of &quot;civil society&quot; that refer to voluntary associations and organisations outside the market and state. This definition is very close to that of the &quot;third sector&quot;, which consists of &quot;private organisations that are formed and sustained by groups of people acting voluntarily and without seeking personal profit to provide benefits for themselves or for others.&quot;

According to such authors as Walzer (1992), Alessandrini (2002), Newtown, Stolle &amp; Rochon, Foley &amp; Edwards (1997), and Walters, it is through civil society, or more accurately, the &quot;third sector&quot;, that individuals are able to establish and maintain relational networks. These voluntary associations also connect people with each other, build trust and reciprocity through informal, loosely structured associations, and consolidate society through altruism without obligation. It is &quot;this range of activities, services and associations produced by... civil society&quot; that constitutes the sources of social capital.

Not only has civil society been documented to produce sources of social capital, according to Lyons&#x27; &quot;Third Sector&quot; (2001), social capital does not appear in any guise under either the factors that enable or those that stimulate the growth of the third sector. Likewise, Onyx (2000) describes how social capital depends on an already functioning community. The idea that creating social capital (i.e., creating networks) will strengthen civil society underlies current Australian social policy aimed at bridging deepening social divisions. The goal is to reintegrate those marginalised from the rewards of the economic system into &quot;the community.&quot; However, according to Onyx (2000), while the explicit aim of this policy is inclusion, its effects are exclusionary.

Foley and Edwards (1997) believe that &quot;political systems...are important determinants of both the character of civil society and of the uses to which whatever social capital exists might be put.&quot; Alessandrini agrees, saying that, &quot;in Australia in particular, neo-liberalism has been recast as economic rationalism and identified by several theorists and commentators as a danger to society at large because of the use to which they are putting social capital to work.&quot;

The resurgence of interest in social capital as a remedy for the cause of today&#x27;s social problems draws directly on the assumption that these problems lie in the weakening of civil society. However this ignores the arguments of many theorists who believe that social capital leads to exclusion rather than to a stronger civil society. In international development, Ben Fine (2001) and John Harriss (2001) have been heavily critical of the inappropriate adoption of social capital as a supposed panacea (promoting civil society organisations and NGOs, for example, as agents of development) for the inequalities generated by neoliberal economic development. This leads to controversy as to the role of state institutions in the promotion of social capital.
An abundance of social capital is seen as being almost a necessary condition for modern liberal democracy. A low level of social capital leads to an excessively rigid and unresponsive political system and high levels of corruption, in the political system and in the region as a whole. Formal public institutions require social capital in order to function properly, and while it is possible to have too much social capital (resulting in rapid changes and excessive regulation), it is decidedly worse to have too little.

=== Sample societies ===
Post-Communist: Kathleen Dowley and Brian Silver published an article entitled &quot;Social Capital, Ethnicity and Support for Democracy in the Post-Communist States&quot;, in which they find that in post-communist states, higher levels of social capital did not equate to higher levels of democracy. However, higher levels of social capital led to higher support for democracy.

Third-world: A number of intellectuals in developing countries have argued that the idea of social capital, particularly when connected to certain ideas about civil society, is deeply implicated in contemporary modes of donor and NGO-driven imperialism and that it functions, primarily, to blame the poor for their condition.

Chinese: The concept of social capital in a Chinese social context has been closely linked with the concept of &quot;guanxi&quot;.

American: One attempt to measure social capital, involving the quantity, quality and strength of an individual social capital, was spearheaded by Corporate Alliance in the English-speaking market segment of the US, and Xentrum through the Latin American Chamber of Commerce in Utah on the Spanish-speaking population of the same country. With the assistance of software applications and web-based relationship-oriented systems such as LinkedIn, these kinds of organizations are expected to provide its members with a way to keep track of the &quot;number&quot; of their relationships, meetings designed to boost the &quot;strength&quot; of each relationship using group dynamics, executive retreats and networking events as well as training in how to reach out to higher circles of &quot;influential&quot; people.

== Effects on women&#x27;s engagement with politics ==
There are many factors that drive volume towards the ballot box, including education, employment, civil skills, and time. Careful evaluation of these fundamental factors often suggests that women do not vote at similar levels as men. However the gap between women and men voter turnout is diminishing and in some cases women are becoming more prevalent at the ballot box than their male counterparts. Recent research on social capital is now serving as an explanation for this change.

Social capital offers a wealth of resources and networks that facilitate political engagement. Since social capital is readily available no matter the type of community, it is able to override more traditional queues for political engagement; e.g.: education, employment, civil skills, etc.

There are unique ways in which women organize. These differences from men make social capital more personable and impressionable to women audiences thus creating a stronger presence in regards to political engagement. A few examples of these characteristics are:
* Women&#x27;s informal and formal networks tend toward care work that is often considered apolitical.
* Women are also more likely to engage in local politics and social movement activities than in traditional forums focused on national politics.
* Women are more likely to organize themselves in less hierarchical ways and to focus on creating consensus.

The often informal nature of female social capital allows women to politicize apolitical environments without conforming to masculine standards, thus keeping this activity at a low public profile. These differences are hard to recognize within the discourse of political engagement and may explain why social capital has not been considered as a tool for female political engagement until as of late.

== Effects on health ==
A growing body of research has found that the presence of social capital through social networks and communities has a protective quality on health. Social capital affects health risk behavior in the sense that individuals who are embedded in a network or community rich in support, social trust, information, and norms, have resources that help achieve health goals. For example, a person who is sick with cancer may receive the information, money, or moral support needed to endure treatment and recover. Social capital also encourages social trust and membership. These factors can discourage individuals from engaging in risky health behaviors such as smoking and binge drinking.

Furthermore, neighbourhood social capital may also aid in buffering health inequities amongst children and adolescents. Social capital indicators such as neighbourhood cohesion, social support, and ties providing a bond between members of the same religion, have been found to be associated with better health despite financial or socioeconomic hardship. The function of social capital as a health buffer in circumstances of social disadvantage has also received attention in research on the health of minority ethnic populations. The relationships and networks that are maintained by an ethnic minority population in a geographical area where a high percentage of residents belong to the same ethnic group may lead to better health outcomes than would be expected based on other individual and neighbourhood characteristics. Such effects have been investigated in England, New Zealand, and the United States.

Inversely, a lack of social capital can impair health. For example, results from a survey given to 13- to 18-year-old students in Sweden showed that low social capital and low social trust are associated with higher rates of psychosomatic symptoms, musculoskeletal pain, and depression. Additionally, negative social capital can detract from health. Although there are only a few studies that assess social capital in criminalized populations, there is information that suggests that social capital does have a negative effect in broken communities. Deviant behavior is encouraged by deviant peers via favorable definitions and learning opportunities provided by network-based norms. However, in these same communities, an adjustment of norms (i.e. deviant peers being replaced by positive role models) can pose a positive effect.
Researchers have also investigated the hypothesis that the health benefits of social capital depend on the socioeconomic resources an individual or community has available to them. For example, social capital may boost health only for those with higher levels of education, or more so for those with a higher rather than a lower income. This research is based on Bourdieu&#x27;s notion that social, economic, and cultural capital are dependent on each other.

== Influence of the Internet ==
Similar to watching the news and keeping abreast of current events, the use of the Internet can relate to an individual&#x27;s level of social capital. In one study, informational uses of the Internet correlated positively with an individual&#x27;s production of social capital, and social-recreational uses were negatively correlated (higher levels of these uses correlated with lower levels of social capital). An example supporting the former argument is the contribution of Peter Maranci&#x27;s blog (&quot;Charlie on the Commuter Line&quot;) to address the train problems in Massachusetts. He created it after an incident where a lady passed out during a train ride due to the congestion in the train and help was delayed because of the congestion in the train and the inefficiency of the train conductor. His blog exposed the poor conditions of train stations, overcrowding train rides and inefficiency of the train conductor which eventually influenced changes within the transit system.

Another perspective holds that the rapid growth of social networking sites such as Facebook and Myspace suggests that individuals are creating a virtual-network consisting of both bonding and bridging social capital. Unlike face to face interaction, people can instantly connect with others in a targeted fashion by placing specific parameters with Internet use. This means that individuals can selectively connect with others based on ascertained interests, and backgrounds. Facebook is currently the most popular social networking site and touts many advantages to its users including serving as a &quot;social lubricant&quot; for individuals who otherwise have difficulties forming and maintaining both strong and weak ties with others.

This argument continues, although the preponderance of evidence shows a positive association between social capital and the Internet. Critics of virtual communities believe that the Internet replaces our strong bonds with online &quot;weak-ties&quot; or with socially empty interactions with the technology itself. Others fear that the Internet can create a world of &quot;narcissism of similarity,&quot; where sociability is reduced to interactions between those that are similar in terms of ideology, race, or gender. A few articles suggest that technologically based interactions has a negative relationship with social capital by displacing time spent engaging in geographical/ in-person social activities. However, the consensus of research shows that the more time people spend online the more in-person contact they have, thus positively enhancing social capital.

Recent research, conducted in 2006, also shows that Internet users often have wider networks than those who access the Internet irregularly or not at all. When not considering family and work contacts, Internet users actually tend to have contact with a higher number of friends and relatives. This is supported by another study that shows that Internet users and non-Internet users do feel equally close to the same number of people; also the Internet users maintain relationships with 20% more people whom they &quot;feel somewhat close&quot; to.

Other research shows that younger people use the Internet as a supplemental medium for communication, rather than letting the Internet communication replace face-to-face contact. This supports the view that Internet communication does not hinder development of social capital and does not make people feel lonelier than before.

Ellison, Steinfield &amp; Lampe (2007) suggest social capital exercised online is a result of relationships formed offline; whereby, bridging capital is enabled through a &quot;maintenance&quot; of relationships. Among respondents of this study, social capital built exclusively online creates weaker ties. A distinction of social bonding is offered by Ellison et al., 2007, suggesting bonds, or strong ties, are possible through social media, but less likely.

== Effects on educational achievement ==

=== Catholic schools (Coleman and Hoffer) ===
Coleman and Hoffer collected quantitative data of 28,000 students in total 1,015 public, Catholic and other private high schools in America from the 7 years&#x27; period from 1980 to 1987. It was found from this longitudinal research that social capital in students&#x27; families and communities attributed to the much lower dropout rates in Catholic schools compared with the higher rates in public.

Teachman et al. (1996) further develop the family structure indicator suggested by Coleman. They criticise Coleman, who used only the number of parents present in the family, neglected the unseen effect of more discrete dimensions such as stepparents&#x27; and different types of single-parent families. They take into account of a detailed counting of family structure, not only with two biological parents or stepparent families, but also with types of single-parent families with each other (mother-only, father-only, never-married, and other). They also contribute to the literature by measuring parent-child interaction by the indicators of how often parents and children discuss school-related activities.

Morgan and Sorensen (1999) directly challenge Coleman for his lacking of an explicit mechanism to explain why Catholic schools students perform better than public school students on standardised tests of achievement. Researching students in Catholic schools and public schools again, they propose two comparable models of social capital effect on mathematic learning. One is on Catholic schools as norm-enforcing schools whereas another is on public schools as horizon-expanding schools. It is found that while social capital can bring about positive effect of maintaining an encompassing functional community in norm-enforcing schools, it also brings about the negative consequence of excessive monitoring. Creativity and exceptional achievement would be repressed as a result. Whereas in horizon expanding school, social closure is found to be negative for student&#x27;s mathematic achievement. These schools explore a different type of social capital, such as information about opportunities in the extended social networks of parents and other adults. The consequence is that more learning is fostered than norm-enforcing Catholic school students. In sum, Morgan and Sorensen study implies that social capital is contextualised, one kind of social capital may be positive in this setting but is not necessarily still positive in another setting.

=== Community development ===
In the setting of education through Kilpatrick, Johns, and Mulford (2010) state that &quot;social capital is a useful lens for analysing lifelong learning and its relationship to community development.&quot; Social capital is particularly important in terms of education. Also the importance of education with &quot;schools being designed to create &#x27;functioning community&#x27; - forging tighter links between parents and the school&quot; linking that without this interaction, the social capital in this area is disadvantaged and demonstrates that social capital plays a major role in education.

=== Parental involvement ===
Putnam (2000) mentions in his book &quot;Bowling Alone&quot;, &quot;Child development is powerfully shaped by social capital&quot; and continues &quot;presence of social capital has been linked to various positive outcomes, particularly in education.&quot; According to his book, these positive outcomes are the result of parents&#x27; social capital in a community. In states where there is a high social capital, there is also a high education performance. The similarity of these states is that parents were more associated with their children&#x27;s education. Teachers have reported that when the parents participate more in their children&#x27;s education and school life, it lowers levels of misbehavior, such as bringing weapons to school, engaging in physical violence, unauthorized absence, and being generally apathetic about education. Borrowing Coleman&#x27;s quotation from Putnam&#x27;s book, Coleman once mentioned we cannot understate &quot;the importance of the embeddedness of young persons in the enclaves of adults most proximate to them, first and most prominent the family and second, a surrounding community of adults.&quot;

Without social capital in the area of education, teachers and parents who play a responsibility in a students learning, the significant impacts on their child&#x27;s academic learning can rely on these factors. With focus on parents contributing to their child&#x27;s academic progress as well as being influenced by social capital in education. Without the contribution by the parent in their child&#x27;s education, gives parents less opportunity and participation in the student&#x27;s life. As Tedin and Weiher (2010) state, &quot;one of the most important factors in promoting student success is the active involvement of parents in a child&#x27;s education.&quot; With parents also involved in activities and meetings the school conducts, the more involved parents are with other parents and the staff members. Thus parent involvement contributes to social capital with becoming more involved in the school community and participating makes the school a sustainable and easy to run community.

Sampson et al. (1999) stress the normative or goal-directed dimension of social capital, claiming that &quot;resources or networks alone (e.g. voluntary associations, friendship ties, organisational density) are neutral---they may or may not be effective mechanism for achieving intended effect.&quot;

=== Difference in male and female ===
Marjoribanks and Kwok (1998) conducted a survey in Hong Kong secondary schools with 387 fourteen-year-old students with an aim to analyse female and male adolescents differential educational achievement by using social capital as the main analytic tool. In that research, social capital is approved of its different effects upon different genders.

=== Adaption and ethnic values ===
In his thesis &quot;New Arrival Students in Hong Kong: Adaptation and School Performance&quot;, Hei Hang Hayes Tang (2002) argues that adaptation is a process of activation and accumulation of (cultural and social) capitals. The research findings show that supportive networks is the key determinant differentiating the divergent adaptation pathways. Supportive networks, as a form of social capital, is necessary for activating the cultural capital the newly arrived students possessed. The amount of accumulated capital is also relevant to further advancement in the ongoing adaptation process.

Min Zhou and Carl L. Bankston (1998), in their study of a Vietnamese community in New Orleans, found that preserving traditional ethnic values enable immigrants to integrate socially and to maintain solidarity in an ethnic community. Ethnic solidarity is especially important in the context where immigrants just arrive in the host society. In her article &quot;Social Capital in Chinatown&quot;, Zhou examines how the process of adaptation of young Chinese Americans is affected by tangible forms of social relations between the community, immigrant families, and the younger generations. Chinatown serves as the basis of social capital that facilitates the accommodation of immigrant children in the expected directions. Ethnic support provides impetus to academic success. Furthermore, maintenance of literacy in native language also provides a form of social capital that contributes positively to academic achievement. Stanton-Salazar and Dornbusch found that bilingual students were more likely to obtain the necessary forms of institutional support to advance their school performance and their life chances.

== In fields of study ==
=== Geography ===
In order to understand social capital as a subject in geography, one must look at it in a sense of space, place, and territory. In its relationship, the tenets of geography relate to the ideas of social capital in the family, community, and in the use of social networks. The biggest advocate for seeing social capital as a geographical subject was American economist and political scientist Robert Putnam. His main argument for classifying social capital as a geographical concept is that the relationships of people is shaped and molded by the areas in which they live.

There are many areas in which social capital can be defined by the theories and practices. In 1984, Anthony Giddens developed a theory in which he relates social structures and the actions that they produce. In his studies, he does not look at the individual participants of these structures, but how the structures and the social connections that stem from them are diffused over space. If this is the case, the continuous change in social structures could bring about a change in social capital, which can cause changes in community atmosphere. If an area is plagued by social organizations whose goals are to revolt against social norms, such as gangs, it can cause a negative social capital for the area causing those who disagreed with these organizations to relocate thus taking their positive social capital to a different space than the negative.

Another area where social capital can be seen as an area of study in geography is through the analysis of participation in volunteerism and its support of different governments. One area to look into with this is through those who participate in social organizations. People that participate are of different races, ages, and economic status. With these in mind, variances of the space in which these different demographics may vary, causing a difference in involvement among areas. Secondly, there are different social programs for different areas based on economic situation. A governmental organization would not place a welfare center in a wealthier neighborhood where it would have very limited support to the community, as it is not needed. Thirdly, social capital can be affected by the participation of individuals of a certain area based on the type of institutions that are placed there. Mohan supports this with the argument of J. Fox in his paper &quot;Decentralization and Rural Development in Mexico&quot;, which states &quot;structures of local governance in turn influence the capacity of grassroots communities to influence social investments.&quot; With this theory, if the involvement of a government in specific areas raises the involvement of individuals in social organizations and/or communities, this will in turn raise the social capital for that area. Since every area is different, the government takes that into consideration and will provide different areas with different institutions to fit their needs thus there will be different changes in social capital in different areas.

=== Leisure studies ===
In the context of leisure studies, social capital is seen as the consequence of investment in and cultivation of social relationships allowing an individual access to resources that would otherwise be unavailable to him or her. The concept of social capital in relation to leisure is grounded in a perspective that emphasizes the interconnectedness rather than the separateness of human activity and human goals. There is a significant connection between leisure and democratic social capital. Specific forms of leisure activity contribute to the development of the social capital central to democracy and democratic citizenship. The more an individual participates in social activities, the more autonomy the individual experiences, which will help her or his individual abilities and skills to develop. The greater the accumulation of social capital a person experiences, may transfer to other leisure activities as well as personal social roles, relationships and in other roles within a social structure.

=== Social capital, marriage, and romantic relationships ===
Kislev (2019) shows that following vast changes to the status of marriage in modern society singles present higher social capital. They also derive greater happiness from equal levels of social capital compared with married people. In a later study, Kislev (2020) shows the relation between romantic relationships desire and singleness. He shows that a lower degree of relationship desire has a significant effect on the relative importance of friends. Furthermore, both higher levels of the relative importance of friends and social satisfaction are negatively correlated with relationship desire.

== Effects on informal economies ==
Social capital has been associated with the reduction in access to informal credit in informal economies (especially in developing countries). Mwangi and Ouma (2012) ran a bivariate probit model on financial access national survey data to the impact of social capital on financial inclusion in Kenya. They determined that membership to groups increased one&#x27;s probability of getting an informal loan by 1.45% and also the more group memberships one held, the more likely they were to access an informal loan.

Similar results were revealed in a cross-sectional study run by Sarker in Bangladesh. Some other authors also note the importance of social capital among female entrepreneurship. Epo (2013) presented the case that social capital and micro loans increase the likelihood of female entrepreneurship in Cameroon. Epo did this by comparing the welfare outcomes of the entrepreneurs who both had access and no access. Other authors, however, disagree about the positive correlation between social capital and microfinance, Kanak and Iiguni argue that formation of social capital is largely dependent on strategies implemented by Microfinance Institutions. Kanak and Iiguni determined this while investigating social capital formation in a rural village in Bangladesh.

<text>Individual capital, the economic view of talent, comprises inalienable or personal traits of persons, tied to their bodies and available only through their own free will, such as skill, creativity, enterprise, courage, capacity for moral example, non-communicable wisdom, invention or empathy, non-transferable personal trust and leadership.

== As recognized in theories of economics ==

Individual talent and initiative was recognized as an intangible quality of persons in economics back to at least Adam Smith. He distinguished it (as &quot;enterprise&quot;) from labour which can be coerced and is usually seen as strictly imitative (learned or transmitted, via such means as apprenticeship).

Marxist economics refers instead to &quot;an individual&#x27;s social capital—individuals are sources neither of creativity and innovation, nor management skill. A problem with that analysis is that it simply cannot explain the substitution problem and lack of demand that occurs when, for instance, an understudy takes on a leading role, or a second author takes over writing a popular book series. At the very least there must be some conditional, if not firm-specific then &quot;class specific&quot;, special ability to command premiums for outstanding personal performance.

Neoclassical economics by contrast refers to &quot;the individual in whom the human capital is ... embedded&quot;, which implies a strong association of the individual with the instructional capital they learn from, with little or no social capital influence. This is orthogonal to the Marxist view, but not necessarily opposed.

Human development theory reflects both distinctions: it sees labour as the yield of individual capital in the same way that neoclassical macro-economics sees financial capital as the yield of the looser idea of human capital. But the rest problem and social welfare function selection, as well as the subjective factors in behavioral finance, has led to a closer analysis of factors of production. In effect, the financial architecture is no longer trusted as an arbiter of the value of life as it was in neoclassical economics. Money is not seen as values-neutral, but as embodying a set of larger social choices about money supply rules, made by measuring well-being of whole populations.

== Versus &quot;human&quot;, &quot;firm-specific&quot;, &quot;individual social&quot; ==

While conflated in many analyses with human capital, the latter term includes social capital (human relationships) and instructional capital (abstract texts and training materials and so on) that are not tied to any one person, do not die with them or leave employment with them, and therefore cannot be equated with talent alone. In intangibles measurement, value creation and value reporting metrics require all assets with such different characteristics to be categorized as different capital assets, so the more exact reference to the individual person is preferred.

Fusions of terminology are common. Sociological analysts refer to &quot;individual-level elements of social capital&quot; or &quot;an individual&#x27;s social capital&quot; or just &quot;individual social capital&quot; while economic analysts often use the phrase firm-specific human capital. In either case the clearly includes individual capital but also some &quot;activity-&quot;, &quot;community-&quot; or &quot;firm-specific&quot; social capital (community trust) and instructional capital (shareable knowledge or skills). This is easy to measure: its yield is your salary in your current job.

To the degree this is consistent if you take other work nearby, this opens the questions of what is &quot;not&quot; &quot;firm-specific&quot; and whether a nation is just a bigger &quot;firm&quot;: Some analyses see political capital, or just &quot;influence&quot; or &quot;trust of professionals&quot; as a full style of capital of its own. Some ethicists, most clearly Jane Jacobs, see this as simple corruption. Nonetheless, corruption clearly has a cash value, involves some creativity to arrange, and is a decision factor. It is a skill like any other.

== Versus &quot;intellectual capital&quot; ==

Perhaps because of this, not all theorists recognize individual capital as being as essential as labour, or distinct from social or political influence, or from instructional capacity. These theorists often refer to &quot;intellectual capital&quot;, which more properly describes a debate or locus of complexity that arises when individuals take key instructional roles. Some refer to celebrity as another fusion, when individuals take key social roles.

However, a great many celebrities are clearly not &quot;intellectual&quot; achievers nor notable for any cognitive or analytic powers, e.g. Kim Kardashian, professional sports figures or other athletes. While they may through sheer exposure become involved in causes or controversies (as Paris Hilton did in the US presidential election, 2008) it&#x27;s clearly not correct to label all individually unique talent or economic value as being an &quot;intellectual&quot; asset.

This failure to distinguish individual&#x27;s objectively observed economic value (the power to promote or publicize products, draw attention to causes, etc.) from the &quot;intellectual&quot; powers is probably an elitist bias. Clearly, there are some individuals, including non-humans such as a racehorse, which have economic value unique to their individual body and being that cannot be captured or defined as an &quot;intellectual&quot; asset nor as a set of &quot;social&quot; relationships (because horses do not socialize in the sense humans do). Where slavery exists or has existed, there is clearly a value put on living bodies separate from their instructional or social selves.

Thus for analyzing historical or criminal economic activities, or even professional sports, the instructional capital vs. individual capital vs. social capital distinction is essential.

== Investment ==
Those who differentiate individual capital tend to see it as something that one can invest in, directly, and see growth, directly. For individual skill, even skill at a highly imitative enterprise, like sports or mastery of a musical instrument, this is very often quite measurable. Many enterprises, for instance, a music conservatory or circus school or creative writing coach, are clearly making a living on the identification and (somewhat) measurable enhancement of the individual.
