<text>Like the year 2020, 2021 was also heavily defined by the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the emergence of multiple COVID-19 variants. The major global rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, which began at the end of 2020, continued in 2021. Most major events scheduled for 2020 that were postponed due to the pandemic were hosted in 2021, including the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, Expo 2020, and sporting events such as UEFA Euro 2020, the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, as well as the 2021 Copa América. 

2021 additionally witnessed numerous advancements in space exploration, particularly by the United Arab Emirates, NASA and SpaceX, including the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope.

Civil unrest grew in 2021, with coups occurring in Sudan, Myanmar, Mali and Guinea, and insurrections occurring in Armenia and the United States.

<text>In engineering, applied mathematics, and physics, the Buckingham theorem is a key theorem in dimensional analysis. It is a formalisation of Rayleigh&#x27;s method of dimensional analysis. Loosely, the theorem states that if there is a physically meaningful equation involving a certain number &quot;n&quot; physical variables, then the original equation can be rewritten in terms of a set of &quot;p&quot; = &quot;n&quot; − &quot;k&quot; dimensionless parameters 1, 2, ..., &quot;p&quot; constructed from the original variables, where &quot;k&quot; is the number of physical dimensions involved; it is obtained as the rank of a particular matrix.

The theorem provides a method for computing sets of dimensionless parameters from the given variables, or nondimensionalization, even if the form of the equation is still unknown.

The Buckingham theorem indicates that validity of the laws of physics does not depend on a specific unit system. A statement of this theorem is that any physical law can be expressed as an identity involving only dimensionless combinations (ratios or products) of the variables linked by the law (for example, pressure and volume are linked by Boyle&#x27;s law – they are inversely proportional). If the dimensionless combinations&#x27; values changed with the systems of units, then the equation would not be an identity, and the theorem would not hold.

== History ==

Although named for Edgar Buckingham, the theorem was first proved by the French mathematician Joseph Bertrand in 1878. Bertrand considered only special cases of problems from electrodynamics and heat conduction, but his article contains, in distinct terms, all the basic ideas of the modern proof of the theorem and clearly indicates the theorem&#x27;s utility for modelling physical phenomena. The technique of using the theorem (&quot;the method of dimensions&quot;) became widely known due to the works of Rayleigh. The first application of the theorem &quot;in the general case&quot; to the dependence of pressure drop in a pipe upon governing parameters probably dates back to 1892, a heuristic proof with the use of series expansions, to 1894.

Formal generalization of the theorem for the case of arbitrarily many quantities was given first by in 1892, then in 1911—apparently independently—by both A. Federman and D. Riabouchinsky, and again in 1914 by Buckingham. It was Buckingham&#x27;s article that introduced the use of the symbol &quot;formula_1&quot; for the dimensionless variables (or parameters), and this is the source of the theorem&#x27;s name.

== Statement ==
More formally, the number formula_2 of dimensionless terms that can be formed is equal to the nullity of the dimensional matrix, and formula_3 is the rank. For experimental purposes, different systems that share the same description in terms of these dimensionless numbers are equivalent.

In mathematical terms, if we have a physically meaningful equation such as
formula_4
where formula_5 are any formula_6 physical variables, and there is a maximal dimensionally independent subset of size formula_3, then the above equation can be restated as
formula_8
where formula_9 are dimensionless parameters constructed from the formula_10 by formula_11 dimensionless equations — the so-called &quot;Pi groups&quot; — of the form
formula_12
where the exponents formula_13 are rational numbers. (They can always be taken to be integers by redefining formula_1 as being raised to a power that clears all denominators.) If there are formula_15 fundamental units in play, then formula_16.

== Significance ==
The Buckingham theorem provides a method for computing sets of dimensionless parameters from given variables, even if the form of the equation remains unknown. However, the choice of dimensionless parameters is not unique; Buckingham&#x27;s theorem only provides a way of generating sets of dimensionless parameters and does not indicate the most &quot;physically meaningful&quot;.

Two systems for which these parameters coincide are called &quot;similar&quot; (as with similar triangles, they differ only in scale); they are equivalent for the purposes of the equation, and the experimentalist who wants to determine the form of the equation can choose the most convenient one. Most importantly, Buckingham&#x27;s theorem describes the relation between the number of variables and fundamental dimensions.

== Proof ==

For simplicity, it will be assumed that the space of fundamental and derived physical units forms a vector space over the real numbers, with the fundamental units as basis vectors, and with multiplication of physical units as the &quot;vector addition&quot; operation, and raising to powers as the &quot;scalar multiplication&quot; operation:
represent a dimensional variable as the set of exponents needed for the fundamental units (with a power of zero if the particular fundamental unit is not present). For instance, the standard gravity formula_17 has units of formula_18 (length over time squared), so it is represented as the vector formula_19 with respect to the basis of fundamental units (length, time). We could also require that exponents of the fundamental units be rational numbers and modify the proof accordingly, in which case the exponents in the pi groups can always be taken as rational numbers or even integers.

=== Rescaling units ===
Suppose we have quantities formula_20, where the units of formula_10 contain length raised to the power formula_22. If we originally measure length in meters but later switch to centimeters, then the numerical value of formula_10 would be rescaled by a factor of formula_24. Any physically meaningful law should be invariant under an arbitrary rescaling of every fundamental unit; this is the fact that the pi theorem hinges on. 

=== Formal proof ===
Given a system of formula_6 dimensional variables formula_5 in formula_15 fundamental (basis) dimensions, the &quot;dimensional matrix&quot; is the formula_28 matrix formula_29 whose formula_15 rows correspond to the fundamental dimensions and whose formula_6 columns are the dimensions of the variables: the formula_32th entry (where formula_33 and formula_34) is the power of the formula_35th fundamental dimension in the formula_36th variable. 
The matrix can be interpreted as taking in a combination of the variable quantities and giving out the dimensions of the combination in terms of the fundamental dimensions. So the formula_37 (column) vector that results from the multiplication
formula_38
consists of the units of
formula_39
in terms of the formula_15 fundamental independent (basis) units.

If we rescale the formula_35th fundamental unit by a factor of formula_42, then formula_43 gets rescaled by formula_44, where formula_45 is the formula_32th entry of the dimensional matrix. In order to convert this into a linear algebra problem, we take logarithms (the base is irrelevant), yielding formula_47 which is an action of formula_48 on formula_49. We define a physical law to be an arbitrary function formula_50 such that formula_51 is a permissible set of values for the physical system when formula_52. We further require formula_53 to be invariant under this action. Hence it descends to a function formula_54. All that remains is to exhibit an isomorphism between formula_55 and formula_56, the (log) space of pi groups formula_57.

We construct an formula_58 matrix formula_59 whose columns are a basis for formula_60. It tells us how to embed formula_56 into formula_49 as the kernel of formula_29. That is, we have an exact sequence
:formula_64
Taking tranposes yields another exact sequence
:formula_65

The first isomorphism theorem produces the desired isomorphism, which sends the coset formula_66 to formula_67. This corresponds to rewriting the tuple formula_68 into the pi groups formula_69 coming from the columns of formula_59.

The International System of Units defines seven base units, which are the ampere, kelvin, second, metre, kilogram, candela and mole. It is sometimes advantageous to introduce additional base units and techniques to refine the technique of dimensional analysis. (See orientational analysis and reference.)

== Examples ==

=== Speed ===
This example is elementary but serves to demonstrate the procedure.

Suppose a car is driving at 100 km/h; how long does it take to go 200 km?

This question considers formula_71 dimensioned variables: distance formula_72 time formula_73 and speed formula_74 and we are seeking some law of the form formula_75 Any two of these variables are dimensionally independent, but the three taken together are not. Thus there is formula_76 dimensionless quantity.

The dimensional matrix is
formula_77
in which the rows correspond to the basis dimensions formula_78 and formula_79 and the columns to the considered dimensions formula_80 where the latter stands for the speed dimension. The elements of the matrix correspond to the powers to which the respective dimensions are to be raised. For instance, the third column formula_81 states that formula_82 represented by the column vector formula_83 is expressible in terms of the basis dimensions as formula_84 since formula_85

For a dimensionless constant formula_86 we are looking for vectors formula_87 such that the matrix-vector product formula_88 equals the zero vector formula_89 In linear algebra, the set of vectors with this property is known as the kernel (or nullspace) of the dimensional matrix. In this particular case its kernel is one-dimensional. The dimensional matrix as written above is in reduced row echelon form, so one can read off a non-zero kernel vector to within a multiplicative constant:
formula_90

If the dimensional matrix were not already reduced, one could perform Gauss–Jordan elimination on the dimensional matrix to more easily determine the kernel. It follows that the dimensionless constant, replacing the dimensions by the corresponding dimensioned variables, may be written:
formula_91

Since the kernel is only defined to within a multiplicative constant, the above dimensionless constant raised to any arbitrary power yields another (equivalent) dimensionless constant.

Dimensional analysis has thus provided a general equation relating the three physical variables:
formula_92
or, letting formula_93 denote a zero of function formula_94
formula_95
which can be written in the desired form (which recall was formula_96) as
formula_97

The actual relationship between the three variables is simply formula_98 In other words, in this case formula_99 has one physically relevant root, and it is unity. The fact that only a single value of formula_93 will do and that it is equal to 1 is not revealed by the technique of dimensional analysis.

===The simple pendulum===
We wish to determine the period formula_101 of small oscillations in a simple pendulum. It will be assumed that it is a function of the length formula_102 the mass formula_103 and the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Earth formula_104 which has dimensions of length divided by time squared. The model is of the form
formula_105

(Note that it is written as a relation, not as a function: formula_101 is not written here as a function of formula_107)

Period, mass, and length are dimensionally independent, but acceleration can be expressed in terms of time and length, which means the four variables taken together are not dimensionally independent. Thus we need only formula_108 dimensionless parameter, denoted by formula_109 and the model can be re-expressed as
formula_110
where formula_111 is given by
formula_112
for some values of formula_113

The dimensions of the dimensional quantities are:
formula_114

The dimensional matrix is:
formula_115

(The rows correspond to the dimensions formula_116 and formula_117 and the columns to the dimensional variables formula_118 For instance, the 4th column, formula_119 states that the formula_17 variable has dimensions of formula_121)

We are looking for a kernel vector formula_122 such that the matrix product of formula_123 on formula_124 yields the zero vector formula_125 The dimensional matrix as written above is in reduced row echelon form, so one can read off a kernel vector within a multiplicative constant:
formula_126

Were it not already reduced, one could perform Gauss–Jordan elimination on the dimensional matrix to more easily determine the kernel. It follows that the dimensionless constant may be written:
formula_127
In fundamental terms:
formula_128
which is dimensionless. Since the kernel is only defined to within a multiplicative constant, if the above dimensionless constant is raised to any arbitrary power, it will yield another equivalent dimensionless constant.

In this example, three of the four dimensional quantities are fundamental units, so the last (which is formula_17) must be a combination of the previous. 
Note that if formula_130 (the coefficient of formula_29) had been non-zero then there would be no way to cancel the formula_29 value; therefore formula_130 be zero. Dimensional analysis has allowed us to conclude that the period of the pendulum is not a function of its mass formula_134 (In the 3D space of powers of mass, time, and distance, we can say that the vector for mass is linearly independent from the vectors for the three other variables. Up to a scaling factor, formula_135 is the only nontrivial way to construct a vector of a dimensionless parameter.)

The model can now be expressed as:
formula_136

Then this implies that formula_137 for some zero formula_138 of the function formula_139 If there is only one zero, call it formula_140 then formula_141 It requires more physical insight or an experiment to show that there is indeed only one zero and that the constant is in fact given by formula_142

For large oscillations of a pendulum, the analysis is complicated by an additional dimensionless parameter, the maximum swing angle. The above analysis is a good approximation as the angle approaches zero.

=== Electric power ===
To demonstrate the application of the theorem, consider the power consumption of a stirrer with a given shape.
The power, &quot;P&quot;, in dimensions [M · L2/T3], is a function of the density, &quot;ρ&quot; [M/L3], and the viscosity of the fluid to be stirred, &quot;μ&quot; [M/(L · T)], as well as the size of the stirrer given by its diameter, &quot;D&quot; [L], and the angular speed of the stirrer, &quot;n&quot; [1/T]. Therefore, we have a total of &quot;n&quot; = 5 variables representing our example. Those &quot;n&quot; = 5 variables are built up from &quot;k&quot; = 3 independent dimensions, e.g., length: L (SI units: m), time: T (s), and mass: M (kg).

According to the -theorem, the &quot;n&quot; = 5 variables can be reduced by the &quot;k&quot; = 3 dimensions to form &quot;p&quot; = &quot;n&quot; − &quot;k&quot; = 5 − 3 = 2 independent dimensionless numbers. Usually, these quantities are chosen as formula_143, commonly named the Reynolds number which describes the fluid flow regime, and formula_144, the power number, which is the dimensionless description of the stirrer.

Note that the two dimensionless quantities are not unique and depend on which of the &quot;n&quot; = 5 variables are chosen as the &quot;k&quot; = 3 dimensionally independent basis variables, which, in this example, appear in both dimensionless quantities. The Reynolds number and power number fall from the above analysis if formula_145, &quot;n&quot;, and &quot;D&quot; are chosen to be the basis variables. If, instead, formula_146, &quot;n&quot;, and &quot;D&quot; are selected, the Reynolds number is recovered while the second dimensionless quantity becomes formula_147. We note that formula_148 is the product of the Reynolds number and the power number.

===Other examples===

An example of dimensional analysis can be found for the case of the mechanics of a thin, solid and parallel-sided rotating disc. There are five variables involved which reduce to two non-dimensional groups. The relationship between these can be determined by numerical experiment using, for example, the finite element method.

The theorem has also been used in fields other than physics, for instance in sports science.

For a concrete example, suppose that the formula_149 fundamental units are meters formula_150 and seconds formula_151 and that there are formula_71 dimensional variables: formula_153 By definition of vector addition and scalar multiplication of units,
formula_154
so that 
formula_155 
By definition, the dimensionless variables are those whose units are formula_156 which are exactly the vectors in 
formula_157 
This can be verified by a direct computation: 
formula_158
which is indeed dimensionless. 
Consequently, if some physical law states that formula_159 are necessarily related by a (presumably unknown) equation of the form formula_160 for some (unknown) function formula_53 with formula_162 (that is, the tuple formula_163 is necessarily a zero of formula_53), then there exists some (also unknown) function formula_165 that depends on only formula_166 variable, the dimensionless variable formula_167 (or any non-zero rational power formula_168 of formula_169 where formula_170), such that formula_171 holds (if formula_168 is used instead of formula_173 then formula_99 can be replaced with formula_175 and once again formula_176 holds). 
Thus in terms of the original variables, formula_177 must hold (alternatively, if using formula_178 for instance, then formula_179 must hold). 
In other words, the Buckingham theorem implies that formula_180 so that if it happens to be the case that this formula_99 has exactly one zero, call it formula_140 then the equation formula_183 will necessarily hold (the theorem does not give information about what the exact value of the constant formula_93 will be, nor does it guarantee that formula_99 has exactly one zero).

<text>The Low Countries (; ), historically also known as the Netherlands (), is a coastal lowland region in Northwestern Europe forming the lower basin of the Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta and consisting today of the three modern &quot;Benelux&quot; countries: Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands (, which is singular). Geographically and historically, the area can also include parts of France (such as Nord and Pas-de-Calais) and the German regions of East Frisia, Guelders and Cleves. During the Middle Ages, the Low Countries were divided into numerous semi-independent principalities.

Historically, the regions without access to the sea linked themselves politically and economically to those with access to form various unions of ports and hinterland, stretching inland as far as parts of the German Rhineland. Because of this, nowadays not only physically low-altitude areas, but also some hilly or elevated regions are considered part of the Low Countries, including Luxembourg and the south of Belgium. Within the European Union, the region&#x27;s political grouping is still referred to as the Benelux (short for Belgium-Netherlands-Luxembourg).

During the Roman Empire, the region contained a militarised frontier and contact point between Rome and Germanic tribes. The Low Countries were the scene of the early independent trading centres that marked the reawakening of Europe in the 12th century. In that period, they rivalled northern Italy as one of the most densely populated regions of Western Europe. Guilds and councils governed most of the cities along with a figurehead ruler; interaction with their ruler was regulated by a strict set of rules describing what the latter could and could not expect. All of the regions mainly depended on trade, manufacturing and the encouragement of the free flow of goods and craftsmen. Dutch and French dialects were the main languages used in secular city life.

==Terminology==

Historically, the term &quot;Low Countries&quot; arose at the Court of the Dukes of Burgundy, who used the term &#x27; (&quot;the lands over here&quot;) for the Low Countries as opposed to &#x27; (&quot;the lands over there&quot;) for the Duchy of Burgundy and the Free County of Burgundy, which were part of their realm but geographically disconnected from the Low Countries. Governor Mary of Hungary used both the expressions &#x27; and &#x27; (&quot;lands down here&quot;), which evolved to &quot;&quot; or &quot;Low Countries&quot;. Today the term is typically fitted to modern political boundaries and used in the same way as the term &quot;Benelux&quot;.

The name of the country of the Netherlands has the same etymology and origin as the name for the region Low Countries, due to &quot;nether&quot; meaning &quot;low&quot;. In the Dutch language itself is the modern term for Low Countries, and &quot;De Nederlanden&quot; (plural) is in use for the 16th century domains of Charles V, the historic Low Countries, while &quot;Nederland&quot; (singular) is the normal Dutch name for the country of the Netherlands. However, in official use, the name of the Dutch kingdom is still Kingdom of the Netherlands, (plural). This name derives from the 19th-century origins of the kingdom which originally included present-day Belgium.

In Dutch, and to a lesser extent in English, the Low Countries colloquially means the Netherlands and Belgium, sometimes the Netherlands and Flanders—the Dutch-speaking north of Belgium. For example, a &quot;&quot; (&quot;Derby der Lage Landen&quot;), is a sports event between Belgium and the Netherlands.

Belgium separated in 1830 from the (northern) Netherlands. The new country took its name from &quot;Belgica&quot;, the Latinised name for the Low Countries, as it was known during the Eighty Years&#x27; War (1568–1648). The Low Countries were in that war divided in two parts. On one hand, the northern Federated Netherlands or &quot;Belgica Foederata&quot; rebelled against King Philip II of Spain; on the other, the southern Royal Netherlands or &quot;Belgica Regia&quot; remained loyal to the Spanish king. This divide laid the early foundation for the later modern states of Belgium and the Netherlands.

== History ==
The region politically had its origins in the Carolingian empire; more precisely, most of the people were within the Duchy of Lower Lotharingia. After the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia, the Low Countries were brought under the rule of various lordships until they came to be in the hands of the Valois Dukes of Burgundy. Hence, a large part of the Low Countries came to be referred to as the Burgundian Netherlands. After the reign of the Valois Dukes ended, much of the Low Countries were controlled by the House of Habsburg. This area was referred to as the Habsburg Netherlands, which was also called the Seventeen Provinces up to 1581. Even after the political secession of the autonomous Dutch Republic (or &quot;United Provinces&quot;) in the north, the term &quot;Low Countries&quot; continued to be used to refer collectively to the region. The region was temporarily united politically between 1815 and 1839, as the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, before this split into the three modern countries of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.

===Early history===

The Low Countries were part of the Roman provinces of Gallia Belgica and Germania Inferior. They were inhabited by Belgic and Germanic tribes. In the 4th and 5th century, Frankish tribes had entered this Roman region and came to run it increasingly independently. They came to be ruled by the Merovingian dynasty, under which dynasty the southern part (below the Rhine) was re-Christianised.

===Frankish Empire===

By the end of the 8th century, the Low Countries formed a core part of a much expanded Francia and the Merovingians were replaced by the Carolingian dynasty. In 800, the Pope crowned and appointed Charlemagne Emperor of the re-established Roman Empire.

After the death of Charlemagne, Francia was divided in three parts among his three grandsons. The middle slice, Middle Francia, was ruled by Lothair I, and thereby also came to be referred to as &quot;Lotharingia&quot; or &quot;Lorraine&quot;. Apart from the original coastal County of Flanders, which was within West Francia, the rest of the Low Countries were within the lowland part of this, &quot;Lower Lorraine&quot;.

After the death of Lothair, the Low Countries were coveted by the rulers of both West Francia and East Francia. Each tried to swallow the region and to merge it with their spheres of influence. Thus, the Low Countries consisted of fiefs whose sovereignty resided with either the Kingdom of France or the Holy Roman Empire. While the further history the Low Countries can be seen as the object of a continual struggle between these two powers, the title of Duke of Lothier was coveted in the low countries for centuries.

===Duchy of Burgundy===

In the 14th and 15th century, separate fiefs came gradually to be ruled by a single family through royal intermarriage. This process culminated in the rule of the House of Valois, who were the rulers of the Duchy of Burgundy. At the height of Burgundian influence, the Low Countries became the political, cultural, and economic centre of Northern Europe, noted for its crafts and luxury goods, notably early Netherlandish painting, which is the work of artists who were active in the flourishing cities of Bruges, Ghent, Mechelen, Leuven, Tournai and Brussels, all in present-day Belgium. Musicians of the Franco-Flemish School were highly sought by the leading classes of all Europe. 

===Seventeen Provinces===

In 1477 the Burgundian holdings in the area passed through an heiress—Mary of Burgundy—to the Habsburgs. Charles V, who inherited the territory in 1506, was named ruler by the States General and styled himself as &quot;Heer der Nederlanden&quot; (). He continued to rule the territories as a multitude of duchies and principalities until the Low Countries were eventually united into one indivisible territory, the Seventeen Provinces, covered by the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549, while retaining existing customs, laws, and forms of government within the provinces.

The Pragmatic Sanction transformed the agglomeration of lands into a unified entity, of which the Habsburgs would be the heirs. By streamlining the succession law in all Seventeen Provinces and declaring that all of them would be inherited by one heir, Charles effectively united the Netherlands as one entity. After Charles&#x27; abdication in 1555, the Seventeen Provinces passed to his son, Philip II of Spain.

===Division===

The Pragmatic Sanction is said to be one example of the Habsburg contest with particularism that contributed to the Dutch Revolt. Each of the provinces had its own laws, customs and political practices. The new policy, imposed from the outside, angered many inhabitants, who viewed their provinces as distinct entities. It and other monarchical acts, such as the creation of bishoprics and promulgation of laws against heresy, stoked resentments, which fired the eruption of the Dutch Revolt.

After the northern Seven United Provinces of the seventeen declared their independence from Habsburg Spain in 1581, the ten provinces of the Southern Netherlands remained occupied by the Army of Flanders under Spanish service and are therefore sometimes called the Spanish Netherlands. In 1713, under the Treaty of Utrecht following the War of the Spanish Succession, what was left of the Spanish Netherlands was ceded to Austria and thus became known as the Austrian Netherlands.

===Modern period===

The United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815–1830) temporarily united the Low Countries again before it split into the three modern countries of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.

During the early months of World War I (around 1914), the Central Powers invaded the Low Countries of Luxembourg and Belgium in what has been come to be known as the German invasion of Belgium. It led to the German occupation of the two countries. However, the German advance into France was quickly halted, causing a military stalemate for most of the war. In the end, a total of approximately 56,000 people were killed in the invasion.

During World War II, when Adolf Hitler&#x27;s gaze turned his strategy west toward France, the Low Countries were an easy route around the imposing French Maginot Line. He ordered a conquest of the Low Countries with the shortest possible notice, to forestall the French, and prevent Allied air power from threatening the strategic Ruhr Area of Germany. It would also provide the basis for a long-term air and sea campaign against Britain. As much as possible of the border areas in northern France should be occupied. Germany&#x27;s Blitzkrieg tactics rapidly overpowered the defences of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

All three countries were occupied from May 1940 until early 1945. During the occupation, their governments were forced into exile in Britain. In 1944, they signed the London Customs Convention, laying the foundation for the eventual Benelux Economic Union, an important forerunner of the EEC (later the EU).

==Literature==
One of the Low Countries&#x27; earliest literary figures is the blind poet Bernlef, from , who sang both Christian psalms and pagan verses. Bernlef is representative of the coexistence of Christianity and Germanic polytheism in this time period.

The earliest examples of written literature include the Wachtendonck Psalms, a collection of twenty five psalms that originated in the Moselle-Frankish region around the middle of the 9th century.

<doc id="51408" wikidata="Q925252" url="?curid=51408" title="Half Dome">
<text>Half Dome is a quartz monzonite batholith at the eastern end of Yosemite Valley in Yosemite National Park, California. It is a well-known rock formation in the park, named for its distinct shape. One side is a sheer face while the other three sides are smooth and round, making it appear like a dome cut in half. It stands at nearly 8,800 feet above sea level and is composed of quartz monzonite, an igneous rock that solidified several thousand feet within the Earth. At its core are the remains of a magma chamber that cooled slowly and crystallized beneath the Earth&#x27;s surface. The solidified magma chamber was then exposed and cut in half by erosion, therefore leading to the geographic name Half Dome.

==Geology==
The impression from the valley floor that this is a round dome that has lost its northwest half, is just an illusion. From Washburn Point, Half Dome can be seen as a thin ridge of rock, an arête, that is oriented northeast–southwest, with its southeast side almost as steep as its northwest side except for the very top. Although the trend of this ridge, as well as that of Tenaya Canyon, is probably controlled by master joints, 80 percent of the northwest &quot;half&quot; of the original dome may well still be there.

==Ascents==

As late as the 1870s, Half Dome was described as &quot;perfectly inaccessible&quot; by Josiah Whitney of the California Geological Survey. The summit was reached by George Anderson in October 1875, via a route constructed by drilling and placing iron eye bolts into the smooth rock. Anderson had previously tried a variety of methods, including using pitch from nearby pine trees for extra friction.

Anderson subsequently went on to add ropes to his eye bolts, so that other people could climb. Among those who took advantage was the first woman to climb Half Dome in 1876, S. L. Dutcher, of San Francisco. In 1877 James Mason Hutchings along with Anderson led a climb which included Hutchings&#x27; daughter Cosie, his son Willie, his mother-in-law Florence Sproat, aged 65, and two other women.

Today, Half Dome may be ascended in several different ways. Thousands of hikers reach the top each year by following an trail from the valley floor. After a rigorous approach, including several hundred feet of rock stairs, the final pitch up the peak&#x27;s steep but somewhat rounded east face is ascended with the aid of a pair of post-mounted steel cables originally constructed close to the Anderson route in 1919.

Alternatively, over a dozen rock climbing routes lead from the valley up Half Dome&#x27;s vertical northwest face. The first technical ascent was in 1957 via a route pioneered by Royal Robbins, Mike Sherrick, and Jerry Gallwas, today known as the Regular Northwest Face. Their five-day epic was the first Grade VI climb in the United States. Their route has now been free climbed several times in a few hours&#x27; time. Other technical routes ascend the south face and the west shoulder.

==Hiking the Cable Route==

The Half Dome Cable Route hike runs from the valley floor to the top of the dome in (via the Mist Trail), with of elevation gain. The length and difficulty of the trail used to keep it less crowded than other park trails, but trail traffic grew to as many as 1,000 people a day, and about 50,000 per year, before a permit system was introduced in 2010. The hike can be done from the valley floor in a single long day, but many people break it up by camping overnight in Little Yosemite Valley. The trail climbs past Vernal Fall and Nevada Fall, then continues into Little Yosemite Valley, then north to the base of the northeast ridge of Half Dome itself.

The final ascent is steeply up the rock between two steel cables used as handholds. The cables are fixed with bolts in the rock and raised onto a series of metal poles in late May. The poles do not anchor the cables. The cables are taken down from the poles for the winter in early October, but they are still fixed to the rock surface and can be used. The National Park Service recommends against climbing the route when the cables are down, or when the surface of the rock is wet and slippery. The &quot;Cable Route&quot; is rated class 3, while the same face away from the cables is rated class 5.
The Cable Route can be crowded. Since 2010, all hikers who intend to ascend the Cable Route must first obtain permits when the cables are up between May and October. Permits are limited to 300 per day, and , more than 70,000 applications were received in the pre-season and daily permit lotteries. Permits are checked by a ranger on the trail. Hikers without permits are not allowed to hike beyond the base of the sub-dome or to the bottom of the cables. Hikers caught bypassing the rangers to visit either the sub-dome or main dome without a permit face fines of up to $5,000, and/or 6 months in jail.

Backpackers with an appropriate wilderness permit can receive a Half Dome permit when they pick up their wilderness permit with no additional reservation required. Rock climbers who reach the top of Half Dome without entering the subdome area can descend on the Half Dome Trail without a permit.

The top of Half Dome is a large, flat area where climbers can relax and enjoy their accomplishment. The summit offers views of the surrounding areas, including Little Yosemite Valley and the Valley Floor. A notable location to one side of Half Dome is the &quot;Diving Board&quot;, where Ansel Adams took his photograph &quot;Monolith, the Face of Half Dome&quot; on April 10, 1927. Often confused with &quot;the Visor,&quot; a small overhanging ledge at the summit, the Diving Board is on the shoulder of Half Dome.

The Cable Route was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

=== Incidents and risks ===
From 1919 when the cables were erected to 2024, there have been 10 confirmed deaths on the cable section. The latest fatality occurred on July 13, 2024. In August 2024, there were calls to double the number of wooden rungs on the climb, to increase safety. Most accidents occur when the rock is wet, and climbers are advised to check the weather before attempting the summit.

Lightning strikes can be a risk while on or near the summit. On July 27, 1985, five hikers were struck by lightning, resulting in two fatalities.

==In culture==
Half Dome was originally called &quot;Tis-sa-ack&quot;, meaning Cleft Rock in the language of the local Ahwahnechee people. Tis-sa-ack is also the name of the fourth route on the formation, ascended by Royal Robbins and Don Peterson over eight days in October 1969. Tis-sa-ack is the name of a mother from a native legend. The face seen in Half Dome is supposed to be hers. Tis-sa-ack is the name of a Mono Lake Paiute girl in the Yosemite Native American legend. John Muir interchangeably used &quot;Tissiack,&quot; &quot;South Dome,&quot; and &quot;Half Dome&quot; in his writings.

Others say Ahwahneechee Native Americans named Half Dome &quot;Face of a Young Woman Stained with Tears&quot; (&quot;Tis-se&#x27;-yak&quot;) because of the colonies of brown-black lichens that form dark vertical drip-like stripes along drainage tracks in the rock faces.

Jack London&#x27;s 1900 short story &quot;Dutch Courage&quot; tells of a fictional climb of Half Dome.

&quot;Monolith, the Face of Half Dome&quot; is a black and white photograph taken by Ansel Adams in 1927 that depicts the western face of Half Dome as seen from the &quot;Diving Board&quot;. It was used by the Sierra Club as a visual aid for the environmental movement, and was a part of the portfolio &quot;Parmelian Prints of the High Sierras&quot;. The ashes of Ansel Adams were later scattered on Half Dome after he died.

Half Dome was used as the logo for a software company, Sierra On-Line.

In 1971, outdoor recreation and climbing equipment company The North Face created their company logo, based upon a stylized depiction of the Half Dome formation. It is still their logo 50 years later.

In 1988, Half Dome was featured on a 25 cent United States postage stamp. An image of Half Dome, along with John Muir and the California condor, appears on the California State Quarter, released in January 2005.

From 2010 until the introduction of REAL ID, California driver&#x27;s licenses featured an illustration of Half Dome.

<text>The fundamental theorem of algebra, also called d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s theorem or the d&#x27;Alembert–Gauss theorem, states that every non-constant single-variable polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. This includes polynomials with real coefficients, since every real number is a complex number with its imaginary part equal to zero.

Equivalently (by definition), the theorem states that the field of complex numbers is algebraically closed.

The theorem is also stated as follows: every non-zero, single-variable, degree &quot;n&quot; polynomial with complex coefficients has, counted with multiplicity, exactly &quot;n&quot; complex roots. The equivalence of the two statements can be proven through the use of successive polynomial division.

Despite its name, it is not fundamental for modern algebra; it was named when algebra was synonymous with the theory of equations.

==History==
, in his book &quot;Arithmetica Philosophica&quot; (published in 1608, at Nürnberg, by Johann Lantzenberger), wrote that a polynomial equation of degree &quot;n&quot; (with real coefficients) &quot;may&quot; have &quot;n&quot; solutions. Albert Girard, in his book &quot;L&#x27;invention nouvelle en l&#x27;Algèbre&quot; (published in 1629), asserted that a polynomial equation of degree &quot;n&quot; has &quot;n&quot; solutions, but he did not state that they had to be real numbers. Furthermore, he added that his assertion holds &quot;unless the equation is incomplete&quot;, by which he meant that no coefficient is equal to 0. However, when he explains in detail what he means, it is clear that he actually believes that his assertion is always true; for instance, he shows that the equation formula_1 although incomplete, has four solutions (counting multiplicities): 1 (twice), formula_2 and formula_3

As will be mentioned again below, it follows from the fundamental theorem of algebra that every non-constant polynomial with real coefficients can be written as a product of polynomials with real coefficients whose degrees are either 1 or 2. However, in 1702 Leibniz erroneously said that no polynomial of the type (with real and distinct from 0) can be written in such a way. Later, Nikolaus Bernoulli made the same assertion concerning the polynomial , but he got a letter from Euler in 1742 in which it was shown that this polynomial is equal to
:formula_4
with formula_5
Also, Euler pointed out that
:formula_6

A first attempt at proving the theorem was made by d&#x27;Alembert in 1746, but his proof was incomplete. Among other problems, it assumed implicitly a theorem (now known as Puiseux&#x27;s theorem), which would not be proved until more than a century later and using the fundamental theorem of algebra. Other attempts were made by Euler (1749), de Foncenex (1759), Lagrange (1772), and Laplace (1795). These last four attempts assumed implicitly Girard&#x27;s assertion; to be more precise, the existence of solutions was assumed and all that remained to be proved was that their form was &quot;a&quot; + &quot;bi&quot; for some real numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. In modern terms, Euler, de Foncenex, Lagrange, and Laplace were assuming the existence of a splitting field of the polynomial &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;).

At the end of the 18th century, two new proofs were published which did not assume the existence of roots, but neither of which was complete. One of them, due to James Wood and mainly algebraic, was published in 1798 and it was totally ignored. Wood&#x27;s proof had an algebraic gap. The other one was published by Gauss in 1799 and it was mainly geometric, but it had a topological gap, only filled by Alexander Ostrowski in 1920, as discussed in Smale (1981).

The first rigorous proof was published by Argand, an amateur mathematician, in 1806 (and revisited in 1813); it was also here that, for the first time, the fundamental theorem of algebra was stated for polynomials with complex coefficients, rather than just real coefficients. Gauss produced two other proofs in 1816 and another incomplete version of his original proof in 1849.

The first textbook containing a proof of the theorem was Cauchy&#x27;s &quot;Cours d&#x27;analyse de l&#x27;École Royale Polytechnique&quot; (1821). It contained Argand&#x27;s proof, although Argand is not credited for it.

None of the proofs mentioned so far is constructive. It was Weierstrass who raised for the first time, in the middle of the 19th century, the problem of finding a constructive proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra. He presented his solution, which amounts in modern terms to a combination of the Durand–Kerner method with the homotopy continuation principle, in 1891. Another proof of this kind was obtained by Hellmuth Kneser in 1940 and simplified by his son Martin Kneser in 1981.

Without using countable choice, it is not possible to constructively prove the fundamental theorem of algebra for complex numbers based on the Dedekind real numbers (which are not constructively equivalent to the Cauchy real numbers without countable choice). However, Fred Richman proved a reformulated version of the theorem that does work.

==Equivalent statements==
There are several equivalent formulations of the theorem:
* &quot;Every univariate polynomial of positive degree with real coefficients has at least one complex root.&quot;
* &quot;Every univariate polynomial of positive degree with complex coefficients has at least one complex root.&quot;
*:This implies immediately the previous assertion, as real numbers are also complex numbers. The converse results from the fact that one gets a polynomial with real coefficients by taking the product of a polynomial and its complex conjugate (obtained by replacing each coefficient with its complex conjugate). A root of this product is either a root of the given polynomial, or of its conjugate; in the latter case, the conjugate of this root is a root of the given polynomial. 
* &quot;Every univariate polynomial of positive degree with complex coefficients can be factorized as formula_7 where formula_8 are complex numbers.&quot;
*:The complex numbers formula_9 are the roots of the polynomial. If a root appears in several factors, it is a multiple root, and the number of its occurrences is, by definition, the multiplicity of the root.
*: The proof that this statement results from the previous ones is done by recursion on : when a root formula_10 has been found, the polynomial division by formula_11 provides a polynomial of degree formula_12 whose roots are the other roots of the given polynomial.
The next two statements are equivalent to the previous ones, although they do not involve any nonreal complex number. These statements can be proved from previous factorizations by remarking that, if is a non-real root of a polynomial with real coefficients, its complex conjugate formula_13 is also a root, and formula_14 is a polynomial of degree two with real coefficients (this is the complex conjugate root theorem). Conversely, if one has a factor of degree two, the quadratic formula gives a root.
* &quot;Every univariate polynomial with real coefficients of degree larger than two has a factor of degree two with real coefficients.&quot;
* &quot;Every univariate polynomial with real coefficients of positive degree can be factored as formula_15 where is a real number and each formula_16 is a monic polynomial of degree at most two with real coefficients. Moreover, one can suppose that the factors of degree two do not have any real root.&quot;

==Proofs==
All proofs below involve some mathematical analysis, or at least the topological concept of continuity of real or complex functions. Some also use differentiable or even analytic functions. This requirement has led to the remark that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is neither fundamental, nor a theorem of algebra.

Some proofs of the theorem only prove that any non-constant polynomial with &quot;real&quot; coefficients has some complex root. This lemma is enough to establish the general case because, given a non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients, the polynomial
:formula_17
has only real coefficients, and, if is a root of , then either or its conjugate is a root of . Here, formula_18 is the polynomial obtained by replacing each coefficient of with its complex conjugate; the roots of formula_18 are exactly the complex conjugates of the roots of 

Many non-algebraic proofs of the theorem use the fact (sometimes called the &quot;growth lemma&quot;) that a polynomial function &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) of degree &quot;n&quot; whose dominant coefficient is 1 behaves like &quot;zn&quot; when |&quot;z&quot;| is large enough. More precisely, there is some positive real number &quot;R&quot; such that

:formula_20

when |&quot;z&quot;| &gt; &quot;R&quot;.

===Real-analytic proofs===
Even without using complex numbers, it is possible to show that a real-valued polynomial &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;): &quot;p&quot;(0) ≠ 0 of degree &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2 can always be divided by some quadratic polynomial with real coefficients. In other words, for some real-valued &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, the coefficients of the linear remainder on dividing &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) by &quot;x&quot;2 − &quot;ax&quot; − &quot;b&quot; simultaneously become zero.

: formula_21

where &quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a polynomial of degree &quot;n&quot; − 2. The coefficients &quot;R&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) and &quot;S&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) are independent of &quot;x&quot; and completely defined by the coefficients of &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). In terms of representation, &quot;R&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) and &quot;S&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) are bivariate polynomials in &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. In the flavor of Gauss&#x27;s first (incomplete) proof of this theorem from 1799, the key is to show that for any sufficiently large negative value of &quot;b&quot;, all the roots of both &quot;R&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) and &quot;S&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) in the variable &quot;a&quot; are real-valued and alternating each other (interlacing property). Utilizing a Sturm-like chain that contain &quot;R&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) and &quot;S&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) as consecutive terms, interlacing in the variable &quot;a&quot; can be shown for all consecutive pairs in the chain whenever &quot;b&quot; has sufficiently large negative value. As &quot;S&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; = 0) = &quot;p&quot;(0) has no roots, interlacing of &quot;R&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) and &quot;S&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) in the variable &quot;a&quot; fails at &quot;b&quot; = 0. Topological arguments can be applied on the interlacing property to show that the locus of the roots of &quot;R&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) and &quot;S&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) must intersect for some real-valued &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; &lt; 0.

===Complex-analytic proofs===
Find a closed disk &quot;D&quot; of radius &quot;r&quot; centered at the origin such that |&quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)| &gt; |&quot;p&quot;(0)| whenever |&quot;z&quot;| ≥ &quot;r&quot;. The minimum of |&quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)| on &quot;D&quot;, which must exist since &quot;D&quot; is compact, is therefore achieved at some point &quot;z&quot;0 in the interior of &quot;D&quot;, but not at any point of its boundary. The maximum modulus principle applied to 1/&quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) implies that &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;0) = 0. In other words, &quot;z&quot;0 is a zero of &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;).

A variation of this proof does not require the maximum modulus principle (in fact, a similar argument also gives a proof of the maximum modulus principle for holomorphic functions). Continuing from before the principle was invoked, if &quot;a&quot; := &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;0) ≠ 0, then, expanding &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) in powers of &quot;z&quot; − &quot;z&quot;0, we can write

:formula_22

Here, the &quot;cj&quot; are simply the coefficients of the polynomial &quot;z&quot; → &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot; + &quot;z&quot;0) after expansion, and &quot;k&quot; is the index of the first non-zero coefficient following the constant term. For &quot;z&quot; sufficiently close to &quot;z&quot;0 this function has behavior asymptotically similar to the simpler polynomial formula_23. More precisely, the function

:formula_24

for some positive constant &quot;M&quot; in some neighborhood of &quot;z&quot;0. Therefore, if we define formula_25 and let formula_26 tracing a circle of radius &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0 around &quot;z&quot;, then for any sufficiently small &quot;r&quot; (so that the bound &quot;M&quot; holds), we see that

:formula_27

When &quot;r&quot; is sufficiently close to 0 this upper bound for |&quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)| is strictly smaller than |&quot;a&quot;|, contradicting the definition of &quot;z&quot;0. Geometrically, we have found an explicit direction θ0 such that if one approaches &quot;z&quot;0 from that direction one can obtain values &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) smaller in absolute value than |&quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;0)|.

Another analytic proof can be obtained along this line of thought observing that, since |&quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)| &gt; |&quot;p&quot;(0)| outside &quot;D&quot;, the minimum of |&quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)| on the whole complex plane is achieved at &quot;z&quot;0. If |&quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;0)| &gt; 0, then 1/&quot;p&quot; is a bounded holomorphic function in the entire complex plane since, for each complex number &quot;z&quot;, |1/&quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)| ≤ |1/&quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;0)|. Applying Liouville&#x27;s theorem, which states that a bounded entire function must be constant, this would imply that 1/&quot;p&quot; is constant and therefore that &quot;p&quot; is constant. This gives a contradiction, and hence &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;0) = 0.

Yet another analytic proof uses the argument principle. Let &quot;R&quot; be a positive real number large enough so that every root of &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) has absolute value smaller than &quot;R&quot;; such a number must exist because every non-constant polynomial function of degree &quot;n&quot; has at most &quot;n&quot; zeros. For each &quot;r&quot; &gt; &quot;R&quot;, consider the number

:formula_28

where &quot;c&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) is the circle centered at 0 with radius &quot;r&quot; oriented counterclockwise; then the argument principle says that this number is the number &quot;N&quot; of zeros of &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) in the open ball centered at 0 with radius &quot;r&quot;, which, since &quot;r&quot; &gt; &quot;R&quot;, is the total number of zeros of &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;). On the other hand, the integral of &quot;n&quot;/&quot;z&quot; along &quot;c&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) divided by 2π&quot;i&quot; is equal to &quot;n&quot;. But the difference between the two numbers is

:formula_29

The numerator of the rational expression being integrated has degree at most &quot;n&quot; − 1 and the degree of the denominator is &quot;n&quot; + 1. Therefore, the number above tends to 0 as &quot;r&quot; → +∞. But the number is also equal to &quot;N&quot; − &quot;n&quot; and so &quot;N&quot; = &quot;n&quot;.

Another complex-analytic proof can be given by combining linear algebra with the Cauchy theorem. To establish that every complex polynomial of degree &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0 has a zero, it suffices to show that every complex square matrix of size &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0 has a (complex) eigenvalue. The proof of the latter statement is by contradiction.

Let &quot;A&quot; be a complex square matrix of size &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0 and let &quot;In&quot; be the unit matrix of the same size. Assume &quot;A&quot; has no eigenvalues. Consider the resolvent function

:formula_30

which is a meromorphic function on the complex plane with values in the vector space of matrices. The eigenvalues of &quot;A&quot; are precisely the poles of &quot;R&quot;(&quot;z&quot;). Since, by assumption, &quot;A&quot; has no eigenvalues, the function &quot;R&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is an entire function and Cauchy theorem implies that

:formula_31

On the other hand, &quot;R&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) expanded as a geometric series gives:

:formula_32

This formula is valid outside the closed disc of radius formula_33 (the operator norm of &quot;A&quot;). Let formula_34 Then

:formula_35

(in which only the summand &quot;k&quot; = 0 has a nonzero integral). This is a contradiction, and so &quot;A&quot; has an eigenvalue.

Finally, Rouché&#x27;s theorem gives perhaps the shortest proof of the theorem.
===Topological proofs===
Suppose the minimum of |&quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)| on the whole complex plane is achieved at &quot;z&quot;0; it was seen at the proof which uses Liouville&#x27;s theorem that such a number must exist. We can write &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) as a polynomial in &quot;z&quot; − &quot;z&quot;0: there is some natural number &quot;k&quot; and there are some complex numbers &quot;ck&quot;, &quot;c&quot;&quot;k&quot; + 1, ..., &quot;cn&quot; such that &quot;ck&quot; ≠ 0 and:

:formula_36

If &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;0) is nonzero, it follows that if &quot;a&quot; is a &quot;k&quot;th root of −&quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;0)/&quot;ck&quot; and if &quot;t&quot; is positive and sufficiently small, then |&quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;0 + &quot;ta&quot;)| &lt; |&quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;0)|, which is impossible, since |&quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;0)| is the minimum of |&quot;p&quot;| on &quot;D&quot;.

For another topological proof by contradiction, suppose that the polynomial &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) has no roots, and consequently is never equal to 0. Think of the polynomial as a map from the complex plane into the complex plane. It maps any circle |&quot;z&quot;| = &quot;R&quot; into a closed loop, a curve &quot;P&quot;(&quot;R&quot;). We will consider what happens to the winding number of &quot;P&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) at the extremes when &quot;R&quot; is very large and when &quot;R&quot; = 0. When &quot;R&quot; is a sufficiently large number, then the leading term &quot;zn&quot; of &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) dominates all other terms combined; in other words,

:formula_37

When &quot;z&quot; traverses the circle formula_38 once counter-clockwise formula_39 then formula_40 winds &quot;n&quot; times counter-clockwise formula_41 around the origin (0,0), and &quot;P&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) likewise. At the other extreme, with |&quot;z&quot;| = 0, the curve &quot;P&quot;(0) is merely the single point &quot;p&quot;(0), which must be nonzero because &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is never zero. Thus &quot;p&quot;(0) must be distinct from the origin (0,0), which denotes 0 in the complex plane. The winding number of &quot;P&quot;(0) around the origin (0,0) is thus 0. Now changing &quot;R&quot; continuously will deform the loop continuously. At some &quot;R&quot; the winding number must change. But that can only happen if the curve &quot;P&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) includes the origin (0,0) for some &quot;R&quot;. But then for some &quot;z&quot; on that circle |&quot;z&quot;| = &quot;R&quot; we have &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) = 0, contradicting our original assumption. Therefore, &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) has at least one zero.

===Algebraic proofs===
These proofs of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra must make use of the following two facts about real numbers that are not algebraic but require only a small amount of analysis (more precisely, the intermediate value theorem in both cases):
* every polynomial with an odd degree and real coefficients has some real root;
* every non-negative real number has a square root.

The second fact, together with the quadratic formula, implies the theorem for real quadratic polynomials. In other words, algebraic proofs of the fundamental theorem actually show that if &quot;R&quot; is any real-closed field, then its extension &quot;C&quot; = &quot;R&quot;() is algebraically closed.

====By induction====
As mentioned above, it suffices to check the statement &quot;every non-constant polynomial &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) with real coefficients has a complex root&quot;. This statement can be proved by induction on the greatest non-negative integer &quot;k&quot; such that 2&quot;k&quot; divides the degree &quot;n&quot; of &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;). Let &quot;a&quot; be the coefficient of &quot;zn&quot; in &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) and let &quot;F&quot; be a splitting field of &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) over &quot;C&quot;; in other words, the field &quot;F&quot; contains &quot;C&quot; and there are elements &quot;z&quot;1, &quot;z&quot;2, ..., &quot;zn&quot; in &quot;F&quot; such that

:formula_42

If &quot;k&quot; = 0, then &quot;n&quot; is odd, and therefore &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) has a real root. Now, suppose that &quot;n&quot; = 2&quot;km&quot; (with &quot;m&quot; odd and &quot;k&quot; &gt; 0) and that the theorem is already proved when the degree of the polynomial has the form 2&quot;k&quot; − 1&quot;m&quot;′ with &quot;m&quot;′ odd. For a real number &quot;t&quot;, define:

:formula_43

Then the coefficients of &quot;qt&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) are symmetric polynomials in the &quot;zi&quot; with real coefficients. Therefore, they can be expressed as polynomials with real coefficients in the elementary symmetric polynomials, that is, in −&quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, ..., (−1)&quot;nan&quot;. So &quot;qt&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) has in fact &quot;real&quot; coefficients. Furthermore, the degree of &quot;qt&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is &quot;n&quot;(&quot;n&quot; − 1)/2 = 2&quot;k&quot;−1&quot;m&quot;(&quot;n&quot; − 1), and &quot;m&quot;(&quot;n&quot; − 1) is an odd number. So, using the induction hypothesis, &quot;qt&quot; has at least one complex root; in other words, &quot;zi&quot; + &quot;zj&quot; + &quot;tzizj&quot; is complex for two distinct elements &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; from {1, ..., &quot;n&quot;}. Since there are more real numbers than pairs (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;), one can find distinct real numbers &quot;t&quot; and &quot;s&quot; such that &quot;zi&quot; + &quot;zj&quot; + &quot;tzizj&quot; and &quot;zi&quot; + &quot;zj&quot; + &quot;szizj&quot; are complex (for the same &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;). So, both &quot;zi&quot; + &quot;zj&quot; and &quot;zizj&quot; are complex numbers. It is easy to check that every complex number has a complex square root, thus every complex polynomial of degree 2 has a complex root by the quadratic formula. It follows that &quot;zi&quot; and &quot;zj&quot; are complex numbers, since they are roots of the quadratic polynomial &quot;z&quot;2 −  (&quot;zi&quot; + &quot;zj&quot;)&quot;z&quot; + &quot;zizj&quot;.

Joseph Shipman showed in 2007 that the assumption that odd degree polynomials have roots is stronger than necessary; any field in which polynomials of prime degree have roots is algebraically closed (so &quot;odd&quot; can be replaced by &quot;odd prime&quot; and this holds for fields of all characteristics). For axiomatization of algebraically closed fields, this is the best possible, as there are counterexamples if a single prime is excluded. However, these counterexamples rely on −1 having a square root. If we take a field where −1 has no square root, and every polynomial of degree &quot;n&quot; ∈ &quot;I&quot; has a root, where &quot;I&quot; is any fixed infinite set of odd numbers, then every polynomial &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) of odd degree has a root (since has a root, where &quot;k&quot; is chosen so that ).

====From Galois theory====
Another algebraic proof of the fundamental theorem can be given using Galois theory. It suffices to show that C has no proper finite field extension. Let &quot;K&quot;/C be a finite extension. Since the normal closure of &quot;K&quot; over R still has a finite degree over C (or R), we may assume without loss of generality that &quot;K&quot; is a normal extension of R (hence it is a Galois extension, as every algebraic extension of a field of characteristic 0 is separable). Let &quot;G&quot; be the Galois group of this extension, and let &quot;H&quot; be a Sylow 2-subgroup of &quot;G&quot;, so that the order of &quot;H&quot; is a power of 2, and the index of &quot;H&quot; in &quot;G&quot; is odd. By the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, there exists a subextension &quot;L&quot; of &quot;K&quot;/R such that Gal(&quot;K&quot;/&quot;L&quot;) = &quot;H&quot;. As [&quot;L&quot;:R] = [&quot;G&quot;:&quot;H&quot;] is odd, and there are no nonlinear irreducible real polynomials of odd degree, we must have &quot;L&quot; = R, thus [&quot;K&quot;:R] and [&quot;K&quot;:C] are powers of 2. Assuming by way of contradiction that [&quot;K&quot;:C] &gt; 1, we conclude that the 2-group Gal(&quot;K&quot;/C) contains a subgroup of index 2, so there exists a subextension &quot;M&quot; of C of degree 2. However, C has no extension of degree 2, because every quadratic complex polynomial has a complex root, as mentioned above. This shows that [&quot;K&quot;:C] = 1, and therefore &quot;K&quot; = C, which completes the proof.

===Geometric proofs===
There exists still another way to approach the fundamental theorem of algebra, due to J. M. Almira and A. Romero: by Riemannian geometric arguments. The main idea here is to prove that the existence of a non-constant polynomial &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) without zeros implies the existence of a flat Riemannian metric over the sphere S2. This leads to a contradiction since the sphere is not flat.

A Riemannian surface (&quot;M&quot;, &quot;g&quot;) is said to be flat if its Gaussian curvature, which we denote by &quot;Kg&quot;, is identically null. Now, the Gauss–Bonnet theorem, when applied to the sphere S2, claims that

:formula_44

which proves that the sphere is not flat.

Let us now assume that &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0 and

:formula_45

for each complex number &quot;z&quot;. Let us define

:formula_46

Obviously, &quot;p*&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) ≠ 0 for all &quot;z&quot; in C. Consider the polynomial &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) = &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)&quot;p*&quot;(&quot;z&quot;). Then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) ≠ 0 for each &quot;z&quot; in C. Furthermore,

:formula_47

We can use this functional equation to prove that &quot;g&quot;, given by

:formula_48

for &quot;w&quot; in C, and

:formula_49

for &quot;w&quot; ∈ S2\{0}, is a well defined Riemannian metric over the sphere S2 (which we identify with the extended complex plane C ∪ {∞}).

Now, a simple computation shows that

:formula_50

since the real part of an analytic function is harmonic. This proves that &quot;Kg&quot; = 0.

==Corollaries==
Since the fundamental theorem of algebra can be seen as the statement that the field of complex numbers is algebraically closed, it follows that any theorem concerning algebraically closed fields applies to the field of complex numbers. Here are a few more consequences of the theorem, which are either about the field of real numbers or the relationship between the field of real numbers and the field of complex numbers:

* The field of complex numbers is the algebraic closure of the field of real numbers.
* Every polynomial in one variable &quot;z&quot; with complex coefficients is the product of a complex constant and polynomials of the form &quot;z&quot; + &quot;a&quot; with &quot;a&quot; complex.
* Every polynomial in one variable &quot;x&quot; with real coefficients can be uniquely written as the product of a constant, polynomials of the form &quot;x&quot; + &quot;a&quot; with &quot;a&quot; real, and polynomials of the form &quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;ax&quot; + &quot;b&quot; with &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; real and &quot;a&quot;2 − 4&quot;b&quot; &lt; 0 (which is the same thing as saying that the polynomial &quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;ax&quot; + &quot;b&quot; has no real roots). (By the Abel–Ruffini theorem, the real numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are not necessarily expressible in terms of the coefficients of the polynomial, the basic arithmetic operations and the extraction of &quot;n&quot;-th roots.) This implies that the number of non-real complex roots is always even and remains even when counted with their multiplicity.
* Every rational function in one variable &quot;x&quot;, with real coefficients, can be written as the sum of a polynomial function with rational functions of the form &quot;a&quot;/(&quot;x&quot; − &quot;b&quot;)&quot;n&quot; (where &quot;n&quot; is a natural number, and &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are real numbers), and rational functions of the form (&quot;ax&quot; + &quot;b&quot;)/(&quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;cx&quot; + &quot;d&quot;)&quot;n&quot; (where &quot;n&quot; is a natural number, and &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;d&quot; are real numbers such that &quot;c&quot;2 − 4&quot;d&quot; &lt; 0). A corollary of this is that every rational function in one variable and real coefficients has an elementary primitive.
* Every algebraic extension of the real field is isomorphic either to the real field or to the complex field.

==Bounds on the zeros of a polynomial==

While the fundamental theorem of algebra states a general existence result, it is of some interest, both from the theoretical and from the practical point of view, to have information on the location of the zeros of a given polynomial. The simplest result in this direction is a bound on the modulus: all zeros ζ of a monic polynomial formula_51 satisfy an inequality |ζ| ≤ &quot;R&quot;∞, where

:formula_52

As stated, this is not yet an existence result but rather an example of what is called an a priori bound: it says that &quot;if there are solutions&quot; then they lie inside the closed disk of center the origin and radius &quot;R&quot;∞. However, once coupled with the fundamental theorem of algebra it says that the disk contains in fact at least one solution. More generally, a bound can be given directly in terms of any p-norm of the &quot;n&quot;-vector of coefficients formula_53 that is |ζ| ≤ &quot;Rp&quot;, where &quot;Rp&quot; is precisely the &quot;q&quot;-norm of the 2-vector formula_54 &quot;q&quot; being the conjugate exponent of &quot;p&quot;, formula_55 for any 1 ≤ &quot;p&quot; ≤ ∞. Thus, the modulus of any solution is also bounded by

:formula_56
:formula_57

for 1 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; ∞, and in particular

:formula_58

(where we define &quot;an&quot; to mean 1, which is reasonable since 1 is indeed the &quot;n&quot;-th coefficient of our polynomial). The case of a generic polynomial of degree &quot;n&quot;,

:formula_59

is of course reduced to the case of a monic, dividing all coefficients by &quot;an&quot; ≠ 0. Also, in case that 0 is not a root, i.e. &quot;a&quot;0 ≠ 0, bounds from below on the roots ζ follow immediately as bounds from above on formula_60, that is, the roots of

:formula_61

Finally, the distance formula_62 from the roots ζ to any point formula_63 can be estimated from below and above, seeing formula_64 as zeros of the polynomial formula_65, whose coefficients are the Taylor expansion of &quot;P&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) at formula_66

Let ζ be a root of the polynomial

:formula_67

in order to prove the inequality |ζ| ≤ &quot;Rp&quot; we can assume, of course, |ζ| &gt; 1. Writing the equation as

:formula_68

and using the Hölder&#x27;s inequality we find

:formula_69

Now, if &quot;p&quot; = 1, this is

:formula_70

thus

:formula_71

In the case 1 &lt; &quot;p&quot; ≤ ∞, taking into account the summation formula for a geometric progression, we have

:formula_72

thus

:formula_73

and simplifying,

:formula_74

Therefore

:formula_75

holds, for all 1 ≤ &quot;p&quot; ≤ ∞.

<text>Nikos Kazantzakis (; ; 2 March (OS 18 February) 188326 October 1957) was a Greek writer, journalist, politician, poet and philosopher. Widely considered a giant of modern Greek literature, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in nine different years, and remains the most translated Greek author worldwide.

Kazantzakis&#x27;s novels included &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; (published in 1946 as &quot;Life and Times of Alexis Zorbas&quot;), &quot;Christ Recrucified&quot; (1948), &quot;Captain Michalis&quot; (1950, translated as &quot;Freedom or Death&quot;), and &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1955). He also wrote plays, travel books, memoirs, and philosophical essays, such as &quot;The Saviors of God: Spiritual Exercises&quot;. His fame spread in the English-speaking world due to cinematic adaptations of &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988).

He also translated a number of notable works into Modern Greek, such as the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, and Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

==Biography==

Kazantzakis was born in the town of Kandiye (now Heraklion) in Crete, with origins from the village of Myrtia. Crete had not yet joined the modern Greek state (which had been established in 1832), and was still under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. Based on family records, Kazantzakis was born on 18 February 1883 (OS), in contrast to the census of Heraklion which listed his birthyear as 1881; this discrepancy was settled by Kazantzakis himself in one of his epistles.

From 1902 to 1906 Kazantzakis studied law at the University of Athens; his 1906 Juris Doctor thesis was titled (&quot;Friedrich Nietzsche on the Philosophy of Law and the State&quot;). Then he went to the Sorbonne in 1907 to study philosophy. There he fell under the influence of Henri Bergson. His 1909 doctoral dissertation at the Sorbonne was a reworked version of his 1906 dissertation under the title &quot;Friedrich Nietzsche dans la philosophie du droit et de la cité&quot; (&quot;Friedrich Nietzsche on the Philosophy of Right and the State&quot;). Upon his return to Greece, he began translating works of philosophy. In 1914, he met the writer Angelos Sikelianos. Together they travelled for two years through places where Greek Orthodox Christian culture flourished, largely due to the enthusiastic nationalism of Sikelianos.

Kazantzakis married Galateia Alexiou in 1911; they divorced in 1926. Kazantzakis met Eleni Samiou (Helen) in 1924. They began a romantic relationship in 1928, though they were not married until 1945. Samiou helped Kazantzakis with his work, typing drafts, accompanying him on his travels, and managing his business affairs. They were married until his death in 1957. Samiou died in 2004.

Between 1922 and his death in 1957, he sojourned in Paris and Berlin (from 1922 to 1924), Italy, Russia (in 1925), Spain (in 1932), and then later in Cyprus, Aegina, Egypt, Mount Sinai, Czechoslovakia, Nice (he later bought a villa in nearby Antibes, in the Old Town section near the famed seawall), China, and Japan.

While in Berlin, where the political situation was explosive, Kazantzakis discovered communism and became an admirer of Vladimir Lenin. He never became a committed communist but visited the Soviet Union and stayed with the Left Opposition politician and writer Victor Serge. He witnessed the rise of Joseph Stalin, and became disillusioned with Soviet-style communism. Around this time, his earlier nationalist beliefs were gradually replaced by a more universalist ideology. As a journalist, in 1926 he interviewed prime minister of Spain Miguel Primo de Rivera and the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini.

During WWII, he was in Athens, where he and the philologist Ioannis Kakridis translated the &quot;Iliad&quot;. In 1945, he became the leader of a small party on the non-communist left, and entered the Greek government as Minister without Portfolio. He resigned this post the following year. In 1946, Kazantzakis became the head of the UNESCO Bureau of Translations, the organization which promoted translations of literary works. However, he resigned in 1947 to concentrate on writing, and indeed produced most of his literary output during the last ten years of his life.

In 1946, &quot;The Society of Greek Writers&quot; recommended that Kazantzakis and Angelos Sikelianos be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. In 1957, he lost the Prize to Albert Camus by a single vote. Camus later said that Kazantzakis deserved the honour &quot;a hundred times more&quot; than himself. In total, Kazantzakis was nominated in nine different years.

===Death===

Late in 1957, even though suffering from leukemia, Kazantzakis set out on one last trip to China and Japan. According to one theory, while in China Kazantzakis had to be vaccinated, possibly due to symptoms of smallpox and cholera. The vaccine, however, caused him gangrene and at the expense of the Chinese government he was transported first to Copenhagen and then to Freiburg. His gangrene was cured but he had contracted a severe form of Asian flu in China, which eventually led to his death.

Kazantzakis died on 26 October 1957 in Freiburg, Germany, at age 74. He is buried at the highest point of the Walls of Heraklion, the &quot;Martinengo Bastion&quot;, looking out over the mountains and sea of Crete. His epitaph reads &quot;I hope for nothing. I fear nothing. I am free.&quot; ( ) Kazantzakis developed this famously pithy phrasing of the philosophical ideal of cynicism, which dates back to at least the second century CE.

The 50th anniversary of the death of Nikos Kazantzakis was selected as the main motif for a high-value euro collectors&#x27; coin; the €10 Greek Nikos Kazantzakis commemorative coin, minted in 2007. His image is on the obverse of the coin, while the reverse carries the National Emblem of Greece, with his signature.

==Literary work==
Kazantzakis&#x27;s first published work was the 1906 narrative, &quot;Serpent and Lily&quot; (Όφις και Κρίνο), which he signed with the pen name Karma Nirvami. In 1907 Kazantzakis went to Paris for his graduate studies and was deeply influenced by the philosophy of Henri Bergson, primarily the idea that a true understanding of the world comes from the combination of intuition, personal experience, and rational thought. The theme of rationalism mixed with irrationality later became central to many of Kazantzakis&#x27;s later stories, characters, and personal philosophies. Later, in 1909, he wrote a one-act play titled &quot;Comedy&quot;, which was filled with existential themes, predating the post-World War II existentialist movement in Europe spearheaded by writers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Camus. After completing his studies in Paris, he wrote the tragedy, &quot;The Master Builder&quot; (), based on a popular Greek folkloric myth.

Through the next several decades, from the 1910s through the 1930s, Kazantzakis traveled around Greece, much of Europe, northern Africa, and to several countries in Asia. Countries he visited include: Germany, Italy, France, The Netherlands, Romania, Egypt, Russia, Japan, and China, among others. These journeys put Kazantzakis in contact with different philosophies, ideologies, lifestyles, and people, all of which influenced him and his writings. Kazantzakis would often write about his influences in letters to friends, citing Sigmund Freud, the philosophy of Nietzsche, Buddhist theology, and communist ideology as major influences. While he continued to travel later in life, the bulk of his travel writing came from this time period.

Kazantzakis began writing &quot;The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel&quot; in 1924, and completed it in 1938 after fourteen years of writing and revision. The poem follows the hero of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Odysseus, as he undertakes a final journey after the end of the original poem. Following the structure of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, it is divided into 24 rhapsodies and consists of 33,333 lines. While Kazantzakis felt this poem held his cumulative wisdom and experience, and that it was his greatest literary experience, critics were split, &quot;some praised it as an unprecedented epic, [while] many simply viewed it as a hybristic act,&quot; with many scholars still being split to this day. A common criticism of &quot;The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel&quot; was aimed at Kazantzakis&#x27;s over-reliance on flowery and metaphorical verse, a criticism that is also aimed at his works of fiction.

Many of Kazantzakis&#x27;s most famous novels were published between 1940 and 1961, including &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; (1946), &quot;Christ Recrucified&quot; (1948), &quot;Captain Michalis&quot; (1953), &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1955), and &quot;Report to Greco&quot; (1961).

Scholar Peter Bien argues that each story explores different aspects of post-World War II Greek culture such as religion, nationalism, political beliefs, the Greek Civil War, gender roles, immigration, and general cultural practices and beliefs. These works also explore what Kazantzakis believed to be the unique physical and spiritual location of Greece, a nation that belongs to neither the East nor the West, an idea he put forth in many of his letters to friends. As the scholar Peter Bien argued, &quot;Kazantzakis viewed Greece&#x27;s special mission as the reconciliation of Eastern instinct with Western reason,&quot; echoing the Bergsonian themes that balance logic against emotion found in many of Kazantzakis&#x27;s novels.

Two of these works of fiction, &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; and &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; had major motion picture adaptations in 1964 and 1988 respectively.
== Language and use of Demotic Greek ==
During the time when Kazantzakis was writing his novels, poems, and plays, the majority of &quot;serious&quot; Greek artistic work was written in Katharevousa, a &quot;pure&quot; form of the Greek language that was created to bridge Ancient Greek with Modern, Demotic Greek, in order to &quot;purify&quot; Demotic Greek. The use of Demotic, among writers, gradually started to gain the upper hand only at the turn of the 20th century, under the influence of the New Athenian School (or Palamian).

In his letters to friends and correspondents, Kazantzakis wrote that he chose to write in Demotic Greek to capture the spirit of the people and to make his writing resonate with the common Greek citizen. Moreover, he wanted to prove that the common spoken language of Greek was able to produce artistic, literary works. &quot;Why not show off all the possibilities of Demotic Greek?&quot; he argued. Furthermore, Kazantzakis felt that it was important to record the vernacular of the everyday person, including Greek peasants, and often tried to include expressions, metaphors, and idioms he would hear while traveling throughout Greece and incorporate them into his writing for posterity. At the time of writing, some scholars and critics condemned his work because it was not written in Katharevousa, while others praised it precisely because it was written in Demotic Greek.

Several critics have argued that Kazantzakis&#x27;s writing was too flowery, filled with obscure metaphors, and difficult to read despite being written in Demotic Greek. Kazantzakis scholar Peter Bien argues that the metaphors and language Kazantzakis used were taken directly from the peasants he encountered when traveling Greece. Bien asserts that, since Kazantzakis was trying to preserve the language of the people, he used their local metaphors and phrases to give his narrative an air of authenticity and preserve these phrases so that they were not lost.

== Socialism ==
Throughout his life, Kazantzakis reiterated his belief that &quot;only socialism as the goal and democracy as the means&quot; could provide an equitable solution to the &quot;frightfully urgent problems of the age in which we are living.&quot; He saw the need for socialist parties throughout the world to put aside their bickering and unite so that the program of &quot;socialist democracy&quot; could prevail not just in Greece but throughout the civilized world. He described socialism as a social system that &quot;does not permit the exploitation of one person by another&quot; and that &quot;must guarantee every freedom.&quot;

Kazantzakis was anathema to the right-wing in Greece both before and after World War II. The right waged war against his books and called him &quot;immoral&quot; and a &quot;Bolshevik troublemaker&quot; and accused him of being a &quot;Russian agent&quot;. He was also distrusted by both the Communist Party of Greece and the Soviet Union as a &quot;bourgeois&quot; thinker. However, upon his death in 1957, he was honored by the Chinese Communist Party as a &quot;great writer&quot; and &quot;devotee of peace.&quot; Following the war, he was temporarily leader of a minor Greek leftist party, while in 1945 he was, among others, a founding member of the Greek-Soviet friendship union.

== Religious beliefs and relationship with the Greek Orthodox Church ==
While Kazantzakis was deeply spiritual, he often discussed his struggle with religious faith, specifically his Greek Orthodoxy. Baptized Greek Orthodox as a child, he was fascinated by the lives of saints from a young age. As a young man he took a month long trip to Mount Athos, a monastic retreat and major spiritual center for Greek Orthodoxy. Most critics and scholars of Kazantzakis agree that the struggle to find truth in religion and spirituality was central to many of his works, and that some novels, like &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; and &quot;Christ Recrucified&quot; focus completely on questioning Christian morals and values. As he traveled Europe, he was influenced by various philosophers, cultures, and religions, like Buddhism, causing him to question his Christian beliefs. While never claiming to be an atheist, his public questioning and critique put him at odds with some in the Greek Orthodox Church and many of his critics. Scholars theorize that Kazantzakis&#x27;s difficult relationship with many members of the clergy and with more religiously conservative literary critics, came from his questioning. In his book &quot;Broken Hallelujah: Nikos Kazantzakis and Christian Theology&quot;, author Darren Middleton theorizes that, &quot;Where the majority of Christian writers focus on God&#x27;s immutability, Jesus&#x27; deity, and our salvation through God&#x27;s grace, Kazantzakis emphasized divine mutability, Jesus&#x27; humanity, and God&#x27;s own redemption through our effort,&quot; highlighting Kazantzakis&#x27;s uncommon interpretation of traditional Orthodox Christian beliefs.

Many Orthodox Church clergy condemned Kazantzakis&#x27;s work and a campaign was started to excommunicate him. His reply was: &quot;You gave me a curse, Holy fathers, I give you a blessing: may your conscience be as clear as mine and may you be as moral and religious as I&quot; (&quot;&quot;). While the excommunication was rejected by the top leadership of the Orthodox Church, it became emblematic of the persistent disapprobation from many Christian authorities for his political and religious views.

Modern scholarship tends to dismiss the idea that Kazantzakis was being sacrilegious or blasphemous with the content of his novels and beliefs. These scholars argue that, if anything, Kazantzakis was acting in accordance to a long tradition of Christians who publicly struggled with their faith, and grew a stronger and more personal connection to God through their doubt. Moreover, scholars like Darren J. N. Middleton argue that Kazantzakis&#x27;s interpretation of the Christian faith predated the more modern, personalized interpretation of Christianity that has become popular in the years after Kazantzakis&#x27;s death.

<doc id="51420" wikidata="Q104334" url="?curid=51420" title="Carbonic acid">
<text>Carbonic acid is a chemical compound with the chemical formula . The molecule rapidly converts to water and carbon dioxide in the presence of water. However, in the absence of water, it is quite stable at room temperature. The interconversion of carbon dioxide and carbonic acid is related to the breathing cycle of animals and the acidification of natural waters.

In biochemistry and physiology, the name &quot;carbonic acid&quot; is sometimes applied to aqueous solutions of carbon dioxide. These chemical species play an important role in the bicarbonate buffer system, used to maintain acid–base homeostasis.

==Terminology in biochemical literature==
In chemistry, the term &quot;carbonic acid&quot; strictly refers to the chemical compound with the formula . Some biochemistry literature effaces the distinction between carbonic acid and carbon dioxide dissolved in extracellular fluid. 

In physiology, carbon dioxide excreted by the lungs may be called &quot;volatile acid&quot; or &quot;respiratory acid&quot;.

==Anhydrous carbonic acid==
At ambient temperatures, pure carbonic acid is a stable gas. There are two main methods to produce anhydrous carbonic acid: reaction of hydrogen chloride and potassium bicarbonate at 100 K in methanol and proton irradiation of pure solid carbon dioxide. Chemically, it behaves as a diprotic Brønsted acid.

Carbonic acid monomers exhibit three conformational isomers: cis–cis, cis–trans, and trans–trans.

At low temperatures and atmospheric pressure, solid carbonic acid is amorphous and lacks Bragg peaks in X-ray diffraction. But at high pressure, carbonic acid crystallizes, and modern analytical spectroscopy can measure its geometry.

According to neutron diffraction of dideuterated carbonic acid () in a hybrid clamped cell (Russian alloy/copper-beryllium) at 1.85 GPa, the molecules are planar and form dimers joined by pairs of hydrogen bonds. All three C-O bonds are nearly equidistant at 1.34 Å, intermediate between typical C-O and C=O distances (respectively 1.43 and 1.23 Å). The unusual C-O bond lengths are attributed to delocalized π bonding in the molecule&#x27;s center and extraordinarily strong hydrogen bonds. The same effects also induce a very short O—O separation (2.13 Å), through the 136° O-H-O angle imposed by the doubly hydrogen-bonded 8-membered rings. Longer O—O distances are observed in strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds, e.g. in oxalic acid, where the distances exceed 2.4 Å.

==In aqueous solution==
In even a slight presence of water, carbonic acid dehydrates to carbon dioxide and water, which then catalyzes further decomposition. For this reason, carbon dioxide can be considered the carbonic acid anhydride.

The hydration equilibrium constant at 25 °C is in pure water and ≈ 1.2×10−3 in seawater. Hence the majority of carbon dioxide at geophysical or biological air-water interfaces does not convert to carbonic acid, remaining dissolved gas. However, the uncatalyzed equilibrium is reached quite slowly: the rate constants are 0.039 s−1 for hydration and 23 s−1 for dehydration.

===In biological solutions===
In the presence of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, equilibrium is instead reached rapidly, and the following reaction takes precedence: &lt;chem display=block&gt;HCO3^- {+} H^+ &lt;=&gt; CO2 {+} H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

When the created carbon dioxide exceeds its solubility, gas evolves and a third equilibrium &lt;chem display=block&gt;CO_2 (soln) &lt;=&gt; CO_2 (g)&lt;/chem&gt; must also be taken into consideration. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is defined by Henry&#x27;s law. 

The two reactions can be combined for the equilibrium in solution: formula_1 When Henry&#x27;s law is used to calculate the denominator care is needed with regard to units since Henry&#x27;s law constant can be commonly expressed with 8 different dimensionalities.

=== In water pH control ===
In wastewater treatment and agriculture irrigation, carbonic acid is used to acidify the water similar to sulfuric acid and sulfurous acid produced by sulfur burners.

=== Under high CO2 partial pressure ===
In the beverage industry, sparkling or &quot;fizzy water&quot; is usually referred to as carbonated water. It is made by dissolving carbon dioxide under a small positive pressure in water. Many soft drinks treated the same way effervesce.

Significant amounts of molecular exist in aqueous solutions subjected to pressures of multiple gigapascals (tens of thousands of atmospheres) in planetary interiors. Pressures of 0.6–1.6 GPa at 100 K, and 0.75–1.75 GPa at 300 K are attained in the cores of large icy satellites such as Ganymede, Callisto, and Titan, where water and carbon dioxide are present. Pure carbonic acid, being denser, is expected to have sunk under the ice layers and separate them from the rocky cores of these moons.

== Relationship to bicarbonate and carbonate ==

Carbonic acid is the formal Brønsted–Lowry conjugate acid of the bicarbonate anion, stable in alkaline solution. The protonation constants have been measured to great precision, but depend on overall ionic strength . The two equilibria most easily measured are as follows: formula_2 where brackets indicate the concentration of species. At 25 °C, these equilibria empirically satisfyformula_3 decreases with increasing , as does . In a solution absent other ions (e.g. ), these curves imply the following stepwise dissociation constants:formula_4 Direct values for these constants in the literature include and .

To interpret these numbers, note that two chemical species in an acid equilibrium are equiconcentrated when . In particular, the extracellular fluid (cytosol) in biological systems exhibits , so that carbonic acid will be almost 50%-dissociated at equilibrium.

=== Ocean acidification ===
The Bjerrum plot shows typical equilibrium concentrations, in solution, in seawater, of carbon dioxide and the various species derived from it, as a function of pH. As human industrialization has increased the proportion of carbon dioxide in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, the proportion of carbon dioxide dissolved in sea- and freshwater as carbonic acid is also expected to increase. This rise in dissolved acid is also expected to acidify those waters, generating a decrease in pH. It has been estimated that the increase in dissolved carbon dioxide has already caused the ocean&#x27;s average surface pH to decrease by about 0.1 from pre-industrial levels.

<doc id="51421" wikidata="Q2297602" url="?curid=51421" title="Integer sequence">
<text>In mathematics, an integer sequence is a sequence (i.e., an ordered list) of integers.

An integer sequence may be specified &quot;explicitly&quot; by giving a formula for its &quot;n&quot;th term, or &quot;implicitly&quot; by giving a relationship between its terms. For example, the sequence 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... (the Fibonacci sequence) is formed by starting with 0 and 1 and then adding any two consecutive terms to obtain the next one: an implicit description . The sequence 0, 3, 8, 15, ... is formed according to the formula &quot;n&quot;2 − 1 for the &quot;n&quot;th term: an explicit definition.

Alternatively, an integer sequence may be defined by a property which members of the sequence possess and other integers do not possess. For example, we can determine whether a given integer is a perfect number, , even though we do not have a formula for the &quot;n&quot;th perfect number.

==Computable and definable sequences==
An integer sequence is computable if there exists an algorithm that, given &quot;n&quot;, calculates &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;, for all &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0. The set of computable integer sequences is countable. The set of all integer sequences is uncountable (with cardinality equal to that of the continuum), and so not all integer sequences are computable.

Although some integer sequences have definitions, there is no systematic way to define what it means for an integer sequence to be definable in the universe or in any absolute (model independent) sense.

Suppose the set &quot;M&quot; is a transitive model of ZFC set theory. The transitivity of M implies that the integers and integer sequences inside M are actually integers and sequences of integers. An integer sequence is a definable sequence relative to &quot;M&quot; if there exists some formula &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) in the language of set theory, with one free variable and no parameters, which is true in &quot;M&quot; for that integer sequence and false in &quot;M&quot; for all other integer sequences. In each such &quot;M&quot;, there are definable integer sequences that are not computable, such as sequences that encode the Turing jumps of computable sets.

For some transitive models &quot;M&quot; of ZFC, every sequence of integers in &quot;M&quot; is definable relative to &quot;M&quot;; for others, only some integer sequences are. There is no systematic way to define in &quot;M&quot; itself the set of sequences definable relative to &quot;M&quot; and that set may not even exist in some such &quot;M&quot;. Similarly, the map from the set of formulas that define integer sequences in &quot;M&quot; to the integer sequences they define is not definable in &quot;M&quot; and may not exist in &quot;M&quot;. However, in any model that does possess such a definability map, some integer sequences in the model will not be definable relative to the model.

If &quot;M&quot; contains all integer sequences, then the set of integer sequences definable in &quot;M&quot; will exist in &quot;M&quot; and be countable and countable in &quot;M&quot;.

==Complete sequences==
A sequence of positive integers is called a complete sequence if every positive integer can be expressed as a sum of values in the sequence, using each value at most once.

==Examples==
Integer sequences that have their own name include:

*Abundant numbers
*Baum–Sweet sequence

*Binomial coefficients
*Carmichael numbers
*Catalan numbers
*Composite numbers
*Deficient numbers
*Euler numbers
*Even and odd numbers
*Factorial numbers
*Fibonacci numbers
*Fibonacci word
*Figurate numbers
*Golomb sequence
*Happy numbers
*Highly composite numbers
*Highly totient numbers
*Home primes
*Hyperperfect numbers
*Juggler sequence
*Kolakoski sequence
*Lucky numbers
*Lucas numbers
*Motzkin numbers
*Natural numbers
*Padovan numbers
*Partition numbers
*Perfect numbers
*Practical numbers
*Prime numbers
*Pseudoprime numbers
*Recamán&#x27;s sequence
*Regular paperfolding sequence
*Rudin–Shapiro sequence
*Semiperfect numbers

<text>In number theory, given a prime number , the -adic numbers form an extension of the rational numbers which is distinct from the real numbers, though with some similar properties; -adic numbers can be written in a form similar to (possibly infinite) decimals, but with digits based on a prime number rather than ten, and extending to the left rather than to the right.

For example, comparing the expansion of the rational number formula_1 in base vs. the -adic expansion,
: formula_2

Formally, given a prime number , a -adic number can be defined as a series
: formula_3
where is an integer (possibly negative), and each formula_4 is an integer such that formula_5 A -adic integer is a -adic number such that formula_6

In general the series that represents a -adic number is not convergent in the usual sense, but it is convergent for the -adic absolute value formula_7 where is the least integer such that formula_8 (if all formula_4 are zero, one has the zero -adic number, which has as its -adic absolute value).

Every rational number can be uniquely expressed as the sum of a series as above, with respect to the -adic absolute value. This allows considering rational numbers as special -adic numbers, and alternatively defining the -adic numbers as the completion of the rational numbers for the -adic absolute value, exactly as the real numbers are the completion of the rational numbers for the usual absolute value.

-adic numbers were first described by Kurt Hensel in 1897, though, with hindsight, some of Ernst Kummer&#x27;s earlier work can be interpreted as implicitly using -adic numbers.

== Motivation ==

Roughly speaking, modular arithmetic modulo a positive integer consists of &quot;approximating&quot; every integer by the remainder of its division by , called its &quot;residue modulo&quot; . The main property of modular arithmetic is that the residue modulo of the result of a succession of operations on integers is the same as the result of the same succession of operations on residues modulo . If one knows that the absolute value of the result is less than , this allows a computation of the result which does not involve any integer larger than .

For larger results, an old method, still in common use, consists of using several small moduli that are pairwise coprime, and applying the Chinese remainder theorem for recovering the result modulo the product of the moduli.

Another method discovered by Kurt Hensel consists of using a prime modulus , and applying Hensel&#x27;s lemma for recovering iteratively the result modulo formula_10 If the process is continued infinitely, this provides eventually a result which is a -adic number.

== Basic lemmas ==

The theory of -adic numbers is fundamentally based on the two following lemmas:

&quot;Every nonzero rational number can be written formula_11 where , , and are integers and neither nor is divisible by .&quot; The exponent is uniquely determined by the rational number and is called its &quot;-adic valuation&quot; (this definition is a particular case of a more general definition, given below). The proof of the lemma results directly from the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

&quot;Every nonzero rational number of valuation can be uniquely written formula_12 where is a rational number of valuation greater than , and is an integer such that formula_13 where and are integers coprime with . 
By Bezout lemma, there exist integers and , with formula_14, such that 
formula_15 Setting formula_16 (hence formula_17), we have
:formula_18

To show the uniqueness of this representation, observe that if formula_19 with 
formula_20 and formula_21,
there holds by difference formula_22 with formula_23 and formula_24.
Write formula_25, where is coprime to ; then 
formula_26, which is possible only if formula_27 and formula_28.
Hence formula_29 and formula_30. 

The above process can be iterated starting from instead of , giving the following.

&quot;Given a nonzero rational number of valuation and a positive integer , there are a rational number formula_31 of nonnegative valuation and uniquely defined nonnegative integers formula_32 less than such that formula_33 and&quot;
: formula_34

The -adic numbers are essentially obtained by continuing this infinitely to produce an infinite series.

== &quot;p&quot;-adic series ==

The -adic numbers are commonly defined by means of -adic series.

A &quot;-adic series&quot; is a formal power series of the form 
: formula_35
where formula_36 is an integer and the formula_37 are rational numbers that either are zero or have a nonnegative valuation (that is, the denominator of formula_37 is not divisible by ).

Every rational number may be viewed as a -adic series with a single nonzero term, consisting of its factorization of the form formula_39 with and both coprime with .

Two -adic series formula_40 and formula_41
are &quot;equivalent&quot; if there is an integer such that, for every integer formula_42 the rational number 
: formula_43 
is zero or has a -adic valuation greater than .

A -adic series formula_44 is &quot;normalized&quot; if either all formula_4 are integers such that formula_46 or all formula_4 are zero. In the latter case, the series is called the &quot;zero series&quot;.

Every -adic series is equivalent to exactly one normalized series. This normalized series is obtained by a sequence of transformations, which are equivalences of series; see § Normalization of a -adic series, below.

In other words, the equivalence of -adic series is an equivalence relation, and each equivalence class contains exactly one normalized -adic series.

The usual operations of series (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are compatible with equivalence of -adic series. That is, denoting the equivalence with , if , and are nonzero -adic series such that formula_48 one has
: formula_49

The -adic numbers are often defined as the equivalence classes of -adic series, in a similar way as the definition of the real numbers as equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences. The uniqueness property of normalization, allows uniquely representing any -adic number by the corresponding normalized -adic series. The compatibility of the series equivalence leads almost immediately to basic properties of -adic numbers:
* &quot;Addition&quot;, &quot;multiplication&quot; and multiplicative inverse of -adic numbers are defined as for formal power series, followed by the normalization of the result. 
* With these operations, the -adic numbers form a field, which is an extension field of the rational numbers.
* The &quot;valuation&quot; of a nonzero -adic number , commonly denoted formula_50 is the exponent of in the first non zero term of the corresponding normalized series; the valuation of zero is formula_51
* The &quot;-adic absolute value&quot; of a nonzero -adic number , is formula_52 for the zero -adic number, one has formula_53

=== Normalization of a &quot;p&quot;-adic series ===
Starting with the series formula_54 the first above lemma allows getting an equivalent series such that the -adic valuation of formula_55 is zero. For that, one considers the first nonzero formula_56 If its -adic valuation is zero, it suffices to change into , that is to start the summation from . Otherwise, the -adic valuation of formula_37 is formula_58 and formula_59 where the valuation of formula_60 is zero; so, one gets an equivalent series by changing formula_37 to and formula_62 to formula_63 Iterating this process, one gets eventually, possibly after infinitely many steps, an equivalent series that either is the zero series or is a series such that the valuation of formula_55 is zero.

Then, if the series is not normalized, consider the first nonzero formula_37 that is not an integer in the interval formula_66 The second above lemma allows writing it formula_67 one gets n equivalent series by replacing formula_37 with formula_69 and adding formula_60 to formula_71 Iterating this process, possibly infinitely many times, provides eventually the desired normalized -adic series.

== Definition ==
There are several equivalent definitions of -adic numbers. The one that is given here is relatively elementary, since it does not involve any other mathematical concepts than those introduced in the preceding sections. Other equivalent definitions use completion of a discrete valuation ring (see ), completion of a metric space (see ), or inverse limits (see ).

A -adic number can be defined as a &quot;normalized -adic series&quot;. Since there are other equivalent definitions that are commonly used, one says often that a normalized -adic series &quot;represents&quot; a -adic number, instead of saying that it &quot;is&quot; a -adic number.

One can say also that any -adic series represents a -adic number, since every -adic series is equivalent to a unique normalized -adic series. This is useful for defining operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) of -adic numbers: the result of such an operation is obtained by normalizing the result of the corresponding operation on series. This well defines operations on -adic numbers, since the series operations are compatible with equivalence of -adic series.
With these operations, -adic numbers form a field called the field of -adic numbers and denoted formula_72 or formula_73 There is a unique field homomorphism from the rational numbers into the -adic numbers, which maps a rational number to its -adic expansion. The image of this homomorphism is commonly identified with the field of rational numbers. This allows considering the -adic numbers as an extension field of the rational numbers, and the rational numbers as a subfield of the -adic numbers.

The &quot;valuation&quot; of a nonzero -adic number , commonly denoted formula_74 is the exponent of in the first nonzero term of every -adic series that represents . By convention, formula_75 that is, the valuation of zero is formula_76 This valuation is a discrete valuation. The restriction of this valuation to the rational numbers is the -adic valuation of formula_77 that is, the exponent in the factorization of a rational number as formula_78 with both and coprime with .

== &quot;p&quot;-adic integers ==
The -adic integers are the -adic numbers with a nonnegative valuation.

A formula_79-adic integer can be represented as a sequence
: formula_80
of residues formula_81 mod formula_82 for each integer formula_83, satisfying the compatibility relations formula_84 for formula_85.

Every integer is a formula_79-adic integer (including zero, since formula_87). The rational numbers of the form formula_88 with formula_89 coprime with formula_79 and formula_91 are also formula_79-adic integers (for the reason that formula_89 has an inverse mod formula_82 for every formula_83).

The -adic integers form a commutative ring, denoted formula_96 or formula_97, that has the following properties.
* It is an integral domain, since it is a subring of a field, or since the first term of the series representation of the product of two non zero -adic series is the product of their first terms.
* The units (invertible elements) of formula_96 are the -adic numbers of valuation zero.
* It is a principal ideal domain, such that each ideal is generated by a power of .
* It is a local ring of Krull dimension one, since its only prime ideals are the zero ideal and the ideal generated by , the unique maximal ideal.
* It is a discrete valuation ring, since this results from the preceding properties.
* It is the completion of the local ring formula_99 which is the localization of formula_100 at the prime ideal formula_101

The last property provides a definition of the -adic numbers that is equivalent to the above one: the field of the -adic numbers is the field of fractions of the completion of the localization of the integers at the prime ideal generated by .

== Topological properties ==
The -adic valuation allows defining an absolute value on -adic numbers: the -adic absolute value of a nonzero -adic number is
: formula_102
where formula_50 is the -adic valuation of . The -adic absolute value of formula_104 is formula_105 This is an absolute value that satisfies the strong triangle inequality since, for every and one has
* formula_106 if and only if formula_107
* formula_108 
* formula_109

Moreover, if formula_110 one has formula_111

This makes the -adic numbers a metric space, and even an ultrametric space, with the -adic distance defined by
formula_112

As a metric space, the -adic numbers form the completion of the rational numbers equipped with the -adic absolute value. This provides another way for defining the -adic numbers. However, the general construction of a completion can be simplified in this case, because the metric is defined by a discrete valuation (in short, one can extract from every Cauchy sequence a subsequence such that the differences between two consecutive terms have strictly decreasing absolute values; such a subsequence is the sequence of the partial sums of a -adic series, and thus a unique normalized -adic series can be associated to every equivalence class of Cauchy sequences; so, for building the completion, it suffices to consider normalized -adic series instead of equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences).

As the metric is defined from a discrete valuation, every open ball is also closed. More precisely, the open ball formula_113 equals the closed ball formula_114 where is the least integer such that formula_115 Similarly, formula_116 where is the greatest integer such that formula_117

This implies that the -adic numbers form a locally compact space, and the -adic integers—that is, the ball formula_118—form a compact space.

== &quot;p&quot;-adic expansion of rational numbers ==

The decimal expansion of a positive rational number formula_119 is its representation as a series
:formula_120
where formula_121 is an integer and each formula_4 is also an integer such that formula_123 This expansion can be computed by long division of the numerator by the denominator, which is itself based on the following theorem: If formula_124 is a rational number such that formula_125 there is an integer formula_126 such that formula_127 and formula_128 with formula_129 The decimal expansion is obtained by repeatedly applying this result to the remainder formula_130 which in the iteration assumes the role of the original rational number formula_119.

The -&quot;adic expansion&quot; of a rational number is defined similarly, but with a different division step. More precisely, given a fixed prime number formula_79, every nonzero rational number formula_119 can be uniquely written as formula_134 where formula_121 is a (possibly negative) integer, formula_136 and formula_89 are coprime integers both coprime with formula_79, and formula_89 is positive. The integer formula_121 is the -adic valuation of formula_119, denoted formula_142 and formula_143 is its -adic absolute value, denoted formula_144 (the absolute value is small when the valuation is large). The division step consists of writing
: formula_145
where formula_126 is an integer such that &lt;math&gt;0\le a and formula_130 is either zero, or a rational number such that formula_148 (that is, formula_149).

The formula_79-&quot;adic expansion&quot; of formula_119 is the formal power series 
: formula_152
obtained by repeating indefinitely the above division step on successive remainders. In a -adic expansion, all formula_4 are integers such that formula_154 with formula_155, the process stops eventually with a zero remainder; in this case, the series is completed by trailing terms with a zero coefficient, and is the representation of formula_119 in base-.

The existence and the computation of the -adic expansion of a rational number results from Bézout&#x27;s identity in the following way. If, as above, formula_157 and formula_89 and formula_79 are coprime, there exist integers formula_160 and formula_161 such that formula_162 So
: formula_163
Then, the Euclidean division of formula_164 by formula_79 gives
: formula_166
with formula_167
so that in the iteration
: formula_168
is the new rational number.

The uniqueness of the division step and of the whole -adic expansion is easy: if formula_169 one has formula_170 This means formula_79 divides formula_172 Since formula_173 and formula_174 and since formula_79 divides formula_176 it must be that formula_177

The -adic expansion of a rational number is a series that converges to the rational number, if one applies the definition of a convergent series with the -adic absolute value.
In the standard -adic notation, the digits are written in the same order as in a standard base- system, namely with the powers of the base increasing to the left. This means that the production of the digits is reversed and the limit happens on the left hand side.

The -adic expansion of a rational number is eventually periodic. Conversely, a series formula_178 with formula_179 Bézout&#x27;s identity for 5 and the denominator 3 is formula_180 (for larger examples, this can be computed with the extended Euclidean algorithm). Thus
: formula_181
For the next step, one has to expand formula_182 (the factor 5 has to be viewed as a &quot;shift&quot; of the -adic valuation, similar to the basis of any number expansion, and thus it should not be itself expanded). To expand formula_182, we start from the same Bézout&#x27;s identity and multiply it by formula_184, giving
: formula_185
The &quot;integer part&quot; formula_186 is not in the right interval. So, one has to use Euclidean division by formula_187 for getting formula_188 giving
: formula_189
and the expansion in the first step becomes
: formula_190

Similarly, one has 
: formula_191
and
: formula_192

As the &quot;remainder&quot; formula_193 has already been found, the process can be continued easily, giving coefficients formula_194 for odd powers of five, and formula_195 for even powers.
Or in the standard 5-adic notation
: formula_196
with the ellipsis formula_197 on the left hand side.

=== Positional notation ===
It is possible to use a positional notation similar to that which is used to represent numbers in base .

Let formula_198 be a normalized -adic series, i.e. each formula_4 is an integer in the interval formula_66 One can suppose that formula_201 by setting formula_202 for formula_203 (if formula_204), and adding the resulting zero terms to the series.

If formula_205 the positional notation consists of writing the formula_4 consecutively, ordered by decreasing values of , often with appearing on the right as an index:
: formula_207
So, the computation of the example above shows that 
: formula_208
and 
: formula_209
When formula_210 a separating dot is added before the digits with negative index, and, if the index is present, it appears just after the separating dot. For example,
: formula_211
and
: formula_212

If a -adic representation is finite on the left (that is, formula_202 for large values of ), then it has the value of a nonnegative rational number of the form formula_214 with formula_215 integers. These rational numbers are exactly the nonnegative rational numbers that have a finite representation in base . For these rational numbers, the two representations are the same.

== Modular properties ==
The quotient ring formula_216 may be identified with the ring formula_217 of the integers modulo formula_218 This can be shown by remarking that every -adic integer, represented by its normalized -adic series, is congruent modulo formula_219 with its partial sum formula_220 whose value is an integer in the interval formula_221 A straightforward verification shows that this defines a ring isomorphism from formula_216 to formula_223

The inverse limit of the rings formula_216 is defined as the ring formed by the sequences formula_225 such that formula_226 and formula_227 for every .

The mapping that maps a normalized -adic series to the sequence of its partial sums is a ring isomorphism from formula_96 to the inverse limit of the formula_229 This provides another way for defining -adic integers (up to an isomorphism).

This definition of -adic integers is specially useful for practical computations, as allowing building -adic integers by successive approximations.

For example, for computing the -adic (multiplicative) inverse of an integer, one can use Newton&#x27;s method, starting from the inverse modulo ; then, each Newton step computes the inverse modulo formula_230 from the inverse modulo formula_231

The same method can be used for computing the -adic square root of an integer that is a quadratic residue modulo . This seems to be the fastest known method for testing whether a large integer is a square: it suffices to test whether the given integer is the square of the value found in formula_216. Applying Newton&#x27;s method to find the square root requires formula_233 to be larger than twice the given integer, which is quickly satisfied.

Hensel lifting is a similar method that allows to &quot;lift&quot; the factorization modulo of a polynomial with integer coefficients to a factorization modulo formula_233 for large values of . This is commonly used by polynomial factorization algorithms.

== Notation ==
There are several different conventions for writing -adic expansions. So far this article has used a notation for -adic expansions in which powers of increase from right to left. With this right-to-left notation the 3-adic expansion of formula_235 for example, is written as
: formula_236

When performing arithmetic in this notation, digits are carried to the left. It is also possible to write -adic expansions so that the powers of increase from left to right, and digits are carried to the right. With this left-to-right notation the 3-adic expansion of formula_1 is
: formula_238

-adic expansions may be written with other sets of digits instead of  }. For example, the -adic expansion of formula_1 can be written using balanced ternary digits }, with representing negative one, as
: formula_240

In fact any set of integers which are in distinct residue classes modulo may be used as -adic digits. In number theory, Teichmüller representatives are sometimes used as digits.

 is a variant of the -adic representation of rational numbers that was proposed in 1979 by Eric Hehner and Nigel Horspool for implementing on computers the (exact) arithmetic with these numbers.

== Cardinality ==
Both formula_96 and formula_72 are uncountable and have the cardinality of the continuum. For formula_243 this results from the -adic representation, which defines a bijection of formula_96 on the power set formula_245 For formula_72 this results from its expression as a countably infinite union of copies of formula_96:
: formula_248

== Algebraic closure ==

formula_72 contains formula_250 and is a field of characteristic .

Because can be written as sum of squares, formula_72 cannot be turned into an ordered field.

The field of real numbers formula_252 has only a single proper algebraic extension: the complex numbers formula_253. In other words, this quadratic extension is already algebraically closed. By contrast, the algebraic closure of formula_72, denoted formula_255 has infinite degree, that is, formula_72 has infinitely many inequivalent algebraic extensions. Also contrasting the case of real numbers, although there is a unique extension of the -adic valuation to formula_255 the latter is not (metrically) complete. Its (metric) completion is called formula_258 or formula_259. Here an end is reached, as formula_258 is algebraically closed. However unlike formula_253 this field is not locally compact.

formula_258 and formula_253 are isomorphic as rings, so we may regard formula_258 as formula_253 endowed with an exotic metric. The proof of existence of such a field isomorphism relies on the axiom of choice, and does not provide an explicit example of such an isomorphism (that is, it is not constructive).

If formula_266 is any finite Galois extension of formula_267, the Galois group formula_268 is solvable. Thus, the Galois group formula_269 is prosolvable.

== Multiplicative group ==
formula_72 contains the -th cyclotomic field () if and only if . For instance, the -th cyclotomic field is a subfield of formula_271 if and only if , or . In particular, there is no multiplicative -torsion in formula_72 if . Also, is the only non-trivial torsion element in formula_273.

Given a natural number , the index of the multiplicative group of the -th powers of the non-zero elements of formula_72 in formula_275 is finite.

The number , defined as the sum of reciprocals of factorials, is not a member of any -adic field; but formula_276 for formula_277. For one must take at least the fourth power. (Thus a number with similar properties as — namely a -th root of — is a member of formula_72 for all .)

== Local–global principle ==
Helmut Hasse&#x27;s local–global principle is said to hold for an equation if it can be solved over the rational numbers if and only if it can be solved over the real numbers and over the -adic numbers for every prime . This principle holds, for example, for equations given by quadratic forms, but fails for higher polynomials in several indeterminates.

== Rational arithmetic with Hensel lifting ==
== Generalizations and related concepts ==
The reals and the -adic numbers are the completions of the rationals; it is also possible to complete other fields, for instance general algebraic number fields, in an analogous way. This will be described now.

Suppose &quot;D&quot; is a Dedekind domain and &quot;E&quot; is its field of fractions. Pick a non-zero prime ideal &quot;P&quot; of &quot;D&quot;. If &quot;x&quot; is a non-zero element of &quot;E&quot;, then &quot;xD&quot; is a fractional ideal and can be uniquely factored as a product of positive and negative powers of non-zero prime ideals of &quot;D&quot;. We write ord&quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) for the exponent of &quot;P&quot; in this factorization, and for any choice of number &quot;c&quot; greater than 1 we can set
:formula_279
Completing with respect to this absolute value |⋅|&quot;P&quot; yields a field &quot;E&quot;&quot;P&quot;, the proper generalization of the field of &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers to this setting. The choice of &quot;c&quot; does not change the completion (different choices yield the same concept of Cauchy sequence, so the same completion). It is convenient, when the residue field &quot;D&quot;/&quot;P&quot; is finite, to take for &quot;c&quot; the size of &quot;D&quot;/&quot;P&quot;.

For example, when &quot;E&quot; is a number field, Ostrowski&#x27;s theorem says that every non-trivial non-Archimedean absolute value on &quot;E&quot; arises as some |⋅|&quot;P&quot;. The remaining non-trivial absolute values on &quot;E&quot; arise from the different embeddings of &quot;E&quot; into the real or complex numbers. (In fact, the non-Archimedean absolute values can be considered as simply the different embeddings of &quot;E&quot; into the fields C&quot;p&quot;, thus putting the description of all
the non-trivial absolute values of a number field on a common footing.)

Often, one needs to simultaneously keep track of all the above-mentioned completions when &quot;E&quot; is a number field (or more generally a global field), which are seen as encoding &quot;local&quot; information. This is accomplished by adele rings and idele groups.

&quot;p&quot;-adic integers can be extended to &quot;p&quot;-adic solenoids formula_280. There is a map from formula_280 to the circle group whose fibers are the &quot;p&quot;-adic integers formula_282, in analogy to how there is a map from formula_283 to the circle whose fibers are formula_284.

<doc id="51425" wikidata="Q34754" url="?curid=51425" title="Somaliland">
<text>Somaliland, officially the Republic of Somaliland, is an unrecognised country in the Horn of Africa. It is located in the southern coast of the Gulf of Aden and bordered by Djibouti to the northwest, Ethiopia to the south and west, and Somalia to the east. Its claimed territory has an area of , with approximately 6.2 million people as of 2024. The capital and largest city is Hargeisa.

Various Somali Muslim kingdoms were established in the area during the early Islamic period, including in the 14th to 15th centuries the Zeila-based Adal Sultanate. In the early modern period, successor states to the Adal Sultanate emerged, including the Isaaq Sultanate which was established in the middle of the 18th century. In the late 19th century, the United Kingdom signed agreements with various clans in the area, establishing the Somaliland Protectorate, which was formally granted independence by the United Kingdom as the State of Somaliland on 26 June 1960. Five days later, the State of Somaliland voluntarily united with the Trust Territory of Somalia (the former Italian Somalia) to form the Somali Republic. The union of the two states proved problematic early on, and in response to the harsh policies enacted by Somalia&#x27;s Barre regime against the main clan family in Somaliland, the Isaaq, shortly after the conclusion of the disastrous Ogaden War, a 10-year war of independence concluded with the declaration of Somaliland&#x27;s independence in 1991. The Government of Somaliland regards itself as the successor state to British Somaliland.

Since 1991, the territory has been governed by democratically elected governments that seek international recognition as the government of the Republic of Somaliland. The central government maintains informal ties with some foreign governments, who have sent delegations to Hargeisa; Somaliland hosts representative offices from several countries, including Ethiopia and Taiwan. However, Somaliland&#x27;s self-proclaimed independence has not been officially recognised by any UN member state or international organisation. It is the largest unrecognised state in the world by &quot;de facto&quot; controlled land area. It is a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, an advocacy group whose members consist of indigenous peoples, minorities and unrecognised or occupied territories. Following the Las Anod conflict that emerged in 2022, Somaliland lost control of a significant portion of its eastern territory to pro-unionist forces who established the SSC-Khatumo administration.

== Etymology ==

The name &quot;Somaliland&quot; is derived from two words: &quot;Somali&quot; and &quot;land&quot;. The area was named when Britain took control from the Egyptian administration in 1884, after signing successive treaties with the ruling Somali Sultans from the Isaaq, Issa, Gadabursi, and Warsangali clans. The British established a protectorate in the region referred to as British Somaliland. In 1960, when the protectorate became independent from Britain, it was called the State of Somaliland. Five days later, on 1 July 1960, Somaliland united with the Trust Territory of Somaliland under Italian Administration (the former Italian Somaliland). The name &quot;Republic of Somaliland&quot; was adopted upon the declaration of independence following the Somali Civil War in 1991.

At the Grand conference in Burao held in 1991, many names for the country were suggested, including &quot;Puntland&quot;, in reference to Somaliland&#x27;s location in the ancient Land of Punt and which is now the name of the Puntland state in neighbouring Somalia, and &quot;Shankaroon&quot;, meaning &quot;better than five&quot; in Somali, in reference to the five regions of Greater Somalia.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===

The area of Somaliland was inhabited around 10,000 years ago during the Neolithic age. The ancient shepherds raised cows and other livestock and created vibrant rock art paintings. During the Stone Age, the Doian and Hargeisan cultures flourished here. The oldest evidence of burial customs in the Horn of Africa comes from cemeteries in Somaliland dating back to the 4th millennium BCE. The stone implements from the Jalelo site in the north were also characterised in 1909 as important artefacts demonstrating the archaeological universality during the Paleolithic between the East and the West.

According to linguists, the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations arrived in the region during the ensuing Neolithic period from the family&#x27;s proposed urheimat (&quot;original homeland&quot;) in the Nile Valley, or the Near East.

The Laas Geel complex on the outskirts of Hargeisa dates back around 5,000 years, and has rock art depicting both wild animals and decorated cows. Other cave paintings are found in the northern Dhambalin region, which feature one of the earliest known depictions of a hunter on horseback. The rock art is in the distinctive Ethiopian-Arabian style, dated to 1,000 to 3,000 BCE. Additionally, between the towns of Las Khorey and El Ayo in eastern Somaliland lies Karinhegane, the site of numerous cave paintings of real and mythical animals. Each painting has an inscription below it, which collectively have been estimated to be around 2,500 years old.

=== Antiquity and classical era ===
Ancient pyramidical structures, mausoleums, ruined cities and stone walls, such as the Wargaade Wall, are evidence of civilisations thriving in the Somali peninsula. Ancient Somaliland had a trading relationship with ancient Egypt and Mycenaean Greece dating back to at least the second millennium BCE, supporting the hypothesis that Somalia or adjacent regions were the location of the ancient Land of Punt. The Puntites traded myrrh, spices, gold, ebony, short-horned cattle, ivory and frankincense with the Egyptians, Phoenicians, Babylonians, Indians, Chinese and Romans through their commercial ports. An Egyptian expedition sent to Punt by the 18th dynasty Queen Hatshepsut is recorded on the temple reliefs at Deir el-Bahari, during the reign of the Puntite King Parahu and Queen Ati. In 2015, isotopic analysis of ancient baboon mummies from Punt that had been brought to Egypt as gifts indicated that the specimens likely originated from an area encompassing eastern Somalia and the Eritrea-Ethiopia corridor.

The camel is believed to have been domesticated in the Horn region sometime between the 2nd and 3rd millennium BCE. From there, it spread to Egypt and the Maghreb. During the classical period, the northern Barbara city-states of Mosylon, Opone, Mundus, Isis, Malao, Avalites, Essina, Nikon, and Sarapion developed a lucrative trade network, connecting with merchants from Ptolemaic Egypt, Ancient Greece, Phoenicia, Parthian Persia, Saba, the Nabataean Kingdom, and the Roman Empire. They used the ancient Somali maritime vessel known as the &quot;beden&quot; to transport their cargo.

After the Roman conquest of the Nabataean Empire and the establishment of a Roman naval presence at Aden to curb piracy, Arab and Somali merchants cooperated with the Romans to bar Indian ships from trading in the free port cities of the Arabian peninsula to protect the interests of Somali and Arab merchants in the lucrative commerce between the Red and Mediterranean Seas. However, Indian merchants continued to trade in the port cities of the Somali peninsula, which was free from Roman interference.

For centuries, Indian merchants brought large quantities of cinnamon to Somalia and Arabia from Ceylon and the Spice Islands. The source of the spices is said to have been the best-kept secret of Arab and Somali merchants in their trade with the Roman and Greek world; the Romans and Greeks believed the source to have been the Somali peninsula. The collaboration between Somali and Arab traders inflated the price of Indian and Chinese cinnamon in North Africa, the Near East, and Europe, and made the spice trade profitable, especially for the Somali merchants through whose hands large quantities were shipped across sea and land routes.

In 2007, more rock art sites with Sabaean and Himyarite writings in and around Hargeisa were found, but some were bulldozed by developers.

=== Birth of Islam and the Middle Ages ===
The Isaaq people traditionally claim to have descended from Sheikh Ishaaq bin Ahmed, an Islamic scholar who purportedly traveled to Somaliland in the 12th or 13th century and married two women; one from the local Dir clanand the other from the neighboring Harari people. He is said to have sired eight sons who are the common ancestors of the clans of the Isaaq clan-family. He remained in Maydh until his death.

As the Isaaq clan-family grew in size and numbers during the 12th century, the clan-family migrated and spread from their core area in Mait (Maydh) and the wider Sanaag region in a southwestward expansion over a wide portion of present-day Somaliland by the 15th and 16th centuries. As the Isaaq expanded the earlier Dir communities of Mait and the wider Sanaag region were driven westwards and to the south towards their present positions. In this general expansion the Isaaq split up into their present component segments, however one fraction of the Habar Yunis clan, the Muse &#x27;Arre, remains behind in Mait as the custodians of the tomb of Sheikh Ishaaq. By the 1300s the Isaaq clans united to defend their inhabited territories and resources during clan conflicts against migrating clans.

After the war, the Isaaq clans (along with other tribes like the Daarood) grew in numbers and territory in the northeast, causing them to began to vie with their Oromo neighbours, who were expanding northwards themselves after the Great Oromo Migrations, thus creating a general thrust toward the southwest. The Isaaq, along with Darood subclans pushed westwards into the plains of Jigjiga and further, beyond where they played a important role in the Adal Sultanate&#x27;s campaigns against Christian Abyssinia. By the 16th to 17th century the movements that followed seem to have established the Isaaqs on coastal Somaliland.

Various Somali Muslim kingdoms were established in the area in the early Islamic period. In the 14th century, the Zeila-based Adal Sultanate battled the forces of the Ethiopian emperor Amda Seyon I. The Ottoman Empire later occupied Berbera and environs in the 1500s. Muhammad Ali, Pasha of Egypt, subsequently established a foothold in the area between 1821 and 1841.

The Sanaag region is home to the ruined Islamic city of Maduna near El Afweyn, which is considered the most substantial and accessible ruin of its type in Somaliland. The main feature of the ruined city is a large rectangular mosque, its 3-metre high walls still standing, which include a mihrab and possibly several smaller arched niches. Swedish-Somali archaeologist Sada Mire dates the ruined city to the 15th–17th centuries.

=== Early modern sultanates ===

==== Isaaq Sultanate ====
In the early modern period, successor states to the Adal Sultanate began to flourish in Somaliland. These included the Isaaq Sultanate and Habr Yunis Sultanate. The Isaaq Sultanate was a Somali kingdom that ruled parts of the Horn of Africa during the 18th and 19th centuries. It spanned the territories of the Isaaq clan, descendants of the Banu Hashim clan, in modern-day Somaliland and Ethiopia. The sultanate was governed by the Rer Guled branch established by the first sultan, Sultan Guled Abdi, of the Eidagale clan. The sultanate is the pre-colonial predecessor to the modern Republic of Somaliland.

According to oral tradition, prior to the Guled dynasty the Isaaq clan-family were ruled by a dynasty of the Tolje&#x27;lo branch descending from Ahmed nicknamed Tol Je&#x27;lo, the eldest son of Sheikh Ishaaq&#x27;s Harari wife. There were eight Tolje&#x27;lo rulers in total, starting with Boqor Harun () who ruled the Isaaq Sultanate for centuries starting from the 13th century. The last Tolje&#x27;lo ruler Garad Dhuh Barar () was overthrown by a coalition of Isaaq clans. The once strong Tolje&#x27;lo clan were scattered and took refuge among the Habr Awal with whom they still mostly live.

The Sultan of Isaaq regularly convened &quot;shirs&quot; (meetings) where he would be informed and advised by leading elders or religious figures on what decisions to make. In the case of the Dervish movement, Sultan Deria Hassan had chosen not to join after receiving counsel from Sheikh Madar. He addressed early tensions between the Saad Musa and Eidagale upon the former&#x27;s settlement into the growing town of Hargeisa in the late 19th century. The Sultan was also responsible for organising grazing rights and, in the late 19th century, new agricultural spaces. The allocation of resources and sustainable use of them was also a matter that Sultans concerned themselves with and was crucial in this arid region. In the 1870s, at a famous meeting between Sheikh Madar and Sultan Deria, it was proclaimed that hunting and tree cutting in the vicinity of Hargeisa would be banned, and that the holy relics from Aw Barkhadle would be brought and oaths would be sworn on them by the Isaaqs in the presence of the Sultan whenever internal combat broke out.

Aside from the leading Sultan of Isaaq there were numerous Akils, Garaads and subordinate Sultans alongside religious authorities that constituted the Sultanate; occasionally these would declare their independence or simply break from its authority.

The Isaaq Sultanate had 5 rulers prior to the creation of British Somaliland in 1884. Historically, Sultans would be chosen by a committee of several important members of the various Isaaq subclans. Sultans were usually buried at Toon, south of Hargeisa, which was a significant site and the capital of the Sultanate during Farah Guled&#x27;s rule.

==== Battle of Berbera ====
The first engagement between Somalis of the region and the British was in 1825 and led to hostilities, ending in the Battle of Berbera and a subsequent trade agreement between the Habr Awal and the United Kingdom. This was followed by a British treaty with the Governor of Zeila in 1840. An engagement was then started between the British and elders of Habar Garhajis and Habar Toljaala clans of the Isaaq in 1855, followed a year later by the conclusion of the &quot;Articles of Peace and Friendship&quot; between the Habar Awal and East India Company. These engagements between the British and Somali clans culminated in the formal treaties the British signed with the henceforth &#x27;British Somaliland&#x27; clans, which took place between 1884 and 1886 (treaties were signed with the Habar Awal, Gadabursi, Habar Toljaala, Habar Garhajis, Esa, and the Warsangali clans), and paved the way for the British to establish a protectorate in the region referred to as British Somaliland. The British garrisoned the protectorate from Aden and administered it as part of British India until 1898. British Somaliland was then administered by the Foreign Office until 1905, and afterwards by the Colonial Office.

=== British Somaliland ===
The Somaliland Campaign, also called the Anglo-Somali War or the Dervish War, was a series of military expeditions that took place between 1900 and 1920 in the Horn of Africa, pitting the Dervishes led by Mohammed Abdullah Hassan (nicknamed the &quot;Mad Mullah&quot;) against the British. The British were assisted in their offensives by the Ethiopians and Italians. During the First World War (1914–1918), Hassan also received aid from the Ottomans, Germans and, for a time, from the Emperor Iyasu V of Ethiopia. The conflict ended when the British aerially bombed the Dervish capital of Taleh in February 1920.

The Fifth Expedition of the Somaliland campaign in 1920 was the final British expedition against the Dervish forces of Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, the Somali religious leader. Although most of the combat took place in January of the year, British troops had begun preparations for the assault as early as November 1919. The British forces included elements of the Royal Air Force and the Somaliland Camel Corps. After three weeks of battle, Hassan&#x27;s Dervishes were defeated, bringing an effective end to their 20-year resistance. It was one of the bloodiest and longest militant movements in sub-Saharan Africa during the colonial era, one that overlapped with World War I. The battles between various sides over two decades killed nearly a third of Somaliland&#x27;s population and ravaged the local economy.

The Italian conquest of British Somaliland was a military campaign in East Africa, which took place in August 1940 between forces of Italy and those of several British and Commonwealth countries. The Italian attack was part of the East African campaign.

=== Anti-colonial resistance ===
==== Burao Tax Revolt and RAF bombing ====
The people of Burao clashed with the British in 1922. They revolted in opposition to a new tax that was imposed upon them, rioting and attacking British government officials. This led to a shootout between the British and Burao residents in which Captain Allan Gibb, a Dervish war veteran and district commissioner, was shot and killed. The British requested Sir Winston Churchill, then Secretary of State for the Colonies, to send troops from Aden and Air Force bombers Burao the revolting clans&#x27; livestock. The RAF planes arrived at Burao within two days and proceeded to bomb the town with incendiaries, effectively burning the entire settlement to the ground.

Telegram from Sir Geoffrey Archer, Governor of British Somaliland to Sir Winston Churchill the Secretary of State for the Colonies:
I deeply regret to inform that during an affray at Burao yesterday between Rer Sugulleh and Akils of other tribes Captain Gibb was shot dead. Having called out Camel corps company to quell the disturbance, he went forward himself with his interpreter, whereupon fire opened on him by some Rer segulleh riflemen and he was instantly killed..Miscreants then disappeared under the cover of darkness.
To meet the situation created by the Murder of Gibb, we require two aeroplanes for about fourteen days. I have arranged with resident, Aden, for these. And made formal application, which please confirm. It is proposed they fly via Perim, confining sea crossing to 12 miles. We propose to inflict fine of 2,500 camels on implicated sections, who are practically isolated and demand surrender of man who killed Gibbs. He is known. Fine to be doubled in failure to comply with latter conditions and aeroplanes to be used to bomb stock on grazing grounds.

Sir Winston Churchill reporting on the Burao incident at the House of Commons:

On 25th February the Governor of Somaliland telegraphed that an affray between tribesmen had taken place at Burao on the previous day, in the course of which Captain Allan Gibb, D.S.O., D.C.M., the District Commissioner at Burao, had been shot dead. Captain Gibb had advanced with his interpreter to quell the disturbance, when 1954 fire was opened upon him by some riflemen, and he was instantly killed. The murderers escaped under cover of falling darkness.
Captain Gibb was an officer of long and valued service in Somaliland, whose loss I deeply regret. From the information available, his murder does not appear to have been premeditated, but it inevitably had a disturbing effect upon the surrounding tribes, and immediate dispositions of troops became necessary to ensure the apprehension and punishment of those responsible for the murder. On 27th February the Governor telegraphed that, to meet the situation which had arisen, he required two aeroplanes for purposes of demonstration, and suggested that two aeroplanes from the Royal Air Force Detachment at Aden should fly over to Berber a from Aden. He also telegraphed that in certain circumstances it might become necessary to ask for reinforcements of troops to be sent to the Protectorate.

James Lawrence author of &quot;Imperial Rearguard: Wars of Empire&quot; writes

[Gibb]..was murdered by rioters during a protest against taxation at Burao. Governor Archer immediately called for aircraft which were at Burao within two days. The inhabitants of the native township were turned out of their houses, and the entire area was razed by a combination of bombing, machine-gun fire and burning.

After the RAF aircraft bombed Burao to the ground, the leaders of the rebellion acquiesced, agreeing to pay a fine for Gibb&#x27;s death, but they refused to identify and apprehend the accused individuals. Most of the men responsible for Gibb&#x27;s shooting evaded capture. In light of the failure to implement the taxation without provoking a violent response, the British abandoned the policy altogether.

==== 1945 Sheikh Bashir Rebellion ====
The 1945 Sheikh Bashir Rebellion was a rebellion waged by tribesmen of the Habr Je&#x27;lo clan in the former British Somaliland protectorate against British authorities in July 1945 led by Sheikh Bashir, a Somali religious leader.

On 2 July, Sheikh Bashir collected 25 of his followers in the town of Wadamago and transported them on a lorry to the vicinity of Burao, where he distributed arms to half of his followers. On the evening of 3 July, the group entered Burao and opened fire on the police guard of the central prison in the city, which was filled with prisoners arrested for previous demonstrations. The group also attacked the house of the district commissioner of Burao District, Major Chambers, resulting in the death of Major Chamber&#x27;s police guard before escaping to Bur Dhab, a strategic mountain south-east of Burao, where Sheikh Bashir&#x27;s small unit occupied a fort and took up a defensive position in anticipation of a British counterattack.

The British campaign against Sheikh Bashir&#x27;s troops proved abortive after several defeats as his forces kept moving from place to place and avoiding any permanent location. No sooner had the expedition left the area, than the news travelled fast among the Somali nomads across the plain. The war had exposed the British administration to humiliation. The government came to a conclusion that another expedition against him would be useless; that they must build a railway, make roads and effectively occupy the whole of the protectorate, or else abandon the interior completely. The latter course was decided upon, and during the first months of 1945, the advance posts were withdrawn, and the British administration confined to the coast town of Berbera.

Sheikh Bashir settled many disputes among the tribes in the vicinity, which kept them from raiding each other. He was generally thought to settle disputes through the use of Islamic Sharia and gathered around him a strong following.

The British administration recruited Indian and South African troops, led by police general James David, to fight against Sheikh Bashir and had intelligence plans to capture him alive. The British authorities mobilised a police force, and eventually on 7 July found Sheikh Bashir and his unit in defensive positions behind their fortifications in the mountains of Bur Dhab. After clashes Sheikh Bashir and his second-in-command, Alin Yusuf Ali, nicknamed Qaybdiid, were killed. A third rebel was wounded and was captured along with two other rebels. The rest fled the fortifications and dispersed. On the British side the police general leading the British troops as well as a number of Indian and South African troops perished in the clashes, and a policeman was injured.

After his death, Sheikh Bashir was widely hailed by locals as a martyr and was held in great reverence. His family took quick action to remove his body from the place of his death at Geela-eeg mountain, about 20 miles from Burao.

=== State of Somaliland (Independence) ===


Initially the British government planned to delay protectorate of British Somaliland independence in favour of a gradual transfer of power. The arrangement would allow local politicians to gain more political experience in running the protectorate before official independence. However, strong pan-Somali nationalism and a landslide victory in the earlier elections encouraged them to demand independence and unification with the Trust Territory of Somaliland under Italian Administration (the former Italian Somaliland).

In May 1960, the British government stated that it would be prepared to grant independence to the then protectorate of British Somaliland, with the intention that the territory would unite with the Italian-administered Trust Territory of Somaliland. The Legislative Council of British Somaliland passed a resolution in April 1960 requesting independence and union with the Trust Territory of Somaliland, which was scheduled to gain independence on 1 July that year. The legislative councils of both territories agreed to this proposal following a joint conference in Mogadishu.
On 26 June 1960, the former British Somaliland protectorate briefly obtained independence as the State of Somaliland, with the Trust Territory of Somaliland following suit five days later. During its brief period of independence, the State of Somaliland garnered recognition from thirty-five sovereign states. However, the United States merely acknowledged Somaliland&#x27;s independence:

The United States did not extend formal recognition to Somaliland, but Secretary of State Herter sent a congratulatory message dated June 26 to the Somaliland Council of Ministers.

The following day, on 27 June 1960, the newly convened Somaliland Legislative Assembly approved a bill that would formally allow for the union of the State of Somaliland with the Trust Territory of Somaliland on 1 July 1960.

=== Somali Republic (union with Somalia) ===

On 1 July 1960, the State of Somaliland and the Trust Territory of Somaliland (the former Italian Somaliland) united as planned to form the Somali Republic. Inspired by Somali nationalism, the northerners were initially enthusiastic about the union. A government was formed by Abdullahi Issa, with Aden Abdullah Osman Daar as President and Abdirashid Ali Shermarke as Prime Minister (later becoming president, from 1967 to 1969). On 20 July 1961 and through a popular referendum, the Somali people ratified a new constitution, which was first drafted in 1960. The constitution had little support in the former Somaliland and was believed to favour the south. Many northerners boycotted the referendum in protest, and over 60% of those who voted in the north were against the new constitution. Regardless, the referendum passed, and Somaliland became quickly dominated by southerners. As result, dissatisfaction became widespread in the north, and support for the union plummeted. British-trained Somaliland officers attempted a revolt to end the union in December 1961. Their uprising failed, and Somaliland continued to be marginalised by the south during the next decades.

In 1967, Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal became Prime Minister, a position to which he was appointed by Shermarke. Shermarke was assassinated two years later by one of his own bodyguards. His murder was quickly followed by a military coup d&#x27;état on 21 October 1969 (the day after his funeral), in which the Somalian Army seized power without encountering armed opposition. The putsch was spearheaded by Major General Mohamed Siad Barre, who at the time commanded the army. The new regime would go on to rule Somalia for the next 22 years.

=== Somali National Movement, Barre persecution ===

The moral authority of Barre&#x27;s government was gradually eroded, as many Somalis became disillusioned with life under military rule. By the mid-1980s, resistance movements supported by Ethiopia&#x27;s communist Derg administration had sprung up across the country, which led to the Somaliland War of Independence. Barre responded by ordering punitive measures against those he perceived as locally supporting the guerrillas, especially in the northern regions. The clampdown included bombing of cities, with the northwestern administrative centre of Hargeisa, a Somali National Movement (SNM) stronghold, among the targeted areas in 1988. The bombardment was led by General Mohammed Said Hersi Morgan, Barre&#x27;s son-in-law.

In May 1988, the SNM launched a major offensive on the cities of Hargeisa and Burao, then the second and third largest cities of Somalia. The SNM captured Burao on 27 May within two hours, while the SNM entered Hargeisa on 29 May, overrunning most of the city apart from its airport by 1 June.

According to Abou Jeng and other scholars, the Barre regime rule was marked by a targeted brutal persecution of the Isaaq clan. Mohamed Haji Ingiriis and Chris Mullin state that the clampdown by the Barre regime against the Hargeisa-based Somali National Movement targeted the Isaaq clan, to which most members of the SNM belonged. They refer to the clampdown as the Isaaq Genocide or &quot;Hargeisa Holocaust&quot;. A United Nations investigation concluded that the crime of genocide was . The number of civilian casualties is estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000 according to various sources, while some reports estimate the total civilian deaths to be upwards of 200,000 Isaaq civilians. Along with the deaths, Barre regime bombarded and razed the second and third largest cities in Somalia, Hargeisa and Burao, respectively. This displaced an estimated 400,000 local residents to Hart Sheik in Ethiopia; another 400,000 individuals were also internally displaced.

The counterinsurgency by the Barre regime against the SNM targeted the rebel group&#x27;s civilian base of support, escalating into a genocidal onslaught against the Isaaq clan. This led to anarchy and violent campaigns by fragmented militias, which then wrested power at a local level. The Barre regime&#x27;s persecution was not limited to the Isaaq, as it targeted other clans such as the Hawiye. The Barre regime collapsed in January 1991. Thereafter, as the political situation in Somaliland stabilised, the displaced people returned to their homes, the militias were demobilised or incorporated into the army, and tens of thousands of houses and businesses were reconstructed from rubble.

=== Restoration of sovereignty (end of the unity with Somalia) ===

Although the SNM at its inception had a unionist constitution, it eventually began to pursue independence, looking to secede from the rest of Somalia. Under the leadership of Abdirahman Ahmed Ali Tuur, the local administration declared the northwestern Somali territories independent at a conference held in Burao between 27 April 1991 and 15 May 1991. Tuur then became the newly established Somaliland polity&#x27;s first President, but subsequently renounced the separatist platform in 1994 and began instead to publicly seek and advocate reconciliation with the rest of Somalia under a power-sharing federal system of governance. A brief armed conflict had begun in January 1992 against rebels against Tuur in the period that he was in power, lasting until August 1992, when it was settled by a conference at the town of Sheikh.

Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal was appointed as Tuur&#x27;s successor in 1993 by the Grand Conference of National Reconciliation in Borama, which met for four months, leading to a gradual improvement in security, as well as a consolidation of the new territory. Another armed conflict between the Somaliland government, now under Egal, and rebels began, as militias of the Eidagalley clan occupied Hargeisa airport for some time. Conflict re-erupted when troops of the government attacked the airport to drive out the Eidagalley militias in October 1994, sparking a new war that would spread out of Hargeisa and last until around April 1995, with a rebel defeat. Around the same time, Djiboutian-backed forces of the Issa-dominated United Somali Front attempted and failed to carve out Issa-inhabited areas of Somaliland. Egal was reappointed in 1997, and remained in power until his death on 3 May 2002. The vice-president, Dahir Riyale Kahin, who was during the 1980s the highest-ranking National Security Service (NSS) officer in Berbera in Siad Barre&#x27;s government, was sworn in as president shortly afterward. In 2003, Kahin became the first elected president of Somaliland.

The war in southern Somalia between Islamist insurgents on the one hand, and the Federal Government of Somalia and its African Union allies on the other, has for the most part not directly affected Somaliland, which, like neighbouring Puntland, has remained relatively stable.

=== 2001 constitutional referendum ===

In August 2000, Egal&#x27;s government distributed thousands of copies of the proposed constitution throughout Somaliland for consideration and review by the people. One critical clause of the 130 individual articles of the constitution would ratify Somaliland&#x27;s self-declared independence and final separation from Somalia, restoring the nation&#x27;s independence for the first time since 1960. In late March 2001, Egal set the date for the referendum on the Constitution for 31 May 2001. 99.9% of eligible voters took part in the referendum and 97.1% of them voted in favour of the constitution.

=== 2023 Las Anod conflict ===
On 6 February 2023, the Dhulbahante clan elders of Las Anod declared their intent to secede from Somaliland and form a state government named &quot;SSC-Khatumo&quot; within the Federal Government of Somalia, triggering armed conflict.

During November 2024, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi &#x27;Irro&#x27; won the Somaliland presidential election.

== Government and politics ==


=== Constitution ===
The Constitution of Somaliland defines the political system; the Republic of Somaliland is a unitary state and Presidential Republic, based on peace, co-operation, democracy and a multi-party system.

=== President and cabinet ===
The executive is led by an elected president, whose government includes a vice-president and a Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers, who are responsible for the normal running of government, are nominated by the President and approved by the Parliament&#x27;s House of Representatives. The President must approve bills passed by the Parliament before they come into effect. Presidential elections are confirmed by the National Electoral Commission of Somaliland. The President can serve a maximum of two five-year terms. The official residence and administrative headquarters of the President is the Somaliland Presidential Palace or State House in the capital city of Hargeisa.

=== Parliament ===

Legislative power is held by the Parliament, which is bicameral. Its upper house is the House of Elders, chaired by Suleiman Mohamoud Adan, and the lower house is the House of Representatives, chaired by Yasin Haji Mohamoud. Each house has 82 members. Members of the House of Elders are elected indirectly by local communities for six-year terms. The House of Elders shares power in passing laws with the House of Representatives, and also has the role of solving internal conflicts, and exclusive power to extend the terms of the President and representatives under circumstances that make an election impossible. Members of the House of Representatives are directly elected by the people for five-year terms. The House of Representatives shares voting power with the House of Elders, though it can pass a law that the House of Elders rejects if it votes for the law by a two-thirds majority and has absolute power in financial matters and confirmation of Presidential appointments (except for the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court).

=== Law ===

The judicial system is divided into district courts (which deal with matters of family law and succession, lawsuits for amounts up to 3 million SLSH, criminal cases punishable by up to 3 years&#x27; imprisonment or 3 million SL fines, and crimes committed by juveniles), regional courts (which deal with lawsuits and criminal cases not within the jurisdiction of district courts, labour and employment claims, and local government elections), regional appeals courts (which deal with all appeals from the district and regional courts), and the Supreme court (which deals with issues between courts and in government, and reviews its own decisions), which is the highest court and also functions as the Constitutional Court.

Somaliland nationality law defines who is a Somaliland citizen, as well as the procedures by which one may be naturalised into Somaliland citizenship or renounce it.

The Somaliland government continues to apply the 1962 penal code of the Somali Republic. As such, homosexual acts are illegal in the territory.

=== Parties and elections ===

The &quot;guurti&quot; worked with rebel leaders to set up a new government, and was incorporated into the governance structure, becoming the Parliament&#x27;s House of Elders. The government became in essence a , with seats in the Upper and Lower houses proportionally allocated to clans according to a predetermined formula, although not all clans are satisfied with their representation. In 2002, after several extensions of this interim government, Somaliland transitioned to multi-party democracy. The election was limited to three parties, in an attempt to create ideology-based elections rather than clan-based elections. As of December 2014, Somaliland has three political parties: the Peace, Unity, and Development Party, the Justice and Development Party, and Wadani. Under the Somaliland Constitution, a maximum of three political parties at the national level is allowed. The minimum age required to vote is 15.

Freedom House ranks the Somaliland government as partly free. Seth Kaplan (2011) argues that in contrast to southern Somalia and adjacent territories, Somaliland, the secessionist northwestern portion of Somalia, has built a more democratic mode of governance from the bottom up, with virtually no foreign assistance. Specifically, Kaplan suggests that Somaliland has the most democratic political system in the Horn of Africa because it has been largely insulated from the extremist elements in the rest of Somalia and has viable electoral and legislative systems as well as a robust private sector-dominated economy, unlike neighbouring authoritarian governments. He largely attributes this to Somaliland&#x27;s integration of customary laws and tradition with modern state structures, which he indicates most post-colonial states in Africa and the Middle East have not had the opportunity to do. Kaplan asserts that this has facilitated cohesiveness and conferred greater governmental legitimacy in Somaliland, as has the territory&#x27;s comparatively homogeneous population, relatively equitable income distribution, a common fear of the south, and absence of interference by outside forces, which has obliged local politicians to observe a degree of accountability.

=== Foreign relations ===
Somaliland has political contacts with its neighbours Ethiopia and Djibouti, non-UN member state Republic of China (Taiwan), as well as with South Africa, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. On 17 January 2007, the European Union (EU) sent a delegation for foreign affairs to discuss future co-operation. The African Union (AU) has also sent a foreign minister to discuss the future of international acknowledgment, and on 29 and 30 January 2007, the ministers stated that they would discuss acknowledgement with the organisation&#x27;s member states.
In early 2006, the National Assembly for Wales extended an official invitation to the Somaliland government to attend the royal opening of the Senedd building in Cardiff. The move was seen as an act of recognition by the Welsh Assembly of the breakaway government&#x27;s legitimacy. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office made no comment on the invitation. Wales is home to a significant Somali expatriate community from Somaliland.

In 2007, a delegation led by President Kahin was present at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kampala, Uganda. Although Somaliland has applied to join the Commonwealth under observer status, its application is still pending.

On 24 September 2010, Johnnie Carson, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, stated that the United States would be modifying its strategy in Somalia and would seek deeper engagement with the governments of Somaliland and Puntland while continuing to support the Somali Transitional Government. Carson said the US would send aid workers and diplomats to Puntland and Somaliland and alluded to the possibility of future development projects. However, Carson emphasised that the US would not extend formal recognition to either region.
The then-UK Minister for Africa, Henry Bellingham MP, met President Silanyo of Somaliland in November 2010 to discuss ways in which to increase the UK&#x27;s engagement with Somaliland. President Silanyo said during his visit to London: 

Recognition of Somaliland by the UK was also supported by the UK Independence Party, which came third in the popular vote at the 2015 general election, though only electing a single MP. The leader of UKIP, Nigel Farage, met with Ali Aden Awale, Head of the Somaliland UK Mission on Somaliland&#x27;s national day, 18 May, in 2015, to express UKIP&#x27;s support for Somaliland.

In 2011, Somaliland and the neighbouring Puntland region each entered a security-related memorandum of understanding with the Seychelles. Following the framework of an earlier agreement signed between the Transitional Federal Government and Seychelles, the memorandum is 

On 1 July 2020, Somaliland and Taiwan signed an agreement to set up representative offices to promote cooperation between the two countries. Cooperation between the two polities on education, maritime security, and medicine began in 2009, and Taiwanese staff entered Somaliland in February 2020 to prepare for the representative office. As of 2023, Taiwan&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs refers to Somaliland as a country.

On 1 January 2024, a memorandum of understanding was signed between Ethiopia and Somaliland, where Ethiopia will lease the port of Berbera on the Gulf of Aden, and a 20-kilometre stretch of Gulf of Aden coastline, for 20 years, in exchange for eventual recognition of Somaliland as an independent state and a stake in the Ethiopian Airlines. If this agreement is honoured, Ethiopia would become the first United Nations member state to recognise the breakaway nation.

==== Border disputes ====

Somaliland continues to claim the entire area of the former British Somaliland which gained independence in 1960 in the name of State of Somaliland. It is currently in control of the vast majority of the former State of Somaliland.

Puntland, a federal member state of Somalia, disputes the Harti-inhabited territory in the former British Somaliland protectorate based on kinship. In 1998, the northern Darod clans established the state, and the Dhulbahante and Warsangali clans wholly participated in its foundation.

The Harti were the second most powerful clan confederation in Somaliland until the 1993 Borama Conference, when they were replaced in importance by the Gadabursi. The Dhulbahante and Warsangali clans established two separate administrations in the early 1990s. First, the former was to hold the Boocame I conference in May 1993, while the later held a conference in Hadaaftimo in September 1992. In both conferences the desire to remain part of Somalia was expressed.

Tensions between Puntland and Somaliland escalated into violence several times between 2002 and 2009. In October 2004, and again in April and October 2007, armed forces of Somaliland and Puntland clashed near the town of Las Anod, the capital of Sool region. In October 2007, Somaliland troops took control of the town. While celebrating Puntland&#x27;s 11th anniversary on 2 August 2009, Puntland officials vowed to recapture Las Anod. While Somaliland claims independent statehood and therefore &quot;split up&quot; the &quot;old&quot; Somalia, Puntland works for the re-establishment of a united but federal Somali state.

Somaliland forces took control of the town of Las Qorey in eastern Sanaag on 10 July 2008, along with positions east of the town. The defence forces completed their operations on 9 July 2008 after the Maakhir and Puntland militia in the area left their positions.

In the late 2000s, SSC Movement (Hoggaanka Badbaadada iyo Mideynta SSC), a local unionist group based in Sanaag was formed with the goal to establish its own regional administration (Sool, Sanaag and Cayn, or SSC). This later evolved into Khatumo State, which was established in 2012. The local administration and its constituents does not recognise the Somaliland government&#x27;s claim to sovereignty or to its territory.

On 20 October 2017 in Aynabo, an agreement was signed with the Somaliland government which stipulated the amendment of Somaliland&#x27;s constitution and to integrate the organisation into the Somaliland government. This signalled the end of the organisation even though it was an unpopular event among the Dhulbahante community.

=== Military ===
The Somaliland Armed Forces are the main military command in Somaliland. Along with the Somaliland Police and all other internal security forces, they are overseen by Somaliland&#x27;s Ministry of Defence. The current head of Somaliland&#x27;s Armed Forces is the Minister of Defence, Abdiqani Mohamoud Aateye. Following the declaration of independence, various pre-existing militia affiliated with different clans were absorbed into a centralised military structure. The resultant large military takes up around half of the country&#x27;s budget, but the action served to help prevent inter-clan violence.

The Somaliland Army consists of twelve divisions equipped primarily with light weaponry, though it is equipped with some howitzers and mobile rocket launchers. Its armoured vehicles and tanks are mostly of Soviet design, though there are some ageing Western vehicles and tanks in its arsenal. The Somaliland Navy (often referred to as a Coast Guard by the Associated Press), despite a crippling lack of equipment and formal training, has apparently had some success at curbing both piracy and illegal fishing within Somaliland waters.

=== Human rights ===
According to the 2023 Freedom House report, Somaliland has seen a consistent erosion of political rights and civic space. Public figures and journalists face pressure from authorities. Minority clans are subject to economic and political marginalisation, and violence against women remains a serious problem.

== Administrative divisions ==
The Republic of Somaliland is divided into six administrative regions: Awdal, Sahil, Maroodi Jeeh, Togdheer, Sanaag and Sool. The regions are divided into eighteen administrative districts.

=== Regions and districts ===
The following regions are taken from &quot;Michael Walls: State Formation in Somaliland: Bringing Deliberation to Institutionalism&quot; from 2011, &quot;Somaliland: The Strains of Success&quot; from 2015 and ActionAID, a humanitarian organisation currently active in Somaliland.

In 2019, the local government law passed in 2019 (Lr. 23/2019, hereinafter referred to as the 2019 local government law), regions that &quot;Somaliland is divided into six regions (Article 9 of the same law)&quot;. The 2019 Local Government Act came into force on 4 January 2020.

Under Article 11, Section 1 of the Act, the regional boundaries are supposed to correspond to the boundaries of the six districts under the Somaliland protectorate; however, the Siad Barre era boundaries subsist as the de facto boundaries.

== Geography ==
=== Location and habitat ===

Somaliland is situated in the northwest of recognised Somalia. It lies between 08°N and 11°30&#x27;N, and between 42°30&#x27;E and 49°00&#x27;E. It is bordered by Djibouti to the west, Ethiopia to the south, and Somalia to the east. Somaliland has an coastline with the majority lying along the Gulf of Aden. In terms of landmass, Somaliland has an area of .

Somaliland&#x27;s climate is a mixture of wet and dry conditions. The northern part of the region is hilly, and in many places the altitude ranges between above sea level. The Awdal, Sahil and Maroodi Jeex regions are fertile and mountainous, while Togdheer is mostly semi-desert with little fertile greenery around. The Awdal region is also known for its offshore islands, coral reefs and mangroves.

A scrub-covered, semi-desert plain referred as the &quot;Guban&quot; lies parallel to the Gulf of Aden littoral. With a width of in the west to as little as in the east, the plain is bisected by watercourses that are essentially beds of dry sand except during the rainy seasons. When the rains arrive, the Guban&#x27;s low bushes and grass clumps transform into lush vegetation. This coastal strip is part of the Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands ecoregion.

Cal Madow is a mountain range in the eastern part of the country. Extending from the northwest of Erigavo to several kilometres west of the city of Bosaso in neighbouring Somalia, it features Somaliland&#x27;s highest peak, Shimbiris, which sits at an elevation of about . The rugged east–west ranges of the Karkaar Mountains also lie to the interior of the Gulf of Aden littoral. In the central regions, the northern mountain ranges give way to shallow plateaus and typically dry watercourses that are referred to locally as the &quot;Ogo&quot;. The Ogo&#x27;s western plateau, in turn, gradually merges into the Haud, an important grazing area for livestock. In the east, the Haud is separated from the Ain and Nugal valleys by the Buur Dhaab mountain range.

=== Climate ===

Somaliland is located north of the equator. It is semi-arid. The average daily temperatures range from . The sun passes vertically overhead twice a year, in April and in August or September. Somaliland consists of three main topographic zones: a coastal plain (Guban), the coastal range (Ogo), and a plateau (Hawd). The coastal plain is a zone with high temperatures and low rainfall. Summer temperatures in the region easily average over . However, temperatures come down during the winter, and both human and livestock populations increase dramatically in the region.

The coastal range (Ogo) is a high plateau to the immediate south of Guban. Its elevation ranges from above sea level in the West to in the East. Rainfall is heavier there than in Guban, although it varies considerably within the zone. The plateau (Hawd) region lies to the south of Ogo range. It is generally more heavily populated during the wet season, when surface water is available. It is also an important area for grazing. Somalilanders recognise four seasons in the year; GU and Hagaa comprise spring and summer in that order, and Dayr and Jiilaal correspond to autumn and winter, respectively.

The average annual rainfall is in some parts of country according to availability of rain gauge, and most of it comes during Gu and Dayr. Gu, which is the first, or major, rainy season (late March, April, May, and early June), is where Ogo range and Hawd experience the heaviest rainfall. This constitutes the period of fresh grazing and abundant surface water. It is also the breeding season for livestock. Hagaa (from late June through August) is usually dry although there are often some scattered showers in the Ogo range, these are known as Karan rains. Hagaa tends to be hot and windy in most parts of the country. Dayr (September, October, and early November), which roughly corresponds to autumn, is the second, or minor, wet season; the amount of precipitation is generally less than that of Gu. Jilaal, or winter, falls in the coolest and driest months of the year (from late November to early March). It is a season of thirst. Hawd receive virtually no rainfall in winter. The rainfall in the Guban zone, known as &quot;Hays&quot;, comes from December to February. The humidity of the country varies from 63% in the dry season to 82% in the wet season.

=== Wildlife ===
== Economy ==

Somaliland has the fourth-lowest GDP per capita in the world, and there are huge socio-economic challenges for Somaliland, with an unemployment rate between 60 and 70% among youth, if not higher. According to ILO, illiteracy exists up to 70% in several areas of Somaliland, especially among females and the elder population.

Since Somaliland is unrecognised, international donors have found it difficult to provide aid. As a result, the government relies mainly upon tax receipts and remittances from the large Somali diaspora, which contribute significantly to the Somaliland economy. Remittances come to Somaliland through money transfer companies, the largest of which is Dahabshiil, one of the few Somali money transfer companies that conform to modern money-transfer regulations. The World Bank estimates that remittances worth approximately US$1 billion reach Somalia annually from émigrés working in the Gulf states, Europe and the United States. Analysts say that Dahabshiil may handle around two-thirds of that figure and as much as half of it reaches Somaliland alone.

Since the late 1990s, service provisions have significantly improved through limited government provisions and contributions from non-governmental organisations, religious groups, the international community (especially the diaspora), and the growing private sector. Local and municipal governments have been developing key public service provisions such as water in Hargeisa and education, electricity, and security in Berbera. In 2009, the Banque pour le Commerce et l&#x27;Industrie – Mer Rouge (BCIMR), based in Djibouti, opened a branch in Hargeisa and became the first bank in the country since the 1990 collapse of the Commercial and Savings Bank of Somalia. In 2014, Dahabshil Bank International became the country&#x27;s first commercial bank. In 2017 Premier Bank from Mogadishu opened a branch in Hargeisa.

=== Monetary and payment system ===

The Somaliland shilling, which cannot easily be exchanged outside of Somaliland on account of the nation&#x27;s lack of recognition, is regulated by the Bank of Somaliland, the central bank, which was established constitutionally in 1994.

The most popular and used payment system in the country is the ZAAD service, which is a mobile money transfer service that was launched in Somaliland in 2009 by the largest mobile operator Telesom.

=== Telecommunications ===
Telecommunications companies serving Somaliland include Telesom, Somtel, Telcom and NationLink.

The state-run Somaliland National TV is the main national public service television channel, and was launched in 2005. Its radio counterpart is Radio Hargeisa.

=== Agriculture ===

Livestock is the backbone of Somaliland&#x27;s economy. Sheep, camels, and cattle are shipped from the Berbera port and sent to Gulf Arab countries, such as Saudi Arabia. The country is home to some of the largest livestock markets, known in Somali as &quot;seylad&quot;, in the Horn of Africa, with as many as 10,000 heads of sheep and goats sold daily in the markets of Burao and Yirowe, many of whom shipped to Gulf states via the port of Berbera. The markets handle livestock from all over the Horn of Africa.

Agriculture is generally considered to be a potentially successful industry, especially in the production of cereals and horticulture. Mining also has potential, though simple quarrying represents the extent of current operations, despite the presence of diverse quantities of mineral deposits.

The primary method of agricultural production is rain-fed farming. Cereals are the primary crops cultivated. About 70% of the rain-fed agricultural land is used for the main crop, sorghum, while maize occupies another 25% of the land. Scattered marginal lands are also used to grow other crops like barley, millet, groundnuts, beans, and cowpeas. The majority of farms are located near riverbanks, along the banks of streams (&quot;togs&quot;) and other water sources. The primary methods of channelling water from the source to the farm are floods or crude earth canals that divert perennial water (springs) to the farm. Fruits and vegetables are grown for commercial use on the majority of irrigated farms. 

=== Tourism ===
The rock art and caves at Laas Geel, situated on the outskirts of Hargeisa, are a popular local tourist attraction. Totaling ten caves, they were discovered by a French archaeological team in 2002 and are believed to date back around 5,000 years. The government and locals keep the cave paintings safe and only a restricted number of tourists are allowed entry. Other notable sights include the Freedom Arch in Hargeisa and the War Memorial in the city centre. Natural attractions are very common around the region. The Naasa Hablood are twin hills located on the outskirts of Hargeisa that Somalis in the region consider to be a majestic natural landmark.

The Ministry of Tourism has also encouraged travellers to visit historic towns and cities in Somaliland. The historic town of Sheekh is located near Berbera and is home to old British colonial buildings that have remained untouched for over forty years. Berbera also houses historic and impressive Ottoman architectural buildings. Another equally famous historic city is Zeila. Zeila was once part of the Ottoman Empire, a dependency of Yemen and Egypt and a major trade city during the 19th century. The city has been visited for its old colonial landmarks, offshore mangroves and coral reefs, towering cliffs, and beach. The nomadic culture of Somaliland has also attracted tourists. Most nomads live in the countryside.

=== Transport ===
Bus services operate in Hargeisa, Burao, Gabiley, Berbera and Borama. There are also road transportation services between the major towns and adjacent villages, which are operated by different types of vehicles. Among these are taxis, four-wheel drives, minibuses and light goods vehicles (LGV).

The most prominent airlines serving Somaliland is Daallo Airlines, a Somali-owned private carrier with regular international flights that emerged after Somali Airlines ceased operations. African Express Airways and Ethiopian Airlines also fly from airports in Somaliland to Djibouti City, Addis Ababa, Dubai and Jeddah, and offer flights for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages via the Egal International Airport in Hargeisa. Other major airports in the region include the Berbera Airport.

=== Ports ===
In June 2016, the Somaliland government signed an agreement with DP World to manage the strategic port of Berbera with the aim of enhancing productive capacity and acting as an alternative port for landlocked Ethiopia.

=== Oil exploration ===
In 1958, the first test well was dug by Standard Vacuum (Exxon Mobil and Shell) in Dhagax Shabeel, Saaxil region. These wells were selected without field data or seismic testing and were solely based on the geological makeup of the region. Three of the four test wells were successful in producing of light crude oil.

In August 2012, the Somaliland government awarded Genel Energy a licence to explore oil within its territory. Results of a surface seep study completed early in 2015 confirmed the outstanding potential offered in the SL-10B, SL-13, and Oodweyne blocks, with estimated oil reserves of 1 billion barrels each. Genel Energy is set to drill an exploration well for SL-10B and SL-13 block in Buur-Dhaab, 20 kilometres northwest of Aynaba by the end of 2018. In December 2021, Genel Energy signed a farm-out deal with OPIC Somaliland Corporation, backed by Taiwan&#x27;s CPC Corporation, on the SL10B/13 block neary Aynaba. According to Genel, the block could contain more than 5 billion barrels of prospective resources. Drilling in SL-10B and SL-13 is scheduled to begin in late 2023, or early 2024 according to Genel.

== Demographics ==
There has not been an official census conducted in Somaliland since the Somalia census in 1975, while the results from a 1986 census were never released into public domain. A population estimate was conducted by UNFPA in 2014 primarily for the purpose of distributing United Nations funding among the regions and to offer a reliable population estimate in lieu of a census. This population estimate puts the combined population of the regions of Somaliland at 3.5 million. The Somaliland government estimates that there are 6,200,000 residents as of 2024, an increase from a 2021 government estimate of 5,700,000.

The last British population estimate on the basis of clan in Somaliland occurred before independence in 1960, according to which, out of some 650,000 ethnic Somalis belonging to three major clans residing in the protectorate, the Isaaq, Darod and Dir made up 66%, 19% and 16% of the population, respectively.


The largest clan family in Somaliland is the Isaaq, currently making up 80% of Somaliland&#x27;s population. The populations of the five largest cities in Somaliland – Hargeisa, Burao, Berbera, Erigavo and Gabiley – are predominantly Isaaq. The second largest clan is the Gadabursi of the Dir clan followed by the Harti of the Darod. Other small clans are often not accounted for in such estimates, however, clans including Gabooye, Gahayle, Jibrahil, Magaadle, Fiqishini, and Akisho settle in Somaliland.

Somaliland in addition has an estimated 600,000 to a million strong diaspora, mainly residing in Western Europe, the Middle East, North America, and several other African countries.

=== Clan groups ===

The Gadabursi subclan of the Dir are the predominant clan of the Awdal region, where there is also a sizeable minority of the Issa subclan of the Dir who mainly inhabit the Zeila District.

The Habr Awal subclan of the Isaaq form the majority of the population living in both the northern and western portions of the Maroodi Jeex region, including the cities and towns of northern Hargeisa, Berbera, Gabiley, Madheera, Wajaale, Arabsiyo, Bulhar and Kalabaydh. The Habr Awal also have a strong presence in the Saaxil region as well, principally around the city of Berbera and the town of Sheikh.

The Arap subclan of the Isaaq predominantly live in the southern portion of the Maroodi Jeex region including the capital city of Hargeisa. Additionally, they form the majority of communities living in the Hawd region including Baligubadle. The Arap are also well represented in Sahil and Togdheer regions.

The Garhajis subclan of the Isaaq have a sizeable presence among the population inhabiting the southern and eastern portions of Maroodi Jeex region including Southern Hargeisa and Salahlay. The Garhajis are also represented well in western Togdheer region, mainly in Oodweyne and Burao, as well as Sheekh and Berbera in Sahil region. The Garhajis also have a significant presence in the western and central areas of Sanaag region as well, including the regional capital Erigavo as well as Maydh.

The Habr Je&#x27;lo subclan of the Isaaq have a large presence in the western parts of Sool, eastern Togdheer region and western Sanaag as well, The Habr Je&#x27;lo form a majority of the population living in Burao as well as in the Togdheer region, western Sanaag, including the towns of Garadag, Xiis and Ceel Afweyn and the Aynabo District in Sool. The clan also has a significant presence in the Sahil region, particularly in the towns of Karin and El-Darad, and also inhabit the regional capital Berbera.
Eastern Sool region residents mainly hail from the Dhulbahante, a subdivision of the Harti confederation of Darod sub-clans, and are concentrated at majority of Sool region districts. The Dhulbahante clans also settle in the Buuhoodle District in the Togdheer region, and the southern and eastern parts of Erigavo District in Sanaag.

The Warsangali, another Harti Darod sub-clan, live in the eastern parts of Sanaag, with their population being mainly concentrated in Las Qorey district.

=== Languages ===

Many people in Somaliland speak at least two of the three national languages: Somali, Arabic and English, although the rate of bilingualism is lower in rural areas. Article 6 of the Constitution of 2001 designates the official language of Somaliland to be Somali, though Arabic is a mandatory subject in school and is used in mosques around the region and English is spoken and taught in schools.

The Somali language is the mother tongue of the Somali people, the nation&#x27;s most populous ethnic group. It is a member of the Cushitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family, and its nearest relatives are the Oromo, Afar and Saho languages. Somali is the best documented of the Cushitic languages, with academic studies of it dating from before 1900.

Northern Somali is the main dialect spoken in the country, in contrast to Benadiri Somali which is the main dialect spoken in Somalia.

=== Religion ===
With few exceptions, Somalis in Somaliland and elsewhere are Muslims, the majority belonging to the Sunni branch of Islam and the Shafi&#x27;i school of Islamic jurisprudence. As with southern Somali coastal towns such as Mogadishu and Merca, there is also a presence of Sufism, Islamic mysticism; particularly the Arab Rifa&#x27;iya tariiqa. Through the influence of the diaspora from Yemen and the Gulf states, stricter Wahhabism also has a noticeable presence. Though traces of pre-Islamic traditional religion exist in Somaliland, Islam is dominant to the Somali sense of national identity. Many of the Somali social norms come from their religion. For example, most Somali women wear a hijab when they are in public. In addition, religious Somalis abstain from pork and alcohol, and also try to avoid receiving or paying any form of interest (usury). Muslims generally congregate on Friday afternoons for a sermon and group prayer.

Under the Constitution of Somaliland, Islam is the state religion, and no laws may violate the principles of Sharia. The promotion of any religion other than Islam is illegal, and the state promotes Islamic tenets and discourages behaviour contrary to .

Somaliland has very few Christians. In 1913, during the early part of the colonial era, there were virtually no Christians in the Somali territories, with about 100–200 followers coming from the schools and orphanages of the handful of Catholic missions in the British Somaliland protectorate. The small number of Christians in the region today mostly come from similar Catholic institutions in Aden, Djibouti, and Berbera.

Somaliland falls within the Episcopal Area of the Horn of Africa as part of Somalia, under the Anglican Diocese of Egypt. However, there are no current congregations in the territory. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Mogadiscio is designated to serve the area as part of Somalia. However, since 1990 there has been no Bishop of Mogadishu, and the Bishop of Djibouti acts as Apostolic Administrator. The Adventist Mission also indicates that there are no Adventist members.

=== Health ===
While 40.5% of households in Somaliland have access to improved water sources, almost a third of households lie at least an hour away from their primary source of drinking water. 1 in 11 children die before their first birthday, and 1 in 9 die before their fifth birthday.

The UNICEF multiple indicator cluster survey (MICS) in 2006 found that 94.8% of women in Somaliland had undergone some form of female genital mutilation; in 2018 the Somaliland government issued a fatwa condemning the two most severe forms of FGM, but no laws are present to punish those responsible for the practice.

=== Education ===
Somaliland has an urban literacy rate of 59% and a rural literacy rate of 47%, according to a 2015 World Bank assessment.

== Culture ==

The main clans of Somaliland: Isaaq (Garhajis, Habr Je&#x27;lo, Habr Awal, Arap, Ayub), Harti (Dhulbahante, Warsangali, Kaskiqabe, Gahayle), Dir (Gadabuursi, Issa, Magaadle) and Madhiban. Other smaller clans include: Jibraahil, Akisho, and others.

The clan groupings of the Somali people are important social units, and have a central role in Somali culture and politics. Clans are patrilineal and are often divided into sub-clans, sometimes with many sub-divisions.

Somali society is traditionally ethnically endogamous. To extend ties of alliance, marriage is often to another ethnic Somali from a different clan. Thus, for example, a 1954 study observed that in 89 marriages contracted by men of the Dhulbahante clan, 55 (62%) were with women of Dhulbahante sub-clans other than those of their husbands; 30 (33.7%) were with women of surrounding clans of other clan families (Isaaq, 28; Hawiye, 3); and 3 (4.3%) were with women of other clans of the Darod clan family (Majerteen 2, Ogaden 1).

=== Arts ===

Islam and poetry have been described as the twin pillars of Somali culture. Somali poetry is mainly oral, with both male and female poets. They use things that are common in the Somali language as metaphors. Almost all Somalis are Sunni Muslims and Islam is vitally important to the Somali sense of national identity. Most Somalis do not belong to a specific mosque or sect and can pray in any mosque they find.

Celebrations come in the form of religious festivities. Two of the most important are Eid ul-Adha and Eid ul-Fitr, which marks the end of the fasting month. Families get dressed up to visit one another, and money is donated to the poor. Other holidays include 26 June and 18 May, which celebrate British Somaliland&#x27;s independence and the Somaliland region&#x27;s establishment, respectively; the latter, however, is not recognised by the international community.
In the nomadic culture, where one&#x27;s possessions are frequently moved, there is little reason for the plastic arts to be highly developed. Somalis embellish and decorate their woven and wooden milk jugs (&quot;haamo&quot;; the most decorative jugs are made in Ceerigaabo) as well as wooden headrests. Traditional dance is also important, though mainly as a form of courtship among young people. One such dance known as &quot;Ciyaar Soomaali&quot; is a local favourite.

An important form of art in Somali culture is henna art. The custom of applying henna dates back to antiquity. During special occasions, a Somali woman&#x27;s hands and feet are expected to be covered in decorative mendhi. Girls and women usually apply or decorate their hands and feet in henna on festive celebrations like Eid or weddings. The henna designs vary from very simple to highly intricate. Somali designs vary, with some more modern and simple while others are traditional and intricate. Traditionally, only women apply it as body art, as it is considered a feminine custom. Henna is not only applied on the hands and feet but is also used as a dye. Somali men and women alike use henna as a dye to change their hair colour. Women are free to apply henna on their hair as most of the time they are wearing a hijab.

=== Sport ===
Popular sports in Somaliland include football, track, field, and basketball. Somaliland has a national football team, though it is not a member of FIFA or the Confederation of African Football.

<text>Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument (among various similar names) is a mathematical proof that there are infinite sets which cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the infinite set of natural numbersinformally, that there are sets which in some sense contain more elements than there are positive integers. Such sets are now called uncountable sets, and the size of infinite sets is treated by the theory of cardinal numbers, which Cantor began.

Georg Cantor published this proof in 1891, but it was not his first proof of the uncountability of the real numbers, which appeared in 1874.
However, it demonstrates a general technique that has since been used in a wide range of proofs, including the first of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems and Turing&#x27;s answer to the &quot;Entscheidungsproblem&quot;. Diagonalization arguments are often also the source of contradictions like Russell&#x27;s paradox and Richard&#x27;s paradox.

== Uncountable set ==
Cantor considered the set &quot;T&quot; of all infinite sequences of binary digits (i.e. each digit is zero or one).
He begins with a constructive proof of the following lemma:
:If &quot;s&quot;1, &quot;s&quot;2, ... , &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;, ... is any enumeration of elements from &quot;T&quot;, then an element &quot;s&quot; of &quot;T&quot; can be constructed that doesn&#x27;t correspond to any &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot; in the enumeration.
The proof starts with an enumeration of elements from &quot;T&quot;, for example
Next, a sequence &quot;s&quot; is constructed by choosing the 1st digit as complementary to the 1st digit of &quot;s&quot;&quot;1&quot; (swapping 0s for 1s and vice versa), the 2nd digit as complementary to the 2nd digit of &quot;s&quot;&quot;2&quot;, the 3rd digit as complementary to the 3rd digit of &quot;s&quot;&quot;3&quot;, and generally for every &quot;n&quot;, the &quot;n&quot;th digit as complementary to the &quot;n&quot;th digit of &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;. For the example above, this yields
By construction, &quot;s&quot; is a member of &quot;T&quot; that differs from each &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;, since their &quot;n&quot;th digits differ (highlighted in the example).
Hence, &quot;s&quot; cannot occur in the enumeration.

Based on this lemma, Cantor then uses a proof by contradiction to show that:
:The set &quot;T&quot; is uncountable.
The proof starts by assuming that &quot;T&quot; is countable.
Then all its elements can be written in an enumeration &quot;s&quot;1, &quot;s&quot;2, ... , &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;, ... .
Applying the previous lemma to this enumeration produces a sequence &quot;s&quot; that is a member of &quot;T&quot;, but is not in the enumeration. However, if &quot;T&quot; is enumerated, then every member of &quot;T&quot;, including this &quot;s&quot;, is in the enumeration. This contradiction implies that the original assumption is false. Therefore, &quot;T&quot; is uncountable.

=== Real numbers ===
The uncountability of the real numbers was already established by Cantor&#x27;s first uncountability proof, but it also follows from the above result. To prove this, an injection will be constructed from the set &quot;T&quot; of infinite binary strings to the set R of real numbers. Since &quot;T&quot; is uncountable, the image of this function, which is a subset of R, is uncountable. Therefore, R is uncountable. Also, by using a method of construction devised by Cantor, a bijection will be constructed between &quot;T&quot; and R. Therefore, &quot;T&quot; and R have the same cardinality, which is called the &quot;cardinality of the continuum&quot; and is usually denoted by formula_1 or formula_2.

An injection from &quot;T&quot; to R is given by mapping binary strings in &quot;T&quot; to decimal fractions, such as mapping &quot;t&quot; = 0111... to the decimal 0.0111... This function, defined by , is an injection because it maps different strings to different numbers.

Constructing a bijection between &quot;T&quot; and R is slightly more complicated.
Instead of mapping 0111... to the decimal 0.0111..., it can be mapped to the base &quot;b&quot; number: 0.0111...&quot;b&quot;. This leads to the family of functions: . The functions are injections, except for . This function will be modified to produce a bijection between &quot;T&quot; and R.

===General sets===

A generalized form of the diagonal argument was used by Cantor to prove Cantor&#x27;s theorem: for every set &quot;S&quot;, the power set of &quot;S&quot;—that is, the set of all subsets of &quot;S&quot; (here written as P(&quot;S&quot;))—cannot be in bijection with &quot;S&quot; itself. This proof proceeds as follows:

Let &quot;f&quot; be any function from &quot;S&quot; to P(&quot;S&quot;). It suffices to prove &quot;f&quot; cannot be surjective. That means that some member &quot;T&quot; of P(&quot;S&quot;), i.e. some subset of &quot;S&quot;, is not in the image of &quot;f&quot;. As a candidate consider the set:

:formula_3.

For every &quot;s&quot; in &quot;S&quot;, either &quot;s&quot; is in &quot;T&quot; or not. If &quot;s&quot; is in &quot;T&quot;, then by definition of &quot;T&quot;, &quot;s&quot; is not in &quot;f&quot;(&quot;s&quot;), so &quot;T&quot; is not equal to &quot;f&quot;(&quot;s&quot;). On the other hand, if &quot;s&quot; is not in &quot;T&quot;, then by definition of &quot;T&quot;, &quot;s&quot; is in &quot;f&quot;(&quot;s&quot;), so again &quot;T&quot; is not equal to &quot;f&quot;(&quot;s&quot;); cf. picture.
For a more complete account of this proof, see Cantor&#x27;s theorem.

==Consequences==
===Ordering of cardinals===
With equality defined as the existence of a bijection between their underlying sets, Cantor also defines binary predicate of cardinalities formula_4 and formula_5 in terms of the existence of injections between formula_6 and formula_7. It has the properties of a preorder and is here written &quot;formula_8&quot;. One can embed the naturals into the binary sequences, thus proving various &quot;injection existence&quot; statements explicitly, so that in this sense formula_9, where formula_10 denotes the function space formula_11. But following from the argument in the previous sections, there is &quot;no surjection&quot; and so also no bijection, i.e. the set is uncountable. For this one may write formula_12, where &quot;formula_13&quot; is understood to mean the existence of an injection together with the proven absence of a bijection (as opposed to alternatives such as the negation of Cantor&#x27;s preorder, or a definition in terms of assigned ordinals). Also formula_14 in this sense, as has been shown, and at the same time it is the case that formula_15, for all sets formula_6.

Assuming the law of excluded middle, characteristic functions surject onto powersets, and then formula_17. So the uncountable formula_10 is also not enumerable and it can also be mapped onto formula_19. Classically, the Schröder–Bernstein theorem is valid and says that any two sets which are in the injective image of one another are in bijection as well. Here, every unbounded subset of formula_19 is then in bijection with formula_19 itself, and every subcountable set (a property in terms of surjections) is then already countable, i.e. in the surjective image of formula_19. In this context the possibilities are then exhausted, making &quot;formula_8&quot; a non-strict partial order, or even a total order when assuming choice. The diagonal argument thus establishes that, although both sets under consideration are infinite, there are actually &quot;more&quot; infinite sequences of ones and zeros than there are natural numbers.
Cantor&#x27;s result then also implies that the notion of the set of all sets is inconsistent: If formula_6 were the set of all sets, then formula_25 would at the same time be bigger than formula_6 and a subset of formula_6.

====In the absence of excluded middle====
Also in constructive mathematics, there is no surjection from the full domain formula_19 onto the space of functions formula_29 or onto the collection of subsets formula_30, which is to say these two collections are uncountable. Again using &quot;formula_13&quot; for proven injection existence in conjunction with bijection absence, one has formula_32 and formula_33. Further, formula_34, as previously noted. Likewise, formula_35, formula_36 and of course formula_37, also in constructive set theory.

It is however harder or impossible to order ordinals and also cardinals, constructively. For example, the Schröder–Bernstein theorem requires the law of excluded middle. In fact, the standard ordering on the reals, extending the ordering of the rational numbers, is not necessarily decidable either. Neither are most properties of interesting classes of functions decidable, by Rice&#x27;s theorem, i.e. the set of counting numbers for the subcountable sets may not be recursive and can thus fail to be countable. The elaborate collection of subsets of a set is constructively not exchangeable with the collection of its characteristic functions. In an otherwise constructive context (in which the law of excluded middle is not taken as axiom), it is consistent to adopt non-classical axioms that contradict consequences of the law of excluded middle. Uncountable sets such as formula_10 or formula_29 may be asserted to be subcountable.
This is a notion of size that is redundant in the classical context, but otherwise need not imply countability. The existence of injections from the uncountable formula_10 or formula_29 into formula_19 is here possible as well. So the cardinal relation fails to be antisymmetric. Consequently, also in the presence of function space sets that are even classically uncountable, intuitionists do not accept this relation to constitute a hierarchy of transfinite sizes.
When the axiom of powerset is not adopted, in a constructive framework even the subcountability of all sets is then consistent. That all said, in common set theories, the non-existence of a set of all sets also already follows from Predicative Separation.

In a set theory, theories of mathematics are modeled. Weaker logical axioms mean fewer constraints and so allow for a richer class of models. A set may be identified as a model of the field of real numbers when it fulfills some axioms of real numbers or a constructive rephrasing thereof. Various models have been studied, such as the Cauchy reals or the Dedekind reals, among others. The former relate to quotients of sequences while the later are well-behaved cuts taken from a powerset, if they exist. In the presence of excluded middle, those are all isomorphic and uncountable. Otherwise, variants of the Dedekind reals can be countable or inject into the naturals, but not jointly. When assuming countable choice, constructive Cauchy reals even without an explicit modulus of convergence are then Cauchy-complete and Dedekind reals simplify so as to become isomorphic to them. Indeed, here choice also aids diagonal constructions and when assuming it, Cauchy-complete models of the reals are uncountable.

===Open questions===
Motivated by the insight that the set of real numbers is &quot;bigger&quot; than the set of natural numbers, one is led to ask if there is a set whose cardinality is &quot;between&quot; that of the integers and that of the reals. This question leads to the famous continuum hypothesis. Similarly, the question of whether there exists a set whose cardinality is between |&quot;S&quot;| and |P(&quot;S&quot;)| for some infinite &quot;S&quot; leads to the generalized continuum hypothesis.

===Diagonalization in broader context===
Russell&#x27;s paradox has shown that set theory that includes an unrestricted comprehension scheme is contradictory. Note that there is a similarity between the construction of &quot;T&quot; and the set in Russell&#x27;s paradox. Therefore, depending on how we modify the axiom scheme of comprehension in order to avoid Russell&#x27;s paradox, arguments such as the non-existence of a set of all sets may or may not remain valid.

Analogues of the diagonal argument are widely used in mathematics to prove the existence or nonexistence of certain objects. For example, the conventional proof of the unsolvability of the halting problem is essentially a diagonal argument. Also, diagonalization was originally used to show the existence of arbitrarily hard complexity classes and played a key role in early attempts to prove P does not equal NP.

==Version for Quine&#x27;s New Foundations==
The above proof fails for W. V. Quine&#x27;s &quot;New Foundations&quot; set theory (NF). In NF, the naive axiom scheme of comprehension is modified to avoid the paradoxes by introducing a kind of &quot;local&quot; type theory. In this axiom scheme,

:{ &quot;s&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot;: &quot;s&quot; ∉ &quot;f&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) }

is &quot;not&quot; a set — i.e., does not satisfy the axiom scheme. On the other hand, we might try to create a modified diagonal argument by noticing that

:{ &quot;s&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot;: &quot;s&quot; ∉ &quot;f&quot;({&quot;s&quot;}) }

&quot;is&quot; a set in NF. In which case, if P1(&quot;S&quot;) is the set of one-element subsets of &quot;S&quot; and &quot;f&quot; is a proposed bijection from P1(&quot;S&quot;) to P(&quot;S&quot;), one is able to use proof by contradiction to prove that |P1(&quot;S&quot;)| &lt; |P(&quot;S&quot;)|.

The proof follows by the fact that if &quot;f&quot; were indeed a map &quot;onto&quot; P(&quot;S&quot;), then we could find &quot;r&quot; in &quot;S&quot;, such that &quot;f&quot;({&quot;r&quot;}) coincides with the modified diagonal set, above. We would conclude that if &quot;r&quot; is not in &quot;f&quot;({&quot;r&quot;}), then &quot;r&quot; is in &quot;f&quot;({&quot;r&quot;}) and vice versa.

It is &quot;not&quot; possible to put P1(&quot;S&quot;) in a one-to-one relation with &quot;S&quot;, as the two have different types, and so any function so defined would violate the typing rules for the comprehension scheme.

<text>British Somaliland, officially the Somaliland Protectorate (), was a protectorate of the United Kingdom in modern Somaliland. During its existence, the territory was bordered by Italian Somalia, French Somali Coast and Abyssinia (temporarily Italian Ethiopia). From 1940 to 1941, it was occupied by the Italians and was part of Italian East Africa.

On 26 June 1960, British Somaliland was formally granted independence by the United Kingdom as the State of Somaliland. Five days later, on 1 July 1960, the State of Somaliland voluntarily united with the Trust Territory of Somalia (the former Italian Somalia) to form the Somali Republic. The government of Somaliland, an unrecognised independent state that is internationally recognised as an autonomous region of Somalia, regards itself as the successor state to British Somaliland.

==History==
===Treaties and establishment===

In the late 19th century, the United Kingdom signed agreements with the Gadabuursi, Issa, Habr Awal, Garhajis, Arap ,Habr Je&#x27;lo and Warsangeli clans establishing a protectorate. Many of these clans had signed the protection treaties with the British in response to Ethiopian Emperor Menelik&#x27;s Invasions. The agreements dictated the protection of Somali rights and the maintenance of independence. The British garrisoned the protectorate from Aden and administered it from their British India colony until 1898. British Somaliland was then administered by the Foreign Office until 1905 and afterwards by the Colonial Office.

Generally, the British did not have much interest in the resource-barren region. The stated purposes of the establishment of the protectorate were to &quot;secure a supply market, check the traffic in slaves, and to exclude the interference of foreign powers.&quot; The British principally viewed the protectorate as a source for supplies of meat for their British Indian outpost in Aden through the maintenance of order in the coastal areas and protection of the caravan routes from the interior. Hence, the region&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Aden&#x27;s butcher&#x27;s shop&quot;. Colonial administration during this period did not extend administrative infrastructure beyond the coast, and contrasted with the more interventionist colonial experience of Italian Somalia.

===Dervish uprising===


Beginning in 1899, the British were forced to expend considerable human and military capital to contain a decades-long resistance mounted by the Dervish movement. The movement was led by Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, a Somali religious leader referred to colloquially by the British as the &quot;Mad Mullah&quot;. Repeated military expeditions were unsuccessfully launched against Hassan and his Dervishes before World War I.
On 9 August 1913, the Somaliland Camel Constabulary suffered a serious defeat at the Battle of Dul Madoba at the hands of the Dervishes. Hassan had already evaded several attempts to capture him. At Dul Madoba, his forces killed or wounded 57 members of the 110-man Constabulary unit, including the British commander, Colonel Richard Corfield.

In 1914, the British created the Somaliland Camel Corps to assist in maintaining order in British Somaliland.

In 1920, the British launched their fifth and final expedition against Hassan and his followers. Employing the then-new technology of military aircraft, the British finally managed to quell Hassan&#x27;s twenty-year-long struggle. The British tricked Hassan into preparing for an official visit, then launched bombing raids in the city of Taleh where most of his troops were stationed, causing the mullah to retreat into the desert. Hassan and his Dervish supporters fled to the Ogaden, where Hassan died in 1921.

===Somaliland Camel Corps===


The Somaliland Camel Corps, also referred to as the Somali Camel Corps, was a unit of the British Army based in British Somaliland. It lasted from the early 20th century until 1944. The troopers of the Somaliland Camel Corps had a distinctive dress. It was based on the standard British Army khaki drill but included a knitted woollen pullover and drill patches on the shoulders. Shorts were worn with woollen socks on puttees and &quot;chaplis&quot;, boots or bare feet. Equipment consisted of leather ammunition bandolier and a leather waist belt. The officers wore pith helmets and khaki drill uniforms. Other ranks wore a &quot;kullah&quot; with &quot;puggree&quot; which ended in a long tail which hung down the back. A &quot;chaplis&quot; is typically a colourful sandal. A &quot;kullah&quot; is a type of cap. A &quot;puggree&quot; is typically a strip of cloth wound around the upper portion of a hat or helmet, particularly a pith helmet, and falling down from behind to act as a shade for the back of the neck.

===British Somaliland 1920–1930===

Following the defeat of the Dervish resistance, the two fundamental goals of British policy in British Somaliland were the preservation of stability and the economic self-sufficiency of the protectorate. The second goal remained particularly elusive because of local resistance to taxation that might have been used to support the protectorate&#x27;s administration. By the 1930s, the British presence had extended to other parts of British Somaliland. Growth in commercial trade motivated some livestock herders to subsequently leave the pastoral economy and settle in urban areas. Customs taxes also helped pay for British India&#x27;s patrol of Somalia&#x27;s Red Sea Coast.

Among military units in British Somaliland during the interwar period was a battalion of the Indian Army 4th Bombay Grenadiers.

===Italian invasion===

In August 1940, during the East African campaign in World War II, British Somaliland was invaded by Italy. The few British forces that were present attempted to defend the main road to Berbera, but were dislodged from their positions and retreated after losing the Battle of Tug Argan. During this period, the British rounded up soldiers and governmental officials to evacuate them from the territory through Berbera. In total, 7,000 people, including civilians, were evacuated. The Somalis serving in the Somaliland Camel Corps were given the choice of evacuation or disbandment; the majority chose to remain and were allowed to retain their arms.

In March 1941, after a six-month Italian occupation, British forces recaptured the protectorate during Operation Appearance. The final remnants of the Italian guerrilla movement discontinued all resistance in British Somaliland by the autumn of 1943.

===1945 Sheikh Bashir rebellion===
The 1945 Sheikh Bashir Rebellion was an uprising by tribesmen of the Habr Je&#x27;lo clan in the cities of Burao and Erigavo in the former British Somaliland protectorate against British authorities in July 1945 led by Sheikh Bashir, a Somali religious leader belonging to the Yeesif sub-division.

On 2 July, Sheikh Hamza collected 25 of his followers in the town of Wadamago and transported them on a lorry to the vicinity of Burao, where he distributed arms to half of his followers. On the evening of 3 July the group entered Burao and opened fire on the police guard of the central prison in the city, which was filled with prisoners arrested for previous demonstrations. The group also attacked the house of the district commissioner of Burao District, Major Chambers, resulting in the death of Major Chamber&#x27;s police guard before escaping to Bur Dhab, a strategic mountain south-east of Burao, where Sheikh Bashir&#x27;s small unit occupied a fort and took up a defensive position in anticipation of a British counterattack.

The British campaign against Sheikh Hamza troops proved abortive after several defeats as his forces kept on the move. No sooner had the expedition left the area, than the news travelled fast among the Somali nomads across the plain. The war had exposed the British administration to humiliation. The government came to a conclusion that another expedition against him would be useless; that they must build a railway, make roads and effectively occupy the whole of the protectorate, or else abandon the interior. The latter course was decided upon and during the first months of 1945, the advance posts were withdrawn and the British administration confined to the coast town of Berbera.

Sheikh Bashir settled many disputes among the tribes in the vicinity, which kept them from raiding each other. He was generally thought to settle disputes through the use of Islamic Sharia and gathered around him a strong following.

Sheikh Bashir sent a message to religious figures in the town of Erigavo and called on them to revolt and join the rebellion he led. The religious leaders as well as the people of Erigavo heeded his call, and mobilized a substantial number of people armed with rifles and spears and staged a revolt. The British authorities responded rapidly and severely, sending reinforcements to the town and opening fire on the armed mobs in two &quot;local actions&quot; as well as arresting minor religious leaders in the town.

The British administration recruited Indian and South African troops, led by police general James David, to fight against Sheikh Bashir and had intelligence plans to capture him alive. The British authorities mobilized a police force, and eventually on 7 July found Sheikh Bashir and his unit in defensive positions behind their fortifications in the mountains of Bur Dhab. After clashes Sheikh Bashir and his second-in-command, Alin Yusuf Ali, nicknamed Qaybdiid, were killed. A third rebel was wounded and was captured along with two other rebels. The rest fled the fortifications and dispersed. On the British side the police general leading the British troops as well as a number of Indian and South African troops perished in the clashes, and a policeman was injured.

Despite the death of Sheikh Hamza and his followers resistance against British authorities continued in Somaliland, especially in Erigavo where his death stirred further resistance in the town and the town of Badhan and lead to attacks on British colonial troops throughout the district and the seizing of arms from the rural constabulary.

The British authorities was not finished with the rebels even after most of them had died and continued its counter-insurgency campaign. The authorities had quickly learned the names and identities of all the followers of Sheikh Bashir and tried to convince the locals to turn them in. When they refused, the authorities invoked the &quot;Collective Punishment Ordinance&quot;, under which the authorities seized and impounded a total of 6,000 camels owned by the Habr Je&#x27;lo, the clan that Sheikh Bashir belonged to. The British authorities made the return of the livestock dependent on the turning over and arrest of the escaped rebels. The remaining rebels were subsequently found and arrested, and transported to the Saad-ud-Din archipelago, off the coast of Zeila in northwestern Somaliland.

===Independence and union with the Trust Territory of Somaliland===

In 1947, the entire budget for the administration of the British Somaliland protectorate was only £213,139.

In May 1960, the British Government stated that it would be prepared to grant independence to the then Somaliland protectorate. The Legislative Council of British Somaliland passed a resolution in April 1960 requesting independence. The legislative councils of the territory agreed to this proposal.

In April 1960, leaders of the two territories met in Mogadishu and agreed to form a unitary state. An elected president was to be head of state. Full executive powers would be held by a prime minister answerable to an elected National Assembly of 123 members representing the two territories.

On 26 June 1960, the British Somaliland protectorate gained independence as the State of Somaliland. Five days later on 1 July 1960 Somaliland officially merged with the Trust Territory of Somaliland to create the Somali Republic.

On 1 July 1960 the legislature elected Haji Bashir, the old speaker of the Somaliland Assembly, as the first President of the new Republic of Somalia National Assembly, and also on that same day Aden Adde was elected as the President of the newly formed Somali Republic.

== Politics ==

Until 1898, Somaliland was administered by the British resident at Aden as a dependency of the Government of India. From 1898 it was under the purview of the Foreign Office, and from 1905 onward (with the exception of a period of military administration until 1948 following the Italian invasion) it was administered by the Colonial Office.

Until 1957, executive and legislative power were solely vested in the Governor, although he had a non-statutory council to advise him. In 1947, a Protectorate Advisory Council was established on a tribal basis, with representatives of other communities and official members as well. In 1957, a Legislative Council and an Executive Council were created. From 1959, there were elections to the Legislative Council. A new constitution was introduced in 1960, shortly before independence.

==Republic of Somaliland==
In 1991, after a bloody civil war for independence in the northern part of the Somali Democratic Republic, the area which formerly encompassed British Somaliland declared independence. In May 1991, the formation of the &quot;Republic of Somaliland&quot; was proclaimed, with the local government regarding it as the successor to the former British Somaliland as well as to the State of Somaliland. However, Somaliland’s independence remains unrecognised by any United Nations member state.

<text>In mathematics, hyperreal numbers are an extension of the real numbers to include certain classes of infinite and infinitesimal numbers. A hyperreal number formula_1 is said to be finite if, and only if, formula_2 for some integer formula_3. formula_1 is said to be infinitesimal if, and only if, formula_5 for all positive integers formula_3. The term &quot;hyper-real&quot; was introduced by Edwin Hewitt in 1948.

The hyperreal numbers satisfy the transfer principle, a rigorous version of Leibniz&#x27;s heuristic law of continuity. The transfer principle states that true first-order statements about R are also valid in *R. For example, the commutative law of addition, , holds for the hyperreals just as it does for the reals; since R is a real closed field, so is *R. Since formula_7 for all integers &quot;n&quot;, one also has formula_8 for all hyperintegers formula_9. The transfer principle for ultrapowers is a consequence of Łoś&#x27;s theorem of 1955.

Concerns about the soundness of arguments involving infinitesimals date back to ancient Greek mathematics, with Archimedes replacing such proofs with ones using other techniques such as the method of exhaustion. In the 1960s, Abraham Robinson proved that the hyperreals were logically consistent if and only if the reals were. This put to rest the fear that any proof involving infinitesimals might be unsound, provided that they were manipulated according to the logical rules that Robinson delineated.

The application of hyperreal numbers and in particular the transfer principle to problems of analysis is called nonstandard analysis. One immediate application is the definition of the basic concepts of analysis such as the derivative and integral in a direct fashion, without passing via logical complications of multiple quantifiers. Thus, the derivative of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) becomes formula_10 for an infinitesimal formula_11, where st(⋅) denotes the standard part function, which &quot;rounds off&quot; each finite hyperreal to the nearest real. Similarly, the integral is defined as the standard part of a suitable infinite sum.

== Transfer principle ==

The idea of the hyperreal system is to extend the real numbers R to form a system *R that includes infinitesimal and infinite numbers, but without changing any of the elementary axioms of algebra. Any statement of the form &quot;for any number x ...&quot; that is true for the reals is also true for the hyperreals. For example, the axiom that states &quot;for any number &quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot; + 0 = &quot;x&quot;&quot; still applies. The same is true for quantification over several numbers, e.g., &quot;for any numbers &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, &quot;xy&quot; = &quot;yx&quot;.&quot; This ability to carry over statements from the reals to the hyperreals is called the transfer principle. However, statements of the form &quot;for any &quot;set&quot; of numbers &quot;S&quot; ...&quot; may not carry over. The only properties that differ between the reals and the hyperreals are those that rely on quantification over sets, or other higher-level structures such as functions and relations, which are typically constructed out of sets. Each real set, function, and relation has its natural hyperreal extension, satisfying the same first-order properties. The kinds of logical sentences that obey this restriction on quantification are referred to as statements in first-order logic.

The transfer principle, however, does not mean that R and *R have identical behavior. For instance, in *R there exists an element &quot;ω&quot; such that
: formula_12
but there is no such number in R. (In other words, *R is not Archimedean.) This is possible because the nonexistence of &quot;ω&quot; cannot be expressed as a first-order statement.

== Use in analysis ==
Informal notations for non-real quantities have historically appeared in calculus in two contexts: as infinitesimals, like &quot;dx&quot;, and as the symbol ∞, used, for example, in limits of integration of improper integrals.

As an example of the transfer principle, the statement that for any nonzero number &quot;x&quot;, &quot;2x&quot; ≠ &quot;x&quot;, is true for the real numbers, and it is in the form required by the transfer principle, so it is also true for the hyperreal numbers. This shows that it is not possible to use a generic symbol such as ∞ for all the infinite quantities in the hyperreal system; infinite quantities differ in magnitude from other infinite quantities, and infinitesimals from other infinitesimals.

Similarly, the casual use of 1/0 = ∞ is invalid, since the transfer principle applies to the statement that zero has no multiplicative inverse. The rigorous counterpart of such a calculation would be that if ε is a non-zero infinitesimal, then 1/ε is infinite.

For any finite hyperreal number &quot;x&quot;, the standard part, st(&quot;x&quot;), is defined as the unique closest real number to &quot;x&quot;; it necessarily differs from &quot;x&quot; only infinitesimally. The standard part function can also be defined for infinite hyperreal numbers as follows: If x is a positive infinite hyperreal number, set st(&quot;x&quot;) to be the extended real number formula_13, and likewise, if x is a negative infinite hyperreal number, set st(&quot;x&quot;) to be formula_14 (the idea is that an infinite hyperreal number should be smaller than the &quot;true&quot; absolute infinity but closer to it than any real number is).

=== Differentiation ===
One of the key uses of the hyperreal number system is to give a precise meaning to the differential operator &quot;d&quot; as used by Leibniz to define the derivative and the integral.

For any real-valued function formula_15 the differential formula_16 is defined as a map which sends every ordered pair formula_17 (where formula_1 is real and formula_19 is nonzero infinitesimal) to an infinitesimal
: formula_20

Note that the very notation &quot;formula_19&quot; used to denote any infinitesimal is consistent with the above definition of the operator formula_22 for if one interprets formula_1 (as is commonly done) to be the function formula_24 then for every formula_17 the differential formula_26 will equal the infinitesimal formula_19.

A real-valued function formula_28 is said to be differentiable at a point formula_1 if the quotient
: formula_30
is the same for all nonzero infinitesimals formula_31 If so, this quotient is called the derivative of formula_28 at formula_1.

For example, to find the derivative of the function formula_34, let formula_19 be a non-zero infinitesimal. Then,

The use of the standard part in the definition of the derivative is a rigorous alternative to the traditional practice of neglecting the square of an infinitesimal quantity. Dual numbers are a number system based on this idea. After the third line of the differentiation above, the typical method from Newton through the 19th century would have been simply to discard the &quot;dx&quot;2 term. In the hyperreal system,
&quot;dx&quot;2 ≠ 0, since &quot;dx&quot; is nonzero, and the transfer principle can be applied to the statement that the square of any nonzero number is nonzero. However, the quantity &quot;dx&quot;2 is infinitesimally small compared to &quot;dx&quot;; that is, the hyperreal system contains a hierarchy of infinitesimal quantities.

Using hyperreal numbers for differentiation allows for a more algebraically manipulable approach to derivatives. In standard differentiation, partial differentials and higher-order differentials are not independently manipulable through algebraic techniques. However, using the hyperreals, a system can be established for doing so, though resulting in a slightly different notation.

=== Integration ===
Another key use of the hyperreal number system is to give a precise meaning to the integral sign ∫ used by Leibniz to define the definite integral.

For any infinitesimal functionformula_36one may define the integral formula_37as a map sending any ordered triple formula_38 (whereformula_39andformula_40are real, andformula_41is infinitesimal of the same sign as formula_42) to the value
: formula_43
whereformula_44is any hyperinteger number satisfyingformula_45

A real-valued function formula_28 is then said to be integrable over a closed intervalformula_47if for any nonzero infinitesimalformula_48the integral
: formula_49
is independent of the choice offormula_50 If so, this integral is called the definite integral (or antiderivative) of formula_28 onformula_52

This shows that using hyperreal numbers, Leibniz&#x27;s notation for the definite integral can actually be interpreted as a meaningful algebraic expression (just as the derivative can be interpreted as a meaningful quotient).

== Properties ==
The hyperreals *R form an ordered field containing the reals R as a subfield. Unlike the reals, the hyperreals do not form a standard metric space, but by virtue of their order they carry an order topology.

The use of the definite article &quot;the&quot; in the phrase &quot;the hyperreal numbers&quot; is somewhat misleading in that there is not a unique ordered field that is referred to in most treatments. However, a 2003 paper by Vladimir Kanovei and Saharon Shelah shows that there is a definable, countably saturated (meaning ω-saturated but not countable) elementary extension of the reals, which therefore has a good claim to the title of &quot;the&quot; hyperreal numbers. Furthermore, the field obtained by the ultrapower construction from the space of all real sequences, is unique up to isomorphism if one assumes the continuum hypothesis.

The condition of being a hyperreal field is a stronger one than that of being a real closed field strictly containing R. It is also stronger than that of being a superreal field in the sense of Dales and Woodin.

== Development ==
The hyperreals can be developed either axiomatically or by more constructively oriented methods. The essence of the axiomatic approach is to assert (1) the existence of at least one infinitesimal number, and (2) the validity of the transfer principle. In the following subsection we give a detailed outline of a more constructive approach. This method allows one to construct the hyperreals if given a set-theoretic object called an ultrafilter, but the ultrafilter itself cannot be explicitly constructed.

=== From Leibniz to Robinson ===
When Newton and (more explicitly) Leibniz introduced differentials, they used infinitesimals and these were still regarded as useful by later mathematicians such as Euler and Cauchy. Nonetheless these concepts were from the beginning seen as suspect, notably by George Berkeley. Berkeley&#x27;s criticism centered on a perceived shift in hypothesis in the definition of the derivative in terms of infinitesimals (or fluxions), where &quot;dx&quot; is assumed to be nonzero at the beginning of the calculation, and to vanish at its conclusion (see Ghosts of departed quantities for details). When in the 1800s calculus was put on a firm footing through the development of the (ε, δ)-definition of limit by Bolzano, Cauchy, Weierstrass, and others, infinitesimals were largely abandoned, though research in non-Archimedean fields continued (Ehrlich 2006).

However, in the 1960s Abraham Robinson showed how infinitely large and infinitesimal numbers can be rigorously defined and used to develop the field of nonstandard analysis. Robinson developed his theory nonconstructively, using model theory; however it is possible to proceed using only algebra and topology, and proving the transfer principle as a consequence of the definitions. In other words hyperreal numbers &quot;per se&quot;, aside from their use in nonstandard analysis, have no necessary relationship to model theory or first order logic, although they were discovered by the application of model theoretic techniques from logic. Hyper-real fields were in fact originally introduced by Hewitt (1948) by purely algebraic techniques, using an ultrapower construction.

=== Ultrapower construction ===

We are going to construct a hyperreal field via sequences of reals. In fact we can add and multiply sequences componentwise; for example:
: formula_53
and analogously for multiplication.
This turns the set of such sequences into a commutative ring, which is in fact a real algebra A. We have a natural embedding of R in A by identifying the real number &quot;r&quot; with the sequence (&quot;r&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, …) and this identification preserves the corresponding algebraic operations of the reals. The intuitive motivation is, for example, to represent an infinitesimal number using a sequence that approaches zero. The inverse of such a sequence would represent an infinite number. As we will see below, the difficulties arise because of the need to define rules for comparing such sequences in a manner that, although inevitably somewhat arbitrary, must be self-consistent and well defined. For example, we may have two sequences that differ in their first &quot;n&quot; members, but are equal after that; such sequences should clearly be considered as representing the same hyperreal number. Similarly, most sequences oscillate randomly forever, and we must find some way of taking such a sequence and interpreting it as, say, formula_54, where formula_55 is a certain infinitesimal number.

Comparing sequences is thus a delicate matter. We could, for example, try to define a relation between sequences in a componentwise fashion:
: formula_56
but here we run into trouble, since some entries of the first sequence may be bigger than the corresponding entries of the second sequence, and some others may be smaller. It follows that the relation defined in this way is only a partial order. To get around this, we have to specify which positions matter. Since there are infinitely many indices, we don&#x27;t want finite sets of indices to matter. A consistent choice of index sets that matter is given by any free ultrafilter &quot;U&quot; on the natural numbers; these can be characterized as ultrafilters that do not contain any finite sets. (The good news is that Zorn&#x27;s lemma guarantees the existence of many such &quot;U&quot;; the bad news is that they cannot be explicitly constructed.) We think of &quot;U&quot; as singling out those sets of indices that &quot;matter&quot;: We write (&quot;a&quot;0, &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, ...) ≤ (&quot;b&quot;0, &quot;b&quot;1, &quot;b&quot;2, ...) if and only if the set of natural numbers { &quot;n&quot; : &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; } is in &quot;U&quot;.

This is a total preorder and it turns into a total order if we agree not to distinguish between two sequences &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; if &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; and &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot;. With this identification, the ordered field *R of hyperreals is constructed. From an algebraic point of view, &quot;U&quot; allows us to define a corresponding maximal ideal I in the commutative ring A (namely, the set of the sequences that vanish in some element of &quot;U&quot;), and then to define *R as A/I; as the quotient of a commutative ring by a maximal ideal, *R is a field. This is also notated A/&quot;U&quot;, directly in terms of the free ultrafilter &quot;U&quot;; the two are equivalent. The maximality of I follows from the possibility of, given a sequence &quot;a&quot;, constructing a sequence &quot;b&quot; inverting the non-null elements of &quot;a&quot; and not altering its null entries. If the set on which &quot;a&quot; vanishes is not in &quot;U&quot;, the product &quot;ab&quot; is identified with the number 1, and any ideal containing 1 must be &quot;A&quot;. In the resulting field, these &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are inverses.

The field A/&quot;U&quot; is an ultrapower of R.
Since this field contains R it has cardinality at least that of the continuum. Since A has cardinality
: formula_57
it is also no larger than formula_58, and hence has the same cardinality as R.

One question we might ask is whether, if we had chosen a different free ultrafilter &quot;V&quot;, the quotient field A/&quot;U&quot; would be isomorphic as an ordered field to A/&quot;V&quot;. This question turns out to be equivalent to the continuum hypothesis; in ZFC with the continuum hypothesis we can prove this field is unique up to order isomorphism, and in ZFC with the negation of continuum hypothesis we can prove that there are non-order-isomorphic pairs of fields that are both countably indexed ultrapowers of the reals.

For more information about this method of construction, see ultraproduct.

=== An intuitive approach to the ultrapower construction ===

The following is an intuitive way of understanding the hyperreal numbers. The approach taken here is very close to the one in the book by Goldblatt. Recall that the sequences converging to zero are sometimes called infinitely small. These are almost the infinitesimals in a sense; the true infinitesimals include certain classes of sequences that contain a sequence converging to zero.

Let us see where these classes come from. Consider first the sequences of real numbers. They form a ring, that is, one can multiply, add and subtract them, but not necessarily divide by a non-zero element. The real numbers are considered as the constant sequences, the sequence is zero if it is identically zero, that is, &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 0 for all &quot;n&quot;.

In our ring of sequences one can get &quot;ab&quot; = 0 with neither &quot;a&quot; = 0 nor &quot;b&quot; = 0. Thus, if for two sequences formula_59 one has &quot;ab&quot; = 0, at least one of them should be declared zero. Surprisingly enough, there is a consistent way to do it. As a result, the equivalence classes of sequences that differ by some sequence declared zero will form a field, which is called a hyperreal field. It will contain the infinitesimals in addition to the ordinary real numbers, as well as infinitely large numbers (the reciprocals of infinitesimals, including those represented by sequences diverging to infinity). Also every hyperreal that is not infinitely large will be infinitely close to an ordinary real, in other words, it will be the sum of an ordinary real and an infinitesimal.

This construction is parallel to the construction of the reals from the rationals given by Cantor. He started with the ring of the Cauchy sequences of rationals and declared all the sequences that converge to zero to be zero. The result is the reals. To continue the construction of hyperreals, consider the zero sets of our sequences, that is, the formula_60, that is, formula_61 is the set of indexes formula_62 for which formula_63. It is clear that if formula_64, then the union of formula_61 and formula_66 is N (the set of all natural numbers), so:
# One of the sequences that vanish on two complementary sets should be declared zero.
# If formula_67 is declared zero, formula_68 should be declared zero too, no matter what formula_69 is.
# If both formula_67 and formula_69 are declared zero, then formula_72 should also be declared zero.
Now the idea is to single out a bunch &quot;U&quot; of subsets &quot;X&quot; of N and to declare that formula_73 if and only if formula_61 belongs to &quot;U&quot;. From the above conditions one can see that:
# From two complementary sets one belongs to &quot;U&quot;.
# Any set having a subset that belongs to &quot;U&quot;, also belongs to &quot;U&quot;.
# An intersection of any two sets belonging to &quot;U&quot; belongs to &quot;U&quot;.
# Finally, we do not want the empty set to belong to &quot;U&quot; because then everything would belong to &quot;U&quot;, as every set has the empty set as a subset.

Any family of sets that satisfies (2–4) is called a filter (an example: the complements to the finite sets, it is called the Fréchet filter and it is used in the usual limit theory). If (1) also holds, U is called an ultrafilter (because you can add no more sets to it without breaking it). The only explicitly known example of an ultrafilter is the family of sets containing a given element (in our case, say, the number 10). Such ultrafilters are called trivial, and if we use it in our construction, we come back to the ordinary real numbers. Any ultrafilter containing a finite set is trivial. It is known that any filter can be extended to an ultrafilter, but the proof uses the axiom of choice. The existence of a nontrivial ultrafilter (the ultrafilter lemma) can be added as an extra axiom, as it is weaker than the axiom of choice.

Now if we take a nontrivial ultrafilter (which is an extension of the Fréchet filter) and do our construction, we get the hyperreal numbers as a result.

If formula_28 is a real function of a real variable formula_1 then formula_28 naturally extends to a hyperreal function of a hyperreal variable by composition:
: formula_78
where formula_79 means &quot;the equivalence class of the sequence formula_80 relative to our ultrafilter&quot;, two sequences being in the same class if and only if the zero set of their difference belongs to our ultrafilter.

All the arithmetical expressions and formulas make sense for hyperreals and hold true if they are true for the ordinary reals. It turns out that any finite (that is, such that formula_81 for some ordinary real formula_67) hyperreal formula_1 will be of the form formula_84 where formula_85 is an ordinary (called standard) real and formula_86 is an infinitesimal. It can be proven by bisection method used in proving the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, the property (1) of ultrafilters turns out to be crucial.

== Properties of infinitesimal and infinite numbers ==

The finite elements F of *R form a local ring, and in fact a valuation ring, with the unique maximal ideal S being the infinitesimals; the quotient F/S is isomorphic to the reals. Hence we have a homomorphic mapping, st(&quot;x&quot;), from F to R whose kernel consists of the infinitesimals and which sends every element &quot;x&quot; of F to a unique real number whose difference from x is in S; which is to say, is infinitesimal. Put another way, every &quot;finite&quot; nonstandard real number is &quot;very close&quot; to a unique real number, in the sense that if &quot;x&quot; is a finite nonstandard real, then there exists one and only one real number st(&quot;x&quot;) such that &quot;x&quot; – st(&quot;x&quot;) is infinitesimal. This number st(&quot;x&quot;) is called the standard part of &quot;x&quot;, conceptually the same as &quot;x&quot; &quot;to the nearest real number&quot;. This operation is an order-preserving homomorphism and hence is well-behaved both algebraically and order theoretically. It is order-preserving though not isotonic; i.e. formula_87 implies formula_88, but formula_89 does not imply formula_90.

* We have, if both &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are finite, formula_91 formula_92
* If &quot;x&quot; is finite and not infinitesimal. formula_93
* &quot;x&quot; is real if and only if formula_94
The map st is continuous with respect to the order topology on the finite hyperreals; in fact it is locally constant.

== Hyperreal fields ==
Suppose &quot;X&quot; is a Tychonoff space, also called a T3.5 space, and C(&quot;X&quot;) is the algebra of continuous real-valued functions on &quot;X&quot;. Suppose &quot;M&quot; is a maximal ideal in C(&quot;X&quot;). Then the factor algebra &quot;A&quot; = C(&quot;X&quot;)/&quot;M&quot; is a totally ordered field &quot;F&quot; containing the reals. If &quot;F&quot; strictly contains R then &quot;M&quot; is called a hyperreal ideal (terminology due to Hewitt (1948)) and &quot;F&quot; a hyperreal field. Note that no assumption is being made that the cardinality of &quot;F&quot; is greater than R; it can in fact have the same cardinality.

An important special case is where the topology on &quot;X&quot; is the discrete topology; in this case &quot;X&quot; can be identified with a cardinal number κ and C(&quot;X&quot;) with the real algebra Rκ of functions from κ to R. The hyperreal fields we obtain in this case are called ultrapowers of R and are identical to the ultrapowers constructed via free ultrafilters in model theory.

<text>In mathematics, the surreal number system is a totally ordered proper class containing not only the real numbers but also infinite and infinitesimal numbers, respectively larger or smaller in absolute value than any positive real number. Research on the Go endgame by John Horton Conway led to the original definition and construction of surreal numbers. Conway&#x27;s construction was introduced in Donald Knuth&#x27;s 1974 book Surreal Numbers: How Two Ex-Students Turned On to Pure Mathematics and Found Total Happiness. 

The surreals share many properties with the reals, including the usual arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division); as such, they form an ordered field. If formulated in von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory, the surreal numbers are a universal ordered field in the sense that all other ordered fields, such as the rationals, the reals, the rational functions, the Levi-Civita field, the superreal numbers (including the hyperreal numbers) can be realized as subfields of the surreals. The surreals also contain all transfinite ordinal numbers; the arithmetic on them is given by the natural operations. It has also been shown (in von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory) that the maximal class hyperreal field is isomorphic to the maximal class surreal field.

== History of the concept ==
Research on the Go endgame by John Horton Conway led to the original definition and construction of the surreal numbers. Conway&#x27;s construction was introduced in Donald Knuth&#x27;s 1974 book &quot;Surreal Numbers: How Two Ex-Students Turned On to Pure Mathematics and Found Total Happiness&quot;. In his book, which takes the form of a dialogue, Knuth coined the term &quot;surreal numbers&quot; for what Conway had called simply &quot;numbers&quot;. Conway later adopted Knuth&#x27;s term, and used surreals for analyzing games in his 1976 book &quot;On Numbers and Games&quot;.

A separate route to defining the surreals began in 1907, when Hans Hahn introduced Hahn series as a generalization of formal power series, and Felix Hausdorff introduced certain ordered sets called -sets for ordinals and asked if it was possible to find a compatible ordered group or field structure. In 1962, Norman Alling used a modified form of Hahn series to construct such ordered fields associated to certain ordinals and, in 1987, he showed that taking to be the class of all ordinals in his construction gives a class that is an ordered field isomorphic to the surreal numbers.

If the surreals are considered as &#x27;just&#x27; a proper-class-sized real closed field, Alling&#x27;s 1962 paper handles the case of strongly inaccessible cardinals which can naturally be considered as proper classes by cutting off the cumulative hierarchy of the universe one stage above the cardinal, and Alling accordingly deserves much credit for the discovery/invention of the surreals in this sense. There is an important additional field structure on the surreals that isn&#x27;t visible through this lens however, namely the notion of a &#x27;birthday&#x27; and the corresponding natural description of the surreals as the result of a cut-filling process along their birthdays given by Conway. This additional structure has become fundamental to a modern understanding of the surreal numbers, and Conway is thus given credit for discovering the surreals as we know them today—Alling himself gives Conway full credit in a 1985 paper preceding his book on the subject.

==Description==

===Notation===
In the context of surreal numbers, an ordered pair of sets and , which is written as in many other mathematical contexts, is instead written including the extra space adjacent to each brace. When a set is empty, it is often simply omitted. When a set is explicitly described by its elements, the pair of braces that encloses the list of elements is often omitted. When a union of sets is taken, the operator that represents that is often a comma. For example, instead of , which is common notation in other contexts, we typically write .

===Outline of construction===
In the Conway construction, the surreal numbers are constructed in stages, along with an ordering ≤ such that for any two surreal numbers and , or . (Both may hold, in which case and are equivalent and denote the same number.) Each number is formed from an ordered pair of subsets of numbers already constructed: given subsets and of numbers such that all the members of are strictly less than all the members of , then the pair represents a number intermediate in value between all the members of and all the members of .

Different subsets may end up defining the same number: and may define the same number even if and . (A similar phenomenon occurs when rational numbers are defined as quotients of integers: and are different representations of the same rational number.) So strictly speaking, the surreal numbers are equivalence classes of representations of the form that designate the same number.

In the first stage of construction, there are no previously existing numbers so the only representation must use the empty set: . This representation, where and are both empty, is called 0. Subsequent stages yield forms like



and



The integers are thus contained within the surreal numbers. (The above identities are definitions, in the sense that the right-hand side is a name for the left-hand side. That the names are actually appropriate will be evident when the arithmetic operations on surreal numbers are defined, as in the section below). Similarly, representations such as



arise, so that the dyadic rationals (rational numbers whose denominators are powers of 2) are contained within the surreal numbers.

After an infinite number of stages, infinite subsets become available, so that any real number can be represented by 
where is the set of all dyadic rationals less than and 
 is the set of all dyadic rationals greater than (reminiscent of a Dedekind cut). Thus the real numbers are also embedded within the surreals.

There are also representations like


where is a transfinite number greater than all integers and is an infinitesimal greater than 0 but less than any positive real number. Moreover, the standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) can be extended to these non-real numbers in a manner that turns the collection of surreal numbers into an ordered field, so that one can talk about or and so forth.

==Construction==

Surreal numbers are constructed inductively as equivalence classes of pairs of sets of surreal numbers, restricted by the condition that each element of the first set is smaller than each element of the second set. The construction consists of three interdependent parts: the construction rule, the comparison rule and the equivalence rule.

===Forms===
A &quot;form&quot; is a pair of sets of surreal numbers, called its &quot;left set&quot; and its &quot;right set&quot;. A form with left set and right set is written . When and are given as lists of elements, the braces around them are omitted.

Either or both of the left and right set of a form may be the empty set. The form with both left and right set empty is also written .

===Numeric forms and their equivalence classes===

Construction rule
:A form is &quot;numeric&quot; if the intersection of and is the empty set and each element of is greater than every element of , according to the order relation ≤ given by the comparison rule below.

The numeric forms are placed in equivalence classes; each such equivalence class is a &quot;surreal number&quot;. The elements of the left and right sets of a form are drawn from the universe of the surreal numbers (not of &quot;forms&quot;, but of their &quot;equivalence classes&quot;).

Equivalence rule
: Two numeric forms and are forms of the same number (lie in the same equivalence class) if and only if both and .

An ordering relationship must be antisymmetric, i.e., it must have the property that (i. e., and are both true) only when and are the same object. This is not the case for surreal number &quot;forms&quot;, but is true by construction for surreal &quot;numbers&quot; (equivalence classes).

The equivalence class containing is labeled 0; in other words, is a form of the surreal number 0.

===Order===

The recursive definition of surreal numbers is completed by defining comparison:

Given numeric forms and , if and only if both:
*There is no such that . That is, every element in the left part of is strictly smaller than .
*There is no such that . That is, every element in the right part of is strictly larger than .
Surreal numbers can be compared to each other (or to numeric forms) by choosing a numeric form from its equivalence class to represent each surreal number.

===Induction===

This group of definitions is recursive, and requires some form of mathematical induction to define the universe of objects (forms and numbers) that occur in them. The only surreal numbers reachable via &quot;finite induction&quot; are the dyadic fractions; a wider universe is reachable given some form of transfinite induction.

====Induction rule====
* There is a generation , in which 0 consists of the single form .
* Given any ordinal number , the generation is the set of all surreal numbers that are generated by the construction rule from subsets of formula_1.

The base case is actually a special case of the induction rule, with 0 taken as a label for the &quot;least ordinal&quot;. Since there exists no with , the expression formula_2 is the empty set; the only subset of the empty set is the empty set, and therefore consists of a single surreal form lying in a single equivalence class 0.

For every finite ordinal number , is well-ordered by the ordering induced by the comparison rule on the surreal numbers.

The first iteration of the induction rule produces the three numeric forms (the form is non-numeric because ). The equivalence class containing is labeled 1 and the equivalence class containing is labeled −1. These three labels have a special significance in the axioms that define a ring; they are the additive identity (0), the multiplicative identity (1), and the additive inverse of 1 (−1). The arithmetic operations defined below are consistent with these labels.

For every , since every valid form in is also a valid form in , all of the numbers in also appear in (as supersets of their representation in ). (The set union expression appears in our construction rule, rather than the simpler form , so that the definition also makes sense when is a limit ordinal.) Numbers in that are a superset of some number in are said to have been &quot;inherited&quot; from generation . The smallest value of for which a given surreal number appears in is called its &quot;birthday&quot;. For example, the birthday of 0 is 0, and the birthday of −1 is 1.

A second iteration of the construction rule yields the following ordering of equivalence classes:
: 
: 
: 

Comparison of these equivalence classes is consistent, irrespective of the choice of form. Three observations follow:
# contains four new surreal numbers. Two contain extremal forms: contains all numbers from previous generations in its right set, and contains all numbers from previous generations in its left set. The others have a form that partitions all numbers from previous generations into two non-empty sets.
# Every surreal number that existed in the previous &quot;generation&quot; exists also in this generation, and includes at least one new form: a partition of all numbers &quot;other than&quot; from previous generations into a left set (all numbers less than ) and a right set (all numbers greater than ).
# The equivalence class of a number depends on only the maximal element of its left set and the minimal element of the right set.

The informal interpretations of and are &quot;the number just after 1&quot; and &quot;the number just before −1&quot; respectively; their equivalence classes are labeled 2 and −2. The informal interpretations of and are &quot;the number halfway between 0 and 1&quot; and &quot;the number halfway between −1 and 0&quot; respectively; their equivalence classes are labeled and −. These labels will also be justified by the rules for surreal addition and multiplication below.

The equivalence classes at each stage of induction may be characterized by their -&quot;complete forms&quot; (each containing as many elements as possible of previous generations in its left and right sets). Either this complete form contains &quot;every&quot; number from previous generations in its left or right set, in which case this is the first generation in which this number occurs; or it contains all numbers from previous generations but one, in which case it is a new form of this one number. We retain the labels from the previous generation for these &quot;old&quot; numbers, and write the ordering above using the old and new labels:

The third observation extends to all surreal numbers with finite left and right sets. (For infinite left or right sets, this is valid in an altered form, since infinite sets might not contain a maximal or minimal element.) The number is therefore equivalent to ; one can establish that these are forms of 3 by using the &quot;birthday property&quot;, which is a consequence of the rules above.

====Birthday property====
A form occurring in generation represents a number inherited from an earlier generation if and only if there is some number in that is greater than all elements of and less than all elements of the . (In other words, if and are already separated by a number created at an earlier stage, then does not represent a new number but one already constructed.) If represents a number from any generation earlier than , there is a least such generation , and exactly one number with this least as its birthday that lies between and ; is a form of this . In other words, it lies in the equivalence class in that is a superset of the representation of in generation .

==Arithmetic==

The addition, negation (additive inverse), and multiplication of surreal number &quot;forms&quot; and are defined by three recursive formulas.

===Negation===

Negation of a given number is defined by
formula_3
where the negation of a set of numbers is given by the set of the negated elements of :
formula_4

This formula involves the negation of the surreal &quot;numbers&quot; appearing in the left and right sets of , which is to be understood as the result of choosing a form of the number, evaluating the negation of this form, and taking the equivalence class of the resulting form. This makes sense only if the result is the same, irrespective of the choice of form of the operand. This can be proved inductively using the fact that the numbers occurring in and are drawn from generations earlier than that in which the form first occurs, and observing the special case:
formula_5

===Addition===
The definition of addition is also a recursive formula:
formula_6
where

formula_7

This formula involves sums of one of the original operands and a surreal number drawn from the left or right set of the other. It can be proved inductively with the special cases:
formula_8
formula_9
formula_10
For example:
which by the birthday property is a form of 1. This justifies the label used in the previous section.

====Subtraction====
Subtraction is defined with addition and negation:
formula_11

===Multiplication===
Multiplication can be defined recursively as well, beginning from the special cases involving 0, the multiplicative identity 1, and its additive inverse −1:
formula_12
The formula contains arithmetic expressions involving the operands and their left and right sets, such as the expression formula_13 that appears in the left set of the product of and . This is understood as formula_14, the set of numbers generated by picking all possible combinations of members of formula_15 and formula_16, and substituting them into the expression.

For example, to show that the square of is :

=== Division ===
The definition of division is done in terms of the reciprocal and multiplication:

formula_17

where

formula_18

for positive . Only positive are permitted in the formula, with any nonpositive terms being ignored (and are always positive). This formula involves not only recursion in terms of being able to divide by numbers from the left and right sets of , but also recursion in that the members of the left and right sets of itself. 0 is always a member of the left set of , and that can be used to find more terms in a recursive fashion. For example, if }, then we know a left term of will be 0. This in turn means is a right term. This means
formula_19
is a left term. This means
formula_20
will be a right term. Continuing, this gives
formula_21

For negative , is given by
formula_22

If , then is undefined.

===Consistency===
It can be shown that the definitions of negation, addition and multiplication are consistent, in the sense that:
* Addition and negation are defined recursively in terms of &quot;simpler&quot; addition and negation steps, so that operations on numbers with birthday will eventually be expressed entirely in terms of operations on numbers with birthdays less than ;
* Multiplication is defined recursively in terms of additions, negations, and &quot;simpler&quot; multiplication steps, so that the product of numbers with birthday will eventually be expressed entirely in terms of sums and differences of products of numbers with birthdays less than ;
* As long as the operands are well-defined surreal number forms (each element of the left set is less than each element of the right set), the results are again well-defined surreal number forms;
* The operations can be extended to &quot;numbers&quot; (equivalence classes of forms): the result of negating or adding or multiplying and will represent the same number regardless of the choice of form of and ; and
* These operations obey the associativity, commutativity, additive inverse, and distributivity axioms in the definition of a field, with additive identity and multiplicative identity .

With these rules one can now verify that the numbers found in the first few generations were properly labeled. The construction rule is repeated to obtain more generations of surreals:
: 
: 

===Arithmetic closure===

For each natural number (finite ordinal) , all numbers generated in are dyadic fractions, i.e., can be written as an irreducible fraction , where and are integers and .

The set of all surreal numbers that are generated in some for finite may be denoted as formula_23. One may form the three classes
formula_24
of which is the union. No individual is closed under addition and multiplication (except ), but is; it is the subring of the rationals consisting of all dyadic fractions.

There are infinite ordinal numbers for which the set of surreal numbers with birthday less than is closed under the different arithmetic operations. For any ordinal , the set of surreal numbers with birthday less than (using powers of) is closed under addition and forms a group; for birthday less than it is closed under multiplication and forms a ring; and for birthday less than an (ordinal) epsilon number it is closed under multiplicative inverse and forms a field. The latter sets are also closed under the exponential function as defined by Kruskal and Gonshor.

However, it is always possible to construct a surreal number that is greater than any member of a set of surreals (by including the set on the left side of the constructor) and thus the collection of surreal numbers is a proper class. With their ordering and algebraic operations they constitute an ordered field, with the caveat that they do not form a set. In fact it is the biggest ordered field, in that every ordered field is a subfield of the surreal numbers. The class of all surreal numbers is denoted by the symbol formula_25.

== Infinity ==

Define as the set of all surreal numbers generated by the construction rule from subsets of . (This is the same inductive step as before, since the ordinal number is the smallest ordinal that is larger than all natural numbers; however, the set union appearing in the inductive step is now an infinite union of finite sets, and so this step can be performed only in a set theory that allows such a union.) A unique infinitely large positive number occurs in :
formula_26
 also contains objects that can be identified as the rational numbers. For example, the -complete form of the fraction is given by:
formula_27
The product of this form of with any form of 3 is a form whose left set contains only numbers less than 1 and whose right set contains only numbers greater than 1; the birthday property implies that this product is a form of 1.

Not only do all the rest of the rational numbers appear in ; the remaining finite real numbers do too. For example,
formula_28

The only infinities in are and ; but there are other non-real numbers in among the reals. Consider the smallest positive number in :
formula_29
This number is larger than zero but less than all positive dyadic fractions. It is therefore an infinitesimal number, often labeled . The -complete form of (respectively ) is the same as the -complete form of 0, except that 0 is included in the left (respectively right) set. The only &quot;pure&quot; infinitesimals in are and its additive inverse ; adding them to any dyadic fraction produces the numbers , which also lie in .

One can determine the relationship between and by multiplying particular forms of them to obtain:
This expression is well-defined only in a set theory which permits transfinite induction up to . In such a system, one can demonstrate that all the elements of the left set of are positive infinitesimals and all the elements of the right set are positive infinities, and therefore is the oldest positive finite number, 1. Consequently, . Some authors systematically use in place of the symbol .

===Contents of &quot;S&quot;===

Given any in , exactly one of the following is true:
* and are both empty, in which case ;
* is empty and some integer is greater than every element of , in which case equals the smallest such integer ;
* is empty and no integer is greater than every element of , in which case equals ;
* is empty and some integer is less than every element of , in which case equals the largest such integer ;
* is empty and no integer is less than every element of , in which case equals ;
* and are both non-empty, and:
** Some dyadic fraction is &quot;strictly between&quot; and (greater than all elements of and less than all elements of ), in which case equals the oldest such dyadic fraction ;
** No dyadic fraction lies strictly between and , but some dyadic fraction formula_30 is greater than or equal to all elements of and less than all elements of , in which case equals ;
** No dyadic fraction lies strictly between and , but some dyadic fraction formula_31 is greater than all elements of and less than or equal to all elements of , in which case equals ;
** Every dyadic fraction is either greater than some element of or less than some element of , in which case is some real number that has no representation as a dyadic fraction.

 is not an algebraic field, because it is not closed under arithmetic operations; consider , whose form
formula_32
does not lie in any number in . The maximal subset of that is closed under (finite series of) arithmetic operations is the field of real numbers, obtained by leaving out the infinities , the infinitesimals , and the infinitesimal neighbors of each nonzero dyadic fraction .

This construction of the real numbers differs from the Dedekind cuts of standard analysis in that it starts from dyadic fractions rather than general rationals and naturally identifies each dyadic fraction in with its forms in previous generations. (The -complete forms of real elements of are in one-to-one correspondence with the reals obtained by Dedekind cuts, under the proviso that Dedekind reals corresponding to rational numbers are represented by the form in which the cut point is omitted from both left and right sets.) The rationals are not an identifiable stage in the surreal construction; they are merely the subset of containing all elements such that for some and some nonzero , both drawn from . By demonstrating that is closed under individual repetitions of the surreal arithmetic operations, one can show that it is a field; and by showing that every element of is reachable from by a finite series (no longer than two, actually) of arithmetic operations &quot;including multiplicative inversion&quot;, one can show that is strictly smaller than the subset of identified with the reals.

The set has the same cardinality as the real numbers . This can be demonstrated by exhibiting surjective mappings from to the closed unit interval of and vice versa. Mapping onto is routine; map numbers less than or equal to (including ) to 0, numbers greater than or equal to (including ) to 1, and numbers between and to their equivalent in (mapping the infinitesimal neighbors of each dyadic fraction , along with itself, to ). To map onto , map the (open) central third (, ) of onto ; the central third (, ) of the upper third to ; and so forth. This maps a nonempty open interval of onto each element of , monotonically. The residue of consists of the Cantor set , each point of which is uniquely identified by a partition of the central-third intervals into left and right sets, corresponding precisely to a form in . This places the Cantor set in one-to-one correspondence with the set of surreal numbers with birthday .

== Transfinite induction ==

Continuing to perform transfinite induction beyond produces more ordinal numbers , each represented as the largest surreal number having birthday . (This is essentially a definition of the ordinal numbers resulting from transfinite induction.) The first such ordinal is . There is another positive infinite number in generation :
The surreal number is not an ordinal; the ordinal is not the successor of any ordinal. This is a surreal number with birthday , which is labeled on the basis that it coincides with the sum of and . Similarly, there are two new infinitesimal numbers in generation :
: and

At a later stage of transfinite induction, there is a number larger than for all natural numbers :
This number may be labeled both because its birthday is (the first ordinal number not reachable from by the successor operation) and because it coincides with the surreal sum of and ; it may also be labeled because it coincides with the product of and . It is the second limit ordinal; reaching it from via the construction step requires a transfinite induction on
formula_33
This involves an infinite union of infinite sets, which is a &quot;stronger&quot; set theoretic operation than the previous transfinite induction required.

Note that the &quot;conventional&quot; addition and multiplication of ordinals does not always coincide with these operations on their surreal representations. The sum of ordinals equals , but the surreal sum is commutative and produces . The addition and multiplication of the surreal numbers associated with ordinals coincides with the natural sum and natural product of ordinals.

Just as is bigger than for any natural number , there is a surreal number that is infinite but smaller than for any natural number . That is, is defined by
where on the right hand side the notation is used to mean . It can be identified as the product of and the form of . The birthday of is the limit ordinal .

== Powers of &quot;ω&quot; and the Conway normal form ==

To classify the &quot;orders&quot; of infinite and infinitesimal surreal numbers, also known as archimedean classes, Conway associated to each surreal number the surreal number
where and range over the positive real numbers. If then is &quot;infinitely greater&quot; than , in that it is greater than for all real numbers . Powers of also satisfy the conditions
* ,
so they behave the way one would expect powers to behave.

Each power of also has the redeeming feature of being the &quot;simplest&quot; surreal number in its archimedean class; conversely, every archimedean class within the surreal numbers contains a unique simplest member. Thus, for every positive surreal number there will always exist some positive real number and some surreal number so that is &quot;infinitely smaller&quot; than . The exponent is the &quot;base logarithm&quot; of , defined on the positive surreals; it can be demonstrated that maps the positive surreals onto the surreals and that

This gets extended by transfinite induction so that every surreal number has a &quot;normal form&quot; analogous to the Cantor normal form for ordinal numbers. This is the Conway normal form: Every surreal number may be uniquely written as
where every is a nonzero real number and the s form a strictly decreasing sequence of surreal numbers. This &quot;sum&quot;, however, may have infinitely many terms, and in general has the length of an arbitrary ordinal number. (Zero corresponds of course to the case of an empty sequence, and is the only surreal number with no leading exponent.)

Looked at in this manner, the surreal numbers resemble a power series field, except that the decreasing sequences of exponents must be bounded in length by an ordinal and are not allowed to be as long as the class of ordinals. This is the basis for the formulation of the surreal numbers as a Hahn series.

==Gaps and continuity==

In contrast to the real numbers, a (proper) subset of the surreal numbers does not have a least upper (or lower) bound unless it has a maximal (minimal) element. Conway defines a gap as such that every element of is less than every element of , and formula_34; this is not a number because at least one of the sides is a proper class. Though similar, gaps are not quite the same as Dedekind cuts, but we can still talk about a completion formula_35 of the surreal numbers with the natural ordering which is a (proper class-sized) linear continuum.

For instance there is no least positive infinite surreal, but the gap

formula_36

is greater than all real numbers and less than all positive infinite surreals, and is thus the least upper bound of the reals in formula_35. Similarly the gap formula_38 is larger than all surreal numbers. (This is an esoteric pun: In the general construction of ordinals, &quot;is&quot; the set of ordinals smaller than , and we can use this equivalence to write in the surreals; formula_39 denotes the class of ordinal numbers, and because formula_39 is cofinal in formula_25 we have formula_42 by extension.)

With a bit of set-theoretic care, formula_25 can be equipped with a topology where the open sets are unions of open intervals (indexed by proper sets) and continuous functions can be defined. An equivalent of Cauchy sequences can be defined as well, although they have to be indexed by the class of ordinals; these will always converge, but the limit may be either a number or a gap that can be expressed as
formula_44
with decreasing and having no lower bound in formula_25. (All such gaps can be understood as Cauchy sequences themselves, but there are other types of gap that are not limits, such as and formula_39).

==Exponential function==
Based on unpublished work by Kruskal, a construction (by transfinite induction) that extends the real exponential function (with base ) to the surreals was carried through by Gonshor.

===Other exponentials===
The powers of function is also an exponential function, but does not have the properties desired for an extension of the function on the reals. It will, however, be needed in the development of the base- exponential, and it is this function that is meant whenever the notation is used in the following.

When is a dyadic fraction, the power function formula_47, may be composed from multiplication, multiplicative inverse and square root, all of which can be defined inductively. Its values are completely determined by the basic relation , and where defined it necessarily agrees with any other exponentiation that can exist.

===Basic induction===
The induction steps for the surreal exponential are based on the series expansion for the real exponential,
formula_48
more specifically those partial sums that can be shown by basic algebra to be positive but less than all later ones. For positive these are denoted and include all partial sums; for negative but finite, denotes the odd steps in the series starting from the first one with a positive real part (which always exists). For negative infinite the odd-numbered partial sums are strictly decreasing and the notation denotes the empty set, but it turns out that the corresponding elements are not needed in the induction.

The relations that hold for real are thenandand this can be extended to the surreals with the definition

formula_49

This is well-defined for all surreal arguments (the value exists and does not depend on the choice of and ).

===Results===
Using this definition, the following hold:
* is a strictly increasing positive function, 
* satisfies 
* is a surjection (onto formula_50) and has a well-defined inverse, 
* coincides with the usual exponential function on the reals (and thus )
* For infinitesimal, the value of the formal power series (Taylor expansion) of is well defined and coincides with the inductive definition
** When is given in Conway normal form, the set of exponents in the result is well-ordered and the coefficients are finite sums, directly giving the normal form of the result (which has a leading )
** Similarly, for infinitesimally close to , is given by power series expansion of 
* For positive infinite , is infinite as well
** If has the form (), has the form where is a strictly increasing function of . In fact there is an inductively defined bijection formula_51 whose inverse can also be defined inductively
** If is &quot;pure infinite&quot; with normal form where all , then 
** Similarly, for , the inverse is given by 
* Any surreal number can be written as the sum of a pure infinite, a real and an infinitesimal part, and the exponential is the product of the partial results given above
** The normal form can be written out by multiplying the infinite part (a single power of ) and the real exponential into the power series resulting from the infinitesimal
** Conversely, dividing out the leading term of the normal form will bring any surreal number into the form , for , where each factor has a form for which a way of calculating the logarithm has been given above; the sum is then the general logarithm
*** While there is no general inductive definition of (unlike for ), the partial results are given in terms of such definitions. In this way, the logarithm can be calculated explicitly, without reference to the fact that it&#x27;s the inverse of the exponential.
* The exponential function is much greater than any finite power
** For any positive infinite and any finite , is infinite
** For any integer and surreal , . This stronger constraint is one of the Ressayre axioms for the real exponential field
* satisfies all the Ressayre axioms for the real exponential field
** The surreals with exponential is an elementary extension of the real exponential field
** For an ordinal epsilon number, the set of surreal numbers with birthday less than constitute a field that is closed under exponentials, and is likewise an elementary extension of the real exponential field

===Examples===
The surreal exponential is essentially given by its behaviour on positive powers of , i.e., the function , combined with well-known behaviour on finite numbers. Only examples of the former will be given. In addition, holds for a large part of its range, for instance for any finite number with positive real part and any infinite number that is less than some iterated power of ( for some number of levels).
* and 
** This shows that the &quot;power of &quot; function is not compatible with , since compatibility would demand a value of here
* 

===Exponentiation===
A general exponentiation can be defined as , giving an interpretation to expressions like . Again it is essential to distinguish this definition from the &quot;powers of &quot; function, especially if may occur as the base.

== Surcomplex numbers ==

A surcomplex number is a number of the form , where and are surreal numbers and is the square root of . The surcomplex numbers form an algebraically closed field (except for being a proper class), isomorphic to the algebraic closure of the field generated by extending the rational numbers by a proper class of algebraically independent transcendental elements. Up to field isomorphism, this fact characterizes the field of surcomplex numbers within any fixed set theory.

==Games==
The definition of surreal numbers contained one restriction: each element of must be strictly less than each element of . If this restriction is dropped we can generate a more general class known as games. All games are constructed according to this rule:

; Construction rule : If and are two sets of games then is a game.

Addition, negation, and comparison are all defined the same way for both surreal numbers and games.

Every surreal number is a game, but not all games are surreal numbers, e.g. the game  is not a surreal number. The class of games is more general than the surreals, and has a simpler definition, but lacks some of the nicer properties of surreal numbers. The class of surreal numbers forms a field, but the class of games does not. The surreals have a total order: given any two surreals, they are either equal, or one is greater than the other. The games have only a partial order: there exist pairs of games that are neither equal, greater than, nor less than each other. Each surreal number is either positive, negative, or zero. Each game is either positive, negative, &quot;zero&quot;, or &quot;fuzzy&quot; (incomparable with zero, such as ).

A move in a game involves the player whose move it is choosing a game from those available in (for the left player) or (for the right player) and then passing this chosen game to the other player. A player who cannot move because the choice is from the empty set has lost. A positive game represents a win for the left player, a negative game for the right player, a zero game for the second player to move, and a fuzzy game for the first player to move.

If , , and are surreals, and , then . However, if , , and are games, and , then it is not always true that . Note that &quot;&quot; here means equality, not identity.

==Application to combinatorial game theory==

The surreal numbers were originally motivated by studies of the game Go, and there are numerous connections between popular games and the surreals. In this section, we will use a capitalized &quot;Game&quot; for the mathematical object , and the lowercase &quot;game&quot; for recreational games like Chess or Go.

We consider games with these properties:
* Two players (named &quot;Left&quot; and &quot;Right&quot;)
* Deterministic (the game at each step will completely depend on the choices the players make, rather than a random factor)
* No hidden information (such as cards or tiles that a player hides)
* Players alternate taking turns (the game may or may not allow multiple moves in a turn)
* Every game must end in a finite number of moves
* As soon as there are no legal moves left for a player, the game ends, and that player loses

For most games, the initial board position gives no great advantage to either player. As the game progresses and one player starts to win, board positions will occur in which that player has a clear advantage. For analyzing games, it is useful to associate a Game with every board position. The value of a given position will be the Game , where is the set of values of all the positions that can be reached in a single move by Left. Similarly, is the set of values of all the positions that can be reached in a single move by Right.

The zero Game (called ) is the Game where and are both empty, so the player to move next ( or ) immediately loses. The sum of two Games and is defined as the Game where the player to move chooses which of the Games to play in at each stage, and the loser is still the player who ends up with no legal move. One can imagine two chess boards between two players, with players making moves alternately, but with complete freedom as to which board to play on. If is the Game , is the Game , i.e. with the role of the two players reversed. It is easy to show for all Games (where is defined as ).

This simple way to associate Games with games yields a very interesting result. Suppose two perfect players play a game starting with a given position whose associated Game is . We can classify all Games into four classes as follows:

* If then Left will win, regardless of who plays first.
* If then Right will win, regardless of who plays first.
* If then the player who goes second will win.
* If then the player who goes first will win.

More generally, we can define as , and similarly for , and .

The notation means that and are incomparable. is equivalent to , i.e. that , and are all false. Incomparable games are sometimes said to be &quot;confused&quot; with each other, because one or the other may be preferred by a player depending on what is added to it. A game confused with zero is said to be fuzzy, as opposed to positive, negative, or zero. An example of a fuzzy game is star (*).

Sometimes when a game nears the end, it will decompose into several smaller games that do not interact, except in that each player&#x27;s turn allows moving in only one of them. For example, in Go, the board will slowly fill up with pieces until there are just a few small islands of empty space where a player can move. Each island is like a separate game of Go, played on a very small board. It would be useful if each subgame could be analyzed separately, and then the results combined to give an analysis of the entire game. This doesn&#x27;t appear to be easy to do. For example, there might be two subgames where whoever moves first wins, but when they are combined into one big game, it is no longer the first player who wins. Fortunately, there is a way to do this analysis. The following theorem can be applied:

:If a big game decomposes into two smaller games, and the small games have associated Games of and , then the big game will have an associated Game of .

A game composed of smaller games is called the disjunctive sum of those smaller games, and the theorem states that the method of addition we defined is equivalent to taking the disjunctive sum of the addends.

Historically, Conway developed the theory of surreal numbers in the reverse order of how it has been presented here. He was analyzing Go endgames, and realized that it would be useful to have some way to combine the analyses of non-interacting subgames into an analysis of their disjunctive sum. From this he invented the concept of a Game and the addition operator for it. From there he moved on to developing a definition of negation and comparison. Then he noticed that a certain class of Games had interesting properties; this class became the surreal numbers. Finally, he developed the multiplication operator, and proved that the surreals are actually a field, and that it includes both the reals and ordinals.

==Alternative realizations==

Alternative approaches to the surreal numbers complement Conway&#x27;s exposition in terms of games.

===Sign expansion===

====Definitions====

In what is now called the &quot;sign-expansion&quot; or &quot;sign-sequence&quot; of a surreal number, a surreal number is a function whose domain is an ordinal and whose codomain is . This is equivalent to Conway&#x27;s L-R sequences.

Define the binary predicate &quot;simpler than&quot; on numbers by: is simpler than if is a proper subset of , i.e. if and for all .

For surreal numbers define the binary relation to be lexicographic order (with the convention that &quot;undefined values&quot; are greater than and less than ). So if one of the following holds:
* is simpler than and ;
* is simpler than and ;
* there exists a number such that is simpler than , is simpler than , and .

Equivalently, let ,
so that if and only if . Then, for numbers and , if and only if one of the following holds:
* 

For numbers and , if and only if , and if and only if . Also if and only if .

The relation is transitive, and for all numbers and , exactly one of , , , holds (law of trichotomy). This means that is a linear order (except that is a proper class).

For sets of numbers and such that , there exists a unique number such that
* For any number such that , or is simpler than .

Furthermore, is constructible from and by transfinite induction. is the simplest number between and . Let the unique number be denoted by .

For a number , define its left set and right set by
* 

then .

One advantage of this alternative realization is that equality is identity, not an inductively defined relation. Unlike Conway&#x27;s realization of the surreal numbers, however, the sign-expansion requires a prior construction of the ordinals, while in Conway&#x27;s realization, the ordinals are constructed as particular cases of surreals.

However, similar definitions can be made that eliminate the need for prior construction of the ordinals. For instance, we could let the surreals be the (recursively-defined) class of functions whose domain is a subset of the surreals satisfying the transitivity rule and whose range is . &quot;Simpler than&quot; is very simply defined now: is simpler than if . The total ordering is defined by considering and as sets of ordered pairs (as a function is normally defined): Either , or else the surreal number is in the domain of or the domain of (or both, but in this case the signs must disagree). We then have if or (or both). Converting these functions into sign sequences is a straightforward task; arrange the elements of in order of simplicity (i.e., inclusion), and then write down the signs that assigns to each of these elements in order. The ordinals then occur naturally as those surreal numbers whose range is .

====Addition and multiplication====

The sum of two numbers and is defined by induction on and by , where
* .

The additive identity is given by the number , i.e. the number is the unique function whose domain is the ordinal , and the additive inverse of the number is the number , given by , and, for , if , and if .

It follows that a number is positive if and only if and , and is negative if and only if and .

The product of two numbers, and , is defined by induction on and by , where
* 

The multiplicative identity is given by the number , i.e. the number has domain equal to the ordinal , and .

====Correspondence with Conway&#x27;s realization====

The map from Conway&#x27;s realization to sign expansions is given by , where and .

The inverse map from the alternative realization to Conway&#x27;s realization is given by , where and .

===Axiomatic approach===

In another approach to the surreals, given by Alling, explicit construction is bypassed altogether. Instead, a set of axioms is given that any particular approach to the surreals must satisfy. Much like the axiomatic approach to the reals, these axioms guarantee uniqueness up to isomorphism.

A triple formula_52 is a surreal number system if and only if the following hold:

* is a total order over formula_25
* is a function from formula_25 onto the class of all ordinals ( is called the &quot;birthday function&quot; on formula_25).
* Let and be subsets of formula_25 such that for all and , (using Alling&#x27;s terminology, is a &quot;Conway cut&quot; of formula_25). Then there exists a unique formula_58 such that is minimal and for all and all , . (This axiom is often referred to as &quot;Conway&#x27;s Simplicity Theorem&quot;.)
* Furthermore, if an ordinal is greater than for all , then . (Alling calls a system that satisfies this axiom a &quot;full surreal number system&quot;.)

Both Conway&#x27;s original construction and the sign-expansion construction of surreals satisfy these axioms.

Given these axioms, Alling derives Conway&#x27;s original definition of and develops surreal arithmetic.

===Simplicity hierarchy===

A construction of the surreal numbers as a maximal binary pseudo-tree with simplicity (ancestor) and ordering relations is due to Philip Ehrlich. The difference from the usual definition of a tree is that the set of ancestors of a vertex is well-ordered, but may not have a maximal element (immediate predecessor); in other words the order type of that set is a general ordinal number, not just a natural number. This construction fulfills Alling&#x27;s axioms as well and can easily be mapped to the sign-sequence representation. Ehrlich additionally constructed an isomorphism between Conway&#x27;s maximal surreal number field and the maximal hyperreals in von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory. 

===Hahn series===

Alling also proves that the field of surreal numbers is isomorphic (as an ordered field) to the field of Hahn series with real coefficients on the value group of surreal numbers themselves (the series representation corresponding to the normal form of a surreal number, as defined above). This provides a connection between surreal numbers and more conventional mathematical approaches to ordered field theory.

This isomorphism makes the surreal numbers into a valued field where the valuation is the additive inverse of the exponent of the leading term in the Conway normal form, e.g., . The valuation ring then consists of the finite surreal numbers (numbers with a real and/or an infinitesimal part). The reason for the sign inversion is that the exponents in the Conway normal form constitute a reverse well-ordered set, whereas Hahn series are formulated in terms of (non-reversed) well-ordered subsets of the value group.

<text>In abstract algebra, the sedenions form a 16-dimensional noncommutative and nonassociative algebra over the real numbers, usually represented by the capital letter S, boldface or blackboard bold formula_1.

The sedenions are obtained by applying the Cayley–Dickson construction to the octonions, which can be mathematically expressed as formula_2. As such, the octonions are isomorphic to a subalgebra of the sedenions. Unlike the octonions, the sedenions are not an alternative algebra. Applying the Cayley–Dickson construction to the sedenions yields a 32-dimensional algebra, called the trigintaduonions or sometimes the 32-nions.

The term &quot;sedenion&quot; is also used for other 16-dimensional algebraic structures, such as a tensor product of two copies of the biquaternions, or the algebra of 4 × 4 matrices over the real numbers, or that studied by .

== Arithmetic ==
Every sedenion is a linear combination of the unit sedenions formula_3, formula_4, formula_5, formula_6, ..., formula_7,
which form a basis of the vector space of sedenions. Every sedenion can be represented in the form

:formula_8

Addition and subtraction are defined by the addition and subtraction of corresponding coefficients and multiplication is distributive over addition.

Like other algebras based on the Cayley–Dickson construction, the sedenions contain the algebra they were constructed from. So they contain the octonions (generated by formula_3 to formula_10 in the table below), and therefore also the quaternions (generated by formula_3 to formula_6), complex numbers (generated by formula_3 and formula_4) and real numbers (generated by formula_3).

=== Multiplication ===
Like octonions, multiplication of sedenions is neither commutative nor associative. However, in contrast to the octonions, the sedenions do not even have the property of being alternative. They do, however, have the property of power associativity, which can be stated as that, for any element formula_16 of formula_17, the power formula_18 is well defined. They are also flexible.

The sedenions have a multiplicative identity element formula_3 and multiplicative inverses, but they are not a division algebra because they have zero divisors: two nonzero sedenions can be multiplied to obtain zero, for example formula_20. All hypercomplex number systems after sedenions that are based on the Cayley–Dickson construction also contain zero divisors.

The sedenion multiplication table is shown below:

The sedenions are not fully anti-associative. Choose any four generators, formula_24 and formula_25. The following 5-cycle shows that these five relations cannot all be anti-associative.

In particular, in the table above, using formula_27 and formula_28 the last expression associates.

=== Quaternionic subalgebras ===
The particular sedenion multiplication table shown above is represented by 35 triads. The table and its triads have been constructed from an octonion represented by the bolded set of 7 triads using Cayley–Dickson construction. It is one of 480 possible sets of 7 triads (one of two shown in the octonion article) and is the one based on the Cayley–Dickson construction of quaternions from two possible quaternion constructions from the complex numbers. The binary representations of the indices of these triples bitwise XOR to 0. These 35 triads are:

{ {1, 2, 3}, {1, 4, 5}, {1, 7, 6}, {1, 8, 9}, {1, 11, 10}, {1, 13, 12}, {1, 14, 15}, 
{2, 4, 6}, {2, 5, 7}, {2, 8, 10}, {2, 9, 11}, {2, 14, 12}, {2, 15, 13}, {3, 4, 7}, 
{3, 6, 5}, {3, 8, 11}, {3, 10, 9}, {3, 13, 14}, {3, 15, 12}, {4, 8, 12}, {4, 9, 13}, 
{4, 10, 14}, {4, 11, 15}, {5, 8, 13}, {5, 10, 15}, {5, 12, 9}, {5, 14, 11}, {6, 8, 14}, 
{6, 11, 13}, {6, 12, 10}, {6, 15, 9}, {7, 8, 15}, {7, 9, 14}, {7, 12, 11}, {7, 13, 10} }

== Applications ==
 showed that the space of pairs of norm-one sedenions that multiply to zero is homeomorphic to the compact form of the exceptional Lie group G2. (Note that in his paper, a &quot;zero divisor&quot; means a &quot;pair&quot; of elements that multiply to zero.)

 demonstrated that the three generations of leptons and quarks that are associated with unbroken gauge symmetry formula_33 can be represented using the algebra of the complexified sedenions formula_34. Their reasoning follows that a primitive idempotent projector formula_35 — where formula_7 is chosen as an imaginary unit akin to formula_37 for formula_38 in the Fano plane — that acts on the standard basis of the sedenions uniquely divides the algebra into three sets of split basis elements for formula_39, whose adjoint left actions &quot;on themselves&quot; generate three copies of the Clifford algebra formula_40 which in-turn contain minimal left ideals that describe a single generation of fermions with unbroken formula_33 gauge symmetry. In particular, they note that tensor products between normed division algebras generate zero divisors akin to those inside formula_42, where for formula_39 the lack of alternativity and associativity does not affect the construction of minimal left ideals since their underlying split basis requires only two basis elements to be multiplied together, in-which associativity or alternativity are uninvolved. Still, these ideals constructed from an adjoint algebra of left actions of the algebra on itself remain associative, alternative, and isomorphic to a Clifford algebra. Altogether, this permits three copies of formula_44 to exist inside formula_45. Furthermore, these three complexified octonion subalgebras are not independent; they share a common formula_46 subalgebra, which the authors note could form a theoretical basis for CKM and PMNS matrices that, respectively, describe quark mixing and neutrino oscillations.

Sedenion neural networks provide a means of efficient and compact expression in machine learning applications and have been used in solving multiple time-series and traffic forecasting problems.

<text>In mathematics, the octonions are a normed division algebra over the real numbers, a kind of hypercomplex number system. The octonions are usually represented by the capital letter O, using boldface or blackboard bold formula_1. Octonions have eight dimensions; twice the number of dimensions of the quaternions, of which they are an extension. They are noncommutative and nonassociative, but satisfy a weaker form of associativity; namely, they are alternative. They are also power associative.

Octonions are not as well known as the quaternions and complex numbers, which are much more widely studied and used. Octonions are related to exceptional structures in mathematics, among them the exceptional Lie groups. Octonions have applications in fields such as string theory, special relativity and quantum logic. Applying the Cayley–Dickson construction to the octonions produces the sedenions.

== History ==
The octonions were discovered in December 1843 by John T. Graves, inspired by his friend William Rowan Hamilton&#x27;s discovery of quaternions. Shortly before Graves&#x27; discovery of octonions, Graves wrote in a letter addressed to Hamilton on October 26, 1843, &quot;If with your alchemy you can make three pounds of gold, why should you stop there?&quot;

Graves called his discovery &quot;octaves&quot;, and mentioned them in a letter to Hamilton dated 26 December 1843. He first published his result slightly later than Arthur Cayley&#x27;s article. The octonions were discovered independently by Cayley and are sometimes referred to as Cayley numbers or the Cayley algebra. Hamilton described the early history of Graves&#x27;s discovery.

==Definition==
The octonions can be thought of as octets (or 8-tuples) of real numbers. Every octonion is a real linear combination of the unit octonions:

:formula_2

where is the scalar or real element; it may be identified with the real number That is, every octonion can be written in the form
:formula_3
with real coefficients .

===Cayley–Dickson construction===

A more systematic way of defining the octonions is via the Cayley–Dickson construction. Applying the Cayley–Dickson construction to the quaternions produces the octonions, which can be expressed as formula_4.

Much as quaternions can be defined as pairs of complex numbers, the octonions can be defined as pairs of quaternions. Addition is defined pairwise. The product of two pairs of quaternions and is defined by
:formula_5
where denotes the conjugate of the quaternion . This definition is equivalent to the one given above when the eight unit octonions are identified with the pairs

==Arithmetic and operations==
===Addition and subtraction===
Addition and subtraction of octonions is done by adding and subtracting corresponding terms and hence their coefficients, like quaternions.

===Multiplication===
Multiplication of octonions is more complex. Multiplication is distributive over addition, so the product of two octonions can be calculated by summing the products of all the terms, again like quaternions. The product of each pair of terms can be given by multiplication of the coefficients and a multiplication table of the unit octonions, like this one (given both by Arthur Cayley in 1845 and John T. Graves in 1843):

Most off-diagonal elements of the table are antisymmetric, making it almost a skew-symmetric matrix except for the elements on the main diagonal, as well as the row and column for which is an operand.

The table can be summarized as follows:

: formula_6

where is the Kronecker delta (equal to if , and for ), and is a completely antisymmetric tensor with value when and any even number of permutations of the indices, but for any odd permutations of the listed triples (e.g. formula_7 but formula_8 however, formula_9 again). Whenever any two of the three indices are the same, 

The above definition is not unique, however; it is only one of 480 possible definitions for octonion multiplication with . The others can be obtained by permuting and changing the signs of the non-scalar basis elements The 480 different algebras are isomorphic, and there is rarely a need to consider which particular multiplication rule is used.

Each of these 480 definitions is invariant up to signs under some 7 cycle of the points and for each 7 cycle there are four definitions, differing by signs and reversal of order. A common choice is to use the definition invariant under the 7 cycle (1234567) with by using the triangular multiplication diagram, or Fano plane below that also shows the sorted list of based 7-cycle triads and its associated multiplication matrices in both and formula_10 format. 

A variant of this sometimes used is to label the elements of the basis by the elements , 0, 1, 2, ..., 6, of the projective line over the finite field of order 7. The multiplication is then given by and , and all equations obtained from this one by adding a constant (modulo 7) to all subscripts: In other words using the seven triples These are the nonzero codewords of the quadratic residue code of length 7 over the Galois field of two elements, . There is a symmetry of order 7 given by adding a constant mod 7 to all subscripts, and also a symmetry of order 3 given by multiplying all subscripts by one of the quadratic residues 1, 2, 4 mod 7 .
These seven triples can also be considered as the seven translates of the set {1,2,4} of non-zero squares 
forming a cyclic (7,3,1)-difference set in the finite field of seven elements. 

The Fano plane shown above with formula_11 and IJKL multiplication matrices also includes the geometric algebra basis with signature and is given in terms of the following 7 quaternionic triples (omitting the scalar identity element):

or alternatively:

in which the lower case items &quot;{i, j, k, l}&quot; are vectors (e.g. {formula_12}, respectively) and the upper case ones {&quot;I,J,K&quot;}={&quot;σ1,σ2,σ3&quot;} are bivectors (e.g. formula_13, respectively) and the Hodge star operator is the pseudo-scalar element. If the is forced to be equal to the identity, then the multiplication ceases to be associative, but the may be removed from the multiplication table resulting in an octonion multiplication table.

In keeping associative and thus not reducing the 4 dimensional geometric algebra to an octonion one, the whole multiplication table can be derived from the equation for . Consider the gamma matrices in the examples given above. The formula defining the fifth gamma matrix (formula_14) shows that it is the of a four-dimensional geometric algebra of the gamma matrices.

===Fano plane mnemonic===
A convenient mnemonic for remembering the products of unit octonions is given by the diagram, which represents the multiplication table of Cayley and Graves.
This diagram with seven points and seven lines (the circle through 1, 2, and 3 is considered a line) is called the Fano plane. The lines are directional. The seven points correspond to the seven standard basis elements of formula_15 (see definition below). Each pair of distinct points lies on a unique line and each line runs through exactly three points.

Let be an ordered triple of points lying on a given line with the order specified by the direction of the arrow. Then multiplication is given by

: and 

together with cyclic permutations. These rules together with

* is the multiplicative identity,
* formula_16 for each point in the diagram

completely defines the multiplicative structure of the octonions. Each of the seven lines generates a subalgebra of formula_17 isomorphic to the quaternions .

===Conjugate, norm, and inverse===
The &quot;conjugate&quot; of an octonion

:formula_18

is given by

:formula_19
Conjugation is an involution of formula_17 and satisfies (note the change in order).

The &quot;real part&quot; of is given by

:formula_21

and the &quot;imaginary part&quot; (sometimes called the &quot;pure part&quot;) by

:formula_22

The set of all purely imaginary octonions spans a 7 dimensional subspace of formula_23 denoted formula_24

Conjugation of octonions satisfies the equation

:formula_25

The product of an octonion with its conjugate, is always a nonnegative real number:

:formula_26

Using this, the norm of an octonion is defined as

:formula_27

This norm agrees with the standard 8 dimensional Euclidean norm on .

The existence of a norm on formula_17 implies the existence of inverses for every nonzero element of formula_29 The inverse of which is the unique octonion satisfying is given by

:formula_30

===Exponentiation and polar form===
Any octonion can be decomposed into its real part and imaginary part:

formula_31

also sometimes called scalar and vector parts.

We define the &quot;unit vector&quot; corresponding to as

formula_32. It is a pure octonion of norm 1.

It can be proved that any non-zero octonion can be written as:

formula_33

thus providing a polar form.

==Properties==
Octonionic multiplication is neither commutative:

: if , are distinct and non-zero,

nor associative:

: if , , are distinct, non-zero and .

The octonions do satisfy a weaker form of associativity: they are alternative. This means that the subalgebra generated by any two elements is associative. Actually, one can show that the subalgebra generated by any two elements of formula_17 is isomorphic to , , or , all of which are associative. Because of their non-associativity, octonions cannot be represented by a subalgebra of a matrix ring over , unlike the real numbers, complex numbers, and quaternions.

The octonions do retain one important property shared by , , and : the norm on formula_17 satisfies

:formula_36

This equation means that the octonions form a composition algebra. The higher-dimensional algebras defined by the Cayley–Dickson construction (starting with the sedenions) all fail to satisfy this property. They all have zero divisors.

Wider number systems exist which have a multiplicative modulus (for example, 16 dimensional conic sedenions). Their modulus is defined differently from their norm, and they also contain zero divisors.

As shown by Hurwitz, , , or , and formula_17 are the only normed division algebras over the real numbers. These four algebras also form the only alternative, finite-dimensional division algebras over the real numbers (up to an isomorphism).

Not being associative, the nonzero elements of formula_17 do not form a group. They do, however, form a loop, specifically a Moufang loop.

===Commutator and cross product===
The commutator of two octonions and is given by

:formula_39

This is antisymmetric and imaginary. If it is considered only as a product on the imaginary subspace formula_15 it defines a product on that space, the seven-dimensional cross product, given by

:formula_41

Like the cross product in three dimensions this is a vector orthogonal to and with magnitude

:formula_42

But like the octonion product it is not uniquely defined. Instead there are many different cross products, each one dependent on the choice of octonion product.

===Automorphisms===
An automorphism, , of the octonions is an invertible linear transformation of formula_17 which satisfies

:formula_44

The set of all automorphisms of formula_17 forms a group called The group is a simply connected, compact, real Lie group of dimension 14. This group is the smallest of the exceptional Lie groups and is isomorphic to the subgroup of that preserves any chosen particular vector in its 8 dimensional real spinor representation. The group is in turn a subgroup of the group of isotopies described below.

&quot;See also&quot;: – the automorphism group of the Fano plane.

===Isotopies===
An isotopy of an algebra is a triple of bijective linear maps , , such that if then . For this is the same as an automorphism. The isotopy group of an algebra is the group of all isotopies, which contains the group of automorphisms as a subgroup.

The isotopy group of the octonions is the group , with , , acting as the three 8 dimensional representations. The subgroup of elements where fixes the identity is the subgroup , and the subgroup where , , all fix the identity is the automorphism group 

===Matrix representation===
Just as quaternions can be represented as matrices, octonions can be represented as tables of quaternions. Specifically, because any octonion can be defined a pair of quaternions, we represent the octonion formula_46 as:
formula_47

Using a slightly modified (non-associative) quaternionic matrix multiplication:
formula_48
we can translate octonion addition and multiplication to the respective operations on quaternionic matrices.

==Applications==
The octonions play a significant role in the classification and construction of other mathematical entities. For example, the exceptional Lie group is the automorphism group of the octonions, and the other exceptional Lie groups , , and can be understood as the isometries of certain projective planes defined using the octonions. The set of self-adjoint 3 × 3 octonionic matrices, equipped with a symmetrized matrix product, defines the Albert algebra. In discrete mathematics, the octonions provide an elementary derivation of the Leech lattice, and thus they are closely related to the sporadic simple groups.

Applications of the octonions to physics have largely been conjectural. For example, in the 1970s, attempts were made to understand quarks by way of an octonionic Hilbert space. It is known that the octonions, and the fact that only four normed division algebras can exist, relates to the spacetime dimensions in which supersymmetric quantum field theories can be constructed. Also, attempts have been made to obtain the Standard Model of elementary particle physics from octonionic constructions, for example using the &quot;Dixon algebra&quot; formula_49

Octonions have also arisen in the study of black hole entropy, quantum information science, string theory, and image processing.

Octonions have been used in solutions to the hand eye calibration problem in robotics.

Deep octonion networks provide a means of efficient and compact expression in machine learning applications.

==Integral octonions==
There are several natural ways to choose an integral form of the octonions. The simplest is just to take the octonions whose coordinates are integers. This gives a nonassociative algebra over the integers called the Gravesian octonions. However it is not a maximal order (in the sense of ring theory); there are exactly seven maximal orders containing it. These seven maximal orders are all equivalent under automorphisms. The phrase &quot;integral octonions&quot; usually refers to a fixed choice of one of these seven orders.

These maximal orders were constructed by , Dickson and Bruck as follows. Label the eight basis vectors by the points of the projective line over the field with seven elements. First form the &quot;Kirmse integers&quot; : these consist of octonions whose coordinates are integers or half integers, and that are half integers (that is, halves of odd integers) on one of the 16 sets
of the extended quadratic residue code of length 8 over the field of two elements, given by , and its images under adding a constant modulo 7, and the complements of these eight sets. Then switch infinity and any one other coordinate; this operation creates a bijection of the Kirmse integers onto a different set, which is a maximal order. There are seven ways to do this, giving seven maximal orders, which are all equivalent under cyclic permutations of the seven coordinates 0123456. (Kirmse incorrectly claimed that the Kirmse integers also form a maximal order, so he thought there were eight maximal orders rather than seven, but as pointed out they are not closed under multiplication; this mistake occurs in several published papers.)

The Kirmse integers and the seven maximal orders are all isometric to the lattice rescaled by a factor of . In particular there are 240 elements of minimum nonzero norm 1 in each of these orders, forming a Moufang loop of order 240.

The integral octonions have a &quot;division with remainder&quot; property: given integral octonions and , we can find and with , where the remainder has norm less than that of .

In the integral octonions, all left ideals and right ideals are 2-sided ideals, and the only 2-sided ideals are the principal ideals where is a non-negative integer.

The integral octonions have a version of factorization into primes, though it is not straightforward to state because the octonions are not associative so the product of octonions depends on the order in which one does the products. The irreducible integral octonions are exactly those of prime norm, and every integral octonion can be written as a product of irreducible octonions. More precisely an integral octonion of norm can be written as a product of integral octonions of norms and .

The automorphism group of the integral octonions is the group of order 12,096, which has a simple subgroup of index 2 isomorphic to the unitary group . The isotopy group of the integral octonions is the perfect double cover of the group of rotations of the lattice.

<text>In mathematics, hypercomplex number is a traditional term for an element of a finite-dimensional unital algebra over the field of real numbers. 
The study of hypercomplex numbers in the late 19th century forms the basis of modern group representation theory.

== History ==
In the nineteenth century, number systems called quaternions, tessarines, coquaternions, biquaternions, and octonions became established concepts in mathematical literature, added to the real and complex numbers. The concept of a hypercomplex number covered them all, and called for a discipline to explain and classify them.

The cataloguing project began in 1872 when Benjamin Peirce first published his &quot;Linear Associative Algebra&quot;, and was carried forward by his son Charles Sanders Peirce. Most significantly, they identified the nilpotent and the idempotent elements as useful hypercomplex numbers for classifications. The Cayley–Dickson construction used involutions to generate complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions out of the real number system. Hurwitz and Frobenius proved theorems that put limits on hypercomplexity: Hurwitz&#x27;s theorem says finite-dimensional real composition algebras are the reals formula_1, the complexes formula_2, the quaternions formula_3, and the octonions formula_4, and the Frobenius theorem says the only real associative division algebras are formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3. In 1958 J. Frank Adams published a further generalization in terms of Hopf invariants on &quot;H&quot;-spaces which still limits the dimension to 1, 2, 4, or 8.

It was matrix algebra that harnessed the hypercomplex systems. For instance, 2 x 2 real matrices were found isomorphic to coquaternions. Soon the matrix paradigm began to explain several others as they were represented by matrices and their operations. In 1907 Joseph Wedderburn showed that associative hypercomplex systems could be represented by square matrices, or direct products of algebras of square matrices. From that date the preferred term for a &quot;hypercomplex system&quot; became &quot;associative algebra&quot;, as seen in the title of Wedderburn&#x27;s thesis at University of Edinburgh. Note however, that non-associative systems like octonions and hyperbolic quaternions represent another type of hypercomplex number.

As Thomas Hawkins explains, the hypercomplex numbers are stepping stones to learning about Lie groups and group representation theory. For instance, in 1929 Emmy Noether wrote on &quot;hypercomplex quantities and representation theory&quot;. In 1973 Kantor and Solodovnikov published a textbook on hypercomplex numbers which was translated in 1989.

Karen Parshall has written a detailed exposition of the heyday of hypercomplex numbers, including the role of mathematicians including Theodor Molien and Eduard Study. For the transition to modern algebra, Bartel van der Waerden devotes thirty pages to hypercomplex numbers in his &quot;History of Algebra&quot;.

== Definition ==
A definition of a hypercomplex number is given by as an element of a unital, but not necessarily associative or commutative, finite-dimensional algebra over the real numbers. Elements are generated with real number coefficients formula_8 for a basis formula_9. Where possible, it is conventional to choose the basis so that formula_10. A technical approach to hypercomplex numbers directs attention first to those of dimension two.

== Two-dimensional real algebras ==
Theorem: Up to isomorphism, there are exactly three 2-dimensional unital algebras over the reals: the ordinary complex numbers, the split-complex numbers, and the dual numbers. In particular, every 2-dimensional unital algebra over the reals is associative and commutative.

Proof: Since the algebra is 2-dimensional, we can pick a basis . Since the algebra is closed under squaring, the non-real basis element &quot;u&quot; squares to a linear combination of 1 and &quot;u&quot;:
: formula_11
for some real numbers &quot;a&quot;0 and &quot;a&quot;1.

Using the common method of completing the square by subtracting &quot;a&quot;1&quot;u&quot; and adding the quadratic complement &quot;a&quot;/4 to both sides yields
: formula_12

Thus formula_13 where formula_14
The three cases depend on this real value:
* If , the above formula yields . Hence, &quot;ũ&quot; can directly be identified with the nilpotent element formula_15 of the basis formula_16 of the dual numbers.
* If , the above formula yields . This leads to the split-complex numbers which have normalized basis formula_17 with formula_18. To obtain &quot;j&quot; from &quot;ũ&quot;, the latter must be divided by the positive real number formula_19 which has the same square as &quot;ũ&quot; has.
* If , the above formula yields . This leads to the complex numbers which have normalized basis formula_20 with formula_21. To yield &quot;i&quot; from &quot;ũ&quot;, the latter has to be divided by a positive real number formula_22 which squares to the negative of &quot;ũ&quot;2.

The complex numbers are the only 2-dimensional hypercomplex algebra that is a field.
Split algebras such as the split-complex numbers that include non-real roots of 1 also contain idempotents formula_23 and zero divisors formula_24, so such algebras cannot be division algebras. However, these properties can turn out to be very meaningful, for instance in representing a light cone with a null cone.

In a 2004 edition of &quot;Mathematics Magazine&quot; the 2-dimensional real algebras have been styled the &quot;generalized complex numbers&quot;. The idea of cross-ratio of four complex numbers can be extended to the 2-dimensional real algebras.

== Higher-dimensional examples (more than one non-real axis) ==

=== Clifford algebras ===
A Clifford algebra is the unital associative algebra generated over an underlying vector space equipped with a quadratic form. Over the real numbers this is equivalent to being able to define a symmetric scalar product, that can be used to orthogonalise the quadratic form, to give a basis such that:
formula_25

Imposing closure under multiplication generates a multivector space spanned by a basis of 2&quot;k&quot; elements, . These can be interpreted as the basis of a hypercomplex number system. Unlike the basis , the remaining basis elements need not anti-commute, depending on how many simple exchanges must be carried out to swap the two factors. So , but .

Putting aside the bases which contain an element &quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot; such that (i.e. directions in the original space over which the quadratic form was degenerate), the remaining Clifford algebras can be identified by the label Cl&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;(formula_1), indicating that the algebra is constructed from &quot;p&quot; simple basis elements with , &quot;q&quot; with , and where formula_1 indicates that this is to be a Clifford algebra over the reals—i.e. coefficients of elements of the algebra are to be real numbers.

These algebras, called geometric algebras, form a systematic set, which turn out to be very useful in physics problems which involve rotations, phases, or spins, notably in classical and quantum mechanics, electromagnetic theory and relativity.

Examples include: the complex numbers Cl0,1(formula_1), split-complex numbers Cl1,0(formula_1), quaternions Cl0,2(formula_1), split-biquaternions Cl0,3(formula_1), split-quaternions (the natural algebra of two-dimensional space); Cl3,0(formula_1) (the natural algebra of three-dimensional space, and the algebra of the Pauli matrices); and the spacetime algebra Cl1,3(formula_1).

The elements of the algebra Cl&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;(formula_1) form an even subalgebra Cl(formula_1) of the algebra Cl&quot;q&quot;+1,&quot;p&quot;(formula_1), which can be used to parametrise rotations in the larger algebra. There is thus a close connection between complex numbers and rotations in two-dimensional space; between quaternions and rotations in three-dimensional space; between split-complex numbers and (hyperbolic) rotations (Lorentz transformations) in 1+1-dimensional space, and so on.

Whereas Cayley–Dickson and split-complex constructs with eight or more dimensions are not associative with respect to multiplication, Clifford algebras retain associativity at any number of dimensions.

In 1995 Ian R. Porteous wrote on &quot;The recognition of subalgebras&quot; in his book on Clifford algebras. His Proposition 11.4 summarizes the hypercomplex cases:
: Let &quot;A&quot; be a real associative algebra with unit element 1. Then
:* 1 generates formula_1 (algebra of real numbers),
:* any two-dimensional subalgebra generated by an element &quot;e&quot;0 of &quot;A&quot; such that is isomorphic to formula_2 (algebra of complex numbers),
:* any two-dimensional subalgebra generated by an element &quot;e&quot;0 of &quot;A&quot; such that is isomorphic to formula_12 (pairs of real numbers with component-wise product, isomorphic to the algebra of split-complex numbers),
:* any four-dimensional subalgebra generated by a set of mutually anti-commuting elements of &quot;A&quot; such that formula_40 is isomorphic to formula_3 (algebra of quaternions),
:* any four-dimensional subalgebra generated by a set of mutually anti-commuting elements of &quot;A&quot; such that formula_42 is isomorphic to M2(formula_1) (2 × 2 real matrices, coquaternions),
:* any eight-dimensional subalgebra generated by a set of mutually anti-commuting elements of &quot;A&quot; such that formula_44 is isomorphic to 2formula_3 (split-biquaternions),
:* any eight-dimensional subalgebra generated by a set of mutually anti-commuting elements of &quot;A&quot; such that formula_46 is isomorphic to M2(formula_2) ( complex matrices, biquaternions, Pauli algebra).

=== Cayley–Dickson construction ===
All of the Clifford algebras Cl&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;(formula_1) apart from the real numbers, complex numbers and the quaternions contain non-real elements that square to +1; and so cannot be division algebras. A different approach to extending the complex numbers is taken by the Cayley–Dickson construction. This generates number systems of dimension 2&quot;n&quot;, &quot;n&quot; = 2, 3, 4, ..., with bases formula_49, where all the non-real basis elements anti-commute and satisfy formula_50. In 8 or more dimensions () these algebras are non-associative. In 16 or more dimensions () these algebras also have zero-divisors.

The first algebras in this sequence include the 4-dimensional quaternions, 8-dimensional octonions, and 16-dimensional sedenions. An algebraic symmetry is lost with each increase in dimensionality: quaternion multiplication is not commutative, octonion multiplication is non-associative, and the norm of sedenions is not multiplicative. After the sedenions are the 32-dimensional trigintaduonions (or 32-nions), the 64-dimensional sexagintaquatronions (or 64-nions), the 128-dimensional centumduodetrigintanions (or 128-nions), the 256-dimensional ducentiquinquagintasexions (or 256-nions), and &quot;ad infinitum&quot;, as summarized in the table below.

The Cayley–Dickson construction can be modified by inserting an extra sign at some stages. It then generates the &quot;split algebras&quot; in the collection of composition algebras instead of the division algebras:
: split-complex numbers with basis formula_51 satisfying formula_52,
: split-quaternions with basis formula_53 satisfying formula_54, and
: split-octonions with basis formula_55 satisfying formula_56, formula_57

Unlike the complex numbers, the split-complex numbers are not algebraically closed, and further contain nontrivial zero divisors and nontrivial idempotents. As with the quaternions, split-quaternions are not commutative, but further contain nilpotents; they are isomorphic to the square matrices of dimension two. Split-octonions are non-associative and contain nilpotents.

=== Tensor products ===
The tensor product of any two algebras is another algebra, which can be used to produce many more examples of hypercomplex number systems.

In particular taking tensor products with the complex numbers (considered as algebras over the reals) leads to four-dimensional bicomplex numbers formula_58 (isomorphic to tessarines formula_59), eight-dimensional biquaternions formula_60, and 16-dimensional complex octonions formula_61.

<text>In mathematics, the quaternion number system extends the complex numbers. Quaternions were first described by the Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton in 1843 and applied to mechanics in three-dimensional space. The algebra of quaternions is often denoted by (for &quot;Hamilton&quot;), or in blackboard bold by formula_1 Quaternions are not a field, because multiplication of quaternions is not, in general, commutative. Quaternions provide a definition of the quotient of two vectors in a three-dimensional space. Quaternions are generally represented in the form

formula_2

where the coefficients , , , are real numbers, and , are the &quot;basis vectors&quot; or &quot;basis elements&quot;.

Quaternions are used in pure mathematics, but also have practical uses in applied mathematics, particularly for calculations involving three-dimensional rotations, such as in three-dimensional computer graphics, computer vision, robotics, magnetic resonance imaging and crystallographic texture analysis. They can be used alongside other methods of rotation, such as Euler angles and rotation matrices, or as an alternative to them, depending on the application.

In modern terms, quaternions form a four-dimensional associative normed division algebra over the real numbers, and therefore a ring, also a division ring and a domain. It is a special case of a Clifford algebra, classified as formula_3 It was the first noncommutative division algebra to be discovered.

According to the Frobenius theorem, the algebra formula_4 is one of only two finite-dimensional division rings containing a proper subring isomorphic to the real numbers; the other being the complex numbers. These rings are also Euclidean Hurwitz algebras, of which the quaternions are the largest associative algebra (and hence the largest ring). Further extending the quaternions yields the non-associative octonions, which is the last normed division algebra over the real numbers. The next extension gives the sedenions, which have zero divisors and so cannot be a normed division algebra.

The unit quaternions give a group structure on the 3-sphere isomorphic to the groups Spin(3) and SU(2), i.e. the universal cover group of SO(3). The positive and negative basis vectors form the eight-element quaternion group.

== History ==

Quaternions were introduced by Hamilton in 1843. Important precursors to this work included Euler&#x27;s four-square identity (1748) and Olinde Rodrigues&#x27; parameterization of general rotations by four parameters (1840), but neither of these writers treated the four-parameter rotations as an algebra. Carl Friedrich Gauss had discovered quaternions in 1819, but this work was not published until 1900.

Hamilton knew that the complex numbers could be interpreted as points in a plane, and he was looking for a way to do the same for points in three-dimensional space. Points in space can be represented by their coordinates, which are triples of numbers, and for many years he had known how to add and subtract triples of numbers. However, for a long time, he had been stuck on the problem of multiplication and division. He could not figure out how to calculate the quotient of the coordinates of two points in space. In fact, Ferdinand Georg Frobenius later proved in 1877 that for a division algebra over the real numbers to be finite-dimensional and associative, it cannot be three-dimensional, and there are only three such division algebras: formula_5 (complex numbers) and formula_4 (quaternions) which have dimension 1, 2, and 4 respectively.

The great breakthrough in quaternions finally came on Monday 16 October 1843 in Dublin, when Hamilton was on his way to the Royal Irish Academy to preside at a council meeting. As he walked along the towpath of the Royal Canal with his wife, the concepts behind quaternions were taking shape in his mind. When the answer dawned on him, Hamilton could not resist the urge to carve the formula for the quaternions,

formula_7

into the stone of Brougham Bridge as he paused on it. Although the carving has since faded away, there has been an annual pilgrimage since 1989 called the Hamilton Walk for scientists and mathematicians who walk from Dunsink Observatory to the Royal Canal bridge in remembrance of Hamilton&#x27;s discovery.

On the following day, Hamilton wrote a letter to his friend and fellow mathematician, John T. Graves, describing the train of thought that led to his discovery. This letter was later published in a letter to the &quot;London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science&quot;; Hamilton states:
Hamilton called a quadruple with these rules of multiplication a &quot;quaternion&quot;, and he devoted most of the remainder of his life to studying and teaching them. Hamilton&#x27;s treatment is more geometric than the modern approach, which emphasizes quaternions&#x27; algebraic properties. He founded a school of &quot;quaternionists&quot;, and he tried to popularize quaternions in several books. The last and longest of his books, &quot;Elements of Quaternions&quot;, was 800 pages long; it was edited by his son and published shortly after his death.

After Hamilton&#x27;s death, the Scottish mathematical physicist Peter Tait became the chief exponent of quaternions. At this time, quaternions were a mandatory examination topic in Dublin. Topics in physics and geometry that would now be described using vectors, such as kinematics in space and Maxwell&#x27;s equations, were described entirely in terms of quaternions. There was even a professional research association, the Quaternion Society, devoted to the study of quaternions and other hypercomplex number systems.

From the mid-1880s, quaternions began to be displaced by vector analysis, which had been developed by Josiah Willard Gibbs, Oliver Heaviside, and Hermann von Helmholtz. Vector analysis described the same phenomena as quaternions, so it borrowed some ideas and terminology liberally from the literature on quaternions. However, vector analysis was conceptually simpler and notationally cleaner, and eventually quaternions were relegated to a minor role in mathematics and physics. A side-effect of this transition is that Hamilton&#x27;s work is difficult to comprehend for many modern readers. Hamilton&#x27;s original definitions are unfamiliar and his writing style was wordy and difficult to follow.

However, quaternions have had a revival since the late 20th century, primarily due to their utility in describing spatial rotations. The representations of rotations by quaternions are more compact and quicker to compute than the representations by matrices. In addition, unlike Euler angles, they are not susceptible to &quot;gimbal lock&quot;. For this reason, quaternions are used in computer graphics, computer vision, robotics, nuclear magnetic resonance image sampling, control theory, signal processing, attitude control, physics, bioinformatics, molecular dynamics, computer simulations, and orbital mechanics. For example, it is common for the attitude control systems of spacecraft to be commanded in terms of quaternions. Quaternions have received another boost from number theory because of their relationships with the quadratic forms.

=== Quaternions in physics ===

The finding of 1924 that in quantum mechanics the spin of an electron and other matter particles (known as spinors) can be described using quaternions (in the form of the famous Pauli spin matrices) furthered their interest; quaternions helped to understand how rotations of electrons by 360° can be discerned from those by 720° (the &quot;Plate trick&quot;). , their use has not overtaken rotation groups.

== Definition ==
A &quot;quaternion&quot; is an expression of the form

formula_8

where , , , , are real numbers, and , , , are symbols that can be interpreted as unit-vectors pointing along the three spatial axes. In practice, if one of , , , is 0, the corresponding term is omitted; if , , , are all zero, the quaternion is the &quot;zero quaternion&quot;, denoted 0; if one of , , equals 1, the corresponding term is written simply , or .

Hamilton describes a quaternion formula_9, as consisting of a scalar part and a vector part. The quaternion formula_10 is called the &quot;vector part&quot; (sometimes &quot;imaginary part&quot;) of , and is the &quot;scalar part&quot; (sometimes &quot;real part&quot;) of . A quaternion that equals its real part (that is, its vector part is zero) is called a &quot;scalar&quot; or &quot;real quaternion&quot;, and is identified with the corresponding real number. That is, the real numbers are &quot;embedded&quot; in the quaternions. (More properly, the field of real numbers is isomorphic to a subset of the quaternions. The field of complex numbers is also isomorphic to three subsets of quaternions.) A quaternion that equals its vector part is called a &quot;vector quaternion&quot;.

The set of quaternions is a 4-dimensional vector space over the real numbers, with formula_11 as a basis, by the component-wise addition

formula_12

and the component-wise scalar multiplication

formula_13

A multiplicative group structure, called the &quot;Hamilton product&quot;, denoted by juxtaposition, can be defined on the quaternions in the following way:
*The real quaternion is the identity element.
*The real quaternions commute with all other quaternions, that is for every quaternion and every real quaternion . In algebraic terminology this is to say that the field of real quaternions are the &quot;center&quot; of this quaternion algebra.
*The product is first given for the basis elements (see next subsection), and then extended to all quaternions by using the distributive property and the center property of the real quaternions. The Hamilton product is not commutative, but is associative, thus the quaternions form an associative algebra over the real numbers.
*Additionally, every nonzero quaternion has an inverse with respect to the Hamilton product: formula_14
Thus the quaternions form a division algebra.

=== Multiplication of basis elements ===

The multiplication with of the basis elements , and is defined by the fact that is a multiplicative identity, that is,

formula_15

The products of other basis elements are

formula_16

Combining these rules,

formula_17

=== Center ===
The &quot;center&quot; of a noncommutative ring is the subring of elements such that for every . The center of the quaternion algebra is the subfield of real quaternions. In fact, it is a part of the definition that the real quaternions belong to the center. Conversely, if belongs to the center, then

formula_18

and . A similar computation with instead of shows that one has also . Thus is a &quot;real&quot; quaternion.

The quaternions form a division algebra. This means that the non-commutativity of multiplication is the only property that makes quaternions different from a field. This non-commutativity has some unexpected consequences, among them that a polynomial equation over the quaternions can have more distinct solutions than the degree of the polynomial. For example, the equation has infinitely many quaternion solutions, which are the quaternions such that . Thus these &quot;roots of –1&quot; form a unit sphere in the three-dimensional space of vector quaternions.

=== Hamilton product ===
For two elements and , their product, called the Hamilton product () (), is determined by the products of the basis elements and the distributive law. The distributive law makes it possible to expand the product so that it is a sum of products of basis elements. This gives the following expression:

formula_19

Now the basis elements can be multiplied using the rules given above to get:

formula_20

=== Scalar and vector parts ===
A quaternion of the form , where is a real number, is called scalar, and a quaternion of the form , where , , and are real numbers, and at least one of , , or is nonzero, is called a vector quaternion. If is any quaternion, then is called its scalar part and is called its vector part. Even though every quaternion can be viewed as a vector in a four-dimensional vector space, it is common to refer to the vector part as vectors in three-dimensional space. With this convention, a vector is the same as an element of the vector space formula_21

Hamilton also called vector quaternions right quaternions and real numbers (considered as quaternions with zero vector part) scalar quaternions.

If a quaternion is divided up into a scalar part and a vector part, that is,

formula_22

then the formulas for addition, multiplication, and multiplicative inverse are

formula_23

where &quot;formula_24&quot; and &quot;formula_25&quot; denote respectively the dot product and the cross product.

== Conjugation, the norm, and reciprocal ==
Conjugation of quaternions is analogous to conjugation of complex numbers and to transposition (also known as reversal) of elements of Clifford algebras. To define it, let formula_26 be a quaternion. The conjugate of is the quaternion formula_27. It is denoted by , &quot;qt&quot;, formula_28, or . Conjugation is an involution, meaning that it is its own inverse, so conjugating an element twice returns the original element. The conjugate of a product of two quaternions is the product of the conjugates &quot;in the reverse order&quot;. That is, if and are quaternions, then , not .
The conjugation of a quaternion, in stark contrast to the complex setting, can be expressed with multiplication and addition of quaternions:

formula_29

Conjugation can be used to extract the scalar and vector parts of a quaternion. The scalar part of is , and the vector part of is .

The square root of the product of a quaternion with its conjugate is called its &quot;norm&quot; and is denoted (Hamilton called this quantity the &quot;tensor&quot; of &quot;q&quot;, but this conflicts with the modern meaning of &quot;tensor&quot;). In formulas, this is expressed as follows:

formula_30

This is always a non-negative real number, and it is the same as the Euclidean norm on formula_4 considered as the vector space formula_32. Multiplying a quaternion by a real number scales its norm by the absolute value of the number. That is, if is real, then

formula_33

This is a special case of the fact that the norm is &quot;multiplicative&quot;, meaning that

formula_34

for any two quaternions and . Multiplicativity is a consequence of the formula for the conjugate of a product.
Alternatively it follows from the identity

formula_35

(where denotes the usual imaginary unit) and hence from the multiplicative property of determinants of square matrices.

This norm makes it possible to define the distance between and as the norm of their difference:

formula_36

This makes formula_4 a metric space.
Addition and multiplication are continuous in regard to the associated metric topology.
This follows with exactly the same proof as for the real numbers formula_38 from the fact that formula_4 is a normed algebra.

=== Unit quaternion ===

A unit quaternion is a quaternion of norm one. Dividing a nonzero quaternion by its norm produces a unit quaternion called the &quot;versor&quot; of :

formula_40

Every nonzero quaternion has a unique polar decomposition formula_41 while the zero quaternion can be formed from any unit quaternion.

Using conjugation and the norm makes it possible to define the reciprocal of a nonzero quaternion. The product of a quaternion with its reciprocal should equal 1, and the considerations above imply that the product of formula_42 and formula_43 is 1 (for either order of multiplication). So the &quot;reciprocal&quot; of is defined to be

formula_44

Since the multiplication is non-commutative, the quotient quantities or   are different (except if and are scalar multiples of each other or if one is a scalar): the notation is ambiguous and should not be used.

== Algebraic properties ==
The set formula_4 of all quaternions is a vector space over the real numbers with dimension 4. Multiplication of quaternions is associative and distributes over vector addition, but with the exception of the scalar subset, it is not commutative. Therefore, the quaternions formula_4 are a non-commutative, associative algebra over the real numbers. Even though formula_4 contains copies of the complex numbers, it is not an associative algebra over the complex numbers.

Because it is possible to divide quaternions, they form a division algebra. This is a structure similar to a field except for the non-commutativity of multiplication. Finite-dimensional associative division algebras over the real numbers are very rare. The Frobenius theorem states that there are exactly three: formula_38, formula_49, and formula_4. The norm makes the quaternions into a normed algebra, and normed division algebras over the real numbers are also very rare: Hurwitz&#x27;s theorem says that there are only four: formula_38, formula_49, formula_4, and formula_54 (the octonions). The quaternions are also an example of a composition algebra and of a unital Banach algebra.

Because the product of any two basis vectors is plus or minus another basis vector, the set forms a group under multiplication. This non-abelian group is called the quaternion group and is denoted . The real group ring of is a ring formula_55 which is also an eight-dimensional vector space over formula_56 It has one basis vector for each element of formula_57 The quaternions are isomorphic to the quotient ring of formula_55 by the ideal generated by the elements , , , and . Here the first term in each of the differences is one of the basis elements , and , and the second term is one of basis elements , and , not the additive inverses of , and .

== Quaternions and three-dimensional geometry ==
The vector part of a quaternion can be interpreted as a coordinate vector in formula_59 therefore, the algebraic operations of the quaternions reflect the geometry of formula_21 Operations such as the vector dot and cross products can be defined in terms of quaternions, and this makes it possible to apply quaternion techniques wherever spatial vectors arise. A useful application of quaternions has been to interpolate the orientations of key-frames in computer graphics.

For the remainder of this section, , , and will denote both the three imaginary basis vectors of formula_4 and a basis for formula_21 Replacing by , by , and by sends a vector to its additive inverse, so the additive inverse of a vector is the same as its conjugate as a quaternion. For this reason, conjugation is sometimes called the &quot;spatial inverse&quot;.

For two vector quaternions and their dot product, by analogy to vectors in formula_63 is

formula_64

It can also be expressed in a component-free manner as

formula_65

This is equal to the scalar parts of the products . Note that their vector parts are different.

The cross product of and relative to the orientation determined by the ordered basis , and is

formula_66

(Recall that the orientation is necessary to determine the sign.) This is equal to the vector part of the product (as quaternions), as well as the vector part of . It also has the formula

formula_67

For the commutator, , of two vector quaternions one obtains

formula_68

In general, let and be quaternions and write

formula_69

where and are the scalar parts, and and are the vector parts of and . Then we have the formula

formula_70

This shows that the noncommutativity of quaternion multiplication comes from the multiplication of vector quaternions. It also shows that two quaternions commute if and only if their vector parts are collinear. Hamilton showed that this product computes the third vertex of a spherical triangle from two given vertices and their associated arc-lengths, which is also an algebra of points in Elliptic geometry.

Unit quaternions can be identified with rotations in formula_71 and were called versors by Hamilton. Also see Quaternions and spatial rotation for more information about modeling three-dimensional rotations using quaternions.

See Hanson (2005) for visualization of quaternions.

== Matrix representations ==
Just as complex numbers can be represented as matrices, so can quaternions. There are at least two ways of representing quaternions as matrices in such a way that quaternion addition and multiplication correspond to matrix addition and matrix multiplication. One is to use 2 × 2 complex matrices, and the other is to use 4 × 4 real matrices. In each case, the representation given is one of a family of linearly related representations. These are injective homomorphisms from formula_4 to the matrix rings and , respectively.

The quaternion can be represented using a 2 × 2 complex matrix as

formula_73

This representation has the following properties:
* Constraining any two of , and to zero produces a representation of complex numbers. For example, setting produces a diagonal complex matrix representation of complex numbers, and setting produces a real matrix representation.
* The norm of a quaternion (the square root of the product with its conjugate, as with complex numbers) is the square root of the determinant of the corresponding matrix.
* The scalar part of a quaternion is one half of the matrix trace.
* The conjugate of a quaternion corresponds to the conjugate transpose of the matrix.
* By restriction this representation yields an isomorphism between the subgroup of unit quaternions and their image SU(2). Topologically, the unit quaternions are the 3-sphere, so the underlying space of SU(2) is also a 3-sphere. The group is important for describing spin in quantum mechanics; see Pauli matrices.
* There is a strong relation between quaternion units and Pauli matrices. The 2 × 2 complex matrix above can be written as formula_74, so in this representation the quaternion units correspond to = , so multiplying any two Pauli matrices always yields a quaternion unit matrix, all of them except for −1. One obtains −1 via ; e.g. the last equality is formula_75
* The representation in is not unique. A different convention, that preserves the direction of cyclic ordering between the quaternions and the Pauli matrices, is to choose formula_76 This gives an alternative representation, formula_77
Using 4 × 4 real matrices, that same quaternion can be written as

formula_78

However, the representation of quaternions in is not unique. For example, the same quaternion can also be represented as

formula_79

There exist 48 distinct matrix representations of this form in which one of the matrices represents the scalar part and the other three are all skew-symmetric. More precisely, there are 48 sets of quadruples of matrices with these symmetry constraints such that a function sending , and to the matrices in the quadruple is a homomorphism, that is, it sends sums and products of quaternions to sums and products of matrices. 
In this representation, the conjugate of a quaternion corresponds to the transpose of the matrix. The fourth power of the norm of a quaternion is the determinant of the corresponding matrix. The scalar part of a quaternion is one quarter of the matrix trace. As with the 2 × 2 complex representation above, complex numbers can again be produced by constraining the coefficients suitably; for example, as block diagonal matrices with two 2 × 2 blocks by setting .

Each 4×4 matrix representation of quaternions corresponds to a multiplication table of unit quaternions. For example, the last matrix representation given above corresponds to the multiplication table
which is isomorphic — through formula_80 — to

Constraining any such multiplication table to have the identity in the first row and column and for the signs of the row headers to be opposite to those of the column headers, then there are 3 possible choices for the second column (ignoring sign), 2 possible choices for the third column (ignoring sign), and 1 possible choice for the fourth column (ignoring sign); that makes 6 possibilities. Then, the second column can be chosen to be either positive or negative, the third column can be chosen to be positive or negative, and the fourth column can be chosen to be positive or negative, giving 8 possibilities for the sign. Multiplying the possibilities for the letter positions and for their signs yields 48. Then replacing with , with , with , and with and removing the row and column headers yields a matrix representation of .

== Lagrange&#x27;s four-square theorem ==

Quaternions are also used in one of the proofs of Lagrange&#x27;s four-square theorem in number theory, which states that every nonnegative integer is the sum of four integer squares. As well as being an elegant theorem in its own right, Lagrange&#x27;s four square theorem has useful applications in areas of mathematics outside number theory, such as combinatorial design theory. The quaternion-based proof uses Hurwitz quaternions, a subring of the ring of all quaternions for which there is an analog of the Euclidean algorithm.

== Quaternions as pairs of complex numbers ==

Quaternions can be represented as pairs of complex numbers. From this perspective, quaternions are the result of applying the Cayley–Dickson construction to the complex numbers. This is a generalization of the construction of the complex numbers as pairs of real numbers.

Let formula_81 be a two-dimensional vector space over the complex numbers. Choose a basis consisting of two elements and . A vector in formula_81 can be written in terms of the basis elements and as

formula_83

If we define and , then we can multiply two vectors using the distributive law. Using as an abbreviated notation for the product leads to the same rules for multiplication as the usual quaternions. Therefore, the above vector of complex numbers corresponds to the quaternion . If we write the elements of formula_81 as ordered pairs and quaternions as quadruples, then the correspondence is

formula_85

== Square roots ==

=== Square roots of −1 ===
In the complex numbers, formula_86 there are exactly two numbers, and , that give −1 when squared. In formula_4 there are infinitely many square roots of minus one: the quaternion solution for the square root of −1 is the unit sphere in formula_21 To see this, let be a quaternion, and assume that its square is −1. In terms of , , , and , this means

formula_89

To satisfy the last three equations, either or , , and are all 0. The latter is impossible because &quot;a&quot; is a real number and the first equation would imply that Therefore, and In other words: A quaternion squares to −1 if and only if it is a vector quaternion with norm 1. By definition, the set of all such vectors forms the unit sphere.

Only negative real quaternions have infinitely many square roots. All others have just two (or one in the case of 0).

==== As a union of complex planes ====
Each antipodal pair of square roots of −1 creates a distinct copy of the complex numbers inside the quaternions. If then the copy is the image of the function

formula_90

This is an injective ring homomorphism from formula_49 to formula_92 which defines a field isomorphism from formula_93 onto its image. The images of the embeddings corresponding to and − are identical.

Every non-real quaternion generates a subalgebra of the quaternions that is isomorphic to formula_86 and is thus a planar subspace of formula_95 write as the sum of its scalar part and its vector part:

formula_96

Decompose the vector part further as the product of its norm and its versor:

formula_97

(This is not the same as formula_98.) The versor of the vector part of , formula_99, is a right versor with –1 as its square. A straightforward verification shows that
formula_100
defines an injective homomorphism of normed algebras from formula_49 into the quaternions. Under this homomorphism, is the image of the complex number formula_102.

As formula_4 is the union of the images of all these homomorphisms, one can view the quaternions as a pencil of planes intersecting on the real line. Each of these complex planes contains exactly one pair of antipodal points of the sphere of square roots of minus one.

==== Commutative subrings ====
The relationship of quaternions to each other within the complex subplanes of formula_4 can also be identified and expressed in terms of commutative subrings. Specifically, since two quaternions and commute (i.e., ) only if they lie in the same complex subplane of formula_4, the profile of formula_4 as a union of complex planes arises when one seeks to find all commutative subrings of the quaternion ring.

=== Square roots of arbitrary quaternions ===

Any quaternion formula_107 (represented here in scalar–vector representation) has at least one square root formula_108 which solves the equation formula_109. Looking at the scalar and vector parts in this equation separately yields two equations, which when solved gives the solutions

formula_110

where formula_111 is the norm of formula_112 and formula_113 is the norm of formula_114. For any scalar quaternion formula_114, this equation provides the correct square roots if formula_116 is interpreted as an arbitrary unit vector.

Therefore, nonzero, non-scalar quaternions, or positive scalar quaternions, have exactly two roots, while 0 has exactly one root (0), and negative scalar quaternions have infinitely many roots, which are the vector quaternions located on formula_117, i.e., where the scalar part is zero and the vector part is located on the 2-sphere with radius formula_118.

==Functions of a quaternion variable==
Like functions of a complex variable, functions of a quaternion variable suggest useful physical models. For example, the original electric and magnetic fields described by Maxwell were functions of a quaternion variable. Examples of other functions include the extension of the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets into 4-dimensional space.

===Exponential, logarithm, and power functions===
Given a quaternion,

formula_119

the exponential is computed as

formula_120

and the logarithm is

formula_121

It follows that the polar decomposition of a quaternion may be written

formula_122

where the angle formula_123

formula_124

and the unit vector formula_125 is defined by:

formula_126

Any unit quaternion may be expressed in polar form as:

formula_127

The power of a quaternion raised to an arbitrary (real) exponent is given by:

formula_128

===Geodesic norm===
The geodesic distance between unit quaternions and is defined as:

formula_129

and amounts to the absolute value of half the angle subtended by and along a great arc of the sphere.
This angle can also be computed from the quaternion dot product without the logarithm as:

formula_130

==Three-dimensional and four-dimensional rotation groups==

The word &quot;conjugation&quot;, besides the meaning given above, can also mean taking an element to where is some nonzero quaternion. All elements that are conjugate to a given element (in this sense of the word conjugate) have the same real part and the same norm of the vector part. (Thus the conjugate in the other sense is one of the conjugates in this sense.) 

Thus the multiplicative group of nonzero quaternions acts by conjugation on the copy of formula_71 consisting of quaternions with real part equal to zero. Conjugation by a unit quaternion (a quaternion of absolute value 1) with real part is a rotation by an angle , the axis of the rotation being the direction of the vector part. The advantages of quaternions are:

* Avoiding gimbal lock, a problem with systems such as Euler angles.
* Faster and more compact than matrices.
* Nonsingular representation (compared with Euler angles for example).
* Pairs of unit quaternions represent a rotation in 4D space (see &quot;Rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space: Algebra of 4D rotations&quot;).

The set of all unit quaternions (versors) forms a 3-sphere and a group (a Lie group) under multiplication, double covering the group formula_132 of real orthogonal 3×3 matrices of determinant 1 since &quot;two&quot; unit quaternions correspond to every rotation under the above correspondence. See plate trick.

The image of a subgroup of versors is a point group, and conversely, the preimage of a point group is a subgroup of versors. The preimage of a finite point group is called by the same name, with the prefix binary. For instance, the preimage of the icosahedral group is the binary icosahedral group.

The versors&#x27; group is isomorphic to , the group of complex unitary 2×2 matrices of determinant 1.

Let be the set of quaternions of the form where and are either all integers or all half-integers. The set is a ring (in fact a domain) and a lattice and is called the ring of Hurwitz quaternions. There are 24 unit quaternions in this ring, and they are the vertices of a regular 24 cell with Schläfli symbol They correspond to the double cover of the rotational symmetry group of the regular tetrahedron. Similarly, the vertices of a regular 600 cell with Schläfli symbol } can be taken as the unit icosians, corresponding to the double cover of the rotational symmetry group of the regular icosahedron. The double cover of the rotational symmetry group of the regular octahedron corresponds to the quaternions that represent the vertices of the disphenoidal 288-cell.

== Quaternion algebras ==
The Quaternions can be generalized into further algebras called &quot;quaternion algebras&quot;. Take to be any field with characteristic different from 2, and and to be elements of ; a four-dimensional unitary associative algebra can be defined over with basis and , where , and (so ).

Quaternion algebras are isomorphic to the algebra of 2×2 matrices over or form division algebras over , depending on the choice of and .

== Quaternions as the even part of ==

The usefulness of quaternions for geometrical computations can be generalised to other dimensions by identifying the quaternions as the even part formula_133 of the Clifford algebra formula_134 This is an associative multivector algebra built up from fundamental basis elements using the product rules

formula_135
formula_136

If these fundamental basis elements are taken to represent vectors in 3D space, then it turns out that the &quot;reflection&quot; of a vector in a plane perpendicular to a unit vector can be written:

formula_137

Two reflections make a rotation by an angle twice the angle between the two reflection planes, so

formula_138

corresponds to a rotation of 180° in the plane containing &quot;σ&quot;1 and &quot;σ&quot;2. This is very similar to the corresponding quaternion formula,

formula_139

Indeed, the two structures formula_133 and formula_4 are isomorphic. One natural identification is

formula_142

and it is straightforward to confirm that this preserves the Hamilton relations

formula_143

In this picture, so-called &quot;vector quaternions&quot; (that is, pure imaginary quaternions) correspond not to vectors but to bivectors – quantities with magnitudes and orientations associated with particular 2D &quot;planes&quot; rather than 1D &quot;directions&quot;. The relation to complex numbers becomes clearer, too: in 2D, with two vector directions and , there is only one bivector basis element , so only one imaginary. But in 3D, with three vector directions, there are three bivector basis elements , , , so three imaginaries.

This reasoning extends further. In the Clifford algebra formula_144 there are six bivector basis elements, since with four different basic vector directions, six different pairs and therefore six different linearly independent planes can be defined. Rotations in such spaces using these generalisations of quaternions, called rotors, can be very useful for applications involving homogeneous coordinates. But it is only in 3D that the number of basis bivectors equals the number of basis vectors, and each bivector can be identified as a pseudovector.

There are several advantages for placing quaternions in this wider setting:
* Rotors are a natural part of geometric algebra and easily understood as the encoding of a double reflection.
* In geometric algebra, a rotor and the objects it acts on live in the same space. This eliminates the need to change representations and to encode new data structures and methods, which is traditionally required when augmenting linear algebra with quaternions.
* Rotors are universally applicable to any element of the algebra, not just vectors and other quaternions, but also lines, planes, circles, spheres, rays, and so on.
* In the conformal model of Euclidean geometry, rotors allow the encoding of rotation, translation and scaling in a single element of the algebra, universally acting on any element. In particular, this means that rotors can represent rotations around an arbitrary axis, whereas quaternions are limited to an axis through the origin.
* Rotor-encoded transformations make interpolation particularly straightforward.
* Rotors carry over naturally to pseudo-Euclidean spaces, for example, the Minkowski space of special relativity. In such spaces rotors can be used to efficiently represent Lorentz boosts, and to interpret formulas involving the gamma matrices.

For further detail about the geometrical uses of Clifford algebras, see Geometric algebra.

== Brauer group ==
The quaternions are &quot;essentially&quot; the only (non-trivial) central simple algebra (CSA) over the real numbers, in the sense that every CSA over the real numbers is Brauer equivalent to either the real numbers or the quaternions. Explicitly, the Brauer group of the real numbers consists of two classes, represented by the real numbers and the quaternions, where the Brauer group is the set of all CSAs, up to equivalence relation of one CSA being a matrix ring over another. By the Artin–Wedderburn theorem (specifically, Wedderburn&#x27;s part), CSAs are all matrix algebras over a division algebra, and thus the quaternions are the only non-trivial division algebra over the real numbers.

CSAs – finite dimensional rings over a field, which are simple algebras (have no non-trivial 2-sided ideals, just as with fields) whose center is exactly the field – are a noncommutative analog of extension fields, and are more restrictive than general ring extensions. The fact that the quaternions are the only non-trivial CSA over the real numbers (up to equivalence) may be compared with the fact that the complex numbers are the only non-trivial finite field extension of the real numbers.

<text>In abstract algebra, an element of a ring is called a left zero divisor if there exists a nonzero in such that , or equivalently if the map from to that sends to is not injective. Similarly, an element of a ring is called a right zero divisor if there exists a nonzero in such that . This is a partial case of divisibility in rings. An element that is a left or a right zero divisor is simply called a zero divisor. An element  that is both a left and a right zero divisor is called a two-sided zero divisor (the nonzero such that may be different from the nonzero such that ). If the ring is commutative, then the left and right zero divisors are the same.

An element of a ring that is not a left zero divisor (respectively, not a right zero divisor) is called left regular or left cancellable (respectively, right regular or right cancellable).
An element of a ring that is left and right cancellable, and is hence not a zero divisor, is called regular or cancellable, or a non-zero-divisor. A zero divisor that is nonzero is called a nonzero zero divisor or a nontrivial zero divisor. A non-zero ring with no nontrivial zero divisors is called a domain.

== Examples ==

* In the ring formula_1, the residue class formula_2 is a zero divisor since formula_3.
* The only zero divisor of the ring formula_4 of integers is formula_5.
* A nilpotent element of a nonzero ring is always a two-sided zero divisor.
* An idempotent element formula_6 of a ring is always a two-sided zero divisor, since formula_7.
* The ring of &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrices over a field has nonzero zero divisors if &quot;n&quot; ≥ 2. Examples of zero divisors in the ring of 2 × 2 matrices (over any nonzero ring) are shown here:
formula_8 formula_9
* A direct product of two or more nonzero rings always has nonzero zero divisors. For example, in formula_10 with each formula_11 nonzero, formula_12, so formula_13 is a zero divisor.
* Let formula_14 be a field and formula_15 be a group. Suppose that formula_15 has an element formula_17 of finite order formula_18. Then in the group ring formula_19 one has formula_20, with neither factor being zero, so formula_21 is a nonzero zero divisor in formula_19.

=== One-sided zero-divisor ===
* Consider the ring of (formal) matrices formula_23 with formula_24 and formula_25. Then formula_26 and formula_27. If formula_28, then formula_23 is a left zero divisor if and only if formula_30 is even, since formula_31, and it is a right zero divisor if and only if formula_32 is even for similar reasons. If either of formula_33 is formula_5, then it is a two-sided zero-divisor.
*Here is another example of a ring with an element that is a zero divisor on one side only. Let formula_35 be the set of all sequences of integers formula_36. Take for the ring all additive maps from formula_35 to formula_35, with pointwise addition and composition as the ring operations. (That is, our ring is formula_39, the &quot;endomorphism ring&quot; of the additive group formula_35.) Three examples of elements of this ring are the right shift formula_41, the left shift formula_42, and the projection map onto the first factor formula_43. All three of these additive maps are not zero, and the composites formula_44 and formula_45 are both zero, so formula_46 is a left zero divisor and formula_47 is a right zero divisor in the ring of additive maps from formula_35 to formula_35. However, formula_46 is not a right zero divisor and formula_47 is not a left zero divisor: the composite formula_52 is the identity. formula_53 is a two-sided zero-divisor since formula_54, while formula_55 is not in any direction.

== Non-examples ==
* The ring of integers modulo a prime number has no nonzero zero divisors. Since every nonzero element is a unit, this ring is a finite field.
* More generally, a division ring has no nonzero zero divisors.
* A non-zero commutative ring whose only zero divisor is 0 is called an integral domain.

== Properties ==
* In the ring of  ×  matrices over a field, the left and right zero divisors coincide; they are precisely the singular matrices. In the ring of  ×  matrices over an integral domain, the zero divisors are precisely the matrices with determinant zero.
* Left or right zero divisors can never be units, because if is invertible and for some nonzero , then , a contradiction.
* An element is cancellable on the side on which it is regular. That is, if is a left regular, implies that , and similarly for right regular.

== Zero as a zero divisor ==
There is no need for a separate convention for the case , because the definition applies also in this case: 
* If is a ring other than the zero ring, then is a (two-sided) zero divisor, because any nonzero element satisfies .
* If is the zero ring, in which , then is not a zero divisor, because there is no &quot;nonzero&quot; element that when multiplied by yields .

Some references include or exclude as a zero divisor in &quot;all&quot; rings by convention, but they then suffer from having to introduce exceptions in statements such as the following:
* In a commutative ring , the set of non-zero-divisors is a multiplicative set in . (This, in turn, is important for the definition of the total quotient ring.) The same is true of the set of non-left-zero-divisors and the set of non-right-zero-divisors in an arbitrary ring, commutative or not.
* In a commutative noetherian ring , the set of zero divisors is the union of the associated prime ideals of .

== Zero divisor on a module ==
Let be a commutative ring, let be an -module, and let be an element of . One says that is -regular if the &quot;multiplication by &quot; map formula_56 is injective, and that is a zero divisor on otherwise. The set of -regular elements is a multiplicative set in .

Specializing the definitions of &quot;-regular&quot; and &quot;zero divisor on &quot; to the case recovers the definitions of &quot;regular&quot; and &quot;zero divisor&quot; given earlier in this article.

<text>Zorn&#x27;s lemma, also known as the Kuratowski–Zorn lemma, is a proposition of set theory. It states that a partially ordered set containing upper bounds for every chain (that is, every totally ordered subset) necessarily contains at least one maximal element.

The lemma was proved (assuming the axiom of choice) by Kazimierz Kuratowski in 1922 and independently by Max Zorn in 1935. It occurs in the proofs of several theorems of crucial importance, for instance the Hahn–Banach theorem in functional analysis, the theorem that every vector space has a basis, Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem in topology stating that every product of compact spaces is compact, and the theorems in abstract algebra that in a ring with identity every proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal and that every field has an algebraic closure.

Zorn&#x27;s lemma is equivalent to the well-ordering theorem and also to the axiom of choice, in the sense that within ZF (Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice) any one of the three is sufficient to prove the other two. An earlier formulation of Zorn&#x27;s lemma is the Hausdorff maximal principle which states that every totally ordered subset of a given partially ordered set is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset of that partially ordered set.

==Motivation==

To prove the existence of a mathematical object that can be viewed as a maximal element in some partially ordered set in some way, one can try proving the existence of such an object by assuming there is no maximal element and using transfinite induction and the assumptions of the situation to get a contradiction. Zorn&#x27;s lemma tidies up the conditions a situation needs to satisfy in order for such an argument to work and enables mathematicians to not have to repeat the transfinite induction argument by hand each time, but just check the conditions of Zorn&#x27;s lemma.

==Statement of the lemma==
Preliminary notions:
* A set &quot;P&quot; equipped with a binary relation ≤ that is reflexive ( for every &quot;x&quot;), antisymmetric (if both and hold, then ), and transitive (if and then ) is said to be (partially) ordered by ≤. Given two elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; of &quot;P&quot; with &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot;, &quot;y&quot; is said to be greater than or equal to &quot;x&quot;. The word &quot;partial&quot; is meant to indicate that not every pair of elements of a partially ordered set is required to be comparable under the order relation, that is, in a partially ordered set &quot;P&quot; with order relation ≤ there may be elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; with neither &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; nor &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;. An ordered set in which every pair of elements is comparable is called totally ordered.
* Every subset &quot;S&quot; of a partially ordered set &quot;P&quot; can itself be seen as partially ordered by restricting the order relation inherited from &quot;P&quot; to &quot;S&quot;. A subset &quot;S&quot; of a partially ordered set &quot;P&quot; is called a chain (in &quot;P&quot;) if it is totally ordered in the inherited order.
* An element &quot;m&quot; of a partially ordered set &quot;P&quot; with order relation ≤ is maximal (with respect to ≤) if there is no other element of &quot;P&quot; greater than &quot;m&quot;, that is, if there is no &quot;s&quot; in &quot;P&quot; with &quot;s&quot; ≠ &quot;m&quot; and &quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;s&quot;. Depending on the order relation, a partially ordered set may have any number of maximal elements. However, a totally ordered set can have at most one maximal element.
* Given a subset &quot;S&quot; of a partially ordered set &quot;P&quot;, an element &quot;u&quot; of &quot;P&quot; is an upper bound of &quot;S&quot; if it is greater than or equal to every element of &quot;S&quot;. Here, &quot;S&quot; is not required to be a chain, and &quot;u&quot; is required to be comparable to every element of &quot;S&quot; but need not itself be an element of &quot;S&quot;.

Zorn&#x27;s lemma can then be stated as:

In fact, property (1) is redundant, since property (2) says, in particular, that the empty chain has an upper bound in formula_1, implying formula_1 is nonempty. However, in practice, one often checks (1) and then verifies (2) only for nonempty chains, since the case of the empty chain is taken care by (1).

In the terminology of Bourbaki, a partially ordered set is called inductive if each chain has an upper bound in the set (in particular, the set is then nonempty). Then the lemma can be stated as:

For some applications, the following variant may be useful.

Indeed, let formula_3 with the partial ordering from formula_1. Then, for a chain in formula_5, an upper bound in formula_1 is in formula_5 and so formula_5 satisfies the hypothesis of Zorn&#x27;s lemma and a maximal element in formula_5 is a maximal element in formula_1 as well.

== Example applications ==

=== Every vector space has a basis ===

Zorn&#x27;s lemma can be used to show that every vector space &quot;V&quot; has a basis.

If &quot;V&quot; = {0}, then the empty set is a basis for &quot;V&quot;. Now, suppose that &quot;V&quot; ≠ {0}. Let &quot;P&quot; be the set consisting of all linearly independent subsets of &quot;V&quot;. Since &quot;V&quot; is not the zero vector space, there exists a nonzero element v of &quot;V&quot;, so &quot;P&quot; contains the linearly independent subset {v}. Furthermore, &quot;P&quot; is partially ordered by set inclusion (see inclusion order). Finding a maximal linearly independent subset of &quot;V&quot; is the same as finding a maximal element in &quot;P&quot;.

To apply Zorn&#x27;s lemma, take a chain &quot;T&quot; in &quot;P&quot; (that is, &quot;T&quot; is a subset of &quot;P&quot; that is totally ordered). If &quot;T&quot; is the empty set, then {v} is an upper bound for &quot;T&quot; in &quot;P&quot;. Suppose then that &quot;T&quot; is non-empty. We need to show that &quot;T&quot; has an upper bound, that is, there exists a linearly independent subset &quot;B&quot; of &quot;V&quot; containing all the members of &quot;T&quot;.

Take &quot;B&quot; to be the union of all the sets in &quot;T&quot;. We wish to show that &quot;B&quot; is an upper bound for &quot;T&quot; in &quot;P&quot;. To do this, it suffices to show that &quot;B&quot; is a linearly independent subset of &quot;V&quot;.

Suppose otherwise, that &quot;B&quot; is not linearly independent. Then there exists vectors v1, v2, ..., vk ∈ &quot;B&quot; and scalars &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, ..., &quot;a&quot;k, not all zero, such that
:formula_11
Since &quot;B&quot; is the union of all the sets in &quot;T&quot;, there are some sets &quot;S&quot;1, &quot;S&quot;2, ..., &quot;S&quot;k ∈ &quot;T&quot; such that vi ∈ &quot;S&quot;i for every &quot;i&quot; = 1, 2, ..., &quot;k&quot;. As &quot;T&quot; is totally ordered, one of the sets &quot;S&quot;1, &quot;S&quot;2, ..., &quot;S&quot;k must contain the others, so there is some set &quot;S&quot;i that contains all of v1, v2, ..., vk. This tells us there is a linearly dependent set of vectors in &quot;S&quot;i, contradicting that &quot;S&quot;i is linearly independent (because it is a member of &quot;P&quot;).

The hypothesis of Zorn&#x27;s lemma has been checked, and thus there is a maximal element in &quot;P&quot;, in other words a maximal linearly independent subset &quot;B&quot; of &quot;V&quot;.

Finally, we show that &quot;B&quot; is indeed a basis of &quot;V&quot;. It suffices to show that &quot;B&quot; is a spanning set of &quot;V&quot;. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that &quot;B&quot; is not spanning. Then there exists some v ∈ &quot;V&quot; not covered by the span of &quot;B&quot;. This says that &quot;B&quot; ∪ {v} is a linearly independent subset of &quot;V&quot; that is larger than &quot;B&quot;, contradicting the maximality of &quot;B&quot;. Therefore, &quot;B&quot; is a spanning set of &quot;V&quot;, and thus, a basis of &quot;V&quot;.

=== Every nontrivial ring with unity contains a maximal ideal ===

Zorn&#x27;s lemma can be used to show that every nontrivial ring &quot;R&quot; with unity contains a maximal ideal.

Let &quot;P&quot; be the set consisting of all &quot;proper&quot; ideals in &quot;R&quot; (that is, all ideals in &quot;R&quot; except &quot;R&quot; itself). Since &quot;R&quot; is non-trivial, the set &quot;P&quot; contains the trivial ideal {0}. Furthermore, &quot;P&quot; is partially ordered by set inclusion. Finding a maximal ideal in &quot;R&quot; is the same as finding a maximal element in &quot;P&quot;.

To apply Zorn&#x27;s lemma, take a chain &quot;T&quot; in &quot;P&quot;. If &quot;T&quot; is empty, then the trivial ideal {0} is an upper bound for &quot;T&quot; in &quot;P&quot;. Assume then that &quot;T&quot; is non-empty. It is necessary to show that &quot;T&quot; has an upper bound, that is, there exists an ideal &quot;I&quot; ⊆ &quot;R&quot; containing all the members of &quot;T&quot; but still smaller than &quot;R&quot; (otherwise it would not be a proper ideal, so it is not in &quot;P&quot;).

Take &quot;I&quot; to be the union of all the ideals in &quot;T&quot;. We wish to show that &quot;I&quot; is an upper bound for &quot;T&quot; in &quot;P&quot;. We will first show that &quot;I&quot; is an ideal of &quot;R&quot;. For &quot;I&quot; to be an ideal, it must satisfy three conditions:

# &quot;I&quot; is a nonempty subset of &quot;R&quot;,
# For every &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;I&quot;, the sum &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; is in &quot;I&quot;,
# For every &quot;r&quot; ∈ &quot;R&quot; and every &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;I&quot;, the product &quot;rx&quot; is in &quot;I&quot;.

#1 - &quot;I&quot; is a nonempty subset of &quot;R&quot;.

Because &quot;T&quot; contains at least one element, and that element contains at least 0, the union &quot;I&quot; contains at least 0 and is not empty. Every element of &quot;T&quot; is a subset of &quot;R&quot;, so the union &quot;I&quot; only consists of elements in &quot;R&quot;.

#2 - For every &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;I&quot;, the sum &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; is in &quot;I&quot;.

Suppose &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are elements of &quot;I&quot;. Then there exist two ideals &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot; ∈ &quot;T&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; is an element of &quot;J&quot; and &quot;y&quot; is an element of &quot;K&quot;. Since &quot;T&quot; is totally ordered, we know that &quot;J&quot; ⊆ &quot;K&quot; or &quot;K&quot; ⊆ &quot;J&quot;. Without loss of generality, assume the first case. Both &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are members of the ideal &quot;K&quot;, therefore their sum &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; is a member of &quot;K&quot;, which shows that &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; is a member of &quot;I&quot;.

#3 - For every &quot;r&quot; ∈ &quot;R&quot; and every &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;I&quot;, the product &quot;rx&quot; is in &quot;I&quot;.

Suppose &quot;x&quot; is an element of &quot;I&quot;. Then there exists an ideal &quot;J&quot; ∈ &quot;T&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; is in &quot;J&quot;. If &quot;r&quot; ∈ &quot;R&quot;, then &quot;rx&quot; is an element of &quot;J&quot; and hence an element of &quot;I&quot;. Thus, &quot;I&quot; is an ideal in &quot;R&quot;.

Now, we show that &quot;I&quot; is a &quot;proper&quot; ideal. An ideal is equal to &quot;R&quot; if and only if it contains 1. (It is clear that if it is &quot;R&quot; then it contains 1; on the other hand, if it contains 1 and &quot;r&quot; is an arbitrary element of &quot;R&quot;, then &quot;r&quot;1 = &quot;r&quot; is an element of the ideal, and so the ideal is equal to &quot;R&quot;.) So, if &quot;I&quot; were equal to &quot;R&quot;, then it would contain 1, and that means one of the members of &quot;T&quot; would contain 1 and would thus be equal to &quot;R&quot; – but &quot;R&quot; is explicitly excluded from &quot;P&quot;.

The hypothesis of Zorn&#x27;s lemma has been checked, and thus there is a maximal element in &quot;P&quot;, in other words a maximal ideal in &quot;R&quot;.

==Proof sketch==
A sketch of the proof of Zorn&#x27;s lemma follows, assuming the axiom of choice. Suppose the lemma is false. Then there exists a partially ordered set, or poset, &quot;P&quot; such that every totally ordered subset has an upper bound, and that for every element in &quot;P&quot; there is another element bigger than it. For every totally ordered subset &quot;T&quot; we may then define a bigger element &quot;b&quot;(&quot;T&quot;), because &quot;T&quot; has an upper bound, and that upper bound has a bigger element. To actually define the function &quot;b&quot;, we need to employ the axiom of choice (explicitly: let formula_12, that is, the set of upper bounds for &quot;T&quot;. The axiom of choice furnishes formula_13).

Using the function &quot;b&quot;, we are going to define elements &quot;a&quot;0 &lt; &quot;a&quot;1 &lt; &quot;a&quot;2 &lt; &quot;a&quot;3 &lt; ... &lt; aω &lt; aω+1 &lt;…, in &quot;P&quot;. This uncountable sequence is really long: the indices are not just the natural numbers, but all ordinals. In fact, the sequence is too long for the set &quot;P&quot;; there are too many ordinals (a proper class), more than there are elements in any set (in other words, given any set of ordinals, there exists a larger ordinal), and the set &quot;P&quot; will be exhausted before long and then we will run into the desired contradiction.

The &quot;ai&quot; are defined by transfinite recursion: we pick &quot;a&quot;0 in &quot;P&quot; arbitrary (this is possible, since &quot;P&quot; contains an upper bound for the empty set and is thus not empty) and for any other ordinal &quot;w&quot; we set &quot;a&quot;&quot;w&quot; = &quot;b&quot;({&quot;a&quot;&quot;v&quot; : &quot;v&quot; &lt; &quot;w&quot;}). Because the &quot;a&quot;&quot;v&quot; are totally ordered, this is a well-founded definition.

The above proof can be formulated without explicitly referring to ordinals by considering the initial segments {&quot;a&quot;&quot;v&quot; : &quot;v&quot; &lt; &quot;w&quot;} as subsets of &quot;P&quot;. Such sets can be easily characterized as well-ordered chains &quot;S&quot; ⊆ &quot;P&quot; where each &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot; satisfies &quot;x&quot; = &quot;b&quot;({&quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot; : &quot;y&quot; &lt; &quot;x&quot;}). Contradiction is reached by noting that we can always find a &quot;next&quot; initial segment either by taking the union of all such &quot;S&quot; (corresponding to the limit ordinal case) or by appending &quot;b&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) to the &quot;last&quot; &quot;S&quot; (corresponding to the successor ordinal case).

This proof shows that actually a slightly stronger version of Zorn&#x27;s lemma is true:
Alternatively, one can use the same proof for the Hausdorff maximal principle. This is the proof given for example in Halmos&#x27; &quot;Naive Set Theory&quot; or in below.

Finally, the Bourbaki–Witt theorem can also be used to give a proof.

== Proof ==
The basic idea of the proof is to reduce the proof to proving the following weak form of Zorn&#x27;s lemma:

(Note that, strictly speaking, (1) is redundant since (2) implies the empty set is in formula_14.) Note the above is a weak form of Zorn&#x27;s lemma since Zorn&#x27;s lemma says in particular that any set of subsets satisfying the above (1) and (2) has a maximal element ((3) is not needed). The point is that, conversely, Zorn&#x27;s lemma follows from this weak form. Indeed, let formula_14 be the set of all chains in formula_1. Then it satisfies all of the above properties (it is nonempty since the empty subset is a chain.) Thus, by the above weak form, we find a maximal element formula_17 in formula_14; i.e., a maximal chain in formula_1. By the hypothesis of Zorn&#x27;s lemma, formula_17 has an upper bound formula_21 in formula_1. Then this formula_21 is a maximal element since if formula_24, then formula_25 is larger than or equal to formula_17 and so formula_27. Thus, formula_28.

The proof of the weak form is given in Hausdorff maximal principle#Proof. Indeed, the existence of a maximal chain is exactly the assertion of the Hausdorff maximal principle.

The same proof also shows the following equivalent variant of Zorn&#x27;s lemma:

Indeed, trivially, Zorn&#x27;s lemma implies the above lemma. Conversely, the above lemma implies the aforementioned weak form of Zorn&#x27;s lemma, since a union gives a least upper bound.

== Zorn&#x27;s lemma implies the axiom of choice ==
A proof that Zorn&#x27;s lemma implies the axiom of choice illustrates a typical application of Zorn&#x27;s lemma. (The structure of the proof is exactly the same as the one for the Hahn–Banach theorem.)

Given a set formula_29 of nonempty sets and its union formula_30 (which exists by the axiom of union), we want to show there is a function
:formula_31
such that formula_32 for each formula_33. For that end, consider the set
:formula_34.
It is partially ordered by extension; i.e., formula_35 if and only if formula_36 is the restriction of formula_37. If formula_38 is a chain in formula_1, then we can define the function formula_36 on the union formula_41 by setting formula_42 when formula_43. This is well-defined since if formula_44, then formula_45 is the restriction of formula_46. The function formula_36 is also an element of formula_1 and is a common extension of all formula_45&#x27;s. Thus, we have shown that each chain in formula_1 has an upper bound in formula_1. Hence, by Zorn&#x27;s lemma, there is a maximal element formula_36 in formula_1 that is defined on some formula_54. We want to show formula_55. Suppose otherwise; then there is a set formula_56. As formula_57 is nonempty, it contains an element formula_58. We can then extend formula_36 to a function formula_37 by setting formula_61 and formula_62. (Note this step does not need the axiom of choice.) The function formula_37 is in formula_1 and formula_65, a contradiction to the maximality of formula_36. formula_67

Essentially the same proof also shows that Zorn&#x27;s lemma implies the well-ordering theorem: take formula_1 to be the set of all well-ordered subsets of a given set formula_29 and then shows a maximal element of formula_1 is formula_29.

==History==
The Hausdorff maximal principle is an early statement similar to Zorn&#x27;s lemma.

Kazimierz Kuratowski proved in 1922 a version of the lemma close to its modern formulation (it applies to sets ordered by inclusion and closed under unions of well-ordered chains). Essentially the same formulation (weakened by using arbitrary chains, not just well-ordered) was independently given by Max Zorn in 1935, who proposed it as a new axiom of set theory replacing the well-ordering theorem, exhibited some of its applications in algebra, and promised to show its equivalence with the axiom of choice in another paper, which never appeared.

The name &quot;Zorn&#x27;s lemma&quot; appears to be due to John Tukey, who used it in his book &quot;Convergence and Uniformity in Topology&quot; in 1940. Bourbaki&#x27;s &quot;Théorie des Ensembles&quot; of 1939 refers to a similar maximal principle as &quot;le théorème de Zorn&quot;. The name &quot;Kuratowski–Zorn lemma&quot; prevails in Poland and Russia.

==Equivalent forms of Zorn&#x27;s lemma==
Zorn&#x27;s lemma is equivalent (in ZF) to three main results:
# Hausdorff maximal principle
# Axiom of choice
# Well-ordering theorem.

A well-known joke alluding to this equivalency (which may defy human intuition) is attributed to Jerry Bona:
&quot;The Axiom of Choice is obviously true, the well-ordering principle obviously false, and who can tell about Zorn&#x27;s lemma?&quot;

Zorn&#x27;s lemma is also equivalent to the strong completeness theorem of first-order logic.

Moreover, Zorn&#x27;s lemma (or one of its equivalent forms) implies some major results in other mathematical areas. For example,
# Banach&#x27;s extension theorem which is used to prove one of the most fundamental results in functional analysis, the Hahn–Banach theorem
# Every vector space has a basis, a result from linear algebra (to which it is equivalent). In particular, the real numbers, as a vector space over the rational numbers, possess a Hamel basis.
# Every commutative unital ring has a maximal ideal, a result from ring theory known as Krull&#x27;s theorem, to which Zorn&#x27;s lemma is equivalent
# Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem in topology (to which it is also equivalent)
# Every proper filter is contained in an ultrafilter, a result that yields the completeness theorem of first-order logic

In this sense, Zorn&#x27;s lemma is a powerful tool, applicable to many areas of mathematics.

=== Analogs under weakenings of the axiom of choice ===
A weakened form of Zorn&#x27;s lemma can be proven from ZF + DC (Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice replaced by the axiom of dependent choice). Zorn&#x27;s lemma can be expressed straightforwardly by observing that the set having no maximal element would be equivalent to stating that the set&#x27;s ordering relation would be entire, which would allow us to apply the axiom of dependent choice to construct a countable chain. As a result, any partially ordered set with exclusively finite chains must have a maximal element.

More generally, strengthening the axiom of dependent choice to higher ordinals allows us to generalize the statement in the previous paragraph to higher cardinalities. In the limit where we allow arbitrarily large ordinals, we recover the proof of the full Zorn&#x27;s lemma using the axiom of choice in the preceding section.

==In popular culture==

The 1970 film &quot;Zorns Lemma&quot; is named after the lemma.

The lemma was referenced on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in the episode &quot;Bart&#x27;s New Friend&quot;.

<doc id="51453" wikidata="Q2374166" url="?curid=51453" title="Singular function">
<text>In mathematics, a real-valued function &quot;f&quot; on the interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] is said to be singular if it has the following properties:

*&quot;f&quot; is continuous on [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]. (**)
*there exists a set &quot;N&quot; of measure 0 such that for all &quot;x&quot; outside of &quot;N,&quot; the derivative &quot;f&quot; (&quot;x&quot;) exists and is zero; that is, the derivative of &quot;f&quot; vanishes almost everywhere.
*&quot;f&quot; is non-constant on [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;].

A standard example of a singular function is the Cantor function, which is sometimes called the devil&#x27;s staircase (a term also used for singular functions in general). There are, however, other functions that have been given that name. One is defined in terms of the circle map.

If &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 0 for all &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot; and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 1 for all &quot;x&quot; ≥ &quot;b&quot;, then the function can be taken to represent a cumulative distribution function for a random variable which is neither a discrete random variable (since the probability is zero for each point) nor an absolutely continuous random variable (since the probability density is zero everywhere it exists).

Singular functions occur, for instance, as sequences of spatially modulated phases or structures in solids and magnets, described in a prototypical fashion by the Frenkel–Kontorova model and by the ANNNI model, as well as in some dynamical systems. Most famously, perhaps, they lie at the center of the fractional quantum Hall effect.

==When referring to functions with a singularity==

When discussing mathematical analysis in general, or more specifically real analysis or complex analysis or differential equations, it is common for a function which contains a mathematical singularity to be referred to as a &#x27;singular function&#x27;. This is especially true when referring to functions which diverge to infinity at a point or on a boundary. For example, one might say, &quot;&quot;1/x&quot; becomes singular at the origin, so &quot;1/x&quot; is a singular function.&quot;

Advanced techniques for working with functions that contain singularities have been developed in the subject called distributional or generalized function analysis. A weak derivative is defined that allows singular functions to be used in partial differential equations, etc.

<doc id="51456" wikidata="Q310247" url="?curid=51456" title="Mohammad Daoud Khan">
<text>Mohammad Daoud Khan (; also romanized as Daud Khan or Dawood Khan; 18July 190928April 1978) was an Afghan military officer and politician who served as prime minister of Afghanistan from 1953 to 1963 and, as leader of the 1973 Afghan coup d&#x27;état which overthrew the monarchy, served as the first president of Afghanistan from 1973 until he himself was deposed in a coup and killed in the Saur Revolution.

Born into the Afghan royal family and addressed by the prefix &quot;Sardar&quot;, Khan started as a provincial governor and later a military officer before being appointed as prime minister by his cousin, King Mohammad Zahir Shah, serving for a decade. Having failed to persuade the King to implement a one-party system, Khan overthrew the monarchy in a virtually bloodless coup with the backing of Afghan Army officers, and proclaimed himself the first president of the Republic of Afghanistan, establishing an autocratic one-party system under his National Revolutionary Party.

Khan was known for his autocratic rule, and for his educational and progressive social reforms. Under his regime, he headed a purge of communists in the government, and many of his policies also displeased religious conservatives and liberals who were in favor of restoring the multiparty system that existed under the monarchy. Social and economic reforms implemented under his ruling were successful, but his foreign policy led to tense relations with neighboring countries. In 1978, he was deposed and assassinated during the 1978 Afghan coup d&#x27;état, led by the Afghan military and the communist People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA). His body was discovered 30 years later and was identified by a small golden Quran gifted by King Khalid of Saudi Arabia he always carried. He received a state funeral.

== Early life ==
Mohammad Daoud Khan was born in Kabul, Emirate of Afghanistan, into a Barakzai Pashtun family and was the eldest son of the diplomat Prince Mohammad Aziz Khan (1877–1933; an older half-brother of King Mohammad Nadir Shah) and his wife, Khurshid Begum. His father was assassinated in 1933 in Berlin, while serving as the Afghan Ambassador to Germany. He and his brother Prince Naim Khan (1911–1978) then came under the tutelage of their uncle Mohammad Hashim Khan (1884–1953). Daoud proved to be an apt student of politics.

Educated in France, he served as a senior administrator in the Kingdom of Afghanistan, serving as Governor of the Eastern Province in 1934–35 and in 1938–39, and was Governor of Kandahar Province from 1935 to 1938.

In 1939, Khan was promoted to Commander of the Central Forces. As commander, he led Afghan forces against the Safi during the Afghan tribal revolts of 1944–1947. From 1946 to 1948, he served as Defense Minister, then Interior Minister from 1949 to 1951. In 1948, he served as Afghan Ambassador to France.

In 1951, he was promoted to General and served in that capacity as Commander of the Central Corps of the Afghan Armed Forces in Kabul from 1951 to 1953.

== Royal Prime Minister ==

Khan was appointed prime minister in September 1953 through an intra-family transfer of power, replacing Shah Mahmud Khan. His ten-year tenure was noted for his foreign policy turn to the Soviet Union, the completion of the Helmand Valley project, which dramatically improved living conditions in southwestern Afghanistan, as well as tentative steps towards the emancipation of women, giving women a higher public presence, which led to significant amounts of freedom and educational opportunities for them.

With the creation of an independent Pakistan in August 1947, Prime Minister Daoud Khan had rejected the Durand Line, which had been accepted as international border by successive Afghan governments for over a half a century. Khan supported a nationalistic reunification of the Pakistani Pashtun people with Afghanistan, but this would have involved taking a considerable amount of territory from the new nation of Pakistan and was in direct opposition to an older plan of the 1940s whereby a confederation between the two countries was proposed. The move further worried the non-Pashtun populations of Afghanistan such as the minority Hazara, Tajik, and Uzbek, who suspected his intention was to increase the Pashtuns&#x27; disproportionate hold on political power.

Abdul Ghaffar Khan (founder of Khudai Khidmatgar movement), stated &quot;that Daoud Khan only exploited the idea of reunification of Pashtun people to meet his own political ends. The idea of reunification of Pashtun people never helped Pashtuns and it only caused trouble for Pakistan. In fact it was never a reality&quot;. Moreover, Daoud Khan&#x27;s project for the reunification of the Pashtun people failed to gain support from the majority of Pashtuns in Pakistan.

In 1960, Khan sent troops across the poorly-marked Durand Line into the Bajaur Agency of Pakistan in an attempt to manipulate events in that area and to press the Pashtunistan issue, but the Afghan forces were defeated by the Pashtun Tribal militias. During this period, the propaganda war from Afghanistan, carried on by radio, was relentless. In 1961, Daoud Khan made another attempt to invade Bajaur with larger Afghan army this time. However, Pakistan employed F-86 Sabres jets which inflicted heavy casualties against the Afghan army unit and the tribesmen from Kunar province who were supporting the Afghan army. Several Afghan soldiers were also captured and were paraded in front of international media, which in turn caused embarrassment for Daoud Khan.

In 1961, as a result of his policies and support to militias in areas along the Durand Line, Pakistan closed its borders with Afghanistan and the latter severed ties, causing an economic crisis and greater dependence on the USSR. The USSR became Afghanistan&#x27;s principal trading partner. Within a few months, the USSR sent jet airplanes, tanks, heavy and light artillery, for a heavily discounted price tag of $25 million, to Afghanistan. That same year he attended the 1st Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade making Afghanistan one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement.

As a result of continued resentment against Daoud&#x27;s autocratic rule, close ties with the USSR and economic downturn because of the blockade imposed by Pakistan, Daoud Khan was asked to resign. Instead of resigning, Daoud Khan requested King Zahir Shah to approve new &#x27;one-party constitution&#x27; proposed by him which would in turn increase Daoud Khan&#x27;s already considerable power. Upon rejection, Daoud Khan angrily resigned.

The crisis was finally resolved with his forced resignation in March 1963 and the re-opening of the border in May. Pakistan continued to remain suspicious of Afghan intentions and Daoud&#x27;s policy left a negative impression in the eyes of many Tajiks who felt they were being disenfranchised for the sake of Pashtun nationalism. He was succeeded by Mohammad Yusuf.

In 1964, King Zahir Shah introduced a new constitution, for the first time excluding all members of the royal family from the Council of Ministers. Khan had already stepped down. In addition to having been prime minister, he had also held the portfolios of Minister of Defense and Minister of Planning until 1963.

== Presidency and death ==
Khan was unsatisfied with King Zahir Shah&#x27;s constitutional parliamentary system and lack of progress. He planned rebellion for more than a year before he seized power from the King on 17 July 1973. The coup was bloodless, and backed by a large number of army officers who were loyal to him, facing no resistance. Departing from tradition, and for the first time in Afghan history, he did not proclaim himself &quot;Shah&quot;, establishing instead a republic with himself as president. The role of pro-communist Parchamite officers in the coup led to him receiving the nickname &quot;Red Prince&quot; by some.

King Zahir Shah&#x27;s constitution establishing a parliament with elected members and the separation of powers was replaced by a now largely nominated loya jirga (meaning &quot;grand assembly&quot;). The parliament was disbanded.

Although he was close to the Soviet Union during his prime ministership, Khan continued the Afghan policy of non-alignment with the Cold War superpowers. Nor did he bring drastic pro-Soviet change to the economic system.

In Khan&#x27;s new cabinet, many ministers were fresh faced politicians, and only Dr Abdul Majid was a ministerial carryover from Khan&#x27;s Prime Minister era (1953–1963); Majid was Minister of Education from 1953 to 1957, and from 1973 was appointed Minister of Justice until 1977. Initially about half of the new cabinet were either current members, former members or sympathizers of the PDPA, but over time their influence would be eradicated by Khan.

A coup against Khan, which may have been planned before he took power, was repressed shortly after his seizure of power. In October 1973, Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal, a former prime minister and a highly respected former diplomat, was arrested in a coup plot and died in prison before his trial set for December 1973. This was at a time when Parchamites controlled the Ministry of Interior under circumstances corroborating the widespread belief that he had been tortured to death by the leftists. According to one account, Daoud Khan planned to appoint Maiwandwal as prime minister, leading to the Parchamite Minister of Interior, Faiz Mohammad, along with fellow communists, framing Maiwandwal in a coup plot, then torturing him to death without Daoud Khan&#x27;s knowledge. Louis Dupree wrote that Maiwandwal, one of few Afghan politicians with an international reputation, could have been a leader in a democratic process and therefore a target for communists. One of the army generals arrested under suspicion of this plot with Maiwandwal was Mohammed Asif Safi, who was later released. Khan personally apologized to him for the arrest.

In 1974, he signed one of two economic packages that aimed to greatly increase the capability of the Afghan military. At this time, there were increasing concerns that Afghanistan lacked a modern army comparable to the militaries of Iran and Pakistan.

In 1975, his government nationalized all banks in Afghanistan, including Da Afghanistan Bank, Afghanistan&#x27;s central bank.

Khan wanted to lessen the country&#x27;s dependence on the Soviet Union and attempted to promote a new foreign policy. In 1975 he visited some countries in the Middle East, including Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Iran, all of which were anti-Soviet states, to ask for aid, He also visited India. Regarding the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Havana, Khan said that Cuba &quot;only pretends to be non-aligned.&quot; Surprisingly, he did not renew the Pashtunistan agitation; relations with Pakistan improved thanks to interventions from the US and the Shah of Iran. These moves alerted the Soviets.

===Constitution of 1977===
In 1977, he established his own political party, the National Revolutionary Party, which became the focus of all political activity. In January 1977, a loya jirga approved a new constitution. It wrote in several new articles and amended others - one of these was the creation of a presidential one-party system of government.

He also began to moderate his socialist policies, although the 1977 constitution had a nationalist bend in addition to previous socialism and Islam. In 1978, there was a rift with the PDPA. Internally he attempted to distance himself from the communist elements within the coup. He was concerned about the tenor of many communists in his government and Afghanistan&#x27;s growing dependency on the Soviet Union. These moves were highly criticized by Moscow, which feared that Afghanistan would soon become closer to the West, especially the United States; the Soviets had always feared that the United States could find a way to influence the government in Kabul.
During his latter years in charge, his purge of communists in his government strained his relations with them, while his desire for one person rule created conflicts with the liberals who had been in charge during the monarchy. At the same time, his persecution of religious conservatives engendered enmity with them and their followers as well.

===Relations with Pakistan===

As during his time as prime minister, Daoud Khan again pressed on the question of Pashtunistan, again leading to sometimes tense relations with Pakistan.

Daoud hosted General Secretary of the National Awami Party Khan Abdul Wali Khan, Ajmal Khattak, Juma Khan Sufi, Baluch guerrillas, and others. Khan&#x27;s government and forces also commenced training of anti-Pakistani groups to conduct militant action and sabotage in Pakistan. The campaign was significant enough that even one of Bhutto&#x27;s senior colleagues, minister of interior and head of the provincial branch of Bhutto&#x27;s party of/in the then-North-West Frontier Province (renamed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2010), Hayat Sherpao, was killed, ostensibly on the orders of the later-acquitted Awami Party. As a result, Afghanistan&#x27;s already strained relationship with Pakistan further dipped and Pakistan likewise started similar kinds of cross-border interference. By 1975, Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, through its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), had begun to engage in promoting a proxy war in Afghanistan.

Since coming to power, under pressure from the PDPA and to increase domestic Pashtun support, Khan took a stronger line on the Pashtunistan issue and promoted a proxy war in Pakistan. Trade and transit agreements with Pakistan were subsequently severely affected.

The year 1975 was a watershed in Afghan-Pakistan relations. Pakistan blamed Afghanistan for unrest in Bajaur agency and the bombing of a PIA B707 at Islamabad airport in 1975. The 130 passengers of PIA B707 had deplaned before the explosion took place and thus no one was harmed in the explosion inside the aircraft.

At the same time, Afghanistan also faced several short lived uprisings in retaliation in eastern Afghanistan and in Panjshir valley, which Afghanistan blamed on Pakistan. There was also deployment of additional troops by both the countries along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.

The same year Kabul was also quietly negotiating with Islamabad to defuse the tensions between the two countries. In early 1976, relations between the two countries improved and the leaders of the two countries, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Douad Khan, exchanged visits. Daoud Khan was also worried about the growing power of communists within his government so he started improving his relations with Pakistan and Iran. The same year Pakistan also provided aid to Afghanistan to help alleviate the suffering caused by earthquake and floods in northern Afghanistan. This gesture by Pakistan had helped mollify Afghan public opinion about Pakistan.

By October 1976, the head of Pakistan intelligence agency, Jilani was informing a US diplomat that Afghanistan was no longer creating troubles for Pakistan. By August 1976 relations with Pakistan had improved to a high degree. Later on, while promoting his new foreign policy doctrine, Daoud Khan came to a tentative agreement on a solution to the Pashtunistan problem with Ali Bhutto.

=== Diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union ===

Khan met Leonid Brezhnev on a state visit to Moscow from 12 to 15 April 1977. He had asked for a private meeting with the Soviet leader to discuss with him the increased pattern of Soviet actions in Afghanistan. In particular, he discussed the intensified Soviet attempt to unite the two factions of the Afghan communist parties, Parcham and Khalq. Brezhnev described Afghanistan&#x27;s non-alignment as important to the USSR and essential to the promotion of peace in Asia, and warned him about the presence of experts from NATO countries stationed in the northern parts of Afghanistan. Daoud bluntly replied:&quot;we will never allow you to dictate to us how to run our country and whom to employ in Afghanistan. How and where we employ the foreign experts will remain the exclusive prerogative of the Afghan state. Afghanistan shall remain poor, if necessary, but free in its acts and decisions&quot; 

After returning to Afghanistan, he made plans that his government would downscale its relationship with the Soviet Union, and instead forge closer contacts with the West as well as the oil-rich Saudi Arabia and Iran. Afghanistan signed a co-operative military treaty with Egypt and by 1977, the Afghan military and police force were being trained by Egyptian Armed Forces. This angered the Soviet Union because Egypt took the same route in 1974 in distancing itself from the Soviet Union.

=== Communist coup and assassination ===

After the murder of Mir Akbar Khyber, the prominent Parchamite ideologue, his funeral on 19 April 1978 served as a rallying point for the Afghan communists. An estimated 1,000 to 3,000 people gathered to hear speeches by PDPA leaders such as Nur Muhammad Taraki, Hafizullah Amin and Babrak Karmal.

Shocked by this demonstration of communist unity, Khan ordered the arrest of the PDPA leaders, but he acted too slowly. It took him a week to arrest Taraki, Karmal managed to escape to the USSR, and Amin was merely placed under house arrest. Khan had misjudged the situation and believed that Karmal&#x27;s Parcham faction was the main communist threat. In fact, according to PDPA documents, Amin&#x27;s Khalq faction had extensively infiltrated the military and they outnumbered Parcham cells by a factor of 2 to 3. Amin sent complete orders for the coup from his home while it was under armed guard, using his family members as messengers.

The army had been put on alert on 26 April because of a presumed coup. On 27 April 1978, a coup d&#x27;état, beginning with troop movements at the military base at Kabul International Airport, gained ground slowly over the next twenty-four hours as rebels battled units loyal to Daoud Khan in and around the capital.

Khan and most of his family were assassinated during the coup by members of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA). The coup climaxed in the Arg, the former chief royal palace, during the early hours of 28 April 1978, involving heavy fighting and many deaths. Shortly afterwards, the new military leaders announced that Khan had been killed for refusing to pledge allegiance to the new regime by Lieutenant Imamuddin of the 444th Commando Battalion. Upon Daoud&#x27;s assassination, Afghan singer Fazal Ghani wrote the song “Khalqi Nizam” which mocked the former president for his baldness and for being “finished with one strike”, which was aired on Radio Television Afghanistan.

==Body and state funeral==
On 28 June 2008, his body and those of his family were found in two separate mass graves outside the walls of Pul-e-Charkhi prison, District 12 of Kabul city. Initial reports indicate that sixteen corpses were in one grave and twelve in the other. On 4 December 2008, the Afghan Health Ministry announced that Daoud&#x27;s body had been identified on the basis of teeth molds and a small golden Quran, a present he had received from the King of Saudi Arabia, found near the body.

On 17 March 2009, General Daoud was given a state funeral. His only surviving child, Dorkhanai, attended the funeral.

Daoud and following family members that were killed (resembling the Murder of the Romanov family by the Bolsheviks) on the same day on 28 April 1978 are buried at an incomplete hilltop tomb located 2.5 km west of Darul Aman Palace, Kabul.

==Public image==
News sources in the 1970s claimed that General Daoud Khan said he was happiest when he could &quot;light his American cigarettes with Soviet matches.&quot;

Mohammad Daoud Khan was retrospectively described as an &quot;old-fashioned statesman, compassionate yet reserved and authoritarian&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Nushin Arbabzadeh. Then-President Hamid Karzai hailed Khan&#x27;s courage and patriotism in comments after his 2009 state funeral, saying he was &quot;always thinking of the advancement and prosperity of the country.&quot; Some Afghans fondly consider him to be the best leader their country has had in modern times.
During his time as prime minister and president, Khan was highly unpopular among the non-Pashtun minorities in Afghanistan because of his alleged Pashtun favouritism. During his regime, all significant positions in the government, army and educational institutions were held by Pashtuns. His attempt at the Pashtunisation of Afghanistan reached such an extent that the word &#x27;Afghan&#x27; started being used to refer only to Pashtuns and not to the other minority groups who collectively formed a majority in Afghanistan.

The Afghan Armed Forces were allied with Daoud Khan and supported his goal of promoting Pashtuns to higher posts in the Afghan Armed Forces. In 1963, Afghan Uzbeks were barred from becoming high-ranking officers in the Afghan armed forces. Similarly only a few Tajiks were allowed to hold the position of officer in the Afghan army, while other ethnicities were excluded from those positions.

Daoud Khan viewed the Afghan armed forces as a crucial vector in the Pashtunisation of Afghan state. The Panjshir uprising in 1975 is also believed to be result of anti-Pashtun frustration which had been building up in Panjshir valley as result of Daoud Khan&#x27;s policies.

== Personal life ==

In September 1934, Daoud Khan married his cousin, Princess Zamina Begum (11 January 1917 – 28 April 1978), sister of King Zahir (15 October 1914 – 23 July 2007). The couple had four sons and four daughters:

<text>AutoLISP is a dialect of the programming language Lisp built specifically for use with the full version of AutoCAD and its derivatives, which include &quot;AutoCAD Civil 3D&quot;, &quot;AutoCAD Map 3D&quot;, &quot;AutoCAD Architecture&quot; and &quot;AutoCAD Mechanical&quot;. Neither the application programming interface (API) nor the interpreter to execute AutoLISP code is included in the AutoCAD LT product line (up to Release 2023, AutoCAD LT 2024 includes AutoLISP). A subset of AutoLISP functions is included in the browser-based AutoCAD web app.

==Features==
AutoLISP is a small, dynamically scoped, dynamically typed Lisp language dialect with garbage collection, immutable list structure, and settable symbols, lacking in such regular Lisp features as macro system, records definition facilities, arrays, functions with variable number of arguments or let bindings. Aside from the core language, most of the primitive functions are for geometry, accessing AutoCAD&#x27;s internal DWG database, or manipulation of graphical entities in AutoCAD. The properties of these graphical entities are revealed to AutoLISP as association lists in which values are paired with AutoCAD &quot;group codes&quot; that indicate properties such as definitional points, radii, colors, layers, linetypes, etc. AutoCAD loads AutoLISP code from .LSP files.

AutoLISP code can interact with the user through AutoCAD&#x27;s graphical editor by use of primitive functions that allow the user to pick points, choose objects on screen, and input numbers and other data. AutoLisp also has a built-in graphical user interface (GUI) mini- or domain-specific language (DSL), the Dialog Control Language, for creating modal dialog boxes with automated layout, within AutoCAD.

==History==
AutoLISP was derived from an early version of XLISP, which was created by David Betz. The language was introduced in AutoCAD Version 2.18 in January 1986, and continued to be enhanced in successive releases up to release 13 in February 1995. After that, its development was neglected by Autodesk in favor of more fashionable development environments like Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), .NET Framework, and ObjectARX. However, it has remained AutoCAD&#x27;s main user customizing language.

&quot;Vital-LISP&quot;, a considerably enhanced version of AutoLISP including an integrated development environment (IDE), debugger, compiler, and ActiveX support, was developed and sold by third-party developer Basis Software. Vital LISP was a superset of the existing AutoLISP language that added VBA-like access to the AutoCAD object model, reactors (event handling for AutoCAD objects), general ActiveX support, and some other general Lisp functions. Autodesk purchased this, renamed it &quot;Visual LISP&quot;, and briefly sold it as an add-on to AutoCAD release 14 released in May 1997. It was incorporated into AutoCAD 2000 released in March 1999, as a replacement for AutoLISP. Since then, Autodesk has ceased major enhancements to Visual LISP and focused more effort on VBA and .NET, and C++. , Autodesk ended support for VBA versions before 7.1, as part of a long-term process of changing from VBA to .NET for user customizing.

AutoLISP has such a strong following that other computer-aided design (CAD) application vendors add it to their products. Bricscad, IntelliCAD, DraftSight and others have AutoLISP functionality, so that AutoLISP users can consider using them as an alternative to AutoCAD. Most development involving AutoLISP since AutoCAD 2000 is performed within Visual LISP since the original AutoLISP engine was replaced with the Visual LISP engine. There are thousands of utilities and applications that have been developed using AutoLISP or Visual LISP (distributed as LSP, FAS and VLX files).

==Examples==
A simple Hello world program in AutoLISP would be:

(defun hello ( )
 (princ &quot;\nHello World!&quot;)
 (princ)

Note the final line inside the function definition: when evaluated with no arguments, the codice_1 function returns a null symbol, which is not displayed by the AutoCAD command-line interface. As the AutoCAD command line functions as a read–eval–print loop (REPL), this would normally print &quot;Hello World!&quot; to the command line, followed immediately by the return value of the call to codice_1. Therefore, without the final call to the codice_1 function, the result of this would be:
:codice_4
The codice_5 function may also be used to achieve the same result.

A more complex example is:

(defun c:pointlabel ( / pnt )
 (if (setq pnt (getpoint &quot;\nSpecify point: &quot;))
 (progn
 (entmake
 (list
 &#x27;(0 . &quot;POINT&quot;)
 (cons 10 (trans pnt 1 0))
 )
 (entmake
 (list
 &#x27;(0 . &quot;TEXT&quot;)
 (cons 10 (trans (cons (+ (car pnt) 0.6) (cdr pnt)) 1 0))
 (cons 40 (getvar &#x27;textsize))
 (cons 1 (strcat &quot;X:&quot; (rtos (car pnt)) &quot; Y:&quot; (rtos (cadr pnt))))
 )
 )
 (princ)

The above code defines a new function which generates an AutoCAD point object at a given point, with a one-line text object displaying the X and Y coordinates beside it. The name of the function includes a special prefix &#x27;c:&#x27;, which causes AutoCAD to recognize the function as a regular command. The user, upon typing &#x27;pointlabel&#x27; at the AutoCAD command line, would be prompted to pick a point, either by typing the X and Y coordinates, or clicking a location in the drawing. The function would then place a marker at that point, and create a one-line text object next to it, containing the X and Y coordinates of the point expressed relative to the active User Coordinate System (UCS). The function requires no parameters, and contains one local variable (&#x27;pnt&#x27;).

The above example could also be written using built-in AutoCAD commands to achieve the same result, however this approach is susceptible to changes to the command prompts between AutoCAD releases.

<doc id="51459" wikidata="Q130892" url="?curid=51459" title="South Platte River">
<text>The South Platte River is one of the two principal tributaries of the Platte River. Flowing through the U.S. states of Colorado and Nebraska, it is itself a major river of the American Midwest and the American Southwest/Mountain West. Its drainage basin includes much of the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, much of the populated region known as the Colorado Front Range and Eastern Plains, and a portion of southeastern Wyoming in the vicinity of the city of Cheyenne. It joins the North Platte River in western Nebraska to form the Platte, which then flows across Nebraska to the Missouri. The river serves as the principal source of water for eastern Colorado. In its valley along the foothills in Colorado, it has permitted agriculture in an area of the Colorado Piedmont and Great Plains that is otherwise arid.

==Description==

The river is formed in Park County, Colorado, southwest of Denver in the South Park grassland basin by the confluence of the South Fork and Middle Fork, about southeast of Fairplay. Both forks rise along the eastern flank of the Mosquito Range, on the western side of South Park, which is drained by the tributaries at the headwaters of the river. From South Park, it passes through of the Platte Canyon and its lower section, Waterton Canyon. Here, it is joined by the North Fork before emerging from the foothills southwest of the Denver suburb of Littleton. At Littleton, the river is impounded to form Chatfield Reservoir, a flood-control basin for the Denver metropolitan area.

The river flows north through central Denver, which was founded along its banks at its confluence with Cherry Creek. The valley through Denver is highly industrialized, serving generally as the route for both the railroad lines, as well as Interstate 25. On the north side of Denver, it is joined somewhat inconspicuously by Clear Creek, which descends from the mountains to the west in a canyon that was the cradle of the Pike&#x27;s Peak Gold Rush. North of Denver, it flows through the agricultural heartland of the Piedmont (a shale region that was formed through erosion by the ancestor of the river following the creation of the Rockies). It flows directly past the communities of Brighton and Fort Lupton, and is joined in succession by Saint Vrain Creek, the Little Thompson River, the Big Thompson River, and the Cache la Poudre River, which it receives just east of Greeley.

East of Greeley, it turns eastward, flowing across the Colorado Eastern Plains, past Fort Morgan and Brush, where it turns northeastward. It continues past Sterling, and runs into Nebraska between Julesburg, Colorado, and Big Springs, Nebraska. In Nebraska, it passes south of Ogallala and joins the North Platte River near the city of North Platte.

The South Platte River through Denver is on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s (US EPA) list of impaired waterbodies for pathogen impairment, with &quot;E. coli &quot;as the representative pathogen species. Other water issues involve the appearance of the New Zealand mud snail and zebra mussel.

The flows of the South Platte have been greatly modified by human activity. Originally the river was seasonal north of Fort Morgan to its confluence with the North Platte. In the 1800s the river would disappear in July, August, and September due to low flows and a sandy river bottom. By 1910 the increase in agriculture caused the river to reach the border of Colorado and Wyoming due to return flows and dams holding back water later in the year. Increasing diversions from the upper Colorado River in the 20th century mean that flows reach the North Platte year round.

==History==
The South Platte was originally called Niinéniiniicíihéhe by the native Arapaho people who lived on its banks. The early Spanish explorers called it the Rio Chato (calm river). In 1702, it was named the Rio Jesus Maria by Captain Jose Naranjo, the Indigenous-Spanish scout and captain of war of the New Mexico Indian Auxiliaries, who was ordered by the viceroy of New Spain to search the Tierra Incognita for a French incursion into New Mexico. The South Platte also served as a vital water source in Colorado. Long before the city of Denver was created, many travelers came to the South Platte River to escape the arid Great Plains. These people could survive the heat, but not without the vital water source that the South Platte gave them. Buckets and wells sufficed as a water system for a while, but eventually, the Denver Water System was created.

In the late 1830s, four fur trading outposts were established on the river.

==Dams==
In an arid region of the United States, the South Platte is marked with several dams. The first notable water impoundment on the South Platte is Antero Reservoir. &quot;Antero&quot; is derived from the Spanish word &quot;delantero&quot;, which means &quot;foremost&quot; or &quot;head&quot;, as the reservoir was the first dam on the South Platte River near the river&#x27;s origin.

The next dam is Spinney Mountain Reservoir. At capacity, Spinney Mountain covers . A bottom-release dam, Spinney releases to the east of the inlet.

Two miles below Spinney Mountain Reservoir, the river enters Eleven Mile Reservoir, with a capacity of . The Eleven Mile Reservoir Dam drains into Eleven Mile Canyon, which runs through Forest Service land. Three former Colorado towns, Howbert, Idlewild, and Freshwater Station, were submerged under the reservoir when it was built.

From Eleven Mile Canyon, the South Platte runs northeast to Cheesman Reservoir, named for Denver water pioneer Walter S. Cheesman. At its completion in 1905, the dam was the world&#x27;s tallest gravity dam, at above the streambed. The reservoir and related facilities were purchased in November 1918 by the Denver Water Board. Cheesman was the first reservoir of Denver&#x27;s mountain storage facilities, and has been designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. Cheesman Reservoir feeds Cheesman Canyon. Six miles below Cheesman Reservoir is the town of Deckers; there, the river bends north for about to the confluence with the North Fork of the South Platte.

In the late 1980s, a proposal was put forth for the Two Forks Dam, which would have created a reservoir flooding the entire section from the North Fork confluence to the town of Deckers. In 1990, the US EPA vetoed the permit, calling the project an &quot;environmental catastrophe.&quot;

From the confluence, the river flows towards Denver and enters Strontia Springs Reservoir.

Below Strontia Springs, the South Platte runs through Waterton Canyon before entering Chatfield Reservoir. Chatfield marks the seventh and final dam on the South Platte until it merges with the North Platte.

==Fly fishing overview==
The South Platte River is a gold medal western trout river on the eastern slope of Colorado, meaning it produces at least 12 trout of greater than 14 inches in length or greater per acre in areas accessible to the public. The river is well known for its wild trophy population of brown and rainbow trout. As a result of its close proximity to Denver, the river has thousands of fly fishing enthusiasts visit each year. With seven dams on the river, the South Platte is considered a tailwater fishery. Most of these dams are bottom released, which allows for both stable water temperatures and year-round fly fishing. Popular fly-fishing stretches of the river include Waterton Canyon, Cheesman Canyon, and the Dream Stream.

<text>A machine is a physical system that uses power to apply forces and control movement to perform an action. The term is commonly applied to artificial devices, such as those employing engines or motors, but also to natural biological macromolecules, such as molecular machines. Machines can be driven by animals and people, by natural forces such as wind and water, and by chemical, thermal, or electrical power, and include a system of mechanisms that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement. They can also include computers and sensors that monitor performance and plan movement, often called mechanical systems.

Renaissance natural philosophers identified six simple machines which were the elementary devices that put a load into motion, and calculated the ratio of output force to input force, known today as mechanical advantage.

Modern machines are complex systems that consist of structural elements, mechanisms and control components and include interfaces for convenient use. Examples include: a wide range of vehicles, such as trains, automobiles, boats and airplanes; appliances in the home and office, including computers, building air handling and water handling systems; as well as farm machinery, machine tools and factory automation systems and robots.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;machine&quot; comes through Middle French from Latin , which in turn derives from the Greek (Doric , Ionic &#x27;contrivance, machine, engine&#x27;, a derivation from &#x27;means, expedient, remedy&#x27;). The word &quot;mechanical&quot; (Greek: ) comes from the same Greek roots. A wider meaning of &#x27;fabric, structure&#x27; is found in classical Latin, but not in Greek usage. This meaning is found in late medieval French, and is adopted from the French into English in the mid-16th century.

In the 17th century, the word machine could also mean a scheme or plot, a meaning now expressed by the derived machination. The modern meaning develops out of specialized application of the term to stage engines used in theater and to military siege engines, both in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The OED traces the formal, modern meaning to John Harris&#x27; &quot;Lexicon Technicum&quot; (1704), which has:

:&quot;Machine, or Engine, in Mechanicks, is whatsoever hath Force sufficient either to raise or stop the Motion of a Body. Simple Machines are commonly reckoned to be Six in Number, viz. the Ballance, Leaver, Pulley, Wheel, Wedge, and Screw. Compound Machines, or Engines, are innumerable.&quot;
The word &quot;engine&quot; used as a (near-) synonym both by Harris and in later language derives ultimately (via Old French) from Latin &#x27;ingenuity, an invention&#x27;.

==History==

The hand axe, made by chipping flint to form a wedge, in the hands of a human transforms force and movement of the tool into a transverse splitting forces and movement of the workpiece. The hand axe is the first example of a wedge, the oldest of the six classic simple machines, from which most machines are based. The second oldest simple machine was the inclined plane (ramp), which has been used since prehistoric times to move heavy objects.

The other four simple machines were invented in the ancient Near East. The wheel, along with the wheel and axle mechanism, was invented in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) during the 5th millennium BC. The lever mechanism first appeared around 5,000 years ago in the Near East, where it was used in a simple balance scale, and to move large objects in ancient Egyptian technology. The lever was also used in the shadoof water-lifting device, the first crane machine, which appeared in Mesopotamia , and then in ancient Egyptian technology . The earliest evidence of pulleys date back to Mesopotamia in the early 2nd millennium BC, and ancient Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty (1991–1802 BC). The screw, the last of the simple machines to be invented, first appeared in Mesopotamia during the Neo-Assyrian period (911–609) BC. The Egyptian pyramids were built using three of the six simple machines, the inclined plane, the wedge, and the lever.

Three of the simple machines were studied and described by Greek philosopher Archimedes around the 3rd century BC: the lever, pulley and screw. Archimedes discovered the principle of mechanical advantage in the lever. Later Greek philosophers defined the classic five simple machines (excluding the inclined plane) and were able to roughly calculate their mechanical advantage. Hero of Alexandria (–75 AD) in his work &quot;Mechanics&quot; lists five mechanisms that can &quot;set a load in motion&quot;; lever, windlass, pulley, wedge, and screw, and describes their fabrication and uses. However, the Greeks&#x27; understanding was limited to statics (the balance of forces) and did not include dynamics (the tradeoff between force and distance) or the concept of work.
The earliest practical wind-powered machines, the windmill and wind pump, first appeared in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age, in what are now Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, by the 9th century AD. The earliest practical steam-powered machine was a steam jack driven by a steam turbine, described in 1551 by Taqi ad-Din Muhammad ibn Ma&#x27;ruf in Ottoman Egypt.

The cotton gin was invented in India by the 6th century AD, and the spinning wheel was invented in the Islamic world by the early 11th century, both of which were fundamental to the growth of the cotton industry. The spinning wheel was also a precursor to the spinning jenny.

The earliest programmable machines were developed in the Muslim world. A music sequencer, a programmable musical instrument, was the earliest type of programmable machine. The first music sequencer was an automated flute player invented by the Banu Musa brothers, described in their &quot;Book of Ingenious Devices&quot;, in the 9th century. In 1206, Al-Jazari invented programmable automata/robots. He described four automaton musicians, including drummers operated by a programmable drum machine, where they could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns.

During the Renaissance, the dynamics of the &quot;Mechanical Powers&quot;, as the simple machines were called, began to be studied from the standpoint of how much useful work they could perform, leading eventually to the new concept of mechanical work. In 1586 Flemish engineer Simon Stevin derived the mechanical advantage of the inclined plane, and it was included with the other simple machines. The complete dynamic theory of simple machines was worked out by Italian scientist Galileo Galilei in 1600 in &quot;Le Meccaniche&quot; (&quot;On Mechanics&quot;). He was the first to understand that simple machines do not create energy, they merely transform it.

The classic rules of sliding friction in machines were discovered by Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), but remained unpublished in his notebooks. They were rediscovered by Guillaume Amontons (1699) and were further developed by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (1785).

James Watt patented his parallel motion linkage in 1782, which made the double acting steam engine practical. The Boulton and Watt steam engine and later designs powered steam locomotives, steam ships, and factories.
The Industrial Revolution was a period from 1750 to 1850 where changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, transportation, and technology had a profound effect on the social, economic and cultural conditions of the times. It began in the United Kingdom, then subsequently spread throughout Western Europe, North America, Japan, and eventually the rest of the world.

Starting in the later part of the 18th century, there began a transition in parts of Great Britain&#x27;s previously manual labour and draft-animal-based economy towards machine-based manufacturing. It started with the mechanisation of the textile industries, the development of iron-making techniques and the increased use of refined coal.

== Simple machines ==

The idea that a machine can be decomposed into simple movable elements led Archimedes to define the lever, pulley and screw as simple machines. By the time of the Renaissance this list increased to include the wheel and axle, wedge and inclined plane. The modern approach to characterizing machines focusses on the components that allow movement, known as joints.

Wedge (hand axe): Perhaps the first example of a device designed to manage power is the hand axe, also called biface and Olorgesailie. A hand axe is made by chipping stone, generally flint, to form a bifacial edge, or wedge. A wedge is a simple machine that transforms lateral force and movement of the tool into a transverse splitting force and movement of the workpiece. The available power is limited by the effort of the person using the tool, but because power is the product of force and movement, the wedge amplifies the force by reducing the movement. This amplification, or mechanical advantage is the ratio of the input speed to output speed. For a wedge this is given by 1/tanα, where α is the tip angle. The faces of a wedge are modeled as straight lines to form a sliding or prismatic joint.

Lever: The lever is another important and simple device for managing power. This is a body that pivots on a fulcrum. Because the velocity of a point farther from the pivot is greater than the velocity of a point near the pivot, forces applied far from the pivot are amplified near the pivot by the associated decrease in speed. If &quot;a&quot; is the distance from the pivot to the point where the input force is applied and &quot;b&quot; is the distance to the point where the output force is applied, then &quot;a/b&quot; is the mechanical advantage of the lever. The fulcrum of a lever is modeled as a hinged or revolute joint.

Wheel: The wheel is an important early machine, such as the chariot. A wheel uses the law of the lever to reduce the force needed to overcome friction when pulling a load. To see this notice that the friction associated with pulling a load on the ground is approximately the same as the friction in a simple bearing that supports the load on the axle of a wheel. However, the wheel forms a lever that magnifies the pulling force so that it overcomes the frictional resistance in the bearing.
The classification of simple machines to provide a strategy for the design of new machines was developed by Franz Reuleaux, who collected and studied over 800 elementary machines. He recognized that the classical simple machines can be separated into the lever, pulley and wheel and axle that are formed by a body rotating about a hinge, and the inclined plane, wedge and screw that are similarly a block sliding on a flat surface.

Simple machines are elementary examples of kinematic chains or linkages that are used to model mechanical systems ranging from the steam engine to robot manipulators. The bearings that form the fulcrum of a lever and that allow the wheel and axle and pulleys to rotate are examples of a kinematic pair called a hinged joint. Similarly, the flat surface of an inclined plane and wedge are examples of the kinematic pair called a sliding joint. The screw is usually identified as its own kinematic pair called a helical joint.

This realization shows that it is the joints, or the connections that provide movement, that are the primary elements of a machine. Starting with four types of joints, the rotary joint, sliding joint, cam joint and gear joint, and related connections such as cables and belts, it is possible to understand a machine as an assembly of solid parts that connect these joints called a mechanism .

Two levers, or cranks, are combined into a planar four-bar linkage by attaching a link that connects the output of one crank to the input of another. Additional links can be attached to form a six-bar linkage or in series to form a robot.

==Mechanical systems==
A mechanical system manages power to accomplish a task that involves forces and movement. Modern machines are systems consisting of (i) a power source and actuators that generate forces and movement, (ii) a system of mechanisms that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement, (iii) a controller with sensors that compare the output to a performance goal and then directs the actuator input, and (iv) an interface to an operator consisting of levers, switches, and displays. This can be seen in Watt&#x27;s steam engine in which the power is provided by steam expanding to drive the piston. The walking beam, coupler and crank transform the linear movement of the piston into rotation of the output pulley. Finally, the pulley rotation drives the flyball governor which controls the valve for the steam input to the piston cylinder.

The adjective &quot;mechanical&quot; refers to skill in the practical application of an art or science, as well as relating to or caused by movement, physical forces, properties or agents such as is dealt with by mechanics. Similarly Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines &quot;mechanical&quot; as relating to machinery or tools.

Power flow through a machine provides a way to understand the performance of devices ranging from levers and gear trains to automobiles and robotic systems. The German mechanician Franz Reuleaux wrote, &quot;a machine is a combination of resistant bodies so arranged that by their means the mechanical forces of nature can be compelled to do work accompanied by certain determinate motion.&quot; Notice that forces and motion combine to define power.

More recently, Uicker et al. stated that a machine is &quot;a device for applying power or changing its direction.&quot;McCarthy and Soh describe a machine as a system that &quot;generally consists of a power source and a mechanism for the controlled use of this power.&quot;

== Power sources ==

Human and animal effort were the original power sources for early machines.

Waterwheel: Waterwheels appeared around the world around 300 BC to use flowing water to generate rotary motion, which was applied to milling grain, and powering lumber, machining and textile operations. Modern water turbines use water flowing through a dam to drive an electric generator.

Windmill: Early windmills captured wind power to generate rotary motion for milling operations. Modern wind turbines also drives a generator. This electricity in turn is used to drive motors forming the actuators of mechanical systems.

Engine: The word engine derives from &quot;ingenuity&quot; and originally referred to contrivances that may or may not be physical devices. A steam engine uses heat to boil water contained in a pressure vessel; the expanding steam drives a piston or a turbine. This principle can be seen in the aeolipile of Hero of Alexandria. This is called an external combustion engine.

An automobile engine is called an internal combustion engine because it burns fuel (an exothermic chemical reaction) inside a cylinder and uses the expanding gases to drive a piston. A jet engine uses a turbine to compress air which is burned with fuel so that it expands through a nozzle to provide thrust to an aircraft, and so is also an &quot;internal combustion engine.&quot; 

Power plant: The heat from coal and natural gas combustion in a boiler generates steam that drives a steam turbine to rotate an electric generator. A nuclear power plant uses heat from a nuclear reactor to generate steam and electric power. This power is distributed through a network of transmission lines for industrial and individual use.

Motors: Electric motors use either AC or DC electric current to generate rotational movement. Electric servomotors are the actuators for mechanical systems ranging from robotic systems to modern aircraft.

Fluid Power: Hydraulic and pneumatic systems use electrically driven pumps to drive water or air respectively into cylinders to power linear movement.

Electrochemical: Chemicals and materials can also be sources of power. They may chemically deplete or need re-charging, as is the case with batteries, or they may produce power without changing their state, which is the case for solar cells and thermoelectric generators. All of these, however, still require their energy to come from elsewhere. With batteries, it is the already existing chemical potential energy inside. In solar cells and thermoelectrics, the energy source is light and heat respectively.

== Mechanisms ==
The &quot;mechanism&quot; of a mechanical system is assembled from components called &quot;machine elements&quot;. These elements provide structure for the system and control its movement.

The structural components are, generally, the frame members, bearings, splines, springs, seals, fasteners and covers. The shape, texture and color of covers provide a styling and operational interface between the mechanical system and its users.

The assemblies that control movement are also called &quot;mechanisms.&quot; Mechanisms are generally classified as gears and gear trains, which includes belt drives and chain drives, cam and follower mechanisms, and linkages, though there are other special mechanisms such as clamping linkages, indexing mechanisms, escapements and friction devices such as brakes and clutches.

The number of degrees of freedom of a mechanism, or its mobility, depends on the number of links and joints and the types of joints used to construct the mechanism. The general mobility of a mechanism is the difference between the unconstrained freedom of the links and the number of constraints imposed by the joints. It is described by the Chebychev–Grübler–Kutzbach criterion.

=== Gears and gear trains ===

The transmission of rotation between contacting toothed wheels can be traced back to the Antikythera mechanism of Greece and the south-pointing chariot of China. Illustrations by the renaissance scientist Georgius Agricola show gear trains with cylindrical teeth. The implementation of the involute tooth yielded a standard gear design that provides a constant speed ratio. Some important features of gears and gear trains are:
* The ratio of the pitch circles of mating gears defines the speed ratio and the mechanical advantage of the gear set.
* A planetary gear train provides high gear reduction in a compact package.
* It is possible to design gear teeth for gears that are non-circular, yet still transmit torque smoothly.
* The speed ratios of chain and belt drives are computed in the same way as gear ratios. See bicycle gearing.

=== Cam and follower mechanisms ===
A cam and follower is formed by the direct contact of two specially shaped links. The driving link is called the cam (also see cam shaft) and the link that is driven through the direct contact of their surfaces is called the follower. The shape of the contacting surfaces of the cam and follower determines the movement of the mechanism.

=== Linkages ===

A linkage is a collection of links connected by joints. Generally, the links are the structural elements and the joints allow movement. Perhaps the single most useful example is the planar four-bar linkage. However, there are many more special linkages:
* Watt&#x27;s linkage is a four-bar linkage that generates an approximate straight line. It was critical to the operation of his design for the steam engine. This linkage also appears in vehicle suspensions to prevent side-to-side movement of the body relative to the wheels. Also see the article Parallel motion.
* The success of Watt&#x27;s linkage lead to the design of similar approximate straight-line linkages, such as Hoeken&#x27;s linkage and Chebyshev&#x27;s linkage.
* The Peaucellier linkage generates a true straight-line output from a rotary input.
* The Sarrus linkage is a spatial linkage that generates straight-line movement from a rotary input.
* The Klann linkage and the Jansen linkage are recent inventions that provide interesting walking movements. They are respectively a six-bar and an eight-bar linkage.

===Planar mechanism===
A planar mechanism is a mechanical system that is constrained so the trajectories of points in all the bodies of the system lie on planes parallel to a ground plane. The rotational axes of hinged joints that connect the bodies in the system are perpendicular to this ground plane.

===Spherical mechanism===
A spherical mechanism is a mechanical system in which the bodies move in a way that the trajectories of points in the system lie on concentric spheres. The rotational axes of hinged joints that connect the bodies in the system pass through the center of these circle.

===Spatial mechanism===
A spatial mechanism is a mechanical system that has at least one body that moves in a way that its point trajectories are general space curves. The rotational axes of hinged joints that connect the bodies in the system form lines in space that do not intersect and have distinct common normals.

=== Flexure mechanisms ===
A flexure mechanism consists of a series of rigid bodies connected by compliant elements (also known as flexure joints) that is designed to produce a geometrically well-defined motion upon application of a force.

==Machine elements==
The elementary mechanical components of a machine are termed machine elements. These elements consist of three basic types (i) &quot;structural components&quot; such as frame members, bearings, axles, splines, fasteners, seals, and lubricants, (ii) &quot;mechanisms&quot; that control movement in various ways such as gear trains, belt or chain drives, linkages, cam and follower systems, including brakes and clutches, and (iii) &quot;control components&quot; such as buttons, switches, indicators, sensors, actuators and computer controllers. While generally not considered to be a machine element, the shape, texture and color of covers are an important part of a machine that provide a styling and operational interface between the mechanical components of a machine and its users.

===Structural components===
A number of machine elements provide important structural functions such as the frame, bearings, splines, spring and seals.
* The recognition that the frame of a mechanism is an important machine element changed the name three-bar linkage into four-bar linkage. Frames are generally assembled from truss or beam elements.
* Bearings are components designed to manage the interface between moving elements and are the source of friction in machines. In general, bearings are designed for pure rotation or straight line movement.
* Splines and keys are two ways to reliably mount an axle to a wheel, pulley or gear so that torque can be transferred through the connection.
* Springs provides forces that can either hold components of a machine in place or acts as a suspension to support part of a machine.
* Seals are used between mating parts of a machine to ensure fluids, such as water, hot gases, or lubricant do not leak between the mating surfaces.
* Fasteners such as screws, bolts, spring clips, and rivets are critical to the assembly of components of a machine. Fasteners are generally considered to be removable. In contrast, joining methods, such as welding, soldering, crimping and the application of adhesives, usually require cutting the parts to disassemble the components

== Controllers ==
Controllers combine sensors, logic, and actuators to maintain the performance of components of a machine. Perhaps the best known is the flyball governor for a steam engine. Examples of these devices range from a thermostat that as temperature rises opens a valve to cooling water to speed controllers such as the cruise control system in an automobile. The programmable logic controller replaced relays and specialized control mechanisms with a programmable computer. Servomotors that accurately position a shaft in response to an electrical command are the actuators that make robotic systems possible.

== Computing machines ==

Charles Babbage designed machines to tabulate logarithms and other functions in 1837. His Difference engine can be considered an advanced mechanical calculator and his Analytical Engine a forerunner of the modern computer, though none of the larger designs were completed in Babbage&#x27;s lifetime.

The Arithmometer and the Comptometer are mechanical computers that are precursors to modern digital computers. Models used to study modern computers are termed State machine and Turing machine.

== Molecular machines ==

The biological molecule myosin reacts to ATP and ADP to alternately engage with an actin filament and change its shape in a way that exerts a force, and then disengage to reset its shape, or conformation. This acts as the molecular drive that causes muscle contraction. Similarly the biological molecule kinesin has two sections that alternately engage and disengage with microtubules causing the molecule to move along the microtubule and transport vesicles within the cell, and dynein, which moves cargo inside cells towards the nucleus and produces the axonemal beating of motile cilia and flagella. &quot;In effect, the motile cilium is a nanomachine composed of perhaps over 600 proteins in molecular complexes, many of which also function independently as nanomachines. Flexible linkers allow the mobile protein domains connected by them to recruit their binding partners and induce long-range allostery via protein domain dynamics. &quot; Other biological machines are responsible for energy production, for example ATP synthase which harnesses energy from proton gradients across membranes to drive a turbine-like motion used to synthesise ATP, the energy currency of a cell. Still other machines are responsible for gene expression, including DNA polymerases for replicating DNA, RNA polymerases for producing mRNA, the spliceosome for removing introns, and the ribosome for synthesising proteins. These machines and their nanoscale dynamics are far more complex than any molecular machines that have yet been artificially constructed. These molecules are increasingly considered to be nanomachines.

Researchers have used DNA to construct nano-dimensioned four-bar linkages.

==Impact==
===Mechanization and automation===
Mechanization (or mechanisation in BE) is providing human operators with machinery that assists them with the muscular requirements of work or displaces muscular work. In some fields, mechanization includes the use of hand tools. In modern usage, such as in engineering or economics, mechanization implies machinery more complex than hand tools and would not include simple devices such as an un-geared horse or donkey mill. Devices that cause speed changes or changes to or from reciprocating to rotary motion, using means such as gears, pulleys or sheaves and belts, shafts, cams and cranks, usually are considered machines. After electrification, when most small machinery was no longer hand powered, mechanization was synonymous with motorized machines.

Automation is the use of control systems and information technologies to reduce the need for human work in the production of goods and services. In the scope of industrialization, automation is a step beyond mechanization. Whereas mechanization provides human operators with machinery to assist them with the muscular requirements of work, automation greatly decreases the need for human sensory and mental requirements as well. Automation plays an increasingly important role in the world economy and in daily experience.

===Automata===

An automaton (plural: automata or automatons) is a self-operating machine. The word is sometimes used to describe a robot, more specifically an autonomous robot. A &quot;Toy Automaton&quot; was patented in 1863.

== Mechanics ==
Usher reports that Hero of Alexandria&#x27;s treatise on &quot;Mechanics&quot; focussed on the study of lifting heavy weights. Today mechanics refers to the mathematical analysis of the forces and movement of a mechanical system, and consists of the study of the kinematics and dynamics of these systems.

===Dynamics of machines===
The dynamic analysis of machines begins with a rigid-body model to determine reactions at the bearings, at which point the elasticity effects are included. The rigid-body dynamics studies the movement of systems of interconnected bodies under the action of external forces. The assumption that the bodies are rigid, which means that they do not deform under the action of applied forces, simplifies the analysis by reducing the parameters that describe the configuration of the system to the translation and rotation of reference frames attached to each body.

The dynamics of a rigid body system is defined by its equations of motion, which are derived using either Newtons laws of motion or Lagrangian mechanics. The solution of these equations of motion defines how the configuration of the system of rigid bodies changes as a function of time. The formulation and solution of rigid body dynamics is an important tool in the computer simulation of mechanical systems.

=== Kinematics of machines ===
The dynamic analysis of a machine requires the determination of the movement, or kinematics, of its component parts, known as kinematic analysis. The assumption that the system is an assembly of rigid components allows rotational and translational movement to be modeled mathematically as Euclidean, or rigid, transformations. This allows the position, velocity and acceleration of all points in a component to be determined from these properties for a reference point, and the angular position, angular velocity and angular acceleration of the component.

== Machine design ==
Machine design refers to the procedures and techniques used to address the three phases of a machine&#x27;s lifecycle:
# invention, which involves the identification of a need, development of requirements, concept generation, prototype development, manufacturing, and verification testing;
# performance engineering involves enhancing manufacturing efficiency, reducing service and maintenance demands, adding features and improving effectiveness, and validation testing;
# recycle is the decommissioning and disposal phase and includes recovery and reuse of materials and components.
