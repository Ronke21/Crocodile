<text>In chemistry, hydronium (hydroxonium in traditional British English) is the cation , also written as , the type of oxonium ion produced by protonation of water. It is often viewed as the positive ion present when an Arrhenius acid is dissolved in water, as Arrhenius acid molecules in solution give up a proton (a positive hydrogen ion, ) to the surrounding water molecules (). In fact, acids must be surrounded by more than a single water molecule in order to ionize, yielding aqueous and conjugate base.

Three main structures for the aqueous proton have garnered experimental support:

* the Eigen cation, which is a tetrahydrate, H3O+(H2O)3
* the Zundel cation, which is a symmetric dihydrate, H+(H2O)2
* and the Stoyanov cation, an expanded Zundel cation, which is a hexahydrate: H+(H2O)2(H2O)4 

Spectroscopic evidence from well-defined IR spectra overwhelmingly supports the Stoyanov cation as the predominant form. For this reason, it has been suggested that wherever possible, the symbol H+(aq) should be used instead of the hydronium ion.

==Relation to pH==
The molar concentration of hydronium or ions determines a solution&#x27;s pH according to

:pH = -log([]/M)

where M = mol/L. The concentration of hydroxide ions analogously determines a solution&#x27;s pOH. The molecules in pure water auto-dissociate into aqueous protons and hydroxide ions in the following equilibrium:

In pure water, there is an equal number of hydroxide and ions, so it is a neutral solution. At , pure water has a pH of 7 and a pOH of 7 (this varies when the temperature changes: see self-ionization of water). A pH value less than 7 indicates an acidic solution, and a pH value more than 7 indicates a basic solution.

==Nomenclature==
According to IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry, the hydronium ion should be referred to as &quot;oxonium&quot;. &quot;Hydroxonium&quot; may also be used unambiguously to identify it.

An oxonium ion is any cation containing a trivalent oxygen atom.

==Structure==
Since and N have the same number of electrons, is isoelectronic with ammonia. As shown in the images above, has a trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry with the oxygen atom at its apex. The bond angle is approximately 113°, and the center of mass is very close to the oxygen atom. Because the base of the pyramid is made up of three identical hydrogen atoms, the molecule&#x27;s symmetric top configuration is such that it belongs to the point group. Because of this symmetry and the fact that it has a dipole moment, the rotational selection rules are Δ&quot;J&quot; = ±1 and Δ&quot;K&quot; = 0. The transition dipole lies along the &quot;c&quot;-axis and, because the negative charge is localized near the oxygen atom, the dipole moment points to the apex, perpendicular to the base plane.

==Acids and acidity==
The hydrated proton is very acidic: at 25 °C, its p&quot;K&quot;a is approximately 0. The values commonly given for p&quot;K&quot;aaq(H3O+) are 0 or –1.74. The former uses the convention that the activity of the solvent in a dilute solution (in this case, water) is 1, while the latter uses the value of the concentration of water in the pure liquid of 55.5 M. Silverstein has shown that the latter value is thermodynamically unsupportable. The disagreement comes from the ambiguity that to define p&quot;K&quot;a of H3O+ in water, H2O has to act simultaneously as a solute and the solvent. The IUPAC has not given an official definition of p&quot;K&quot;a that would resolve this ambiguity. Burgot has argued that H3O+(aq) + H2O (l) ⇄ H2O (aq) + H3O+ (aq) is simply not a thermodynamically well-defined process. For an estimate of p&quot;K&quot;aaq(H3O+), Burgot suggests taking the measured value p&quot;K&quot;aEtOH(H3O+) = 0.3, the p&quot;K&quot;a of H3O+ in ethanol, and applying the correlation equation p&quot;K&quot;aaq = p&quot;K&quot;aEtOH – 1.0 (± 0.3) to convert the ethanol p&quot;K&quot;a to an aqueous value, to give a value of p&quot;K&quot;aaq(H3O+) = –0.7 (± 0.3). On the other hand, Silverstein has shown that Ballinger and Long&#x27;s experimental results support a p&quot;K&quot;a of 0.0 for the aqueous proton. Neils and Schaertel provide added arguments for a p&quot;K&quot;a of 0.0 

The aqueous proton is the most acidic species that can exist in water (assuming sufficient water for dissolution): any stronger acid will ionize and yield a hydrated proton. The acidity of (aq) is the implicit standard used to judge the strength of an acid in water: strong acids must be better proton donors than (aq), as otherwise a significant portion of acid will exist in a non-ionized state (i.e.: a weak acid). Unlike (aq) in neutral solutions that result from water&#x27;s autodissociation, in acidic solutions, (aq) is long-lasting and concentrated, in proportion to the strength of the dissolved acid.

pH was originally conceived to be a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration of aqueous solution. Virtually all such free protons are quickly hydrated; acidity of an aqueous solution is therefore more accurately characterized by its concentration of (aq). In organic syntheses, such as acid catalyzed reactions, the hydronium ion () is used interchangeably with the ion; choosing one over the other has no significant effect on the mechanism of reaction.

==Solvation==
Researchers have yet to fully characterize the solvation of hydronium ion in water, in part because many different meanings of solvation exist. A freezing-point depression study determined that the mean hydration ion in cold water is approximately : on average, each hydronium ion is solvated by 6 water molecules which are unable to solvate other solute molecules.

Some hydration structures are quite large: the magic ion number structure (called &quot;magic number&quot; because of its increased stability with respect to hydration structures involving a comparable number of water molecules – this is a similar usage of the term &quot;magic number&quot; as in nuclear physics) might place the hydronium inside a dodecahedral cage. However, more recent ab initio method molecular dynamics simulations have shown that, on average, the hydrated proton resides on the surface of the cluster. Further, several disparate features of these simulations agree with their experimental counterparts suggesting an alternative interpretation of the experimental results.

Two other well-known structures are the &quot;Zundel cation&quot; and the &quot;Eigen cation&quot;. The Eigen solvation structure has the hydronium ion at the center of an complex in which the hydronium is strongly hydrogen-bonded to three neighbouring water molecules. In the Zundel complex the proton is shared equally by two water molecules in a symmetric hydrogen bond. A work in 1999 indicates that both of these complexes represent ideal structures in a more general hydrogen bond network defect.

Isolation of the hydronium ion monomer in liquid phase was achieved in a nonaqueous, low nucleophilicity superacid solution (). The ion was characterized by high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance.

A 2007 calculation of the enthalpies and free energies of the various hydrogen bonds around the hydronium cation in liquid protonated water at room temperature and a study of the proton hopping mechanism using molecular dynamics showed that the hydrogen-bonds around the hydronium ion (formed with the three water ligands in the first solvation shell of the hydronium) are quite strong compared to those of bulk water.

A new model was proposed by Stoyanov based on infrared spectroscopy in which the proton exists as an ion. The positive charge is thus delocalized over 6 water molecules.

==Solid hydronium salts==

For many strong acids, it is possible to form crystals of their hydronium salt that are relatively stable. These salts are sometimes called &quot;acid monohydrates&quot;. As a rule, any acid with an ionization constant of or higher may do this. Acids whose ionization constants are below generally cannot form stable salts. For example, nitric acid has an ionization constant of , and mixtures with water at all proportions are liquid at room temperature. However, perchloric acid has an ionization constant of , and if liquid anhydrous perchloric acid and water are combined in a 1:1 molar ratio, they react to form solid hydronium perchlorate ().

The hydronium ion also forms stable compounds with the carborane superacid . X-ray crystallography shows a symmetry for the hydronium ion with each proton interacting with a bromine atom each from three carborane anions 320 pm apart on average. The salt is also soluble in benzene. In crystals grown from a benzene solution the solvent co-crystallizes and a cation is completely separated from the anion. In the cation three benzene molecules surround hydronium forming pi-cation interactions with the hydrogen atoms. The closest (non-bonding) approach of the anion at chlorine to the cation at oxygen is 348 pm.

There are also many known examples of salts containing hydrated hydronium ions, such as the ion in , the and ions both found in .

Sulfuric acid is also known to form a hydronium salt at temperatures below .

==Interstellar H3O+==

Hydronium is an abundant molecular ion in the interstellar medium and is found in diffuse and dense molecular clouds as well as the plasma tails of comets. Interstellar sources of hydronium observations include the regions of Sagittarius B2, Orion OMC-1, Orion BN–IRc2, Orion KL, and the comet Hale–Bopp.

Interstellar hydronium is formed by a chain of reactions started by the ionization of into by cosmic radiation. can produce either or through dissociative recombination reactions, which occur very quickly even at the low (≥10 K) temperatures of dense clouds. This leads to hydronium playing a very important role in interstellar ion-neutral chemistry.

Astronomers are especially interested in determining the abundance of water in various interstellar climates due to its key role in the cooling of dense molecular gases through radiative processes. However, does not have many favorable transitions for ground-based observations. Although observations of HDO (the deuterated version of water) could potentially be used for estimating abundances, the ratio of HDO to is not known very accurately.

Hydronium, on the other hand, has several transitions that make it a superior candidate for detection and identification in a variety of situations. This information has been used in conjunction with laboratory measurements of the branching ratios of the various dissociative recombination reactions to provide what are believed to be relatively accurate and abundances without requiring direct observation of these species.

===Interstellar chemistry===
As mentioned previously, is found in both diffuse and dense molecular clouds. By applying the reaction rate constants (&quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;, and &quot;γ&quot;) corresponding to all of the currently available characterized reactions involving , it is possible to calculate &quot;k&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) for each of these reactions. By multiplying these &quot;k&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) by the relative abundances of the products, the relative rates (in cm3/s) for each reaction at a given temperature can be determined. These relative rates can be made in absolute rates by multiplying them by the . By assuming for a dense cloud and for a diffuse cloud, the results indicate that most dominant formation and destruction mechanisms were the same for both cases. It should be mentioned that the relative abundances used in these calculations correspond to TMC-1, a dense molecular cloud, and that the calculated relative rates are therefore expected to be more accurate at . The three fastest formation and destruction mechanisms are listed in the table below, along with their relative rates. Note that the rates of these six reactions are such that they make up approximately 99% of hydronium ion&#x27;s chemical interactions under these conditions. All three destruction mechanisms in the table below are classified as dissociative recombination reactions.

It is also worth noting that the relative rates for the formation reactions in the table above are the same for a given reaction at both temperatures. This is due to the reaction rate constants for these reactions having &quot;β&quot; and &quot;γ&quot; constants of 0, resulting in which is independent of temperature.

Since all three of these reactions produce either or OH, these results reinforce the strong connection between their relative abundances and that of . The rates of these six reactions are such that they make up approximately 99% of hydronium ion&#x27;s chemical interactions under these conditions.

===Astronomical detections===
As early as 1973 and before the first interstellar detection, chemical models of the interstellar medium (the first corresponding to a dense cloud) predicted that hydronium was an abundant molecular ion and that it played an important role in ion-neutral chemistry. However, before an astronomical search could be underway there was still the matter of determining hydronium&#x27;s spectroscopic features in the gas phase, which at this point were unknown. The first studies of these characteristics came in 1977, which was followed by other, higher resolution spectroscopy experiments. Once several lines had been identified in the laboratory, the first interstellar detection of H3O+ was made by two groups almost simultaneously in 1986. The first, published in June 1986, reported observation of the &quot;J&quot; = 1 − 2 transition at in OMC-1 and Sgr B2. The second, published in August, reported observation of the same transition toward the Orion-KL nebula.

These first detections have been followed by observations of a number of additional transitions. The first observations of each subsequent transition detection are given below in chronological order:

In 1991, the 3 − 2 transition at was observed in OMC-1 and Sgr B2. One year later, the 3 − 2 transition at was observed in several regions, the clearest of which was the W3 IRS 5 cloud.

The first far-IR 4 − 3 transition at 69.524 μm (4.3121 THz) was made in 1996 near Orion BN-IRc2. In 2001, three additional transitions of in were observed in the far infrared in Sgr B2; 2 − 1 transition at 100.577 μm (2.98073 THz), 1 − 1 at 181.054 μm (1.65582 THz) and 2 − 1 at 100.869 μm (2.9721 THz).

<doc id="49284" wikidata="Q204121" url="?curid=49284" title="Methylchloroisothiazolinone">
<text>Methylchloroisothiazolinone, also referred to as MCI, is the organic compound with the formula S(C2HCl)C(O)N(CH3). It is a white solid that melts near room temperature. The compound is an isothiazolinone, a class of heterocycles used as biocides. These compounds have an active sulphur moiety that is able to oxidize thiol-containing residues, thereby effectively killing most aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. MCI is often used in combination with methylisothiazolinone, a mixture known as Kathon. The isothiazolinones have attracted attention because they can cause contact dermatitis. Methylchloroisothiazolinone is effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeast, and fungi.

== Application ==
Methylchloroisothiazolinone is found in many water-based personal care products and cosmetics. Methylchloroisothiazolinone was first used in cosmetics in the 1970s. It is also used in glue production, detergents, paints, fuels, and other industrial processes. Methylchloroisothiazolinone is known by the registered tradename &quot;Kathon&quot; CG when used in combination with methylisothiazolinone.

Methylchloroisothiazolinone may be used in combination with other preservatives including ethylparaben, benzalkonium chloride, bronopol and phenoxyethanol.

== Hazards ==
Methylchloroisothiazolinone can cause allergic reactions in some people. The first publication of the preservative as a contact allergen was in 1988. Cases of photoaggravated allergic contact dermatitis, i.e. worsening of skin lesions after sun exposure, have also been reported.

In pure form or in high concentrations, methylchloroisothiazolinone is a skin and membrane irritant and causes chemical burns. In the United States, maximum authorized concentrations are 15 ppm in rinse-offs (of a mixture in the ratio 3:1 of 5-chloro-2-methylisothiazol 3(2H)-one and 2-methylisothiazol-3 (2H)-one). In Canada, methylchloroisothiazolinone may only be used in rinse-off products in combination with methylisothiazolinone, the total concentration of the combination may not exceed 15 ppm.

Methylisothiazolinone is considered safe in the allowed amount in rinse-off products (0.1%) and safe in leave-in products when formulated to be non-sensitizing.

An overdose of Kathon by aircraft maintenance personnel, using 38 times the correct amount, resulted in damage to both engines of a Titan Airways aircraft in February 2020. After losing both engines in succession, the Airbus A321 made an emergency landing at London Gatwick Airport. The maintenance procedures specified the Kathon to be diluted to 100 PPM by volume, but with the aircraft maintenance technician being unfamiliar with the term &quot;PPM&quot; and the term not being defined in the aircraft maintenance manuals, the technician instead used an online calculator to convert PPM to percentages, misinterpreted the answer, and added 30 kg of Kathon to each wing tank, which was over 38 times the required amount. Over the course of the next day, the Kathon progressively caused more and more damage to the engines, finally resulting in an emergency landing.

<text>USS &quot;Winston S. Churchill&quot; (DDG-81) is the 31st &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight IIA) Aegis guided missile destroyer of the United States Navy. She is named after Sir Winston Churchill, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. She is the 18th ship of the class to be built at Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine. Construction began on 7 May 1998, and the vessel launched and christened on 17 April 1999. On 10 March 2001, she was commissioned during a ceremony at Town Point Park in Norfolk, Virginia.
== Naming ==

On 29 November 1995, on a visit to the United Kingdom, President Bill Clinton announced to their Parliament that the new ship would be named after Sir Winston Churchill, a former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. She was the first destroyer and only the fourth U.S. Navy warship named after a British citizen, and the first since 1976 named after a non-U.S. citizen (that being ), though Churchill was an honorary U.S. citizen and his mother was American.

Other U.S. warships named after Britons were , an armed merchantman named after King Alfred the Great; , a continental frigate, named after Sir Walter Raleigh (though three later USS &quot;Raleigh&quot;s—and two Confederate warships—would be named after the North Carolina city, which did not exist at the time); and , named after The 3rd Earl of Effingham who resigned his commission rather than fight the colonists during the American Revolutionary War. The former frigate was also named after a person from a country in the Commonwealth of Nations, Harold Holt, the Australian Prime Minister, who disappeared, (presumed drowned), while still in office just a year before &quot;Harold E. Holt&quot; was laid down. &quot;Winston S. Churchill&quot; is the first ship to be named after a British citizen or British Prime Minister of the modern era.

&quot;Winston S. Churchill&quot; is the only U.S. Navy vessel to have a Royal Navy exchange officer permanently assigned to the ship&#x27;s company (usually a Navigation Officer). The U.S. Navy had a permanent U.S. Navy Officer on the Royal Navy ship, , until her decommissioning on 8 July 2005. &quot;Winston S. Churchill&quot; is also the only U.S. Naval vessel to fly a foreign ensign. Being named after a Briton, the Royal Navy&#x27;s White Ensign is honorarily flown on special occasions from the ship&#x27;s mast, on the port side, whereas the U.S. flag is flown from the starboard side. However, during normal operations, only the U.S. flag is flown on the center of the main mast.

==Design==
The ship is the first of the Flight IIA variants fitted with the 62-caliber Mark 45 Mod 4 naval gun system. The guns&#x27; longer barrels allow more complete combustion of the propellant, reducing barrel flare and improving projectile velocity and firepower against ship and shore targets; additionally, the Mk 45 mod 4 uses a modified gun-house, designed to reduce its radar signature. &quot;Winston S. Churchill&quot; is armed with Tomahawk, Standard and ASROC (VLA) missiles.

The vessel additionally contains two hangars, not present in earlier destroyers; these can house Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) Sikorsky SH-60B or MH-60R Seahawk helicopters. These LAMPS can be fitted with air-to-surface missiles for surface ship attacks, and torpedoes for submarine attacks.

The ship is also fitted with the AN/SPY-1D phased array radar—this represents a significant advancement in the detection capabilities of the Aegis weapon system and provides enhanced resistance to electronic countermeasures. The radar can guide more than one hundred missiles at once to targets as far as .

== Service history ==
The contract to build &quot;Winston S. Churchill&quot; was awarded to the Bath Iron Works Corporation on 6 January 1995, and the keel was laid down on 7 May 1998. &quot;Winston S. Churchill&quot; was launched on 17 April 1999, delivered 13 October 2000, and commissioned 10 March 2001. The launch and christening of the ship was co-sponsored by Lady Soames, the daughter of Winston Churchill, and Mrs. Janet Cohen, wife of the Secretary of Defense. Her first commanding officer was Commander (and future Vice Admiral) Michael T. Franken.

During May–June 2001, &quot;Winston S. Churchill&quot; underwent shock trials 100 nautical miles off the coast of Naval Station Mayport, Florida. These trials subjected the ship to various close-range underwater detonations, and were performed to collect data concerning ship survivability and damage resistance in a modern threat environment. &quot;Winston S. Churchill&quot; sustained minor damage during these three tests. The tests costed 20 million dollars. 

On 14 September 2001, (three days after the 11 September 2001 attacks), the German Navy destroyer passed close abeam &quot;Winston S. Churchill&quot; and rendered honors by manning the rails, flying the Stars and Stripes at half-mast, and the display of a banner reading &quot;We Stand By You&quot;. An e-mail sent by an ensign on board &quot;Winston S. Churchill&quot; described the occasion.

In January 2003, &quot;Winston S. Churchill&quot; deployed with the battle group in support of the Iraq War&#x27;s Operation Iraqi Freedom, firing several Tomahawk missiles. &quot;Winston S. Churchill&quot; returned to Norfolk at the end of May 2003.
On 22 August 2005, &quot;Winston S. Churchill&quot; was involved in a minor collision with the destroyer off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida. Both ships suffered minor damage, and no injuries were reported. Both ships returned to their homeport at Naval Station Norfolk under their own power.
On 22 January 2006 &quot;Winston S. Churchill&quot; captured a suspected pirate vessel in the Indian Ocean as part of an ongoing effort to help maintain law and order in the region.

On 26 September 2010, &quot;Winston S. Churchill&quot; came across a disabled skiff in the Gulf of Aden. After attempts to repair the skiff&#x27;s engines failed &quot;Winston S. Churchill&quot; took the vessel under tow towards Somalia. On 27 September the skiff sank when the 85 passengers rushed to one side of the skiff during a food delivery causing the vessel to capsize. &quot;Winston S. Churchill&quot; was able to rescue 61 of the passengers and continued towards Somalia on 28 September.

Her homeport was formerly Naval Station Norfolk became Naval Station Mayport, Florida on 19 July 2021. She is currently a part of Carrier Strike Group 12.

On 11–12 February 2021, &quot;Winston S. Churchill&quot; seized thousands of weapons from two stateless dhows off the coast of Somalia.

==Coat of arms==

=== Shield ===
The shield features an inescutcheon of his ancestral coat of arms and the cross of St. George. The traditional Navy colors were chosen for the shield because dark blue and gold represents the sea and excellence respectively. Red signifies sacrifice and valor. The cross of St. George and the fleur-de-lis are from Churchill&#x27;s augmentation from his ancestor&#x27;s coat of arms. The red cross on the white field is a reference to the flag of St. George. The gold lion over the field of red is a reference to the heritage of Great Britain. The lion shows strength, courage and determination. The nebuly is representative to the sky and clouds, which recall Britain enduring German airpower in the Battle of Britain. Winston Churchill&#x27;s reputation of an inspiring war leader, talented statesman, orator and author is referred to by the stylized book.

=== Crest ===
The crest consists of a trident encompassed by a chevron, laurel and oak. The trident is a symbol for sea prowess and represents the ship&#x27;s vertical launch capabilities. The tridents tines denote air, surface, and anti-submarine warfare capabilities. A chevron divides the trident which suggests a &quot;V&quot; to signify victory in way and strength of defense in peace. The laurel symbolizes honor and achievement while the oak represents strength and resolve.

=== Motto ===
The motto is written on a double scroll of red that has a white reverse side. The ship&#x27;s motto, &quot;In war: Resolution. In peace: Good Will&quot;, is taken from the epigraph of Churchill&#x27;s The Second World War.

=== Seal ===
The coat of arms in full color as in the blazon, upon a white background enclosed within a dark blue oval border edged on the outside with a gold rope and bearing the inscription &quot;USS Winston S. Churchill&quot; at the top and &quot;DDG 81&quot; in the base all gold.

<doc id="49295" wikidata="Q5997" url="?curid=49295" title="Fine-structure constant">
<text>In physics, the fine-structure constant, also known as the Sommerfeld constant, commonly denoted by (the Greek letter &quot;alpha&quot;), is a fundamental physical constant that quantifies the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between elementary charged particles.

It is a dimensionless quantity (dimensionless physical constant), independent of the system of units used, which is related to the strength of the coupling of an elementary charge &quot;e&quot; with the electromagnetic field, by the formula . Its numerical value is approximately , with a relative uncertainty of 

The constant was named by Arnold Sommerfeld, who introduced it in 1916 when extending the Bohr model of the atom. quantified the gap in the fine structure of the spectral lines of the hydrogen atom, which had been measured precisely by Michelson and Morley in 1887.

Why the constant should have this value is not understood, but there are a number of ways to measure its value.

== Definition ==
In terms of other physical constants, may be defined as:
formula_1
where
* is the elementary charge ();
* is the Planck constant ();
* is the reduced Planck constant, ()
* is the speed of light ();
* is the electric constant ().

Since the 2019 revision of the SI, the only quantity in this list that does not have an exact value in SI units is the electric constant (vacuum permittivity).

=== Alternative systems of units ===
The electrostatic CGS system implicitly sets , as commonly found in older physics literature, where the expression of the fine-structure constant becomes
formula_2

A nondimensionalised system commonly used in high energy physics sets , where the expression for the fine-structure constant becomesformula_3As such, the fine-structure constant is chiefly a quantity determining (or determined by) the elementary charge: in terms of such a natural unit of charge.

In the system of atomic units, which sets , the expression for the fine-structure constant becomes
formula_4

== Measurement ==

The CODATA recommended value of is
 This has a relative standard uncertainty of 

This value for gives , 0.8 times the standard uncertainty away from its old defined value, with the mean differing from the old value by only 0.13 parts per billion.

Historically the value of the reciprocal of the fine-structure constant is often given. The CODATA recommended value is 
While the value of can be determined from estimates of the constants that appear in any of its definitions, the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a way to measure directly using the quantum Hall effect or the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. Other methods include the A.C. Josephson effect and photon recoil in atom interferometry.
There is general agreement for the value of , as measured by these different methods. The preferred methods in 2019 are measurements of electron anomalous magnetic moments and of photon recoil in atom interferometry. The theory of QED predicts a relationship between the dimensionless magnetic moment of the electron and the fine-structure constant (the magnetic moment of the electron is also referred to as the electron -factor ). One of the most precise values of obtained experimentally (as of 2023) is based on a measurement of using a one-electron so-called &quot;quantum cyclotron&quot; apparatus, together with a calculation via the theory of QED that involved tenth-order Feynman diagrams:
This measurement of has a relative standard uncertainty of . This value and uncertainty are about the same as the latest experimental results.

Further refinement of the experimental value was published by the end of 2020, giving the value

with a relative accuracy of , which has a significant discrepancy from the previous experimental value.

== Physical interpretations ==
The fine-structure constant, , has several physical interpretations. is: = \frac{e^2}{ 4 \pi \varepsilon_0 \hbar c } .&lt;/math&gt;}}

| The ratio of the velocity of the electron in the first circular orbit of the Bohr model of the atom, which is , to the speed of light in vacuum, . This is Sommerfeld&#x27;s original physical interpretation. Then the square of is the ratio between the Hartree energy ( approximately twice its ionization energy) and the electron rest energy (511 keV).
| formula_5 is the ratio of the potential energy of the electron in the first circular orbit of the Bohr model of the atom and the energy equivalent to the mass of an electron. Using the virial theorem in the Bohr model of the atom formula_6 which means that formula_7 Essentially this ratio follows from the electron&#x27;s velocity being formula_8.

| The two ratios of three characteristic lengths: the classical electron radius , the reduced Compton wavelength of the electron , and the Bohr radius : .

| In quantum electrodynamics, is directly related to the coupling constant determining the strength of the interaction between electrons and photons. The theory does not predict its value. Therefore, must be determined experimentally. In fact, is one of the empirical parameters in the Standard Model of particle physics, whose value is not determined within the Standard Model.

| In the electroweak theory unifying the weak interaction with electromagnetism, is absorbed into two other coupling constants associated with the electroweak gauge fields. In this theory, the electromagnetic interaction is treated as a mixture of interactions associated with the electroweak fields. The strength of the electromagnetic interaction varies with the strength of the energy field.

| In the fields of electrical engineering and solid-state physics, the fine-structure constant is one fourth the product of the characteristic impedance of free space, formula_9 and the conductance quantum, formula_10: formula_11 The optical conductivity of graphene for visible frequencies is theoretically given by , and as a result its light absorption and transmission properties can be expressed in terms of the fine-structure constant alone. The absorption value for normal-incident light on graphene in vacuum would then be given by or 2.24%, and the transmission by or 97.75% (experimentally observed to be between 97.6% and 97.8%). The reflection would then be given by .

| The fine-structure constant gives the maximum positive charge of an atomic nucleus that will allow a stable electron-orbit around it within the Bohr model (element feynmanium). For an electron orbiting an atomic nucleus with atomic number the relation is . The Heisenberg uncertainty principle momentum/position uncertainty relationship of such an electron is just . The relativistic limiting value for is , and so the limiting value for is the reciprocal of the fine-structure constant, 137.

When perturbation theory is applied to quantum electrodynamics, the resulting perturbative expansions for physical results are expressed as sets of power series in . Because is much less than one, higher powers of are soon unimportant, making the perturbation theory practical in this case. On the other hand, the large value of the corresponding factors in quantum chromodynamics makes calculations involving the strong nuclear force extremely difficult.

== Variation with energy scale ==
In quantum electrodynamics, the more thorough quantum field theory underlying the electromagnetic coupling, the renormalization group dictates how the strength of the electromagnetic interaction grows logarithmically as the relevant energy scale increases. The value of the fine-structure constant is linked to the observed value of this coupling associated with the energy scale of the electron mass: the electron&#x27;s mass gives a lower bound for this energy scale, because it (and the positron) is the lightest charged object whose quantum loops can contribute to the running. Therefore, is the asymptotic value of the fine-structure constant at zero energy. 
At higher energies, such as the scale of the Z boson, about 90 GeV, one instead measures an &quot;effective&quot; ≈ 1/127.

As the energy scale increases, the strength of the electromagnetic interaction in the Standard Model approaches that of the other two fundamental interactions, a feature important for grand unification theories. If quantum electrodynamics were an exact theory, the fine-structure constant would actually diverge at an energy known as the Landau pole – this fact undermines the consistency of quantum electrodynamics beyond perturbative expansions.

== History ==

Based on the precise measurement of the hydrogen atom spectrum by Michelson and Morley in 1887, 
Arnold Sommerfeld extended the Bohr model to include elliptical orbits and relativistic dependence of mass on velocity. He introduced a term for the fine-structure constant in 1916.
The first physical interpretation of the fine-structure constant was as the ratio of the velocity of the electron in the first circular orbit of the relativistic Bohr atom to the speed of light in the vacuum.
Equivalently, it was the quotient between the minimum angular momentum allowed by relativity for a closed orbit, and the minimum angular momentum allowed for it by quantum mechanics. It appears naturally in Sommerfeld&#x27;s analysis, and determines the size of the splitting or fine-structure of the hydrogenic spectral lines. This constant was not seen as significant until Paul Dirac&#x27;s linear relativistic wave equation in 1928, which gave the exact fine structure formula.

With the development of quantum electrodynamics (QED) the significance of has broadened from a spectroscopic phenomenon to a general coupling constant for the electromagnetic field, determining the strength of the interaction between electrons and photons. The term is engraved on the tombstone of one of the pioneers of QED, Julian Schwinger, referring to his calculation of the anomalous magnetic dipole moment.

=== History of measurements ===
The CODATA values in the above table are computed by averaging other measurements; they are not independent experiments.

== Potential variation over time ==

Physicists have pondered whether the fine-structure constant is in fact constant, or whether its value differs by location and over time. A varying has been proposed as a way of solving problems in cosmology and astrophysics. String theory and other proposals for going beyond the Standard Model of particle physics have led to theoretical interest in whether the accepted physical constants (not just ) actually vary.

In the experiments below, represents the change in over time, which can be computed by prev − now . If the fine-structure constant really is a constant, then any experiment should show that
formula_12
or as close to zero as experiment can measure. Any value far away from zero would indicate that does change over time. So far, most experimental data is consistent with being constant.

=== Past rate of change ===
The first experimenters to test whether the fine-structure constant might actually vary examined the spectral lines of distant astronomical objects and the products of radioactive decay in the Oklo natural nuclear fission reactor. Their findings were consistent with no variation in the fine-structure constant between these two vastly separated locations and times.

Improved technology at the dawn of the 21st century made it possible to probe the value of at much larger distances and to a much greater accuracy. In 1999, a team led by John K. Webb of the University of New South Wales claimed the first detection of a variation in .
Using the Keck telescopes and a data set of 128 quasars at redshifts , Webb &quot;et al.&quot; found that their spectra were consistent with a slight increase in over the last 10–12 billion years. Specifically, they found that

In other words, they measured the value to be somewhere between and . This is a very small value, but the error bars do not actually include zero. This result either indicates that is not constant or that there is experimental error unaccounted for.

In 2004, a smaller study of 23 absorption systems by Chand &quot;et al.&quot;, using the Very Large Telescope, found no measurable variation:
formula_14

However, in 2007 simple flaws were identified in the analysis method of Chand &quot;et al.&quot;, discrediting those results.

King &quot;et al.&quot; have used Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to investigate the algorithm used by the UNSW group to determine from the quasar spectra, and have found that the algorithm appears to produce correct uncertainties and maximum likelihood estimates for for particular models. This suggests that the statistical uncertainties and best estimate for stated by Webb &quot;et al.&quot; and Murphy &quot;et al.&quot; are robust.

Lamoreaux and Torgerson analyzed data from the Oklo natural nuclear fission reactor in 2004, and concluded that has changed in the past 2 billion years by 45 parts per billion. They claimed that this finding was &quot;probably accurate to within 20%&quot;. Accuracy is dependent on estimates of impurities and temperature in the natural reactor. These conclusions have yet to be verified.

In 2007, Khatri and Wandelt of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign realized that the 21 cm hyperfine transition in neutral hydrogen of the early universe leaves a unique absorption line imprint in the cosmic microwave background radiation.
They proposed using this effect to measure the value of during the epoch before the formation of the first stars. In principle, this technique provides enough information to measure a variation of 1 part in (4 orders of magnitude better than the current quasar constraints). However, the constraint which can be placed on is strongly dependent upon effective integration time, going as . The European LOFAR radio telescope would only be able to constrain to about 0.3%. The collecting area required to constrain to the current level of quasar constraints is on the order of 100 square kilometers, which is economically impracticable at present.

=== Present rate of change ===
In 2008, Rosenband &quot;et al.&quot;
used the frequency ratio of and in single-ion optical atomic clocks to place a very stringent constraint on the present-time temporal variation of , namely = per year. A present day null constraint on the time variation of alpha does not necessarily rule out time variation in the past. Indeed, some theories
that predict a variable fine-structure constant also predict that the value of the fine-structure constant should become practically fixed in its value once the universe enters its current dark energy-dominated epoch.

=== Spatial variation – Australian dipole ===
Researchers from Australia have said they had identified a variation of the fine-structure constant across the observable universe.

These results have not been replicated by other researchers. In September and October 2010, after released research by Webb &quot;et al.&quot;, physicists C. Orzel and S.M. Carroll separately suggested various approaches of how Webb&#x27;s observations may be wrong. Orzel argues
that the study may contain wrong data due to subtle differences in the two telescopes
a totally different approach; he looks at the fine-structure constant as a scalar field and claims that if the telescopes are correct and the fine-structure constant varies smoothly over the universe, then the scalar field must have a very small mass. However, previous research has shown that the mass is not likely to be extremely small. Both of these scientists&#x27; early criticisms point to the fact that different techniques are needed to confirm or contradict the results, a conclusion Webb, &quot;et al&quot;., previously stated in their study.

Other research finds no meaningful variation in the fine structure constant.

== Anthropic explanation ==
The anthropic principle is an argument about the reason the fine-structure constant has the value it does: stable matter, and therefore life and intelligent beings, could not exist if its value were very different. One example is that, if modern grand unified theories are correct, then needs to be between around 1/180 and 1/85 to have proton decay to be slow enough for life to be possible.

== Numerological explanations ==
As a dimensionless constant which does not seem to be directly related to any mathematical constant, the fine-structure constant has long fascinated physicists.

Arthur Eddington argued that the value could be &quot;obtained by pure deduction&quot; and he related it to the Eddington number, his estimate of the number of protons in the universe.
This led him in 1929 to conjecture that the reciprocal of the fine-structure constant was not approximately but precisely the integer 137.
By the 1940s experimental values for deviated sufficiently from 137 to refute Eddington&#x27;s arguments.

Physicist Wolfgang Pauli commented on the appearance of certain numbers in physics, including the fine-structure constant, which he also noted approximates reciprocal of the prime number 137. This constant so intrigued him that he collaborated with psychoanalyst Carl Jung in a quest to understand its significance. Similarly, Max Born believed that if the value of differed, the universe would degenerate, and thus that = is a law of nature.

Richard Feynman, one of the originators and early developers of the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED), referred to the fine-structure constant in these terms:

Conversely, statistician I. J. Good argued that a numerological explanation would only be acceptable if it could be based on a good theory that is not yet known but &quot;exists&quot; in the sense of a Platonic Ideal.

Attempts to find a mathematical basis for this dimensionless constant have continued up to the present time. However, no numerological explanation has ever been accepted by the physics community.

In the late 20th century, multiple physicists, including Stephen Hawking in his 1988 book &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot;, began exploring the idea of a multiverse, and the fine-structure constant was one of several universal constants that suggested the idea of a fine-tuned universe.

<text>Haidinger&#x27;s brush, more commonly known as Haidinger&#x27;s brushes is an image produced by the eye, an entoptic phenomenon, first described by Austrian physicist Wilhelm Karl von Haidinger in 1844. Haidinger saw it when he looked through various minerals that polarized light.

Many people are able to perceive polarization of light. Haidinger&#x27;s brushes may be seen as a yellowish horizontal bar or bow-tie shape (with &quot;fuzzy&quot; ends, hence the name &quot;brush&quot;) visible in the center of the visual field against the blue sky viewed while facing away from the sun, or on any bright background. It typically occupies roughly 3–5 degrees of vision, about twice or three times the width of one&#x27;s thumb held at arm&#x27;s length. The direction of light polarization is perpendicular to the yellow bar (i.e., vertical if the bar is horizontal). Fainter bluish or purplish areas may be visible between the yellow brushes (see illustration). Haidinger&#x27;s brush may also be seen by looking at a white area on many LCD flat panel computer screens (due to the polarization effect of the display), in which case it is often diagonal.

==Physiological causes==
Haidinger&#x27;s brush is usually attributed to the dichroism of the xanthophyll pigment found in the macula lutea. As described by the Fresnel laws, the behavior and distribution of oblique rays in the cylindrical geometry of the foveal blue cones produce an extrinsic dichroism. The size of the brush is consistent with the size of the macula.

It is thought that the macula&#x27;s dichroism arises from some of its pigment molecules being arranged circularly; (the small proportion of circularly arranged molecules accounts for the faintness of the phenomenon.) Xanthophyll pigments tend to be parallel to visive nerves that (because the fovea is not flat), are almost orthogonal to the fovea in its central part but nearly parallel in its outer region. As a result, two different areas of the fovea can be sensitive to two different degrees of polarization.

==Seeing Haidinger&#x27;s brush==
Many people find it difficult to see Haidinger&#x27;s brush initially. It is very faint, much more so than generally indicated in illustrations, and, like other stabilized images, tends to appear and disappear.

It is most easily seen when it can be made to move. Because it is always positioned on the macula, there is no way to make it move laterally, but it can be made to rotate, by viewing a white surface through a rotating polarizer, or by slowly tilting one&#x27;s head to one side.

To see Haidinger&#x27;s brush, start by using a polarizer, such as a lens from a pair of polarizing sunglasses. Gaze at an evenly lit, textureless surface through the lens and rotate the polarizer.

An option is to use the polarizer built into a computer&#x27;s LCD screen. Look at a white area on the screen, and slowly tilt the head (this method generally works only with LCDs, as most other electronic visual display technologies do not emit polarized light).

It appears with more distinctness against a blue background. With practice, it is possible to see it in the naturally polarized light of a blue sky. Minnaert recommended practicing first with a polarizer, then trying it without. The areas of the sky with the strongest polarization are those 90 degrees away from the sun. Minnaert said that after a minute of gazing at the sky, &quot;a kind of marble effect will appear. This is followed shortly by Haidinger&#x27;s brush.&quot; He commented that not all observers see it in the same way. Some see the yellow pattern as solid and the blue pattern as interrupted, as in the illustrations on this page. Some see the blue as solid and the yellow as interrupted, and some see it alternating between the two states.

==Use==
The fact that the sensation of Haidinger&#x27;s brush corresponds with the visual field of the macula means that it can be utilised in training people to look at objects with their macula. People with certain types of strabismus may undergo an adaptation whereupon they look at the object of attention not with their fovea (at the centre of the macula) but with an eccentric region of the retina. This adaptation is known as eccentric fixation. To aid in training a person to look at an object with their fovea rather than their eccentric retinal zone, a training device can be used. One such apparatus utilises a rotating polarised plate backlit with a bright white light. Wearing blue spectacles (to enhance the Haidinger&#x27;s brush image) and an over the other eye, the user will hopefully notice the Haidinger&#x27;s brush where their macula correlates with their visual field. The goal of the training is for the user to learn to look at the test object in such a way that the Haidinger&#x27;s brush overlaps the test object (and the viewer is thus now looking at it with their fovea). The reason for such training is that the healthy fovea is far greater in its resolving power than any other part of the retina. Another diagnostic method that utilises birefringent properties of the retinal tissue is retinal birefringence scanning, that can be used in case of severe amblyopia or when the specialist lacks a cooperation from the patient.

<text>Nellie Davis Ross (née Tayloe; November 29, 1876 – December 19, 1977) was an American educator and politician who served as the 14th governor of Wyoming from 1925 to 1927, and as the 28th and first female director of the United States Mint from 1933 to 1953. She was the first woman to serve as governor of a U.S. state, and remains the only woman to have served as governor of Wyoming. She was a Democrat and supported Prohibition. She ran for re-election but refused to campaign herself.

Ross was born in St. Joseph, Missouri, to James Wynns Tayloe, a native of Tennessee, and Elizabeth Blair Green, who owned a plantation on the Missouri River. Her family moved to Miltonvale, Kansas in 1884, and she graduated from Miltonvale High School in 1892. She attended a teacher-training college for two years and taught kindergarten for four years.

On September 11, 1902, Ross married William B. Ross, whom she had met when visiting relatives in Tennessee in 1900. William B. Ross was governor of Wyoming from 1923 to his death on October 2, 1924. Ross succeeded her late husband&#x27;s successor Frank Lucas as governor when she won the special election, becoming the first female American governor on January 5, 1925. She was a staunch supporter of Prohibition during the 1920s. She lost re-election in 1926, but remained an active member of the Democratic Party.

In 1933, Ross became the first female Director of the United States Mint. Despite initial mistrust, she forged a strong bond with Mary Margaret O&#x27;Reilly, the assistant director of the Mint and one of the United States&#x27; highest-ranking female civil servants of her time. Ross served five terms as Director, retiring in 1953. During her later years, she wrote for various women&#x27;s magazines and traveled. Ross died in Washington, D. C., at the age of 101.

== Early life and education ==
Born Nellie Davis Tayloe in St. Joseph, Missouri, Ross was the sixth child, and first daughter, of James Wynns Tayloe, a native of Stewart County, Tennessee, and his wife, Elizabeth Blair Green, who owned a plantation on the Missouri River. She spent much of her childhood in the Florence and Decatur in northern Alabama&#x27;s Tennessee Valley. In 1884, when Ross was seven years of age, her family moved to Miltonvale in Cloud County in northern Kansas. This relocation happened after her father&#x27;s old family home back in St. Joseph burned, and the sheriff was about to foreclose on the property.

After Ross graduated from Miltonville High School in 1892, her family moved to Omaha, Nebraska. During this time, she taught private piano lessons and attended a two-year training program for kindergarten teachers that was sponsored by the Omaha city school system. She then taught kindergarten for four years. Two of her brothers sent her on a trip to Europe in 1896.

While on a visit to her relatives in Dover, Tennessee, in 1900, Ross met William Bradford Ross, whom she married on September 11, 1902. They had three children (twins James Ambrose and George Taylor, and Alfred Duff). William Ross practiced law and planned to live in the American West. He moved to Cheyenne and established a law practice, bringing his wife to join him. Ross became a leader in Wyoming&#x27;s Democratic Party served as Laramie County&#x27;s prosecuting attorney from 1906 to 1907. In 1910 he was an unsuccessful candidate for Wyoming&#x27;s at-large congressional seat, and in 1918 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor.

== Governorship of Wyoming ==
In 1922, William Ross was elected governor of Wyoming by appealing to progressive voters in both parties. However, after little more than a year and a half in office, he died on October 2, 1924, from surgical complications following an appendectomy. The Democratic Party then nominated his widow, Nellie, to run for governor in a special election the following month.

Nellie Ross refused to campaign. She won the November 4, 1924, election with 43,323 votes (55.12%) against her opponent&#x27;s 35,275 votes (44.88%). On January 5, 1925, she became the first female governor in the history of the United States. As governor she continued her late husband&#x27;s policies, which called for tax cuts, government assistance for poor farmers, banking reform, and laws protecting children, women workers, and miners. She urged Wyoming to ratify a pending federal amendment prohibiting child labor. Like her husband, she advocated the strengthening of prohibition laws.

Ross ran for re-election in 1926, and relied on campaign surrogates including Cecilia Hennel Hendricks, the Democratic nominee for State Superintendent of Public Instruction, but was narrowly defeated by Frank Emerson. She attributed her loss in part to her refusal to campaign for herself and support for prohibition. She remained active in the Democratic Party and campaigned for Al Smith in the 1928 presidential election, even though the two disagreed on prohibition. At the 1928 Democratic National Convention, she received 33 votes from eleven states for vice president on the first ballot. She also gave a speech seconding Smith&#x27;s nomination. After the convention, she served as vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee and as director of the DNC Women&#x27;s Division.

== Director of U.S. Mint ==
=== Appointment by FDR ===
U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Ross as director of the U.S. Mint on May 3, 1933, making her the first woman to hold that position. Ross and the Mint&#x27;s Assistant Director Mary Margaret O&#x27;Reilly, &quot;the Sweetheart of the Treasury&quot; who had worked at the Mint since 1904, had mutual suspicions to overcome. Ross, who had endured poor relations with Eleanor Roosevelt and others on FDR&#x27;s campaign, did not trust the career staff. O&#x27;Reilly saw another political appointee with no experience at the Mint Bureau replacing Robert J. Grant, who had been Denver Mint superintendent before his directorship. After a brief period, the two women came to appreciate each other&#x27;s merits.

=== Tenure ===
Ross and O&#x27;Reilly soon came to the usual division of labor between director and assistant: the director would handle public affairs and make policy decisions as needed, while the assistant dealt with the day-to-day business of the bureau. Ross undertook a heavy travel schedule, visiting Mint facilities, making speeches backing Roosevelt, and campaigning for Democratic candidates in Wyoming. This left O&#x27;Reilly running the Washington office as acting director. The two women carried on a businesslike but warm correspondence during these times, with O&#x27;Reilly writing to Ross (who had embarked on a tour of the mints) &quot;I am so anxious to have your mind at ease about the office here [in Washington] that I have resorted to rather frequent telegrams. They are so much more direct and up to date than letters ... my love to you and every good wish for the success of your visits to our beloved mint institutions.&quot; Teva J. Scheer, biographer of Ross, suggests that O&#x27;Reilly would have found Ross&#x27;s reports from the field valuable; they showed how the Mint recovered from the initial years of the Depression, when relatively few coins were produced, to the mid-1930s, when strong demand for coinage led the bureau to run the mints with two or even three shifts.

=== O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s retirement ===
In 1935, O&#x27;Reilly reached the mandatory federal retirement age of 70. Ross requested that President Roosevelt exempt O&#x27;Reilly from mandatory retirement because her knowledge of bureau affairs was so extensive and was badly needed. A special order of President Roosevelt gave O&#x27;Reilly an extra year in the Mint Service. During the extension, Ross hired Frank Leland Howard of the University of Virginia, who had a background in accounting, as O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s prospective replacement. Howard replaced O&#x27;Reilly when she retired on October 29, 1938, after two more extensions.

=== Legacy ===
Ross&#x27; tenure saw the Mint in 1944 investigate how several 1933 double eagles, never officially released, had come onto the market. She is known for establishing the Franklin half dollar and starting the making of proof coins for public sale. Ross served five full terms until her retirement in 1953 and was succeeded by William H. Brett, whom President Dwight D. Eisenhower nominated in 1954.

== Later years and death ==
After her retirement, Ross contributed articles to various women&#x27;s magazines and traveled extensively. She made her last trip to Wyoming in 1972 at the age of ninety-six. Five years later, she died in Washington, D.C., at the age of 101; at the time of her death, she was the oldest ex-governor in the United States. She is interred in the family plot in Lakeview Cemetery in Cheyenne.

<text>Isabella (, ; c. 1186/ 1188 – 4 June 1246) was Queen of England from 1200 to 1216 as the second wife of King John, Countess of Angoulême in her own right from 1202 until her death in 1246, and Countess of La Marche from 1220 to 1246 as the wife of Count Hugh.

Isabella was the only child of Aymer, Count of Angoulême, and Alice of Courtenay. In 1200, she married King John, with whom she had five children, including the future Henry III of England. After John died in 1216, Isabella remarried in 1220 to Hugh X of Lusignan, Count of La Marche, by whom she had another nine children.

Some of Isabella&#x27;s contemporaries, as well as later writers, claim that she formed a conspiracy against King Louis IX of France in 1241, after being publicly snubbed by his mother, Blanche of Castile, for whom she harbored a deep-seated hatred. In 1244, after the plot had failed, Isabella was accused of attempting to poison the king. To avoid arrest, she sought refuge in Fontevraud Abbey, where she died two years later, but none of this can be confirmed.

==Queen consort of England==
Isabella was the only daughter and heir of Aymer Taillefer, Count of Angoulême, by Alice of Courtenay, who was a sister of Peter II of Courtenay, Latin Emperor of Constantinople. Alice and Peter II were grandchildren of King Louis VI of France through their father Peter I of Courtenay.

Isabella became Countess of Angoulême in her own right on 16 June 1202, by which time she was already queen of England. Her marriage, at age 12 or 14, to King John took place on 24 August 1200, in Angoulême, a year after he annulled his first marriage to Isabel of Gloucester. She was crowned queen in an elaborate ceremony on 8 October at Westminster Abbey in London. Isabella was originally betrothed to Hugh IX le Brun, Count of Lusignan, grandson and heir of the Count of La Marche. As a result of John&#x27;s temerity in taking her as his second wife, King Philip II of France confiscated all of their French lands and armed conflict ensued.

At the time of her marriage to John, the blonde-haired blue-eyed Isabella was already renowned by some for her beauty and has sometimes been called the Helen of the Middle Ages by historians. Isabella was much younger than her husband and possessed a volatile temper similar to his own. King John was infatuated with his young, beautiful wife; however, his acquisition of her had at least as much to do with spiting his enemies as romantic love. She was already engaged to Hugh IX le Brun when she was taken by John. It was said that he neglected his state affairs to spend time with Isabella, often remaining in bed with her until noon. However, these were rumors spread by John&#x27;s enemies to discredit him as a weak and grossly irresponsible ruler, given that at the time John was engaging in a desperate war against King Philip II of France to hold on to the remaining Plantagenet duchies. The common people began to term her a &quot;siren&quot; or &quot;Messalina&quot; for her allure. Her mother-in-law, Eleanor of Aquitaine, readily accepted her as John&#x27;s wife.

On 1 October 1207, at Winchester Castle, Isabella gave birth to a son and heir, the future King Henry III of England, who was named after his grandfather King Henry II. He was quickly followed by another son, Richard, and three daughters: Joan, Isabella and Eleanor. All five children survived into adulthood and made illustrious marriages; all but Joan produced offspring of their own.

==Second marriage==
When King John died in October 1216, Isabella&#x27;s first act was to arrange the speedy coronation of her nine-year-old son at the city of Gloucester on 28 October. As the royal crown had recently been lost in the Wash, along with the rest of King John&#x27;s treasure, she supplied her own golden circlet to be used in lieu of a crown. The following July, less than a year after his crowning as King Henry III of England, she left him in the care of his regent, William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, and returned to France to assume control of her inheritance of Angoulême.

In the spring of 1220, Isabella married Hugh X of Lusignan, &quot;le Brun&quot;, Seigneur de Luisignan, Count of La Marche, the son of her former fiancé, Hugh IX, to whom she had been betrothed before her marriage to King John. It had been previously arranged that her eldest daughter Joan should marry Hugh, and the little girl was being brought up at the Lusignan court in preparation for her marriage. Hugh, however, upon seeing Isabella, whose beauty had not diminished, preferred the girl&#x27;s mother. Joan was provided with another husband, King Alexander II of Scotland, whom she wed in 1221.

Isabella married Hugh without the consent of the king&#x27;s council in England, as was required of a queen dowager. That council had the power not only to assign to her any subsequent husband, but to decide whether she should be allowed (or forced) to remarry at all. That Isabella flouted its authority moved the council to confiscate her dower lands and to stop the payment of her pension. Isabella and her husband retaliated by threatening to keep Joan, who had been promised in marriage to the King of Scotland, in France. The council first responded by sending furious letters to the Pope, signed in the name of young King Henry, urging him to excommunicate Isabella and her husband, but then decided to come to terms with Isabella, to avoid conflict with the Scottish king, who was eager to receive his bride. Isabella was granted the stannaries in Devon, and the revenue of Aylesbury for a period of four years, in compensation for her confiscated dower lands in Normandy, as well as the £3,000 arrears for her pension.

Isabella had nine more children by Hugh X. Their eldest son Hugh XI of Lusignan succeeded his father as Count of La Marche and Count of Angoulême in 1249.

Isabella&#x27;s children from her royal marriage did not join her in Angoulême, remaining in England with their eldest brother Henry III.

==Rebellion and death==
Described by some contemporaries as &quot;vain, capricious and troublesome,&quot; Isabella could not reconcile herself with her less prominent position in France. Though a former queen of England, Isabella was now mostly regarded as a mere countess and had to give precedence to other women. In 1241, when Isabella and Hugh were summoned to the French court to swear fealty to King Louis IX of France&#x27;s brother, Alphonse, who had been invested as Count of Poitou, their mother, Queen Dowager Blanche openly snubbed her. This so infuriated Isabella, who had a deep-seated hatred of Blanche for having fervently supported the French invasion of England during the First Barons&#x27; War in May 1216, that she began to conspire actively against King Louis. Isabella and her husband, along with other disgruntled nobles, including her son-in-law Count Raymond VII of Toulouse, sought to create an English-backed confederacy which united the provinces of the south and west against the French king. She encouraged her son Henry in his invasion of Normandy in 1230, but then did not provide him the support she had promised.

In 1244, after the confederacy had failed and Hugh had made peace with King Louis, two royal cooks were arrested for attempting to poison the king; upon questioning they confessed to having been in Isabella&#x27;s pay. Before Isabella could be taken into custody, she fled to Fontevraud Abbey, where she died on 4 June 1246.

By Isabella&#x27;s own prior arrangement, she was first buried in the abbey&#x27;s churchyard as an act of repentance for her many misdeeds. On a visit to Fontevraud, her son King Henry III of England was shocked to find her buried outside the abbey and ordered her immediately moved inside. She was finally placed beside Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine. Afterwards, most of her many Lusignan children, having few prospects in France, set sail for England and the court of Henry, their half-brother.

<doc id="49302" wikidata="Q101090" url="?curid=49302" title="Pope Eleutherius">
<text>Pope Eleutherius (; died 24 May 189), also known as Eleutherus (), was the bishop of Rome from c. 174 to his death in 189. His pontificate is alternatively dated to 171–185 or 177–193. He is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church.

He is linked to a number of legends, one of them credited him with receiving a letter from &quot;Lucius, King of Britain&quot;.

==Life==
According to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, he was a Greek born in Nicopolis in Epirus, Greece. His contemporary Hegesippus wrote that he was a deacon of the Roman Church under Pope Anicetus (c. 154–164), and remained so under Pope Soter, whom he succeeded around 174.

==Dietary law==
The 6th-century recension of &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; (&#x27;Book of the Popes&#x27;) known as the &quot;Felician Catalog&quot; includes additional commentary to the work&#x27;s earlier entry on Eleutherius. One addition ascribes to Eleutherius the reissuance of a decree: &quot;And he again affirmed that no food should be repudiated by Christians strong in their faith, as God created it, [provided] however that it is sensible and edible.&quot; Such a decree might have been issued against early continuations of Jewish dietary law and against similar laws practiced by the Gnostics and Montanists. It is also possible, however, that the editor of the passage attributed to Eleutherius a decree similar to another issued around the year 500 in order to give it greater authority.

==British mission==

Another addition credited Eleutherius with receiving a letter from &quot;Lucius, King of Britain&quot; or &quot;King of the Britons&quot;, declaring an intention to convert to Christianity. Authoratiative accounts from the First and Second Centuries, of Terullian, St Clement, and St Iraneaus referred to Britain as being of the first as having been impacted by the Christian faith. Lately, ancient religious records have been quickly labeled as pious forgery, however it has been admittedly reproduced by several of the most reliable, including the letter itself transcribed by John Foxe in his 14th Century work &quot;Acts and Monuments&quot;. This stands alongside the reputations of ‘Liber Pontificalis’ written in 535AD, the Cisterian Hagiagropher Jocelyn in the 12th Century, Gildas, Geoffrey of Monmouth, Bede, Urban, John of Teigmouth and Capgrave other Augustinian (English Roman), that preceded Foxe by nearly 1,000 years. Those who question it&#x27;s validity will then move to discussion over its original purpose. Haddan, Stubbs, and Wilkins considered the passage &quot;manifestly written in the time and tone&quot; of Prosper of Aquitaine, secretary to Pope Leo the Great in the mid-5th century, and supportive of the missions of Germanus of Auxerre and Palladius. Duchesne dated the entry a little later to the pontificate of Boniface II around 530, and Mommsen to the early 7th century. Only the last would support the conjecture that it aimed to support the Gregorian mission to the Anglo-Saxons led by Augustine of Canterbury, who encountered great difficulty with the native British Christians, as at the Synod of Chester. Indeed, the Celtic Christians invoked the antiquity of their church to generally submission to Canterbury until the Norman conquest, but no arguments invoking the mission to Lucius appear to have been made by either side during the synods among the Welsh and Saxon bishops.

Some claim that the first Englishman to mention the story was Bede and he seems to have taken it, not from native texts or traditions, but from &quot;The Book of the Popes&quot;. Subsequently, it appeared in the 9th-century &quot;History of the Britons&quot; traditionally credited to Nennius: The account relates that a mission from the pope baptised &quot;Lucius, the Britannic king, with all the petty kings of the whole Britannic people&quot;. The account, however, dates this baptism to AD 167 (a little before Eleutherius&#x27;s pontificate) and credits it to Evaristus (reigned ). In the 12th century, more details began to be added to the story. Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s pseudohistorical &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot; goes into great detail concerning Lucius and names the pope&#x27;s envoys to him as Fagan and Duvian. The 12th-century &quot;Book of Llandaf&quot; placed the court of Lucius in southern Wales and names his emissaries to the pope as Elfan and Medwy.

Others cite the reliable histories from centuries before, not only &quot;Gildas, Geoffrey of Monmouth, Bede, Urban, John of Teigmouth and Capgrave, referred to ‘as the most learned of English Augustinians whom the soil of England ever produced’, support the date of return of the emissaries of King Lucius from visiting Bishop Eleutherius at Rome, as that given in the British annals, a.d. 183, over a century and a half before the Roman Catholic Church was founded. Cardinal Baronius not only denounces the Augustinian claim but in detail recites the whole record from the year a.d. 36 onward.&quot;

An echo of this legend penetrated even to Switzerland. In a homily preached at Chur and preserved in an 8th- or 9th-century manuscript, Timothy is represented as an apostle to Gaul, whence he went into Roman Britain and baptised a king named Lucius, who himself became a missionary to Gaul and finally settled at Chur, where he preached the gospel with great success. In this way Lucius, the early missionary of the Swiss district of Chur, became identified with the alleged British king of the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;.

Harnack suggests that in the document which the compiler of the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; drew his information, the name found was not &#x27;, but &#x27;. Now this is the name (&#x27;, &#x27;) of the fortress of Edessa. The king in question is, therefore, Lucius Ælius Septimus Megas Abgar VIII, of Edessa, a Christian king as is well known. The original statement of the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, in this hypothesis, had nothing to do with Britain; the compiler of the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; changed &#x27; to &#x27;, and in this way made a British king of the Syrian Lucius.

==Death==
According to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, Pope Eleutherius died on 24 May and was buried on the Vatican Hill (&quot;&quot;) near the body of Peter the Apostle. Later tradition has his body moved to the church of San Giovanni della Pigna, near the pantheon. In 1591, his remains were again moved to the church of Santa Susanna at the request of Camilla Peretti, the sister of Pope Sixtus V. His feast is celebrated on 26 May.

<doc id="49304" wikidata="Q171421" url="?curid=49304" title="Henry Morton Stanley">
<text>Sir Henry Morton Stanley (born John Rowlands; 28 January 1841 – 10 May 1904) was a Welsh-American explorer, journalist, soldier, colonial administrator, author, and politician famous for his exploration of Central Africa and search for missionary and explorer David Livingstone. Besides his discovery of Livingstone, he is mainly known for his search for the sources of the Nile and Congo rivers, the work he undertook as an agent of King Leopold II of the Belgians that enabled the occupation of the Congo Basin region, and his command of the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition. He was knighted in 1897, and served in Parliament as a Liberal Unionist member for Lambeth North from 1895 to 1900.

More than a century after his death, Stanley&#x27;s legacy remains the subject of enduring controversy. Although he personally had high regard for many of the native African people who accompanied him on his expeditions, the exaggerated accounts of corporal punishment and brutality in his books fostered a public reputation as a hard-driving, cruel leader, in contrast to the supposedly more humanitarian Livingstone. His contemporary image in Britain also suffered from the inaccurate perception that he was American. In the 20th century, his reputation was also seriously damaged by his role in establishing the Congo Free State for King Leopold II. Nevertheless, he is recognised for his important contributions to Western knowledge of the geography of Central Africa and for his resolute opposition to the slave trade in East Africa.

==Early life==

Henry Stanley was born as John Rowlands in Denbigh, Denbighshire, Wales. His mother Elizabeth Parry was 18 years old at the time of his birth. She abandoned him as a very young baby and cut off all communication. Stanley never knew his father, who died within a few weeks of his birth. There is some doubt as to his true parentage. As his parents were unmarried, his birth certificate describes him as a bastard; he was baptised in the parish of Denbigh on 19 February 1841, the register recording that he had been born on 28 January of that year. The entry states that he was the bastard son of John Rowland of Llys Llanrhaidr and Elizabeth Parry of Castle. The stigma associated with illegitimacy weighed heavily upon him all his life.

The boy was given his father&#x27;s surname of Rowlands and brought up by his grandfather Moses Parry, a once-prosperous butcher who was living in reduced circumstances. He died when John was five. Rowlands then stayed with families of cousins and nieces for a short time, but he was eventually sent to the St Asaph Union Workhouse for the Poor. The overcrowding and lack of supervision resulted in his being frequently abused by older boys. Historian Robert Aldrich has alleged that the headmaster of the workhouse raped or sexually assaulted Rowlands, and that the older Rowlands was &quot;incontrovertibly bisexual&quot;. When Rowlands was 10 years old, his mother and two half-siblings stayed for a short while in this workhouse, but he did not recognise them until the headmaster told him who they were.

==Life in the United States==
Rowlands emigrated to the United States in 1859 at age 18. He disembarked at New Orleans and, according to his own declarations, became friends by accident with Henry Hope Stanley, a wealthy trader. He saw Stanley sitting on a chair outside his store and asked him if he had any job openings. He did so in the British style: &quot;Do you need a boy, sir?&quot; The childless man had indeed been wishing he had a son, and the inquiry led to a job and a close relationship between them. Out of admiration, John took Stanley&#x27;s name. Later, he wrote that his adoptive parent died two years after their meeting, but in fact the elder Stanley did not die until 1878. This and other discrepancies led John Bierman to argue that no adoption took place. Tim Jeal goes further, and, in his biography, subjects Stanley&#x27;s account in his posthumously published &quot;Autobiography&quot; to detailed analysis. Because Stanley got so many basic facts wrong about his purported adoptive family, Jeal concludes that it is very unlikely that he ever met rich Henry Hope Stanley, and that an ordinary grocer, James Speake, was Rowlands&#x27; true benefactor until his (Speake&#x27;s) sudden death in October 1859.

Stanley reluctantly joined in the American Civil War, first enrolling in the Confederate States Army&#x27;s 6th Arkansas Infantry Regiment and fighting in the Battle of Shiloh in 1862. After being taken prisoner there, he was recruited at Camp Douglas, Illinois, by its commander Colonel James A. Mulligan as a &quot;Galvanized Yankee.&quot; He joined the Union Army on 4 June 1862 but was discharged 18 days later because of severe illness. After recovering, he served on several merchant ships before joining the US Navy in July 1864. He became a record keeper on board the , and participated in the First Battle of Fort Fisher and the Second Battle of Fort Fisher, which led him into freelance journalism. Stanley and a junior colleague jumped ship on 10 February 1865 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in search of greater adventures. Stanley was possibly the only man to serve in the Confederate Army, the Union Army, and the Union Navy.

==British expedition to Abyssinia (1867–1868)==

Following the American Civil War, Stanley became a journalist in the days of frontier expansion in the American West. He then organised an expedition to the Ottoman Empire that ended catastrophically when he was imprisoned. He eventually talked his way out of jail and received restitution for damaged expedition equipment.

In 1867, the emperor of Ethiopia, Tewodros II, held a British envoy and others hostage, and a force was sent to effect the release of the hostages. Stanley accompanied that force as a special correspondent of the &quot;New York Herald&quot;. His report on the Battle of Magdala in 1868 was the first to be published, as he had bribed a telegraph operator to send his story first, even before the official army report. After his message was sent, the cable broke; British government officials were greatly irritated to learn of the battle from an American newspaper. Subsequently, he was assigned to report on Spain&#x27;s Glorious Revolution in 1868. In 1870, Stanley undertook several assignments for the &quot;Herald&quot; in the Middle East and the Black Sea region, visiting Egypt, Jerusalem, Constantinople, the Crimea, the Caucasus, Persia and India, during which time he apparently carved his name into a stone of the ancient palace at Persepolis in Persia.

==Finding David Livingstone expedition (1871–1872)==
Stanley travelled to Zanzibar in March 1871, later claiming that he outfitted an expedition with 192 porters. In his first dispatch to the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, however, he stated that his expedition numbered only 111. This was in line with figures in his diaries. James Gordon Bennett Jr., publisher of the &quot;New York Herald&quot; and funder of the expedition, had delayed sending to Stanley the money he had promised, so Stanley borrowed money from the United States Consul.

During the expedition through the tropical forest, his thoroughbred stallion died within a few days after a bite from a tsetse fly, many of his porters deserted, and the rest were decimated by tropical diseases.

Stanley found David Livingstone on 10 November 1871 in Ujiji, near Lake Tanganyika in present-day Tanzania. He later claimed to have greeted him with the now-famous line, &quot;Dr. Livingstone, I presume?&quot; However, this line does not appear in his journal from the time—the two pages directly following the recording of his initial spotting of Livingstone were torn out of the journal at some point—and it is likely that Stanley simply embellished the pithy line sometime afterwards. Neither man mentioned it in any of the letters they wrote at this time, and Livingstone tended to instead recount the reaction of his servant, Susi, who cried out: &quot;An Englishman coming! I see him!&quot; The phrase is first quoted in a summary of Stanley&#x27;s letters published by &quot;The New York Times&quot; on 2 July 1872. Stanley biographer Tim Jeal argued that the explorer invented it afterwards to help raise his standing because of &quot;insecurity about his background&quot;, though ironically the phrase was mocked in the press for being absurdly formal for the situation.

The &quot;Herald&quot;&#x27;s own first account of the meeting, published 1 July 1872, reports:

Stanley joined Livingstone in exploring the region, finding that there was no waterway from Lake Tanganyika to the Nile. On his return, he wrote a book about his experiences: &quot;How I Found Livingstone; travels, adventures, and discoveries in Central Africa&quot; (1872).

== First trans-Africa expedition (1874–1877)==
In 1874, the &quot;New York Herald&quot; and the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; financed Stanley on another expedition to Africa. His ambitious objective was to complete the exploration and mapping of the Central African Great Lakes and rivers, in the process circumnavigating Lakes Victoria and Tanganyika and locating the source of the Nile. Between 1875 and 1876 Stanley succeeded in the first part of his objective, establishing that Lake Victoria had only a single outlet, the one discovered by John Hanning Speke on 21 July 1862 and named Ripon Falls. If this was not the Nile&#x27;s source, then the separate massive northward flowing river called by Livingstone, the Lualaba, and mapped by him in its upper reaches, might flow on north to connect with the Nile via Lake Albert and thus be the river&#x27;s primary source.

It was therefore essential that Stanley should trace the course of the Lualaba downstream (northward) from Nyangwe, the point where Livingstone had left it in July 1871. Between November 1876 and August 1877, Stanley and his men navigated the Lualaba up to and beyond the point where it turned sharply westward, away from the Nile, identifying itself as the Congo River. Having succeeded with this second objective, they then traced the river to the sea. During this expedition, Stanley used sectional boats and dug-out canoes to pass the large cataracts that separated the Congo into distinct tracts. These boats were transported around the rapids before being reassembled to travel on the next section of river. In passing the rapids many of his men were drowned, including his last white colleague, Frank Pocock. The expedition was repeatedly attacked by natives in canoes. Stanley and his men reached the Portuguese outpost of Boma, around from the mouth of the Congo River on the Atlantic Ocean, after 999 days on 9 August 1877. Muster lists and Stanley&#x27;s diary (12 November 1874) show that he started with 228 people and reached Boma with 114 survivors, with him the only European left alive out of four. In Stanley&#x27;s &quot;Through the Dark Continent&quot; (1878) (in which he coined the term &quot;Dark Continent&quot; for Africa), Stanley said that his expedition had numbered 356, the exaggeration detracting from his achievement.

Stanley attributed his success to his leading African porters, saying that his success was &quot;all due to the pluck and intrinsic goodness of 20 men ... take the 20 out and I could not have proceeded beyond a few days&#x27; journey&quot;. Professor James Newman has written that &quot;establishing the connection between the Lualaba and Congo Rivers and locating the source of the Victoria Nile&quot; justified him (Newman) in stating that: &quot;In terms of exploration and discovery as defined in nineteenth-century Europe, he (Stanley) clearly stands at the top.&quot;

==International Upper Congo Expedition (1879–1884)==

On 15 April 1877, King Leopold II of the Belgians sent his first expedition to Central Africa, then still under the flag of the International African Association. The members of the expedition, four Belgians, departing from Zanzibar, had the goal of establishing a scientific post in Karema, in today&#x27;s Tanzania, but even before the group entered Central Africa, two of them had already died, one from a sun stroke, the other from a severe fever, upon which the other members of the expedition resigned. Because of these difficulties, Leopold realised how important it was to find experienced men to lead his expeditions. He first tried to persuade Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza, but he had already entered French service; his eye now fell on Stanley. Stanley had first hoped to continue his pioneering work in Africa under the British flag. But neither the Foreign Office nor Edward, the Prince of Wales, felt called to receive Stanley after the many rumours of his looting and killing in the interior of the African continent. Leopold eagerly received a disenchanted Stanley at his palace in June 1878, and signed a five-year contract with him in November.

Stanley persuaded Leopold that the first step should be the construction of a wagon trail around the Congo rapids and a chain of trading stations on the river. To avoid discovery, materials and workers were shipped in by various roundabout routes, and communications between Stanley and Leopold were entrusted to Colonel Maximilien Strauch.

=== Stanley as Leopold&#x27;s agent ===
In 1879, Stanley left for Africa for his first mission, ostensibly working for the Comité d&#x27;études du Haut-Congo, under Leopold&#x27;s orders. King Leopold gave Stanley clear instructions: &quot;It is not about Belgian colonies. It is about establishing a new state that is as large as possible and about its governance. It should be clear that in this project there can be no question of granting the Negroes the slightest form of political power. That would be ridiculous. The whites, who lead the posts, have all the power.&quot;

Stanley described in writings his dismay with the terrible scenes taking place in Congo. At the same time, his &quot;findings&quot; conveyed an idea that the Dark Continent must submit, willingly or otherwise. Stanley&#x27;s writings show that he, too, held this view. &quot;Only by proving that we are superior to the savages, not only through our power to kill them but through our entire way of life, can we control them as they are now, in their present stage; it is necessary for their own well-being, even more than ours.&quot;

Unexpectedly, France had sent its own expedition to the Congo Basin. Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza had undermined Stanley&#x27;s mission by concluding contracts himself with native heads of state. The creation of a station that would later be called Brazzaville could not be prevented. Leopold was furious, writing angrily to Strauch: &quot;The terms of the treaties Stanley has made with native chiefs do not satisfy me. There must at least be an added article to the effect that they delegate to us their sovereign rights ... the treaties must be as brief as possible and in a couple of articles must grant us everything.&quot;

Since everything in Central Africa was about the balance of power between the Great Powers, Leopold considered his next moves and sent an envoy to Berlin to press for a conference. Leopold wanted the International Association of the Congo boundaries drawn by Stanley to be officially confirmed, thus giving the Association an official status.

On 26 February 1885, the Berlin Act was signed. The Act regulated an immense free trade zone in the Congo Basin and made it a neutral territory. Furthermore, the Act declared war on slavery. The act contained only one article that Leopold disliked: Article 17 gave the superpowers the right to establish an international commission to supervise the freedom of trade and navigation in Congo. As a result, Leopold would not be able to collect customs duties on the Congo River 

In 1890, on the 25th anniversary of Leopold&#x27;s reign as Belgian monarch, Stanley was taken from one banquet hall to another, proclaimed a hero. Leopold honoured him with the Order of Leopold. Together they examined the entire Congolese situation. The key question was how the Free State could become profitable. Stanley pointed out to the monarch, among other things, the potential of rubber production. Stanley wrote: &quot;You can find it on almost any tree. As we made our way through the forest, it was literally raining rubber juice. Our clothes were full of it. The Congo has so many tributaries that a well-organized company can easily extract a few tons of rubber per year here. You only have to sail up such a river and the branches with rubber hang almost up to your ship.&quot;

In 1891, rubber extraction was divided among concessionaires. This soon led to abuses, when the switch was made to &quot;forced labour&quot;.

=== Founding of Leopoldville (Kinshasa) ===

Stanley, who had left from a post at Vivi near Matadi on 21 February 1880, arrived at Stanley pool on 3 December 1882. Building a road from Vivi to Isangila, Stanley took almost 2 years to traverse the rapids towing with him 50 tonnes of equipment, including 2 dismantled steamboats and a barge. After he arrived at Stanley pool, a local king, Makoko of the Anziku Kingdom, gave him a site near Kintambo to build a city. Despite hostilities from another nearby king, Ngaliema, he decided to start the construction of Léopoldville on the hillside of Khonzo Izulu. Today Kinshasa&#x27;s population is 17,000,000, and it is one of the world&#x27;s fastest growing megacities.

=== Dealings with Zanzibari slave traders ===
Tippu Tip, the most powerful of Zanzibar&#x27;s slave traders of the 19th century, was well known to Stanley, as was the social chaos and devastation brought by slave-hunting. It had only been through Tippu Tip&#x27;s help that Stanley had found Livingstone, who had survived years on the Lualaba under Tippu Tip&#x27;s friendship. Now, Stanley discovered that Tippu Tip&#x27;s men had reached still further west in search of fresh populations to enslave.

Four years earlier, the Zanzibaris had thought the Congo deadly and impassable and warned Stanley not to attempt to go there, but when Tippu Tip learned that Stanley had survived, he was quick to act. Villages throughout the region were burned and depopulated. Tippu Tip had raided 118 villages, killed 4,000 Africans, and, when Stanley reached his camp, had 2,300 slaves, mostly young women and children, in chains ready to transport halfway across the continent to the markets of Zanzibar. 

Having found the new ruler of the Upper Congo, Stanley had no choice but to negotiate an agreement with him, to stop Tip coming further downstream and attacking Leopoldville and other stations. To achieve this, he had to allow Tip to build his final river station just below Stanley Falls, which prevented vessels from sailing further upstream. At the end of his physical resources, Stanley returned home, to be replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Francis de Winton, a former British Army officer.

==Emin Pasha Relief Expedition (1887–1890)==


In 1886, Stanley led the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition to &quot;rescue&quot; Emin Pasha, the governor of Equatoria in the southern Sudan, who was threatened by Mahdist forces. King Leopold II demanded that Stanley take the longer route via the Congo River, hoping to acquire more territory and perhaps even Equatoria After immense hardships and great loss of life, Stanley met Emin in 1888, mapped the Ruwenzori Range and Lake Edward, and emerged from the interior with Emin and his surviving followers at the end of 1890. Despite its success, this expedition tarnished Stanley&#x27;s name because of the conduct of the other Europeans on the expedition. Army Major Edmund Musgrave Barttelot was killed by an African porter after behaving with extreme cruelty. James Sligo Jameson, heir to Irish whiskey manufacturer Jameson&#x27;s, allegedly bought a 10-year-old girl and offered her to cannibals to document and sketch how she was cooked and eaten. Stanley found out only when Jameson had died of fever.

The spread of sleeping sickness across areas of central and eastern Africa that were previously free of the disease has been attributed to this expedition, but this hypothesis has been disputed. Sleeping sickness had been endemic in these regions for generations and then flared into epidemics as colonial trade increased trade throughout Africa during the ensuing decades.

In a number of publications made after the expedition, Stanley asserts that the purpose of the effort was singular; to offer relief to Emin Pasha. For example, he writes the following while explaining the final route decision.

However, Stanley&#x27;s other writings point to a secondary goal which was precisely territorial annexation. He writes in his book on the expedition about his meeting with the Sultan of Zanzibar, when he arrived there at the start of the expedition, and a certain matter that was discussed at that meeting. At first, he is not explicit on the agenda but it is clear enough:

A few pages further in the same book, Stanley explains what the matter was about and this time, he makes it clear that indeed, it had to do with annexation.

The records at the National Archives at Kew, London, offer an even deeper insight and show that annexation was a purpose he had been aware of for the expedition. This is because there are a number of treaties curated there (and gathered by Stanley himself from what is present-day Uganda during the Emin Pasha Expedition), ostensibly gaining British protection for a number of African chiefs. Amongst these were a number that have long been identified as possible frauds. A good example is treaty number 56, supposedly agreed upon between Stanley and the people of &quot;Mazamboni, Katto, and Kalenge&quot;. These people had signed over to Stanley, &quot;the Sovereign Right and Right of Government over our country for ever in consideration of value received and for the protection he has accorded us and our Neighbours against KabbaRega and his Warasura.&quot;

==Later years==
On his return to Europe, Stanley married English artist Dorothy Tennant. They adopted a child named Denzil, who was the son of one of Stanley&#x27;s first cousins, though Stanley concealed this fact from the public and possibly even from Dorothy. Denzil later donated around 300 items to the Stanley archives at the Royal Museum of Central Africa in Tervuren, Belgium in 1954. He died in 1959.

Mainly at his wife&#x27;s behest, Stanley took up British citizenship and entered Parliament as a Liberal Unionist member for Lambeth North, serving from 1895 to 1900. He disliked politics and made little impression on Parliament. He became Sir Henry Morton Stanley when he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the 1899 Birthday Honours, in recognition of his service to the British Empire in Africa. In 1890, he was given the Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold by King Leopold II.

Stanley died at his home at 2 Richmond Terrace, Whitehall, London on 10 May 1904. At his funeral, he was eulogised by Daniel P. Virmar. His grave is in the churchyard of St Michael and All Angels&#x27; Church in Pirbright, Surrey, marked by a large piece of granite inscribed with the words &quot;Henry Morton Stanley, Bula Matari, 1841–1904, Africa&quot;. Bula Matari translates as &quot;Breaker of Rocks&quot; or &quot;Breakstones&quot; in Kongo and was Stanley&#x27;s name among locals in Congo. It can be translated as a term of endearment for, as the leader of Leopold&#x27;s expedition, he commonly worked with the labourers breaking rocks with which they built the first modern road along the Congo River. Author Adam Hochschild suggested that Stanley understood it as a heroic epithet, but there is evidence that Nsakala, the man who coined it, had meant it humorously.

==Controversies==
===Overview===
Having survived for ten years of his childhood in the workhouse at St Asaph, it is postulated that he needed as a young man to be thought of as harder and more formidable than other explorers. This made him exaggerate punishments and hostile encounters. It was a serious error of judgement for which his reputation continues to pay a heavy price. In the conclusion to his account of a fight with a fellow boy while in the workhouse, Stanley remarked, &quot;Often since have I learned how necessary is the application of force for the establishment of order. There comes a time when pleading is of no avail.&quot; He was accused of indiscriminate cruelty against Africans by contemporaries, which included men who served under him or otherwise had first-hand information. Stanley himself acknowledged, &quot;Many people have called me hard, but they are always those whose presence a field of work could best dispense with, and whose nobility is too nice to be stained with toil.&quot;

About society women, Stanley wrote that they were &quot;toys to while slow time&quot; and &quot;trifling human beings.&quot; When he met the American journalist and traveller May Sheldon, he was attracted because she was a modern woman who insisted on serious conversation and not social chit-chat. &quot;She soon lets you know that chaff won&#x27;t do,&quot; he wrote. The authors of the book &quot;The Congo: Plunder and Resistance&quot; tried to argue that Stanley had &quot;a pathological fear of women, an inability to work with talented co-workers, and an obsequious love of the aristocratic rich,&quot; This is not only at odds with his opinions about society women, but Stanley&#x27;s intimate correspondence in the Royal Museum of Central Africa, between him and his two fiancées, Katie Gough Roberts and Alice Pike, as well as between him and the American journalist May Sheldon, and between him and his wife Dorothy Tennant, shows that he enjoyed close relationships with those women, but both Roberts and Pike ultimately rejected him when he refused to abandon his protracted travels.

When Stanley married Dorothy, he invited his friend, Arthur Mounteney Jephson, to visit while they were on their honeymoon. Dr. Thomas Parke also came because Stanley was seriously ill at the time. Stanley&#x27;s good relations with these two colleagues from the Emin Pasha Expedition could possibly be seen as demonstrating that he could get along with colleagues.

===General opinion about African people===

In &quot;Through the Dark Continent&quot;, Stanley observed the peoples of the region, and wrote that &quot;the savage only respects force, power, boldness, and decision&quot;. Stanley further wrote: &quot;If Europeans will only ... study human nature in the vicinity of Stanley Pool (Kinshasa), they will go home thoughtful men, and may return again to this land to put to good use the wisdom they should have gained ... during their peaceful sojourn.&quot;

In &quot;How I Found Livingstone&quot; (1872), he wrote that he was &quot;prepared to admit any black man possessing the attributes of true manhood, or any good qualities ... to a brotherhood with myself.&quot;

Stanley insulted and shouted at William Grant Stairs and Arthur Jephson for mistreating the Wangwana. He described the history of Boma as &quot;two centuries of pitiless persecution of black men by sordid whites&quot;. He also wrote about what he thought was the superior beauty of black people in comparison with whites. According to Jeal, Stanley was not a racist, unlike his contemporaries Sir Richard Burton and Sir Samuel Baker.

===Opinion about mixed African-Arab peoples===
The Wangwana of Zanzibar were of mixed Arabian and African ancestry: &quot;Africanized Arabs&quot;, in Stanley&#x27;s words. They became the backbone of all his major expeditions and were referred to as &quot;his dear pets&quot; by sceptical young officers on the Emin Pasha Expedition, who resented their leader for favouring the Wangwana above themselves. &quot;All are dear to me&quot;, Stanley told William Grant Stairs and Arthur Jephson, &quot;who do their duty and the Zanzibaris have quite satisfied me on this and on previous expeditions.&quot; Stanley came to think of an individual Wangwana as &quot;superior in proportion to his wages to ten Europeans&quot;. When Stanley first met a group of his Wangwana assistants, he was surprised: &quot;They were an exceedingly fine looking body of men, far more intelligent in appearance than I could ever have believed African barbarians could be&quot;.

On the other hand, in one of his books, Stanley said about mixed Afro-Arab people: &quot;For the half-castes I have great contempt. They are neither black nor white, neither good nor bad, neither to be admired nor hated. They are all things, at all times ... If I saw a miserable, half-starved negro, I was always sure to be told, he belonged to a half-caste. Cringing and hypocritical, cowardly and debased, treacherous and mean ... this syphilitic, blear-eyed, pallid-skinned, abortion of an Africanized Arab.&quot;

===Accounts of cruel treatment toward African people===
The British House of Commons appointed a committee to investigate missionary reports of Stanley&#x27;s mistreatment of native populations in 1871, which was likely secured by Horace Waller, a member on the committee of the Anti-slavery Society and fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. The British vice consul in Zanzibar, John Kirk (Waller&#x27;s brother-in-law) conducted the investigation. Stanley was charged with excessive violence, wanton destruction, the selling of labourers into slavery, the sexual exploitation of native women and the plundering of villages for ivory and canoes. Kirk&#x27;s report to the British Foreign Office was never published, but in it, he claimed: &quot;If the story of this expedition were known it would stand in the annals of African discovery unequalled for the reckless use of power that modern weapons placed in his hands over natives who never before heard a gun fired.&quot; When Kirk was appointed to investigate reports of brutality against Stanley, he was delighted because he had hated Stanley for almost a decade. Firstly, for having publicly exposed him (Kirk) for having failed to send provisions to Livingstone from Zanzibar during the late 1860s; secondly, because Stanley had revealed in the press that Kirk had sent slaves to David Livingstone as porters, rather than the free men Livingstone had made very plain he wanted. Kirk was related to Horace Waller by marriage; and so Waller also hated Stanley on Kirk&#x27;s behalf. He used his membership of the executive committee of the Universities Mission to Central Africa to persuade J. P. Farler (a missionary in East Africa) to name Stanley&#x27;s assistants who might provide evidence against the explorer and be prepared to be interviewed by Kirk in Zanzibar. An American merchant in Zanzibar, Augustus Sparhawk, wrote that several of Stanley&#x27;s African assistants, including Manwa Sera, &quot;a big rascal and too fond of money&quot;, had been bribed to tell Kirk what he wanted to hear. Stanley was accused, in Kirk&#x27;s report, of cruelty to his Wangwana carriers and guards whom he idolised and who re-enlisted with him again and again. He wrote to the owner of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, insisting that he (Lawson) force the British government to send a warship to take the Wangwana home to Zanzibar and to pay all their back wages. If a ship was not sent, they would die on their overland journey home. The ship was sent. Stanley&#x27;s hatred of the promiscuity that had caused his illegitimacy and his legendary shyness with women, made the Kirk report&#x27;s claim that he had accepted an African mistress offered to him by Kabaka Mutesa exceedingly implausible. Both Stanley and his colleague, Frank Pocock, loathed slavery and the slave trade and wrote about this loathing in letters and diaries at this time, which speaks against the likelihood that they sold their own men. The report was never shown to Stanley, so he had been unable to defend himself.

In a letter to the Secretary of the Royal Geographical Society in the 1870s, Conservative MP and treasurer of the Aborigines&#x27; Protection Society, Sir Robert Fowler, who believed Kirk&#x27;s report and refused to &quot;whitewash Stanley&quot;, insisted that his &quot;heartless butchery of unfortunate natives has brought dishonour on the British flag and must have rendered the course of future travellers more perilous and difficult.&quot;

General Charles George Gordon remarked in a letter to Richard Francis Burton that Stanley shared Samuel Baker&#x27;s tendency to write openly about deploying firearms against Africans in self-defense: &quot;These things may be done, but not advertised&quot;, Burton himself wrote that Stanley &quot;shoots negros as if they were monkeys&quot; in an October 1876 letter to Kirk. He also loathed Stanley for disproving his long-held theory that Lake Tanganyika, which he was the first European to discover, was the true source of the Nile, which may have influenced Burton to misrepresent Stanley&#x27;s activities in Africa.

In 1877, not long after one of Stanley&#x27;s expeditions, Farler met with African porters who had been part of the expedition and wrote, &quot;Stanley&#x27;s followers give dreadful accounts to their friends of the killing of inoffensive natives, stealing their ivory and goods, selling their captives, and so on. I do think a commission ought to inquire into these charges, because if they are true, it will do untold harm to the great cause of emancipating Africa ... I cannot understand all the killing that Stanley has found necessary&quot;. Stanley, when reporting the American Indian Wars as a young reporter, had been encouraged by his editors to exaggerate the number of Indians killed by the US Army. The legacy for Stanley, of being a helpless illegitimate boy, deserted by both parents, was a deep sense of inferiority that could only be kept at bay by claims of being much more powerful and feared than he was. Tim Jeal, in his biography of Stanley, has shown by a study of Stanley&#x27;s diary and his colleague Frank Pocock&#x27;s diary that on almost every occasion when there was conflict with Africans on the Congo in 1875–76, Stanley exaggerated the scale of the conflict and the deaths on both sides. On 14 February 1877, according to his colleague, Frank Pocock&#x27;s diary, Stanley&#x27;s nine canoes, and his sectional boat the &quot;Lady Alice&quot;, were attacked and followed by eight canoes, crewed by Africans with firearms. In Stanley&#x27;s book, &quot;Through the Dark Continent&quot;, Stanley inflated this incident into a major battle, by increasing the number of hostile canoes to 60 and adjusting the casualties accordingly.

Stanley wrote with some measure of satisfaction when describing how Captain John Hanning Speke, the first European to visit Uganda, had been punched in the teeth for disobedience to Sidi Mubarak Bombay, a caravan leader also employed by Stanley, which made Stanley claim that he would never allow Bombay to have the audacity to stand up for a boxing match with him. In the same paragraph, Stanley described how he several months later administered punishment to the African.

William Grant Stairs found Stanley during the Emin Pasha expedition to be cruel, secretive and selfish. John Rose Troup, in his book about the Emin Pasha expedition, said that he saw Stanley&#x27;s self-serving and vindictive side: &quot;In the forgoing letter he brings forward disgraceful charges, that really do not refer to me at all, although he blames me for what happened. The injustice of his accusations, made as they are without documentary or, as far as I can learn, any evidence, can hardly be made clear to the public, but they must be aware, when they read what has preceded this correspondence, that he has acted as no one in his position should have acted&quot;.

By way of counterpoint, it may be noted that, in later in life, Stanley rebuked subordinates for inflicting needless corporal punishment. For beating one of his most trusted African servants, he told Lieutenant Carlos Branconnier &quot;that cruelty was not permissible&quot; and that he would dismiss him for a future offence, and he did. Stanley was admired by Arthur Jephson, whom William Bonny, the acerbic medical assistant, described as the &quot;most honourable&quot; officer on the expedition. Jephson wrote, &quot;Stanley never fights where there is the smallest chance of making friends with the natives and he is wonderfully patient &amp; long suffering with them&quot;. Writer Tim Jeal has argued that during Stanley&#x27;s 1871 expedition, he treated his indigenous porters well under &quot;contemporary standards.&quot;

===Possible inspiration for &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;===
The legacy of death and destruction in the Congo region during the Free State period and the fact that Stanley had worked for Leopold are considered by author Norman Sherry to have made him an inspiration for Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness.&quot;

Conrad, however, had spent six months of 1890 as a steamship captain on the Congo, years after Stanley had been there (1879–1884) and five years after Stanley had been recalled to Europe and ceased to be Leopold&#x27;s chief agent in Africa.

==Honours and legacy==
A former hospital in St Asaph, north Wales, was named after Stanley in honour of his birth in the area. It was formerly the workhouse in which he spent much of his early life. Memorials to Stanley were erected in St Asaph and in Denbigh (a statue of Stanley with an outstretched hand) in 2011. A working party was set up in 2020 to consider new wording for a plaque on the St Asaph obelisk, and a public consultation and vote was held in 2021 over a proposal to remove the Denbigh statue, which resulted in an 80 per cent majority for retaining the statue.

Taxa named in honour of Stanley include:
* freshwater snail &quot;Gabbiella stanleyi&quot; (E. A. Smith, 1877)
* freshwater snail genus &quot;Stanleya&quot; Bourguignat, 1885
The mineral stanleyite is named in his honour, as the describer of the mineral was surnamed Livingstone but a mineral named livingstonite (named for David Livingstone) already existed.

Stanley Electric, a major Japanese supplier of automotive lighting, was named by founder Takaharu Kitano after Stanley in admiration of his &quot;perseverance and pioneering spirit&quot;.

<text>In law, standing or locus standi is a condition that a party seeking a legal remedy must show they have, by demonstrating to the court, sufficient connection to and harm from the law or action challenged to support that party&#x27;s participation in the case. A party has standing in the following situations:

* The party is directly subject to an adverse effect by the statute or action in question, and the harm suffered will continue unless the court grants relief in the form of damages or a finding that the law either does not apply to the party or that the law is void or can be nullified. In informal terms, a party must have something to lose. The party has standing because they will be directly harmed by the conditions for which they are asking the court for relief.
* The party is not directly harmed by the conditions by which they are petitioning the court for relief but asks for it because the harm involved has some reasonable relation to their situation, and the continued existence of the harm may affect others who might not be able to ask a court for relief. In the United States, this is the grounds for asking for a law to be struck down as violating the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, because while the plaintiff might not be directly affected, the law might so adversely affect others that one might never know what was not done or created by those who fear they would become subject to the law. This is known as the &quot;chilling effects&quot; doctrine.
* The party is granted automatic standing by act of law. For example, under some environmental laws in the United States, a party may sue someone causing pollution to certain waterways without a federal permit, even if the party suing is not harmed by the pollution being generated. The law allows the plaintiff to receive attorney&#x27;s fees if they substantially prevail in the action. In some U.S. states, a person who believes a book, film or other work of art is obscene may sue in their own name to have the work banned directly without having to ask a district attorney to do so.

In the United States, the current doctrine is that a person cannot bring a suit challenging the constitutionality of a law unless they can demonstrate that they are or will &quot;imminently&quot; be harmed by the law. Otherwise, the court will rule that the plaintiff &quot;lacks standing&quot; to bring the suit, and will dismiss the case without considering the merits of the claim of unconstitutionality.

==International courts==
The Council of Europe created the first international court before which individuals have automatic &quot;locus standi&quot;.

==Australia==
Australia has a common law understanding of &quot;locus standi&quot; or standing which is expressed in statutes such as the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and common law decisions of the High Court of Australia especially the case &quot;Australian Conservation Foundation v Commonwealth&quot; (1980). At common law, the test for standing is whether the plaintiff has a &quot;special interest in the subject matter of the action&quot;. Under the &quot;Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act&quot; 1977 to have standing the applicant must be &quot;a person who is aggrieved&quot;, defined as &quot;a person whose interests are adversely affected&quot; by the decision or conduct complained of. This has generally been interpreted in accordance with the common law test.

There is no open standing, unless statute allows it, or represents needs of a specified class of people. The issue is one of remoteness.

Standing may apply to class of aggrieved people, where essentially the closeness of the plaintiff to the subject matter is the test. Furthermore, a plaintiff must show that he or she has been specially affected in comparison with the public at large.

Also, while there is no open standing per se, prerogative writs like certiorari, writ of prohibition, quo warranto and habeas corpus have a low burden in establishing standing. Australian courts also recognise amicus curiae (friend of the court), and the various Attorneys General have a presumed standing in administrative law cases.

==Canada==
In Canadian administrative law, whether an individual has standing to bring an application for judicial review, or an appeal from the decision of a tribunal, is governed by the language of the particular statute under which the application or the appeal is brought. Some statutes provide for a narrow right of standing while others provide for a broader right of standing.

Frequently a litigant wishes to bring a civil action for a declaratory judgment against a public body or official. This is considered an aspect of administrative law, sometimes with a constitutional dimension, as when the litigant seeks to have legislation declared unconstitutional.

===Public interest standing===
The Supreme Court of Canada developed the concept of public interest standing in three constitutional cases commonly called &quot;the Standing trilogy&quot;: &quot;Thorson v. Attorney General of Canada&quot;, &quot;Nova Scotia Board of Censors v. McNeil&quot;, and &quot;Minister of Justice v. Borowski&quot;. The trilogy was summarized as follows in &quot;Canadian Council of Churches v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)&quot;:

Public-interest standing is also available in non-constitutional cases, as the Court found in &quot;Finlay v. Canada (Minister of Finance)&quot;.

==Nigeria==
Like in other jurisdictions, the right to approach a court is contained in the Constitution. The right to approach a court has been interpreted in several cases, this has led to the right to be view differently in different cases. In recent times, there have been different approaches to locus standi. They are:

* Traditional approach — only the party who has suffered pecuniary damage or special damage can seek redress in a court of law. In the case of Airtel Networks Ltd. v. George it was held that &quot;a party is said to have locus if he has shown sufficient interest in the action and that his civil rights and obligations have been or are in danger of being infringed&quot;. Under this approach, a party can only seek redress provided he has proved to the satisfaction of the court that he has suffered sufficient damage over and above any other persons in the concern action. Particularly, only the Attorney General can seek redress in any case on public affairs except the party is authorised through fiat emanates from the Attorney General.
* Liberal approach — a departure or exception to the traditional approach. Locus standi may be granted to any person who challenges any unconstitutionality provided the person is subject to the constitution. This expands locus standi on constitutional issues. Justice Aboki of the Court of Appeal said &quot;the requirement of (strict) locus standi become unnecessary in constitutional issues as it will merely impede judicial function&quot;. Likewise, any person can challenge infringement of fundamental human rights.

==United Kingdom==
In British administrative law, an applicant needs to have a sufficient interest in the matter to which the application relates. This sufficient interest requirement has been construed liberally by the courts. As Lord Diplock put it:

In the law of contract, the doctrine of privity means that only those who are party to a contract can sue or be sued upon it. This doctrine was substantially amended by the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, which allows third parties specified in a contract to enforce it provided the contract expressly grants them the right to do so.

Almost all criminal prosecutions are brought by the state via the Crown Prosecution Service, so private prosecutions are rare. An exception was the case of &quot;Whitehouse v Lemon&quot; where Mrs Mary Whitehouse, a self-appointed guardian of suburban morality, was permitted to bring a private prosecution for blasphemous libel (an offence still in existence until 2008) against the publisher of &quot;Gay News&quot;, Denis Lemon. Victims of crime have standing to sue the perpetrator and they may claim criminal injuries compensation from the state. If the state fails properly to bring a case, the victim or his family may have standing to bring a private prosecution, as in the case of Stephen Lawrence.

==United States==
In United States law, the Supreme Court has stated, &quot;In essence the question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues.&quot; John Rutledge, the second chief justice of the United States, was largely responsible for denying the Supreme Court the right to give advisory opinions at the Constitutional Convention. Being a judge himself, he strongly believed that a judge&#x27;s sole purpose was to resolve legal conflicts; he held that judges should hand down an opinion only when they rule on an actual case.

There are a number of requirements that a plaintiff must establish to have standing before a federal court. Some are based on the case or controversy requirement of the judicial power of Article Three of the United States Constitution, § 2, cl.1. As stated there, &quot;The Judicial Power shall extend to all Cases ... [and] to Controversies ...&quot;. The requirement that a plaintiff have standing to sue is a limit on the role of the judiciary and the law of Article III standing is built on the idea of separation of powers.

Federal courts may exercise power only &quot;in the last resort, and as a necessity&quot;. The Supreme Court has determined that the case or controversy requirement found in Article Three prohibits United States federal courts from issuing advisory opinions. Accordingly, before the court will hear a case, it must find that the parties have a tangible interest at stake in the matter, the issue presented must be &quot;mature for judicial resolution&quot; or ripe, and a justiciable issue must remain before the court throughout the course of the lawsuit.

The American doctrine of standing is assumed as having begun with the case of &quot;Frothingham v. Mellon&quot;. However, legal standing truly rests its first prudential origins in &quot;Fairchild v. Hughes&quot;, (1922) which was authored by Justice Louis Brandeis. In &quot;Fairchild&quot;, a citizen sued the Secretary of State and the Attorney General to challenge the procedures by which the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified. Prior to it, the doctrine was that all persons had a right to pursue a private prosecution of a public right. Since then the doctrine has been embedded in judicial rules and some statutes.

In 2011, in &quot;Bond v. United States&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court held that a criminal defendant charged with violating a federal statute does have standing to challenge the constitutionality of that statute under the Tenth Amendment.

===Standing requirements===
There are three standing requirements:

# Injury-in-fact: The plaintiff must have suffered or imminently will suffer injury—an invasion of a legally protected interest that is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent (that is, neither conjectural nor hypothetical; not abstract). The injury can be either economic, non-economic, or both.
# Causation: There must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of, so that the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and not the result of the independent action of some third party who is not before the court.
# Redressability: It must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that a favorable court decision will redress the injury.

===Prudential limitations===
Additionally, there are three major prudential (judicially created) standing principles (prudential standing). Congress can override these principles via statute:

# General prohibition of third-party standing: A party may only assert their own rights and cannot raise the claims of a third party who is not before the court; exceptions exist where the third party has interchangeable economic interests with the injured party, or a person unprotected by a particular law sues to challenge the oversweeping of the law into the rights of others. For example, a party suing over a law prohibiting certain types of visual material, may sue because the First Amendment rights of theirs, and others engaged in similar displays, might be damaged.Additionally, third parties who do not have standing may be able to sue under the next friend doctrine if the third party is an infant, mentally handicapped, or not a party to a contract. One example of a statutory exception to the prohibition of third party standing exists in the &quot;qui tam&quot; provision of the Civil False Claims Act.
# Prohibition of generalized grievances: A plaintiff cannot sue if the injury is widely shared in an undifferentiated way with many people. For example, the general rule is that there is no federal taxpayer standing, as complaints about the spending of federal funds are too remote from the process of acquiring them. Such grievances are ordinarily more appropriately addressed in the representative branches.
# Zone of interest test: There are in fact two tests used by the United States Supreme Court for the zone of interest
## Zone of injury: The injury is the kind of injury that Congress expected might be addressed under the statute.
## Zone of interests: The party is arguably within the zone of interest protected by the statute or constitutional provision.

===Recent development of the doctrine===
In 1984, the Supreme Court reviewed and further outlined the standing requirements in a major ruling concerning the meaning of the three standing requirements of injury, causation, and redressability. In the suit, parents of black public school children alleged that the Internal Revenue Service was not enforcing standards and procedures that would deny tax-exempt status to racially discriminatory private schools. The Court found that the plaintiffs did not have the standing necessary to bring suit. Although the Court established a significant injury for one of the claims, it found the causation of the injury (the nexus between the defendant&#x27;s actions and the plaintiff&#x27;s injuries) to be too attenuated. &quot;The injury alleged was not fairly traceable to the Government conduct respondents challenge as unlawful&quot;.

In another major standing case, &quot;Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife&quot;, 504 U.S. 555 (1992), the Supreme Court elaborated on the redressability requirement for standing. The case involved a challenge to a rule promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior interpreting §7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA). The rule rendered §7 of the ESA applicable only to actions within the United States or on the high seas. The Court found that the plaintiffs did not have the standing necessary to bring suit, because no injury had been established. The injury claimed by the plaintiffs was that damage would be caused to certain species of animals and that this in turn injures the plaintiffs by the reduced likelihood that the plaintiffs would see the species in the future. The court insisted though that the plaintiffs had to show how damage to the species would produce imminent injury to the plaintiffs. The Court found that the plaintiffs did not sustain this burden of proof. &quot;The &#x27;injury in fact&#x27; test requires more than an injury to a cognizable interest. It requires that the party seeking review be himself among the injured&quot;. The injury must be imminent and not hypothetical.

Beyond failing to show injury, the Court found that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate the standing requirement of redressability. The Court pointed out that the respondents chose to challenge a more generalized level of government action, &quot;the invalidation of which would affect all overseas projects&quot;. This programmatic approach has &quot;obvious difficulties insofar as proof of causation or redressability is concerned&quot;.

In a 2000 case, &quot;Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens&quot;, 529 U.S. 765 (2000), the United States Supreme Court endorsed the &quot;partial assignment&quot; approach to &quot;qui tam&quot; relator standing to sue under the False Claims Act — allowing private individuals to sue on behalf of the U.S. government for injuries suffered solely by the government.

In a 2009 case, &quot;Summers v. Earth Island Institute,&quot; 555 U.S. 488 (2009), the Supreme Court held the petitioner environmental organizations&#x27; claim that it was &quot;statistically likely&quot; that some of their members would visit the affected lands was insufficient to support Article III standing. The majority opinion stated the &quot;deprivation of a procedural right without some concrete interest that is affected by the deprivation . . . is insufficient to create Article III standing.&quot;

===Taxpayer standing===
The initial case that established the doctrine of standing, &quot;Frothingham v. Mellon&quot;, was a taxpayer standing case.

Taxpayer standing is the concept that any person who pays taxes should have standing to file a lawsuit against the taxing body if that body allocates funds in a way that the taxpayer feels is improper. The United States Supreme Court has held that taxpayer standing is not by itself a sufficient basis for standing against the United States government. The Court has consistently found that the conduct of the federal government is too far removed from individual taxpayer returns for any injury to the taxpayer to be traced to the use of tax revenues, e.g., &quot;United States v. Richardson.&quot;

In &quot;DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno&quot;, the Court extended this analysis to state governments as well. However, the Supreme Court has also held that taxpayer standing is constitutionally sufficient to sue a municipal government in a federal court.

States are also protected against lawsuits by their sovereign immunity. Even where states waive their sovereign immunity, they may nonetheless have their own rules limiting standing against simple taxpayer standing against the state. Furthermore, states have the power to determine what will constitute standing for a litigant to be heard in a state court, and may deny access to the courts premised on taxpayer standing alone.

In California, taxpayers have standing to sue for any &#x27;illegal expenditure of, waste of, or injury to the estate, funds, or other property of a local agency&#x27;. In Florida, a taxpayer has standing to sue if the state government is acting unconstitutionally with respect to public funds, or if government action is causing some special injury to the taxpayer that is not shared by taxpayers in general. In Virginia, the Supreme Court of Virginia has more or less adopted a similar rule. An individual taxpayer generally has standing to challenge an act of a city or county where they live, but does not have general standing to challenge state expenditures.

===Standing to challenge statutes===
With limited exceptions, a party cannot have standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute unless they will be subjected to the provisions of that statute. There are some exceptions, however; for example, courts will accept First Amendment challenges to a statute on overbreadth grounds, where a person who is only partially affected by a statute can challenge the parts that do not affect him on the grounds that laws that restrict speech have a chilling effect on other people&#x27;s right to free speech.

The only other way someone can have standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute is if the existence of the statute would otherwise deprive him of a right or a privilege even if the statute itself would not apply to him. The Virginia Supreme Court made this point clear in the case of &quot;Martin v. Ziherl&quot; 607 S.E.2d 367 (Va. 2005). Martin and Ziherl were girlfriend and boyfriend and engaged in unprotected sexual intercourse when Martin discovered that Ziherl had infected her with herpes, even though he knew he was infected and did not inform her of this. She sued him for damages, but because it was illegal (at the time the case was filed) to commit &quot;fornication&quot; (sexual intercourse between a man and a woman who are not married), Ziherl argued that Martin could not sue him because joint tortfeasors – those involved in committing a crime – cannot sue each other over acts occurring as a result of a criminal act (&quot;Zysk v. Zysk&quot;, 404 S.E.2d 721 (Va. 1990)). Martin argued in rebuttal that because of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; (finding that state&#x27;s sodomy law unconstitutional), Virginia&#x27;s anti-fornication law was also unconstitutional for the reasons cited in Lawrence. Martin argued, therefore, she could, in fact, sue Ziherl for damages.

Lower courts decided that because the Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney does not prosecute fornication cases and no one had been prosecuted for fornication anywhere in Virginia in over 100 years, Martin had no risk of prosecution and thus lacked standing to challenge the statute. Martin appealed. Since Martin had something to lose – the ability to sue Ziherl for damages – if the statute was upheld, she had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute even though the possibility of her being prosecuted for violating it was zero. Since the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Lawrence&quot; had found that there is a privacy right in one&#x27;s private, noncommercial sexual practices, the Virginia Supreme Court decided that the statute against fornication was unconstitutional. The finding gave Martin standing to sue Ziherl since the decision in &quot;Zysk&quot; was no longer applicable.

However, the only reason Martin had standing to challenge the statute was that she had something to lose if it stayed on the books.

===Standing to challenge a contract award===
Only an &quot;interested party&quot; has standing to challenge a federal contract award. In this context, an &quot;interested party&quot; is a company or person who bid for a contract, or a prospective bidder, whose &quot;direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the contract&quot; to another business.

=== Ballot measures ===
In &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that being the proponents of a ballot measure is not by itself enough to confer legal standing. In that case, Proposition 8 had banned same-sex marriage in California, a ban that was ruled unconstitutional. The Supreme Court ruled that the proponents of Proposition 8 has no standing in court since they failed to show that they were harmed by the decision.

===State law===
State law on standing differs substantially from federal law and varies considerably from state to state.

====California====
Californians may bring &quot;taxpayer actions&quot; against public officials for wasting public funds through mismanagement of a government agency, where the relief sought is an order compelling the official not to waste money and fulfill his duty to protect the public fisc.

On December 29, 2009, the California Court of Appeal for the Sixth District ruled that California Code of Civil Procedure Section 367 cannot be read as imposing a federal-style standing doctrine on California&#x27;s code pleading system of civil procedure. In California, the fundamental inquiry is &quot;always&quot; whether the plaintiff has sufficiently plead a cause of action, not whether the plaintiff has some entitlement to judicial action separate from proof of the substantive merits of the claim advanced. The court acknowledged that the word &quot;standing&quot; is often sloppily used to refer to what is really &quot;jus tertii&quot;, and held that &quot;jus tertii&quot; in state law is not the same thing as the federal standing doctrine.

====District of Columbia====
The District of Columbia&#x27;s regulations concerning contract award appeals provide for the jurisdiction of the District&#x27;s Contracts Appeals Board. Standing to appeal a bid is limited to unsuccessful bidders who are in line to be awarded a contract should their protest be successful: the Board has regularly held that a protestor who would not be in line for the contract lacks standing.

<text>In United States law, ripeness refers to the readiness of a case for litigation; &quot;a claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.&quot; For example, if a law of ambiguous quality has been enacted but never applied, a case challenging that law lacks the ripeness necessary for a decision.

The goal is to prevent premature adjudication; if a dispute is insufficiently developed, any potential injury or stake is too speculative to warrant judicial action. Ripeness issues most usually arise when a plaintiff seeks anticipatory relief, such as an injunction. 

Originally stated in &quot;Liverpool, New York &amp; Philadelphia Steamship Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration&quot; (1885), ripeness is one the seven rules of the constitutional avoidance doctrine established in &quot;Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority&quot; (1936) that requires that the Supreme Court of the United States to &quot;not &#x27;anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it. The Court fashioned a two-part test for assessing ripeness challenges to federal regulations. The case is often applied to constitutional challenges to federal and state statutes as well. The Court said in &quot;Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner&quot;, :

In both &quot;Abbott Laboratories&quot; and its first companion case, &quot;Toilet Goods Association v. Gardner&quot;, , the Court upheld pre-enforcement review of an administrative regulation. However, the Court denied such review in the second companion case because any harm from noncompliance with the FDA regulation at issue was too speculative in the Court&#x27;s opinion to justify judicial review. Justice Harlan wrote for the Court in all three cases.

The ripeness doctrine should not be confused with the advisory opinion doctrine, another justiciability concept in American law.

<text>The terms moot, mootness and moot point are used both in English and in American law, although with significantly different meanings.

In the legal system of the United States, a matter is &quot;moot&quot; if further legal proceedings with regard to it can have no effect, or events have placed it beyond the reach of the law. Thereby the matter has been deprived of practical significance or rendered purely academic.

The U.S. development of this word stems from the practice of moot courts, in which hypothetical or fictional cases were argued as a part of legal education. These purely academic settings led the U.S. courts to describe cases where developing circumstances made any judgment ineffective as &quot;moot&quot;.

The mootness doctrine can be compared to the ripeness doctrine, another court rule (rather than law), that holds that judges should not rule on cases based entirely on anticipated disputes or hypothetical facts. These rules and similar doctrines, taken together, prevent the federal courts of the United States from issuing advisory opinions, as required by the Case or Controversy Clause of the United States Constitution.

The usage in the British legal system, on the other hand, is that the term &quot;moot&quot; has the meaning of &quot;remains open to debate&quot; or &quot;remains unresolved&quot;. The divergence in usage was first observed in the United States and the extent to which the U.S. definition is used in U.S. jurisprudence and public discourse has ensured it is rarely used in a British courtroom. This is partially to avoid ambiguity, but also because the British definition is rarely relevant in practical cases.

==U.S. federal courts==
In the U.S. federal judicial system, a moot case must be dismissed, there being a constitutional limitation on the jurisdiction 
of the federal courts. The reason for this is that Article Three of the United States Constitution limits the jurisdiction of all federal courts to &quot;cases and controversies&quot;. Thus, a civil action or appeal in which the court&#x27;s decision will not affect the rights of the parties is ordinarily beyond the power of the court to decide, provided it does not fall within one of the recognized exceptions.

A textbook example of such a case is the United States Supreme Court case &quot;DeFunis v. Odegaard&quot;, . The plaintiff was a student who had been denied admission to law school, and had then been provisionally admitted during the pendency of the case. Because the student was slated to graduate within a few months at the time the decision was rendered, and there was no action the law school could take to prevent that, the Court determined that a decision on its part would have no effect on the student&#x27;s rights. Therefore, the case was dismissed as moot.

However, there is disagreement as to both the source of the standards, and their application in the courts. Some courts and observers opine that cases &quot;must&quot; be dismissed because this is a constitutional bar, and there is no &quot;case or controversy&quot;; others have rejected the pure constitutional approach and adopted a so-called &quot;prudential&quot; view, where dismissal &quot;may&quot; depend upon a host of factors, whether the particular person has lost a viable interest in the case, or whether the issue itself survives outside the interests of the particular person, whether the circumstance are likely to recur, etc. In actual practice, the U.S. federal courts have been uneven in their decisions, which has led to the accusation that determinations are &quot;ad hoc&quot; and &#x27;result-oriented.&#x27;

There are four major exceptions to this mootness rule. These are cases of &quot;voluntary cessation&quot; on the part of the defendant; questions that involve secondary or collateral legal consequences; questions that are &quot;capable of &quot;repetition,&quot; yet evading review&quot;; and questions involving class actions where the named party ceases to represent the class.

===Voluntary cessation===
Where a defendant is acting wrongfully, but as a tactic to avoid an adverse decision, ceases to engage in such conduct once a litigation has been threatened or commenced, the court will still not deem this correction to moot the case. Obviously, a party could stop acting improperly just long enough for the case to be dismissed and then resume the improper conduct. For example, in &quot;Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.&quot;, , the Supreme Court held that an industrial polluter, against whom various deterrent civil penalties were being pursued, could not claim that the case was moot, even though the polluter had ceased polluting and had closed the factory responsible for the pollution. The court noted that so long as the polluter still retained its license to operate such a factory, it could open similar operations elsewhere if not deterred by the penalties sought.

A separate situation occurs when a court dismisses as &quot;moot&quot; a legal challenge to an existing law, in the case where the law being challenged is either amended or repealed through legislation before the court case could be settled. Since the remedy available for a bad law is simply the removal or changing of the law, the court&#x27;s decision cannot create an outcome different than that which has already occurred. As such, any decision would merely be advisory, in violation of the Case or Controversy clause. While this sometimes casually referred to as voluntary cessation, the differences in available remedy make it distinct from technical voluntary cessation.

A recent instance of this occurred in &quot;Moore v. Madigan,&quot; where Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan declined to appeal a ruling from the Seventh Circuit striking down Illinois&#x27; handgun carry ban to the United States Supreme Court. As Illinois subsequently passed a law legalizing concealed carry with a state-issued license, the appeal would have been moot since the original case or controversy was no longer relevant.

===Secondary or collateral legal consequences===
&quot;The obvious fact of life is that most criminal convictions do in fact entail adverse collateral legal consequences. The mere possibility that this will be the case is enough to preserve a criminal case from ending ignominiously in the limbo of mootness.&quot; Sibron v. New York.

===Capable of repetition, yet evading review===
A court will allow a case to go forward if it is the type for which persons will frequently be faced with a particular situation, but will likely cease to be in a position where the court can provide a remedy for them in the time that it takes for the justice system to address their situation. The most frequently cited example is the 1973 United States Supreme Court case of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, , which challenged a Texas law forbidding abortion in most circumstances. The state argued that the case was moot because plaintiff Roe was no longer pregnant by the time the case was heard. As Justice Blackmun wrote in the majority opinion:

The normal 266-day human gestation period is so short that the pregnancy will come to term before the usual appellate process is complete. If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied. Our law should not be that rigid.

By contrast, in &quot;McCorvey v. Hill&quot;, 2004, the case failed to proceed based on being moot, without standing and out of time.

The Court cited &quot;Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC&quot;, , which had held that a case was not moot when it presented an issue that was &quot;capable of repetition, yet evading review&quot;. Perhaps in response to increasing workloads at all levels of the judiciary, the recent trend in the Supreme Court and other U.S. courts has been to construe this exception rather narrowly.

Many cases fall under the &quot;capable of repetition&quot; doctrine; however, because there is a review process available under most circumstances, the exception to declaring mootness did not apply to such cases. In &quot;Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div. v. Craft&quot;, 436 U. S. 1, 8–9 (1978), the court noted that claims for damages save cases from mootness.

===Class action representatives===
Where a class action lawsuit is brought, with one named plaintiff actually representing the interests of many others, the case will not become moot even if the named plaintiff ceases to belong to the class that is seeking a remedy. In &quot;Sosna v. Iowa&quot;, , the plaintiff represented a class that was challenging an Iowa law that required persons to reside there for a year before seeking a divorce in Iowa&#x27;s courts. The Supreme Court held that, although the plaintiff successfully divorced in another state, her attorneys could continue to competently advance the interests of other members of the class.

===Abuse of mootness doctrine not acceptable===
Construction of a project without regulatory compliance cannot be used to moot a court case challenge simply because construction has been completed. Since remedies remain available even long after the project has been completed, the case remains non-moot.

For example, where an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was challenged, completion of the project construction could not be used to evade regulatory compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) as the 9th Circuit Court explained:
==U.S. state courts==
The U.S. state courts are not subject to the Article III limitations on their jurisdiction, and some state courts are permitted by their local constitutions and laws to render opinions in moot cases where the establishment of a legal precedent is desirable. They may also establish exceptions to the doctrine. For instance, in some state courts the prosecution can lodge an appeal after a defendant is acquitted: although the appellate court cannot set aside a not-guilty verdict due to double jeopardy, it can issue a ruling as to whether a trial court&#x27;s ruling on a particular issue during the trial was erroneous. This opinion will then be binding on future cases heard by the courts of that state.

Some U.S. states also accept certified questions from the federal courts or the courts of other states. Under these procedures, state courts can issue opinions, usually for the purpose of clarifying or updating state law, in cases not actually pending in those courts.

==Outside the U.S.==
Although free from the U.S. Constitutional limitation, Canada has recognized that considerations of judicial economy and comity with the legislative and executive branch may justify a decision to dismiss an allegedly moot case, as deciding hypothetical controversies is tantamount to legislating. Considerations of the effectiveness of advocacy involved in the adversarial system and the possibility of recurrence of an alleged constitutional violation may sway the court. Additionally, the federal and provincial governments can ask for advisory opinions in hypothetical scenarios, termed reference questions, from their respective highest courts.

==Moot point==
The phrase &#x27;&#x27; refers (in American English) to an issue that is irrelevant to a subject being discussed or (in British English) to one that is debatable. Due to the relatively uncommon usage of the word moot, and because &quot;moot&quot; and &quot;mute&quot; are homophones in some pronunciations, this is sometimes erroneously rendered as &quot;mute point&quot;.

<text>In law, a default is the failure to do something required by law or to comply with a contractual obligation. Legal obligations can arise when a response or appearance is required in legal proceedings, after taking out a loan, or as agreed in a contract; failure to carry them out puts one in defaults of the obligations.

The concept of a &quot;deliberate default&quot; was considered in a UK legal case determined in 2010, &quot;De Beers UK Ltd. v Atos Origin It Services UK Ltd.&quot;, where a contract had referred to this term. Edwards-Stuart J described &quot;deliberate default&quot; as meaning, in his view, Before the De Beers case there was little judicial guidance on the meaning of &quot;deliberate default&quot;.

The same term (&quot;deliberate defaulters&quot;) has been used by Her Majesty&#x27;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in the UK to describe &quot;people who deliberately get their tax affairs wrong&quot;.

==Default in legal proceedings==
Failure to appear at a required time in legal proceedings can constitute a default.

In the United States, for example, when a party has failed to file meaningful response to pleadings within the time allowed, with the result that only one side of a controversy has been presented to the court, the party who has pleaded a claim for relief and received no response may request entry of default. In some jurisdictions the court may proceed to enter judgment immediately: others require that the plaintiff file a notice of intent to take the default judgment and serve it on the unresponsive party. If this notice is not opposed, or no adequate justification for the delay or lack of response is presented, then the plaintiff is entitled to judgment in his favor. Such a judgment is referred to as a &quot;default judgment&quot; and, unless otherwise ordered, has the same effect as a judgment entered in a contested case.

It is possible to vacate or remove the default judgment, depending on the particular state&#x27;s law.

Entry of default in the United States district courts is governed by Rule 55 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

==Financial default==
A common type of default is failure to meet the financial obligations of a loan. This can occur due to inability to pay, or voluntarily in a strategic default. When the debtor is a government, it is called a sovereign default.

A notice of default is a notification given to a borrower stating that a payment has not been made by the predetermined deadline, or is otherwise in default on the mortgage contract. Other ways a borrower may be in default include not providing proper insurance coverage for the property, or not paying due property taxes as agreed. It dictates that if the money owed (plus an additional legal fee), or other breach(es) are not paid/remedied in a given time, the lender may choose to foreclose the borrower&#x27;s property. Any other people who may be affected by the foreclosure may also receive a copy of the notification.

<text>Clare Majella Martin (born 15 June 1952) is a former Australian journalist and politician. She was elected to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in a shock by-election win in 1995. She was appointed Opposition Leader in 1999, and won a surprise victory at the 2001 territory election, becoming the first Labor Party (ALP) and first female Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. At the 2005 election, she led Territory Labor to the second-largest majority government in the history of the Territory, before resigning as Chief Minister on 26 November 2007.

==Early life==
Martin was one of ten children. Her parents were Catholics and Democratic Labor Party supporters. Her uncle, Kevin Cairns, was a Liberal minister and MP in the McMahon government, but the family was not inclined towards his conservative politics. Martin&#x27;s ancestry includes the Coughlin family, which also had NSW&#x27;s first female statistician and the noted test cricketer Victor Trumper. The family was originally from County Offaly, Ireland, until the Cromwell invasion, then left County Cork in the 1850s just after the Great Famine. After attending Loreto Normanhurst, Martin graduated from the University of Sydney in 1975 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, in which her major study was Music.

==Pre-political career==
Having spent time in London and other overseas cities, she began working as a typist for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in Sydney in 1978. In 1979, she became a trainee reporter. After several years, she began to take an interest in presenting, but was told that she would not be given a position in Sydney unless she had experience elsewhere . In February 1983, Martin was then offered a six-month position presenting a morning radio show in Darwin for the ABC Radio station 5DR.

She had little intention of staying there, and briefly returned to Canberra in May 1983, before being offered a job in Sydney. However, at the same time, Martin&#x27;s partner was offered a partner&#x27;s position at the law firm he had worked in Darwin. He liked living in Darwin and was keen to take up the position, so Martin agreed to decline the Sydney job and return to Darwin in May 1985 where she gained another position on an ABC Radio morning show.

In 1986, Martin made the move to television, as the presenter of &quot;The 7.30 Report&quot; until 1988. After returning from long service leave where she cared for her two young children, Martin returned to work in 1990 to work on ABC Radio&#x27;s morning program.

==Political career==

|}
Martin had been interested in political journalism for some years, although she was not a member of any party, believing that party affiliation compromises journalistic integrity. In 1994, she was approached to contest the Darwin Legislative Assembly seat of Casuarina for the Labor Party at the 1994 election. However, she was defeated by Country Liberal Party candidate Peter Adamson. She soon resigned from the party and returned to journalism, but when former CLP Chief Minister Marshall Perron resigned from his Darwin seat of Fannie Bay, Martin opted to contest the ensuing by-election as the Labor candidate. Fannie Bay, like most Darwin electorates, had been a CLP stronghold; Perron held it with a majority of 8 percent. However, in a considerable upset, Martin went on to win the seat by 69 votes, becoming one of only two ALP MLAs in Darwin.

Martin worked hard to retain her seat at the 1997 election, and was successful, holding Fannie Bay despite a heavy defeat for the ALP. She subsequently served as Shadow Minister for Lands under then leader Maggie Hickey. When Hickey unexpectedly resigned in February 1999, Martin was in a position to succeed her, and was soon elected party leader, and hence Opposition Leader. She soon emerged as a vocal critic of the Burke government&#x27;s policy of mandatory sentencing, and began preparing the ALP for the next election, which was then two years away.

==Term as Chief Minister==
Martin faced her first electoral test as leader at the 2001 election. At the time, the Country Liberal Party had held office for 27 years, and Labor had never come particularly close to government. Indeed, it had never managed to win more than nine seats at any election. However, the ALP was coming off a particularly successful eighteen months, and Martin ran a skilled campaign. She was also able to take advantage of a number of gaffes made by then-Chief Minister Denis Burke, such as the decision to preference One Nation over the ALP – which lost the CLP a number of votes in crucial Darwin seats. The election also came during a bad time for the federal Coalition government, which was under fire for introducing a GST after previously vowing not to do so.

Despite this, most commentators were predicting the CLP would be returned for a ninth term in government, albeit with a reduced majority. However, in a shock result, Labor scored an eight-seat swing, achieving majority government by one seat. It did so on the strength of an unexpected Labor wave in Darwin. Labor had gone into the election holding only two seats in the capital—those of Martin and Paul Henderson—and had never held more than two seats in Darwin at any time. In the 2001 election, however, Labor took all but one seat in Darwin, including all seven seats in the northern part of the city. Darwin&#x27;s northern suburbs are somewhat more diverse than the rest of the city. In the process, they ousted four sitting MLAs; Labor had not unseated a CLP incumbent since 1980. Although the CLP won a bare majority of the two-party vote, Labor&#x27;s gains in Darwin were enough to make Martin the first ALP and first female Chief Minister in the history of the Northern Territory. Martin herself was reelected with a healthy swing of 9.2 percent in Fannie Bay, turning it into a safe Labor seat in one stroke.

As Chief Minister, Martin immediately set about making changes, repealing the territory&#x27;s controversial mandatory sentencing laws, and introducing freedom of information legislation, which had been neglected during the CLP&#x27;s 27-year rule. 

===Aboriginal issues===
Although Martin appointed Aboriginal Territorians to her cabinet, she has been criticised for not improving the lot of her Aboriginal constituents, who on average have a life expectancy well below that of white Australians. A respected commentator in &quot;The Bulletin&quot; suggested that she had gone slow on Aboriginal issues because she feared a white backlash that could have resulted in her government being toppled.

The life expectancy of the Northern Territory&#x27;s Aboriginal citizens did not increase markedly during Martin&#x27;s administration. Alcohol abuse continued to be a major issue in Aboriginal communities and third-world diseases like trachoma could be seen in remote Aboriginal townships. However, in 2006, Martin rejected accusations by John Howard and Federal Indigenous Affairs Minister, Mal Brough, that her government had been underfunding Aboriginal communities. A summit between the federal and territory governments was proposed by Mal Brough in May 2006, but this was snubbed by Martin.

Martin was critical of the Federal Government&#x27;s intervention in Aboriginal communities as announced in 2007. She opposed certain aspects of the intervention such as removal of the permit system. In response, the Federal Government rejected the Territory&#x27;s argument, saying it was essential to remove artificial barriers to Aboriginal townships that prevent the measures needed to improve living conditions for Indigenous children

===Achievements===
In the longer term, she oversaw the completion of the Adelaide-Darwin railway, which had begun under the Burke government, and vowed to resurrect the stalled statehood movement. She also managed to markedly boost the ALP&#x27;s standing among the electorate, as seen in the 2003 Katherine by-election, which saw a major swing to the party.

By 2005, the Northern Territory, under Martin&#x27;s leadership, had achieved the following:
* the highest economic growth in Australia at 7.2 per cent
* the lowest small business taxes
* record population growth
* the highest building approval rates
*surging house prices and record levels of home ownership.
* Property crime almost halved
* Approval for $1 billion development of Darwin wharf precinct

As Chief Minister, Martin led the ALP to the 2005 election, which was their first as an incumbent government in the Territory. Martin campaigned largely on law and order issues. It was predicted that the ALP would win a relatively narrow victory. However, in a result that had not been predicted by any commentators or even the most optimistic Labor observers, Martin led the ALP to a smashing victory. The final result gave 19 seats to the ALP, 4 to the opposition CLP and 2 to independents. The ALP won six seats from the CLP, four of which they had never won before in any election. Two of them were in Palmerston, an area where Labor had never previously come close to winning. In the most unexpected victory of all, the ALP even managed to unseat the Opposition Leader and former Chief Minister, Burke, in his own Palmerston-area electorate. Labor won the second-largest majority government in the history of the Territory, bettered only by the CLP&#x27;s near-sweep of the Legislative Assembly at the first elections, in 1974.

On 10 September 2007, Queensland Premier Peter Beattie announced he would leave politics that week. This left Martin as Labor&#x27;s longest-serving current state or territory leader, and as the longest-serving state or territory head of government in Australia, until she herself announced her resignation on 26 November 2007.

===Resignation===
On 26 November 2007, Clare Martin and her deputy Syd Stirling announced their resignations at a media conference in Darwin. Education Minister Paul Henderson was elected as the new leader and Chief Minister by the ALP caucus.

==Post-political career==
In 2008, Martin became chief executive officer of the Australian Council of Social Service, based in Sydney. In August 2010 she returned to the Northern Territory to become a Professorial Fellow in the Public and Social Policy Research Institute at Charles Darwin University.

In June 2019, she was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia for distinguished service to the people and Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory, and as a community advocate.

<text>Raymond Kanelba (1897–1960), also known as &quot;Rajmund Kanelba&quot;, was a 20th-century Polish painter.

He was born in Warsaw and educated there as well as in Vienna and Paris. He was strongly influenced by the école de Paris but with rather realistic and anti-impressionist style. In 1926 his works were on display in Salon des Indépendants and Salon d&#x27;Automne and in 1952 he had a large exposition of his paintings in New York City.

He was especially admired for his portraits of women, as well as his paintings of flowers, interiors, and street scenes. Some of his works were signed as Raymond Kanelba.

In 1955, the painter traveled to England, where he undertook the most important commission of his career – at the request of the Grenadier Regiment, he painted a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

Rajmund Kanelba lived most of his life in France but died in London.

<text>In mathematics, the unit interval is the closed interval , that is, the set of all real numbers that are greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1. It is often denoted &quot;&quot; (capital letter ). In addition to its role in real analysis, the unit interval is used to study homotopy theory in the field of topology.

In the literature, the term &quot;unit interval&quot; is sometimes applied to the other shapes that an interval from 0 to 1 could take: , , and . However, the notation &quot;&quot; is most commonly reserved for the closed interval .

== Properties ==

The unit interval is a complete metric space, homeomorphic to the extended real number line. As a topological space, it is compact, contractible, path connected and locally path connected. The Hilbert cube is obtained by taking a topological product of countably many copies of the unit interval.

In mathematical analysis, the unit interval is a one-dimensional analytical manifold whose boundary consists of the two points 0 and 1. Its standard orientation goes from 0 to 1.

The unit interval is a totally ordered set and a complete lattice (every subset of the unit interval has a supremum and an infimum).

===Cardinality===
The &quot;size&quot; or &quot;cardinality&quot; of a set is the number of elements it contains.

The unit interval is a subset of the real numbers formula_1. However, it has the same size as the whole set: the cardinality of the continuum. Since the real numbers can be used to represent points along an infinitely long line, this implies that a line segment of length 1, which is a part of that line, has the same number of points as the whole line. Moreover, it has the same number of points as a square of area 1, as a cube of volume 1, and even as an unbounded &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space formula_2 (see Space filling curve).

The number of elements (either real numbers or points) in all the above-mentioned sets is uncountable, as it is strictly greater than the number of natural numbers.

===Orientation===
The unit interval is a curve. The open interval (0,1) is a subset of the positive real numbers and inherits an orientation from them. The orientation is reversed when the interval is entered from 1, such as in the integral formula_3 used to define natural logarithm for &quot;x&quot; in the interval, thus yielding negative values for logarithm of such &quot;x&quot;. In fact, this integral is evaluated as a signed area yielding &quot;negative area&quot; over the unit interval due to reversed orientation there.

== Generalizations ==
The interval , with length two, demarcated by the positive and negative units, occurs frequently, such as in the range of the trigonometric functions sine and cosine and the hyperbolic function tanh. This interval may be used for the domain of inverse functions. For instance, when is restricted to then formula_4 is in this interval and arcsine is defined there.

Sometimes, the term &quot;unit interval&quot; is used to refer to objects that play a role in various branches of mathematics analogous to the role that plays in homotopy theory. For example, in the theory of quivers, the (analogue of the) unit interval is the graph whose vertex set is formula_5 and which contains a single edge &quot;e&quot; whose source is 0 and whose target is 1. One can then define a notion of homotopy between quiver homomorphisms analogous to the notion of homotopy between continuous maps.

== Fuzzy logic ==
In logic, the unit interval can be interpreted as a generalization of the Boolean domain {0,1}, in which case rather than only taking values 0 or 1, any value between and including 0 and 1 can be assumed. Algebraically, negation (NOT) is replaced with ; conjunction (AND) is replaced with multiplication (); and disjunction (OR) is defined, per De Morgan&#x27;s laws, as .

Interpreting these values as logical truth values yields a multi-valued logic, which forms the basis for fuzzy logic and probabilistic logic. In these interpretations, a value is interpreted as the &quot;degree&quot; of truth – to what extent a proposition is true, or the probability that the proposition is true.

<doc id="49325" wikidata="Q249683" url="?curid=49325" title="Houyhnhnm">
<text>Houyhnhnms are a fictional race of intelligent horses described in the last part of Jonathan Swift&#x27;s satirical 1726 novel &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. The name is pronounced either or . Swift apparently intended all words of the Houyhnhnm language to echo the neighing of horses.

==Description==

Gulliver&#x27;s visit to the Land of the Houyhnhnms is described in Part IV of his &quot;Travels&quot;, and its location illustrated on the map at the start of Part IV.

The map shows Houyhnhnms Land to be south of Australia; it indicates Edels Land and Lewins Land to the north, and Nuyts Land to the north-east, on the mainland with the islands of St Francis and St Pieter further east, and Sweers, Maatsuyker and De Wit islands to the east. The map is somewhat careless with the scale, however; Edels Land to Lewins Land are shown adjacent, while in reality they are some 1000 km apart, while the sweep of the Great Australian Bight, from Cape Leeuwin, Australia&#x27;s south-westerly point to the Maatsuyker Islands, off the southern tip of Tasmania, is over 3000 km.

Gulliver describes the land as &quot;divided by long rows of trees, not regularly planted but naturally growing&quot;, with a &quot;great plenty of grass, and several fields of oats&quot;.

The Houyhnhnms are rational equine beings and are masters of the land, contrasting strongly with the Yahoos, savage humanoid creatures who are no better than beasts of burden, or livestock. Whereas the Yahoos represent all that is bad about humans, Houyhnhnms have a settled, calm, reliable and rational society. Gulliver much prefers the Houyhnhnms&#x27; company to the Yahoos&#x27;, even though the latter are biologically closer to him.

==Interpretation==
It is possible to interpret the Houyhnhnms in a number of different ways. One interpretation could be a sign of Swift&#x27;s liberal views on race, or one could regard Gulliver&#x27;s preference (and his immediate division of Houyhnhnms into color-based hierarchies) as absurd and the sign of his self-deception. It is now generally accepted that the story involving the Houyhnhnms embody a wholly pessimistic view of the place of man and the meaning of his existence in the universe. In a modern context the story might be seen as presenting an early example of animal rights concerns, especially in Gulliver&#x27;s account of how horses are cruelly treated in his society and the reversal of roles. The story is a possible inspiration for Pierre Boulle&#x27;s novel &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;.

Book IV of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; is the keystone, in some ways, of the entire work, and critics have traditionally answered the question whether Gulliver is insane (and thus just another victim of Swift&#x27;s satire) by questioning whether or not the Houyhnhnms are truly admirable. Gulliver loves the land and is obedient to a race that is not like his own. The Houyhnhnm society is based upon reason, and only upon reason, and therefore the horses practice eugenics based on their analyses of benefit and cost. They have no religion and their sole morality is the defence of reason, and so they are not particularly moved by pity or a belief in the intrinsic value of life. Gulliver himself, in their company, builds the sails of his skiff from &quot;Yahoo skins&quot;. The Houyhnhnms&#x27; lack of passion surfaces during the scheduled visit of &quot;a friend and his family&quot; to the home of Gulliver&#x27;s master &quot;upon some affair of importance&quot;. On the day of the visit, the mistress of his friend and her children arrive very late. She made no excuses &quot;first for her husband&quot; who had died just that morning and she had to remain to make the proper arrangements for a &quot;convenient place where his body should be laid&quot;. Gulliver remarked that &quot;she behaved herself at our house as cheerfully as the rest&quot;. A further example of the lack of humanity and emotion in the Houyhnhnms is that their laws reason that each couple produce two children, one male and one female. In the event that a marriage produced two offspring of the same sex, the parents would take their children to the annual meeting and trade one with a couple who produced two children of the opposite sex. This was viewed as his spoofing and or criticising the notion that the &quot;ideal&quot; family produces children of both sexes. George Orwell viewed the Houyhnhnm society as one whose members try to be as close to dead as possible while alive and matter as little as possible in life and death.

On one hand, the Houyhnhnms have an orderly and peaceful society. They have philosophy and a language that is entirely free of political and ethical nonsense. They have no word for a &quot;lie&quot; (and must substitute a circumlocution: &quot;to say a thing which is not&quot;). They also have a form of art that is derived from nature. Outside &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, Swift had expressed longstanding concern over the corruption of the English language, and he had proposed language reform. He had also, in &quot;Battle of the Books&quot; and in general in &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot;, expressed a preference for the Ancients (Classical authors) because their art was based directly upon nature, and not upon other art.

On the other hand, Swift was profoundly mistrustful of attempts at reason that resulted in either hubris (for example, the Projectors satirised in &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot; or in Book III of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;) or immorality (such as the speaker of &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot;, who offers an entirely logical and wholly immoral proposal for cannibalism). The Houyhnhnms embody both the good and the bad side of reason, for they have the pure language Swift wished for and the amorally rational approach to solving the problems of humanity (Yahoos); the extirpation of the Yahoo population by the horses is very like the speaker of &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot;.

In the shipping lanes he is rescued by a Portuguese sea captain, a level-headed individual albeit full of concern for others, whose temperament at one level appears intermediate between the calm, rational Houyhnhnms of Houyhnhnmland and the norm of corrupt, European humanity, which Gulliver no longer distinguishes from Houyhnhnmland&#x27;s wild Yahoos. Gulliver can speak with him, and though now disaffected from all humanity, he began to tolerate his company. Gulliver is returned to his home and family, finds their smell and look intolerable and all his countrymen no better than &quot;Yahoos&quot;, purchases and converses with two stabled horses, tolerating the stable boy, and assures the reader of his account&#x27;s utter veracity.

<doc id="49329" wikidata="Q867627" url="?curid=49329" title="Strait of Juan de Fuca">
<text>The Strait of Juan de Fuca (officially named Juan de Fuca Strait in Canada) is a body of water about long that is the Salish Sea&#x27;s main outlet to the Pacific Ocean. The international boundary between Canada and the United States runs down the centre of the Strait.

It was named in 1787 by the maritime fur trader Charles William Barkley, captain of &quot;Imperial Eagle&quot;, for Juan de Fuca, the Greek navigator who sailed in a Spanish expedition in 1592 to seek the fabled Strait of Anián. Barkley was the first recorded person to find the strait, unless Juan de Fuca&#x27;s story was true.

Samuel Bawlf posited in 2003 that &quot;Fuca&#x27;s story was nothing more than a fabrication designed to extract money from the English government&quot;. The story would have been based on Francis Drake 1579 exploration of the Northwest Passage at its western end. Drake would therefore have been more than the first European to ever sight the entry of the strait but would also have been the first to sail through when heading West after rounding Vancouver Island, sailing through the Strait of Georgia and sighting the entry to Puget Sound. Much of Bawlf provocative thesis was based on the geographical info that started to leak following Drake return in England and showing up in subsequent maps such as Ortelius. Fuca&#x27;s story would have originated from a pilot named Morera part of Drake expedition that miraculously returned on his own before getting arrested by the Spanish.

While says John Meares named the strait in 1788, most sources say it was Barkley in 1787, for example: ; Existence of the Strait of Juan de Fuca confirmed by Captain Charles Barkley, Washington Secretary of State; online at Google Books; and It is well established that Meares tried to take credit for much of Barkley&#x27;s work.&lt;/ref&gt; The strait was explored in detail between 1789 and 1791 by Manuel Quimper, José María Narváez, Juan Carrasco, Gonzalo López de Haro, and Francisco de Eliza.

==Definition==
The United States Geological Survey defines the Strait of Juan de Fuca as a channel. It extends east from the Pacific Ocean between Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and the Olympic Peninsula, Washington, to Haro Strait, San Juan Channel, Rosario Strait, and Puget Sound. The Pacific Ocean boundary is formed by a line between Cape Flattery and Tatoosh Island, Washington, and Carmanah Point (Vancouver Island), British Columbia. Its northern boundary follows the shoreline of Vancouver Island from Carmanah Point to Gonzales Point, then follows a continuous line east to Seabird Point (Discovery Island), British Columbia, Cattle Point (San Juan Island), Washington, Iceberg Point (Lopez Island), Point Colville (Lopez Island), and then to Rosario Head (Fidalgo Island). The eastern boundary runs south from Rosario Head across Deception Pass to Whidbey Island, then along the western coast of Whidbey Island to Point Partridge, then across Admiralty Inlet to Point Wilson (Quimper Peninsula). The northern coast of the Olympic Peninsula forms the southern boundary of the strait. In the eastern entrance to the Strait, the Race Rocks Archipelago is in the high current zone halfway between Port Angeles, Washington, and Victoria, BC.

==Climate==

Like the rest of the Salish Sea and surrounding regions, the climate of the Strait is disputed, with the Köppen system classifying it as Mediterranean, but most regional climatologists preferring oceanic. While the climate is mostly oceanic in nature, the dry summers result in the Mediterranean classification in the Köppen system. Rainfall ranges from over (temperate rainforest) conditions at the west end to as little as at the east end, near Sequim.

Because it is exposed to the generally westerly winds and waves of the Pacific, seas and weather in Juan de Fuca Strait are, on average, rougher than in the more protected waters inland, thereby resulting in a number of small-craft advisories, gale warnings, and storm warnings.

== Ferries ==

An international vehicle ferry, the , crosses the Strait from Port Angeles, Washington, to Victoria, British Columbia, several times each day. It began operating in 1959, replacing an earlier ferry, and remains privately owned; the &quot;Coho&quot; carried 475,000 passengers and 130,000 vehicles in 2018. A passenger-only ferry on the same route, named the Victoria Express, operated from 1990 to 2011. Victoria is also the terminus of the Victoria Clipper, a passenger-only ferry from Seattle. Sidney, located northeast of Victoria, is served by a seasonal extension the Washington State Ferries system&#x27;s route serving the San Juan Islands and Anacortes, Washington.

==Boundary dispute==
This strait remains the subject of a maritime boundary dispute between Canada and the United States. The dispute is only over the seaward boundary extending west from the mouth of the strait. The maritime boundary within the strait is not in dispute. Both governments have proposed a boundary based on the principle of equidistance, but with different basepoint selections, resulting in small differences in the line. Resolution of the issue should be simple, but has been hindered because it might influence other unresolved maritime boundary issues between Canada and the United States. In addition, the government of British Columbia has rejected both equidistant proposals, instead arguing that the Juan de Fuca submarine canyon is the appropriate &quot;geomorphic and physiogeographic boundary&quot;. The proposed equidistant boundary currently marks the northern boundary of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary. British Columbia&#x27;s position is based on the principle of natural prolongation which developed in international law. It poses a dilemma for the federal government of Canada. If Canada holds that the principle of natural prolongation applies to the Juan de Fuca Canyon on its Pacific Ocean coast, the assertion could undermine Canada&#x27;s argument in the &quot;Gulf of Maine&quot; boundary dispute. In this Atlantic Ocean context, Canada favours an outcome based on the principle of equidistance.

==Salish Sea==
In March 2008, the Chemainus First Nation proposed renaming the strait the &quot;Salish Sea&quot;, an idea that reportedly met with approval by British Columbia&#x27;s Aboriginal Relations Minister Mike de Jong, who pledged to put it before the BC cabinet for discussion. Making &quot;Salish Sea&quot; official required a formal application to the Geographical Names Board of Canada. A parallel American movement promoting the name had a different definition, combining of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound as well as the Strait of Georgia and related waters under the more general name &quot;Salish Sea&quot;. This latter definition was made official in 2009 by geographic boards of Canada and the United States.

In October 2009, the Washington State Board of Geographic Names approved the Salish Sea toponym, not to replace the names of the Strait of Georgia, Puget Sound, and Strait of Juan de Fuca, but instead as a collective term for all three. The British Columbia Geographical Names Office passed a resolution only recommending that the name be adopted by the Geographical Names Board of Canada, should its US counterpart approve the name-change. The United States Board on Geographic Names approved the name on November 12, 2009.

==Fauna==

Certain groups of seabirds called common murre migrate north by swimming. Some Pacific Coast murres paddle north to the sheltered bays of the Strait of Juan de Fuca to feed on herring and other small fish.

Humpback whales can be observed near the western end of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, mostly from June to November, especially in areas near Neah Bay and La Push. There is a resident (non-nomadic) population of killer whale in the Strait and surrounding waters, where they feed on spawning Chinook salmon. The migrating, so-called &quot;transient&quot; populations of killer whale often prey on the California sea lion and Steller&#x27;s sea lion, in addition to the gray whale, another cetacean with both residential and nomadic groups in the Strait. As migratory gray whales swim between Baja California and Alaska each year, they will often be seen in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, feeding on small marine creatures on the seafloor, and using the Strait as a sort of &quot;rest stop&quot; on their long journeys. They also socialize with and encounter the local, non-migratory gray whales in the Strait; from a conservation standpoint, this is vital for the whales&#x27; ability to meet potential new mates, form new bonds, and ultimately create new bloodlines. This yearly influx of whales is best observed between March and May, at the peak of the migration times.

<text>Spellevator is an educational video game for the Apple II published by MECC in 1988.

==Gameplay==
The player controls a dust bunny, which is chased by several vacuum cleaners with different movement patterns. The objective of the level is to grab all the letters and exit through the upper left corner. The player can pass through an unoccupied elevator (some vacuum cleaners use elevators also) by correctly answering a spelling or vocabulary question. Once one completes a level, the player can receive a bonus by correctly unscrambling the letters one grabbed into a word.

&quot;Spellevator&quot; has a utility on the disk&#x27;s flipside that let a user create a word list and save it to any ProDOS formatted floppy disk. This way, teachers could customize the game to fit their own particular vocabulary lists.

==Legacy==
&quot;Spellevator&quot; was followed by &quot;Spellevator Plus&quot; for additional platforms.

<text>Patchwork or &quot;pieced work&quot; is a form of needlework that involves sewing together pieces of fabric into a larger design. The larger design is usually based on repeating patterns built up with different fabric shapes (which can be different colors). These shapes are carefully measured and cut, basic geometric shapes making them easy to piece together. 

==Uses==
Patchwork is often used to make quilts, but it can also be used to make rugs, bags, wall-hangings, warm jackets, cushion covers, skirts, waistcoats and other items of clothing. Some textile artists work with patchwork, often combining it with embroidery and other forms of stitchery.

When used to make a quilt, this larger patchwork or pieced design becomes the &quot;top&quot; of a three-layered quilt, the middle layer being the batting and the bottom layer the backing. To keep the batting from shifting, a patchwork or pieced quilt is often quilted by hand or machine using a running stitch in order to outline the individual shapes that make up the pieced top, or the quilting stitches may be random or highly ordered overall patterns that contrast with the patchwork composition.

==History==

Evidence of patchwork—piecing small pieces of fabric together to create a larger piece and quilting layers of textile fabrics together—has been found throughout history. Patchwork was used by ancient Egyptians for their clothes, wall decorations, draperies and furniture, with oldest depictions from 5,500 years ago (3,400 BCE). Chinese patchwork is storied to have begun by emperor Liu Yu of the Liu Song dynasty. Earliest preserved pieces have been dated from the early Middle Ages, where among other uses layers of quilted fabric were used in the construction of armor—this kept the soldiers warm and protected. Japanese armor was made in a similar fashion.

Using this technique, quilts began to appear in households of the 11th to 13th centuries. As the European climate became colder around this time, the incidence of the use of bed quilts rose, and so developed the practice of embellishing a simple cloth through the creation of pattern and design, alongside the development of decorative quilting. The tradition of making quilts in this fashion was taken to America by the Pilgrims.

===The United States===
Patchwork enjoyed a widespread revival during the Great Depression as a way to recycle worn clothing into warm quilts. Even very small and worn pieces of material are suitable for use in patchwork, although crafters today more often use new 100% cotton fabrics as the basis for their designs. In the US, patchwork declined after World War II but was again revived during the American bicentennial. In the past, hand quilting was often done in a group around a frame. Instead of quilting, the layers are sometimes tied together at regular intervals with pieces of yarn, a practice known as tying or knotting, and which produces a &quot;comforter&quot;.

==== Popularity ====
The 2003 Quilting in America survey estimated that the total value of the American quilting industry was $2.7 billion. International quilting exhibitions attract thousands of visitors, while countless smaller exhibitions are held every weekend in local regions. Active cyber-quilting communities abound on the web; books and magazines on the subject are published in the hundreds every year; and there are many active local quilting guilds and shops in different countries. &quot;Quilt Art&quot; is established as a legitimate artistic medium, with quilted works of art selling for thousands of dollars to corporate buyers and galleries. Quilt historians and quilt appraisers are re-evaluating the heritage of traditional quilting and antique quilts, while superb examples of antique quilts are purchased for large sums by collectors and museums. The American Quilt Study Group is active in promotion of research on the history of quilting.

=== Asia ===
In India Kantha originated from the Sanskrit word &quot;kontha&quot;, which means rags, as the blankets are made out of rags using different scrap pieces of cloth. Nakshi kantha consisting of a running (embroidery) stitch, similar to the Japanese Sashiko is used for decorating and reinforcing the cloth and sewing patterns. Katab work called in Kutch. It is popularly known as Koudhi in Karnataka. Such blankets are given as gifts to newborn babies in many parts of India. Lambani tribes wear skirts with such art.

Patchwork is also done in various parts of Pakistan, especially in the Sindh region, where they call it &quot;ralli&quot;. Pakistani &quot;ralli&quot; quilts are famous all over the subcontinent even in the west. These quilts are a part of their tradition and are made by women. Now these are gaining international recognition even though they have been making them for thousands of years.

Patchwork is also common in Azerbaijan, where it is called &quot;qurama&quot;.

===Egypt===

The history of patchwork is not all recent. Patchwork was used by ancient Egyptians on their clothing and walls. An Egyptian queen, Esi-Mem-Kev, who lived around 980 BCE possessed a patchwork funeral canopy which was found in her tomb.

==Structure==
There are three traditional structures used to construct a patchwork or pieced composition: 1) the block, 2) overall, and 3) strip piecing. Traditional patchwork has identifying names based on the arrangement of colors and shapes.

===Blocks===
Patchwork blocks are pieced squares made up of colored shapes that repeat specific shapes to create patterns within the square or block of, say, light and dark or contrasting colors (motif). The blocks can all repeat the same pattern, or blocks can have several different patterns. The patchwork blocks are typically around . They are sewn together in stacked rows to make a larger composition. Often strips of contrasting fabric forming a lattice separate the patchwork blocks from each other. Some common patchwork block names are Log Cabin, Drunkard&#x27;s Path, Bear&#x27;s Paw, Tulip, and Nine Patch.

A unique form of patchwork quilt is the crazy quilt. Crazy quilting was popular during the Victorian era (mid–late 19th century). The crazy quilt is made up of random shapes of luxurious fabric such as velvets, silks, and brocades and buttons, lace, and other embellishments left over from the gowns they had made for themselves. The patchwork pieces are stitched together forming &quot;crazy&quot; or non-repeat, asymmetric compositions. Fancy embroidery embellishes the seam lines between the individual, pieced shapes. The crazy quilt was a status symbol, as only well-to-do women had a staff to do all the household work, and had the time to sew their crazy quilt. Traditionally, the top was left without lining or batting. Many surviving crazy quilts still have the newspaper and other foundation papers used for piecing.

===Overall===

Overall patchwork designs are incrementally pieced geometric shapes stitched together to form a larger random or composed design. The colored shapes can be randomly pieced or follow a strict order to create a specific effect, e.g. value (light to dark) progressions, or checkerboard effects. Names such as Hit or Miss, Clamshell, back-stitch, needle weave, criss-cross, and Starburst identify some overall patchwork structures.

Round pieces formed by cutting a circle of fabric, gathering the edges with a running stitch and pulling them tightly shut are known as Suffolk puffs in the United Kingdom due to the Suffolk wool used to pad them. In the United States, the pieces are called yo-yos. The origin date of this type of piecework is unknown, but it was popular in the United States during the Great Depression and in the United Kingdom after World War II. These round pieces can be joined with several stitches on the sides to connect other puffs together and form a coverlet or other items. Scrap pieces may be used, or colors may be coordinated into patterns.

===Strip piecing===
Strip piecing involves stitching together pieces of fabric in repeat patterns into long strips and then stitching the strips together lengthwise. The patchwork strips can be alternated with strips of contrasting colors. A typical strip patchwork quilt is the Four Patch pattern.

==Forms==

Specialised forms of patchwork include:
*Cathedral window
*Cutting mat
*Scrap piecework
*Foundation piecework or the closely related
*English paper piecing
*Seminole patchwork
*Hawaiian piecework (primarily applique)
*Stained glass window patchwork, used to simulate the effect of stained glass in church windows. Satin fabrics simulate the colored glass, and black bias binding tape simulates the lead.

<text>Needlework is decorative sewing and textile arts handicrafts. Anything that uses a needle for construction can be called needlework. Needlework may include related textile crafts such as crochet, worked with a hook, or tatting, worked with a shuttle.

Similar abilities often transfer well between different varieties of needlework, such as fine motor skill and knowledge of textile fibers. Some of the same tools may be used in several different varieties of needlework.

==Background==
Needlework was an important fact of women&#x27;s identity during the Victorian age, including embroidery, netting, knitting, crochet, and Berlin wool work. A growing middle class had more leisure time than ever before; printed materials offered homemakers thousands of patterns. Women were still limited to roles in the household, and under the standards of the time a woman working on needle work while entertaining the parlor was considered beautiful. According to one publication from 1843: &quot;Never is beauty and feminine grace so attractive as, when engaged in the honorable discharge of household duties, and domestic cares.&quot;

Fancy work was distinguished from plain sewing and it was a mark of a prosperous and well-managed home to display handmade needlework. While plain sewing was often handed over to servants, even in middle class households, fancy work would often be done while entertaining guests, in the afternoons, evenings, or on Sundays. The types of goods that could be decorated with needlework techniques was limited only by the imagination: knitted boots, embroidered book covers, footstools, lampshades, sofa cushions, fans and on and on.

<doc id="49333" wikidata="Q970594" url="?curid=49333" title="Cultural bias">
<text>Cultural bias is the interpretation and judgment of phenomena by the standards of one&#x27;s own culture. It is sometimes considered a problem central to social and human sciences, such as economics, psychology, anthropology, and sociology. Some practitioners of these fields have attempted to develop methods and theories to compensate for or eliminate cultural bias.

Cultural bias occurs when people of a culture make assumptions about conventions, including conventions of language, notation, proof and evidence. They are then accused of mistaking these assumptions for laws of logic or nature. Numerous such biases exist, concerning cultural norms for color, mate selection, concepts of justice, linguistic and logical validity, the acceptability of evidence, and taboos.

== Psychology ==
Cultural bias has no &quot;a priori&quot; definition. Instead, its presence is inferred from differential performance of socioracial (e.g., Blacks, Whites), ethnic (e.g., Latinos/Latinas, Anglos), or national groups (e.g., Americans, Japanese) on measures of psychological constructs such as cognitive abilities, knowledge or skills (CAKS), or symptoms of psychopathology (e.g., depression). Historically, the term grew out of efforts to explain between group score differences on CAKS tests primarily of African American and Latino/Latina American test takers relative to their White American counterparts and concerns that test scores should not be interpreted in the same manner across those groups in the name of fairness and equality (see also Cognitive dissonance). Although the concept of cultural bias in testing and assessment also pertains to score differences and potential misdiagnoses with respect to a broader range of psychological concepts, particularly in applied psychology and other social and behavioral sciences, this aspect of cultural bias has received less attention in the relevant literature.

Cultural bias in psychological testing refers to the standardized psychological tests that are conducted to determine the level of intelligence among the test-takers. Limitations of such verbal or non-verbal intelligence tests have been observed since their introduction. Many tests have been objected to, as they produced poor results for the ethnic or racial minorities (students), as compared to the racial majorities. There is minimal evidence supporting claims of cultural bias and cross-cultural examination is both possible and done frequently. As discussed above, the learning environment, the questions posed or situations given in the test may be familiar and strange at the same time to students from different backgrounds- the type of ambiguity in which intellectual differences become apparent in individual capacities to resolve the strange-yet-familiar entity.

==Economics==
Cultural bias in economic exchange is often overlooked. A study done at the Northwestern University suggests that the cultural perception that two countries have of each other plays a large factor in the economic activity between them. The study suggests that low bilateral trust between two countries results in less trade, less portfolio investment, and less direct investment. The effect is amplified for goods, as they are more trust-intensive.

==Anthropology==
The concept of culture theory in anthropology explains that cultural bias is a critical piece of human group formation.

===Sociology===
It is thought that societies with conflicting beliefs will more likely have cultural bias, as it is dependent on the group&#x27;s standing in society in which the social constructions affect how a problem is produced. One example of cultural bias within the context of sociology can be seen in a study done at the University of California by Jane R. Mercer of how test &quot;validity&quot;, &quot;bias&quot;, and &quot;fairness&quot; in different cultural belief systems affect one&#x27;s future in a pluralistic society. A definition of the cultural bias was given as &quot;the extent that the test contains cultural content that is generally peculiar to the members of one group but not to the members of another group&quot;, which leads to a belief that &quot;the internal structure of the test will differ for different cultural groups&quot;. In addition, the different types of errors made on culture-biased tests are dependent on different cultural groups. The idea progressed to the conclusion that a non-cultural-test represents the ability of a population as intended and not the abilities of a group that is not represented.

==History==
Cultural bias may also arise in historical scholarship when the standards, assumptions and conventions of the historian&#x27;s own era are anachronistically used to report and to assess events of the past. The tendency is sometimes known as presentism, and is regarded by many historians as a fault to be avoided. Arthur Marwick has argued that &quot;a grasp of the fact that past societies are very different from our own, and... very difficult to get to know&quot; is an essential and fundamental skill of the professional historian; and that &quot;anachronism is still one of the most obvious faults when the unqualified (those expert in other disciplines, perhaps) attempt to do history.&quot;

<text>A bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is a type of transistor that uses both electrons and electron holes as charge carriers. In contrast, a unipolar transistor, such as a field-effect transistor (FET), uses only one kind of charge carrier. A bipolar transistor allows a small current injected at one of its terminals to control a much larger current between the remaining two terminals, making the device capable of amplification or switching.

BJTs use two p–n junctions between two semiconductor types, n-type and p-type, which are regions in a single crystal of material. The junctions can be made in several different ways, such as changing the doping of the semiconductor material as it is grown, by depositing metal pellets to form alloy junctions, or by such methods as diffusion of n-type and p-type doping substances into the crystal. The superior predictability and performance of junction transistors quickly displaced the original point-contact transistor. Diffused transistors, along with other components, are elements of integrated circuits for analog and digital functions. Hundreds of bipolar junction transistors can be made in one circuit at a very low cost.

Bipolar transistor integrated circuits were the main active devices of a generation of mainframe and minicomputers, but most computer systems now use Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits relying on the field-effect transistor (FET). Bipolar transistors are still used for amplification of signals, switching, and in mixed-signal integrated circuits using BiCMOS. Specialized types are used for high voltage switches, for radio-frequency (RF) amplifiers, or for switching high currents.

== Current direction conventions ==
By convention, the direction of current on diagrams is shown as the direction that a positive charge would move. This is called &quot;conventional current&quot;. However, current in metal conductors is generally due to the flow of electrons. Because electrons carry a negative charge, they move in the direction opposite to conventional current. On the other hand, inside a bipolar transistor, currents can be composed of both positively charged holes and negatively charged electrons. In this article, current arrows are shown in the conventional direction, but labels for the movement of holes and electrons show their actual direction inside the transistor.

=== Arrow direction ===
The arrow on the symbol for bipolar transistors indicates the p–n junction between base and emitter and points in the direction in which conventional current travels.

== Function ==
BJTs exist as PNP and NPN types, based on the doping types of the three main terminal regions. An NPN transistor comprises two semiconductor junctions that share a thin p-doped region, and a PNP transistor comprises two semiconductor junctions that share a thin n-doped region. N-type means doped with impurities (such as phosphorus or arsenic) that provide mobile electrons, while p-type means doped with impurities (such as boron) that provide holes that readily accept electrons.

Charge flow in a BJT is due to diffusion of charge carriers (electrons and holes) across a junction between two regions of different charge carrier concentration. The regions of a BJT are called &quot;emitter&quot;, &quot;base&quot;, and &quot;collector&quot;. A discrete transistor has three leads for connection to these regions. Typically, the emitter region is heavily doped compared to the other two layers, and the collector is doped more lightly (typically ten times lighter) than the base. By design, most of the BJT collector current is due to the flow of charge carriers injected from a heavily doped emitter into the base where they are minority carriers (electrons in NPNs, holes in PNPs) that diffuse toward the collector, so BJTs are classified as &quot;minority-carrier devices&quot;.

In typical operation, the base–emitter junction is forward biased, which means that the p-doped side of the junction is at a more positive potential than the n-doped side, and the base–collector junction is reverse biased. When forward bias is applied to the base–emitter junction, the equilibrium between the thermally generated carriers and the repelling electric field of the emitter depletion region is disturbed. This allows thermally excited carriers (electrons in NPNs, holes in PNPs) to inject from the emitter into the base region. These carriers create a diffusion current through the base from the region of high concentration near the emitter toward the region of low concentration near the collector.

To minimize the fraction of carriers that recombine before reaching the collector–base junction, the transistor&#x27;s base region must be thin enough that carriers can diffuse across it in much less time than the semiconductor&#x27;s minority-carrier lifetime. Having a lightly doped base ensures recombination rates are low. In particular, the thickness of the base must be much less than the diffusion length of the carriers. The collector–base junction is reverse-biased, and so negligible carrier injection occurs from the collector to the base, but carriers that are injected into the base from the emitter, and diffuse to reach the collector–base depletion region, are swept into the collector by the electric field in the depletion region. The thin &quot;shared&quot; base and asymmetric collector–emitter doping are what differentiates a bipolar transistor from two &quot;separate&quot; diodes connected in series.

=== Voltage, current, and charge control ===
The collector–emitter current can be viewed as being controlled by the base–emitter current (current control), or by the base–emitter voltage (voltage control). These views are related by the current–voltage relation of the base–emitter junction, which is the usual exponential current–voltage curve of a p–n junction (diode).

The explanation for collector current is the concentration gradient of minority carriers in the base region. Due to low-level injection (in which there are much fewer excess carriers than normal majority carriers) the ambipolar transport rates (in which the excess majority and minority carriers flow at the same rate) is in effect determined by the excess minority carriers.

Detailed transistor models of transistor action, such as the Gummel–Poon model, account for the distribution of this charge explicitly to explain transistor behavior more exactly. The charge-control view easily handles phototransistors, where minority carriers in the base region are created by the absorption of photons, and handles the dynamics of turn-off, or recovery time, which depends on charge in the base region recombining. However, because base charge is not a signal that is visible at the terminals, the current- and voltage-control views are generally used in circuit design and analysis.

In analog circuit design, the current-control view is sometimes used because it is approximately linear. That is, the collector current is approximately formula_1 times the base current. Some basic circuits can be designed by assuming that the base–emitter voltage is approximately constant and that collector current is β times the base current. However, to accurately and reliably design production BJT circuits, the voltage-control model (e.g. the Ebers–Moll model) is required. The voltage-control model requires an exponential function to be taken into account, but when it is linearized such that the transistor can be modeled as a transconductance, as in the Ebers–Moll model, design for circuits such as differential amplifiers again becomes a mostly linear problem, so the voltage-control view is often preferred. For translinear circuits, in which the exponential I–V curve is key to the operation, the transistors are usually modeled as voltage-controlled current sources whose transconductance is proportional to their collector current. In general, transistor-level circuit analysis is performed using SPICE or a comparable analog-circuit simulator, so mathematical model complexity is usually not of much concern to the designer, but a simplified view of the characteristics allows designs to be created following a logical process.

=== Turn-on, turn-off, and storage delay ===
Bipolar transistors, and particularly power transistors, have long base-storage times when they are driven into saturation; the base storage limits turn-off time in switching applications. A Baker clamp can prevent the transistor from heavily saturating, which reduces the amount of charge stored in the base and thus improves switching time.

=== Transistor characteristics: alpha (&quot;α&quot;) and beta (&quot;β&quot;) ===
The proportion of carriers able to cross the base and reach the collector is a measure of the BJT efficiency. The heavy doping of the emitter region and light doping of the base region causes many more electrons to be injected from the emitter into the base than holes to be injected from the base into the emitter. A thin and lightly doped base region means that most of the minority carriers that are injected into the base will diffuse to the collector and not recombine.

==== Common-emitter current gain ====
The &quot;common-emitter current gain&quot; is represented by F or the -parameter FE; it is approximately the ratio of the collector&#x27;s direct current to the base&#x27;s direct current in forward-active region. (The F subscript is used to indicate the forward-active mode of operation.) It is typically greater than 50 for small-signal transistors, but can be smaller in transistors designed for high-power applications. Both injection efficiency and recombination in the base reduce the BJT gain.

==== Common-base current gain ====
Another useful characteristic is the &quot;common-base current gain&quot;, F. The common-base current gain is approximately the gain of current from emitter to collector in the forward-active region. This ratio usually has a value close to unity; between 0.980 and 0.998. It is less than unity due to recombination of charge carriers as they cross the base region.

Alpha and beta are related by the following identities:
: formula_2

Beta is a convenient figure of merit to describe the performance of a bipolar transistor, but is not a fundamental physical property of the device. Bipolar transistors can be considered voltage-controlled devices (fundamentally the collector current is controlled by the base–emitter voltage; the base current could be considered a defect and is controlled by the characteristics of the base–emitter junction and recombination in the base). In many designs beta is assumed high enough so that base current has a negligible effect on the circuit. In some circuits (generally switching circuits), sufficient base current is supplied so that even the lowest beta value a particular device may have will still allow the required collector current to flow.

== Structure ==
BJTs consists of three differently doped semiconductor regions: the &quot;emitter&quot; region, the &quot;base&quot; region and the &quot;collector&quot; region. These regions are, respectively, &quot;p&quot; type, &quot;n&quot; type and &quot;p&quot; type in a PNP transistor, and &quot;n&quot; type, &quot;p&quot; type and &quot;n&quot; type in an NPN transistor. Each semiconductor region is connected to a terminal, appropriately labeled: &quot;emitter&quot; (E), &quot;base&quot; (B) and &quot;collector&quot; (C).

The &quot;base&quot; is physically located between the &quot;emitter&quot; and the &quot;collector&quot; and is made from lightly doped, high-resistivity material. The collector surrounds the emitter region, making it almost impossible for the electrons injected into the base region to escape without being collected, thus making the resulting value of α very close to unity, and so, giving the transistor a large β. A cross-section view of a BJT indicates that the collector–base junction has a much larger area than the emitter–base junction.

The bipolar junction transistor, unlike other transistors, is usually not a symmetrical device. This means that interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the transistor leave the forward active mode and start to operate in reverse mode. Because the transistor&#x27;s internal structure is usually optimized for forward-mode operation, interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the values of α and β in reverse operation much smaller than those in forward operation; often the α of the reverse mode is lower than 0.5. The lack of symmetry is primarily due to the doping ratios of the emitter and the collector. The emitter is heavily doped, while the collector is lightly doped, allowing a large reverse bias voltage to be applied before the collector–base junction breaks down. The collector–base junction is reverse biased in normal operation. The reason the emitter is heavily doped is to increase the emitter injection efficiency: the ratio of carriers injected by the emitter to those injected by the base. For high current gain, most of the carriers injected into the emitter–base junction must come from the emitter.

The low-performance &quot;lateral&quot; bipolar transistors sometimes used in bipolar and MOS integrated circuits are sometimes designed symmetrically, that is, with no difference between forward and backward operation.

Small changes in the voltage applied across the base–emitter terminals cause the current between the &quot;emitter&quot; and the &quot;collector&quot; to change significantly. This effect can be used to amplify the input voltage or current. BJTs can be thought of as voltage-controlled current sources, but are more simply characterized as current-controlled current sources, or current amplifiers, due to the low impedance at the base.

Early transistors were made from germanium but most modern BJTs are made from silicon. A significant minority are also now made from gallium arsenide, especially for very high speed applications (see HBT, below).

The heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) is an improvement of the BJT that can handle signals of very high frequencies up to several hundred GHz. It is common in modern ultrafast circuits, mostly RF systems.

Two commonly used HBTs are silicon–germanium and aluminum gallium arsenide, though a wide variety of semiconductors may be used for the HBT structure. HBT structures are usually grown by epitaxy techniques like MOCVD and MBE.

== Regions of operation ==

Bipolar transistors have four distinct regions of operation, defined by BJT junction biases:
; Forward-active (or simply &quot;active&quot;) : The base–emitter junction is forward biased and the base–collector junction is reverse biased. Most bipolar transistors are designed to afford the greatest common-emitter current gain, βF, in forward-active mode. If this is the case, the collector–emitter current is approximately proportional to the base current, but many times larger, for small base current variations.
; Reverse-active (or &quot;inverse-active&quot; or &quot;inverted&quot;) : By reversing the biasing conditions of the forward-active region, a bipolar transistor goes into reverse-active mode. In this mode, the emitter and collector regions switch roles. Because most BJTs are designed to maximize current gain in forward-active mode, the βF in inverted mode is several times smaller (2–3 times for the ordinary germanium transistor). This transistor mode is seldom used, usually being considered only for failsafe conditions and some types of bipolar logic. The reverse bias breakdown voltage to the base may be an order of magnitude lower in this region.
; Saturation : With both junctions forward biased, a BJT is in saturation mode and facilitates high current conduction from the emitter to the collector (or the other direction in the case of NPN, with negatively charged carriers flowing from emitter to collector). This mode corresponds to a logical &quot;on&quot;, or a closed switch.
; Cut-off : In cut-off, biasing conditions opposite of saturation (both junctions reverse biased) are present. There is very little current, which corresponds to a logical &quot;off&quot;, or an open switch.

Although these regions are well defined for sufficiently large applied voltage, they overlap somewhat for small (less than a few hundred millivolts) biases. For example, in the typical grounded-emitter configuration of an NPN BJT used as a pulldown switch in digital logic, the &quot;off&quot; state never involves a reverse-biased junction because the base voltage never goes below ground; nevertheless the forward bias is close enough to zero that essentially no current flows, so this end of the forward active region can be regarded as the cutoff region.

=== Active-mode transistors in circuits ===
The diagram shows a schematic representation of an NPN transistor connected to two voltage sources. (The same description applies to a PNP transistor with reversed directions of current flow and applied voltage.) This applied voltage causes the lower p–n junction to become forward biased, allowing a flow of electrons from the emitter into the base. In active mode, the electric field existing between base and collector (caused by &quot;V&quot;CE) will cause the majority of these electrons to cross the upper p–n junction into the collector to form the collector current &quot;I&quot;C. The remainder of the electrons recombine with holes, the majority carriers in the base, making a current through the base connection to form the base current, &quot;I&quot;B. As shown in the diagram, the emitter current, &quot;I&quot;E, is the total transistor current, which is the sum of the other terminal currents, (i.e. &quot;I&quot;E = &quot;I&quot;B + &quot;I&quot;C).

In the diagram, the arrows representing current point in the direction of conventional current – the flow of electrons is in the opposite direction of the arrows because electrons carry negative electric charge. In active mode, the ratio of the collector current to the base current is called the &quot;DC current gain&quot;. This gain is usually 100 or more, but robust circuit designs do not depend on the exact value (for example see op-amp). The value of this gain for DC signals is referred to as formula_3, and the value of this gain for small signals is referred to as formula_4. That is, when a small change in the currents occurs, and sufficient time has passed for the new condition to reach a steady state formula_4 is the ratio of the change in collector current to the change in base current. The symbol formula_6 is used for both formula_3 and formula_4.

The emitter current is related to formula_9 exponentially. At room temperature, an increase in formula_9 by approximately 60 mV increases the emitter current by a factor of 10. Because the base current is approximately proportional to the collector and emitter currents, they vary in the same way.

== History ==
The bipolar point-contact transistor was invented in December 1947 at the Bell Telephone Laboratories by John Bardeen and Walter Brattain under the direction of William Shockley. The junction version known as the bipolar junction transistor (BJT), invented by Shockley in 1948, was for three decades the device of choice in the design of discrete and integrated circuits. Nowadays, the use of the BJT has declined in favor of CMOS technology in the design of digital integrated circuits. The incidental low performance BJTs inherent in CMOS ICs, however, are often utilized as bandgap voltage reference, silicon bandgap temperature sensor and to handle electrostatic discharge.

=== Germanium transistors ===
The germanium transistor was more common in the 1950s and 1960s but has a greater tendency to exhibit thermal runaway. Since germanium p-n junctions have a lower forward bias than silicon, germanium transistors turn on at lower voltage.

=== Early manufacturing techniques ===
Various methods of manufacturing bipolar transistors were developed.
* Point-contact transistor – first transistor ever constructed (December 1947), a bipolar transistor, limited commercial use due to high cost and noise.
** Tetrode point-contact transistor – Point-contact transistor having two emitters. It became obsolete in the middle 1950s.

** Epitaxial transistor a bipolar junction transistor made using vapor-phase deposition. See Epitaxy. Allows very precise control of doping levels and gradients.

== Theory and modeling ==

BJTs can be thought of as two diodes (p–n junctions) sharing a common region that minority carriers can move through. A PNP BJT will function like two diodes that share an N-type cathode region, and the NPN like two diodes sharing a P-type anode region. Connecting two diodes with wires will not make a BJT, since minority carriers will not be able to get from one p–n junction to the other through the wire.

Both types of BJT function by letting a small current input to the base control an amplified output from the collector. The result is that the BJT makes a good switch that is controlled by its base input. The BJT also makes a good amplifier, since it can multiply a weak input signal to about 100 times its original strength. Networks of BJTs are used to make powerful amplifiers with many different applications.

In the discussion below, focus is on the NPN BJT. In what is called active mode, the base–emitter voltage formula_9 and collector–base voltage formula_12 are positive, forward biasing the emitter–base junction and reverse-biasing the collector–base junction. In this mode, electrons are injected from the forward biased n-type emitter region into the p-type base where they diffuse as minority carriers to the reverse-biased n-type collector and are swept away by the electric field in the reverse-biased collector–base junction.

For an illustration of forward and reverse bias, see semiconductor diodes.

=== Large-signal models ===
In 1954, Jewell James Ebers and John L. Moll introduced their mathematical model of transistor currents:

==== Ebers–Moll model ====


The DC emitter and collector currents in active mode are well modeled by an approximation to the Ebers–Moll model:
: formula_13

The base internal current is mainly by diffusion (see Fick&#x27;s law) and
: formula_14
where
* formula_15 is the thermal voltage formula_16 (approximately 26 mV at 300 K ≈ room temperature).
* formula_17 is the emitter current
* formula_18 is the collector current
* formula_19 is the common base forward short-circuit current gain (0.98 to 0.998)
* formula_20 is the reverse saturation current of the base–emitter diode (on the order of 10−15 to 10−12 amperes)
* formula_9 is the base–emitter voltage
* formula_22 is the diffusion constant for electrons in the p-type base
* &quot;W&quot; is the base width

The formula_23 and forward formula_6 parameters are as described previously. A reverse formula_6 is sometimes included in the model.

The unapproximated Ebers–Moll equations used to describe the three currents in any operating region are given below. These equations are based on the transport model for a bipolar junction transistor.
: formula_26
where
* formula_27 is the collector current
* formula_28 is the base current
* formula_29 is the emitter current
* formula_1 is the forward common emitter current gain (20 to 500)
* formula_31 is the reverse common emitter current gain (0 to 20)
* formula_32 is the reverse saturation current (on the order of 10−15 to 10−12 amperes)
* formula_33 is the thermal voltage (approximately 26 mV at 300 K ≈ room temperature).
* formula_34 is the base–emitter voltage
* formula_35 is the base–collector voltage

===== Base-width modulation =====

As the collector–base voltage (formula_36) varies, the collector–base depletion region varies in size. An increase in the collector–base voltage, for example, causes a greater reverse bias across the collector–base junction, increasing the collector–base depletion region width, and decreasing the width of the base. This variation in base width often is called the &quot;Early effect&quot; after its discoverer James M. Early.

Narrowing of the base width has two consequences:
* There is a lesser chance for recombination within the &quot;smaller&quot; base region.
* The charge gradient is increased across the base, and consequently, the current of minority carriers injected across the emitter junction increases.

Both factors increase the collector or &quot;output&quot; current of the transistor in response to an increase in the collector–base voltage.

===== Punchthrough =====
When the base–collector voltage reaches a certain (device-specific) value, the base–collector depletion region boundary meets the base–emitter depletion region boundary. When in this state the transistor effectively has no base. The device thus loses all gain when in this state.

==== Gummel–Poon charge-control model ====
The Gummel–Poon model is a detailed charge-controlled model of BJT dynamics, which has been adopted and elaborated by others to explain transistor dynamics in greater detail than the terminal-based models typically do. This model also includes the dependence of transistor formula_6-values upon the direct current levels in the transistor, which are assumed current-independent in the Ebers–Moll model.

=== Small-signal models ===

==== Hybrid-pi model ====

The hybrid-pi model is a popular circuit model used for analyzing the small signal and AC behavior of bipolar junction and field effect transistors. Sometimes it is also called &quot;Giacoletto model&quot; because it was introduced by L.J. Giacoletto in 1969. The model can be quite accurate for low-frequency circuits and can easily be adapted for higher-frequency circuits with the addition of appropriate inter-electrode capacitances and other parasitic elements.

==== h-parameter model ====
Another model commonly used to analyze BJT circuits is the &quot;h-parameter&quot; model, also known as the hybrid equivalent model, closely related to the hybrid-pi model and the y-parameter two-port, but using input current and output voltage as independent variables, rather than input and output voltages. This two-port network is particularly suited to BJTs as it lends itself easily to the analysis of circuit behavior, and may be used to develop further accurate models. As shown, the term &quot;x&quot; in the model represents a different BJT lead depending on the topology used. For common-emitter mode the various symbols take on the specific values as:
* Terminal 1, base
* Terminal 2, collector
* Terminal 3 (common), emitter; giving &quot;x&quot; to be &quot;e&quot;
* &quot;i&quot;i, base current (&quot;i&quot;b)
* &quot;i&quot;o, collector current (&quot;i&quot;c)
* &quot;V&quot;in, base-to-emitter voltage (&quot;V&quot;BE)
* &quot;V&quot;o, collector-to-emitter voltage (&quot;V&quot;CE)
and the h-parameters are given by:
* &quot;h&quot;ix = &quot;h&quot;ie for the common-emitter configuration, the input impedance of the transistor (corresponding to the base resistance &quot;r&quot;pi).
* &quot;h&quot;rx = &quot;h&quot;re, a reverse transfer relationship, it represents the dependence of the transistor&#x27;s (input) &quot;I&quot;B–&quot;V&quot;BE curve on the value of (output) &quot;V&quot;CE. It is usually very small and is often neglected (assumed to be zero) at DC.
* &quot;h&quot;fx = &quot;h&quot;fe, the &quot;forward&quot; current-gain of the transistor, sometimes written &quot;h21&quot;. This parameter, with lower case &quot;fe&quot; to imply small signal (AC) gain, or more often with capital letters for &quot;FE&quot; (specified as &quot;h&quot;FE) to mean the &quot;large signal&quot; or DC current-gain (&quot;β&quot;DC or often simply &quot;β&quot;), is one of the main parameters in datasheets, and may be given for a typical collector current and voltage or plotted as a function of collector current. See below.
* &quot;h&quot;ox = 1/&quot;h&quot;oe, the output impedance of transistor. The parameter &quot;h&quot;oe usually corresponds to the output admittance of the bipolar transistor and has to be inverted to convert it to an impedance.

As shown, the h-parameters have lower-case subscripts and hence signify AC conditions or analyses. For DC conditions they are specified in upper-case. For the CE topology, an approximate h-parameter model is commonly used which further simplifies the circuit analysis. For this the &quot;h&quot;oe and &quot;h&quot;re parameters are neglected (that is, they are set to infinity and zero, respectively). The h-parameter model as shown is suited to low-frequency, small-signal analysis. For high-frequency analyses the inter-electrode capacitances that are important at high frequencies must be added.

===== Etymology of &quot;h&quot;FE =====
The &quot;h&quot; refers to its being an h-parameter, a set of parameters named for their origin in a &quot;hybrid equivalent circuit&quot; model (see above). As with all h parameters, the choice of lower case or capitals for the letters that follow the &quot;h&quot; is significant; lower-case signifies &quot;small signal&quot; parameters, that is, the slope the particular relationship; upper-case letters imply &quot;large signal&quot; or DC values, the ratio of the voltages or currents. In the case of the very often used &quot;h&quot;FE:
* &quot;F&quot; is from &quot;Forward current amplification&quot; also called the current gain. 
* &quot;E&quot; refers to the transistor operating in a &quot;common Emitter&quot; (CE) configuration. 
So hFE (or hFE) refers to the (total; DC) collector current divided by the base current, and is dimensionless. It is a parameter that varies somewhat with collector current, but is often approximated as a constant; it is normally specified at a typical collector current and voltage, or graphed as a function of collector current.

Had capital letters not been used for used in the subscript, i.e. if it were written &quot;hfe&quot; the parameter indicate small signal (AC) current gain, i.e. the slope of the Collector current versus Base current graph at a given point, which is often close to the hFE value unless the test frequency is high.

=== Industry models ===
The Gummel–Poon SPICE model is often used, but it suffers from several limitations. For instance, reverse breakdown of the base–emitter diode is not captured by the SGP (SPICE Gummel–Poon) model, neither are thermal effects (self-heating) or quasi-saturation. These have been addressed in various more advanced models which either focus on specific cases of application (Mextram, HICUM, Modella) or are designed for universal usage (VBIC).

== Applications ==
The BJT remains a device that excels in some applications, such as discrete circuit design, due to the very wide selection of BJT types available, and because of its high transconductance and output resistance compared to MOSFETs.

The BJT is also the choice for demanding analog circuits, especially for very-high-frequency applications, such as radio-frequency circuits for wireless systems.

=== High-speed digital logic ===
Emitter-coupled logic (ECL) use BJTs.

Bipolar transistors can be combined with MOSFETs in an integrated circuit by using a BiCMOS process of wafer fabrication to create circuits that take advantage of the application strengths of both types of transistor.

=== Amplifiers ===
The transistor parameters α and β characterize the current gain of the BJT. It is this gain that allows BJTs to be used as the building blocks of electronic amplifiers. The three main BJT amplifier topologies are:
* Common emitter
* Common base
* Common collector

=== Temperature sensors ===
Because of the known temperature and current dependence of the forward-biased base–emitter junction voltage, the BJT can be used to measure temperature by subtracting two voltages at two different bias currents in a known ratio.

=== Logarithmic converters ===
Because base–emitter voltage varies as the logarithm of the base–emitter and collector–emitter currents, a BJT can also be used to compute logarithms and anti-logarithms. A diode can also perform these nonlinear functions but the transistor provides more circuit flexibility.

=== Avalanche pulse generators ===
Transistors may be deliberately made with a lower collector to emitter breakdown voltage than the collector to base breakdown voltage. If the emitter–base junction is reverse biased the collector emitter voltage may be maintained at a voltage just below breakdown. As soon as the base voltage is allowed to rise, and current flows avalanche occurs and impact ionization in the collector base depletion region rapidly floods the base with carriers and turns the transistor fully on. So long as the pulses are short enough and infrequent enough that the device is not damaged, this effect can be used to create very sharp falling edges.

Special avalanche transistor devices are made for this application.

<text>The trucker&#x27;s hitch is a compound knot commonly used for securing loads on trucks or trailers. The general arrangement, using loops and turns in the rope itself to form a crude block and tackle, has long been used to tension lines and is known by multiple names. Knot author Geoffrey Budworth claims the knot can be traced back to the days when s and hawkers used horse-drawn conveyances to move their wares from place to place.

==Variations==
The portion of the trucker&#x27;s hitch which differs in the following variations is the method used to form the loop which the working end slides through to produce the mechanical advantage. The different methods of forming the loop affect the ease and speed of tying and releasing, and the stability of the final product.

The variations are presented in order of increasing stability.

===Sheepshank style loop===
This version of the knot uses a sheepshank, in this kind of application also known as a &quot;bell ringer&#x27;s knot&quot;, to form the loop. It is quicker to make than a fixed loop, but is less dependable. It is avoided in critical applications (such as securing a load on a truck) as it can fall apart under too little load or too much load, and can capsize if not dressed properly. However, this knot may be made secure by adding a Half Hitch to the top bight of the Sheepshank. This form of the trucker&#x27;s hitch is least likely to jam, coming apart easily once tension is released. Different sources show slight variations in the way the sheepshank portion is formed and dressed.

Versions popular in East Asia use variations of sheep shank using either a simple half hitch or a double turn self crossing half hitch or a triple turn self crossing half hitch. A sheep shank with two consecutive half hitches i.e. a clove hitch to secure the upper eye and to form the lower eye is more popular in the west.

===Slipped overhand loop===
The loop formed in one version is a simple Slipped Overhand Loop. This version is good for light to moderate loads

===Simple friction loop===
Another version uses a multiply twisted bight to pass a bight of the working end to form the eye of the loop. This version tolerates higher load. 

===Fixed loop===
The most reliable common variation uses a fixed loop, such as an alpine butterfly loop, artillery loop, figure-eight loop or directional figure-eight loop, or another of many suitable loop knots. If a fixed loop is used repeatedly for tying the trucker&#x27;s hitch in the same portion of rope, excessive wear or other damage may be suffered by the portion of the loop which working end slides against.

If extra loops are used to form the eye it tends to ease untying. In order to prevent the closing of the loop under load, the loop must be formed by the working end of the rope (which will later pass through the loop). If the standing end goes through the loop, it will close under load.

==Finishing the hitch==

In tightening the trucker&#x27;s hitch, tension can be effectively increased by repeatedly pulling sideways while preventing the tail end from slipping through the loop, and then cinching the knot tighter as the sideways force is released. This is called &quot;sweating a line&quot;.

If the tail end is wrapped through the last loop twice, the resulting friction may render manual cinching unnecessary.

Once tight, the trucker&#x27;s hitch is often secured with a half hitch, usually slipped for easy releasing and to avoid the necessity of access to the end of the rope, though a more secure finish, such as two half-hitches, may be called for. Under large loads, the finishing half hitch can jam, especially if it is not slipped; the difficulty of releasing it can be compounded by the fact that the knot is typically still under tension when it is to be untied.

Finishing with a taut-line hitch or a Farrimond friction hitch to the standing part allows the finishing knot to be tied and untied with no tension. This eliminates any jamming problems and also allows the line to be re-tensioned if necessary.

A mechanical advantage of ideally 3:1 can nearly be achieved when using an equivalent setup with pulleys, but is reduced substantially by friction when using knots.

== Cultural references ==

The trucker&#x27;s hitch knot is portrayed by comedy duo Ylvis in their 2014 song with the same name. The lyrics and the video pretend (in a humorous way) to demonstrate how to tie the knot.

<text>The hangman&#x27;s knot or hangman&#x27;s noose (also known as a collar during the Elizabethan era) is a knot most often associated with its use in hanging a person.

== Function ==
This knot was typically used as a method of capital punishment. The pull on the knot at end of the gallows often resulted in a cervical fracture. Another method intended to result in the mass of the knot crushing closed (occluding) neck arteries, causing cessation of brain circulation, which was not always rapid. The knot is non-jamming but tends to resist attempts to loosen it.

==In culture==
Surviving nooses in the United Kingdom show simple slipknots that were superseded in the late 19th century with a metal eye spliced into one end of the rope, the noose being formed by passing the other end through it. The classic hangman&#x27;s knot was largely developed in the United States. Filmed hangings of war criminals in Europe after World War II, conducted under US jurisdiction, show such knots placed in various locations.
Each additional coil adds friction to the knot, which makes the noose harder to pull closed or open. When Grover Cleveland was the sheriff of Erie County, he performed two hangings. Cleveland was advised by a more experienced Sheriff to grease the rope with tallow and run it through the knot a few times to ensure rapid closure with the drop. The number of coils should therefore be adjusted depending on the intended use, the type and thickness of rope, and environmental conditions such as wet or greasy rope. One coil makes it equivalent to the simple running knot.

Woody Guthrie sings of the hangman using thirteen coils:

&lt;poem&gt;Did you ever see a hangman tie a hangknot?
I&#x27;ve seen it many a time and he winds, he winds,
After thirteen times he&#x27;s got a hangknot.&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>The thief knot resembles the reef knot (square knot) except that the free, or bitter ends are on opposite sides. It is said that sailors would secure their belongings in a using the thief knot, often with the ends hidden. If another sailor went through the bag, the odds were high the thief would tie the bag back using the more common reef knot, revealing the tampering, hence the name. It is difficult to tie by mistake, unlike the granny knot, unless one attempts to tie a square knot in a similar manner to a sheet bend (which is the correct way to tie a thief knot), then it is possible to tie accidentally.

The thief knot is much less secure than the already insecure reef knot. It unties itself if the lines are pulled when the same action would seize a reef knot.

<doc id="49364" wikidata="Q202849" url="?curid=49364" title="Turner syndrome">
<text>Turner syndrome (TS), commonly known as 45,X, or 45,X0, is a chromosomal disorder in which female cells have only one X chromosome instead of two, or are partially missing an X chromosome (sex chromosome monosomy) leading to the complete or partial deletion of the pseudoautosomal regions (PAR1, PAR2) in the affected X chromosome. Typically, people have two sex chromosomes (XX for females or XY for males). The chromosomal abnormality is often present in just some cells, in which case it is known as Turner syndrome with mosaicism. 45,X0 with mosaicism can occur in males or females, but Turner syndrome without mosaicism only occurs in females. Signs and symptoms vary among those affected but often include additional skin folds on the neck, arched palate, low-set ears, low hairline at the nape of the neck, short stature, and lymphedema of the hands and feet. Those affected do not normally develop menstrual periods or mammary glands without hormone treatment and are unable to reproduce without assistive reproductive technology. Small chin (micrognathia), loose folds of skin on the neck, slanted eyelids and prominent ears are found in Turner syndrome, though not all will show it. Heart defects, Type II diabetes, and hypothyroidism occur in the disorder more frequently than average. Most people with Turner syndrome have normal intelligence; however, many have problems with spatial visualization that can hinder learning mathematics. Ptosis (droopy eyelids) and conductive hearing loss also occur more often than average.
Turner syndrome is caused by one X chromosome (45,X), a ring X chromosome, 45,X/46,XX mosaicism, or a small piece of the Y chromosome in what should be an X chromosome. They may have a total of 45 chromosomes or will not develop menstrual periods due to loss of ovarian function genes. Their karyotype often lacks Barr bodies due to lack of a second X or may have Xp deletions. it occurs during formation of the reproductive cells in a parent or in early cell division during development. No environmental risks are known, and the mother&#x27;s age does not play a role. While most people have 46 chromosomes, people with Turner syndrome usually have 45 in some or all cells. In cases of mosaicism, the symptoms are usually fewer, and possibly none occur at all. Diagnosis is based on physical signs and genetic testing.
No cure for Turner syndrome is known. Treatment may help with symptoms. Human growth hormone injections during childhood may increase adult height. Estrogen replacement therapy can promote development of the breasts and hips. Medical care is often required to manage other health problems with which Turner syndrome is associated.
Turner syndrome occurs in between one in 2,000 and one in 5,000 females at birth. All regions of the world and cultures are affected about equally. Generally people with Turner syndrome have a shorter life expectancy, mostly due to heart problems and diabetes. American endocrinologist Henry Turner first described the condition in 1938. In 1964, it was determined to be due to a chromosomal abnormality.
==Presentation==
Turner syndrome is associated with a number of physical features, including short stature, heart defects, webbed neck, micrognathia, amenorrhoea, and infertility. The phenotype of Turner syndrome is affected by mosaicism, where cell lines with a single sex chromosome are combined with those with multiple. Individuals with mosaicism of 45,X0/46,XY may be phenotypically male, female, or ambiguous, while those with 45,X0/46,XX will be phenotypically female. Patients with 45,X0/46,XY do not receive the diagnosis of Turner syndrome if phenotypically male. Around 40%–50% of cases of Turner syndrome are true &quot;monosomy X&quot; with a 45,X0 karyotype, while the remainder are mosaic for another cell line, most commonly 46,XX, or have other structural abnormalities of the X chromosome. The classic features of Turner syndrome, while distinctive, may be rarer than previously thought; incidental diagnosis, such as in biobank samples or prenatal testing for older mothers, finds many girls and women with few traditional signs of Turner syndrome.

===Physiological===
====Stature====

Turner syndrome is associated with short stature. The mean adult height of women with Turner syndrome without growth hormone therapy is around shorter than the mean of women in the general population. Mosaicism affects height in Turner syndrome; a large population sample drawn from the UK Biobank found women with 45,X0 karyotypes to have an average height of , while those with 45,X0/46,XX karyotypes averaged . The strength of the association between Turner syndrome and short stature is such that idiopathic short stature alone is a major diagnostic indication.

Growth delay in Turner syndrome does not begin at birth; most neonates with the condition have a birth weight in the lower end of the normal range. Height begins to lag in toddlerhood, with a delayed growth velocity becoming apparent as early as 18 months. Marked short stature becomes obvious in mid-childhood. In undiagnosed preadolescents and adolescents, growth delay may be mistaken for a side effect of delayed puberty and improperly treated. 

Short stature in Turner syndrome and its counterpoint, tall stature in sex chromosome polysomy conditions such as Klinefelter syndrome, XYY syndrome, and trisomy X, is caused by the short-stature homeobox gene on the X and Y chromosomes. The absence of a copy of the &quot;SHOX&quot; gene in Turner&#x27;s inhibits skeletal growth, resulting both in overall short stature and in a distinctive pattern of skeletal malformations including micrognathia (small chin), cubitus valgus (abnormal forearm angles), and shorter fingers.

When Turner syndrome is diagnosed in early life, growth hormone therapy can decrease the degree of short stature. Treatment with human growth hormone appears to increase expected adult height by approximately from an otherwise expected norm of –. The effects of growth hormone therapy are at their strongest during the first year of treatment and taper off over time. In some cases oxandrolone, a steroid with a relatively mild masculinizing effect, may be used alongside growth hormone. The addition of oxandrolone to a Turner syndrome treatment regimen adds around to the final height. Oxandrolone is used particularly often in girls diagnosed later in their growth period, due to the reduced impact of growth hormone alone in this population. However, oxandrolone use runs the risk of delayed breast development, voice deepening, increased body hair, or clitoromegaly.

====Physical features====

In addition to short stature, Turner syndrome is associated with a number of characteristic physical features. These include a short, webbed neck, low hairline, small chin and lower jaw, arched palate, and broad chest with widely-spaced nipples. Lymphedema (swelling) of the hands and feet is common at birth and sometimes persistent throughout the lifespan.

A number of the external manifestations of Turner syndrome are focused on the limbs, hands, and feet. Lymphedema at birth is one of the classic features of the syndrome; though it often resolves during toddlerhood, recurrence in later life is frequent, often without apparent cause. Cases where the retained X chromosome was inherited from the mother more often experience lymphedema than those where it was from the father. As a consequence of lymphedema&#x27;s effects on nail anatomy, females with Turner syndrome frequently have small, hypoplastic, upturned nails. Their fingers are shorter and the hands are broad. Their feet are puffy, thicker, and swollen. Shortened metacarpal bones, particularly the fourth metacarpal, are a frequent finding. The body shape of individuals with Turner syndrome is frequently quite broad and stocky, as the growth deficiency is more pronounced in the length of bones than in their width. Scoliosis is common in Turner syndrome, and is seen in 40% of girls without growth hormone treatment.

Facial features associated with Turner syndrome include 
broad, prominent ears, a low hairline at the nape of the neck, a webbed neck, a small chin with dental malocclusion, and downslanting palpebral fissures (the opening between the eyelids). These are thought to be related to lymphedema during the fetal period, specifically to the presence and resorption of excess fluids in the head and neck region. Neck webbing is a particularly distinctive trait of Turner syndrome, leading to many neonatal diagnoses. The underlying etiology of neck webbing is related to prenatal blood flow issues, and even in populations without Turner&#x27;s has broad health consequences; the rate of congenital heart disease in webbed neck is 150-fold higher than in the general population, while the feature is also associated with reduced height and minor developmental impairments. Some women with Turner syndrome have premature facial wrinkling. Acne is less common in teenage girls and women with Turner syndrome, though the reasons why are unclear.
Other physical features connected to the condition include long eyelashes, sometimes including an additional set of eyelashes, and unusual dermatoglyphics (fingerprints). Some women with Turner&#x27;s report being unable to create fingerprint passwords due to hypoplastic dermatoglyphics. Unusual dermatoglyphics are common to chromosome anomalies like Down Syndrome. and in the case of Turner&#x27;s may be a consequence of fetal lymphedema. Keloid scars, or raised hypertrophic scars growing beyond the boundaries of the original wound, are potentially associated with Turner syndrome; however, the association is underresearched. Though traditional medical counselling on the topic urges conservatism about elective procedures such as ear piercing due to the risk of severe scarring, the actual consequences are unclear. Keloids in Turner syndrome are particularly frequent following surgical procedures to reduce neck webbing. Turner syndrome has been associated with unusual patterns of hair growth, such as patches of short and long hair. Armpit and pubic hair is often sparse, while arm and leg hair is often thick. Though armpit hair is reduced in amount and thickness, the pattern in which it is implanted in the skin is as in men, rather than as in women.

====Cardiac====

Approximately half of individuals with Turner syndrome have congenital heart defects. CHDs associated with Turner syndrome include bicuspid aortic valves (30%), coarctation of the aorta (15%), and abnormalities of the arteries in the head and neck. A rare but potentially fatal complication of heart defects in Turner syndrome is aortic dissection, where the inner layer of the aorta tears open. Aortic dissection is six times as common in females with Turner syndrome as the general population and accounts for 8% of all deaths in the syndrome. The risk is substantially increased for individuals with bicuspid aortic valves, who make up 95% of patients with aortic dissection compared to 30% of all Turner&#x27;s patients, and coarctation of the aorta, who make up 90% and 15% respectively.

Coronary artery disease onsets earlier in life in women with Turner syndrome compared to controls, and mortality from cardiac events is increased. This is thought to be in part a function of the relationship between Turner syndrome and obesity; women with Turner syndrome have a higher percentage of body fat for their weight than control women, and their short stature makes weight control more difficult. Though coronary artery disease is frequently thought a disease of older adults, young women with Turner syndrome are more likely to develop the disease than their 46,XX peers. Treatment recommendations for women with Turner syndrome and coronary artery disease are as in the general population, but as Turner&#x27;s increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, women with insulin resistance must weigh up the benefits of prophylactic or early statin treatment with the risk of Type II diabetes.

====Internal medicine====
Turner syndrome is associated with a broad variety of health considerations, such as liver and kidney issues, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Liver dysfunction is common in women with Turner syndrome, with 50–80% having elevated liver enzymes. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is increased in prevalence in Turner syndrome, likely related in part to both conditions&#x27; associations with obesity. Hepatic vascular diseases are also seen in the syndrome as an aspect of Turner syndrome&#x27;s broader vascular, aortic and cardiac impacts. Primary biliary cholangitis is more common in 45,X0 than 46,XX women. An unclear association exists between estrogen replacement therapy and liver dysfunction in Turner syndrome; some studies imply estrogen therapy worsens such conditions, while others imply improvement.
Kidney issues, such as horseshoe kidney, are sometimes observed in Turner syndrome. Horseshoe kidney, where the kidneys are fused together in a U-shape, occurs in around 10% of Turner&#x27;s cases compared to less than 0.5% of the general population. A missing kidney is observed in as many as 5% of individuals with Turner syndrome, compared to around 0.1% of the population. A duplicated ureter, where two ureters drain a single kidney, occurs in as much as 20–30% of the Turner syndrome population. Kidney malformations ( horseshoe kidney, etc.) in Turner syndrome may be more common in mosaicism than in the full 45,X karyotype. Serious complications of the kidney anomalies associated with Turner syndrome are rare, although there is some risk of issues such as obstructive uropathy, where the flow of urine from the kidneys is blocked.

Women with Turner syndrome are more likely than average to have high blood pressure; as many as 60% of women with the condition are hypertensive. Isolated diastolic hypertension often precedes systolic hypertension in the condition and may develop at a young age. Treatments for hypertension in Turner syndrome are as in the general population.

Approximately 25–80% of women with Turner syndrome have some level of insulin resistance, and a minority develop type 2 diabetes. The risk of diabetes in Turner syndrome varies by karyotype and appears to be raised by specific deletions of the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp). One study found that while a relatively low 9% of women with Xq (long arm) deletions had type 2 diabetes, 18% of those with full 45,X0 karyotypes did, as well as 23% with Xp deletions. 43% of women with isochromosome Xq, who both lacked the short arm and had an additional copy of the long arm, developed type 2 diabetes. Though part of the diabetes risk in Turner syndrome is a function of weight control, some is independent; age- and weight-matched women with non-Turner&#x27;s ovarian failure have a lower diabetes risk than in Turner syndrome. Growth hormone treatment plays an unclear role in diabetes risk, as does estrogen supplementation.

The association between Turner syndrome and other diseases, such as cancer, is unclear. Overall, women with Turner syndrome do not appear more likely to develop cancer than women with 46,XX karyotypes, but the specific pattern of what cancers are highest risk seems to differ. The risk of breast cancer appears lower in Turner&#x27;s than in control women, perhaps due to decreased levels of estrogen. Neuroblastoma, a cancer of infancy and early childhood, has been reported in girls with Turner syndrome. Tumours of the nervous system, both the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system, are overrepresented amongst cancers in Turner syndrome. Furthermore, about 5.5% of Turner syndrome individuals have an extra, abnormal small supernumerary marker chromosome (sSMC) which consists of part of a Y chromosome. This partial Y chromosome-bearing sSMC may include the &quot;SRY&quot; gene located on the p arm of the Y chromosome at band 11.2 (notated as Yp11.2). This gene encodes the testis-determining factor protein (also known as sex-determining region Y protein). Turner syndrome individuals with this &quot;SRY&quot; gene-containing sSMC have a very real increased risk of developing gonadal tissue neoplasms such as gonadoblastomas and in situ seminomas (also termed dysgerminomas to indicate that this tumor has the pathology of the testicular tumor, seminoma, but develops in ovaries). In one study, 34 Turner syndrome girls without overt evidence of these tumors were found at preventative surgery to have a gonadoblastoma (7 cases), dysgerminoma (1 case), or non-specific &quot;in situ&quot; gonadal neoplasm (1 case). Turner syndrome girls with this sSMC otherwise have typical features of the Turner syndrome except for a minority who also have hirsutism and/or clitoral enlargement. Surgical removal of the gonads has been recommended to remove the threat of developing these sSMC-associated neoplasms. Turner syndrome individuals with an sSMC that lacks the &quot;SRY&quot; gene are not at an increased risk of developing these cancers.

====Sensory====

Hearing loss is common in Turner syndrome. Though at birth hearing is normal with good hearing abilities, chronic middle ear infections are frequent throughout childhood, which can cause permanent conductive hearing loss or deafness. Deaf individuals with Turner syndrome may use speech-reading, sign language, and cochlear implants. In adulthood, sensorineural hearing loss occurs more often than in 46,XX women and at younger ages; though differing thresholds of hearing loss make it difficult to compare between studies, younger adult women with Turner syndrome are routinely found to have disproportionate rates of hearing issues, with sometimes up to half of women in their 20s and 30s having difficulty hearing well. This hearing loss is progressive; at the age of 40, women with Turner syndrome have equivalent hearing loss to 46,XX women aged 60, on average. Cohort studies imply hearing loss may be more common in women who also have metabolic syndrome. The high prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss in Turner syndrome appears to be related to &quot;SHOX&quot; deficiency.

Ocular and visual disorders are also increased in prevalence in Turner syndrome. More than half of individuals with Turner syndrome have some form of eye disorder. This may be a consequence of shared genes on the X chromosome in both visual and ovarian development. Nearly half of cases have hyperopia or myopia, usually mild. Strabismus, or misalignment of the eye, occurs in around one-fifth to one-third of girls with Turner syndrome. As with strabismus outside the Turner&#x27;s context, it may be treated with glasses, patching, or surgical correction. Esotropia, where the eye turns inwards, is more common than exotropia, where it turns outwards. Ptosis, or a drooping eyelid, is a common facial manifestation of Turner syndrome; it usually has no appreciable impact on vision, but severe cases may limit visual range and require surgical correction. The rate of red-green colourblindness in Turner syndrome is 8%, the same as in XY males. This is due to red-green colourblindness being an X-linked recessive condition; in people with a single X chromosome, whether normal males or Turner females, only a single mutated X is necessary for symptoms. Red-green colourblindness may be underdiagnosed in the Turner context, as the rarity of the condition in females reduces the likelihood of screening, and practitioners may not connect that the karyotype of Turner syndrome increases the risk from the female baseline.

====Autoimmune====
Women with Turner syndrome are two to three times as likely to develop autoimmune disorders as the general population. Specific autoimmune disorders linked to Turner syndrome include Hashimoto&#x27;s disease, vitiligo, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, alopecia,Type I diabetes, and celiac disease Type I diabetes, when the immune system attacks the beta cells in the pancreas, is a major autoimmune disorder and is much more common in Turner females than 46,XX and 47,XXX females in most cases. Inflammatory bowel disease is also common, while the prevalence of type 1 diabetes is unclear, though appears increased.

Thyroid disease is common in Turner syndrome. Hypothyroidism is prevalent; 30%–50% of women with Turner syndrome have Hashimoto&#x27;s disease, where the thyroid gland is slowly destroyed by an autoimmune reaction from the immune system. By age 50, half of women with Turner syndrome have subclinical or clinical hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism and Graves&#x27; disease are also increased in prevalence, though more modestly. The Turner&#x27;s presentation of hyperthyroidism is as in the general population, while the presentation of hypothyroidism is often atypical, with a mild early presentation yet a more severe progression. Women with isochromosome Xq are more likely to develop autoimmune thyroid disease than women with other forms of Turner syndrome.

The risk of irritable bowel syndrome is increased around fivefold in Turner syndrome, and that of ulcerative colitis around fourfold. Celiac disease is also increased in prevalence, with around 4–8% of Turner&#x27;s patients having comorbid celiac disease compared to 0.5–1% of the general population. Diagnosis of such conditions is difficult due to their nonspecific early symptoms. In the Turner&#x27;s context, diagnosis may in particular be missed due to growth delay; such conditions cause growth delay and failure to thrive when they onset in childhood, but as girls with Turner syndrome already have such delay, symptoms may be overlooked and ascribed to the original condition.

Alopecia areata, or recurrent patchy hair loss, is three times as common in Turner syndrome as the general population. Alopecia in the Turner syndrome context is frequently treatment-resistant, also seen in other chromosome aneuploidies such as Down syndrome. Psoriasis is common in Turner syndrome, although the precise prevalence is unclear. Turner&#x27;s psoriasis may be related to growth hormone treatment, as psoriasis as a side effect of such therapies has been reported in patients without the karyotype. Psoriasis may progress to psoriatic arthritis, and this progression may be more common in Turner syndrome. Vitiligo has been reported in conjunction with Turner syndrome, but the risk is unclear and may be a side effect of increased clinical attention to autoimmune disease in this population.

====Puberty====

Puberty is delayed or absent in Turner syndrome. A 2019 literature review found that 13% of women with a 45,X0 karyotype could expect to experience spontaneous thelarche (breast development), while 9% would undergo spontaneous menarche (beginning of menstruation). These numbers were higher in women with mosaic Turner&#x27;s; 63% with 45,X0/46,XX karyotypes experienced spontaneous thelarche and 39% spontaneous menarche, while 88% with 45,X0/47,XXX (the presence of a trisomy X cell line) experienced spontaneous thelarche and 66% spontaneous menarche. Unexpectedly, women with Y-chromosome cells also had increased rates of thelarche and menarche compared to the 45,X baseline, at 41% and 19%. However, few women with trisomy X or Y-chromosome cell lines were covered in the review, impeding extrapolation from these results. 6% of women with Turner syndrome have regular menstrual cycles; the rest experience primary or secondary amenorrhea or other menstrual dysfunction.

In girls with Turner syndrome who do not experience spontaneous puberty, exogenous estrogen is used to induce and maintain feminization. Estrogen replacement is recommended to begin at around age 11–12, although some parents prefer to delay the induction of puberty in girls with lower social and emotional preparedness. The dose of estrogen in induced puberty begins at 10% of adult estrogen levels and is steadily increased at six-month intervals, with a full adult dose attained two to three years after the beginning of treatment. Estrogen replacement may interfere with growth hormone therapy, due to the closing effects of estrogen on growth plates; individuals must weigh up their preferences for taller height versus greater feminization.

====Fertility====
Women with Turner syndrome are at extremely high risk for primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and infertility. Although about 70–80% have no spontaneous pubertal development and 90% experience primary amenorrhea, the remainder may possess a small residual of ovarian follicles at birth or early childhood.

Early in gestation, fetuses with Turner syndrome have a normal number of gametes in their developing ovaries, but this starts decreasing rapidly as early as 18 weeks of pregnancy; by birth, girls with the condition have markedly reduced follicular counts. Women with Turner syndrome who wish to raise families but are incapable of conception with their own oocytes have the options of adoption or of pregnancy with donor eggs; the latter has a comparable success rate to donor pregnancy in women with 46,XX karyotypes.

Pregnancy in Turner syndrome is inherently high-risk; the maternal death rate is 2%.

Usually, estrogen replacement therapy is used to spur the growth of secondary sexual characteristics at the time when puberty should onset. While very few women with Turner syndrome menstruate spontaneously, estrogen therapy requires a regular shedding of the uterine lining (&quot;withdrawal bleeding&quot;) to prevent its overgrowth. Withdrawal bleeding can be induced monthly, like menstruation, or less often, usually every three months, if the patient desires. Estrogen therapy does not make a woman with nonfunctional ovaries fertile, but it plays an important role in assisted reproduction; the health of the uterus must be maintained with estrogen if an eligible woman with Turner Syndrome wishes to use IVF (using donated oocytes).

Especially in mosaic cases of Turner syndrome that contains Y-chromosome (e.g., 45,X/46,XY) due to the risk of development of ovarian malignancy (most common is gonadoblastoma) gonadectomy is recommended. Turner syndrome is characterized by primary amenorrhoea, premature ovarian failure (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism), streak gonads and infertility (however, technology (especially oocyte donation) provides the opportunity of pregnancy in these patients). Failure to develop secondary sex characteristics (sexual infantilism) is typical.

===Cognition===

====Neurodevelopmental====
Individuals with Turner syndrome have normal intelligence. Verbal IQ is usually higher than performance IQ; one review of thirteen studies found an average verbal IQ of 101 compared to an average performance IQ of 89.

People with Turner syndrome demonstrate relative strengths in verbal skills, but may exhibit weaker nonverbal skills – particularly in arithmetic, select visuospatial skills, and processing speed. They have difficulties with directional sense, visualization of three-dimensional shapes, properties of shapes, and symmetry and may have dyscalculia. Turner syndrome does not typically cause intellectual disability or impair cognition. However, learning difficulties are common among women with Turner syndrome, particularly a specific difficulty in perceiving spatial relationships, such as nonverbal learning disorder. This may also manifest itself as a difficulty with motor control or with mathematics. While it is not correctable, in most cases it does not cause difficulty in daily living. Most Turner syndrome patients are employed as adults and lead productive lives.

Also, a rare variety of Turner syndrome, known as &quot;Ring-X Turner syndrome&quot;, has about a 60% association with intellectual disability. This variety accounts for around 2–4% of all Turner syndrome cases.

==== Psychological ====
Social difficulties appear to be an area of vulnerability for TS girls. Counseling affected individuals and their families about the need to carefully develop social skills and relationships may prove useful in advancing social adaptation. Women with Turner syndrome may experience adverse psychosocial outcomes which can be improved through early intervention and the provision of appropriate psychological and psychiatric care. Genetic, hormonal, and medical problems associated with Turner syndrome are likely to affect psychosexual development of female adolescent patients, and thus influence their psychological functioning, behavior patterns, social interactions, and learning ability. Although Turner syndrome constitutes a chronic medical condition, with possible physical, social, and psychological complications in a woman&#x27;s life, hormonal and estrogen replacement therapy, and assisted reproduction, are treatments that can be helpful for Turner syndrome patients and improve their quality of life. Research shows a possible association between age at diagnosis and increased substance use and depressive symptoms. 

=== Prenatal ===
Despite the excellent postnatal prognosis, 99% of Turner syndrome conceptions are thought to end in miscarriage or stillbirth, and as many as 15% of all spontaneous abortions have the 45,X karyotype. Among cases that are detected by routine amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, one study found that the prevalence of Turner syndrome among tested pregnancies was 5.58 and 13.3 times higher, respectively, than among live neonates in a similar population.

== Cause ==
Turner syndrome is caused by the complete or partial absence of one copy of the X chromosome in some or all the cells. The abnormal cells may have only one X (monosomy) (45,X) or they may be affected by one of several types of partial monosomy like a deletion of the short p arm of one X chromosome (46,X,del(Xp)) or the presence of an isochromosome with two q arms (46,X,i(Xq)) Turner syndrome has distinct features due to the lack of pseudoautosomal regions, which are typically spared from X-inactivation. In mosaic individuals, cells with X monosomy (45,X) may occur along with cells that are normal (46,XX), cells that have partial monosomies, or cells that have a Y chromosome (46,XY). The presence of mosaicism is estimated to be relatively common in affected individuals (67–90%).

The (46,X,i(Xq) isochromosome in the Turner syndrome is classified as a small supernumerary marker chromosome (sSMC). Two of the types of sSMCs in this syndrome contain parts of the genetic material from either an X or, much less frequently, Y chromosome and may or may not contain an &quot;XIST&quot; gene. Turner syndrome females with (46,X,i(Xq) sSMC consisting of a partial X chromosome that does not contain the &quot;XIST&quot; gene express at least some of this sSMC&#x27;s genetic material and therefore contain excesses of this material. In consequence, they have a more serious form of the Turner syndrome that ranges form moderately severe to extremely severe. The extremely severe cases have anencephaly (absence of a major portion of the brain, skull, and scalp), agenesis of the corpus callosum (lack of the thick tract of nerve fibers that connect the left and right cerebral hemispheres), and complex heart deformities. Individuals with Turner syndrome that have partial X chromosome containing(46,X,i(Xq) sSMCs that have the &quot;XIST&quot; gene do not express this sSMC&#x27;s genetic material and do not have the more severe manifestations of the syndrome.

=== Inheritance ===
In the majority of cases where monosomy occurs, the X chromosome comes from the mother. This may be due to a nondisjunction in the father. Meiotic errors that lead to the production of X with p arm deletions or abnormal Y chromosomes are also mostly found in the father. Isochromosome X or ring chromosome X on the other hand are formed equally often by both parents. Overall, the functional X chromosome usually comes from the mother.

In most cases, Turner syndrome is a sporadic event, and for the parents of an individual with Turner syndrome the risk of recurrence is not increased for subsequent pregnancies. Rare exceptions may include the presence of a balanced translocation of the X chromosome in a parent, or where the mother has 45,X mosaicism restricted to her germ cells.

== Diagnosis ==

=== Prenatal ===

Turner syndrome may be diagnosed by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling during pregnancy.

Usually, fetuses with Turner syndrome can be identified by abnormal ultrasound findings (&quot;i.e.&quot;, heart defect, kidney abnormality, cystic hygroma, ascites). In a study of 19 European registries, 67.2% of prenatally diagnosed cases of Turner syndrome were detected by abnormalities on ultrasound. 69.1% of cases had one anomaly present, and 30.9% had two or more anomalies.

An increased risk of Turner syndrome may also be indicated by abnormal triple or quadruple maternal serum screen. The fetuses diagnosed through positive maternal serum screening are more often found to have a mosaic karyotype than those diagnosed based on ultrasonographic abnormalities, and conversely, those with mosaic karyotypes are less likely to have associated ultrasound abnormalities.

=== Postnatal ===
Turner syndrome can be diagnosed postnatally at any age. Often, it is diagnosed at birth due to heart problems, an unusually wide neck or swelling of the hands and feet. However, it is also common for it to go undiagnosed for several years, often until the girl reaches the age of puberty and fails to develop typically (the changes associated with puberty do not occur). In childhood, a short stature can be indicative of Turner syndrome.

A test called a karyotype, also known as a chromosome analysis, analyzes the chromosomal composition of the individual. This is the test of choice to diagnose Turner syndrome.

== Treatment ==
As a chromosomal condition, there is no cure for Turner syndrome. However, much can be done to minimize the symptoms. While most of the physical findings are harmless, significant medical problems can be associated with the syndrome. Most of these significant conditions are treatable with surgery and other therapies including hormonal therapy.
* Synthetic growth hormones, either alone or with a low dose of androgen, will increase height by several inches and probably final adult height. Growth hormone is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of Turner syndrome and is covered by many insurance plans. It can make Turner females achieve a more normal height There is evidence that this is effective, even in toddlers. A 2019 systematic review comparing effects of adding oxandrolone to growth hormone treatment to growth hormone alone has found moderate-quality evidence that the addition of oxandrolone leads to an increase in final adult height of girls with Turner syndrome. When the same review assessed the effects of adding Oxandrolone to growth hormone treatment on speech, cognition and psychological status, the results were inconclusive due to very-low quality evidence.
* Estrogen replacement therapy such as the birth control pill, has been used since the condition was described in 1938 to promote development of secondary sexual characteristics. Estrogens are crucial for maintaining good bone integrity, cardiovascular health and tissue health. Women with Turner syndrome who do not have spontaneous puberty and who are not treated with estrogen are at high risk for osteoporosis and heart conditions.
* Modern reproductive technologies have also been used to help women with Turner syndrome become pregnant if they desire. For example, a donor egg can be used to create an embryo, which is carried by the Turner syndrome woman.
* Uterine maturity is positively associated with years of estrogen use, history of spontaneous menarche, and negatively associated with the lack of current hormone replacement therapy.

== Epidemiology ==
Turner syndrome occurs in between one in 2,000 and one in 5,000 females at birth.

Approximately 99 percent of fetuses with Turner syndrome spontaneously terminate during the first trimester. Turner syndrome accounts for about 10 percent of the total number of spontaneous abortions in the United States.

== History ==
The syndrome is named after Henry Turner, an American endocrinologist, who described it in 1938. In Europe, it is often called &quot;Ullrich–Turner syndrome&quot; and was sometimes called &quot;Bonnevie–Ullrich syndrome&quot; although the latter term is rarely used today. Both syndrome names acknowledge(d) that earlier cases had also been described 1930 by European doctors Kristine Bonnevie and Otto Ullrich. In Russian and Soviet literature, it is called &quot;Shereshevsky–Turner syndrome&quot; to acknowledge that the condition was first described as hereditary in 1925 by the Soviet endocrinologist , who believed that it was due to the underdevelopment of the gonads and the anterior pituitary gland and was combined with congenital malformations of internal development.

The first published report of a female with a 45,X karyotype was in 1959 by Charles Ford and colleagues in Harwell near Oxford, and Guy&#x27;s Hospital in London. It was found in a 14-year-old girl with signs of Turner syndrome.

== Cultural &amp; social impacts ==
In many cultures, the symptoms of Turner Syndrome—particularly short stature and infertility—carried social stigmas. Historically, women who were unable to conceive were often marginalized or considered undesirable as wives. While the understanding of TS has improved, the psychological impact of infertility remains a significant concern for many women with the condition. In modern times, advocacy groups have played a vital role in raising awareness and offering support to those with TS, helping to reduce stigma and provide better access to medical care.

<text>The LGM-30 Minuteman is an American land-based intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in service with the Air Force Global Strike Command. , the LGM-30G (Version 3) is the only land-based ICBM in service in the United States and represents the land leg of the U.S. nuclear triad, along with the Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) and nuclear weapons carried by long-range strategic bombers.

Development of the Minuteman began in the mid-1950s when basic research indicated that a solid-fuel rocket motor could stand ready to launch for long periods of time, in contrast to liquid-fueled rockets that required fueling before launch and so might be destroyed in a surprise attack. The missile was named for the colonial minutemen of the American Revolutionary War, who could be ready to fight on short notice.

The Minuteman entered service in 1962 as a deterrence weapon that could hit Soviet cities with a second strike and countervalue counterattack if the U.S. was attacked. However, the development of the United States Navy (USN) UGM-27 Polaris, which addressed the same role, allowed the Air Force to modify the Minuteman, boosting its accuracy enough to attack hardened military targets, including Soviet missile silos. The Minuteman II entered service in 1965 with a host of upgrades to improve its accuracy and survivability in the face of an anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system the Soviets were known to be developing. In 1970, the Minuteman III became the first deployed ICBM with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV): three smaller warheads that improved the missile&#x27;s ability to strike targets defended by ABMs. However, the Minutemen III missiles were later &quot;de-MIRVed&quot;; since 2016 they have had only a single warhead per missile, either a W78 (335 kT) or W87 (300 kT).

By the 1970s, 1,000 Minuteman missiles were deployed. This force has shrunk to 400 Minuteman III missiles , deployed in missile silos around Malmstrom AFB, Montana; Minot AFB, North Dakota; and Francis E. Warren AFB, Wyoming. The Minuteman III will be progressively replaced by the new LGM-35 Sentinel ICBM, to be built by Northrop Grumman, beginning in 2030.

== History ==
=== Edward Hall and solid fuels ===
Minuteman owes its existence largely to Air Force Colonel Edward N. Hall, who in 1956 was given charge of the solid-fuel-propulsion division of General Bernard Schriever&#x27;s Western Development Division, created to lead development of the SM-65 Atlas and HGM-25A Titan I ICBMs. Solid fuels were already commonly used in short-range rockets. Hall&#x27;s superiors were interested in short- and medium-range missiles with solids, especially for use in Europe where the fast reaction time was an advantage for weapons that might be attacked by Soviet aircraft. But Hall was convinced that they could be used for a true ICBM with a range.

To achieve the required energy, that year Hall began funding research at Boeing and Thiokol into the use of ammonium perchlorate composite propellant. Adapting a concept developed in the UK, they cast the fuel into large cylinders with a star-shaped hole running along the inner axis. This allowed the fuel to burn along the entire length of the cylinder, rather than just the end as in earlier designs. The increased burn rate meant increased thrust. This also meant the heat was spread across the entire motor, instead of the end, and because it burned from the inside out it did not reach the wall of the missile fuselage until the fuel was finished burning. In comparison, older designs burned primarily from one end to the other, meaning that at any instant one small section of the fuselage was being subjected to extreme loads and temperatures.

Guidance of an ICBM is based not only on the direction the missile is traveling but the precise instant that thrust is cut off. Too much thrust and the warhead will overshoot its target, too little and it will fall short. Solids are normally very hard to predict in terms of burn time and their instantaneous thrust during the burn, which made them questionable for the sort of accuracy required to hit a target at intercontinental range. While this initially appeared to be an insurmountable problem, it ended up being solved in an almost trivial fashion. A series of ports were added inside the rocket nozzle that were opened when the guidance systems called for engine cut-off. The reduction in pressure was so abrupt that the remaining fuel broke up and blew out the nozzle without contributing to the thrust.

The first to use these developments was the US Navy. It had been involved in a joint program with the US Army to develop the liquid-fueled PGM-19 Jupiter, but had always been skeptical of the system. The Navy felt that liquid fuels were too dangerous to use onboard ships, especially submarines. Rapid success in the solids development program, combined with Edward Teller&#x27;s promise of much lighter nuclear warheads during Project Nobska, led the Navy to abandon Jupiter and begin development of their own solid-fuel missile. Aerojet&#x27;s work with Hall was adapted for their UGM-27 Polaris starting in December 1956.

===Missile farm concept===
The US Air Force saw no pressing need for a solid fuel ICBM. Development of the SM-65 Atlas and SM-68 Titan ICBMs was progressing, and &quot;storable&quot; (hypergolic) liquid propellants were being developed that would allow missiles to be left in a ready-to-shoot form for extended periods. These could be placed in missile silos for added protection, and launch in minutes. This met their need for a weapon that would be safe from sneak attacks; hitting all of the silos within a limited time window before they could launch simply did not seem possible.

But Hall saw solid fuels not only as a way to improve launch times or survivability, but part of a radical plan to greatly reduce the cost of ICBMs so that thousands could be built. He envisioned a future where ICBMs were the primary weapon of the US, not in the supporting role of &quot;last ditch backup&quot; as the Air Force saw them at the time. This would require huge deployments, which would not be possible with existing weapons due to their high cost and operational manpower requirements. A solid fuel design would be simpler to build, and easier to maintain.

Hall&#x27;s ultimate plan was to build a number of integrated missile &quot;farms&quot; that included factories, missile silos, transport and recycling. He was aware that new computerized assembly lines would allow continual production, and that similar equipment would allow a small team to oversee operations for dozens or hundreds of missiles, radically reducing the manpower requirements. Each farm would support between 1,000 and 1,500 missiles being produced in a continuous low rate cycle. Systems in a missile would detect failures, at which point it would be removed and recycled, while a newly built missile would take its place. The missile design was based purely on lowest possible cost, reducing its size and complexity because &quot;the basis of the weapon&#x27;s merit was its low cost per completed mission; all other factors – accuracy, vulnerability, and reliability – were secondary.&quot;

Hall&#x27;s plan did not go unopposed, especially by the more established names in the ICBM field. Ramo-Wooldridge pressed for a system with higher accuracy, but Hall countered that the missile&#x27;s role was to attack Soviet cities, and that &quot;a force which provides numerical superiority over the enemy will provide a much stronger deterrent than a numerically inferior force of greater accuracy.&quot; Hall was known for his &quot;friction with others&quot; and in 1958 Schriever removed him from the Minuteman project, sending him to the UK to oversee deployment of the Thor IRBM. On his return to the US in 1959, Hall retired from the Air Force. He received his second Legion of Merit in 1960 for his work on solid fuels.

Although he was removed from the Minuteman project, Hall&#x27;s work on cost reduction had already produced a new design of diameter, much smaller than the Atlas and Titan at , which meant smaller and cheaper silos. Hall&#x27;s goal of dramatic cost reduction was a success, although many of the other concepts of his missile farm were abandoned.

===Guidance system===

Previous long-range missiles used liquid fuels that could be loaded only just prior to firing. The loading process took from 30 to 60 minutes in typical designs. Although lengthy, this was not considered to be a problem at the time, because it took about the same amount of time to spin up the inertial guidance system, set the initial position, and program in the target coordinates.

Minuteman was designed from the outset to be launched in minutes. While solid fuel eliminated the fueling delays, the delays in starting and aligning the guidance system remained. For the desired quick launch, the guidance system would have to be kept running and aligned at all times. This was a serious problem for the mechanical systems, especially the gyroscopes which used ball bearings.

Autonetics had an experimental design using air bearings that they claimed had been running continually from 1952 to 1957. Autonetics further advanced the state of the art by building the platform in the form of a ball which could rotate in two directions. Conventional solutions used a shaft with ball bearings at either end that allowed it to rotate around a single axis only. Autonetics&#x27; design meant that only two gyros would be needed for the inertial platform, instead of the typical three.

The last major advance was to use a general-purpose digital computer in place of the analog or custom designed digital computers. Previous missile designs normally used two single-purpose and very simple electromechanical computers; one ran the autopilot that kept the missile flying along a programmed course, and the second compared the information from the inertial platform to the target coordinates and sent any needed corrections to the autopilot. To reduce the total number of parts used in Minuteman, a single faster computer was used, running separate subroutines for these functions.

Since the guidance program would not be running while the missile sat in the silo, the same computer was also used to run a program that monitored the various sensors and test equipment. With older designs this had been handled by external systems, requiring miles of extra wiring and many connectors to locations where test instruments could be connected during servicing. Now these could all be accomplished by communicating with the computer through a single connection. In order to store multiple programs, the computer, the D-17B, was built in the form of a drum machine but used a hard disk in place of the drum.

Building a computer with the required performance, size and weight demanded the use of transistors, which were at that time very expensive and not very reliable. Earlier efforts to use computers for guidance, BINAC and the system on the SM-64 Navaho, had failed and were abandoned. The Air Force and Autonetics spent millions on a program to improve transistor and component reliability 100 times, leading to the &quot;Minuteman high-rel parts&quot; specifications. The techniques developed during this program were equally useful for improving all transistor construction, and greatly reduced the failure rate of transistor production lines in general. This improved yield, which had the effect of greatly lowering production costs, had enormous spin-off effects in the electronics industry.

Using a general-purpose computer also had long-lasting effects on the Minuteman program and the US&#x27;s nuclear stance in general. With Minuteman, the targeting could be easily changed by loading new trajectory information into the computer&#x27;s hard drive, a task that could be completed in a few hours. Earlier ICBMs&#x27; custom wired computers, on the other hand, could have attacked only a single target, whose precise trajectory information was hard-coded directly in the system&#x27;s logic.

===Missile gap===
In 1957, a series of intelligence reports suggested the Soviet Union was far ahead in the missile race and would be able to overwhelm the US by the early 1960s. If the Soviets were building missiles in the numbers being predicted by the CIA and others within the defense establishment, by as early as 1961 they would have enough to attack all SAC and ICBM bases in the US in a single first strike. It was later demonstrated that this &quot;missile gap&quot; was just as fictional as the &quot;bomber gap&quot; of a few years earlier, but through the late 1950s, it was a serious concern.

The Air Force responded by beginning research into survivable strategic missiles, starting the WS-199 program. Initially, this focused on air-launched ballistic missiles, which would be carried aboard aircraft flying far from the Soviet Union, and thus impossible to attack by either ICBM, because they were moving, or long-range interceptor aircraft, because they were too far away. In the shorter term, looking to rapidly increase the number of missiles in its force, Minuteman was given crash development status starting in September 1958. Advanced surveying of the potential silo sites had already begun in late 1957.

Adding to their concerns was a Soviet anti-ballistic missile system which was known to be under development at Sary Shagan. WS-199 was expanded to develop a maneuvering reentry vehicle (MARV), which greatly complicated the problem of shooting down a warhead. Two designs were tested in 1957, Alpha Draco and the Boost Glide Reentry Vehicle. These used long and skinny arrow-like shapes that provided aerodynamic lift in the high atmosphere, and could be fitted to existing missiles like Minuteman.

The shape of these reentry vehicles required more room on the front of the missile than a traditional reentry vehicle design. To allow for this future expansion, the Minuteman silos were revised to be built deeper. Although Minuteman would not deploy a boost-glide warhead, the extra space proved invaluable in the future, as it allowed the missile to be extended and carry more fuel and payload.

===Polaris===

During Minuteman&#x27;s early development, the Air Force maintained the policy that the manned strategic bomber was the primary weapon of nuclear war. Blind bombing accuracy on the order of was expected, and the weapons were sized to ensure even the hardest targets would be destroyed as long as the weapon fell within this range. The USAF had enough bombers to attack every military and industrial target in the USSR and was confident that its bombers would survive in sufficient numbers that such a strike would utterly destroy the country.

Soviet ICBMs upset this equation to a degree. Their accuracy was known to be low, on the order of , but they carried large warheads that would be useful against Strategic Air Command&#x27;s bombers, which parked in the open. Since there was no system to detect the ICBMs being launched, the possibility was raised that the Soviets could launch a sneak attack with a few dozen missiles that would take out a significant portion of SAC&#x27;s bomber fleet.

In this environment, the Air Force saw their own ICBMs not as a primary weapon of war, but as a way to ensure that the Soviets would not risk a sneak attack. ICBMs, especially newer models that were housed in silos, could be expected to survive an attack by a single Soviet missile. In any conceivable scenario where both sides had similar numbers of ICBMs, the US forces would survive a sneak attack in sufficient numbers to ensure the destruction of all major Soviet cities in return. The Soviets would not risk an attack under these conditions.

Considering this &quot;countervalue&quot; attack concept, strategic planners calculated that an attack of &quot;400 equivalent megatons&quot; aimed at the largest Soviet cities would promptly kill 30% of their population and destroy 50% of their industry. Larger attacks raised these numbers only slightly, as all of the larger targets would already have been hit. This suggested that there was a &quot;finite deterrent&quot; level around 400 megatons that would be enough to prevent a Soviet attack no matter how many missiles they had of their own. All that had to be ensured was that the US missiles survived, which seemed likely given the low accuracy of the Soviet weapons. Reversing the problem, the addition of ICBMs to the US Air Force&#x27;s arsenal did not eliminate the need, or desire, to attack Soviet military targets, and the Air Force maintained that bombers were the only suitable platform in that role.

Into this argument came the Navy&#x27;s UGM-27 Polaris. Launched from submarines, Polaris was effectively invulnerable and had enough accuracy to attack Soviet cities. If the Soviets improved the accuracy of their missiles this would present a serious threat to the Air Force&#x27;s bombers and missiles, but none at all to the Navy&#x27;s submarines. Based on the same 400 equivalent megatons calculation, they set about building a fleet of 41 submarines carrying 16 missiles each, giving the Navy a finite deterrent that was unassailable.

This presented a serious problem for the Air Force. They were still pressing for the development of newer bombers, like the supersonic B-70, for attacks against military targets, but this role seemed increasingly unlikely in a nuclear war scenario. A February 1960 memo by RAND, entitled &quot;The Puzzle of Polaris&quot;, was passed around among high-ranking Air Force officials. It suggested that Polaris negated any need for Air Force ICBMs if they were also being aimed at Soviet cities. If the role of the missile was to present an unassailable threat to the Soviet population, Polaris was a far better solution than Minuteman. The document had long-lasting effects on the future of the Minuteman program, which, by 1961, was firmly evolving towards a counterforce capability.

===Kennedy===
Minuteman&#x27;s final tests coincided with the start of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s presidency. His new Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, was tasked with continuing the expansion and modernisation of the US nuclear deterrent while limiting spending. McNamara began to apply cost/benefit analysis, and Minuteman&#x27;s low production cost ensured its selection. Atlas and Titan were soon scrapped, and the storable liquid fueled Titan II deployment was severely curtailed. McNamara also cancelled the XB-70 bomber project.

Minuteman&#x27;s low cost had spin-off effects on non-ICBM programs. The Army&#x27;s LIM-49 Nike Zeus, an interceptor missile capable of shooting down Soviet warheads, provided another way to prevent a sneak attack. This had initially been proposed as a way to defend the SAC bomber fleet. The Army argued that upgraded Soviet missiles might be able to attack US missiles in their silos, and Zeus would be able to blunt such an attack. Zeus was expensive and the Air Force said it was more cost-effective to build another Minuteman missile. Given the large size and complexity of the Soviet liquid-fueled missiles, an ICBM building race was one the Soviets could not afford. Zeus was canceled in 1963.

===Counterforce===

Minuteman&#x27;s selection as the primary Air Force ICBM was initially based on the same &quot;second strike&quot; logic as their earlier missiles: that the weapon was primarily one designed to survive any potential Soviet attack and ensure they would be hit in return. But Minuteman had a combination of features that led to its rapid evolution into the US&#x27;s primary weapon of nuclear war.

Chief among these qualities was its digital computer, the D-17B. This could be updated in the field with new targets and better information about the flight paths with relative ease, gaining accuracy for little cost. One of the unavoidable effects on the warhead&#x27;s trajectory was the mass of the Earth, which contains many mass concentrations that pull on the warhead as it passes over them. Through the 1960s, the Defense Mapping Agency (now part of National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency) mapped these with increasing accuracy, feeding that information back into the Minuteman fleet. The Minuteman was initially deployed with a circular error probable (CEP) of about , but this had improved to about by 1965. This was accomplished without any mechanical changes to the missile or its navigation system.

At those levels, the ICBM begins to approach the manned bomber in terms of accuracy; a small upgrade, roughly doubling the accuracy of the INS, would give it the same CEP as the manned bomber. Autonetics began such development even before the original Minuteman entered fleet service, and the Minuteman II had a CEP of . Additionally, the computers were upgraded with more memory, allowing them to store information for eight targets, which the missile crews could select among almost instantly, greatly increasing their flexibility. From that point, Minuteman became the US&#x27;s primary deterrent weapon, until its performance was matched by the Navy&#x27;s Trident missile of the 1980s.

Questions about the need for the manned bomber were quickly raised. The Air Force began to offer a number of reasons why the bomber offered value, in spite of costing more money to buy and being much more expensive to operate and maintain. Newer bombers with better survivability, like the B-70, cost many times more than the Minuteman, and, in spite of great efforts through the 1960s, became increasingly vulnerable to surface-to-air missiles. The B-1 of the early 1970s eventually emerged with a price tag around $200 million (equivalent to $ million in ) while the Minuteman IIIs built during the 1970s cost only $7 million ($ million in ).

The Air Force countered that having a variety of platforms complicated the defense; if the Soviets built an effective anti-ballistic missile system of some sort, the ICBM and SLBM fleet might be rendered useless, while the bombers would remain. This became the nuclear triad concept, which survives into the present. Although this argument was successful, the number of manned bombers has been repeatedly cut and the deterrent role increasingly passed to missiles.

=== Minuteman I (LGM-30A/B or SM-80/HSM-80A) ===
:&quot;See also W56 Warhead&quot;

==== Deployment ====
The LGM-30A Minuteman I was first test-fired on 1 February 1961 at Cape Canaveral, entering into the Strategic Air Command&#x27;s arsenal in 1962. After the first batch of Minuteman I&#x27;s were fully developed and ready for stationing, the United States Air Force (USAF) had originally decided to put the missiles at Vandenberg AFB in California, but before the missiles were set to officially be moved there it was discovered that this first set of Minuteman missiles had defective boosters which limited their range from their initial to . This defect would cause the missiles to fall short of their targets if launched over the North Pole as planned. The decision was made to station the missiles at Malmstrom AFB in Montana instead. These changes would allow the missiles, even with their defective boosters, to reach their intended targets in the case of a launch.

The &quot;improved&quot; LGM-30B Minuteman I became operational at Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota, Minot AFB, North Dakota, F.E. Warren AFB, Wyoming, and Whiteman AFB, Missouri, in 1963 and 1964. All 800 Minuteman I missiles were delivered by June 1965. Each of the bases had 150 missiles emplaced; F.E. Warren had 200 of the Minuteman IB missiles. Malmstrom had 150 of the Minuteman I, and about five years later added 50 of the Minuteman II similar to those installed at Grand Forks AFB, ND.

==== Specifications ====
The Minuteman I&#x27;s length varied based on which variation one was to look at. The Minuteman I/A had a length of and the Minuteman I/B had a length of . The Minuteman I weighed roughly , had an operational range of with an accuracy of about .

==== Guidance ====
The Minuteman I Autonetics D-17 flight computer used a rotating air bearing magnetic disk holding 2,560 &quot;cold-stored&quot; words in 20 tracks (write heads disabled after program fill) of 24 bits each and one alterable track of 128 words. The time for a D-17 disk revolution was 10 ms. The D-17 also used a number of short loops for faster access to intermediate results storage. The D-17 computational minor cycle was three disk revolutions or 30 ms. During that time all recurring computations were performed. For ground operations, the inertial platform was aligned and gyro correction rates updated.

During a flight, filtered command outputs were sent by each minor cycle to the engine nozzles. Unlike modern computers, which use descendants of that technology for secondary storage on hard disk, the disk was the active computer memory. The disk storage was considered hardened to radiation from nearby nuclear explosions, making it an ideal storage medium. To improve computational speed, the D-17 borrowed an instruction look-ahead feature from the Autonetics-built Field Artillery Data Computer (M18 FADAC) that permitted simple instruction execution every word time.

==== Warhead ====
At its introduction into service in 1962, Minuteman I was fitted with the W59 warhead with a yield of 1 Mt. Production for the W56 warhead with a 1.2 Mt yield began in March 1963 and W59 production was ended in July 1963 with a production run of only 150 warheads before being retired in June 1969. The W56 would continue production until May 1969 with a production run of 1000 warheads. Mods 0 to 3 were retired by September 1966 and the Mod 4 version would remain in service until the 1990s.

It&#x27;s not clear exactly why the W59 was replaced by the W56 after deployment but issues with &quot;... one-point safety&quot; and &quot;performance under aged conditions&quot; were cited in a 1987 congressional report regarding the warhead. Chuck Hansen alleged that all weapons sharing the &quot;Tsetse&quot; nuclear primary design including the W59 suffered from a critical one-point safety issue and suffered premature tritium aging issues that needed to be corrected after entry into service.

=== Minuteman II (LGM-30F) ===
:&quot;See also W56 warhead&quot;
The LGM-30F Minuteman II was an improved version of the Minuteman I missile. Its first test launch took place on September 24, 1964. Development on the Minuteman II began in 1962 as the Minuteman I entered the Strategic Air Command&#x27;s nuclear force. Minuteman II production and deployment began in 1965 and completed in 1967. It had an increased range, greater throw weight and guidance system with better azimuthal coverage, providing military planners with better accuracy and a wider range of targets. Some missiles also carried penetration aids, allowing the higher probability of kill against Moscow&#x27;s anti-ballistic missile system. The payload consisted of a single Mk-11C reentry vehicle containing a W56 nuclear warhead with a yield of 1.2 megatons of TNT (5 PJ).

==== Specifications ====
The Minuteman II had a length of , weighed roughly , had an operational range of with an accuracy of about .

The major new features provided by Minuteman II were:

* An improved first-stage motor to increase reliability.
* A novel, single, fixed nozzle with liquid injection thrust vector control on a larger second-stage motor to increase missile range. Additional motor improvements to increase reliability.
* An improved guidance system (the D-37 flight computer), incorporating microchips and miniaturized discrete electronic parts. Minuteman II was the first program to make a major commitment to these new devices. Their use made possible multiple target selection, greater accuracy and reliability, a reduction in the overall size and weight of the guidance system, and an increase in the survivability of the guidance system in a nuclear environment. The guidance system contained 2,000 microchips made by Texas Instruments.
* A penetration aids system to camouflage the warhead during its reentry into an enemy environment. In addition, the Mk-11C reentry vehicle incorporated stealth features to reduce its radar signature and make it more difficult to distinguish from decoys. The Mk-11C was no longer made of titanium for this and other reasons.
* A larger warhead in the reentry vehicle to increase kill probability.

System modernization was concentrated on launch facilities and command and control facilities. This provided decreased reaction time and increased survivability when under nuclear attack. Final changes to the system were performed to increase compatibility with the expected LGM-118A Peacekeeper. These newer missiles were later deployed into modified Minuteman silos.

The Minuteman II program was the first mass-produced system to use a computer constructed from integrated circuits (the Autonetics D-37C). The Minuteman II integrated circuits were diode–transistor logic and diode logic made by Texas Instruments. The other major customer of early integrated circuits was the Apollo Guidance Computer, which had similar weight and ruggedness constraints. The Apollo integrated circuits were resistor–transistor logic made by Fairchild Semiconductor. The Minuteman II flight computer continued to use rotating magnetic disks for primary storage. The Minuteman II included diodes by Microsemi Corporation.

=== Minuteman III (LGM-30G) ===

:&quot;See also W62 warhead&quot;
The LGM-30G Minuteman III program started in 1966 and included several improvements over the previous versions. Its first test launch took place on August 16, 1968. It was first deployed in 1970. Most modifications related to the final stage and reentry system (RS). The final (third) stage was improved with a new fluid-injected motor, giving finer control than the previous four-nozzle system.
Performance improvements realized in Minuteman III include increased flexibility in reentry vehicle (RV) and penetration aids deployment, increased survivability after a nuclear attack, and increased payload capacity. The missile retains a gimballed inertial navigation system.

Minuteman III originally contained the following distinguishing features:

* Armed with up to three W62 Mk-12 warheads, having a yield of only 170 kilotons TNT, instead of previous W56&#x27;s yield of 1.2 megatons.
* It was the first missile equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV). A single missile was then able to target three separate locations. This was an improvement from the Minuteman I and Minuteman II models, which were able to carry only one large warhead.
** An RS capable of deploying, in addition to the warheads, penetration aids such as chaff and decoys.
** Minuteman III introduced in the post-boost-stage (&quot;bus&quot;) an additional liquid-fuel propulsion system rocket engine (PSRE) that is used to slightly adjust the trajectory. This enables it to dispense decoys or – with MIRV – dispense individual RVs to separate targets. For the PSRE it uses the bipropellant Rocketdyne RS-14 engine.
* The Hercules M57 third stage of Minuteman I and Minuteman II had thrust termination ports on the sides. These ports, when opened by detonation of shaped charges, reduced the chamber pressure so abruptly that the interior flame was blown out. This allowed a precisely timed termination of thrust for targeting accuracy. The larger Minuteman III third-stage motor also has thrust termination ports although the final velocity is determined by PSRE.
* A fixed nozzle with a liquid injection thrust vector control system on the new third-stage motor (similar to the second-stage Minuteman II nozzle) additionally increased range.
* A flight computer (Autonetics D37D) with larger disk memory and enhanced capability.
** A Honeywell HDC-701 flight computer which employed non-destructive readout plated-wire memory instead of rotating magnetic disk for primary storage was developed as a backup for the D37D but was never adopted.
** The Guidance Replacement Program, initiated in 1993, replaced the disk-based D37D flight computer with a new one that uses radiation-resistant semiconductor RAM.

The Minuteman III missiles use D-37D computers and complete the 1,000 missile deployment of this system. The initial cost of these computers range from about $139,000 (D-37C) to $250,000 (D-17B).

The existing Minuteman III missiles have been further improved over the decades in service, with more than $7 billion spent in the 2010s to upgrade the 450 missiles.

==== Specifications ====
The Minuteman III has a length of , weighs , an operational range of , and an accuracy of about .

==== W78 warhead ====
In December 1979 the higher-yield W78 warhead (335–350 kilotons) began replacing a number of the W62s deployed on the Minuteman IIIs. These were delivered in the Mark 12A reentry vehicle. A small, unknown number of the previous Mark 12 RVs were retained operationally, however, to maintain a capability to attack more-distant targets in the south-central Asian republics of the USSR (the Mark 12 RV weighed slightly less than the Mark 12A).

==== Guidance Replacement Program ====
The Guidance Replacement Program replaces the NS20A Missile Guidance Set with the NS50 Missile Guidance Set. The newer system extends the service life of the Minuteman missile beyond the year 2030 by replacing aging parts and assemblies with current, high reliability technology while maintaining the current accuracy performance. The replacement program was completed 25 February 2008.

==== Propulsion Replacement Program ====
Beginning in 1998 and continuing through 2009, the Propulsion Replacement Program extends the life and maintains the performance by replacing the old solid propellant boosters (downstages).

==== Single Reentry Vehicle ====
The Single Reentry Vehicle modification enabled the United States ICBM force to abide by the now-voided START II treaty requirements by reconfiguring Minuteman III missiles from three reentry vehicles down to one. Though it was eventually ratified by both parties, START II never entered into force and was essentially superseded by follow-on agreements such as SORT and New START, which do not limit MIRV capability. Minuteman III remains fitted with a single warhead due to the warhead limitations in New START.

==== Safety Enhanced Reentry Vehicle ====
Beginning in 2005, Mk-21/W87 RVs from the deactivated Peacekeeper missile were replaced on the Minuteman III force under the Safety Enhanced Reentry Vehicle (SERV) program. The older W78 did not have many of the safety features of the newer W87, such as insensitive high explosives, as well as more advanced safety devices. In addition to implementing these safety features in at least a portion of the future Minuteman III force, the decision to transfer W87s onto the missile was based on two features that improved the targeting capabilities of the weapon: more fuzing options which allowed for greater targeting flexibility, and the most accurate reentry vehicle available, which provided a greater probability of damage to the designated targets.

==== Deployment ====
The Minuteman III missile entered service in 1970, with weapon systems upgrades included during the production run from 1970 to 1978 to increase accuracy and payload capacity. , the USAF plans to operate it until the mid-2030s.

The LGM-118A Peacekeeper (MX) ICBM, which was to have replaced the Minuteman, was retired in 2005 as part of START II.

A total of 450 LGM-30G missiles are emplaced at F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming (90th Missile Wing), Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota (91st Missile Wing), and Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana (341st Missile Wing). All Minuteman I and Minuteman II missiles have been retired. The United States prefers to keep its MIRV deterrents on submarine-launched Trident Nuclear Missiles In 2014, the Air Force decided to put fifty Minuteman III silos into &quot;warm&quot; unarmed status, taking up half of the 100 slots in America&#x27;s allowable nuclear reserve. These can be reloaded in the future if necessary.

==== Testing ====

Minuteman III missiles are regularly tested with launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base in order to validate the effectiveness, readiness, and accuracy of the weapon system, as well as to support the system&#x27;s primary purpose, nuclear deterrence. The safety features installed on the Minuteman III for each test launch allow the flight controllers to terminate the flight at any time if the systems indicate that its course may take it unsafely over inhabited areas. Since these flights are for test purposes only, even terminated flights can send back valuable information to correct a potential problem with the system.

The test of an unarmed Minuteman III failed on November 1, 2023, from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. The U.S. Air Force said it had blown up the missile over the Pacific Ocean after an anomaly was detected following its launch.

The 576th Flight Test Squadron is responsible for planning, preparing, conducting, and assessing all ICBM ground and flight tests.

==Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS)==
The Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) is an integral part of the Minuteman ICBM command and control system and provides a survivable launch capability for the Minuteman ICBM force if ground-based launch control centers (LCCs) are destroyed.

When the Minuteman ICBM was first placed on alert, the Soviet Union did not have the number of weapons, accuracy, nor significant nuclear yield to completely destroy the Minuteman ICBM force during an attack. However, starting in the mid-1960s, the Soviets began to gain parity with the US and potentially had the capability to target and successfully attack the Minuteman force with an increased number of ICBMs that had greater yields and accuracy than were previously available.

Studying the problem, SAC realized that in order to prevent the US from launching all 1,000 Minuteman ICBMs, the Soviets did not have to target all 1,000 Minuteman missile silos. The Soviets needed to launch only a disarming decapitation strike against the 100 Minuteman LCCs – the command and control sites – in order to prevent the launch of all Minuteman ICBMs. Even though the Minuteman ICBMs would have been left unscathed in their missile silos following an LCC decapitation strike, the Minuteman missiles could not be launched without a command and control capability.

In other words, the Soviets needed only 100 warheads to eliminate command and control of the Minuteman ICBMs. Even if the Soviets chose to expend two to three warheads per LCC for assured damage expectancy, the Soviets would have had to expend only up to 300 warheads to disable the Minuteman ICBM force – far less than the total number of Minuteman silos. The Soviets could have then used the remaining warheads to strike other targets they chose.

Faced with only a few Minuteman LCC targets, the Soviets could have concluded that the odds of being successful in a Minuteman LCC decapitation strike were higher with less risk than it would have been having to face the almost insurmountable task of successfully attacking and destroying 1000 Minuteman silos and 100 Minuteman LCCs to ensure Minuteman was disabled. This theory motivated SAC to design a survivable means to launch Minuteman, even if all the ground-based command and control sites were destroyed.

After thorough testing and modification of EC-135 command post aircraft, the ALCS demonstrated its capability on 17 April 1967 by launching an ERCS configured Minuteman II out of Vandenberg AFB, CA. Afterward, ALCS achieved Initial Operational Capability on 31 May 1967. From that point on, airborne missileers stood alert with ALCS-capable EC-135 aircraft for several decades. All Minuteman ICBM Launch Facilities were modified and built to have the capability to receive commands from ALCS. With ALCS standing alert around-the-clock, the Soviets could no longer successfully launch a Minuteman LCC decapitation strike. Even if the Soviets attempted to do so, EC-135s equipped with the ALCS could fly overhead and launch the remaining Minuteman ICBMs in retaliation.

With the ALCS on alert, the Soviet war planning was complicated by forcing them to target not only the 100 LCCs, but also the 1,000 silos with more than one warhead in order to guarantee destruction. This would have required upwards of 3,000 warheads to complete such an attack. The odds of being successful in such an attack on the Minuteman ICBM force would have been extremely low.

The ALCS is operated by airborne missileers from the Air Force Global Strike Command&#x27;s (AFGSC) 625th Strategic Operations Squadron (STOS) and United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM). The weapon system is also located on board the United States Navy&#x27;s E-6B Mercury. The ALCS crews are integrated into the battle staff of the USSTRATCOM &quot;Looking Glass&quot; Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) and are on alert around-the-clock. Although the Minuteman ICBM force has been reduced since the end of the Cold War, the ALCS continues to act as a force multiplier by ensuring that some enemy cannot launch a successful Minuteman LCC decapitation strike.

== Other roles ==

===Mobile Minuteman===
Mobile Minuteman was a program for rail-based ICBMs to help increase survivability and for which the USAF released details on 12 October 1959. Minuteman Mobility Test Trains were first exercised from 20 June to 27 August 1960 at Hill Air Force Base, and the 4062nd Strategic Missile Wing (Mobile) was organized 1 December 1960. It was planned to include three missile train squadrons, each with 10 trains carrying 3 missiles per train. During the Kennedy/McNamara force reductions, the Department of Defense announced &quot;that it has abandoned the plan for a mobile Minuteman ICBM. The concept called for 600 to be placed in service450 in silos and 150 on special trains, each train carrying 5 missiles.&quot; Kennedy announced on 18 March 1961 that the 3 squadrons were to be replaced with &quot;fixed-base squadrons&quot;, and Strategic Air Command discontinued the 4062nd Strategic Missile Wing on 20 February 1962.

===Air-Launched ICBM===

Air-Launched ICBM was a STRAT-X proposal in which SAMSO (Space &amp; Missile Systems Organization) successfully conducted an Air Mobile Feasibility Test that airdropped a Minuteman 1b from a C-5A Galaxy aircraft from over the Pacific Ocean. The missile fired at , and the 10-second engine burn carried the missile to 20,000 feet again before it dropped into the ocean. Operational deployment was discarded due to engineering and security difficulties, and the capability was a negotiating point in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks.

=== Emergency Rocket Communications System (ERCS) ===

From 1963 through 1991, the National Command Authority communication relay system included the Emergency Rocket Communication System (ERCS). Specially designed rockets called BLUE SCOUT carried radio-transmitting payloads high above the continental United States, to relay messages to units within line-of-sight. In the event of a nuclear attack, ERCS payloads would relay pre-programmed messages giving the &quot;go-order&quot; to SAC units.

BLUE SCOUT launch sites were located at Wisner, West Point and Tekamah, Nebraska. These locations were vital for ERCS effectiveness due to their centralized position in the US, within range of all missile complexes. In 1968, ERCS configurations were placed on the top of modified Minuteman II ICBMs (LGM-30Fs) under the control of the 510th Strategic Missile Squadron located at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri.

The Minuteman ERCS may have been assigned the designation LEM-70A.

=== Satellite launching role ===
The U.S. Air Force has considered using some decommissioned Minuteman missiles in a satellite launching role. These missiles would be stored in silos, for launch upon short notice. The payload would be variable and would have the ability to be replaced quickly. This would allow a surge capability in times of emergency.

During the 1980s, surplus Minuteman missiles were used to power the Conestoga rocket produced by Space Services Inc. of America. It was the first privately funded rocket, but saw only three flights and was discontinued due to a lack of business. More recently, converted Minuteman missiles have been used to power the Minotaur line of rockets produced by Orbital Sciences (nowadays Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems).

=== Ground and air launch targets ===
L-3 Communications is currently using SR-19 SRBs, Minuteman II Second Stage Solid Rocket Boosters, as delivery vehicles for a range of different re-entry vehicles as targets for the THAAD and ASIP interceptor missile programs as well as radar testing.

== Operators ==
The United States Air Force has been the only operator of the Minuteman ICBM weapons system, currently with three operational wings and one test squadron operating the LGM-30G. The active inventory in FY 2009 is 450 missiles and 45 Missile Alert Facilities (MAF).

===Operational units===
The basic tactical unit of a Minuteman wing is the squadron, consisting of five flights. Each flight consists of ten unmanned launch facilities (LFs) which are remotely controlled by a manned launch control center (LCC). A two-officer crew is on duty in the LCC, typically for 24 hours. The five flights are interconnected and status from any LF may be monitored by any of the five LCCs. Each LF is located at least three nautical miles (5.6 km) from any LCC.

Control does not extend outside the squadron (thus the 319th Missile Squadron&#x27;s five LCCs cannot control the 320th Missile Squadron&#x27;s 50 LFs even though they are part of the same Missile Wing). Each Minuteman wing is assisted logistically by a nearby Missile Support Base (MSB). If the ground-based LCCs are destroyed or incapacitated, the Minuteman ICBMs can be launched by airborne missileers utilizing the Airborne Launch Control System.

== Replacement ==
A request for proposal for development and maintenance of a Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) next-generation nuclear ICBM, was made by the US Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, ICBM Systems Directorate, GBSD Division on 29 July 2016. The GBSD would replace MMIII in the land-based portion of the US Nuclear Triad. The new missile to be phased in over a decade from the late 2020s are estimated over a fifty-year life cycle to cost around $86 billion. Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman were competing for the contract.

On 21 August 2017, the US Air Force awarded 3-year development contracts to Boeing and Northrop Grumman, for $349 million and $329 million, respectively. One of these companies will be selected to produce this ground-based nuclear ICBM in 2020. In 2027, the GBSD program is expected to enter service and remain active until 2075.

On 14 December 2019, it was announced that Northrop Grumman had won the competition to build the future ICBM. Northrop won by default, as their bid was at the time the only bid left to be considered for the GBSD program (Boeing had dropped out of the bidding contest earlier in 2019). The US Air Force stated that it would &quot;proceed with an aggressive and effective sole-source negotiation.&quot;

== Surviving decommissioned sites ==

<text>Laurent-Désiré Kabila (; 27 November 1939 – 16 January 2001) usually known as Laurent Kabila ( ), was a Congolese rebel and politician who served as the third president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 1997 until his assassination in 2001.

Kabila initially gained prominence as an opponent of Mobutu Sese Seko during the Congo Crisis (1960–1965). He took part in the Simba rebellion and led the Communist-aligned Fizi rebel breakaway state in eastern Congo from 1967 to 1988 before dissappearing from public. In the 1990s, Kabila re-emerged as leader of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (ADFLC), a Rwandan and Ugandan-sponsored rebel group that invaded Zaire and overthrew Mobutu during the First Congo War from 1996 to 1997. Following the war, Kabila became the new president of the country, whose name was changed back to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The following year, he ordered all foreign troops to leave the country following the Kasika massacre to prevent a potential coup, leading to the Second Congo War (1998–2003), in which his former Rwandan and Ugandan allies supported several rebel groups to overthrow him. In 2001, he was assassinated by one of his bodyguards, and was succeeded by his 29-year-old son Joseph.

== Early life ==
Kabila was born to the Luba people in Baudouinville, Katanga Province, (now Moba, Tanganyika Province), or Jadotville, Katanga Province, (now Likasi, Haut-Katanga Province) in the Belgian Congo. His father was a Luba and his mother was a Lunda; his father&#x27;s ethnicity was defining in the patriarchal kinship system. It is claimed that he studied abroad (political philosophy in Paris, got a PhD in Tashkent, in Belgrade and at last in Dar es Salaam), but no proof has been found or provided.

== Political activities ==
=== 1960s Congo Crisis ===

Shortly after the Congo achieved independence in 1960, Katanga seceded under the leadership of Moïse Tshombe. Kabila organised the Baluba in an anti-secessionist rebellion in Manono. In September 1962 a new province, North Katanga, was established. He became a member of the provincial assembly and served as chief of cabinet for Minister of Information Ferdinand Tumba. In September 1963 he and other young members of the assembly were forced to resign, facing allegations of communist sympathies.

Kabila established himself as a supporter of hard-line Lumumbist Prosper Mwamba Ilunga. When the Lumumbists formed the Conseil National de Libération, he was sent to eastern Congo to help organize a revolution, in particular in the Kivu and North Katanga provinces. This revolution was part of the larger Simba rebellions happening in the provinces at the time. In 1965, Kabila set up a cross-border rebel operation from Kigoma, Tanzania, across Lake Tanganyika.

=== Association with Che Guevara ===
Kabila met Che Guevara for the first time in late April 1965 where Guevara had appeared in the Congo with approximately 100 Cuban men who envisaged to bring about a Cuban-style revolution to overthrow the Congolese government. Guevara assisted Kabila and his rebel forces for a few months before Guevara judged Kabila (then age 26) as &quot;not the man of the hour&quot; he had alluded to, being too distracted and his men poorly trained and disciplined. This, in Guevara&#x27;s opinion, accounted for Kabila showing up days late at times to provide supplies, aid, or backup to Guevara&#x27;s men. Kabila preferred to spend most of his time at local bars or brothels instead of training his men or fighting the Congolese government forces. The lack of cooperation between Kabila and Guevara contributed to the suppression of the revolt in November that same year.

In Guevara&#x27;s view, of all of the people he met during his campaign in Congo, only Kabila had &quot;genuine qualities of a mass leader&quot;; but Guevara castigated Kabila for a lack of &quot;revolutionary seriousness&quot;. After the failure of the rebellion, Kabila turned to smuggling gold and timber on Lake Tanganyika. He also ran a bar and brothel in Kigoma, Tanzania.

=== Marxist mini-state (1967–1988) ===

In 1967, Kabila and his remnant of supporters moved their operation into the mountainous Fizi – Baraka area of South Kivu in the Congo, and founded the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (PRP). With the support of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the PRP created a secessionist Marxist state in South Kivu province, west of Lake Tanganyika.

The PRP state came to an end in 1988 and Kabila disappeared and was widely believed to be dead. While in Kampala, Kabila reportedly met Yoweri Museveni, the future president of Uganda. Museveni and former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere later introduced Kabila to Paul Kagame, who would become president of Rwanda. These personal contacts became vital in mid-1990s, when Uganda and Rwanda sought a Congolese face for their intervention in Zaire.

== First Congo War ==

As Rwandan Hutu refugees fled to Congo (then Zaire) after the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, refugee camps along the Zaire-Rwanda border became militarized with Hutu militia vowing to retake power in Rwanda. The Kigali regime considered these militias as a security threat and was seeking a way to dismantle those refugee camps. After Kigali had expressed its security concerns to Kinshasa, requesting that refugee camps get moved further inside the country, and Kinshasa ignored these concerns, Kigali believed that only military option could solve the issue. However, a military operation inside Zaire was likely be seen by the international community as an invasion. A plan was put in place to foment a rebellion that would serve as a cover. The Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL) was then born with Rwanda&#x27;s blessing, and with Kabila as its spokesperson.

By mid-1997, the AFDL had almost completely overrun the country and the remains of Mobutu&#x27;s army. Only the country&#x27;s decrepit infrastructure slowed Kabila&#x27;s forces down; in many areas, the only means of transit were irregularly used dirt paths. Following failed peace talks held on board of the South African ship SAS &quot;Outeniqua&quot;, Mobutu fled into exile on 16 May.

The next day, from his base in Lubumbashi, Kabila declared victory and installed himself as president. Kabila suspended the Constitution and changed the name of the country from Zaire to the Democratic Republic of the Congo—the country&#x27;s official name from 1964 to 1971. He made his grand entrance into Kinshasa on 20 May and was sworn in on 31 May, officially commencing his tenure as president.

== Presidency (1997–2001) ==
Kabila had previously been a committed Marxist, but his policies at this point were social democratic. He declared that elections would not be held for two years, since it would take him at least that long to restore order. While some in the West hailed Kabila as representing a &quot;new breed&quot; of African leadership, critics charged that Kabila&#x27;s policies differed little from his predecessor&#x27;s, being characterised by authoritarianism, corruption, and human rights abuses. As early as late 1997, Kabila was being denounced as &quot;another Mobutu&quot;. Kabila was also accused trying to set up a personality cult. Mobutu&#x27;s former minister of information, Dominique Sakombi Inongo, was retained by Kabila; he branded Kabila as &quot;the Mzee,&quot; and created posters reading &quot;Here is the man we needed&quot; () appeared all over the country.
By 1998, Kabila&#x27;s former allies in Uganda and Rwanda had turned against him and backed a new rebellion of the Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD) and the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC). Kabila found new allies in Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe, and managed to hold on in the south and west of the country and by July 1999, peace talks led to the withdrawal of most foreign forces.

==Assassination and trial==

On 16 January 2001, Kabila was shot in his office at the Palais de Marbre and subsequently transported to Zimbabwe for medical treatment. The DRC&#x27;s authorities managed to keep power, despite Kabila&#x27;s assassination. The exact circumstances are still contested. Kabila reportedly died on the spot, according to DRC&#x27;s then-health minister Leonard Mashako Mamba, who was in the next door office when Kabila was shot and arrived immediately after the assassination. The government claimed that Kabila was still alive, however, and he was flown to a hospital in Zimbabwe after he was shot so that DRC authorities could organize the succession.

The Congolese government announced that he had died of his wounds on 18 January. One week later, his body was returned to Congo for a state funeral and his son, Joseph Kabila, became president ten days later. By doing so, DRC officials were accomplishing the &quot;verbal testimony&quot; of the deceased President. Then Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo and Kabila&#x27;s aide-de-camp Eddy Kapend reported that Kabila had told them that his son Joseph, then number two of the army, should take over, if he were to die in office.

The investigation into Kabila&#x27;s assassination led to 135 people, including four children, being tried before a special military tribunal. The alleged ringleader, Colonel Eddy Kapend (one of Kabila&#x27;s cousins), and 25 others were sentenced to death in January 2003, but not executed. Of the remaining defendants, 64 were incarcerated, with sentences from six months to life, and 45 were exonerated. Some individuals were also accused of being involved in a plot to overthrow his son. Among them was Kabila&#x27;s special advisor Emmanuel Dungia, former ambassador to South Africa. Many people believe the trial was flawed and the convicted defendants innocent; doubts are summarized in an &quot;Al Jazeera&quot; investigative film, &quot;Murder in Kinshasa&quot;.

In January 2021, DRC&#x27;s President Félix Tshisekedi pardoned all those convicted in the murder of Laurent-Désiré Kabila in 2001. Colonel Eddy Kapend and his co-defendants, who have been incarcerated for 15 years, were released.

== Personal life ==
He had at least nine children with his wife Sifa Mahanya: Josephine, Cécile, Fifi, Selemani, twins Jaynet and Joseph, Zoé, Anina and Tetia. He was also the alleged father of Aimée Kabila Mulengela whose mother is Zaïna Kibangula.

The 1928 Games were the first true Winter Olympics to be held as a stand-alone event, not in conjunction with a Summer Olympics. The preceding 1924 Winter Games were retroactively renamed the inaugural Winter Olympics, although they had in fact been organised alongside the 1924 Summer Olympics in France. Before 1924, the winter events were included in the schedule of the Summer Games and there were no separate Winter Games. The 1928 Winter Games also replaced the now redundant Nordic Games, which had been held at varying intervals since early in the 20th century.

The hosts were challenged by fluctuating weather conditions; the opening ceremony was held in a blizzard, while warm weather conditions plagued sporting events throughout the rest of the Games. The 10,000 metre speed-skating event was controversially abandoned and officially cancelled. Filmed footage of the games exists in a silent, feature-length documentary, &quot;The White Stadium&quot;.

== Highlights ==

* Sonja Henie of Norway returned to the Winter Olympics, having taken part in 1924 at the age of 11, and made history by winning the ladies&#x27; figure skating aged 15. She became the youngest Olympic champion in history (a distinction she held for 70 years), and went on to defend her title at the next two Winter Olympics.
* Norway&#x27;s Ivar Ballangrud won the Olympic title in the 5,000-metre speed skating event, and Clas Thunberg of Finland won both the 500 m and the 1,500 m.
* Norway finished at the top of the medal table with a total of six gold medals, four silver, and five bronze, totalling 15 medals. The United States finished second in the table with six medals overall.
* Switzerland won a single bronze medal, the lowest medal haul by a host nation at any Olympic Games.
* American Irving Jaffee was leading the 10,000-metre speed skating race, having outskated Norwegian defending world champion Bernt Evensen in their heat, when rising temperatures thawed the ice. In a controversial ruling, the Norwegian referee cancelled the entire competition; the International Olympic Committee stepped in to reverse the referee&#x27;s decision and awarded Jaffee the gold medal, but the International Skating Union later overruled the IOC and restored the ruling. Evensen, for his part, stated publicly that Jaffee should be awarded the gold medal, but that did not happen.

<doc id="49370" wikidata="Q217619" url="?curid=49370" title="Anthony Burgess">
<text>John Anthony Burgess Wilson, (; 25 February 1917 – 22 November 1993) who published under the name Anthony Burgess, was an English writer and composer.

Although Burgess was primarily a comic writer, his dystopian satire &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; remains his best-known novel. In 1971, it was adapted into a controversial film by Stanley Kubrick, which Burgess said was chiefly responsible for the popularity of the book. Burgess produced numerous other novels, including the Enderby quartet, and &quot;Earthly Powers&quot;. He wrote librettos and screenplays, including the 1977 television mini-series &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;. He worked as a literary critic for several publications, including &quot;The Observer&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and wrote studies of classic writers, notably James Joyce. A versatile linguist, Burgess lectured in phonetics, and translated &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, and the opera &quot;Carmen&quot;, among others. Burgess was nominated and shortlisted for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1973.

Burgess also composed over 250 musical works; he considered himself as much a composer as an author, although he achieved considerably more success in writing.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
In 1917, Burgess was born at 91 Carisbrook Street in Harpurhey, a suburb of Manchester, England, to Catholic parents, Joseph and Elizabeth Wilson. He described his background as lower middle class; growing up during the Great Depression, his parents, who were shopkeepers, were fairly well off, as the demand for their tobacco and alcohol wares remained constant. He was known in childhood as Jack, Little Jack, and Johnny Eagle. At his confirmation, the name Anthony was added and he became John Anthony Burgess Wilson. He began using the pen name Anthony Burgess upon the publication of his 1956 novel &quot;Time for a Tiger&quot;.

His mother Elizabeth (&quot;née&quot; Burgess) died at the age of 30 at home on 19 November 1918, during the 1918 flu pandemic. The causes listed on her death certificate were influenza, acute pneumonia, and cardiac failure. His sister Muriel had died four days earlier on 15 November from influenza, broncho-pneumonia, and cardiac failure, aged eight. Burgess believed he was resented by his father, Joseph Wilson, for having survived, when his mother and sister did not.

After the death of his mother, Burgess was raised by his maternal aunt, Ann Bromley, in Crumpsall with her two daughters. During this time, Burgess&#x27;s father worked as a bookkeeper for a beef market by day, and in the evening played piano at a public house in Miles Platting. After his father married the landlady of this pub, Margaret Dwyer, in 1922, Burgess was raised by his father and stepmother. By 1924 the couple had established a tobacconist and off-licence business with four properties. Burgess was briefly employed at the tobacconist shop as a child. On 18 April 1938, Joseph Wilson died from cardiac failure, pleurisy, and influenza at the age of 55, leaving no inheritance despite his apparent business success. Burgess&#x27;s stepmother died of a heart attack in 1940.

Burgess has said of his largely solitary childhood &quot;I was either distractedly persecuted or ignored. I was one despised. ... Ragged boys in gangs would pounce on the well-dressed like myself.&quot; Burgess attended St. Edmund&#x27;s Elementary School, before moving on to Bishop Bilsborrow Memorial Elementary School, both Catholic schools, in Moss Side. He later reflected &quot;When I went to school I was able to read. At the Manchester elementary school I attended, most of the children could not read, so I was ... a little apart, rather different from the rest.&quot; Good grades resulted in a place at Xaverian College (1928–37).

==== Music ====
Burgess was indifferent to music until he heard on his home-built radio &quot;a quite incredible flute solo&quot;, which he characterised as &quot;sinuous, exotic, erotic&quot;, and became spellbound. Eight minutes later the announcer told him he had been listening to &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot; by Claude Debussy. He referred to this as a &quot;psychedelic moment ... a recognition of verbally inexpressible spiritual realities&quot;. When Burgess announced to his family that he wanted to be a composer, they objected as &quot;there was no money in it&quot;. Music was not taught at his school, but at the age of about 14 he taught himself to play the piano.

==== University ====
Burgess had originally hoped to study music at university, but the music department at the Victoria University of Manchester turned down his application because of poor grades in physics. Instead, he studied English language and literature there between 1937 and 1940, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts. His thesis concerned Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;, and he graduated with an upper second-class honours, which he found disappointing. When grading one of Burgess&#x27;s term papers, the historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote: &quot;Bright ideas insufficient to conceal lack of knowledge.&quot;

==== Marriage ====
Burgess met Llewela &quot;Lynne&quot; Isherwood Jones at the university where she was studying economics, politics and modern history, graduating in 1942 with an upper second-class. Burgess and Jones were married on 22 January 1942. She was the daughter of secondary school headmaster Edward Jones (1886–1963) and Florence (née Jones; 1867–1956), and reportedly claimed to be a distant relative of Christopher Isherwood, although the Lewis and Biswell biographies dispute this. According to Burgess&#x27;s own account, it was not from his wife that the alleged connection to Christopher Isherwood originated: &quot;Her father was an English Jones, her mother a Welsh one. [...] Of Christopher Isherwood [...] neither the Jones father or daughter had heard. She was unliterary ...&quot; Biswell identifies Burgess as the origin of the alleged relationship with Christopher Isherwood—&quot;if the rumour of an Isherwood affiliation signifies anything, it is that Burgess wanted people to believe that he was connected by marriage to another famous writer&quot;—and notes that &quot;Llewela was not, as Burgess claims in his autobiography, a &#x27;cousin&#x27; of the writer Christopher Isherwood&quot;; referring to a pedigree owned by the family, Biswell observes that &quot;Llewela&#x27;s father was descended from a female Isherwood&quot; ... &quot;which means going back four generations ... before encountering any Isherwoods&quot;, making any connection &quot;at best&quot; &quot;tenuous and distant&quot;. He also establishes that per official records, &quot;Llewela&#x27;s family name was Jones, not (as Burgess liked to suggest) &#x27;Isherwood Jones&#x27; or &#x27;Isherwood-Jones&#x27;.&quot;

=== Military service ===
Burgess spent six weeks in 1940 as a British Army recruit in Eskbank before becoming a Nursing Orderly Class 3 in the Royal Army Medical Corps. During his service, he was unpopular and was involved in incidents such as knocking off a corporal&#x27;s cap and polishing the floor of a corridor to make people slip. In 1941, Burgess was pursued by the Royal Military Police for desertion after overstaying his leave from Morpeth military base with his future bride Lynne. The following year he asked to be transferred to the Army Educational Corps and, despite his loathing of authority, he was promoted to sergeant. During the blackout, his pregnant wife Lynne was raped and assaulted by four American deserters; perhaps as a result, she lost the child. Burgess, stationed at the time in Gibraltar, was denied leave to see her.

At his stationing in Gibraltar, which he later wrote about in &quot;A Vision of Battlements&quot;, he worked as a training college lecturer in speech and drama, teaching alongside Ann McGlinn in German, French and Spanish. McGlinn&#x27;s communist ideology would have a major influence on his later novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. Burgess played a key role in &quot;The British Way and Purpose&quot; programme, designed to introduce members of the forces to the peacetime socialism of the post-war years in Britain. He was an instructor for the Central Advisory Council for Forces Education of the Ministry of Education. Burgess&#x27;s flair for languages was noticed by army intelligence, and he took part in debriefings of Dutch expatriates and Free French who found refuge in Gibraltar during the war. In the neighbouring Spanish town of La Línea de la Concepción, he was arrested for insulting General Franco but released from custody shortly after the incident.

=== Early teaching career ===
Burgess left the army in 1946 with the rank of sergeant-major. For the next four years he was a lecturer in speech and drama at the Mid-West School of Education near Wolverhampton and at the Bamber Bridge Emergency Teacher Training College near Preston. Burgess taught in the extramural department of Birmingham University (1946–50).

In late 1950, he began working as a secondary school teacher at Banbury Grammar School (now Banbury School) teaching English literature. In addition to his teaching duties, he supervised sports and ran the school&#x27;s drama society. He organised a number of amateur theatrical events in his spare time. These involved local people and students and included productions of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Sweeney Agonistes&quot;. Reports from his former students and colleagues indicate that he cared deeply about teaching.

With financial assistance provided by Lynne&#x27;s father, the couple was able to put a down payment on a cottage in the village of Adderbury, close to Banbury. He named the cottage &quot;Little Gidding&quot; after one of Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Four Quartets&quot;. Burgess cut his journalistic teeth in Adderbury, writing several articles for the local newspaper, the &quot;Banbury Guardian&quot;.

=== Malaya ===

In 1954, Burgess joined the British Colonial Service as a teacher and education officer in Malaya, initially stationed at Kuala Kangsar in Perak. Here he taught at the &quot;Malay College&quot; (now Malay College Kuala Kangsar – MCKK), modelled on English public school lines. In addition to his teaching duties, he was a housemaster in charge of students of the preparatory school, who were housed at a Victorian mansion known as &quot;King&#x27;s Pavilion&quot;. A variety of the music he wrote there was influenced by the country, notably Sinfoni Melayu for orchestra and brass band, which included cries of Merdeka (independence) from the audience. No score, however, is extant.

Burgess and his wife had occupied a noisy apartment where privacy was minimal, and this caused resentment. Following a dispute with the Malay College&#x27;s principal about this, Burgess was reposted to the Malay Teachers&#x27; Training College at Kota Bharu, Kelantan. Burgess attained fluency in Malay, spoken and written, achieving distinction in the examinations in the language set by the Colonial Office. He was rewarded with a salary increase for his proficiency in the language.

He devoted some of his free time in Malaya to creative writing &quot;as a sort of gentlemanly hobby, because I knew there wasn&#x27;t any money in it,&quot; and published his first novels: &quot;Time for a Tiger&quot;, &quot;The Enemy in the Blanket&quot; and &quot;Beds in the East&quot;. These became known as &quot;The Malayan Trilogy&quot; and were later published in one volume as &quot;The Long Day Wanes&quot;.

=== Brunei ===

After a brief period of leave in Britain during 1958, Burgess took up a further Eastern post, this time at the Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien College in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei. Brunei had been a British protectorate since 1888, and was not to achieve independence until 1984. In the sultanate, Burgess sketched the novel that, when it was published in 1961, was to be entitled &quot;Devil of a State&quot; and, although it dealt with Brunei, to avoid libel the action had to be transposed to an imaginary East African territory similar to Zanzibar, named Dunia. In his autobiography &quot;Little Wilson and Big God&quot; (1987), Burgess wrote:
About this time, Burgess collapsed in a Brunei classroom while teaching history and was diagnosed as having an inoperable brain tumour. Burgess was given just a year to live, prompting him to write several novels to get money to provide for his widow. He gave a different account, however, to Jeremy Isaacs in a &quot;Face to Face&quot; interview on the BBC &quot;The Late Show&quot; (21 March 1989). He said &quot;Looking back now I see that I was driven out of the Colonial Service. I think possibly for political reasons that were disguised as clinical reasons&quot;. He alluded to this in an interview with Don Swaim, explaining that his wife Lynne had said something &quot;obscene&quot; to the Duke of Edinburgh during an official visit, and the colonial authorities turned against him. He had already earned their displeasure, he told Swaim, by writing articles in the newspaper in support of the revolutionary opposition party the Parti Rakyat Brunei, and for his friendship with its leader Dr. Azahari. Burgess&#x27;s biographers attribute the incident to the author&#x27;s notorious mythomania. Geoffrey Grigson writes:
=== Repatriate years ===
Burgess was invalided home in 1959 and relieved of his position in Brunei. He spent some time in the neurological ward of a London hospital (see &quot;The Doctor is Sick&quot;) where he underwent cerebral tests that found no illness. On discharge, benefiting from a sum of money which Lynne Burgess had inherited from her father, together with their savings built up over six years in the East, he decided to become a full-time writer. The couple lived first in an apartment in Hove, near Brighton. They later moved to a semi-detached house called &quot;Applegarth&quot; in Etchingham, about four miles from Bateman&#x27;s where Rudyard Kipling had lived in Burwash, and one mile from the Robertsbridge home of Malcolm Muggeridge. Upon the death of Burgess&#x27;s father-in-law, the couple used their inheritance to decamp to a terraced town house in Chiswick. This provided convenient access to the BBC Television Centre where he later became a frequent guest. During these years Burgess became a regular drinking partner of the novelist William S. Burroughs. Their meetings took place in London and Tangiers.

A sea voyage the couple took with the Baltic Line from Tilbury to Leningrad in June 1961 resulted in the novel &quot;Honey for the Bears&quot;. He wrote in his autobiographical &quot;You&#x27;ve Had Your Time&quot; (1990), that in re-learning Russian at this time, he found inspiration for the Russian-based slang Nadsat that he created for &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, going on to note, &quot;I would resist to the limit any publisher&#x27;s demand that a glossary be provided.&quot;

Liana Macellari, an Italian translator twelve years younger than Burgess, came across his novels &quot;Inside Mr. Enderby&quot; and &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, while writing about English fiction. The two first met in 1963 over lunch in Chiswick and began an affair. In 1964, Liana gave birth to Burgess&#x27;s son, Paolo Andrea. The affair was hidden from Burgess&#x27;s alcoholic wife, whom he refused to leave for fear of offending his cousin (by Burgess&#x27;s stepmother, Margaret Dwyer Wilson), George Dwyer, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Leeds.

Lynne Burgess died from cirrhosis of the liver, on 20 March 1968. Six months later, in September 1968, Burgess married Liana, acknowledging her four-year-old boy as his own, although the birth certificate listed Roy Halliday, Liana&#x27;s former partner, as the father. Paolo Andrea (also known as Andrew Burgess Wilson) died in London in 2002, aged 37. Liana died in 2007.

=== Tax exile ===
Burgess was a Conservative (though, as he clarified in an interview with &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, his political views could be considered &quot;a kind of anarchism&quot; since his ideal of a &quot;Catholic Jacobite imperial monarch&quot; was not practicable) a (lapsed) Catholic and monarchist, harbouring a distaste for all republics. He believed socialism for the most part was &quot;ridiculous&quot; but did &quot;concede that socialised medicine is a priority in any civilised country today&quot;. To avoid the 90% tax the family would have incurred because of their high income, they left Britain and toured Europe in a Bedford Dormobile motor-home. During their travels through France and across the Alps, Burgess wrote in the back of the van as Liana drove.

In this period, he wrote novels and produced film scripts for Lew Grade and Franco Zeffirelli. His first place of residence after leaving England was Lija, Malta (1968–70). The negative reaction from a lecture that Burgess delivered to an audience of Catholic priests in Malta precipitated a move by the couple to Italy after the Maltese government confiscated the property. (He would go on to fictionalise these events in &quot;Earthly Powers&quot; a decade later.) The Burgesses maintained a flat in Rome, a country house in Bracciano, and a property in Montalbuccio. On hearing rumours of a mafia plot to kidnap Paolo Andrea while the family was staying in Rome, Burgess decided to move to Monaco in 1975. Burgess was also motivated to move to the tax haven of Monaco, as the country did not levy income tax, and widows were exempt from death duties, a form of taxation on their husband&#x27;s estates. The couple also had a villa in France, at Callian, Var, Provence.

Burgess lived for a number of years in the United States, working as writer-in-residence at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1969, as a visiting professor at Princeton University with the creative writing program in 1970, and as a distinguished professor at the City College of New York in 1972. At City College he was a close colleague and friend of Joseph Heller. He went on to teach creative writing at Columbia University, lectured on the novel at the University of Iowa in 1975, and was and at the University at Buffalo in 1976. Eventually he settled in Monaco in 1976, where he was active in the local community, becoming a co-founder of the Princess Grace Irish Library, a centre for Irish cultural studies, in 1984.

In May 1988, Burgess made an extended appearance with, among others, Andrea Dworkin on the episode &quot;What Is Sex For?&quot; of the discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot;. He spoke at one point about divorce:

Although Burgess lived not far from Graham Greene, whose house was in Antibes, Greene became aggrieved shortly before his death by comments in newspaper articles by Burgess and broke off all contact. Gore Vidal revealed in his 2006 memoir &quot;Point to Point Navigation&quot; that Greene disapproved of Burgess&#x27;s appearance on various European television stations to discuss his (Burgess&#x27;s) books. Vidal recounts that Greene apparently regarded a willingness to appear on television as something that ought to be beneath a writer&#x27;s dignity. &quot;He talks about his books,&quot; Vidal quotes an exasperated Greene as saying. During this time, Burgess spent much time at his chalet outside Lugano, Switzerland.

=== Death ===

Although Burgess wrote that he expected to &quot;die somewhere in the Mediterranean lands, with an inaccurate obituary in the &quot;Nice-Matin&quot;, unmourned, soon forgotten&quot;, he returned to die in Twickenham, an outer suburb of London, where he owned a house. Burgess died on 22 November 1993 from lung cancer, at the Hospital of St John &amp; St Elizabeth in London. His ashes were inurned at the Monaco Cemetery.

The epitaph on Burgess&#x27;s marble memorial stone, reads: &quot;Abba Abba&quot;, which means &quot;Father, father&quot; in Aramaic, Arabic, Hebrew, and other Semitic languages and is pronounced by Christ during his agony in Gethsemane () as he prays God to spare him. It is also the title of Burgess&#x27;s 22nd novel, concerning the death of John Keats. Eulogies at his memorial service at St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden, London, in 1994 were delivered by the journalist Auberon Waugh and the novelist William Boyd. &quot;The Times&quot; obituary heralded the author as &quot;a great moralist&quot;. His estate was worth US$3 million and included a large European property portfolio of houses and apartments.

== Writing ==
=== Novels ===

His Malayan trilogy &quot;The Long Day Wanes&quot; was Burgess&#x27;s first published fiction. Its three books are &quot;Time for a Tiger,&quot; &quot;The Enemy in the Blanket&quot; and &quot;Beds in the East.&quot; &quot;Devil of a State&quot; is a follow-on to the trilogy, set in a fictionalised version of Brunei. It was Burgess&#x27;s ambition to become &quot;the true fictional expert on Malaya&quot;. In these works, Burgess was working in the tradition established by Kipling for British India, and Conrad and Maugham for Southeast Asia. Burgess operated more in the mode of Orwell, who had a good command of Urdu and Burmese (necessary for Orwell&#x27;s work as a police officer) and Kipling, who spoke Hindi (having learnt it as a child). Like many of his fellow English expatriates in Asia, Burgess had excellent spoken and written command of his operative language(s), both as a novelist and as a speaker, including Malay.

Burgess&#x27;s repatriate years (–1969) produced &quot;Enderby&quot; and &quot;The Right to an Answer,&quot; which touches on the theme of death and dying, and &quot;One Hand Clapping,&quot; a satire on the vacuity of popular culture. &quot;The Worm and the Ring&quot; (1961) had to be withdrawn from circulation under the threat of libel action from one of Burgess&#x27;s former colleagues, a school secretary.

His dystopian novel, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, was published in 1962. It was inspired initially by an incident during the London Blitz of World War II in which his wife Lynne was robbed, assaulted, and violated by deserters from the US Army in London during the blackout. The event may have contributed to her subsequent miscarriage. The book was an examination of free will and morality. The young anti-hero, Alex, captured after a short career of violence and mayhem, undergoes a course of aversion therapy treatment to curb his violent tendencies. This results in making him defenceless against other people and unable to enjoy some of his favourite music that, besides violence, had been an intense pleasure for him. In the non-fiction book &quot;Flame into Being&quot; (1985), Burgess described &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; as &quot;a jeu d&#x27;esprit knocked off for money in three weeks. It became known as the raw material for a film which seemed to glorify sex and violence&quot;. He added, &quot;the film made it easy for readers of the book to misunderstand what it was about, and the misunderstanding will pursue me till I die&quot;. In a 1980 BBC interview, Burgess distanced himself from the novel and cinematic adaptations. Near the time of publication, the final chapter was cut from the American edition of the book.

Burgess had written &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; with 21 chapters, meaning to match the age of majority. &quot;21 is the symbol of human maturity, or used to be, since at 21 you got to vote and assumed adult responsibility&quot;, Burgess wrote in a foreword for a 1986 edition. Needing money and thinking that the publisher was &quot;being charitable in accepting the work at all,&quot; Burgess accepted the deal and allowed &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; to be published in the US with the twenty-first chapter omitted. Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; was based on the American edition, and thus helped to perpetuate the loss of the last chapter. In 2021, The International Anthony Burgess Foundation premiered a webpage cataloguing various stage productions of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; from around the world.

In Martin Seymour-Smith&#x27;s &quot;Novels and Novelists: A Guide to the World of Fiction,&quot; Burgess related that he would often prepare a synopsis with a name-list before beginning a project. Seymour-Smith wrote:
&quot;Nothing Like the Sun&quot; is a fictional recreation of Shakespeare&#x27;s love-life and an examination of the supposedly partly syphilitic sources of the bard&#x27;s imaginative vision. The novel, which drew on Edgar I. Fripp&#x27;s 1938 biography &quot;Shakespeare, Man and Artist&quot;, won critical acclaim and placed Burgess among the first rank novelists of his generation. &quot;M/F&quot; (1971) was listed by the writer himself as one of the works of which he was most proud. &quot;Beard&#x27;s Roman Women&quot; was revealing on a personal level, dealing with the death of his first wife, his bereavement, and the affair that led to his second marriage. In &quot;Napoleon Symphony&quot;, Burgess brought Bonaparte to life by shaping the novel&#x27;s structure to Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Eroica&quot; symphony. The novel contains a portrait of an Arab and Muslim society under occupation by a Christian western power (Egypt by Catholic France). In the 1980s, religious themes began to feature heavily (&quot;The Kingdom of the Wicked,&quot; &quot;Man of Nazareth,&quot; &quot;Earthly Powers&quot;). Though Burgess lapsed from Catholicism early in his youth, the influence of the Catholic &quot;training&quot; and worldview remained strong in his work all his life. This is notable in the discussion of free will in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, and in the apocalyptic vision of devastating changes in the Catholic Church – due to what can be understood as Satanic influence – in &quot;Earthly Powers&quot; (1980).

Burgess kept working through his final illness and was writing on his deathbed. The late novel &quot;Any Old Iron&quot; is a generational saga of two families, one Russian-Welsh, the other Jewish, encompassing the sinking of the Titanic, World War I, the Russian Revolution, the Spanish Civil War, World War II, the early years of the State of Israel, and the rediscovery of Excalibur. &quot;A Dead Man in Deptford&quot;, about Christopher Marlowe, is a companion novel to &quot;Nothing Like the Sun&quot;. The verse novel &quot;&quot; was published posthumously.

Burgess announced in a 1972 interview that he was writing a novel about the Black Prince which incorporated John Dos Passos&#x27;s narrative techniques, although he never finished writing it. After Burgess&#x27;s death, English writer Adam Roberts completed the novel, and it was published in 2018 under the title &quot;The Black Prince&quot;. In 2019, a previously unpublished analysis of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; was discovered titled, &quot;The Clockwork Condition&quot;. It is structured as Burgess&#x27;s philosophical musings on the novel that won him so much acclaim.

=== Critical studies ===
Burgess started his career as a critic. His &quot;English Literature, A Survey for Students&quot; was aimed at newcomers to the subject. He followed this with &quot;The Novel To-day&quot; (Longmans, 1963) and &quot;The Novel Now: A Student&#x27;s Guide to Contemporary Fiction&quot; (New York: W. W. Norton and Company, 1967). He wrote the Joyce studies &quot;Here Comes Everybody: An Introduction to James Joyce for the Ordinary Reader&quot; (also published as &quot;Re Joyce&quot;) and &quot;Joysprick: An Introduction to the Language of James Joyce&quot;. Also published was &quot;A Shorter &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;&quot;, Burgess&#x27;s abridgement. His 1970 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; entry on the novel (under &quot;Novel, the&quot;) is regarded as a classic of the genre. Burgess wrote full-length critical studies of William Shakespeare, Ernest Hemingway and D. H. Lawrence, as well as &quot;Ninety-nine Novels: The Best in English since 1939&quot;.

=== Screenwriting ===
Burgess wrote the screenplays for &quot;Moses the Lawgiver&quot; (Gianfranco De Bosio 1974), &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (Franco Zeffirelli 1977), and &quot;A.D.&quot; (Stuart Cooper, 1985). Burgess was co-writer of the script for the TV series &quot;Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson&quot; (1980). The film treatments he produced include &quot;Amundsen&quot;, &quot;Attila&quot;, &quot;The Black Prince&quot;, &quot;Cyrus the Great&quot;, &quot;Dawn Chorus&quot;, &quot;The Dirty Tricks of Bertoldo&quot;, &quot;Eternal Life&quot;, &quot;Onassis&quot;, &quot;Puma&quot;, &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;, &quot;Schreber&quot;, &quot;The Sexual Habits of the English Middle Class&quot;, &quot;Shah&quot;, &quot;That Man Freud&quot; and &quot;Uncle Ludwig&quot;. Burgess devised a Stone Age language for &quot;La Guerre du Feu&quot; (&quot;Quest for Fire&quot;; Jean-Jacques Annaud, 1981).

Burgess wrote many unpublished scripts, including &quot;Will!&quot; or &quot;The Bawdy Bard&quot; about Shakespeare, based on the novel &quot;Nothing Like The Sun&quot;. Encouraged by the success of &quot;Tremor of Intent&quot; (a parody of James Bond adventures), Burgess wrote a screenplay for &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; featuring characters from and a similar tone to the novel. It had Bond fighting the criminal organisation CHAOS in Singapore to try to stop an assassination of Queen Elizabeth II using surgically implanted bombs at Sydney Opera House. It was described as &quot;an outrageous medley of sadism, hypnosis, acupuncture, and international terrorism&quot;. His screenplay was rejected, although the huge submarine silo seen in the finished film was reportedly Burgess&#x27;s inspiration.

=== Playwright ===
Anthony Burgess&#x27;s involvement with theatre started while attending university in Manchester, where directed plays and wrote theatre reviews. In Oxfordshire he was an active member of the Adderbury Drama Group, where he directed multiple plays, including &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot; by Sean O&#x27;Casey, &quot;A Phoenix Too Frequent&quot; by Christopher Fry, &quot;The Giaconda Smile&quot; by Aldous Huxley and &quot;The Adding Machine&quot; by Elmer Rice.

He wrote his first play in 1951, called &quot;The Eve of Saint Venus.&quot; There are no records of the play being performed, and in 1964 he turned the text into a novella. Throughout his life he wrote multiple adaptations and translations for theatre. His most famous work &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, he adapted for the stage under the title &quot;A Clockwork Orange: A Play With Music&quot;. According to The International Anthony Burgess Foundation it had the following performances; an expanded edition of this play, with a facsimile of the handwritten score, appeared in 1999; &quot;A Clockwork Orange 2004&quot;, adapted from Burgess&#x27;s novel by the director Ron Daniels and published by Arrow Books, was produced at the Barbican Theatre in London in 1990, with music by The Edge from U2.  

His other famous translations include the English version of &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; by Edmond Rostand. Recently two of his until now unpublished translations were published by Salamander Street, and imprint of Wordville, which the Foundation called a &#x27;significant literary discovery&#x27;. One is &quot;Miser! Miser!&quot; A translation of Molière&#x27;s &quot;The Miser.&quot; Although the original French play is written in prose, Burgess remakes it in a mixture of verse and prose, in the style of his famous adaptation of &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;. The other &quot;Chatsky&quot; subtitled &quot;″The Importance of Being Stupid″&quot; based on &quot;Woe from Wit&quot; by Alexander Griboyedov. In &quot;Chatsky&quot;, Burgess remakes a classic Russian play in the spirit of Oscar Wilde.

== Music ==
An accomplished musician, Burgess composed regularly throughout his life, and once said: &quot;I wish people would think of me as a musician who writes novels, instead of a novelist who writes music on the side.&quot; He wrote more than 250 compositions in a variety of forms, including symphonies, concertos, chamber music, piano music, and works for the theatre. His early introduction to music is lightly disguised as fiction in his novel &quot;The Pianoplayers&quot; (1986). Many of his unpublished compositions are listed in &quot;This Man and Music&quot; (1982).

=== Orchestral and chamber ===
He began composing seriously while in the army during the war, and then while working as a teacher in Malaya, but could not earn a living from it. His early symphony, &quot;Sinfoni Melayu&quot; (now lost), was an attempt &quot;to combine the musical elements of the country [Malaya] into a synthetic language which called on native drums and xylophones&quot;. A second symphony has also been lost. But his Symphony No 3 in C was commissioned by the University of Iowa Symphony Orchestra in 1974, resulting in the first public performance of an orchestral work by Burgess – a momentous occasion for the composer which spurred him on to renew his composing activities with other large scale works, including a violin concerto for Yehudi Menuhin which remained unperformed due to the violinist&#x27;s death. More recently, the Symphony was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 as part of the Manchester International Festival in July 2017.

Burgess also wrote a good deal of chamber music. He wrote for the recorder as his son played the instrument. Several works for recorder and piano, including the Sonata No. 1, Sonatina and &quot;Tre Pezzetti&quot;, have been recorded by John Turner with pianist Harvey Davies. His collected guitar quartets have also been recorded by the Mēla Guitar Quartet. A recently recovered work is a string quartet from 1980, influenced by Dmitri Shostakovich, which unexpectedly turned up in the archive of the International Anthony Burgess Foundation. For piano, Burgess composed a set of 24 Preludes and Fugues, &quot;The Bad-Tempered Electronic Keyboard&quot; (1985), which has been recorded by Stephane Ginsburgh.

=== Musicals and opera ===
Burgess composed the operetta &quot;Blooms of Dublin&quot; in 1982, adapting the libretto from James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;. It is a very free interpretation of Joyce&#x27;s text, with changes and interpolations by Burgess himself, all set to original music that blends opera with Gilbert and Sullivan and music hall styles. The musical was televised by the BBC, to mixed reviews. He wrote the libretto for the 1973 Broadway musical &quot;Cyrano&quot; (music by Michael J. Lewis), using his own adaptation of the original Rostand play as his basis. Burgess also produced a translation of Meilhac and Halévy&#x27;s libretto to Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, which was performed by the English National Opera in 1986, and wrote a new libretto for Weber&#x27;s last opera &quot;Oberon&quot; (1826), reprinted alongside the original in &quot;Oberon Old and New&quot;. It was performed by the Glasgow-based Scottish Opera in 1985, but hasn&#x27;t been revived since.

=== Music and literature ===
Nearly all the writings, fiction and non-fiction, reflect his musical experiences. Biographical elements concerning musicians, particularly failed composers, occur everywhere. His early novel &quot;A Vision of Battlements&quot; (1965) concerns Richard Ennis, a composer of symphonies and concertos who is serving in the British army in Gibraltar. His last, &quot;&quot; (1995), a novel set in verse form, is about a minor modern composer who enjoys greater success in bed than he does in the concert hall. Fictional works mentioned in the novels often parallel Burgess&#x27;s own real compositions, and provide a commentary on them, such as the cantata &quot;St Celia&#x27;s Day&quot;, described in the 1976 novel &quot;Beard&#x27;s Roman Women&quot;, which surfaced two years after the novel was published as a real Burgess work.

But the musical influences go far beyond the biographical. There are experiments combining musical forms and literature. &quot;Tremor of Intent&quot; (1966), the James Bond spoof thriller, is set in sonata form. &quot;Mozart and the Wolf Gang&quot; (1991) mirrors the sound and rhythm of Mozartian composition, among other things attempting a fictional representation of Symphony No. 40. &quot;Napoleon Symphony: A Novel in Four Movements&quot; (1974) is a literary interpretation of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Eroica&quot;, while Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 features prominently in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (and in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film version of the novel).

His use of language often highlights sound over meaning – in the made-up, Russian-influenced language &quot;Nadsat&quot; used by the narrator of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, in the wordless film script &quot;Quest for Fire&quot; (1981), where he invents a tribal language that prehistoric man might have spoken, and in the non-fiction work on the sound of language, &quot;A Mouthful of Air&quot; (1992).

=== Musical enthusiasms ===
On the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; radio programme in 1966, Burgess chose as his favourite music Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Rejoice in the Lord alway&quot;; Bach&#x27;s &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; No. 13; Elgar&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 in A-flat major; Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Walter&#x27;s Trial Song&quot; from &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;; Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Fêtes&quot; from &quot;Nocturnes&quot;; Lambert&#x27;s &quot;The Rio Grande&quot;; Walton&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 in B-flat minor; and Vaughan Williams&#x27; &quot;On Wenlock Edge&quot;. A collection of essays on music by Burgess was published in 2024.
== Linguistics ==
&quot;Burgess&#x27;s linguistic training&quot;, wrote Raymond Chapman and Tom McArthur in &quot;The Oxford Companion to the English Language&quot;: &quot;...is shown in dialogue enriched by distinctive pronunciations and the niceties of register&quot;. During his years in Malaya, and after he had mastered Jawi, the Arabic script adapted for Malay, Burgess taught himself the Persian language, after which he produced a translation of Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; into Persian (unpublished). He worked on an anthology of the best of English literature translated into Malay, which failed to achieve publication. Burgess&#x27;s published translations include two versions of &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, &quot;Oedipus the King&quot; and &quot;Carmen&quot;.

Burgess&#x27;s interest in language was reflected in the invented, Anglo-Russian teen slang of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (Nadsat), and in the movie &quot;Quest for Fire&quot; (1981), for which he invented a prehistoric language (&quot;Ulam&quot;) for the characters. His interest is reflected in his characters. In &quot;The Doctor is Sick&quot;, Dr Edwin Spindrift is a lecturer in linguistics who escapes from a hospital ward which is peopled, as the critic Saul Maloff put it in a review, with &quot;brain cases who happily exemplify varieties of English speech&quot;. Burgess, who had lectured on phonetics at the University of Birmingham in the late 1940s, investigates the field of linguistics in &quot;Language Made Plain&quot; and &quot;A Mouthful of Air&quot;.

The depth of Burgess&#x27;s multilingual proficiency came under discussion in Roger Lewis&#x27;s 2002 biography. Lewis claimed that during production in Malaysia of the BBC documentary &quot;A Kind of Failure&quot; (1982), Burgess&#x27;s supposedly fluent Malay was not understood by waitresses at a restaurant where they were filming. It was claimed that the documentary&#x27;s director deliberately kept these moments intact in the film to expose Burgess&#x27;s linguistic pretensions. A letter from David Wallace that appeared in the magazine of the London &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot; newspaper on 25 November 2002 shed light on the affair. Wallace&#x27;s letter read, in part:
Lewis may not have been fully aware of the fact that a quarter of Malaysia&#x27;s population is made up of Hokkien- and Cantonese-speaking Chinese. However, Malay had been installed as the National Language with the passing of the Language Act of 1967. By 1982 all national primary and secondary schools in Malaysia would have been teaching with Bahasa Melayu as a base language (see Harold Crouch, &quot;Government and Society in Malaysia&quot;, Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1996).

== Archive ==
The largest archive of Anthony Burgess&#x27;s belongings is housed at the International Anthony Burgess Foundation in Manchester, UK. The holdings include: handwritten journals and diaries; over 8000 books from Burgess&#x27;s personal library; manuscripts of novels, journalism and musical compositions; professional and private photographs dating from between 1918 and 1993; an extensive archive of sound recordings; Burgess&#x27;s music collection; furniture; musical instruments including two of Burgess&#x27;s pianos; and correspondence that includes letters from Angela Carter, Graham Greene, Thomas Pynchon and other notable writers and publishers. The International Anthony Burgess Foundation was established by Burgess&#x27;s widow, Liana, in 2003.

Beginning in 1995, Burgess&#x27;s widow sold a large archive of his papers at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin with several additions made in subsequent years. Comprising over 136 boxes, the archive includes typed and handwritten manuscripts, sheet music, correspondence, clippings, contracts and legal documents, appointment books, magazines, photographs, and personal effects. 

A substantial amount of unpublished and unproduced music compositions is included in the collection, along with a small number of audio recordings of Burgess&#x27;s interviews and performances of his work. Over 90 books from Burgess&#x27;s library can also be found in the Ransom Center&#x27;s holdings. In 2014, the Ransom Center added the archive of Burgess&#x27;s long-time agent Gabriele Pantucci, which also includes substantial manuscripts, sheet music, correspondence, and contracts. Burgess&#x27;s archive at the Ransom Center is supplemented by significant archives of artists Burgess admired including James Joyce, Graham Greene and D. H. Lawrence.

A small collection of papers, musical manuscripts and other items was deposited with the University of Angers in 1998. Its present whereabouts are unclear.

<text>Grid computing is the use of widely distributed computer resources to reach a common goal. A computing grid can be thought of as a distributed system with non-interactive workloads that involve many files. Grid computing is distinguished from conventional high-performance computing systems such as cluster computing in that grid computers have each node set to perform a different task/application. Grid computers also tend to be more heterogeneous and geographically dispersed (thus not physically coupled) than cluster computers. Although a single grid can be dedicated to a particular application, commonly a grid is used for a variety of purposes. Grids are often constructed with general-purpose grid middleware software libraries. Grid sizes can be quite large.

Grids are a form of distributed computing composed of many networked loosely coupled computers acting together to perform large tasks. For certain applications, distributed or grid computing can be seen as a special type of parallel computing that relies on complete computers (with onboard CPUs, storage, power supplies, network interfaces, etc.) connected to a computer network (private or public) by a conventional network interface, such as Ethernet. This is in contrast to the traditional notion of a supercomputer, which has many processors connected by a local high-speed computer bus. This technology has been applied to computationally intensive scientific, mathematical, and academic problems through volunteer computing, and it is used in commercial enterprises for such diverse applications as drug discovery, economic forecasting, seismic analysis, and back office data processing in support for e-commerce and Web services.

Grid computing combines computers from multiple administrative domains to reach a common goal, to solve a single task, and may then disappear just as quickly. The size of a grid may vary from small—confined to a network of computer workstations within a corporation, for example—to large, public collaborations across many companies and networks. &quot;The notion of a confined grid may also be known as an intra-nodes cooperation whereas the notion of a larger, wider grid may thus refer to an inter-nodes cooperation&quot;.

Coordinating applications on Grids can be a complex task, especially when coordinating the flow of information across distributed computing resources. Grid workflow systems have been developed as a specialized form of a workflow management system designed specifically to compose and execute a series of computational or data manipulation steps, or a workflow, in the grid context.

==Comparison of grids and conventional supercomputers==
“Distributed” or “grid” computing in general is a special type of parallel computing that relies on complete computers (with onboard CPUs, storage, power supplies, network interfaces, etc.) connected to a network (private, public or the Internet) by a conventional network interface producing commodity hardware, compared to the lower efficiency of designing and constructing a small number of custom supercomputers. The primary performance disadvantage is that the various processors and local storage areas do not have high-speed connections. This arrangement is thus well-suited to applications in which multiple parallel computations can take place independently, without the need to communicate intermediate results between processors. The high-end scalability of geographically dispersed grids is generally favorable, due to the low need for connectivity between nodes relative to the capacity of the public Internet.

There are also some differences between programming for a supercomputer and programming for a grid computing system. It can be costly and difficult to write programs that can run in the environment of a supercomputer, which may have a custom operating system, or require the program to address concurrency issues. If a problem can be adequately parallelized, a “thin” layer of “grid” infrastructure can allow conventional, standalone programs, given a different part of the same problem, to run on multiple machines. This makes it possible to write and debug on a single conventional machine and eliminates complications due to multiple instances of the same program running in the same shared memory and storage space at the same time.

==Design considerations and variations==

One feature of distributed grids is that they can be formed from computing resources belonging to one or multiple individuals or organizations (known as multiple administrative domains). This can facilitate commercial transactions, as in utility computing, or make it easier to assemble volunteer computing networks.

One disadvantage of this feature is that the computers which are actually performing the calculations might not be entirely trustworthy. The designers of the system must thus introduce measures to prevent malfunctions or malicious participants from producing false, misleading, or erroneous results, and from using the system as an attack vector. This often involves assigning work randomly to different nodes (presumably with different owners) and checking that at least two different nodes report the same answer for a given work unit. Discrepancies would identify malfunctioning and malicious nodes. However, due to the lack of central control over the hardware, there is no way to guarantee that nodes will not drop out of the network at random times. Some nodes (like laptops or dial-up Internet customers) may also be available for computation but not network communications for unpredictable periods. These variations can be accommodated by assigning large work units (thus reducing the need for continuous network connectivity) and reassigning work units when a given node fails to report its results in the expected time.

Another set of what could be termed social compatibility issues in the early days of grid computing related to the goals of grid developers to carry their innovation beyond the original field of high-performance computing and across disciplinary boundaries into new fields, like that of high-energy physics.

The impacts of trust and availability on performance and development difficulty can influence the choice of whether to deploy onto a dedicated cluster, to idle machines internal to the developing organization, or to an open external network of volunteers or contractors. In many cases, the participating nodes must trust the central system not to abuse the access that is being granted, by interfering with the operation of other programs, mangling stored information, transmitting private data, or creating new security holes. Other systems employ measures to reduce the amount of trust “client” nodes must place in the central system such as placing applications in virtual machines.

Public systems or those crossing administrative domains (including different departments in the same organization) often result in the need to run on heterogeneous systems, using different operating systems and hardware architectures. With many languages, there is a trade-off between investment in software development and the number of platforms that can be supported (and thus the size of the resulting network). Cross-platform languages can reduce the need to make this tradeoff, though potentially at the expense of high performance on any given node (due to run-time interpretation or lack of optimization for the particular platform). Various middleware projects have created generic infrastructure to allow diverse scientific and commercial projects to harness a particular associated grid or for the purpose of setting up new grids. BOINC is a common one for various academic projects seeking public volunteers; more are listed at the end of the article.

In fact, the middleware can be seen as a layer between the hardware and the software. On top of the middleware, a number of technical areas have to be considered, and these may or may not be middleware independent. Example areas include SLA management, Trust, and Security, Virtual organization management, License Management, Portals and Data Management. These technical areas may be taken care of in a commercial solution, though the cutting edge of each area is often found within specific research projects examining the field.

==Market segmentation of the grid computing market==
For the segmentation of the grid computing market, two perspectives need to be considered: the provider side and the user side:

===The provider side===
The overall grid market comprises several specific markets. These are the grid middleware market, the market for grid-enabled applications, the utility computing market, and the software-as-a-service (SaaS) market.

Grid middleware is a specific software product, which enables the sharing of heterogeneous resources, and Virtual Organizations. It is installed and integrated into the existing infrastructure of the involved company or companies and provides a special layer placed among the heterogeneous infrastructure and the specific user applications. Major grid middlewares are Globus Toolkit, gLite, and UNICORE.

Utility computing is referred to as the provision of grid computing and applications as service either as an open grid utility or as a hosting solution for one organization or a VO. Major players in the utility computing market are Sun Microsystems, IBM, and HP.

Grid-enabled applications are specific software applications that can utilize grid infrastructure. This is made possible by the use of grid middleware, as pointed out above.

Software as a service (SaaS) is “software that is owned, delivered and managed remotely by one or more providers.” (Gartner 2007) Additionally, SaaS applications are based on a single set of common code and data definitions. They are consumed in a one-to-many model, and SaaS uses a Pay As You Go (PAYG) model or a subscription model that is based on usage. Providers of SaaS do not necessarily own the computing resources themselves, which are required to run their SaaS. Therefore, SaaS providers may draw upon the utility computing market. The utility computing market provides computing resources for SaaS providers.

===The user side===
For companies on the demand or user side of the grid computing market, the different segments have significant implications for their IT deployment strategy. The IT deployment strategy as well as the type of IT investments made are relevant aspects for potential grid users and play an important role for grid adoption.

==CPU scavenging==
CPU-scavenging, cycle-scavenging, or shared computing creates a “grid” from the idle resources in a network of participants (whether worldwide or internal to an organization). Typically, this technique exploits the &#x27;spare&#x27; instruction cycles resulting from the intermittent inactivity that typically occurs at night, during lunch breaks, or even during the (comparatively minuscule, though numerous) moments of idle waiting that modern desktop CPU&#x27;s experience throughout the day (when the computer is waiting on IO from the user, network, or storage). In practice, participating computers also donate some supporting amount of disk storage space, RAM, and network bandwidth, in addition to raw CPU power.

Many volunteer computing projects, such as BOINC, use the CPU scavenging model. Since nodes are likely to go &quot;offline&quot; from time to time, as their owners use their resources for their primary purpose, this model must be designed to handle such contingencies.

Creating an Opportunistic Environment is another implementation of CPU-scavenging where special workload management system harvests the idle desktop computers for compute-intensive jobs, it also refers as Enterprise Desktop Grid (EDG). For instance, HTCondor (the open-source high-throughput computing software framework for coarse-grained distributed rationalization of computationally intensive tasks) can be configured to only use desktop machines where the keyboard and mouse are idle to effectively harness wasted CPU power from otherwise idle desktop workstations. Like other full-featured batch systems, HTCondor provides a job queueing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme, resource monitoring, and resource management. It can be used to manage workload on a dedicated cluster of computers as well or it can seamlessly integrate both dedicated resources (rack-mounted clusters) and non-dedicated desktop machines (cycle scavenging) into one computing environment.

==History==
The term &quot;grid computing&quot; originated in the early 1990s as a metaphor for making computer power as easy to access as an electric power grid. The power grid metaphor for accessible computing quickly became canonical when Ian Foster and Carl Kesselman published their seminal work, &quot;The Grid: Blueprint for a new computing infrastructure&quot; (1999). This was preceded by decades by the metaphor of utility computing (1961): computing as a public utility, analogous to the phone system.

CPU scavenging and volunteer computing were popularized beginning in 1997 by distributed.net and later in 1999 by SETI@home to harness the power of networked PCs worldwide, in order to solve CPU-intensive research problems.

The ideas of the grid (including those from distributed computing, object-oriented programming, and Web services) were brought together by Ian Foster and Steve Tuecke of the University of Chicago, and Carl Kesselman of the University of Southern California&#x27;s Information Sciences Institute. The trio, who led the effort to create the Globus Toolkit, is widely regarded as the &quot;fathers of the grid&quot;. The toolkit incorporates not just computation management but also storage management, security provisioning, data movement, monitoring, and a toolkit for developing additional services based on the same infrastructure, including agreement negotiation, notification mechanisms, trigger services, and information aggregation. While the Globus Toolkit remains the de facto standard for building grid solutions, a number of other tools have been built that answer some subset of services needed to create an enterprise or global grid.

In 2007 the term cloud computing came into popularity, which is conceptually similar to the canonical Foster definition of grid computing (in terms of computing resources being consumed as electricity is from the power grid) and earlier utility computing.

===Progress===
In November 2006, Seidel received the Sidney Fernbach Award at the Supercomputing Conference in Tampa, Florida. &quot;For outstanding contributions to the development of software for HPC and Grid computing to enable the collaborative numerical investigation of complex problems in physics; in particular, modeling black hole collisions.&quot; This award, which is one of the highest honors in computing, was awarded for his achievements in numerical relativity.

==Fastest virtual supercomputers==
* As of March 2020, Folding@home – 1.1 exaFLOPS.
* As of April 7, 2020, BOINC – 29.8 PFLOPS.
* As of November 2019, IceCube via OSG – 350 fp32 PFLOPS.
* As of February 2018, Einstein@Home – 3.489 PFLOPS.
* As of April 7, 2020, SETI@Home – 1.11 PFLOPS.
* As of April 7, 2020, MilkyWay@Home – 1.465 PFLOPS.
* As of March 2019, GIMPS – 0.558 PFLOPS.

Also, as of March 2019, the Bitcoin Network had a measured computing power equivalent to over 80,000 exaFLOPS (Floating-point Operations Per Second). This measurement reflects the number of FLOPS required to equal the hash output of the Bitcoin network rather than its capacity for general floating-point arithmetic operations, since the elements of the Bitcoin network (Bitcoin mining ASICs) perform only the specific cryptographic hash computation required by the Bitcoin protocol.

==Projects and applications==
Grid computing offers a way to solve Grand Challenge problems such as protein folding, financial modeling, earthquake simulation, and climate/weather modeling, and was integral in enabling the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Grids offer a way of using information technology resources optimally inside an organization. They also provide a means for offering information technology as a utility for commercial and noncommercial clients, with those clients paying only for what they use, as with electricity or water.

As of October 2016, over 4 million machines running the open-source Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) platform are members of the World Community Grid. One of the projects using BOINC is SETI@home, which was using more than 400,000 computers to achieve 0.828 TFLOPS as of October 2016. As of October 2016 Folding@home, which is not part of BOINC, achieved more than 101 x86-equivalent petaflops on over 110,000 machines.

The European Union funded projects through the framework programmes of the European Commission. BEinGRID (Business Experiments in Grid) was a research project funded by the European Commission as an Integrated Project under the Sixth Framework Programme (FP6) sponsorship program. Started on June 1, 2006, the project ran 42 months, until November 2009. The project was coordinated by Atos Origin. According to the project fact sheet, their mission is “to establish effective routes to foster the adoption of grid computing across the EU and to stimulate research into innovative business models using Grid technologies”. To extract best practice and common themes from the experimental implementations, two groups of consultants are analyzing a series of pilots, one technical, one business. The project is significant not only for its long duration but also for its budget, which at 24.8 million Euros, is the largest of any FP6 integrated project. Of this, 15.7 million is provided by the European Commission and the remainder by its 98 contributing partner companies. Since the end of the project, the results of BEinGRID have been taken up and carried forward by IT-Tude.com.

The Enabling Grids for E-sciencE project, based in the European Union and included sites in Asia and the United States, was a follow-up project to the European DataGrid (EDG) and evolved into the European Grid Infrastructure. This, along with the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG), was developed to support experiments using the CERN Large Hadron Collider. A list of active sites participating within WLCG can be found online as can real time monitoring of the EGEE infrastructure. The relevant software and documentation is also publicly accessible. There is speculation that dedicated fiber optic links, such as those installed by CERN to address the WLCG&#x27;s data-intensive needs, may one day be available to home users thereby providing internet services at speeds up to 10,000 times faster than a traditional broadband connection. The European Grid Infrastructure has been also used for other research activities and experiments such as the simulation of oncological clinical trials.

The distributed.net project was started in 1997.
The NASA Advanced Supercomputing facility (NAS) ran genetic algorithms using the Condor cycle scavenger running on about 350 Sun Microsystems and SGI workstations.

In 2001, United Devices operated the United Devices Cancer Research Project based on its Grid MP product, which cycle-scavenges on volunteer PCs connected to the Internet. The project ran on about 3.1 million machines before its close in 2007.

===Definitions===
Today there are many definitions of &quot;grid computing&quot;:
*In his article “What is the Grid? A Three Point Checklist”, Ian Foster lists these primary attributes:
**Computing resources are not administered centrally.
**Open standards are used.
**Nontrivial quality of service is achieved.
* Plaszczak/Wellner define grid technology as &quot;the technology that enables resource virtualization, on-demand provisioning, and service (resource) sharing between organizations.&quot;
* IBM defines grid computing as “the ability, using a set of open standards and protocols, to gain access to applications and data, processing power, storage capacity and a vast array of other computing resources over the Internet. A grid is a type of parallel and distributed system that enables the sharing, selection, and aggregation of resources distributed across ‘multiple’ administrative domains based on their (resources) availability, capacity, performance, cost and users&#x27; quality-of-service requirements”.
* An earlier example of the notion of computing as the utility was in 1965 by MIT&#x27;s Fernando Corbató. Corbató and the other designers of the Multics operating system envisioned a computer facility operating “like a power company or water company”.
* Buyya/Venugopal define grid as &quot;a type of parallel and distributed system that enables the sharing, selection, and aggregation of geographically distributed resources dynamically at runtime depending on their availability, capability, performance, cost, and users&#x27; quality-of-service requirements&quot;.

<text>The larynx (), commonly called the voice box, is an organ in the top of the neck involved in breathing, producing sound and protecting the trachea against food aspiration. The opening of larynx into pharynx known as the laryngeal inlet is about 4–5 centimeters in diameter. The larynx houses the vocal cords, and manipulates pitch and volume, which is essential for phonation. It is situated just below where the tract of the pharynx splits into the trachea and the esophagus. The word &#x27;larynx&#x27; (: larynges) comes from the Ancient Greek word &quot;lárunx&quot; ʻlarynx, gullet, throatʼ.

== Structure ==

The triangle-shaped larynx consists largely of cartilages that are attached to one another, and to surrounding structures, by muscles or by fibrous and elastic tissue components. The larynx is lined by a ciliated columnar epithelium except for the vocal folds. The cavity of the larynx extends from its triangle-shaped inlet, to the epiglottis, and to the circular outlet at the lower border of the cricoid cartilage, where it is continuous with the lumen of the trachea. The mucous membrane lining the larynx forms two pairs of lateral folds that project inward into its cavity. The upper folds are called the vestibular folds. They are also sometimes called the false vocal cords for the rather obvious reason that they play no part in vocalization. The Kargyraa style of Tuvan throat singing makes use of these folds to sing an octave lower, and they are used in Umngqokolo, a type of Xhosa throat singing. The lower pair of folds are known as the vocal cords, which produce sounds needed for speech and other vocalizations. The slit-like space between the left and right vocal cords, called the rima glottidis, is the narrowest part of the larynx. The vocal cords and the rima glottidis are together designated as the glottis. The laryngeal cavity above the vestibular folds is called the vestibule. The very middle portion of the cavity between the vestibular folds and the vocal cords is the ventricle of the larynx, or laryngeal ventricle. The infraglottic cavity is the open space below the glottis.

===Location===
In adult humans, the larynx is found in the anterior neck at the level of the cervical vertebrae C3–C6. It connects the inferior part of the pharynx (hypopharynx) with the trachea. The laryngeal skeleton consists of nine cartilages: three single (epiglottic, thyroid and cricoid) and three paired (arytenoid, corniculate, and cuneiform). The hyoid bone is not part of the larynx, though the larynx is suspended from the hyoid. The larynx extends vertically from the tip of the epiglottis to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage. Its interior can be divided in supraglottis, glottis and subglottis.
===Cartilages===

There are nine cartilages, three unpaired and three paired (3 pairs=6), that support the mammalian larynx and form its skeleton.

Unpaired cartilages:
* Thyroid cartilage: This forms the Adam&#x27;s apple (also called the laryngeal prominence). It is usually larger in males than in females. The thyrohyoid membrane is a ligament associated with the thyroid cartilage that connects it with the hyoid bone. It supports the front portion of the larynx. 
* Cricoid cartilage: A ring of hyaline cartilage that forms the inferior wall of the larynx. It is attached to the top of the trachea. The median cricothyroid ligament connects the cricoid cartilage to the thyroid cartilage.
* Epiglottis: A large, spoon-shaped piece of elastic cartilage. During swallowing, the pharynx and larynx rise. Elevation of the pharynx widens it to receive food and drink; elevation of the larynx causes the epiglottis to move down and form a lid over the glottis, closing it off.
Paired cartilages:
* Arytenoid cartilages: Of the paired cartilages, the arytenoid cartilages are the most important because they influence the position and tension of the vocal cords. These are triangular pieces of mostly hyaline cartilage located at the posterosuperior border of the cricoid cartilage.
* Corniculate cartilages: Horn-shaped pieces of elastic cartilage located at the apex of each arytenoid cartilage.
* Cuneiform cartilages: Club-shaped pieces of elastic cartilage located anterior to the corniculate cartilages.

===Muscles===
The muscles of the larynx are divided into &quot;intrinsic&quot; and &quot;extrinsic&quot; muscles. The extrinsic muscles act on the region and pass between the larynx and parts around it but have their origin elsewhere; the intrinsic muscles are confined entirely within the larynx and have their origin and insertion there.

The intrinsic muscles are divided into respiratory and the phonatory muscles (the muscles of phonation). The respiratory muscles move the vocal cords apart and serve breathing. The phonatory muscles move the vocal cords together and serve the production of voice. The main respiratory muscles are the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles. The phonatory muscles are divided into adductors (lateral cricoarytenoid muscles, arytenoid muscles) and tensors (cricothyroid muscles, thyroarytenoid muscles).

====Intrinsic====
The intrinsic laryngeal muscles are responsible for controlling sound production.
* Cricothyroid muscle lengthen and tense the vocal cords.
* Posterior cricoarytenoid muscles abduct and externally rotate the arytenoid cartilages, resulting in abducted vocal cords.
* Lateral cricoarytenoid muscles adduct and internally rotate the arytenoid cartilages, increase medial compression.
* Transverse arytenoid muscle adduct the arytenoid cartilages, resulting in adducted vocal cords.
* Oblique arytenoid muscles narrow the laryngeal inlet by constricting the distance between the arytenoid cartilages.
* Thyroarytenoid muscles narrow the laryngeal inlet, shortening the vocal cords, and lowering voice pitch. The internal thyroarytenoid is the portion of the thyroarytenoid that vibrates to produce sound.

Notably the only muscle capable of separating the vocal cords for normal breathing is the posterior cricoarytenoid. If this muscle is incapacitated on both sides, the inability to pull the vocal cords apart (abduct) will cause difficulty breathing. Bilateral injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve would cause this condition. It is also worth noting that all muscles are innervated by the recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus except the cricothyroid muscle, which is innervated by the external laryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (a branch of the vagus).

Additionally, intrinsic laryngeal muscles present a constitutive Ca2+-buffering profile that predicts their better ability to handle calcium changes in comparison to other muscles. This profile is in agreement with their function as very fast muscles with a well-developed capacity for prolonged work. Studies suggests that mechanisms involved in the prompt sequestering of Ca2+ (sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-reuptake proteins, plasma membrane pumps, and cytosolic Ca2+-buffering proteins) are particularly elevated in laryngeal muscles, indicating their importance for the myofiber function and protection against disease, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Furthermore, different levels of Orai1 in rat intrinsic laryngeal muscles and extraocular muscles over the limb muscle suggests a role for store operated calcium entry channels in those muscles&#x27; functional properties and signaling mechanisms.

====Extrinsic====
The extrinsic laryngeal muscles support and position the larynx within the mid-cervical cereal region. 

* Sternothyroid muscles depress the larynx. (Innervated by ansa cervicalis)
* Omohyoid muscles depress the larynx. (Ansa cervicalis)
* Sternohyoid muscles depress the larynx. (Ansa cervicalis)
* Inferior constrictor muscles. (CN X)
* Thyrohyoid muscles elevates the larynx. (C1)
* Digastric elevates the larynx. (CN V3, CN VII)
* Stylohyoid elevates the larynx. (CN VII)
* Mylohyoid elevates the larynx. (CN V3)
* Geniohyoid elevates the larynx. (C1)
* Hyoglossus elevates the larynx. (CN XII)
* Genioglossus elevates the larynx. (CN XII)

===Nerve supply===
The larynx is innervated by branches of the vagus nerve on each side. Sensory innervation to the glottis and laryngeal vestibule is by the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve innervates the cricothyroid muscle. Motor innervation to all other muscles of the larynx and sensory innervation to the subglottis is by the recurrent laryngeal nerve. While the sensory input described above is (general) visceral sensation (diffuse, poorly localized), the vocal cords also receives general somatic sensory innervation (proprioceptive and touch) by the superior laryngeal nerve.

Injury to the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve causes weakened phonation because the vocal cords cannot be tightened. Injury to one of the recurrent laryngeal nerves produces hoarseness, if both are damaged the voice may or may not be preserved, but breathing becomes difficult.

===Development===
In newborn infants, the larynx is initially at the level of the C2–C3 vertebrae, and is further forward and higher relative to its position in the adult body. The larynx descends as the child grows.

==Laryngeal cavity==

The laryngeal cavity (cavity of the larynx) extends from the laryngeal inlet downwards to the lower border of the cricoid cartilage where it is continuous with that of the trachea.

It is divided into two parts by the projection of the vocal folds, between which is a narrow triangular opening, the rima glottidis.

The portion of the cavity of the larynx above the vocal folds is called the laryngeal vestibule; it is wide and triangular in shape, its base or anterior wall presenting, however, about its center the backward projection of the tubercle of the epiglottis.

It contains the vestibular folds, and between these and the vocal folds are the laryngeal ventricles.

The portion below the vocal folds is called the infraglottic cavity. It is at first of an elliptical form, but lower down it widens out, assumes a circular form, and is continuous with the tube of the trachea.

== Function ==

===Sound generation===
Sound is generated in the larynx, and that is where pitch and volume are manipulated. The strength of expiration from the lungs also contributes to loudness.

Manipulation of the larynx is used to generate a source sound with a particular fundamental frequency, or pitch. This source sound is altered as it travels through the vocal tract, configured differently based on the position of the tongue, lips, mouth, and pharynx. The process of altering a source sound as it passes through the filter of the vocal tract creates the many different vowel and consonant sounds of the world&#x27;s languages as well as tone, certain realizations of stress and other types of linguistic prosody. The larynx also has a similar function to the lungs in creating pressure differences required for sound production; a constricted larynx can be raised or lowered affecting the volume of the oral cavity as necessary in glottalic consonants.

The vocal cords can be held close together (by adducting the arytenoid cartilages) so that they vibrate (see phonation). The muscles attached to the arytenoid cartilages control the degree of opening. Vocal cord length and tension can be controlled by rocking the thyroid cartilage forward and backward on the cricoid cartilage (either directly by contracting the cricothyroids or indirectly by changing the vertical position of the larynx), by manipulating the tension of the muscles within the vocal cords, and by moving the arytenoids forward or backward. This causes the pitch produced during phonation to rise or fall. In most males the vocal cords are longer and have a greater mass than most females&#x27; vocal cords, producing a lower pitch.

The vocal apparatus consists of two pairs of folds, the vestibular folds (false vocal cords) and the true vocal cords. The vestibular folds are covered by respiratory epithelium, while the vocal cords are covered by stratified squamous epithelium. The vestibular folds are not responsible for sound production, but rather for resonance. The exceptions to this are found in Tibetan chanting and Kargyraa, a style of Tuvan throat singing. Both make use of the vestibular folds to create an undertone. These false vocal cords do not contain muscle, while the true vocal cords do have skeletal muscle.

===Other===

The most important role of the larynx is its protective function, the prevention of foreign objects from entering the lungs by coughing and other reflexive actions. A cough is initiated by a deep inhalation through the vocal cords, followed by the elevation of the larynx and the tight adduction (closing) of the vocal cords. The forced expiration that follows, assisted by tissue recoil and the muscles of expiration, blows the vocal cords apart, and the high pressure expels the irritating object out of the throat. Throat clearing is less violent than coughing, but is a similar increased respiratory effort countered by the tightening of the laryngeal musculature. Both coughing and throat clearing are predictable and necessary actions because they clear the respiratory passageway, but both place the vocal cords under significant strain.

Another important role of the larynx is abdominal fixation, a kind of Valsalva maneuver in which the lungs are filled with air in order to stiffen the thorax so that forces applied for lifting can be translated down to the legs. This is achieved by a deep inhalation followed by the adduction of the vocal cords. Grunting while lifting heavy objects is the result of some air escaping through the adducted vocal cords ready for phonation.

Abduction of the vocal cords is important during physical exertion. The vocal cords are separated by about during normal respiration, but this width is doubled during forced respiration.

During swallowing, elevation of the posterior portion of the tongue levers (inverts) the epiglottis over the glottis&#x27; opening to prevent swallowed material from entering the larynx which leads to the lungs, and provides a path for a food or liquid bolus to &quot;slide&quot; into the esophagus; the hyo-laryngeal complex is also pulled upwards to assist this process. Stimulation of the larynx by aspirated food or liquid produces a strong cough reflex to protect the lungs.

In addition, intrinsic laryngeal muscles are spared from some muscle wasting disorders, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, may facilitate the development of novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in a variety of clinical scenarios. ILM have a calcium regulation system profile suggestive of a better ability to handle calcium changes in comparison to other muscles, and this may provide a mechanistic insight for their unique pathophysiological properties

==Clinical significance==

===Disorders===
There are several things that can cause a larynx to not function properly. Some symptoms are hoarseness, loss of voice, pain in the throat or ears, and breathing difficulties. 
* Acute laryngitis is the sudden inflammation and swelling of the larynx. It is caused by the common cold or by excessive shouting. It is not serious. 
* Chronic laryngitis is caused by smoking, dust, frequent yelling, or prolonged exposure to polluted air. It is much more serious than acute laryngitis.
* Presbylarynx is a condition in which age-related atrophy of the soft tissues of the larynx results in weak voice and restricted vocal range and stamina. Bowing of the anterior portion of the vocal colds is found on laryngoscopy.
* Ulcers may be caused by the prolonged presence of an endotracheal tube.
* Polyps and vocal cord nodules are small bumps caused by prolonged exposure to tobacco smoke and vocal misuse, respectively.
* Two related types of cancer of the larynx, namely squamous cell carcinoma and verrucous carcinoma, are strongly associated with repeated exposure to cigarette smoke and alcohol.
* Vocal cord paresis is weakness of one or both vocal cords that can greatly impact daily life.
* Idiopathic laryngeal spasm.
* Laryngopharyngeal reflux is a condition in which acid from the stomach irritates and burns the larynx. Similar damage can occur with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
* Laryngomalacia is a very common condition of infancy, in which the soft, immature cartilage of the upper larynx collapses inward during inhalation, causing airway obstruction.
* Laryngeal perichondritis, the inflammation of the perichondrium of laryngeal cartilages, causing airway obstruction.
* Laryngeal paralysis is a condition seen in some mammals (including dogs) in which the larynx no longer opens as wide as required for the passage of air, and impedes respiration. In mild cases it can lead to exaggerated or &quot;raspy&quot; breathing or panting, and in serious cases can pose a considerable need for treatment.
* Duchenne muscular dystrophy, intrinsic laryngeal muscles (ILM) are spared from the lack of dystrophin and may serve as a useful model to study the mechanisms of muscle sparing in neuromuscular diseases. Dystrophic ILM presented a significant increase in the expression of calcium-binding proteins. The increase of calcium-binding proteins in dystrophic ILM may permit better maintenance of calcium homeostasis, with the consequent absence of myonecrosis. The results further support the concept that abnormal calcium buffering is involved in these neuromuscular diseases.

==Treatments==
Patients who have lost the use of their larynx are typically prescribed the use of an electrolarynx device. Larynx transplants are a rare procedure. The world&#x27;s first successful operation took place in 1998 at the Cleveland Clinic, and the second took place in October 2010 at the University of California Davis Medical Center in Sacramento.

==Other animals==

Pioneering work on the structure and evolution of the larynx was carried out in the 1920s by the British comparative anatomist Victor Negus, culminating in his monumental work &quot;The Mechanism of the Larynx&quot; (1929). Negus, however, pointed out that the descent of the larynx reflected the reshaping and descent of the human tongue into the pharynx. This process is not complete until age six to eight years. Some researchers, such as Philip Lieberman, Dennis Klatt, Bart de Boer and Kenneth Stevens using computer-modeling techniques have suggested that the species-specific human tongue allows the vocal tract (the airway above the larynx) to assume the shapes necessary to produce speech sounds that enhance the robustness of human speech. Sounds such as the vowels of the words and , [i] and [u] (in phonetic notation), have been shown to be less subject to confusion in classic studies such as the 1950 Peterson and Barney investigation of the possibilities for computerized speech recognition.

In contrast, though other species have low larynges, their tongues remain anchored in their mouths and their vocal tracts cannot produce the range of speech sounds of humans. The ability to lower the larynx transiently in some species extends the length of their vocal tract, which as Fitch showed creates the acoustic illusion that they are larger. Research at Haskins Laboratories in the 1960s showed that speech allows humans to achieve a vocal communication rate that exceeds the fusion frequency of the auditory system by fusing sounds together into syllables and words. The additional speech sounds that the human tongue enables us to produce, particularly [i], allow humans to unconsciously infer the length of the vocal tract of the person who is talking, a critical element in recovering the phonemes that make up a word.

===Non-mammals===
Most tetrapod species possess a larynx, but its structure is typically simpler than that found in mammals. The cartilages surrounding the larynx are apparently a remnant of the original gill arches in fish, and are a common feature, but not all are always present. For example, the thyroid cartilage is found only in mammals. Similarly, only mammals possess a true epiglottis, although a flap of non-cartilagenous mucosa is found in a similar position in many other groups. In modern amphibians, the laryngeal skeleton is considerably reduced; frogs have only the cricoid and arytenoid cartilages, while salamanders possess only the arytenoids.

An example of a frog that possesses a larynx is the túngara frog. While the larynx is the main sound producing organ in túngara frogs, it serves a higher significance due to its contribution to mating call, which consist of two components: &#x27;whine&#x27; and &#x27;chuck&#x27;. While &#x27;whine&#x27; induces female phonotaxis and allows species recognition, &#x27;chuck&#x27; increases mating attractiveness. In particular, the túngara frog produces &#x27;chuck&#x27; by vibrating the fibrous mass attached to the larynx.

Vocal folds are found only in mammals, and a few lizards. As a result, many reptiles and amphibians are essentially voiceless; frogs use ridges in the trachea to modulate sound, while birds have a separate sound-producing organ, the syrinx.

==History==
The ancient Greek physician Galen first described the larynx, describing it as the &quot;first and supremely most important instrument of the voice&quot;.

<text>Year 576 ([[Roman numerals|DLXXVI]]) was a leap year starting on Wednesday of the Julian calendar. The denomination 576 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* Byzantine–Sassanid War: A Persian army under King Khosrau I breaks through the Caucasus into Anatolia (modern Turkey). They attack the cities of Theodosiopolis and Caesarea, but are thwarted. Khosrau is forced to retreat and sacks Sebasteia. On the way home, he is intercepted by a Byzantine force under Justinian (&quot;magister militum&quot; of the East), and severely defeated near Melitene. The royal baggage is captured, and many Persians drown, while escaping across the Euphrates.

==== Europe ====
* Baduarius, son-in-law of the Byzantine emperor Justin II, is sent to Italy to resist the Lombard conquest. He leads an aborted counter-assault against the Lombards and dies soon after.
* The Visigoths under King Liuvigild establish the capital of their kingdom in Toledo, located in central Spain (approximate date).

==== Asia ====
* The Göktürks under Tardu cross the Cimmerian Bosporus into the Crimea, and besiege the city of Panticapaeum (Ukraine).
* Jinji becomes king of the Korean kingdom of Silla.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, friend of Muhammad (approximate date)
* Gao Shilian, chancellor of the Tang dynasty (d. 647)

== Deaths ==
* May 28 – Saint Germain, bishop of Paris
* Baduarius, Byzantine aristocrat (approximate date)

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Europe ====
* May 27 – Simeon I, emperor (&quot;tsar&quot;) of the Bulgarian Empire, dies of heart failure in his palace at Preslav after a 34-year reign. He is survived by four sons and succeeded by his second son Peter I, who signs a peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire. The peace is confirmed by Peter&#x27;s marrying Maria Lekapene (the daughter of Christopher Lekapenos, son and co-emperor of Romanos I). The treaty restores the borders to those established by several treaties (thus recognizing Bulgaria&#x27;s possession of Macedonia).
* July 12 – King Æthelstan of Wessex claims his kingdom and receives the submission of High-Reeve Ealdred I of Bamburgh and probably also of Owain ap Dyfnwal, King of Strathclyde, at Eamont Bridge. He unifies the various small kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy, creating the Kingdom of England, and also secures a pledge from King Constantine II of Scotland, that he will not ally with the Viking kings. This summer also Kings Hywel Dda of Deheubarth and Owain of Glywysing and Gwent submit to the overlordship of Æthelstan at Hereford. The borders between England and Wales are set at the River Wye.
* Summer – The Hungarians fight in Rome, helping Margrave Peter against Pope John X. They then go to southern Italy, and conquer the cities of Taranto and Oria.
* August 15 – Led by the Slavic Sabir, the Fatimids from Sicily, capture and destroy Taranto. They enslave much of the population.

==== Asia ====
* Later Baekje, one of the Later Three Kingdoms of Korea, sacks the Silla capital at Gyeongju. King Gyeongae commits suicide and Gyeongsun is placed on the throne by the Later Baekje king Kyŏn Hwŏn.
* October/November – The Qarmatian invasion of Iraq begins.
* 7 December – The Sajid emir of Adharbayjan, Yusuf ibn Abi&#x27;l-Saj is defeated and captured by the Qarmatians near Kufa.

<text>Deep Blue was a chess-playing expert system run on a unique purpose-built IBM supercomputer. It was the first computer to win a game, and the first to win a match, against a reigning world champion under regular time controls. Development began in 1985 at Carnegie Mellon University under the name ChipTest. It then moved to IBM, where it was first renamed Deep Thought, then again in 1989 to Deep Blue. It first played world champion Garry Kasparov in a six-game match in 1996, where it won one, drew two and lost three games. It was upgraded in 1997 and in a six-game re-match, it defeated Kasparov by winning two games and drawing three. Deep Blue&#x27;s victory is considered a milestone in the history of artificial intelligence and has been the subject of several books and films.

== History ==
While a doctoral student at Carnegie Mellon University, Feng-hsiung Hsu began development of a chess-playing supercomputer under the name ChipTest. The machine won the North American Computer Chess Championship in 1987 and Hsu and his team followed up with a successor, Deep Thought, in 1988. After receiving his doctorate in 1989, Hsu and Murray Campbell joined IBM Research to continue their project to build a machine that could defeat a world chess champion. Their colleague Thomas Anantharaman briefly joined them at IBM before leaving for the finance industry and being replaced by programmer Arthur Joseph Hoane. Jerry Brody, a long-time employee of IBM Research, subsequently joined the team in 1990.

After Deep Thought&#x27;s two-game 1989 loss to Kasparov, IBM held a contest to rename the chess machine: the winning name was &quot;Deep Blue&quot;, submitted by Peter Fitzhugh Brown, was a play on IBM&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Big Blue&quot;. After a scaled-down version of Deep Blue played Grandmaster Joel Benjamin, Hsu and Campbell decided that Benjamin was the expert they were looking for to help develop Deep Blue&#x27;s opening book, so hired him to assist with the preparations for Deep Blue&#x27;s matches against Garry Kasparov. In 1995, a Deep Blue prototype played in the eighth World Computer Chess Championship, playing Wchess to a draw before ultimately losing to Fritz in round five, despite playing as White.

Today, one of the two racks that made up Deep Blue is held by the National Museum of American History, having previously been displayed in an exhibit about the Information Age, while the other rack was acquired by the Computer History Museum in 1997, and is displayed in the Revolution exhibit&#x27;s &quot;Artificial Intelligence and Robotics&quot; gallery. Several books were written about Deep Blue, among them &quot;Behind Deep Blue: Building the Computer that Defeated the World Chess Champion&quot; by Deep Blue developer Feng-hsiung Hsu.

== Deep Blue versus Kasparov ==

Subsequent to its predecessor Deep Thought&#x27;s 1989 loss to Garry Kasparov, Deep Blue played Kasparov twice more. In the first game of the first match, which took place from 10 to 17 February 1996, Deep Blue became the first machine to win a chess game against a reigning world champion under regular time controls. However, Kasparov won three and drew two of the following five games, beating Deep Blue by 4–2 at the close of the match.

Deep Blue&#x27;s hardware was subsequently upgraded, doubling its speed before it faced Kasparov again in May 1997, when it won the six-game rematch 3½–2½. Deep Blue won the deciding game after Kasparov failed to secure his position in the opening, thereby becoming the first computer system to defeat a reigning world champion in a match under standard chess tournament time controls. The version of Deep Blue that defeated Kasparov in 1997 typically searched to a depth of six to eight moves, and twenty or more moves in some situations. David Levy and Monty Newborn estimate that each additional ply (half-move) of forward insight increases the playing strength between 50 and 70 Elo points.

In the 44th move of the first game of their second match, unknown to Kasparov, a bug in Deep Blue&#x27;s code led it to enter an unintentional loop, which it exited by taking a randomly selected valid move. Kasparov did not take this possibility into account, and misattributed the seemingly pointless move to &quot;superior intelligence&quot;. Subsequently, Kasparov experienced a decline in performance in the following game, though he denies this was due to anxiety in the wake of Deep Blue&#x27;s inscrutable move.

After his loss, Kasparov said that he sometimes saw unusual creativity in the machine&#x27;s moves, suggesting that during the second game, human chess players had intervened on behalf of the machine. IBM denied this, saying the only human intervention occurred between games. Kasparov demanded a rematch, but IBM had dismantled Deep Blue after its victory and refused the rematch. The rules allowed the developers to modify the program between games, an opportunity they said they used to shore up weaknesses in the computer&#x27;s play that were revealed during the course of the match. Kasparov requested printouts of the machine&#x27;s log files, but IBM refused, although the company later published the logs on the Internet.

The 1997 tournament awarded a $700,000 first prize to the Deep Blue team and a $400,000 second prize to Kasparov. Carnegie Mellon University awarded an additional $100,000 to the Deep Blue team, a prize created by computer science professor Edward Fredkin in 1980 for the first computer program to beat a reigning world chess champion.

== Aftermath ==
===Chess===
Kasparov initially called Deep Blue an &quot;alien opponent&quot; but later belittled it, stating that it was &quot;as intelligent as your alarm clock&quot;. According to Martin Amis, two grandmasters who played Deep Blue agreed that it was &quot;like a wall coming at you&quot;. Hsu had the rights to use the Deep Blue design independently of IBM, but also independently declined Kasparov&#x27;s rematch offer. In 2003, the documentary film &quot;Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine&quot; investigated Kasparov&#x27;s claims that IBM had cheated. In the film, some interviewees describe IBM&#x27;s investment in Deep Blue as an effort to boost its stock value.

===Other games===
Following Deep Blue&#x27;s victory, AI specialist Omar Syed designed a new game, Arimaa, which was intended to be very simple for humans but very difficult for computers to master; however, in 2015, computers proved capable of defeating strong Arimaa players. Since Deep Blue&#x27;s victory, computer scientists have developed software for other complex board games with competitive communities. The AlphaGo series (AlphaGo, AlphaGo Zero, AlphaZero) defeated top Go players in 2016–2017.

===Computer science===
Computer scientists such as Deep Blue developer Campbell believed that playing chess was a good measurement for the effectiveness of artificial intelligence, and by beating a world champion chess player, IBM showed that they had made significant progress. Deep Blue is also responsible for the popularity of using games as a display medium for artificial intelligence, as in the cases of IBM Watson or AlphaGo.

While Deep Blue, with its capability of evaluating 200 million positions per second, was the first computer to face a world chess champion in a formal match, it was a then-state-of-the-art expert system, relying upon rules and variables defined and fine-tuned by chess masters and computer scientists. In contrast, current chess engines such as Leela Chess Zero typically use reinforcement machine learning systems that train a neural network to play, developing its own internal logic rather than relying upon rules defined by human experts.

In a November 2006 match between Deep Fritz and world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik, the program ran on a computer system containing a dual-core Intel Xeon 5160 CPU, capable of evaluating only 8 million positions per second, but searching to an average depth of 17 to 18 plies (half-moves) in the middlegame thanks to heuristics; it won 4–2.

== Design ==
=== Software ===
Deep Blue ran under the AIX operating system, and its chess playing program was written in C. 
Its evaluation function was initially written in a generalized form, with many to-be-determined parameters (e.g., how important is a safe king position compared to a space advantage in the center, etc.). Values for these parameters were determined by analyzing thousands of master games. The evaluation function was then split into 8,000 parts, many of them designed for special positions. The opening book encapsulated more than 4,000 positions and 700,000 grandmaster games, while the endgame database contained many six-piece endgames and all five and fewer piece endgames. An additional database named the &quot;extended book&quot; summarizes entire games played by Grandmasters. The system combines its searching ability of 200 million chess positions per second with summary information in the extended book to select opening moves.

Before the second match, the program&#x27;s rules were fine-tuned by grandmaster Joel Benjamin. The opening library was provided by grandmasters Miguel Illescas, John Fedorowicz, and Nick de Firmian. When Kasparov requested that he be allowed to study other games that Deep Blue had played so as to better understand his opponent, IBM refused, leading Kasparov to study many popular PC chess games to familiarize himself with computer gameplay.

=== Hardware ===
Deep Blue used custom VLSI chips to parallelize the alpha–beta search algorithm, an example of symbolic AI. The system derived its playing strength mainly from brute force computing power. It was a massively parallel IBM RS/6000 SP Supercomputer with 30 PowerPC 604e processors and 480 custom 600 nm CMOS VLSI &quot;chess chips&quot; designed to execute the chess-playing expert system, as well as FPGAs intended to allow patching of the VLSIs (which ultimately went unused) all housed in two cabinets. The chess chip has four parts: the move generator, the smart-move stack, the evaluation function, and the search control. The move generator is a 8x8 combinational logic circuit, a chess board in miniature. 

In 1997, Deep Blue was upgraded again to become the 259th most powerful supercomputer according to the TOP500 list, achieving 11.38 GFLOPS on the parallel high performance LINPACK benchmark. Deeper Blue was capable of evaluating 200 million positions per second, twice as many as the 1996 version.

<doc id="49390" wikidata="Q1053074" url="?curid=49390" title="Cello (web browser)">
<text>Cello is an early, discontinued graphical web browser for Windows 3.1; it was developed by Thomas R. Bruce of the Legal Information Institute at Cornell Law School. It was released as shareware in 1993. While other browsers ran on various Unix machines, Cello was the first web browser for Microsoft Windows, using the winsock system to access the Internet. In addition to the basic Windows, Cello worked on Windows NT 3.5 and with small modifications on OS/2.

Cello was created because of a demand for Web access by lawyers, who were more likely to use Microsoft Windows than the Unix operating systems supporting earlier Web browsers, including the first release of Mosaic. The lack of a Windows browser meant many legal experts were unable to access legal information made available in hypertext on the World Wide Web. Cello was popular during 1993/1994, but fell out of favor following the release of Mosaic for Windows and Netscape, after which Cello development was abandoned.

Cello was first publicly released on 8 June 1993. A version 2.0 was announced, but development was abandoned. Version 1.01a, 16 April 1994, was the last public release. Since then, the Legal Information Institute at Cornell Law School has licensed the Cello 2.0 source code, which has been used to develop commercial software.

The browser is no longer available from its original homepage. However, it can still be downloaded from mirror sites.

==Development and history==

The development of Cello started in 1992, with beta versions planned for June 1993 and a release for July 1993. It was publicly announced on 12 April 1993.

The Legal Information Institute at Cornell Law School created the first law site on the
Internet in 1992 and the first legal website in 1993. However, at the time, there were no web browsers for the Microsoft Windows operating system, which was used by most lawyers. Thus, to allow lawyers to use their website, the Legal Information Institute developed the first Windows-based Web browser. This was made possible by a grant from the National Center for Automated Information Research.

Although other browsers at the time were based on CERN&#x27;s WWW libraries called libwww, PCs of the time were not powerful enough to run the UNIX-oriented code. As a result, Thomas Bruce had to rewrite most of the WWW libraries to work on Microsoft Windows. Unlike most commercial browsers at that time, Cello used none of Mosaic&#x27;s source code and thus had a different look and feel.

Steven Sinofsky, president of the Windows division at Microsoft wrote in a June 1994 email: &quot;We do not currently plan on any other client software [in the upcoming release of Windows 95], especially something like Mosaic or Cello.&quot; Nevertheless, on 11 January 1995, Microsoft announced that it had licensed the Mosaic technology from Spyglass, which it would use to create Internet Explorer. On 15 August 1995, Microsoft debuted its own web browser Internet Explorer 1 for Windows 95. While it did not ship with the original release of Windows 95, it shipped with Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95.

==Usage==
When released in 1993, Cello was the only browser for the Microsoft Windows platform. Shortly after launch, Cello was being downloaded at a rate of 500 copies per day. As such, it achieved a fair amount of use and recognition within the legal community, including a number of PC users with between 150,000 and 200,000 users. In 1994, most websites were visited using either the Cello browser or the Mosaic browser. Despite having fewer features than Mosaic, Cello continued to be used due to its simpler interface and lower system requirements. Cello was praised for being easy to install, because it wasn&#x27;t necessary to install Win32s or a TCP/IP stack for Windows 3.1. Following the release of Windows 95, which offered a much better TCP/IP interface, Cello fell into disuse and was abandoned.

By 1995, Cello, like the Mosaic browser, was overshadowed by two newer browsers — Netscape and Internet Explorer — and fell into disuse. By 1999, Cello was considered to be a &quot;historical&quot; browser.

Cello is considered to be one of the early casualties of the first browser wars.

==Features==
Cello had the following features:

Unlike Mosaic, &quot;Cello did not have toolbar buttons&quot;, and instead commands were accessed through pull-down menus.

;Supported Protocols
Cello supported the following protocols: HTTP 1.0, Gopher (but not Gopher+), read-only FTP, SMTP mailing, Telnet, Usenet, CSO/ph/qi directly and WAIS, HyTelnet, TechInfo, Archie, X.500, TN3270 and a number of others through public gateways.

;Supported FTP servers
Cello supported the following FTP servers: most Unix servers (including SunOS, System V, and Linux), IBM VM, VMS systems, Windows NT, QVTNet, NCSA/CUTCP/Rutgers PC servers, FTP Software PC server, HellSoft NLM for Novell.

;Internet Connection
Cello works best with a direct Ethernet connection, but it also supports SLIP and PPP dialup connections through the use of asynchronous sockets. Cello has an integrated TCP/IP runtime stack.

==Release history==

The following versions were released:

Although Cello 2.0 had been announced, development ceased before a public release.

IBM released a fix for their TCP/IP V2.0 stack so that Cello would work with OS/2 WinOS/2 on 9 February 1994.

==Browser comparison table==
The following table shows how Cello compared to browsers of its time.

==Derivatives==
* The first edition of BURKS, a project to produce non-profit CD-ROMs of resources for students of Computer Science, was based on Cello.
* InterAp, by California Software Inc, was based on Cello and featured a web browser with Telnet, FTP, and a Visual Basic-compatible scripting language called NetScripts.
* A version of Lovelace came bundled with Cello.

==Technical==
While originally Cello required the Distinct Corporation&#x27;s TCP/IP stack, with the release of Cello Beta Version .8, Cello dropped support for Distinct, and became exclusively Winsock-based.

Originally, although Cello could run on OS/2, OS/2&#x27;s implementation of Winsock had bugs that prevented Cello from accessing the Internet. The bug, &quot;APAR #PN52335&quot;, was later fixed allowing Cello to properly work on OS/2.

The user agent for Cello is codice_1.

===DDE support===
Cello featured Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) support. OLE support and DDE client support were planned, but never released.

An example of how to invoke Cello from a Microsoft Word macro:

Sub MAIN
ChanNum = DDEInitiate(&quot;Cello&quot;, &quot;URL&quot;)
DDEExecute(ChanNum, &quot;http://www.law.cornell.edu&quot;)
DDETerminate(ChanNum)
End Sub
==System requirements==
Cello has the following system requirements:

* Processor: 80386(386SX) at 16 MHz or better
* Operating system: Windows 3.1 / 3.11 / Windows NT 3.5 / OS/2.
* Ram: 2 MB RAM, 4 MB RAM recommended

==Criticism==
Cello was not very stable and its development halted early.

Cello did not render graphics well and required that the user reload the webpage when resizing the window. Like most browsers at the time, Cello also did not support any web security protocols. It was also said that Cello rendered html &quot;crudely&quot; and pages would appear jaggedly.

Cello also had sub-par performance in accessing the Internet and processing hypermedia documents.

<text>Affirmative action (also sometimes called reservations, alternative access, positive discrimination or positive action in various countries&#x27; laws and policies) refers to a set of policies and practices within a government or organization seeking to address systemic discrimination. Historically and internationally, support for affirmative action has been justified by the idea that it may help with bridging inequalities in employment and pay, increasing access to education, and promoting diversity, social equity, and social inclusion and redressing alleged wrongs, harms, or hindrances, also called substantive equality.

The nature of affirmative-action policies varies from region to region and exists on a spectrum from a hard quota to merely targeting encouragement for increased participation. Some countries use a quota system, reserving a certain percentage of government jobs, political positions, and school vacancies for members of a certain group; an example of this is the reservation system in India. In some other jurisdictions where quotas are not used, minority-group members are given preference or special consideration in selection processes. In the United States, affirmative action by executive order originally meant selection without regard to race but preferential treatment was widely used in college admissions, as upheld in the 2003 Supreme Court case &quot;Grutter v. Bollinger&quot;, until 2023, when this was overturned in &quot;Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard.&quot;

A variant of affirmative action more common in Europe is known as positive action, wherein equal opportunity is promoted by encouraging underrepresented groups into a field. This is often described as being &quot;color blind&quot;, but some American sociologists have argued that this is insufficient to achieve substantive equality of outcomes based on race.

In the United States, affirmative action is controversial and public opinion on the subject is divided. Supporters of affirmative action argue that it promotes substantive equality for group outcomes and representation for groups, which are socio-economically disadvantaged or have faced historical discrimination or oppression. Opponents of affirmative action have argued that it is a form of reverse discrimination, that it tends to benefit the most privileged within minority groups at the expense of the least fortunate within majority groups, or that—when applied to universities—it can hinder minority students by placing them in courses for which they have not been adequately prepared.

==Origins==
The term &quot;affirmative action&quot; was first used in the United States in &quot;Executive Order No. 10925&quot;, signed by President John F. Kennedy on 6 March 1961, which included a provision that government contractors &quot;take &quot;affirmative action&quot; to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated [fairly] during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin&quot;. In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued Executive Order 11246 which required government employers to &quot;hire without regard to race, religion and national origin&quot; and &quot;take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, color, religion, sex or national origin.&quot; The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. Neither executive order nor The Civil Rights Act authorized group preferences. The Senate floor manager of the bill, Senator Hubert Humphrey, declared that the bill “would prohibit preferential treatment for any particular group” adding “I will eat my hat if this leads to racial quotas.”
 However affirmative action in practice would eventually become synonymous with preferences, goals and quotas as upheld or struck down by Supreme Court decisions even though no law had been passed explicitly permitting discrimination in favor of disadvantaged groups. 
Some state laws explicitly banned racial preferences, and in response some laws have failed attempting to explicitly legalize race preferences.

Affirmative action is intended to alleviate under-representation and to promote the opportunities of defined minority groups within a society to give them equal access to that of the majority population. The philosophical basis of the policy has various rationales, including but not limited to compensation for past discrimination, correction of current discrimination, and the diversification of society. It is often implemented in governmental and educational settings to ensure that designated groups within a society can participate in all promotional, educational, and training opportunities.

The stated justification for affirmative action by its proponents is to help compensate for past discrimination, persecution or exploitation by the ruling class of a culture, and to address existing discrimination. More recently concepts have moved beyond discrimination to include diversity, equity and inclusion as motives for preferring historically underrepresented groups.

==Methods of implementation==
* Quotas
* Specific scholarships and financial aid for certain groups
* Marketing/advertising to groups that the affirmative action is intended to increase
* Specific training or emulation actions for identified audiences
* Relaxation of selection criteria applied to a target audiences

==Women==

Several different studies investigated the effect of affirmative action on women. Kurtulus (2012) in her review of affirmative action and the occupational advancement of minorities and women during 1973–2003 showed that the effect of affirmative action on advancing black, Hispanic, and white women into management, professional, and technical occupations occurred primarily during the 1970s and early 1980s. During this period, contractors grew their shares of these groups more rapidly than non-contractors because of the implementation of affirmative action. But the positive effect of affirmative action vanished entirely in the late 1980s, which Kurtulus says may be due to the slowdown into advanced occupation for women and minorities because of the political shift of affirmative action that started with President Reagan. Becoming a federal contractor increased white women&#x27;s share of professional occupations by 0.183 percentage points, or 9.3 percent, on average during these three decades, and increased black women&#x27;s share by 0.052 percentage points (or by 3.9 percent). Becoming a federal contractor also increased Hispanic women&#x27;s and black men&#x27;s share of technical occupations on average by 0.058 percent and 0.109 percentage points respectively (or by 7.7 and 4.2 percent). These represent a substantial contribution of affirmative action to overall trends in the occupational advancement of women and minorities over the three decades under the study. A reanalysis of multiple scholarly studies, especially in Asia, considered the impact of four primary factors on support for affirmative action programs for women: gender; political factors; psychological factors; and social structure. Kim and Kim (2014) found that, &quot;Affirmative action both corrects existing unfair treatment and gives women equal opportunity in the future.&quot;

==Quotas==
Law regarding quotas and affirmative action varies widely from nation to nation.

Caste-based and other group-based quotas are used in the reservation system.

In 2012, the European Union Commission approved a plan for women to constitute 40% of non-executive board directorships in large listed companies in Europe by 2020. Directive (EU) 2022/2381 requires that EU member states adopt by 28 December 2024 laws to ensure that by 30 June 2026 members of the underrepresented sex hold at least 40% of non-executive director positions and at least 33% of all director positions, including both executive and non-executive directors, for listed companies. Directive (EU) 2022/2381 expires on 31 December 2038.

In Sweden, the Supreme Court has ruled that &quot;affirmative action&quot; ethnic quotas in universities are discrimination and hence unlawful. It said that the requirements for the intake should be the same for all. The justice minister said that the decision left no room for uncertainty.

==National approaches==
In some countries that have laws on racial equality, affirmative action is rendered illegal because it does not treat all races equally. This approach of equal treatment is sometimes described as being &quot;color blind&quot;, in hopes that it is effective against discrimination without engaging in reverse discrimination.

In such countries, the focus tends to be on ensuring equal opportunity and, for example, targeted advertising campaigns to encourage ethnic minority candidates to join the police force. This is sometimes called positive action.

===Africa===
====South Africa====

Between 1948 and 1974, the apartheid government introduced statutes which enshrined racial discrimination in all areas of life. Individuals were classified in a racial hierarchy which placed whites at the top, followed by &quot;Coloureds&quot;, 
then Asians or Indians, with black Africans at the bottom. Benefits were afforded based on this hierarchy, and favoured white-owned, especially Afrikaner-owned companies, which marginalised and excluded black people and limited their employment opportunities. Legislation meant that skilled and highly paid jobs were reserved for white people, and black people were largely used as cheap, unskilled labour, creating and extending the &quot;colour bar&quot; in South African labour. The variation in skills and productivity between groups of people ultimately caused disparities in employment, occupation, and income within labour markets. Following the end of apartheid, affirmative action legislation aimed to address these disparities.

The African National Congress-led government chose to implement affirmative action legislation to correct previous imbalances (a policy known as employment equity), and fulfil the obligations of the Republic as a member of the International Labour Organisation. As a result of the Employment Equity Act and the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment Act, companies were required to employ previously disenfranchised groups (blacks, Indians, and Coloureds), as well as women and disabled people. 

Many have embraced these acts; others have criticised them. Proponents have said that South African affirmative action legislation aims to promote economic growth rather than to redistribute wealth, address vast racial inequalities in wealth and income, and to restore equal access to the benefits of society. Critics suggest these laws limit the free market, raise costs, reduce economic growth, and advantage the black middle class over poorer blacks and other groups. The Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa ruled that while blacks may be favoured in principle, in practice this should not lead to unfair discrimination against others.

====Ghana==== 

The Parliament of Ghana passed the Affirmative Action Bill on July 30, 2024. The bill aims to increase the number of women in politics, with a target of 30% by 2026, 35% by 2028 and 50% by 2030. The 2024 Ghanaian general election in December was the first with affirmative action legislation in place. In the election campaign, both the ruling New Patriotic Party and the main opposition party NDC voiced their commitment to the targets, in an effort to appeal to women voters. After the election, the number of women remained the same as after the 2020 election (15%). In his inaugural speech on 7 January 2025, the newly elected President John Mahama said the NDC was committed to &quot;breaking the glass ceiling&quot; for women in politics.

===Asia===
====China====

There is affirmative action in education for minority nationalities in China, this may equate to lowering minimum requirements for the National University Entrance Examination, which is a mandatory exam for all students to enter university. Liangshaoyikuan refers a policy in China on affirmative action in criminal justice.

====Israel====
A class-based affirmative action policy was incorporated into the admission practices of the four most selective universities in Israel during the early to mid-2000s. In evaluating the eligibility of applicants, neither their financial status nor their national or ethnic origins are considered; the emphasis is on structural disadvantages, especially neighborhood socioeconomic status and high school rigor, although several individual hardships are also weighed. This policy made the four institutions, especially the echelons at the most selective departments, more diverse than they otherwise would have been. Proponents of this model have said that rising geographic, economic and demographic diversity of the student population suggests the focus on structural determinants of disadvantage yields broad diversity dividends.

In civil service employment, Israeli citizens who are women, Arabs, Blacks or people with disabilities are supported by affirmative action policies. Israeli citizens who are Arabs, Blacks or people with disabilities are also entitled to full university scholarships from the state.

====India====
Reservation in India is a form of affirmative action designed to improve the well-being of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SC/ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC), defined primarily by their caste. Members of these categories comprise about two-thirds of the population of India. According to the Constitution of India, up to 50% of all government-run higher education admissions and government job vacancies may be reserved for members of the SC/ST/OBC-NCL categories, and 10% for those in Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), with the remaining unreserved. In 2014, the Indian National Sample Survey found that 12% of surveyed Indian households had received academic scholarships, with 94% being on account of SC/ST/OBC membership, 2% based on financial weakness and 0.7% based on merit.

====Indonesia====
Indonesia has offered affirmative action for native Papuans in education, government civil worker selection, and police &amp; army selection. After the 2019 Papua protests, many Papuan students chose to abandon their scholarship and return to their respective provinces. The program has been subject to criticism, with complaints made towards a lack of sufficient quotas and alleged corruption. Prabowo Subianto, Indonesian defense minister, has expressed that he will direct more effort towards recruiting Papuans to the Indonesian National Armed Forces. Education scholarship by Ministry of Education and Culture, called ADik to the native Papuans and students from perhipery regions close to Indonesian border.

====Malaysia====
The Malaysian New Economic Policy (NEP) is a form of ethnicity-based affirmative action aimed at addressing socioeconomic disadvantages among those who are deemed &quot;Bumiputera&quot;, which includes the Malay population, Orang Asli, and the indigenous people of Sabah and Sarawak, who together form a majority of the population. Within Malaysia, the Malays (representing 58% of the population) have lower incomes than Chinese Malaysians (22% of the population) and Indian Malaysians (6% of the population), who have traditionally been involved in businesses and industries, and who were also general migrant workers. The mean income for Malays, Chinese and Indians in 1957/58 were 134, 288 and 228 respectively. In 1967/68 it was 154, 329 and 245, and in 1970 it was 170, 390 and 300. Mean income disparity ratio for Chinese/Malays rose from 2.1 in 1957/58 to 2.3 in 1970, whereas for Indians/Malays the disparity ratio also rose from 1.7 to 1.8 in the same period.

To address these inequalities, following the sectarian violence of the 13 May incident in 1969, the NEP was introduced as a time-limited policy, which was supposed to expire after 20 years but remains policy to this day. Although the NEP has succeeded in creating a significant urban Malay and Native Bornean middle class, it has been less effective in eradicating poverty among rural communities. Critics say it has widened disparities between the wealthy and middle classes, and those who are poorest. It has also been described as racially discriminatory.

====Taiwan====
A 2004 legislation requires that, for a firm with 100 employees or more wishing to compete for government contracts, at least 1 percent of its employees must be Taiwanese aborigines. Ministry of Education and Council of Aboriginal Affairs announced in 2002 that Taiwanese Aboriginal students would have their high-school or undergraduate entrance exams boosted by 33% for demonstrating some knowledge of their tribal language and culture. The percentage of boost have been revised several times, and the latest percentage is 35% in 2013.

===Europe===

==== Denmark ====
Greenlanders have special advantages when applying for university, college or vocation university degrees in Denmark. With these specific rules, Greenlanders can get into degrees without the required grade averages by fulfilling certain criteria. They need to have a grade average of over 6,0 and have lived a certain number of years in Greenland. These rules have been in force since 1 January 2014.

==== Finland ====
In certain university education programs, including legal and medical education, there are quotas for persons who reach a certain standard of skills in the Swedish language; for students admitted in these quotas, the education is partially arranged in Swedish. The purpose of the quotas is to guarantee that a sufficient number of professionals with skills in Swedish are educated for nationwide needs.

==== France ====
No distinctions based on race, religion or sex are allowed under the 1958 French Constitution. Since the 1980s, a French version of affirmative action based on neighborhood is in place for primary and secondary education. Some schools, in neighborhoods labeled &quot;Priority Education Zones&quot;, are granted more funds than the others. Students from these schools also benefit from special policies in certain institutions (such as Sciences Po).

The French Ministry of Defence tried in 1990 to make it easier for young French soldiers of North-African descent to be promoted in rank and obtain driving licenses. After a strong protest by a young French lieutenant in the Ministry of Defence newspaper (&quot;Armées d&#x27;aujourd&#x27;hui&quot;), the driving license and rank plan was cancelled. After the Sarkozy election, a new attempt in favour of Arab-French students was made, but Sarkozy did not gain enough political support to change the French constitution.

After 27 January 2014, following the Norwegian example, women had to represent at least 20% of board members in all stock-exchange-listed or state-owned companies. After 27 January 2017, the proportion increased to 40%. All appointments of men as directors were deemed invalid as long as the quotas were not met, and monetary penalties may apply for other directors.

==== Germany ====
Article 3 of the German Basic Law provides for equal rights of all people regardless of sex, race or social background. There are programs stating that if men and women have equal qualifications, women have to be preferred for a job; moreover, the disabled should be preferred to non-disabled people. This is typical for all positions in state and university service , typically using the phrase &quot;We try to increase diversity in this line of work&quot;. In recent years, there has been a long public debate about whether to issue programs that would grant women a privileged access to jobs in order to fight discrimination. Germany&#x27;s &quot;Left Party&quot; brought up the discussion about affirmative action in Germany&#x27;s school system. According to Stefan Zillich, quotas should be &quot;a possibility&quot; to help working class children who did not do well in school gain access to a &quot;Gymnasium&quot; (University-preparatory school). Headmasters of &quot;Gymnasien&quot; have objected, saying that this type of policy would &quot;be a disservice&quot; to poor children.

==== Norway ====
The boards of all public stock companies (ASA) in Norway should have at least 40% of either gender. This affects roughly 400 companies of over 300,000 in total. In their study of the effects of affirmative action on presence, prominence, and social capital of women directors in Norway, researchers Seierstad &amp; Opsahl found that, when the affirmative action policy was first implemented, only 7 prominent directors were women and 84 were men. By August 2009, this had risen to 107 women compared to 117 men. The proportion of boards led by a woman remained low overall, but increased from 3.4% to 4.3%. By applying more restrictive definitions of prominence, the proportion of directors who were women generally increased. If only considering directors with at least three directorships, 61.4% of them were women. When considering directors with seven or more directorships, all of them were women. A 2016 study found no effect of the ASA representation requirement on either valuation or profits of the affected companies, and also no correlation between the requirement and the restructuring of companies away from ASA.

==== Romania ====
Romani people are allocated quotas for access to public schools and state universities.

==== Soviet Union and Russia ====
Soon after the 1918 revolution, Inessa Armand, Lenin&#x27;s secretary and lover, was instrumental in creating Zhenotdel, which functioned until the 1930s as part of the international egalitarian and affirmative action movements. Quota systems existed in the USSR for various social groups including ethnic minorities, women and factory workers. Before 1934 ethnic minorities were described as culturally backward, but in 1934 this term was found inappropriate. In 1920s and early 1930s Korenizatsiia applied affirmative action to ethnic minorities. Quotas for access to university education, offices in the Soviet system and the Communist Party existed: for example, the position of First Secretary of a Soviet Republic&#x27;s (or Autonomous Republic&#x27;s) Party Committee was always filled by a representative of this republic&#x27;s &quot;titular ethnicity&quot;. Russia retains this system partially. Quotas are abolished, but preferences for some ethnic minorities and inhabitants of certain territories remain.

==== Serbia ====
The Constitution of the Republic of Serbia from 2006 established the principles of equality and the prohibition of discrimination on any grounds. It also allows affirmative action as &quot;special measures&quot; for certain marginalized groups, such as national minorities, by specifically excluding it from the legal definition of discrimination. The Roma national minority is enabled to enroll in public schools under more favorable conditions.

==== Slovakia ====
The Constitutional Court declared in October 2005 that affirmative action—i.e., &quot;providing advantages for people of an ethnic or racial minority group&quot;—was against its Constitution.

==== United Kingdom ====

In the United Kingdom, hiring someone simply because of their protected-group status, without regard to their performance, is illegal. By default, so is any other form of discrimination, quota or favouritism based on such &quot;protected characteristics&quot; in education, in employment, during commercial transactions, at private clubs or associations, and while using public services. 

The Equality Act 2010 does allow for membership in a protected and disadvantaged group to be considered in hiring and promotion when the group is under-represented in a given area and if the candidates are of equal merit (in which case membership in a disadvantaged group can become a &quot;tie-breaker&quot;). Under Section 159 of the Equality Act 2010, an employer must &quot;reasonably think that people with the protected characteristic suffer a disadvantage or are under-represented in that particular activity&quot; and any positive action must be &quot;a proportionate means of enabling or encouraging people to overcome the disadvantage or to take part in the activity&quot;. Specific exemptions include:
* As part of the Northern Ireland Peace Process, the Good Friday Agreement and the resulting Patten report, the Police Service of Northern Ireland are requires to recruit 50% of its numbers from the Catholic community and 50% from the Protestant and other communities, in order to reduce any possible bias towards Protestants. This was later referred to as the &quot;50:50&quot; measure.
* The Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002 allowed the use of all-women shortlists to select more women as election candidates.

In a 2019, an employment tribunal, found that &quot;while positive action can be used to boost diversity, it should only be applied to distinguish between candidates who were all equally well qualified for a role&quot;.

=== North America ===

==== Canada ====

The equality section of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms explicitly permits affirmative action legislation, although the Charter does not &quot;require&quot; legislation that gives preferential treatment. Subsection 2 of Section 15 states that the equality provisions do &quot;not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability&quot;.

The Canadian Employment Equity Act requires employers in federally-regulated industries to give preferential treatment to four designated groups: women, persons with disabilities, aboriginal peoples, and visible minorities. Less than one-third of Canadian Universities offer alternative admission requirements for students of aboriginal descent. Some provinces and territories also have affirmative action policies. For example, in the Northwest Territories in the Canadian north, aboriginal people are given preference for jobs and education and are considered to have P1 status. Non-aboriginal people who were born in the NWT or have resided half of their life there are considered a P2, as well as women and people with disabilities.

==== United States ====

The United States&#x27; policy of affirmative action dates to the Reconstruction Era in the United States, 1863–1877. Current policy was introduced in the early 1960s in the United States, as a way to combat racial discrimination in the hiring process, with the concept later expanded to address gender discrimination. During this time, the legal and constitutional legitimacy of affirmative action has been the subject of several court cases.

Affirmative action was first created from Executive Order 10925, which was signed by President John F. Kennedy on 6 March 1961 and required that government employers &quot;not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, creed, color, or national origin&quot; and &quot;take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin&quot; but did not require or permit group preferences.

On 24 September 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Executive Order 11246, thereby replacing Executive Order 10925, but continued to use the same terminology that did not require or permit group preferences. Affirmative action was extended to sex by Executive Order 11375 which amended Executive Order 11246 on 13 October 1967, by adding &quot;sex&quot; to the list of protected categories. In the U.S. affirmative action&#x27;s original purpose was to pressure institutions into compliance with the nondiscrimination mandate of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Civil Rights Acts do not cover discrimination based on veteran status, disabilities, or age that is 40 years and older. These groups may be protected from discrimination under different laws. 

Some colleges use financial criteria to attract racial groups that have typically been under-represented and typically have lower living conditions. Some states such as California (California Civil Rights Initiative), Michigan (Michigan Civil Rights Initiative), and Washington (Initiative 200) have passed constitutional amendments banning public institutions, including public schools, from practicing affirmative action within their respective states. 

Since the 1990s, conservative groups have increasingly suggested that college quotas have been used to illegally discriminate against people on the basis of race, and have launched numerous lawsuits to stop them. In 2003, a Supreme Court decision regarding affirmative action in higher education (&quot;Grutter v. Bollinger&quot;, 539 US 244 – Supreme Court 2003) permitted educational institutions to consider race as a factor when admitting students. In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court held that &quot;States may choose to prohibit the consideration of racial preferences in governmental decisions&quot;. By that time eight states, Oklahoma, New Hampshire, Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, Michigan, Florida, Washington and California, had already banned affirmative action. On June 29, 2023, the Supreme Court ruled 6–2 that the use of race in college admissions is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment in &quot;Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard&quot;.

=== Oceania ===

==== New Zealand ====
Individuals of Māori or other Polynesian descent are often afforded improved access to university courses, or have scholarships earmarked specifically for them. Such access to University courses have in the past faced criticism, particularly at the University of Auckland due to a phenomenon known as Mismatch theory, accusations of setting the kids up to fail have been made due to a lack of transparency as to the preferred groups graduation rates and the university informing the students of such historical statistics dating back to the 1970s. 

Affirmative action is provided for under section 73 of the Human Rights Act 1993 and section 19(2) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Affirmative action in New Zealand is most often done indirecttly by encouraging those in groups favored by affirmative action to get jobs in sectors they are underrepresented in. Diversity Awards NZ is an organization in New Zealand whose goal is to &quot; celebrate excellence in workplace diversity, equity and inclusion.&quot;

Under section 73 of the Human Rights Act 1993, affirmative action would be permissible if:

# Done in good faith;
# For the purpose of assisting individuals or groups with a characteristic pertaining to a prohibited ground of discrimination; and
# The individuals or groups in question need (or may reasonably be supposed to need) assistance in order to achieve an equal place with other members of the community.

=== South America ===

==== Brazil ====
Some Brazilian universities (state and federal) have created systems of preferred admissions (quotas) for racial minorities (blacks and Amerindians), the poor and people with disabilities. There are also quotas of up to 20% of vacancies reserved for people with disabilities in the civil public services. The Democrats party, accusing the board of directors of the University of Brasília for &quot;resurrecting Nazist ideals&quot;, appealed to the Supreme Federal Court against the constitutionality of the quotas the university reserves for minorities. The Supreme Court unanimously approved their constitutionality on 26 April 2012.

== International organizations ==

=== United Nations ===
The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination stipulates (in Article 2.2) that affirmative action programs may be required of countries that ratified the convention, in order to rectify systematic discrimination. It states, however, that such programs &quot;shall in no case entail as a consequence the maintenance of unequal or separate rights for different racial groups after the objectives for which they were taken have been achieved&quot;.

The United Nations Human Rights Committee states that &quot;the principle of equality sometimes requires States parties to take affirmative action in order to diminish or eliminate conditions which cause or help to perpetuate discrimination prohibited by the Covenant. For example, in a State where the general conditions of a certain part of the population prevent or impair their enjoyment of human rights, the State should take specific action to correct those conditions. Such action may involve granting for a time to the part of the population concerned certain preferential treatment in specific matters as compared with the rest of the population. However, as long as such action is needed to correct discrimination, in fact, it is a case of legitimate differentiation under the Covenant.&quot;

== Responses ==
Proponents of affirmative action say it aims to promote societal equality through the preferential treatment of socioeconomically disadvantaged people. Often, these people are disadvantaged for historical reasons, such as oppression or slavery.
Historically and internationally, support for affirmative action has sought to achieve a range of goals: bridging inequalities in employment and pay; increasing access to education; enriching state, institutional, and professional leadership with the full spectrum of society; redressing apparent past wrongs, harms, or hindrances, in particular addressing the apparent social imbalance left in the wake of slavery and slave laws. Critics of affirmative action have suggested that affirmative action hinders reconciliation, replaces old wrongs with new wrongs, undermines the achievements of minorities, and encourages individuals to identify themselves as disadvantaged, even if they are not. It may increase racial tension and benefit the more privileged people within minority groups at the expense of the least fortunate within majority groups. 

A 2017 study of temporary federal affirmative action regulation in the United States estimated that the regulation &quot;increases the black share of employees over time: in 5 years after an establishment is first regulated, the black share of employees increases by an average of 0.8 percentage points. Strikingly, the black share continues to grow at a similar pace even after an establishment is deregulated. [The author] argue[s] that this persistence is driven in part by affirmative action inducing employers to improve their methods for screening potential hires.&quot;

Legal scholar Stanley Fish suggests that opponents of affirmative action often argue it is a form of reverse discrimination, and that any effort to cure discrimination through affirmative action is wrong because it, in turn, is another form of discrimination. He says this is a false equivalence, since those opposed to affirmative action are motivated &quot;not from any wrong done to [them]&quot; but by a desire to continue marginalizing others. Journalist Vann R. Newkirk II says that critics of affirmative action often claim court cases such as &quot;Fisher v. University of Texas&quot;, which held that colleges have some discretion to consider race when making admissions decisions, demonstrate that discrimination occurs in the name of affirmative action. He says this is one of several &quot;misconceptions&quot; often used to engender &quot;white resentment&quot; in opposition to affirmative action. 

According to scholar George Sher, some critics of affirmative action say that it devalues the accomplishments of individuals chosen only based on the social groups to which they belong rather than their qualifications. Legal scholar Tseming Yang and others have discussed the challenges of fraudulent self-identification when implementing affirmative action policies. Yang suggests that because some individuals from non-preferred groups may designate themselves as members of preferred groups to access the benefits of such programs, this requires the &quot;necessary evil&quot; of verifying individuals&#x27; race to prevent this. Critics of affirmative action also suggest that programs may benefit the members of the targeted group that least need the benefit—that is, those who have the greatest social, economic and educational advantages within the targeted group—or may lead the beneficiaries of affirmative action to conclude that it is unnecessary to work as hard, and those who do not benefit may perceive hard work as futile. Political scientist Charles Murray has said that beneficiaries are often wholly unqualified for the opportunity made available, citing his belief in the innate differences between races. He reaffirmed these views in his essay &quot;The Advantages of Social Apartheid&quot;, in which he advocates separation of people based on race and intelligence. 

=== Mismatching ===
&quot;Mismatching&quot; is the proposed negative effect affirmative action has when it places a student into a college that is too difficult for them based on meeting quotas, which may increase the chance they drop out or fail the course, thus hurting the intended beneficiaries of affirmative action. According to this theory, in the absence of affirmative action, a student may be admitted to a college that matches their academic ability and therefore has a better chance of graduating. 

In 2017, researcher Andrew J. Hill found that affirmative action bans resulted in a reduction in minority students completing four-year STEM degrees, and suggests this indicates that the mismatch hypothesis is unfounded. He says this is evidence that affirmative action may be effective in &quot;some circumstances&quot;, such as in encouraging greater minority engagement in STEM degrees. In 2020, researcher Zachary Bleemer found that an affirmative action ban in California (Prop 209) had resulted in average wage drops of 5% annually among underrepresented minorities aged 24–34 in STEM industries, especially effecting Hispanic people.

In 2007, Gail Heriot, a professor of law at the University of San Diego and a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, discussed the evidence in support of mismatching in law courses. She pointed to a study by Richard Sander which suggests there were 7.9% fewer Black attorneys than if there had been no affirmative action. Sander suggests that mismatching meant Black students were more likely to drop out of law school and fail bar exams. Sander&#x27;s paper on mismatching has been criticized by several law professors, including Ian Ayres and Richard Brooks from Yale, who argue that eliminating affirmative action would actually reduce the number of
Black lawyers by 12.7%. Furthermore, they suggest that students attending higher ranking colleges do better than those who don&#x27;t. A 2008 study by Jesse Rothstein and Albert H. Yoon said Sander&#x27;s results were &quot;plausible&quot;, but said that eliminating affirmative action would &quot;lead to a 63 percent decline in black matriculants at all law schools and a 90 percent decline at elite law schools&quot;. They dismissed the mismatch theory, concluding that &quot;one cannot credibly invoke mismatch effects to argue that there are no benefits&quot; to affirmative action. In a 2016 review of previous studies by Peter Arcidiacono and Michael Lovenheim, they suggested that more African-American students attending less-selective schools would significantly improve first-attempt pass rates at the state bar, but cautioned that such improvements could be outweighed by decreases in law school attendance.

A 2011 study of data held by Duke University said there was no evidence of mismatch, and proposed that mismatch could only occur if a selective school possessed private information about students&#x27; prospects at the college which it failed to share. Providing such information to prospective students would avoid mismatch because the students could choose another school that was a better match. A 2016 study on affirmative action in India said there was no evidence for the mismatching hypothesis.

=== Polls ===
According to a poll taken by &quot;USA Today&quot; in 2005, the majority of Americans support affirmative action for women, while views on minority groups were more split. Men are only slightly more likely to support affirmative action for women, though a majority of both do. However, a slight majority of Americans do believe that affirmative action goes beyond ensuring access and goes into the realm of preferential treatment. More recently, a Quinnipiac poll from June 2009 finds that 55% of Americans feel that affirmative action, in general, should be discontinued, though 55% support it for people with disabilities. A Gallup poll from 2005 showed that 72% of black Americans and 44% of white Americans supported racial affirmative action (with 21% and 49% opposing), with support and opposition among Hispanic people falling between those of black people and white people. Support among black people, unlike among white people, had almost no correlation with political affiliation.

A 2009 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute survey found 65% of American voters opposed the application of affirmative action to homosexuals, with 27% indicating they supported it.

A Leger poll taken in 2010 found 59% of Canadians opposed considering race, gender, or ethnicity when hiring for government jobs.

A 2014 Pew Research Center poll found that 63% of Americans thought affirmative action programs aimed at increasing minority representation on college campuses were &quot;a good thing&quot;, compared to 30% who thought they were &quot;a bad thing&quot;. The following year, Gallup released a poll showing that 67% of Americans supported affirmative action programs aimed at increasing female representation, compared to 58% who supported such programs aimed at increasing the representation of racial minorities.

A 2019 Pew Research Center poll found 73% of Americans believe race or ethnicity should not factor into college admissions decisions. A few years later in 2022, a Pew Research Center poll found that 74% of Americans believe race or ethnicity should not factor into college admissions decisions.
