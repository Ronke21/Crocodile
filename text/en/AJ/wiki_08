<text>The Elvish languages of Middle-earth, constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien, include Quenya and Sindarin. These were the various languages spoken by the Elves of Middle-earth as they developed as a society throughout the Ages. In his pursuit for realism and in his love of language, Tolkien was especially fascinated with the development and evolution of language through time. Tolkien created two almost fully developed languages and a dozen more in various beginning stages as he studied and reproduced the way that language adapts and morphs. A philologist by profession, he spent much time on his constructed languages. In the collection of letters he had written, posthumously published by his son, Christopher Tolkien, he stated that he began stories set within this secondary world, the realm of Middle-earth, not with the characters or narrative as one would assume, but with a created set of languages. The stories and characters serve as conduits to make those languages come to life. Inventing language was always a crucial piece to Tolkien&#x27;s mythology and world building. As Tolkien stated:

Tolkien created scripts for his Elvish languages, of which the best known are Sarati, Tengwar, and Cirth.

== External history ==

=== Language construction ===

J. R. R. Tolkien began to construct his first &quot;Elvin tongue&quot; c. 1910–1911 while he was at the King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham and which he later named &quot;Quenya&quot; (c. 1915). At that time, Tolkien was already familiar with Latin, Greek, Italian, Spanish, and three ancient Germanic languages: Gothic, Old Norse, and Old English. He had invented several cryptographic codes such as Animalic, and two or three constructed languages including Naffarin. He then discovered Finnish, which he described many years later as &quot;like discovering a complete wine-cellar filled with bottles of an amazing wine of a kind and flavour never tasted before. It quite intoxicated me.&quot; 

Tolkien with his Quenya pursued a double aesthetic goal: &quot;classical and inflected&quot;. This urge, in fact, was the motivation for his creation of a &#x27;mythology&#x27;. While the language developed, he needed speakers, history for the speakers and all real dynamics, like war and migration: &quot;It was primarily linguistic in inspiration and was begun in order to provide the necessary background of &#x27;history&#x27; for Elvish tongues&quot;.

The Elvish languages underwent countless revisions in grammar, mostly in conjugation and the pronominal system. The Elven vocabulary was not subject to sudden or extreme change; except during the first conceptual stage c. 1910–c. 1920. Tolkien sometimes changed the &quot;meaning&quot; of an Elvish word, but he almost never disregarded it once invented, and he kept on refining its meaning, and countlessly forged new synonyms. Moreover, Elven etymology was in a constant flux. Tolkien delighted in inventing new etymons for his Elvish vocabulary.

From the outset, Tolkien used comparative philology and the tree model as his major tools in his constructed languages. He usually started with the phonological system of the proto-language and then proceeded in inventing for each daughter language the many mechanisms of sound change needed.

Tolkien stated that he intentionally designed Sindarin to be in relation to Quenya as medieval Welsh is to Latin. Nelson Goering analysed this claim, finding it broadly reasonable, if the relationships are allowed to be of different kinds.

In the early 30s Tolkien decided that the proto-language of the Elves was Valarin, the tongue of the gods or Valar: &quot;The language of the Elves derived in the beginning from the Valar, but they change it even in the learning, and moreover modified and enriched it constantly at all times by their own invention.&quot; In his &quot;Comparative Tables&quot;, Tolkien describes the mechanisms of sound change in the following daughter languages: &quot;Qenya, Lindarin&quot; (a dialect of Qenya), &quot;Telerin, Old Noldorin&quot; (or &quot;Fëanorian&quot;), &quot;Noldorin&quot; (or &quot;Gondolinian&quot;), &quot;Ilkorin&quot; (esp. of Doriath), &quot;Danian of Ossiriand, East Danian, Taliska, West Lemberin, North Lemberin, and East Lemberin&quot;.

In his lifetime J.R.R. Tolkien never ceased to experiment on his constructed languages, and they were subjected to many revisions. They had many grammars with substantial differences between different stages of development. After the publication of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1954–1955), the grammar rules of his major Elvish languages Quenya, Telerin and Sindarin went through very few changes (this is late Elvish 1954–1973).

=== Publication of Tolkien&#x27;s linguistic papers ===

:: &quot;The linguistic papers published in &quot;Vinyar Tengwar&quot; and &quot;Parma Eldalamberon&quot; are listed in the Bibliography of this article.&quot;

Two magazines (&quot;Vinyar Tengwar&quot;, from its issue 39 in July 1998, and &quot;Parma Eldalamberon&quot;, from its issue 11 in 1995) are exclusively devoted to the editing and publishing of J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s gigantic mass of previously unpublished linguistic papers, including those omitted by Christopher Tolkien from &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot;.

== Internal history ==

=== At the time of the &quot;Lhammas&quot; and &quot;The Etymologies&quot;, 1937 ===

The Elvish languages are a family of several related languages and dialects. In 1937, Tolkien drafted the &quot;Lhammas&quot; and &quot;The Etymologies&quot;, both edited and published in the 1987 &quot;The Lost Road and Other Writings&quot;. They depict a tree of languages analogous to that of the Indo-European languages that Tolkien knew as a philologist.

This was internally consistent, but for one thing. Central to the story was the history of the Noldor. Their language, Noldorin, evolved very slowly in the changeless atmosphere of Valinor. Tolkien had developed its linguistics in some detail. With their return to Beleriand, the language was evidently sharply distinct from Qenya, implying rapid change. As Tolkien worked on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, starting soon after &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was published in 1937, the matter troubled him. He came up with a radical solution: the Noldor adopted the local language, Sindarin, as spoken by the Sindar or Grey-Elves, when they settled in Beleriand. That allowed Noldorin to be, more plausibly, a scarcely-altered dialect of Quenya; and it freed up his linguistically-developed material to be rebadged as Sindarin, which would have had a long time to evolve in Middle-earth. This was to some extent an awkward solution, as Sindarin had quite different origins, and could have developed rather differently. Tolkien reshaped his &quot;Tree of Tongues&quot; accordingly.

&quot;The Etymologies&quot; is Tolkien&#x27;s etymological dictionary of the Elvish languages, contemporaneous with the . It is a list of roots of the Proto-Elvish language, from which he built his many Elvish languages, especially Quenya, Noldorin and Ilkorin. &quot;The Etymologies&quot;, never meant to be published, does not form a unified whole, but incorporates layer upon layer of changes. In his introduction to &quot;The Etymologies&quot;, Christopher Tolkien wrote that his father was &quot;more interested in the processes of change than he was in displaying the structure and use of the languages at any given time.&quot;

=== With &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; ===

The story of the Elvish languages as conceived by Tolkien from when he began working on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is that they all originated from Primitive Quendian or Quenderin, the proto-language of all the Elves who awoke together in the far east of Middle-earth, Cuiviénen, and began &quot;naturally&quot; to make a language. With the sundering of the Elves, all the Elvish languages are presumed to be descendants of this common ancestor, including the two languages that Tolkien developed most fully, Quenya and Sindarin, as shown in the tree diagram. 

In detail, Tolkien invented two subfamilies (subgroups) of the Elvish languages. &quot;The language of the Quendelie (Elves) was thus very early sundered into the branches Eldarin and Avarin&quot;. These further subdivided as follows:

* Avarin is the language of various Elves of the Second and Third Clans, who refused to come to Valinor. It developed into at least six Avarin languages.
* Common Eldarin is the language of the three clans of the Eldar during the Great March to Valinor. It developed into:
** Quenya, the language of the Elves in Valinor (Eldamar) beyond the Sea; it divided into:
*** Vanyarin Quenya or Quendya, colloquial speech of the Vanyar, the Elves of the First Clan;
*** Noldorin Quenya (and later Exilic Quenya, when the Noldor moved from Valinor to Beleriand), colloquial speech of the Noldor, the Elves of the Second Clan.
** Common Telerin, the early language of all the Teleri
*** Telerin, the language of the Teleri, Elves of the Third Clan, living in Tol Eressëa and Alqualondë in Valinor.
*** Nandorin, the language of the Nandor, a branch of the Third Clan. It developed into various Nandorin and Silvan languages.
*** Sindarin is the language of the Sindar, a branch of the Third Clan, who dwelt in Beleriand. Its dialects include Doriathrin, in Doriath; Falathrin, in the Falas of Beleriand; North Sindarin, in Dorthonion and Hithlum; Noldorin Sindarin, spoken by the Exiled Noldor.

=== Fictional philology ===

A tradition of philological study of Elvish languages exists within the fiction of Tolkien&#x27;s frame stories: 

Elven philologists are called the &quot;Lambengolmor&quot;; in Quenya, &quot;lambe&quot; means &quot;spoken language&quot; or &quot;verbal communication.&quot; Known members of the Lambengolmor were Rúmil, who invented the first Elvish script (the Sarati), Fëanor who later enhanced and further developed this script into his Tengwar, which later was spread to Middle-earth by the Exiled Noldor and remained in use ever after, and Pengolodh, who is credited with many works, including the &quot;Osanwe-kenta&quot; and the &quot;Lhammas&quot; or &quot;The &#x27;Account of Tongues&#x27; which Pengolodh of Gondolin wrote in later days in Tol-eressëa&quot;.

== Elvish scripts ==

Tolkien wrote out most samples of Elvish languages with the Latin alphabet, but within the fiction he imagined many writing systems for his Elves. The best-known are the &quot;Tengwar of Fëanor&quot;, but the first system he created, c. 1919, is the &quot;Tengwar of Rúmil&quot;, also called the sarati. In chronological order, Tolkien&#x27;s scripts are:

# Tengwar of Rúmil or Sarati
# Gondolinic runes (Runes used in the city of Gondolin)
# Valmaric script
# Andyoqenya
# Qenyatic
# Tengwar of Fëanor
# The Cirth of Daeron

<text>The Carabinieri (, , ; formally Arma dei Carabinieri, &quot;Arm of Carabineers&quot;; previously &quot;Corpo dei Carabinieri Reali&quot;, &quot;Royal Carabineers Corps&quot;) are the national gendarmerie of Italy who primarily carry out domestic and foreign policing duties. It is one of Italy&#x27;s main law enforcement agencies, alongside the Polizia di Stato and the Guardia di Finanza. As with the Guardia di Finanza but in contrast to the Polizia di Stato, the Carabinieri are a military force. As the fourth branch of the Italian Armed Forces, they come under the authority of the Ministry of Defence; for activities related to inland public order and security, they functionally depend on the Ministry of the Interior. In practice, there is a significant overlap between the jurisdiction of the Polizia di Stato and Carabinieri, although both of them are contactable through 112, the European Union&#x27;s Single Emergency number. Unlike the Polizia di Stato, the Carabinieri have responsibility for policing the military, and a number of members regularly participate in military missions abroad.

They were originally founded as the police force of the Kingdom of Sardinia, the forerunner of the Kingdom of Italy. During the process of Italian unification, the Carabinieri were appointed as the &quot;First Force&quot; of the new national military organization. Although the Carabinieri assisted in the suppression of opposition during the rule of Benito Mussolini, they were also responsible for his downfall and many units were disbanded during World War II by Nazi Germany, which resulted in large numbers of Carabinieri joining the Italian resistance movement.

In 2000, they were separated from the Army to become a separate branch of the Italian Armed Forces. Carabinieri have policing powers that can be exercised at any time and in any part of the country, and they are always permitted to carry their assigned weapon as personal equipment (Beretta 92FS pistols).

The Carabinieri are often referred to as &quot;La Benemerita&quot; (The Reputable or The Meritorious) as they are a trusted and prestigious law enforcement institution in Italy. The first official account of the use of this term to refer to the Carabinieri dates back to 24 June 1864.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Inspired by the French gendarmerie, the corps was created by King Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia with the aim of providing the Savoyard state of the Kingdom of Sardinia with a police corps. After French soldiers had occupied Turin at the end of the 18th century and later abandoned it to the Kingdom of Sardinia, the Royal Carabinieri Corps was instituted under the Royal Patents of 13 July 1814. The name is derived from the French word &quot;carabinier&quot;, meaning &quot;soldier armed with a carbine.&quot;

The new force was divided into divisions on the scale of one division for each province. The divisions were further divided into companies and subdivided into lieutenancies, which commanded and coordinated the local police stations and were distributed throughout the national territory in direct contact with the public.

In 1868, the Cuirassiers Regiment or &quot;Corazzieri&quot; was formed, initially as a cavalry escort of honour for the sovereign, and since 1946 for the President of the Republic. The Italian unification saw the number of divisions increased, and on 24 January 1861, the &quot;Carabinieri&quot; were appointed the &quot;First Force&quot; of the new national military organization.

In May 1915, Italian troops marched to encompass South Tyrol, a territory of their former allies Austria-Hungary, in the Italian front . The defenders had sufficient time to prepare strong fortifications there, and at the Karst Plateau to the east. The Italians, under the overall command of General Luigi Cadorna, found themselves repeatedly repulsed in harsh fighting. The role of the Carabinieri was to act as barrier troops, setting up machine gun posts to control the rear of the attacking regiments and prevent desertion.

=== 1930s and 1940s ===
During Fascist Italy (1922–1943) under Benito Mussolini, the Carabinieri were one of the police forces entrusted with suppressing opposition in Italy. During the same period, while part of the Italian African Police (mainly in the late 1930s), they were involved in atrocities in colonial Italian East Africa during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. During World War II, they fought in their function as military police against the Allied forces, and against Yugoslav Partisans as part of the Italian occupation force of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

After the fall of the Fascist regime in Italy on 25 July 1943, on the orders of the king, Mussolini was arrested by the Carabinieri as he left the king&#x27;s private residence in Rome and subsequently imprisoned on Campo Imperatore by Carabinieri forces. After the armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces on 3 September 1943 and the country&#x27;s split into the fascist Italian Social Republic in the north and the Kingdom of Italy in the south, the Carabinieri split into two groups.

In the Kingdom of Italy, the Carabinieri Command for Liberated Italy was founded in Bari, mobilizing new units for the Italian war of liberation. These units were attached to the Italian Liberation Corps and the six Italian Combat Groups of the Italian Co-Belligerent Army, fighting with the Allied forces.

In the fascist Social Republic in the North, the regime organized the National Republican Guard (composed of Carabinieri, former officers from the Italian African Police, Guardia di Finanza and customs police), to employ it as a military police and rapid-deployment anti-guerrilla force. GNR was later joined (but not taken over) by the Black Brigades, which represented a new militant incarnation of the Fascist party.

Due to the role the Carabinieri had played in the downfall of Mussolini, and since one of the few units which fought the German occupation of Rome were the Granatieri di Sardegna Mechanized Brigade regiments and the II Carabinieri cadet battalion, the Germans did not view the Carabinieri as loyal to the fascist cause. They disarmed the force and began the deportation of 8,000 officers to Germany for forced labour on 6 October 1943; the Italian Colonial Police took over their jobs.

Subsequently, large numbers of Carabinieri joined the Italian resistance movement to fight German and Italian fascists. Nonetheless, some 45,000 officers remained on the job and as of March 1944, this group was the only national security force in Italy.

After the war the Carabinieri counted at least 2735 fallen and 6500 wounded, out of approximately 14,000 who had joined the Resistance in northern and central Italy. In Yugoslavia, the Carabinieri formed a battalion of the Italian 182nd Armored Infantry Regiment &quot;Garibaldi&quot;, which fought alongside the Yugoslav partisans against the Wehrmacht and the Croatian Ustaše. The battalion lost over 80% of its members in combat and was awarded the Silver Medal of Military Valor to commemorate the fallen.

One notable act of heroism in this era came from Vice Brigadiere Salvo D&#x27;Acquisto, who was executed by Nazi Germany in Palidoro (near Rome) during World War II. D&#x27;Acquisto exchanged his life for the lives of citizens due to be executed in retaliation for the killing of a German soldier; instead, he claimed responsibility and was executed for the offence.

=== Present day ===

The Carabinieri were in the forefront of many internal conflicts in Italy in the late 20th century, such as the Years of Lead (against the Red Brigades) and the Second Mafia War (against the Corleonesi Mafia). They participated, and lost men, in events such as the Peteano massacre in 1972, Circonvallazione massacre in 1982, and the murder of Emanuele Basile. Until 2000, the Carabinieri were part of the Italian Army. On 31 March 2000, they were separated to become the fourth branch of the Italian Armed Forces. Interpol summarizes this force (part of the Ministry of Defence) as having a &quot;nationwide remit for crime investigations. It also serves as the military police for the Italian armed forces and can be called upon for national defence action.&quot;

According to Europol (the EU&#x27;s law enforcement agency), the Carabinieri Corps&#x27; military duties include &quot;contributing to national defence, participating in military operations in Italy and abroad, executing military police functions and ensuring the security of Italian diplomatic and consular representations&quot;. As a national police force, it &quot;carries out public order and security policing, as well as investigative activities on its own initiative or at the request of the judicial authorities&quot;. Europol also states that the force is &quot;supplemented by the Specialized Carabinieri Commands, responsible for safeguarding the primary interests of the community: from the protection of the environment, health, work and national cultural heritage, to the observance of community and agri-food regulations, to the suppression of forgery [of] currency&quot;.
In recent years Carabinieri units have been dispatched on peacekeeping missions, including Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. In 2003, 12 Carabinieri were killed in a suicide bombing on their base in Nasiriyah, near Basra in southern Iraq, in the largest Italian military loss of life in a single action since the Second World War. One of the previous projects included training and assisting the Afghan National Security Forces, the Afghan National Police, and the Afghan National Civil Order Police. In Iraq, Carabinieri have trained 13,000 police officers; during the ISIS destruction of historic sites, Italy dispatched troops from the Carabinieri&#x27;s Command to protect cultural heritage.

At the Sea Island Conference of the G8 in 2004, Carabinieri were given a mandate to establish a Centre of Excellence for Stability Police Units to spearhead the development of training and doctrinal standards for civilian police units attached to international peacekeeping missions.

The State Forestry Corps was dissolved on 31 December 2016 and personnel with forestry police function were militarized and absorbed by the Carabinieri.

== Organization ==
The corps is headed by the &#x27;, consisting of the &quot;Comandante Generale&quot; (a General), the &#x27; (a Lieutenant General) and the Chief of Staff, all located in Rome. The Chief of Staff directs, coordinates and supervises all activities of the force. It directly supervises the Directors of Administration, Health, Engineering, the motor pool and the Veterinary Commission. On the Deputy Chiefs of Staff depend the National Center for Recruitment and Selection, the Administration National Center and the Legislation Office.

=== Territorial Organization ===
The Carabinieri are organised on a territorial basis for law-enforcement missions. The territorial organization represents the core of the institution; it contains 80 percent of the force and is organized hierarchically in five inter-regional commands, 19 regional commands and 102 provincial commands, 504 Company Commands and
4,672 Station Commands and lieutenancies.

The territorial organization includes four heliborne units:

* Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron &quot;Cacciatori di Calabria&quot;, responsible for operations in Calabria
* Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron &quot;Cacciatori di Sicilia&quot;, responsible for operations in Sicily
* Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron &quot;Cacciatori di Sardegna&quot;, responsible for operations in Sardinia
* Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron &quot;Cacciatori di Puglia&quot;, responsible for operations in Apulia

=== Specialist and Mobile Units Command Organization ===

Outside the territorial organisation, the Specialist and Mobile Units Command &quot;Palidoro&quot; (, based in Rome) controls the Carabinieri Mobile Units Division, the Carabinieri Specialist Units Division and the ROS.

==== Carabinieri Specialist Units Division ====

The Carabinieri Specialist Units Division is the Carabinieri formation, established in 2001, dedicated to the performance of specialist police activities and the support to the Territorial Organizations. The Division directs, controls, and coordinates its own units, which carry out tasks related to the protection of Italian artistic heritage, to the currency protection, to the protection of Italian embassies abroad, to the health protection, to the labour policing, to Bank of Italy needs, to the Carabinieri forensics police services. In addition, the Division provides Carabinieri air support.

==== Mobile Units Division ====
The Carabinieri Mobile Units Division is located in Rome and has two brigades tasked with mass manoeuvres during emergencies, defending the nation and participating in military operations abroad. It supports public order and territorial control in urban areas, and contributes to the operations of civil authorities in terms of public safety. 1st Mobile Brigade, whose headquarters is located in Rome and includes six Regiments and four Battalions mainly employed in public order tasks. 2nd Mobile Brigade headquartered in Livorno includes the Gruppo di Intervento Speciale special forces group, the 1st Paratroopers Carabinieri Regiment &quot;Tuscania&quot;, and the 7th &quot;Trentino-Alto Adige&quot; and 13th &quot;Friuli-Venezia Giulia&quot; regiments, which, together with the Multinational Specialized Unit, are mainly engaged in international missions.

==== Special forces ====

The Gruppo di Intervento Speciale in one of the six Italian special forces.

==== ROS ====
The ROS (&quot;Raggruppamento Operativo Speciale&quot; or Special Operational Group) is an elite unit founded in 1990 to deal with organised crime (Mafia and others), subversive activities, terrorism and more complex types of crime. An anti-crime section is found in every city and district public prosecutor&#x27;s office.

==== Special Tasks Departments ====

Special Tasks Departments are outside the ordinary organisational framework and are used for special missions:
&quot;Corazzieri&quot; (Cuirassiers) are an elite corps and honour guard of the President of the Italian Republic, located in the Quirinal Palace. They are distinguished by their uniforms and height (the minimum height for admission is ). They have almost no other everyday duties, although they may be seen patrolling occasionally. 

Other departments are in service to constitutional bodies such as, the Presidency of the Republic, the Senate, Parliament, the Judiciary, the prime minister and the National Council of Economy and Labour. Carabinieri also perform military police and security duties for the Ministry of Defence, military high commands, the offices of the military judiciary and allied military organisations in Italy and abroad. They also have personnel attached to the Department of Public Security in various departments, as well as anti-Mafia and anti-drug investigative task forces. &quot;Carabinieri&quot; officers are charged with surveillance and security at Italian embassies and consulates abroad, performing the same services entrusted to the Marine Corps Embassy Security Group in United States diplomatic and consular offices.

Together with the Polizia di Stato and the Guardia di Finanza, the Carabinieri is also responsible for border control.

==== Command Unit for environmental, agri-food and forestry protection ====
The specialized &quot;Comando unità per la tutela forestale, ambientale, e agroalimentare&quot; has its headquarters in Rome, and 15 regional commands and approximately 700 Station Commands around the country, with 7,000 personnel. Its missions are preventing production and distribution of illicit agri-foodstuffs, environmental and biodiversity protection, prevention of poaching, and suppression of all criminal organizations that, with their activity, affect the environment. In the Unit, there are also 29 NOEs (&quot;Nucleo Operativo Ecologico&quot;), teams highly specialized in complex investigations in environmental matters against organized crime.

== War service ==

The main battles in which the Carabinieri took part before World War I are:

* Grenoble, July 5, 1815
* Battle of Pastrengo, 30 April 1848 – the Carabinieri Corps was awarded its first Silver Medal of Military Valor
* Battle of Santa Lucia, 6 May 1848 – the Carabinieri Corps was awarded its first Bronze Medal of Military Valor
* Battle of Custoza, 24–25 July 1848
* Battle of Custoza, 24 June 1866

For its contributions during the First World War, the Corps was awarded its first Gold Medal of Military Valor

In World War II, Carabinieri fought in the following battles:
* Battle of Klisoura on the Greek-Albanian front from 16 to 30 December 1940 Bronze Medal of Military Valor
* Battle at Cafe Struga on the Albanian-Yugoslav front on 18 April 1941
* Battle of Culqualber (Ethiopia), 6 August-21 November 1941 – Corps was awarded its second Gold Medal of Military Valor

From 1943 to 1945, the Carabinieri were accountable to the Control Commission of the Allied Military Government (AMGOT). Their reorganization and reform was organized by Colonel Arthur Young, a British police officer seconded as Director of Public Safety and Director of Security.

== Uniforms ==

The Carabinieri, as a military and police force, have various uniforms for different functions. For each type of uniform there are seasonal variants and (except for service, combat and historical) versions for men and women. How, when and why they are to be worn is dictated by the &quot;&quot;R-11 &quot;Regulation on Uniforms for the Carabinieri Arma&quot;&quot; published by the Carabinieri General Command in 1988.

The uniforms of the Carabinieri are divided into: 
# historical and full dress
# ordinary,
# service,
# representative, (for warrant officers, NCOs and constables) 
# Great Winter Uniform (GUI) / Great Summer Uniform (GUE) (for officers) 
# operational use
# athletic gear

Those of service, representation and GUI/GUE are a derivation of the ordinary.

===History===
Originally, the Carabinieri were issued a distinctive uniform in black with silver braid around the collar and cuffs, edges trimmed in scarlet and epaulettes in silver. The mounted division had white fringes, and the infantry had light blue. Their headgear was a distinctive bicorne, popularly called the &quot;lucerna&quot; (in use only for historical uniform and ceremonies).
They still use a version of the historic uniform today for ceremonies.

===Design===
The uniform that the Gendarmerie wore in 1814 consisted of a turquoise fabric buttoned suit with a blue collar and padded gloves. Since 1822, some small changes have been made to the uniform. Officials and Marshals had silver swords and sabres, both in a black leather scabbard. At the beginning of the 20th Century, the rules of the dress code were reinforced because of World War I.

Troopers had three different types of uniforms: the &quot;Complete uniform&quot;, the &quot;Ordinary uniform&quot;, and the &quot;Effort uniform&quot;. The Carabinieri&#x27;s uniform at that time was made of a green-grey cloth material, and was used by all soldiers.

===Historical and Ceremonial (Special) uniform===

For historical and ceremonial use, the Carabinieri uniform consists of a distinctive black uniform made of silver braids around the collar and cuffs, edges trimmed in scarlet and epaulettes in silver. The fringes of the mounted division are white, and the infantry has light blue. The headgear used is the traditional two-pointed hat for Carabinieri, known as the Lucerna, also called a bicorne.

During the 1980s Giorgio Armani designed the new more modern uniforms.

===Ordinary uniform===
The modern Carabinieri Force uniform is coloured in black for every seasonal version, with small variations on weather basis (coat or wind jacket), and is composed of:

*a four-button jacket with shoulder pads: all buttons on the uniform are silvered
*a shirt underneath in white, with two pockets
*trousers have a classic cut, with four pockets and has two vertical red stripes along the outer side of both legs, stretching from the hips to the ankles
*flat black shoes are worn.

The uniform is accompanied by accessories such as:

*the black tie, 
*the white cross-belt, or Sam Browne or no belt, 
*peaked cap (males), bowler cap (females) 
*black leather gloves,
*V-neck sweater
*wind-breaker
*waterproof coat

There are differences for season, duties, rank and location. For instance, in the summer the four-button jacket and white shirt and tie are replaced with a short-sleeved blue shirt.

Depending on the weather conditions, the uniform can be worn with a waterproof coat (or beaver cloth for officers) and an anorak. Inside the military installations, the jacket can be removed or replaced with the &quot;V-neck&quot; sweater.

In 2020 new &#x27;bomber-style jackets&#x27;, with appropriate logos were introduced which can be worn instead of the four-button jacket. The white cross belt is still worn on top and either a roll-neck base layer or a white shirt and tie is worn underneath.

Accessories are the same, although &quot;Wanted in Rome&quot; reported that: &quot;The old leather holster will also be retired, replaced by an external belt with a quick-release holster, made of plastic material. The old gloves will be replaced with modern, cut-resistant gloves. However, style has not been sacrificed for function, begging the question, are the Carabinieri of Rome the most stylish police force in the world?&quot; 

====Headdress====
The regulation peaked cap is rigid with a &quot;frieze&quot; of the Carabinieri (metallic for pinned, Carabinieri and students, embroidered in silver fabric for NCOs, gilded for the inspectors and officers while for the generals the frieze is the eagle of the staff with RI monogram in the centre, silver for brigade and division generals, gold for corps generals). The commanding officers of the department wear the frieze embroidered in gold-edged with red.

The official emblem is placed at the center of the cap.

Each cap is black and has a wimple held by two rounded buttons, the wimple is black for carabinieri, pinned, brigadiers and students; for the chief brigadiers the wimple is also black but with the addition of a silver galloncino mottled with black. The wimple becomes silver mottled with black in the center from the rank of marshal to that of chief marshal with the number of chevrons increasing as the rank increases. For the major marshals, the wimple is silver edged in red with three silver gallons flecked with black; for the top rank of non-commissioned officers, i.e. the lieutenant, the wiggle is silver edged in red with four silver braids edged in red.

For the lower officers, the wiggle and the braids are entirely in silver without streaks, for the superior officers, the wiggle becomes a double braided cord always silver with silver braids. Finally, for the general officers, the wimple becomes a silver braid with silver braids.

Other forms of headdress include berets and mountain-style caps. Carabinieri MP Units also wear a dark navy blue beret.

===Service uniform===

The service uniform is essentially the same as the ordinary uniform but is adapted for the specific duty of the soldier.
E.g.:
*mountainous areas – ski patrol; ski kit is worn, 
*mounted (horseback) patrol; different boots are worn, 
*&#x27;radio-mobile&#x27; (car) patrol; different boots and a &#x27;paletta&#x27; (stop sign used to stop vehicles) are worn, etc.

===Representative (dress) uniform===
&quot;(For carabinieri, NCOs, warrant officers, officers.)&quot;

The representative uniform is essentially the same as the ordinary uniform, but worn for more formal, but still on duty occasions, where the ordinary and ceremonial uniforms are unsuitable. It differs from the ordinary uniform for the following elements:

*white cords (agiluettes) on the four-button jacket, 
*sabre (sword) with pendants and dragon, 
*black belt with shoulder strap (only marshals and chief brigadiers) or white cross-belt/bandolier (for the remaining staff).
*white gloves
*and a black-cape in colder conditions

Sometimes the pistol is worn with the sword, other times it is not. The cap worn is the peaked cap.

===Operational uniform===
The operational uniform is worn for public order (riot) situations, raids, cross-country work and is worn for operations only.
It is blue in color with red piping and a &#x27;Polychrome&#x27; uniform.

It consists of:

*jacket (with four patch pockets, shoulder straps fastened by a button and thermal lining) and trousers; 
*blue fleece suit (to be used as an alternative to the sweater); 
*blue neckerchief with red piping; 
*black leather gloves with reinforcement; 
*operational black amphibious ankle boots
*and a dark-blue beret with cap badge

A &quot;particular&quot; version of this uniform is worn by the soldiers of the Special Intervention Group, as well as the following departments: The &quot;Tuscania&quot; CC Parachute Regiment, Carabinieri Regiment on Horseback and Airborne Squadrons CC Cacciatori. The colours (for the trousers and jacket) are often camouflage rather than blue and red and maroon/red (for the beret) rather than blue.

Riot helmets, body-armour, equipment vests, rescue helmets etc., are worn when necessary.

===Gymnastic===
It consists of a tracksuit (jacket and pants), t-shirt and shorts.

The suit consists of a jacket and long trousers in blue fabric, with red inserts. The jacket is made up of a body with a central zip, two detachable sleeves with a zip and a collar.
The trousers consist of two leggings, an elastic waistband with a drawstring at the waist and a zip at the bottom. The jacket, the T-shirt and the shorts bear the &quot;frieze&quot; of the Carabinieri.

===Other===
There are also evening-dress style (mess kit) uniforms for dinners and galas, as well as variations for the above uniform for occasions (e.g. medals, sabres to be worn etc.).

&quot;The full set of different Carabinieri uniforms today is presented here (in Italian).&quot;

====Females====

The uniforms adopted for female staff are essentially an adaptation of the male ones.

The variants concern the buttoning, the shape of the jackets (without upper pockets), the use of skirts inside the Offices, off-duty or with formal uniforms and shoes.

No changes were made to any other items of clothing/equipment already in use by male personnel.

== Weapons ==

== Vehicles and equipment ==

Until very recently the Italian police (including the &quot;Carabinieri&quot;) operated only Italian-made vehicles, but that changed with the introduction of Land Rover Defenders and Subarus into service. Normal &quot;Carabinieri&quot; patrol vehicles are dark blue with a white roof, with a red stripe along the side. Carabinieri license plates begin with &quot;CC&quot; or previously with &quot;EI&quot; (formerly Esercito Italiano, Italian Army), and a Carabinieri car is traditionally called a &quot;Gazzella&quot; (gazelle). Small or medium-sized cars are used for ordinary patrol work, with larger and more powerful vehicles being used for emergency response, highway patrol, and special services. The vehicles of the &quot;Carabinieri&quot; military police and mobile units are painted in NATO camouflage scheme as done with the other Italian Armed Forces vehicles.

<doc id="45177" wikidata="Q743364" url="?curid=45177" title="Negative binomial distribution">
<text>In probability theory and statistics, the negative binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of failures in a sequence of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials before a specified/constant/fixed number of successes formula_1 occur. For example, we can define rolling a 6 on some dice as a success, and rolling any other number as a failure, and ask how many failure rolls will occur before we see the third success (formula_2). In such a case, the probability distribution of the number of failures that appear will be a negative binomial distribution.

An alternative formulation is to model the number of total trials (instead of the number of failures). In fact, for a specified (non-random) number of successes (&quot;r&quot;), the number of failures (&quot;n&quot; − &quot;r&quot;) is random because the number of total trials (&quot;n&quot;) is random. For example, we could use the negative binomial distribution to model the number of days &quot;n&quot; (random) a certain machine works (specified by &quot;r&quot;) before it breaks down.

The Pascal distribution (after Blaise Pascal) and Polya distribution (for George Pólya) are special cases of the negative binomial distribution. A convention among engineers, climatologists, and others is to use &quot;negative binomial&quot; or &quot;Pascal&quot; for the case of an integer-valued stopping-time parameter (formula_1) and use &quot;Polya&quot; for the real-valued case.

For occurrences of associated discrete events, like tornado outbreaks, the Polya distributions can be used to give more accurate models than the Poisson distribution by allowing the mean and variance to be different, unlike the Poisson. The negative binomial distribution has a variance formula_4, with the distribution becoming identical to Poisson in the limit formula_5 for a given mean formula_6 (i.e. when the failures are increasingly rare). This can make the distribution a useful overdispersed alternative to the Poisson distribution, for example for a robust modification of Poisson regression. In epidemiology, it has been used to model disease transmission for infectious diseases where the likely number of onward infections may vary considerably from individual to individual and from setting to setting. More generally, it may be appropriate where events have positively correlated occurrences causing a larger variance than if the occurrences were independent, due to a positive covariance term.

The term &quot;negative binomial&quot; is likely due to the fact that a certain binomial coefficient that appears in the formula for the probability mass function of the distribution can be written more simply with negative numbers.

==Definitions==

Imagine a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials: each trial has two potential outcomes called &quot;success&quot; and &quot;failure.&quot; In each trial the probability of success is formula_7 and of failure is formula_8. We observe this sequence until a predefined number formula_1 of successes occurs. Then the random number of observed failures, formula_10, follows the negative binomial (or Pascal) distribution:
: formula_11

===Probability mass function===

The probability mass function of the negative binomial distribution is
:formula_12

where &quot;r&quot; is the number of successes, &quot;k&quot; is the number of failures, and &quot;p&quot; is the probability of success on each trial.

Here, the quantity in parentheses is the binomial coefficient, and is equal to
:formula_13
Note that &quot;Γ(r)&quot; is the Gamma function.

There are &quot;k&quot; failures chosen from &quot;k&quot; + &quot;r&quot; − 1 trials rather than &quot;k&quot; + &quot;r&quot; because the last of the &quot;k&quot; + &quot;r&quot; trials is by definition a success.

This quantity can alternatively be written in the following manner, explaining the name &quot;negative binomial&quot;:

:formula_14

Note that by the last expression and the binomial series, for every and formula_15,

:formula_16

hence the terms of the probability mass function indeed add up to one as below.
:formula_17

To understand the above definition of the probability mass function, note that the probability for every specific sequence of &quot;r&quot; successes and &quot;k&quot; failures is , because the outcomes of the &quot;k&quot; + &quot;r&quot; trials are supposed to happen independently. Since the &quot;r&quot;th success always comes last, it remains to choose the &quot;k&quot; trials with failures out of the remaining &quot;k&quot; + &quot;r&quot; − 1 trials. The above binomial coefficient, due to its combinatorial interpretation, gives precisely the number of all these sequences of length &quot;k&quot; + &quot;r&quot; − 1.

===Cumulative distribution function===

The cumulative distribution function can be expressed in terms of the regularized incomplete beta function:
: formula_18
(This formula is using the same parameterization as in the article&#x27;s table, with &quot;r&quot; the number of successes, and formula_19 with formula_6 the mean.)

It can also be expressed in terms of the cumulative distribution function of the binomial distribution:
: formula_21

===Alternative formulations===
Some sources may define the negative binomial distribution slightly differently from the primary one here. The most common variations are where the random variable &quot;X&quot; is counting different things. These variations can be seen in the table here:

Each of the four definitions of the negative binomial distribution can be expressed in slightly different but equivalent ways. The first alternative formulation is simply an equivalent form of the binomial coefficient, that is: formula_22. The second alternate formulation somewhat simplifies the expression by recognizing that the total number of trials is simply the number of successes and failures, that is: formula_23. These second formulations may be more intuitive to understand, however they are perhaps less practical as they have more terms.
* The definition where &quot;X&quot; is the number of &quot;n&quot; trials that occur for a given number of &quot;r&quot; successes is similar to the primary definition, except that the number of trials is given instead of the number of failures. This adds &quot;r&quot; to the value of the random variable, shifting its support and mean. 
* The definition where &quot;X&quot; is the number of &quot;k&quot; successes (or &quot;n&quot; trials) that occur for a given number of &quot;r&quot; failures is similar to the primary definition used in this article, except that numbers of failures and successes are switched when considering what is being counted and what is given. Note however, that &quot;p&quot; still refers to the probability of &quot;success&quot;.
* The definition of the negative binomial distribution can be extended to the case where the parameter &quot;r&quot; can take on a positive real value. Although it is impossible to visualize a non-integer number of &quot;failures&quot;, we can still formally define the distribution through its probability mass function. The problem of extending the definition to real-valued (positive) &quot;r&quot; boils down to extending the binomial coefficient to its real-valued counterpart, based on the gamma function:
:: formula_24
: After substituting this expression in the original definition, we say that &quot;X&quot; has a negative binomial (or Pólya) distribution if it has a probability mass function:
:: formula_25
: Here &quot;r&quot; is a real, positive number.

In negative binomial regression, the distribution is specified in terms of its mean, formula_26, which is then related to explanatory variables as in linear regression or other generalized linear models. From the expression for the mean &quot;m&quot;, one can derive formula_27 and formula_28. Then, substituting these expressions in the one for the probability mass function when &quot;r&quot; is real-valued, yields this parametrization of the probability mass function in terms of &quot;m&quot;:

:formula_29
The variance can then be written as formula_30. Some authors prefer to set formula_31, and express the variance as formula_32. In this context, and depending on the author, either the parameter &quot;r&quot; or its reciprocal &quot;α&quot; is referred to as the &quot;dispersion parameter&quot;, &quot;shape parameter&quot; or &quot;clustering coefficient&quot;, or the &quot;heterogeneity&quot; or &quot;aggregation&quot; parameter. The term &quot;aggregation&quot; is particularly used in ecology when describing counts of individual organisms. Decrease of the aggregation parameter &quot;r&quot; towards zero corresponds to increasing aggregation of the organisms; increase of &quot;r&quot; towards infinity corresponds to absence of aggregation, as can be described by Poisson regression.

===Alternative parameterizations===
Sometimes the distribution is parameterized in terms of its mean &quot;μ&quot; and variance &quot;σ&quot;2:
:: formula_33

Another popular parameterization uses &quot;r&quot; and the failure odds &quot;β&quot;:
::formula_34

===Examples===

====Length of hospital stay====
Hospital length of stay is an example of real-world data that can be modelled well with a negative binomial distribution via negative binomial regression.

====Selling candy====
Pat Collis is required to sell candy bars to raise money for the 6th grade field trip. Pat is (somewhat harshly) not supposed to return home until five candy bars have been sold. So the child goes door to door, selling candy bars. At each house, there is a 0.6 probability of selling one candy bar and a 0.4 probability of selling nothing.

&quot;What&#x27;s the probability of selling the last candy bar at the&quot; &quot;n&quot;th &quot;house?&quot;

Successfully selling candy enough times is what defines our stopping criterion (as opposed to failing to sell it), so &quot;k&quot; in this case represents the number of failures and &quot;r&quot; represents the number of successes. Recall that the distribution describes the probability of &quot;k&quot; failures and &quot;r&quot; successes in &quot;k&quot; + &quot;r&quot; Bernoulli(&quot;p&quot;) trials with success on the last trial. Selling five candy bars means getting five successes. The number of trials (i.e. houses) this takes is therefore &quot;k&quot; + 5 = &quot;n&quot;. The random variable we are interested in is the number of houses, so we substitute &quot;k&quot; = &quot;n&quot; − 5 into a mass function and obtain the following mass function of the distribution of houses (for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 5):

:formula_35

&quot;What&#x27;s the probability that Pat finishes on the tenth house?&quot;

:formula_36

&quot;What&#x27;s the probability that Pat finishes on or before reaching the eighth house?&quot;

To finish on or before the eighth house, Pat must finish at the fifth, sixth, seventh, or eighth house. Sum those probabilities:
:formula_37
:formula_38
:formula_39
:formula_40
:formula_41

&quot;What&#x27;s the probability that Pat exhausts all 30 houses that happen to stand in the neighborhood?&quot;

This can be expressed as the probability that Pat does not finish on the fifth through the thirtieth house:
:formula_42

Because of the rather high probability that Pat will sell to each house (60 percent), the probability of her &quot;not&quot; fulfilling her quest is vanishingly slim.

==Properties==

===Expectation===

The expected total number of trials needed to see &quot;r&quot; successes is formula_43. Thus, the expected number of &quot;failures&quot; would be this value, minus the successes:
:formula_44

===Expectation of successes===

The expected total number of failures in a negative binomial distribution with parameters is &quot;r&quot;(1 − &quot;p&quot;)/&quot;p&quot;. To see this, imagine an experiment simulating the negative binomial is performed many times. That is, a set of trials is performed until successes are obtained, then another set of trials, and then another etc. Write down the number of trials performed in each experiment: and set . Now we would expect about successes in total. Say the experiment was performed times. Then there are successes in total. So we would expect , so . See that is just the average number of trials per experiment. That is what we mean by &quot;expectation&quot;. The average number of failures per experiment is . This agrees with the mean given in the box on the right-hand side of this page.

A rigorous derivation can be done by representing the negative binomial distribution as the sum of waiting times. Let formula_45 with the convention formula_10 represents the number of failures observed before formula_1 successes with the probability of success being formula_7. And let formula_49 where formula_50 represents the number of failures before seeing a success. We can think of formula_50 as the waiting time (number of failures) between the formula_52th and formula_53th success. Thus
:formula_54
The mean is 
:formula_55
which follows from the fact formula_56.

=== Variance ===
When counting the number of failures before the &quot;r&quot;-th success, the variance is &quot;r&quot;(1 − &quot;p&quot;)/&quot;p&quot;2. 
When counting the number of successes before the &quot;r&quot;-th failure, as in alternative formulation (3) above, the variance is &quot;rp&quot;/(1 − &quot;p&quot;)2.

===Relation to the binomial theorem===

Suppose &quot;Y&quot; is a random variable with a binomial distribution with parameters &quot;n&quot; and &quot;p&quot;. Assume &quot;p&quot; + &quot;q&quot; = 1, with &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot; ≥ 0, then

:formula_57

Using Newton&#x27;s binomial theorem, this can equally be written as:

:formula_58

in which the upper bound of summation is infinite. In this case, the binomial coefficient

: formula_59

is defined when &quot;n&quot; is a real number, instead of just a positive integer. But in our case of the binomial distribution it is zero when &quot;k&quot; &gt; &quot;n&quot;. We can then say, for example

: formula_60

Now suppose &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0 and we use a negative exponent:

:formula_61

Then all of the terms are positive, and the term

:formula_62

is just the probability that the number of failures before the &quot;r&quot;th success is equal to &quot;k&quot;, provided &quot;r&quot; is an integer. (If &quot;r&quot; is a negative non-integer, so that the exponent is a positive non-integer, then some of the terms in the sum above are negative, so we do not have a probability distribution on the set of all nonnegative integers.)

Now we also allow non-integer values of &quot;r&quot;. Then we have a proper negative binomial distribution, which is a generalization of the Pascal distribution, which coincides with the Pascal distribution when &quot;r&quot; happens to be a positive integer.

Recall from above that

:The sum of independent negative-binomially distributed random variables &quot;r&quot;1 and &quot;r&quot;2 with the same value for parameter &quot;p&quot; is negative-binomially distributed with the same &quot;p&quot; but with &quot;r&quot;-value &quot;r&quot;1 + &quot;r&quot;2.

This property persists when the definition is thus generalized, and affords a quick way to see that the negative binomial distribution is infinitely divisible.

=== Recurrence relations ===

The following recurrence relations hold:

==Related distributions==
* The geometric distribution (on { 0, 1, 2, 3, ... }) is a special case of the negative binomial distribution, with
::formula_67

* The negative binomial distribution is a special case of the discrete phase-type distribution.
* The negative binomial distribution is a special case of discrete compound Poisson distribution.

===Poisson distribution===
Consider a sequence of negative binomial random variables where the stopping parameter &quot;r&quot; goes to infinity, while the probability &quot;p&quot; of success in each trial goes to one, in such a way as to keep the mean of the distribution (i.e. the expected number of failures) constant. Denoting this mean as &quot;λ&quot;, the parameter &quot;p&quot; will be &quot;p&quot; = &quot;r&quot;/(&quot;r&quot; + &quot;λ&quot;)
: formula_68

Under this parametrization the probability mass function will be
: formula_69

Now if we consider the limit as &quot;r&quot; → ∞, the second factor will converge to one, and the third to the exponent function:
: formula_70
which is the mass function of a Poisson-distributed random variable with expected value &quot;λ&quot;.

In other words, the alternatively parameterized negative binomial distribution converges to the Poisson distribution and &quot;r&quot; controls the deviation from the Poisson. This makes the negative binomial distribution suitable as a robust alternative to the Poisson, which approaches the Poisson for large &quot;r&quot;, but which has larger variance than the Poisson for small &quot;r&quot;.
: formula_71

===Gamma–Poisson mixture===
The negative binomial distribution also arises as a continuous mixture of Poisson distributions (i.e. a compound probability distribution) where the mixing distribution of the Poisson rate is a gamma distribution. That is, we can view the negative binomial as a distribution, where &quot;λ&quot; is itself a random variable, distributed as a gamma distribution with shape &quot;r&quot; and scale &quot;θ&quot; = or correspondingly rate &quot;β&quot; =.

To display the intuition behind this statement, consider two independent Poisson processes, &quot;Success&quot; and &quot;Failure&quot;, with intensities &quot;p&quot; and 1 − &quot;p&quot;. Together, the Success and Failure processes are equivalent to a single Poisson process of intensity 1, where an occurrence of the process is a success if a corresponding independent coin toss comes up heads with probability &quot;p&quot;; otherwise, it is a failure. If &quot;r&quot; is a counting number, the coin tosses show that the count of successes before the &quot;r&quot;th failure follows a negative binomial distribution with parameters &quot;r&quot; and &quot;p&quot;. The count is also, however, the count of the Success Poisson process at the random time &quot;T&quot; of the &quot;r&quot;th occurrence in the Failure Poisson process. The Success count follows a Poisson distribution with mean &quot;pT&quot;, where &quot;T&quot; is the waiting time for &quot;r&quot; occurrences in a Poisson process of intensity 1 − &quot;p&quot;, i.e., &quot;T&quot; is gamma-distributed with shape parameter &quot;r&quot; and intensity 1 − &quot;p&quot;. Thus, the negative binomial distribution is equivalent to a Poisson distribution with mean &quot;pT&quot;, where the random variate &quot;T&quot; is gamma-distributed with shape parameter &quot;r&quot; and intensity . The preceding paragraph follows, because &quot;λ&quot; = &quot;pT&quot; is gamma-distributed with shape parameter &quot;r&quot; and intensity .

The following formal derivation (which does not depend on &quot;r&quot; being a counting number) confirms the intuition.

: formula_72

Because of this, the negative binomial distribution is also known as the gamma–Poisson (mixture) distribution. The negative binomial distribution was originally derived as a limiting case of the gamma-Poisson distribution.

===Distribution of a sum of geometrically distributed random variables===

If &quot;Y&quot;&quot;r&quot; is a random variable following the negative binomial distribution with parameters &quot;r&quot; and &quot;p&quot;, and support {0, 1, 2, ...}, then &quot;Y&quot;&quot;r&quot; is a sum of &quot;r&quot; independent variables following the geometric distribution (on {0, 1, 2, ...}) with parameter &quot;p&quot;. As a result of the central limit theorem, &quot;Y&quot;&quot;r&quot; (properly scaled and shifted) is therefore approximately normal for sufficiently large &quot;r&quot;.

Furthermore, if &quot;B&quot;&quot;s&quot;+&quot;r&quot; is a random variable following the binomial distribution with parameters &quot;s&quot; + &quot;r&quot; and &quot;p&quot;, then

: formula_73

In this sense, the negative binomial distribution is the &quot;inverse&quot; of the binomial distribution.

The sum of independent negative-binomially distributed random variables &quot;r&quot;1 and &quot;r&quot;2 with the same value for parameter &quot;p&quot; is negative-binomially distributed with the same &quot;p&quot; but with &quot;r&quot;-value &quot;r&quot;1 + &quot;r&quot;2.

The negative binomial distribution is infinitely divisible, i.e., if &quot;Y&quot; has a negative binomial distribution, then for any positive integer &quot;n&quot;, there exist independent identically distributed random variables &quot;Y&quot;1, ..., &quot;Y&quot;&quot;n&quot; whose sum has the same distribution that &quot;Y&quot; has.

===Representation as compound Poisson distribution===
The negative binomial distribution can be represented as a compound Poisson distribution: Let formula_74 denote a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, each one having the logarithmic series distribution Log(&quot;p&quot;), with probability mass function

: formula_75

Let &quot;N&quot; be a random variable, independent of the sequence, and suppose that &quot;N&quot; has a Poisson distribution with mean . Then the random sum

: formula_76

is -distributed. To prove this, we calculate the probability generating function &quot;GX&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, which is the composition of the probability generating functions &quot;GN&quot; and &quot;G&quot;&quot;Y&quot;1. Using

:formula_77

and

: formula_78

we obtain

: formula_79

which is the probability generating function of the distribution.

The following table describes four distributions related to the number of successes in a sequence of draws:
===(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,0) class of distributions===

The negative binomial, along with the Poisson and binomial distributions, is a member of the (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,0) class of distributions. All three of these distributions are special cases of the Panjer distribution. They are also members of a natural exponential family.

==Statistical inference==

===Parameter estimation===

====MVUE for &quot;p&quot;====

Suppose &quot;p&quot; is unknown and an experiment is conducted where it is decided ahead of time that sampling will continue until &quot;r&quot; successes are found. A sufficient statistic for the experiment is &quot;k&quot;, the number of failures.

In estimating &quot;p&quot;, the minimum variance unbiased estimator is

: formula_80

====Maximum likelihood estimation====

When &quot;r&quot; is known, the maximum likelihood estimate of &quot;p&quot; is

: formula_81

but this is a biased estimate. Its inverse (&quot;r&quot; + &quot;k&quot;)/&quot;r&quot;, is an unbiased estimate of 1/&quot;p&quot;, however.

When &quot;r&quot; is unknown, the maximum likelihood estimator for &quot;p&quot; and &quot;r&quot; together only exists for samples for which the sample variance is larger than the sample mean. The likelihood function for &quot;N&quot; iid observations (&quot;k&quot;1, ..., &quot;k&quot;&quot;N&quot;) is

:formula_82

from which we calculate the log-likelihood function

:formula_83

To find the maximum we take the partial derivatives with respect to &quot;r&quot; and &quot;p&quot; and set them equal to zero:

:formula_84 and

:formula_85

where

: formula_86 is the digamma function.

Solving the first equation for &quot;p&quot; gives:

:formula_87

Substituting this in the second equation gives:

:formula_88

This equation cannot be solved for &quot;r&quot; in closed form. If a numerical solution is desired, an iterative technique such as Newton&#x27;s method can be used. Alternatively, the expectation–maximization algorithm can be used.

==Occurrence and applications==

===Waiting time in a Bernoulli process===

For the special case where &quot;r&quot; is an integer, the negative binomial distribution is known as the Pascal distribution. It is the probability distribution of a certain number of failures and successes in a series of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials. For &quot;k&quot; + &quot;r&quot; Bernoulli trials with success probability &quot;p&quot;, the negative binomial gives the probability of &quot;k&quot; successes and &quot;r&quot; failures, with a failure on the last trial. In other words, the negative binomial distribution is the probability distribution of the number of successes before the &quot;r&quot;th failure in a Bernoulli process, with probability &quot;p&quot; of successes on each trial. A Bernoulli process is a discrete time process, and so the number of trials, failures, and successes are integers.

Consider the following example. Suppose we repeatedly throw a die, and consider a 1 to be a failure. The probability of success on each trial is 5/6. The number of successes before the third failure belongs to the infinite set { 0, 1, 2, 3, ... }. That number of successes is a negative-binomially distributed random variable.

When &quot;r&quot; = 1 we get the probability distribution of number of successes before the first failure (i.e. the probability of the first failure occurring on the (&quot;k&quot; + 1)st trial), which is a geometric distribution:
: formula_89

===Overdispersed Poisson===

The negative binomial distribution, especially in its alternative parameterization described above, can be used as an alternative to the Poisson distribution. It is especially useful for discrete data over an unbounded positive range whose sample variance exceeds the sample mean. In such cases, the observations are overdispersed with respect to a Poisson distribution, for which the mean is equal to the variance. Hence a Poisson distribution is not an appropriate model. Since the negative binomial distribution has one more parameter than the Poisson, the second parameter can be used to adjust the variance independently of the mean. See Cumulants of some discrete probability distributions.

An application of this is to annual counts of tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic or to monthly to 6-monthly counts of wintertime extratropical cyclones over Europe, for which the variance is greater than the mean. In the case of modest overdispersion, this may produce substantially similar results to an overdispersed Poisson distribution.

Negative binomial modeling is widely employed in ecology and biodiversity research for analyzing count data where overdispersion is very common. This is because overdispersion is indicative of biological aggregation, such as species or communities forming clusters. Ignoring overdispersion can lead to significantly inflated model parameters, resulting in misleading statistical inferences. The negative binomial distribution effectively addresses overdispersed counts by permitting the variance to vary quadratically with the mean. An additional dispersion parameter governs the slope of the quadratic term, determining the severity of overdispersion. The model&#x27;s quadratic mean-variance relationship proves to be a realistic approach for handling overdispersion, as supported by empirical evidence from many studies. Overall, the NB model offers two attractive features: (1) the convenient interpretation of the dispersion parameter as an index of clustering or aggregation, and (2) its tractable form, featuring a closed expression for the probability mass function.

In genetics, the negative binomial distribution is commonly used to model data in the form of discrete sequence read counts from high-throughput RNA and DNA sequencing experiments.

In epidemiology of infectious diseases, the negative binomial has been used as a better option than the Poisson distribution to model overdispersed counts of secondary infections from one infected case (super-spreading events).

===Multiplicity observations (physics)===

The negative binomial distribution has been the most effective statistical model for a broad range of multiplicity observations in particle collision experiments, e.g., formula_90 (See for an overview), and is argued to be a scale-invariant property of matter, providing the best fit for astronomical observations, where it predicts the number of galaxies in a region of space. The phenomenological justification for the effectiveness of the negative binomial distribution in these contexts remained unknown for fifty years, since their first observation in 1973. In 2023, a proof from first principles was eventually demonstrated by Scott V. Tezlaf, where it was shown that the negative binomial distribution emerges from symmetries in the dynamical equations of a canonical ensemble of particles in Minkowski space. Roughly, given an expected number of trials formula_91 and expected number of successes formula_92, where

: formula_93

an isomorphic set of equations can be identified with the parameters of a relativistic current density of a canonical ensemble of massive particles, via

: formula_94

where formula_95 is the rest density, formula_96 is the relativistic mean square density, formula_97 is the relativistic mean square current density, and formula_98, where formula_99 is the mean square speed of the particle ensemble and formula_100 is the speed of light—such that one can establish the following bijective map:

: formula_101

A rigorous alternative proof of the above correspondence has also been demonstrated through quantum mechanics via the Feynman path integral.

==History==

This distribution was first studied in 1713 by Pierre Remond de Montmort in his &quot;Essay d&#x27;analyse sur les jeux de hazard&quot;, as the distribution of the number of trials required in an experiment to obtain a given number of successes. It had previously been mentioned by Pascal.

<text>In computing, a process is the instance of a computer program that is being executed by one or many threads. There are many different process models, some of which are light weight, but almost all processes (even entire virtual machines) are rooted in an operating system (OS) process which comprises the program code, assigned system resources, physical and logical access permissions, and data structures to initiate, control and coordinate execution activity. Depending on the OS, a process may be made up of multiple threads of execution that execute instructions concurrently.

While a computer program is a passive collection of instructions typically stored in a file on disk, a process is the execution of those instructions after being loaded from the disk into memory. Several processes may be associated with the same program; for example, opening up several instances of the same program often results in more than one process being executed.

Multitasking is a method to allow multiple processes to share processors (CPUs) and other system resources. Each CPU (core) executes a single process at a time. However, multitasking allows each processor to switch between tasks that are being executed without having to wait for each task to finish (preemption). Depending on the operating system implementation, switches could be performed when tasks initiate and wait for completion of input/output operations, when a task voluntarily yields the CPU, on hardware interrupts, and when the operating system scheduler decides that a process has expired its fair share of CPU time (e.g, by the Completely Fair Scheduler of the Linux kernel).

A common form of multitasking is provided by CPU&#x27;s time-sharing that is a method for interleaving the execution of users&#x27; processes and threads, and even of independent kernel tasks – although the latter feature is feasible only in preemptive kernels such as Linux. Preemption has an important side effect for interactive processes that are given higher priority with respect to CPU bound processes, therefore users are immediately assigned computing resources at the simple pressing of a key or when moving a mouse. Furthermore, applications like video and music reproduction are given some kind of real-time priority, preempting any other lower priority process. In time-sharing systems, context switches are performed rapidly, which makes it seem like multiple processes are being executed simultaneously on the same processor. This seemingly-simultaneous execution of multiple processes is called concurrency.

For security and reliability, most modern operating systems prevent direct communication between independent processes, providing strictly mediated and controlled inter-process communication.

==Representation==
In general, a computer system process consists of (or is said to &quot;own&quot;) the following resources:
* An &quot;image&quot; of the executable machine code associated with a program.
* Memory (typically some region of virtual memory); which includes the executable code, process-specific data (input and output), a call stack (to keep track of active subroutines and/or other events), and a heap to hold intermediate computation data generated during run time.
* Operating system descriptors of resources that are allocated to the process, such as file descriptors (Unix terminology) or handles (Windows), and data sources and sinks.
* Security attributes, such as the process owner and the process&#x27; set of permissions (allowable operations).
* Processor state (context), such as the content of registers and physical memory addressing. The &quot;state&quot; is typically stored in computer registers when the process is executing, and in memory otherwise.

The operating system holds most of this information about active processes in data structures called process control blocks. Any subset of the resources, typically at least the processor state, may be associated with each of the process&#x27; threads in operating systems that support threads or &quot;child&quot; processes.

The operating system keeps its processes separate and allocates the resources they need, so that they are less likely to interfere with each other and cause system failures (e.g., deadlock or thrashing). The operating system may also provide mechanisms for inter-process communication to enable processes to interact in safe and predictable ways.

==Multitasking and process management==
A multitasking operating system may just switch between processes to give the appearance of many processes executing simultaneously (that is, in parallel), though in fact only one process can be executing at any one time on a single CPU (unless the CPU has multiple cores, then multithreading or other similar technologies can be used).

It is usual to associate a single process with a main program, and child processes with any spin-off, parallel processes, which behave like asynchronous subroutines. A process is said to &quot;own&quot; resources, of which an &quot;image&quot; of its program (in memory) is one such resource. However, in multiprocessing systems &quot;many&quot; processes may run off of, or share, the same reentrant program at the same location in memory, but each process is said to own its own &quot;image&quot; of the program.

Processes are often called &quot;tasks&quot; in embedded operating systems. The sense of &quot;process&quot; (or task) is &quot;something that takes up time&quot;, as opposed to &quot;memory&quot;, which is &quot;something that takes up space&quot;.

The above description applies to both processes managed by an operating system, and processes as defined by process calculi.

If a process requests something for which it must wait, it will be blocked. When the process is in the blocked state, it is eligible for swapping to disk, but this is transparent in a virtual memory system, where regions of a process&#x27;s memory may be really on disk and not in main memory at any time. Even portions of active processes/tasks (executing programs) are eligible for swapping to disk, if the portions have not been used recently. Not all parts of an executing program and its data have to be in physical memory for the associated process to be active.

===Process states===

An operating system kernel that allows multitasking needs processes to have certain states. Names for these states are not standardised, but they have similar functionality.

* First, the process is &quot;created&quot; by being loaded from a secondary storage device (hard disk drive, CD-ROM, etc.) into main memory. After that the process scheduler assigns it the &quot;waiting&quot; state.
* While the process is &quot;waiting&quot;, it waits for the scheduler to do a so-called context switch. The context switch loads the process into the processor and changes the state to &quot;running&quot; while the previously &quot;running&quot; process is stored in a &quot;waiting&quot; state.
* If a process in the &quot;running&quot; state needs to wait for a resource (wait for user input or file to open, for example), it is assigned the &quot;blocked&quot; state. The process state is changed back to &quot;waiting&quot; when the process no longer needs to wait (in a blocked state).
* Once the process finishes execution, or is terminated by the operating system, it is no longer needed. The process is removed instantly or is moved to the &quot;terminated&quot; state. When removed, it just waits to be removed from main memory.

==Inter-process communication==
When processes need to communicate with each other they must share parts of their address spaces or use other forms of inter-process communication (IPC).
For instance in a shell pipeline, the output of the first process needs to pass to the second one, and so on. Another example is a task that has been decomposed into cooperating but partially independent processes which can run simultaneously (i.e., using concurrency, or true parallelism – the latter model is a particular case of concurrent execution and is feasible whenever multiple CPU cores are available for the processes that are ready to run).

It is even possible for two or more processes to be running on different machines that may run different operating system (OS), therefore some mechanisms for communication and synchronization (called communications protocols for distributed computing) are needed (e.g., the Message Passing Interface {MPI}).

==History==
By the early 1960s, computer control software had evolved from monitor control software, for example IBSYS, to executive control software. Over time, computers got faster while computer time was still neither cheap nor fully utilized; such an environment made multiprogramming possible and necessary. Multiprogramming means that several programs run concurrently. At first, more than one program ran on a single processor, as a result of underlying uniprocessor computer architecture, and they shared scarce and limited hardware resources; consequently, the concurrency was of a &quot;serial&quot; nature. On later systems with multiple processors, multiple programs may run concurrently in &quot;parallel&quot;.

Programs consist of sequences of instructions for processors. A single processor can run only one instruction at a time: it is impossible to run more programs at the same time. A program might need some resource, such as an input device, which has a large delay, or a program might start some slow operation, such as sending output to a printer. This would lead to processor being &quot;idle&quot; (unused). To keep the processor busy at all times, the execution of such a program is halted and the operating system switches the processor to run another program. To the user, it will appear that the programs run at the same time (hence the term &quot;parallel&quot;).

Shortly thereafter, the notion of a &quot;program&quot; was expanded to the notion of an &quot;executing program and its context&quot;. The concept of a process was born, which also became necessary with the invention of re-entrant code. Threads came somewhat later. However, with the advent of concepts such as time-sharing, computer networks, and multiple-CPU shared memory computers, the old &quot;multiprogramming&quot; gave way to true multitasking, multiprocessing and, later, multithreading.

<doc id="45181" wikidata="Q132232" url="?curid=45181" title="Clara Schumann">
<text>Clara Josephine Schumann (; ; née Wieck; 13 September 1819 – 20 May 1896) was a German pianist, composer, and piano teacher. Regarded as one of the most distinguished pianists of the Romantic era, she exerted her influence over the course of a 61-year concert career, changing the format and repertoire of the piano recital by lessening the importance of purely virtuosic works. She also composed solo piano pieces, a Piano Concerto, chamber music, choral pieces, and songs.

She grew up in Leipzig, where both her father Friedrich Wieck and her mother Mariane were pianists and piano teachers. In addition, her mother was a singer. Clara was a child prodigy, and was trained by her father. She began touring at age eleven, and was successful in Paris and Vienna, among other cities. She married the composer Robert Schumann, on 12 September 1840, and the couple had eight children. Together, they encouraged Johannes Brahms and maintained a close relationship with him. She gave the public premieres of many works by her husband and by Brahms.

After Robert Schumann&#x27;s early death, she continued her concert tours in Europe for decades, frequently with the violinist Joseph Joachim and other chamber musicians. Beginning in 1878, she was an influential piano educator at Dr. Hoch&#x27;s Konservatorium in Frankfurt, where she attracted international students. She edited the publication of her husband&#x27;s work. Schumann died in Frankfurt, but was buried in Bonn beside her husband.

Several films have focused on Schumann&#x27;s life, the earliest being &quot;Träumerei&quot; (&quot;Dreaming&quot;) of 1944. A 2008 film, &quot;Geliebte Clara&quot; (&quot;Beloved Clara&quot;), was directed by Helma Sanders-Brahms. An image of Clara Schumann from an 1835 lithograph by Andreas Staub was featured on the 100 Deutsche Mark banknote from 1989 to 2002. Interest in her compositions began to revive in the late 20th century, and her 2019 bicentenary prompted new books and exhibitions.

== Life ==
=== Early life ===
==== Family ====
Clara Josephine Wieck was born in Leipzig on 13 September 1819 to Friedrich Wieck and his wife Mariane (&quot;née&quot; Tromlitz). Her mother was a famous singer in Leipzig who performed weekly piano and soprano solos at the Gewandhaus. Clara&#x27;s parents had irreconcilable differences, in part due to her father&#x27;s unyielding nature. Prompted by an affair between her mother and Adolph Bargiel, her father&#x27;s friend, the Wiecks were divorced in 1825, with Mariane later marrying Bargiel. Five-year-old Clara remained with her father while Mariane and Bargiel eventually moved to Berlin, limiting contact between Clara and her mother to written letters and occasional visits.

==== Child prodigy ====
From an early age, Clara&#x27;s father planned her career and life down to the smallest detail. She started receiving basic piano instruction from her mother at the age of four. After her mother moved out, she began taking daily one-hour lessons from her father. They included subjects such as piano, violin, singing, theory, harmony, composition, and counterpoint. She then had to practice for two hours every day. Her father followed the methods in his own book, &quot;Wiecks pianistische Erziehung zum schönen Anschlag und zum singenden Ton&quot; (&quot;Wieck&#x27;s Piano Education for a Delicate Touch and a Singing Sound.&quot;) Her musical studies came largely at the expense of her broader general education, although she still studied religion and languages under her father&#x27;s control of the family.

Clara Wieck made her official debut on 28 October 1828 at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig, at age nine. The same year, she performed at the Leipzig home of Ernst Carus, director of the mental hospital at Colditz Castle. There, she met another gifted young pianist who had been invited to the musical evening, Robert Schumann, who was nine years older. Schumann admired Clara&#x27;s playing so much that he asked permission from his mother to stop studying law, which had never interested him much, and take music lessons with Clara&#x27;s father. While taking lessons, he rented a room in the Wieck household and stayed about a year.

From September 1831 to April 1832, Clara toured Paris and other European cities, accompanied by her father. In Weimar, she performed a bravura piece by Henri Herz for Goethe, who presented her with a medal with his portrait and a written note saying: &quot;For the gifted artist Clara Wieck&quot;. During that tour, the violinist Niccolò Paganini, who was also in Paris, offered to appear with her. Her Paris recital was poorly attended because many people had fled the city due to an outbreak of cholera. The tour marked her transition from a child prodigy to a young woman performer.

==== Success in Vienna ====
From December 1837 to April 1838, at the age of 18, Wieck performed a series of recitals in Vienna. Franz Grillparzer, Austria&#x27;s leading dramatic poet, wrote a poem entitled &quot;Clara Wieck and Beethoven&quot; after hearing her perform Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Appassionata&quot; sonata during one of these recitals. She performed to sell-out crowds and laudatory critical reviews; Benedict Randhartinger, a friend of Franz Schubert, gave her an autographed copy of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Erlkönig&quot;, inscribing it &quot;To the celebrated artist, Clara Wieck.&quot; Chopin described her playing to Franz Liszt, who came to hear one of Wieck&#x27;s concerts and subsequently praised her extravagantly in a letter that was published in the Parisian &quot;Revue et Gazette Musicale&quot; and later, in translation, in the Leipzig journal &quot;Neue Zeitschrift für Musik&quot;. On 15 March, she was named a &quot;Königliche und Kaiserliche Österreichische Kammer-virtuosin&quot; (&quot;Royal and Imperial Austrian Chamber Virtuoso&quot;), Austria&#x27;s highest musical honor.

An anonymous music critic, describing her Vienna recitals, said: &quot;The appearance of this artist can be regarded as epoch-making... In her creative hands, the most ordinary passage, the most routine motive acquires a significant meaning, a colour, which only those with the most consummate artistry can give.&quot;

=== Lasting relationships ===
==== Robert Schumann ====

Robert Schumann was a little more than nine years older than Wieck. In 1837, when she was 18, he proposed to her and she accepted. Robert then asked her father for her hand in marriage. Friedrich was strongly opposed to the marriage, and refused his permission. Robert and Clara decided to go to court and sue him. The judge allowed the marriage, which took place in Schönefeld church on 13 September 1840, the day before Clara&#x27;s 21st birthday, when she attained majority status. From then on, the couple maintained a joint musical and personal diary of their life together.

In February 1854, Robert Schumann had a mental collapse, attempted suicide, and was admitted, at his request, to a sanatorium in the village of Endenich near Bonn, where he stayed for the last two years of his life. In March 1854, Brahms, Joachim, Albert Dietrich, and Julius Otto Grimm spent time with Clara Schumann, playing music for her and with her to divert her mind from the tragedy. Brahms composed some private piano pieces for her to console her: four piano pieces and a set of variations on a theme by Robert Schumann that she had also written variations on a year earlier, as her Op. 20. The music by Brahms was not intended to be published, but for her alone. Brahms later thought to publish them anonymously, but eventually they were issued as his four Ballades, Op. 10, and &quot;Variations on a Theme by Robert Schumann&quot;, Op. 9. Brahms dedicated the variations to both Schumanns, hoping that Robert would be released soon and rejoined with his family.

For the entire two years of Robert Schumann&#x27;s stay at the institution, his wife was not permitted to visit him, while Brahms visited him regularly. When it was apparent that Robert was near death, she was finally admitted to see him. He appeared to recognize her, but could only speak a few words. Robert Schumann died two days later, on 29 July 1856.

==== Joseph Joachim ====
The Schumanns first met violinist Joseph Joachim in November 1844, when he was 14 years old. A year later, Clara Schumann wrote in her diary that in a concert on 11 November 1845, &quot;little Joachim was very much liked. He played a new violin concerto by Felix Mendelssohn, which is said to be wonderful.&quot; In May 1853, they heard Joachim play the solo part in Beethoven&#x27;s Violin Concerto. She wrote that he played &quot;with a finish, a depth of poetic feeling, his whole soul in every note, so ideally, that I have never heard violin-playing like it, and I can truly say that I have never received so indelible an impression from any virtuoso.&quot; A lasting friendship developed between Clara and Joseph, which for more than forty years never failed her in things great or small, never wavered in its loyalty.

Over her career, Schumann gave over 238 concerts with Joachim in Germany and Britain, more than with any other artist. The two were particularly noted for their playing of Beethoven&#x27;s violin sonatas.

==== Johannes Brahms ====
In early 1853, the then-unknown 20-year-old Johannes Brahms met Joachim and made a very favorable impression. Brahms received from him a letter of introduction to Robert Schumann, and thus presented himself at the Schumanns&#x27; home in Düsseldorf. Brahms played some of his piano solo compositions for the Schumanns, and they were deeply impressed. Robert published an article highly lauding Brahms, and Clara wrote in the diary that Brahms &quot;seemed as if sent straight from God&quot;.

During Robert Schumann&#x27;s last years, confined to an asylum, Brahms was a strong presence for the Schumann family. His letters indicate his strong feelings for Clara. Their relationship has been interpreted as somewhere between friendship and love, and Brahms always maintained the utmost respect for her, as a woman and a talented musician.

Brahms played his First Symphony for her before its premiere. She gave some advice about the Adagio, which he took to heart. She expressed her appreciation of the Symphony as a whole, but mentioned her dissatisfaction with the endings of the third and fourth movements. She was the first to perform many of his works in public, including the &quot;Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel&quot;, a solo piano work written by Brahms in 1861.

=== Concert tours ===
Clara Schumann first toured England in April 1856, while her husband was still living but unable to travel. She was invited to play in a London Philharmonic Society concert by conductor William Sterndale Bennett, a good friend of Robert&#x27;s. She was displeased with the little time spent on rehearsals: &quot;They call it a rehearsal here if a piece is played through once.&quot; She wrote that musical &quot;artists&quot; in England &quot;allow themselves to be treated as inferiors.&quot; She was happy, though, to hear the cellist Alfredo Piatti play with &quot;a tone, a bravura, a certainty, such as I never heard before&quot;. In May 1856, she played Robert Schumann&#x27;s Piano Concerto in A minor with the New Philharmonic Society conducted by Dr Wylde, who as she said had &quot;led a dreadful rehearsal&quot; and &quot;could not grasp the rhythm of the last movement&quot;. Still, she returned to London the following year and continued to perform in Britain for the next 15 years.

In October–November 1857, Schumann and Joachim went on a recital tour to Dresden and Leipzig. St. James&#x27;s Hall in London, which opened in 1858, hosted a series of &quot;Popular Concerts&quot; of chamber music. Joachim visited London annually beginning in 1866. Schumann also spent many years in London participating in the Popular Concerts with Joachim and the celebrated Italian cellist Carlo Alfredo Piatti. Second violinist Louis Ries (nephew of composer Ferdinand Ries) and violist J. B. Zerbini usually played on the same concert programs. George Bernard Shaw, the leading playwright and also a music critic, wrote that the Popular Concerts helped greatly to spread and enlighten musical taste in England.

In January 1867, Schumann toured Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland, along with Joachim, Piatti, Ries, and Zerbini. Two sisters, Louisa and Susanna Pyne, singers and managers of an opera company in England, and a man named Saunders, made all the arrangements. She was accompanied by her oldest daughter Marie, who wrote from Manchester to her friend Rosalie Leser that in Edinburgh the pianist &quot;was received with tempestuous applause and had to give an encore, so had Joachim. Piatti, too, is always tremendously liked.&quot; Marie also wrote: &quot;For the longer journeys we had a saloon [car], comfortably furnished with arm-chairs and sofas... the journey ... was very comfortable.&quot; On this occasion, the musicians were not &quot;treated as inferiors&quot;.

=== Later life ===
==== Concerts ====
Schumann still performed actively in the 1870s and 1880s. She performed extensively and regularly throughout Germany during these decades, and had engagements in Austria, Hungary, Belgium, Holland, and Switzerland. When in Basel, Switzerland, she often stayed with the Von der Mühll family. She continued her annual winter-spring concert tours of England, giving 16 of them between 1865 and 1888, often with violinist Joachim.

She took a break from concert performances, beginning in January 1874, cancelling her usual England tour due to an arm injury. In July, she consulted a doctor, who having massaged the arm, advised her to practice for only one hour a day. She rested for the remainder of the year before returning to the concert stage in March 1875. She had not fully recovered, and experienced more neuralgia in her arm again in May, reporting that she &quot;could not write on account of my arm&quot;. By October 1875, she had recovered enough to begin another tour in Germany.

In addition to solo piano recitals, chamber music, and accompanying singers, she continued to perform frequently with orchestras. In 1877, she performed Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Piano Concerto in Berlin, with Woldemar Bargiel conducting, her half-brother by her mother&#x27;s second marriage, and had tremendous success. In 1883, she performed Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Choral Fantasy&quot; with the newly-formed Berlin Philharmonic, and was enthusiastically celebrated, although she was playing with an injured hand in great pain, having fallen on a staircase the previous day. Later that year she played Beethoven&#x27;s Fourth Piano Concerto (with her own cadenzas) with Joachim conducting the same orchestra, again to great acclaim.

In 1885, Schumann once again joined Joachim conducting Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto in D minor, again playing her own cadenzas. The following day, she played her husband&#x27;s Piano Concerto with Bargiel conducting. &quot;I think I played fresher than ever&quot;, she wrote to Brahms, &quot;What I liked very much about the concert was that I was able to give Woldemar the direction of it, who had longed for such an opportunity for years.&quot;

She played her last public concert in Frankfurt on 12 March 1891. The last work she played was Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Variations on a Theme by Haydn&quot;, in a version for two pianos, with James Kwast.

==== Teaching ====
In 1878, Schumann was appointed the first piano teacher of the new Dr. Hoch&#x27;s Konservatorium in Frankfurt. She had chosen Frankfurt among offers from Stuttgart, Hannover, and Berlin, because the director, Joachim Raff, had accepted her conditions: she could not teach more than 1-1/2 hours per day, was free to teach at her home, and had four months of vacation and time off for short tours in winter. She demanded two assistants, with her daughters Marie and Eugenie in mind.

She was the only woman on the faculty. Her fame attracted students from abroad, including Britain and the United States. She trained only advanced pupils, mostly young women, while her two daughters gave lessons to beginners. Among her 68 known students who made a musical career were Natalia Janotha, Fanny Davies, Nanette Falk, Amina Goodwin, Carl Friedberg, Leonard Borwick, Ilona Eibenschütz, Adelina de Lara, Mary Wurm, Marie Olson and Jane Roeckel. The Konservatorium held events to celebrate her 50th year on stage in 1878 and her 60th career anniversary ten years later. She held the teaching post until 1892 and contributed greatly to the improvement of modern piano playing technique.

=== Death ===
Clara Schumann suffered a stroke on 26 March 1896, and died on 20 May at age 76. She was buried in Bonn at Alter Friedhof next to her husband, according to her own wish.

== Family life ==

Robert Schumann gave his wife a diary on their wedding day. His first entry indicates that it should act as an autobiography of the family&#x27;s personal lives, especially of the couple, and of their desires and accomplishments in the arts. It also functioned as a record of their artistic endeavors and growth. She fully accepted the arrangement of a shared diary, as evidenced by her many entries. It demonstrates her loyal love for her husband, with a desire to combine two lives into one artistically, although this life-long goal involved risks.

The couple remained joint partners in both family life and their careers. She premiered many of his works, from solo piano works to her own piano versions of his orchestral works.

She often took charge of finances and general household affairs. Part of her responsibility included earning money by giving concerts, though she continued to play throughout her life, not just for the income but because she was an artist by training and nature. The burden of family duties increased over time and narrowed her ability as an artist. As a flourishing composer&#x27;s wife, she was limited in her own explorations.

She was the main breadwinner for her family and the sole one after her husband was hospitalized and then died. She gave concerts and taught, and she did most of the work of organizing her own concert tours. She hired a housekeeper and a cook to keep house while she was away on her long tours.

Clara Schumann had eight children in 13 years:
* Marie (1841–1929)
* Elise (1843–1928)
* Julie (1845–1872)
* Emil (1846–1847)
* Ludwig (1848–1899)
* Ferdinand (1849–1891)
* Eugenie (1851–1938)
* Felix (1854–1879)

Her life was punctuated by tragedy. Her husband was permanently institutionalized after a mental collapse. Her eldest living son Ludwig suffered from mental illness like his father and, in her words, eventually had to be &quot;buried alive&quot; in an institution. She became deaf in later life, and she often needed a wheelchair. Not only did her husband predecease her, but so did four of their children. Their first son, Emil, died in 1847, aged only 1. Their daughter Julie died in 1872, leaving two small children aged only 2 and 7, then raised by their grandmother. In 1879, their son Felix died aged 24. In 1891, their son Ferdinand died at the age of 41, leaving his children to her care.

Their oldest child Marie was of great support and help to her mother, taking the position of household cook. Marie also dissuaded her mother from continuing to burn letters that she had received from Brahms which he had asked her to destroy. Another daughter, Eugenie, who had been too young when her father died to remember him, wrote a book, &quot;Erinnerungen&quot; (Memoirs), published in 1925, covering her parents and Brahms.

Schumann famously rescued her children from violence during the May Uprising in Dresden in 1849. On the evening of 3 May, Robert and Clara heard that the revolution against King Frederick Augustus II of Saxony for not accepting the &quot;constitution for a German Confederation&quot; had arrived in Dresden. Most family members left and hid in a &quot;neighbourhood security brigade&quot;, but on 7 May, she bravely walked back to Dresden to rescue her three children who had been left with a maid, defying a pack of armed men who confronted her, then walked back out of the city through the dangerous areas again.

== Music ==
=== Performance repertoire ===
During her lifetime, Schumann was an internationally renowned concert pianist. Over 1,300 concert programs from her performances throughout Europe between 1831 through 1889 have been preserved. She championed the works of her husband and other contemporaries such as Brahms, Chopin and Mendelssohn.

The Schumanns were admirers of Chopin, especially of his &quot;Variations on &quot;Là ci darem la mano&quot;&quot;, and she played the piece herself. When she was 14 and her future husband 23, he wrote to her:
In her early years, her repertoire, selected by her father, was showy and in the style common to the time, with works by Friedrich Kalkbrenner, Adolf von Henselt, Sigismond Thalberg, Henri Herz, Johann Peter Pixis, Carl Czerny and her own compositions. She turned to including compositions by Baroque composers such as Domenico Scarlatti and Johann Sebastian Bach, but performed especially contemporary music by Chopin, Mendelssohn and her husband, whose music did not attain popularity until the 1850s.

In 1835, she performed her Piano Concerto in A minor with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, conducted by Mendelssohn. On 4 December 1845, she premiered Robert Schumann&#x27;s Piano Concerto in Dresden. Following the advice of Brahms she performed Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto in C minor at the Hanoverian court and in Leipzig.

Along with Arabella Goddard she was one of the first woman pianists to perform Beethoven&#x27;s Hammerklavier Sonata in public, doing so on two occasions before 1856. Her busiest years as a performer were between 1856 and 1873, after her husband&#x27;s death. During this period, she experienced success as a performer in Britain, where her 1865 performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto in G major was met with enormous applause. As a chamber musician, she often gave concerts with violinist Joachim. In her later career, she frequently accompanied lieder singers in recitals.

=== Compositions ===

As part of the broad musical education given to her by her father, Clara Wieck learned to compose, and from childhood to middle age she produced a good body of work. Clara wrote that &quot;composing gives me great pleasure... there is nothing that surpasses the joy of creation, if only because through it one wins hours of self-forgetfulness, when one lives in a world of sound&quot;. Her Op. 1 was &quot;Quatre Polonaises pour le pianoforte&quot; composed in 1831, and Op. 5 &quot;4 Pièces caractéristiques&quot; in 1836, all piano pieces for her recitals. She wrote her Piano Concerto in A minor at age 14, with some help from her future husband. She planned a second piano concerto, but only a &quot;Konzertsatz&quot; in F minor from 1847 survived.

After her marriage, she turned to lieder and choral works. The couple wrote and published one joint composition in 1841, setting a cycle of poems by Friedrich Rückert called &quot;Liebesfrühling&quot; (&quot;Spring of Love&quot;) in &quot;Zwölf Lieder auf F. Rückerts Liebesfrühling&quot;, her Op. 12 and his Op. 37. Her chamber works include the Piano Trio in G minor, Op. 17 (1846) and Three Romances for Violin and Piano, Op. 22 (1853), inspired by her husband&#x27;s birthday. They were dedicated to Joachim, who performed them for George V of Hanover, who declared them a &quot;marvellous, heavenly pleasure&quot;.

As she grew older, she became more preoccupied with other responsibilities in life and found it hard to compose regularly, writing, &quot;I once believed that I possessed creative talent, but I have given up this idea; a woman must not desire to compose – there has never yet been one able to do it. Should I expect to be the one?&quot; Her husband also expressed concern about the effect on her composing output:

She produced one to eight compositions every year beginning at age 11, until her output stopped in 1848, producing only a choral work that year for her husband&#x27;s birthday and leaving her second piano concerto unfinished. These two works, while reserved for her opus 18 and 19, were never published. Five years later, however, when she was 34 in 1853, the year she met Brahms, she engaged in a flurry of composing, resulting in 16 pieces that year: a set of piano variations on an &quot;Album Leaf&quot; of her husband (his Op. 99 No. 4), eight &quot;Romances&quot; for piano solo and for violin and piano, and seven songs. These works were published a year later, after Robert&#x27;s confinement, as her Op. 20 through 23.

For the next 43 years of her life, she only composed piano transcriptions of works by her husband and Brahms, including 41 transcriptions of Robert Schumann&#x27;s lieder (commissioned by a publisher in 1872), and a short piano duet commissioned for a friend&#x27;s wedding anniversary in 1879. In the last year of her life, she left several sketches for piano preludes, designed for piano students, as well as some published cadenzas for her performances of Beethoven and Mozart piano concertos.

Most of Clara Schumann&#x27;s music was never played by anyone else and largely forgotten until a resurgence of interest in the 1970s. Today her compositions are increasingly performed and recorded.

=== Editor ===
Schumann was the authoritative editor, aided by Brahms and others, of her husband&#x27;s works for the publishing firm of Breitkopf &amp; Härtel. She also edited 20 sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti, letters (&quot;Jugendbriefe&quot;) by her husband in 1885, and his piano works with fingering and other instructions (&quot;Fingersatz und Vortragsbezeichnungen&quot;) in 1886.

=== &quot;War of the Romantics&quot; ===
In the early 1840s the Schumanns were interested in the works of Franz Liszt and his young composer friends of what eventually became known as the New German School, but in the second half of the decade they both became openly hostile toward Liszt because of their more musically conservative outlook and beliefs, Clara more so than Robert, as she had long been the more conservative aesthete in the Schumann marriage. By the mid-1850s, after Robert&#x27;s decline, the young Brahms had joined the cause, and to promote her ideals and protect what she saw as an attack on her husband&#x27;s beliefs, she, Brahms, and Joseph Joachim formed a group of conservative musicians who defended Robert Schumann&#x27;s critical ideals of the legacy and respectability of music, the pinnacle of which had been Beethoven.

The opposing side of this &quot;War of the Romantics&quot;, a group of radical progressives in music (most of them from Weimar) led by Liszt and Richard Wagner, desired to escape composing under the shadow of Beethoven, but to transcend the old forms and ideas of what music had been and instead create what music &quot;should&quot; be for the future. The Weimar school promoted the idea of &quot;program music&quot;, while both the Schumanns and Brahms of the Leipzig/Berlin school were strict in their stance that music must and can only be &quot;absolute music&quot;, a term derisively coined by Wagner.

One of Clara Schumann&#x27;s difficulties with Liszt stemmed from a philosophical difference in performance practice. He believed that the artist, through physical and emotional performance, interpreted music for the audience. When he performed, Liszt flailed his arms, tossed his head, and pursed his lips, inspiring a Lisztomania across Europe which has been compared to the Beatlemania of female fans of The Beatles over a century later. Clara, in contrast, came to believe that the personality of the musician should be suppressed so that the composer&#x27;s vision would be clearly evident to listeners.

Partisans led active campaigns with public demonstrations at concerts, writings published in the press denigrating reputations, and other public slights designed to embarrass their adversaries. Brahms published a manifesto for the &quot;Serious Music&quot; side on 4 May 1861, signed by Clara Schumann, Joachim, Albert Dietrich, Woldemar Bargiel, and twenty others, which decried the purveyors of the &quot;Music of the Future&quot; as &quot;contrary to the innermost spirit of music, strongly to be deplored and condemned&quot;. The &quot;New Weimar Club&quot;, a formal society with Liszt at its center, held an anniversary celebration of the &quot;Neue Zeitschrift für Musik&quot;, the magazine Robert Schumann had founded, in his birthplace Zwickau, and conspicuously neglected to invite members of the opposing party, including his widow, Clara. Clara Schumann ceased to perform any of Liszt&#x27;s works, and she suppressed her husband&#x27;s dedication to Liszt of his &quot;Fantasie in C major&quot; when she published his complete works. When she heard that Liszt and Richard Wagner would be participating in a Beethoven centenary festival in Vienna in 1870, she refused to attend.

In describing the works of the opposing school, Clara Schumann was particularly scathing of Wagner, writing of his &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, that he &quot;wears himself out in atrocities&quot;, describing &quot;Lohengrin&quot; as &quot;horrible&quot;, and referring to &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; as &quot;the most repugnant thing I have ever seen or heard in all my life&quot;. She also complained that Wagner had spoken of her husband, Mendelssohn, and Brahms in a &quot;scornful&quot; way. Wagner had poked fun at the musical conservatives in an essay, portraying them as &quot;a musical temperance society&quot; awaiting a Messiah. She held Anton Bruckner&#x27;s Seventh Symphony in very low esteem and wrote to Brahms, describing it as &quot;a horrible piece&quot;. Bruckner&#x27;s symphonies were seen as representative of the New Music due to their advanced harmony, massive orchestration and extended time-scale. Schumann was more impressed, however, with the early First Symphony in F minor by Richard Strauss; this was before Strauss began composing the highly programmatic music for which he later became famous.

Brahms secretly held Wagner&#x27;s music in high esteem, and eventually publicly praised Liszt&#x27;s works as well. Several of the proponents and signers of the manifesto, including Joachim, relented and joined the &quot;other side&quot;. The controversy eventually died down, but Clara Schumann remained steadfast in her disapproval of the New German School&#x27;s music.

== Legacy ==
=== Impact during her lifetime ===
Although Schumann was not widely recognized as a composer for many years after her death, she had a lasting effect as a pianist. Trained by her father to play by ear and memorize, she gave public performances from memory as early as age thirteen, a fact noted as exceptional by her reviewers. She was one of the first pianists to perform from memory, making it the standard for concerts. She was also instrumental in changing the kind of program expected of concert pianists. In her early career, before her marriage, she played the customary bravura pieces designed to showcase the artist&#x27;s technique, often in the form of arrangements or variations on popular themes from operas, written by virtuosos such as Thalberg, Herz, or Henselt. As it was customary to play one&#x27;s own compositions, she included at least one of her own works in every program, such as Variations on a Theme by Bellini (Op. 8) and the popular Scherzo (Op. 10). However, as she became a more independent artist, her repertoire contained mainly music by leading composers.

Schumann influenced pianists through her teaching, which emphasized expression and a singing tone, with technique subordinated to the intentions of the composer. One of her students, Mathilde Verne, carried her teaching to England where she taught, among others, Solomon. Another of her students, Carl Friedberg, carried the tradition to the Juilliard School in America, where his students included Nina Simone, Malcolm Frager, and Bruce Hungerford.

She was also instrumental in getting the works of Robert Schumann recognized, appreciated and added to the repertoire. She promoted his works tirelessly throughout her life.

=== Film ===

Clara Schumann has been portrayed on screen many times. &quot;Träumerei&quot; (&quot;Dreaming&quot;), the oldest known Schumann film, premiered on 3 May 1944 in Zwickau. Possibly the best-known film is &quot;Song of Love (1947)&quot; starring Katharine Hepburn as Clara, Paul Henreid as Robert, and Robert Walker as Brahms.

In 1954, Loretta Young portrayed her on &quot;The Loretta Young Show&quot; in Season 1, Episode 26: &quot;The Clara Schumann Story&quot; (first aired on 21 March 1954), in which she supports the composing career of her husband, played by George Nader, alongside Shelley Fabares and Carleton G. Young.

Two more recent German films are &quot;Frühlingssinfonie&quot; (&quot;Spring Symphony&quot;) (1983), starring Nastassja Kinski as Clara, and the 2008 Helma Sanders-Brahms&#x27; film &quot;Geliebte Clara&quot; (&quot;Beloved Clara&quot;), where she is portrayed by Martina Gedeck.

=== Theater ===
Clara Schumann&#x27;s life has been explored in the chamber opera &quot;Clara&quot; by composer Victoria Bond and librettist Barbara Zinn-Krieger and the two-act opera &quot;Ghost Variations&quot; by composer Tony Manfredonia and librettist Aiden K. Feltkamp. &quot;Twin Spirits&quot;, a live theatrical performance involving a chamber ensemble of actors, singers, and musicians, also delves into Clara Schumann&#x27;s life story.

=== Banknote and conservatory ===

An image of Clara Schumann from an 1835 lithograph by Andreas Staub was featured on the 100 Deutsche Mark banknote from 2 January 1989 until the adoption of the euro on 1 January 2002. The back of the banknote shows a grand piano she played and the exterior of Dr. Hoch&#x27;s Konservatorium. The great hall of the conservatory&#x27;s new building is named after her.

<doc id="45182" wikidata="Q844273" url="?curid=45182" title="Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award">
<text>The Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award is awarded periodically by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences at the Governors Awards ceremonies to &quot;creative producers, whose bodies of work reflect a consistently high quality of motion picture production&quot;. The award is named for Irving Thalberg, head of the Production Division of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, who developed the company&#x27;s reputation for sophisticated films. The trophy itself was originally a bust of Thalberg rather than the familiar Oscar statuette. However, it is still counted as an &quot;Honorary Oscar&quot;. The bust of Thalberg was last used in 2018 when the award was presented to Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall. When the award was next presented at the 15th Governors Awards to Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson in 2024, the Oscar statuette was used instead.

The award was established in 1937 and was first presented at the 10th Academy Awards, in March 1938. Since 2009, it has been presented at the separate Governors Awards rather than at the main Academy Awards ceremony. 

The Award has been awarded 39 times to date. Katharine Hepburn made her only appearance at an Oscar ceremony to present the award to her long-time friend Lawrence Weingarten at the 46th Academy Awards ceremony in 1974.

==List of recipients==
==Other nominees==
The 11th Academy Awards, where the award was won by , marks the only occasion for which non-winning nominations were announced. The other nominees were: Samuel Goldwyn, Joe Pasternak, David O. Selznick, Hunt Stromberg, Walter Wanger, Darryl F. Zanuck.

<doc id="45185" wikidata="Q51547" url="?curid=45185" title="Billy Wilder">
<text>Billy Wilder (; ; born Samuel Wilder; June 22, 1906 – March 27, 2002) was an American filmmaker and screenwriter. He was born in Sucha Beskidzka, Poland, a town in Austria-Hungary at the time of his birth. His career in Hollywood spanned five decades, and he is regarded as one of the most brilliant and versatile filmmakers of Classic Hollywood cinema. He received seven Academy Awards (among 21 nominations), a BAFTA Award, the Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s Palme d&#x27;Or and two Golden Globe Awards.

Wilder became a screenwriter while living in Berlin. The rise of the Nazi Party and antisemitism in Germany saw him move to Paris. He then moved to Hollywood in 1934, and had a major hit when he, Charles Brackett and Walter Reisch wrote the screenplay for the Academy Award-nominated film &quot;Ninotchka&quot; (1939). Wilder established his directorial reputation and received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director with the film noir &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (1944), based on the novel by James M. Cain with a screenplay by Wilder and Raymond Chandler. Wilder won the Best Director and Best Screenplay Academy Awards for &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; (1945), which also won the Academy Award for Best Picture.

In the 1950s, Wilder directed and co-wrote a string of critically acclaimed films, including the Hollywood-set drama &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950), for which he won his second screenplay Academy Award; &quot;Ace in the Hole&quot; (1951), &quot;Stalag 17&quot; (1953) and &quot;Sabrina&quot; (1954). Wilder directed and co-wrote three films in 1957: &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, &quot;Love in the Afternoon&quot; and &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot;. During this period, Wilder also directed Marilyn Monroe in two films, &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot; (1955) and &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; (1959). In 1960, Wilder co-wrote, directed and produced the critically acclaimed film &quot;The Apartment&quot;. It won Wilder Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay.
Other notable films Wilder directed include &quot;One, Two, Three&quot; (1961), &quot;Irma la Douce&quot; (1963), &quot;Kiss Me, Stupid&quot; (1964), &quot;The Fortune Cookie&quot; (1966) and &quot;Avanti!&quot; (1972).

Wilder received various honors over his career, including the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1986, the Kennedy Center Honors in 1990, the National Medal of Arts in 1993 and the BAFTA Fellowship Award in 1995. He also received the Directors Guild of America&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award, the Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement and the Producers Guild of America&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award. Seven of his films are preserved in the United States National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Early life==
Samuel Wilder ( &quot;Shmuel Vilder&quot;) was born on June 22, 1906, to a Jewish family in Sucha, a small town in Galicia, present-day Poland, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Years later in Hollywood, he would describe it as being &quot;Half an hour from Vienna. By telegraph.&quot; His parents were Eugenia (&quot;née&quot; Dittler), from Zakopane, and Max Wilder, from Stanislawczyk; they met in Kraków where Billy spent his early years. His mother described him as a &quot;rambunctious kid&quot;; inspired by Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Shows, which she saw while living briefly in New York, she nicknamed him &quot;Billie&quot;, which he changed to &quot;Billy&quot; upon moving to America.

Wilder&#x27;s elder brother, W. Lee Wilder, was also a filmmaker. His parents had a successful cake shop in Sucha&#x27;s train station that flourished into a chain of railroad cafes. Eugenia and Max Wilder did not persuade their son to join the family business. Max moved to Kraków to manage a hotel before moving to Vienna and dying when Billy was 22 years old. After the family moved to Vienna, Wilder became a journalist instead of attending the University of Vienna. In 1926, jazz band leader Paul Whiteman was on tour in Vienna where he was interviewed by Wilder. Whiteman liked young Wilder enough that he took him with the band to Berlin, where Wilder was able to make more connections in entertainment.

Before achieving success as a writer, he was a taxi dancer in Berlin.

==Career==
===Early work===

After writing crime and sports stories as a stringer for local newspapers, he was eventually offered a regular job at a Berlin tabloid. Developing an interest in film, he began working as a screenwriter. From 1929 to 1933, he produced twelve German films. He collaborated with several other novices (Fred Zinnemann and Robert Siodmak) on the 1930 film &quot;People on Sunday&quot;. Eschewing the German Expressionist styles of F. W. Murnau and Fritz Lang, &quot;People on Sunday&quot; was considered as a groundbreaking example of the Neue Sachlichkeit or New Objectivity movement in German cinema. Furthermore, this genre of Strassenfilm (&quot;street film&quot;) paved way to the birth of Italian neorealism and the French New Wave. He wrote the screenplay for the 1931 film adaptation of a novel by Erich Kästner, &quot;Emil and the Detectives&quot;, also screenplays for the comedy &quot;The Man in Search of His Murderer&quot; (1931), the operetta &quot;Her Grace Commands&quot; (1931) and the comedy &quot;A Blonde Dream&quot; (1932), all of them produced in the Babelsberg Studios in Potsdam near Berlin. In 1932, Wilder collaborated with the writer and journalist Felix Salten on the screenplay for &quot;Scampolo&quot;. After Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, Wilder went to Paris, where he made his directorial debut film &quot;Mauvaise Graine&quot; (1934). He relocated to Hollywood prior to its release. Wilder&#x27;s mother, grandmother and stepfather were all victims of the Holocaust. For decades it was assumed that it happened at Auschwitz Concentration Camp, but, while researching Polish and Israeli archives, his Austrian biographer Andreas Hutter discovered in 2011 that they were murdered in different locations: his mother, Eugenia &quot;Gitla&quot; Siedlisker, in 1943 at Plaszow; his stepfather, Bernard &quot;Berl&quot; Siedlisker, in 1942 at Belzec; and his grandmother, Balbina Baldinger, died in 1943 in the ghetto in Nowy Targ.

After arriving in Hollywood in 1934, Wilder continued working as a screenwriter. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1939, having spent time in Mexico waiting for the government after his six-month card expired in 1934, an episode reflected in his 1941 &quot;Hold Back the Dawn&quot;. Wilder&#x27;s first significant success was &quot;Ninotchka&quot;, a collaboration with fellow German immigrant Ernst Lubitsch. The romantic comedy starred Greta Garbo (generally known as a tragic heroine in film melodramas), and was popularly and critically acclaimed. With the byline &quot;Garbo Laughs!&quot;, it also took Garbo&#x27;s career in a new direction. The film marked Wilder&#x27;s first Academy Award nomination, which he shared with co-writer Charles Brackett (although their collaboration on &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Eighth Wife&quot; and &quot;Midnight&quot; had been well received). Wilder co-wrote many of his films with Brackett from 1938 to 1950. Brackett described their collaboration process: &quot;The thing to do was suggest an idea, have it torn apart and despised. In a few days it would be apt to turn up, slightly changed, as Wilder&#x27;s idea. Once I got adjusted to that way of working, our lives were simpler.&quot; 

=== 1940s ===

Wilder continued his screenwriting career with a series of box office hits in the early 1940s, including the romantic drama &quot;Hold Back the Dawn&quot; and the screwball comedy &quot;Ball of Fire&quot;. Both films earned him nominations for the 1941 Academy Awards in the categories of Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Story respectively. Wilder made his Hollywood directorial debut in 1942 with &quot;The Major and the Minor&quot;, a comedy starring Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland.

His third Hollywood film as director, the film noir &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (1944), starring Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson, was a major hit. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, Director, Screenplay and Actress; Wilder co-wrote it with Raymond Chandler. The film not only set conventions for the noir genre (such as &quot;venetian blind&quot; lighting and voice-over narration), but is a landmark in the battle against Hollywood censorship. Based on James M. Cain&#x27;s novel, it featured two love triangles and a murder plotted for insurance money. While the book was popular with the reading public, it had been considered unfilmable under the Hays Code because adultery was central to the plot.

In 1945, the Psychological Warfare Department of the United States Department of War produced an American documentary film directed by Wilder. The film known as &quot;Death Mills&quot;, or &quot;Die Todesmühlen&quot;, was intended for German audiences to educate them about the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime. For the German version, &quot;Die Todesmühlen&quot;, Hanuš Burger is credited as the writer and director, while Wilder supervised the editing. Wilder is credited with the English-language version.

Two years later, Wilder adapted from Charles R. Jackson&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; into a film of the same name. It was the first major American film with a serious examination of alcoholism, another difficult theme under the Production Code. It follows an alcoholic writer (Ray Milland) opposing the protestations of his girlfriend (Jane Wyman). The film earned critical acclaim after it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and competed in the main competition, where it received the Festival&#x27;s top prize, the Palme d&#x27;Or, and four Academy Awards including for Best Picture. Wilder earned the Oscars for Best Director and Best Screenplay and Milland won Best Actor. The film remained to be one of the three films, winning both the Academy Award for Best Picture and the Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s Palme d&#x27; Or, alongside &quot;Marty&quot; and &quot;Parasite&quot;.

=== 1950s ===

In 1950, Wilder co-wrote and directed the cynical noir film &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;. It follows a reclusive silent film actress (Gloria Swanson), who dreams of a comeback with delusions of her greatness from a bygone era. She accompanies an aspiring screenwriter (William Holden), who becomes her gigolo partner. This critically acclaimed film was the final film Wilder collaborated with Brackett. The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards; together Wilder and Brackett won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

In 1951, Wilder directed &quot;Ace in the Hole&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Big Carnival&quot;) starring Kirk Douglas in a tale of media exploitation of a caving accident. The idea had been pitched over the phone to Wilder&#x27;s secretary by Victor Desny. Desny sued Wilder for breach of an implied contract in the California copyright case &quot;Wilder v Desny&quot;, ultimately receiving a settlement of $14,350. Although a critical and commercial failure at the time, its reputation has grown over the years. The following year, Wilder announced plans to direct and produce a film version of the Sophocles tragedy &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, adapted for the screen by Walter Reisch. They planned to shoot the film on location in Greece in Technicolor, but it never went into production.

Subsequently, Wilder directed three adaptations of Broadway plays, war drama &quot;Stalag 17&quot;, for which William Holden won the Best Actor Academy Award, romantic comedy &quot;Sabrina&quot;, for which Audrey Hepburn was nominated for Best Actress, and romantic comedy &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot;, which features the iconic image of Marilyn Monroe standing on a subway grate as her white dress is blown upwards by a passing train. Wilder was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for the first two films and shared a nomination for Best Screenplay for the second. He was interested in doing a film with one of the classic slapstick comedy acts of the Hollywood Golden Age. He first considered, and rejected, a project to star Laurel and Hardy. He held discussions with Groucho Marx concerning a new Marx Brothers comedy, tentatively titled &quot;A Day at the U.N&quot;. The project was abandoned after Chico Marx died in 1961.

In 1957, three films Wilder directed were released: biopic &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, starring James Stewart as Charles Lindbergh, romantic comedy &quot;Love in the Afternoon&quot;—Wilder&#x27;s first screenplay with I. A. L. Diamond, who would become his regular partner—featuring Gary Cooper, Maurice Chevalier and Audrey Hepburn, and courtroom drama &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot;, featuring Tyrone Power, Marlene Dietrich and Charles Laughton. Wilder received an Academy Award nomination for Best Director for the last film.
In 1959, Wilder reunited with Monroe in the United Artists released Prohibition-era farce film &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;. It was released, however, without a Production Code seal of approval, which was withheld due to the film&#x27;s unabashed sexual comedy, including a central cross-dressing theme. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis played musicians disguised as women to escape pursuit by a Chicago gang. Curtis&#x27;s character courts a singer (Monroe), while Lemmon is wooed by Joe E. Brownsetting up the film&#x27;s final joke in which Lemmon reveals that his character is a man and Brown blandly replies &quot;Well, nobody&#x27;s perfect&quot;. A box office success, the film was lightly regarded by film critics during its original release, although it did receive six Academy Award nominations, including for Best Director and Best Screenplay. But its critical reputation grew prodigiously; in 2000, the American Film Institute selected it as the best American comedy ever made. In 2012, the British Film Institute decennial &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; poll of the world&#x27;s film critics rated it as the 43rd best movie ever made, and the second-highest-ranking comedy.

=== 1960s ===

In 1960, Wilder directed the comedy romance film &quot;The Apartment&quot;. It follows an insurance clerk (Lemmon), who allows his coworkers to use his apartment to conduct extramarital affairs until he meets an elevator woman (Shirley MacLaine). The film was a critical success with &quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Bosley Crowther, who called the film &quot;gleeful, tender, and even sentimental&quot; and Wilder&#x27;s direction &quot;ingenious&quot;. The film received ten Academy Awards nominations and won five awards, including three for Wilder: Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay.

Wilder directed the Cold War political farce film &quot;One, Two, Three&quot; (1961), starring James Cagney, which won critical praise with &quot;Variety&quot; writing, &quot;Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;One, Two, Three&quot; is a fast-paced, high-pitched, hard-hitting, lighthearted farce crammed with topical gags and spiced with satirical overtones. Story is so furiously quick-witted that some of its wit gets snarled and smothered in overlap.&quot; It was followed by the romantic comedy &quot;Irma la Douce&quot; (1963) starring Lemmon and MacLaine. The film was the fifth highest-grossing film of the year. Wilder received a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for his screenplay. Wilder then wrote and directed the sex comedy film &quot;Kiss Me, Stupid&quot; starring Dean Martin, Kim Novak, and Ray Walston, who was a last minute replacement for ailing Peter Sellers. The film was criticized by some critics for vulgarity, with Bosley Crowther blaming the film for giving American movies the reputation of &quot;deliberate and degenerate corruptors of public taste and morals&quot;. A. H. Weiler of the &quot;New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;pitifully unfunny&quot;. Wilder gained his final Academy Award nomination and a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for the screenplay of &quot;The Fortune Cookie&quot;, which he co-produced through his independent film company, Phalanx Productions. It was the first film pairing Jack Lemmon with Walter Matthau. The film was titled &quot;Meet Whiplash Willie&quot; in the United Kingdom. In 1970, he directed &quot;The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, also made through Phalanx Productions, which was intended as a major roadshow theatrical release, but to Wilder&#x27;s dismay was heavily cut by the studio.

=== Final films ===
He produced and directed the comedy film &quot;Avanti!&quot;, again through Phalanx Productions, which follows a businessman (Lemmon) attempting to retrieve the body of his deceased father from Italy. Wilder received two Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Director and Best Screenplay, and a Writers Guild of America Award nomination. Wilder directed &quot;The Front Page&quot; based on the Broadway play of the same name. It was a significant financial success with low budget. His final films, &quot;Fedora&quot; and &quot;Buddy Buddy&quot;, failed to impress critics or the public, although &quot;Fedora&quot; has since been re-evaluated and is now considered favorably. Wilder had hoped to make Thomas Keneally&#x27;s &quot;Schindler&#x27;s Ark&quot; as his final film, saying &quot;I wanted to do it as a kind of memorial to my mother and my grandmother and my stepfather,&quot; who had all been murdered in the Holocaust. He praised Steven Spielberg&#x27;s adaptation, &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;. To those who denied the Holocaust, Wilder wrote in a German newspaper, &quot;If the concentration camps and the gas chambers were all imaginary, then please tell me—where is my mother?&quot;

==Directorial style==
Wilder&#x27;s directorial choices reflected his belief in the primacy of writing. He avoided, especially in the second half of his career, the exuberant cinematography of Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles because, in Wilder&#x27;s opinion, shots that called attention to themselves would distract the audience from the story. Wilder&#x27;s films have tight plotting and memorable dialogue. Despite his conservative directorial style, his subject matter often pushed the boundaries of mainstream entertainment. Once a subject was chosen, he would begin to visualize in terms of specific artists. His belief was that no matter how talented the actor, none were without limitations and the result would be better if you bent the script to their personality rather than force a performance beyond their limitations. Wilder was skilled at working with actors, coaxing silent era legends Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stroheim out of retirement for roles in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;. Regarding Wilder&#x27;s more comedic films, Roger Ebert wrote: &quot;he took the characters seriously, or at least as seriously as the material allowed, and got a lot of the laughs by playing scenes straight.&quot;

For &quot;Stalag 17&quot;, Wilder squeezed an Oscar-winning performance out of a reluctant William Holden (Holden had wanted to make his character more likable; Wilder refused). At a casting meeting, Wilder reportedly said, &quot;I&#x27;m tired of clichéd typecasting—the same people in every film.&quot; An example of this is Wilder&#x27;s casting of Fred MacMurray in &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; and &quot;The Apartment&quot;. MacMurray had become Hollywood&#x27;s highest-paid actor portraying a decent, thoughtful character in light comedies, melodramas, and musicals; Wilder cast him as a womanizing schemer. Humphrey Bogart shed his tough-guy image to give one of his warmest performances in &quot;Sabrina&quot;. James Cagney, not usually known for comedy, was memorable in a high-octane comic role for Wilder&#x27;s &quot;One, Two, Three&quot;. Wilder coaxed a very effective performance out of Monroe in &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;.

In total, he directed fourteen different actors in Oscar-nominated performances: Barbara Stanwyck in &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, Ray Milland in &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot;, William Holden in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; and &quot;Stalag 17&quot;, Gloria Swanson, Erich von Stroheim and Nancy Olson in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, Robert Strauss in &quot;Stalag 17&quot;, Audrey Hepburn in &quot;Sabrina&quot;, Charles Laughton in &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot;, Elsa Lanchester in &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot;, Jack Lemmon in &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; and &quot;The Apartment&quot;, Jack Kruschen in &quot;The Apartment&quot;, Shirley MacLaine in &quot;The Apartment&quot; and &quot;Irma la Douce&quot; and Walter Matthau in &quot;The Fortune Cookie&quot;. Wilder mentored Lemmon, and was the first director to pair him and Matthau in &quot;The Fortune Cookie&quot;. Wilder and Lemmon worked on seven films.

==Politics==
Wilder opposed the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). He co-created the Committee for the First Amendment, of 500 Hollywood personalities and stars to &quot;support those professionals called upon to testify before the HUAC who had classified themselves as hostile with regard to the interrogations and the interrogators&quot;. Some anti-Communists wanted those in the cinema industry to take oaths of allegiance. The Screen Directors Guild had a vote by show of hands. Only John Huston and Wilder opposed. Huston said, &quot;I am sure it was one of the bravest things that Billy, as a naturalized German, had ever done. There were 150 to 200 directors at this meeting, and here Billy and I sat alone with our hands raised in protest against the loyalty oath.&quot;

Wilder was not affected by the Hollywood blacklist. Of the blacklisted &#x27;Hollywood Ten&#x27; he said, &quot;Of the ten, two had talent, and the rest were just unfriendly.&quot; In general, Wilder disliked formula and genre films. Wilder reveled in poking fun at those who took politics too seriously. In &quot;Ball of Fire&quot;, his burlesque queen &#x27;Sugarpuss&#x27; points at her sore throat and complains &quot;Pink? It&#x27;s as red as the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; and just as sore.&quot; Later, she gives the overbearing and unsmiling housemaid the name &quot;Franco&quot;.

==Retirement==

Wilder received the American Film Institute (AFI) Life Achievement Award in 1986. He received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award in 1988, the Kennedy Center Honors in 1990 and the National Medal of Arts in 1993. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Wilder became well known for owning one of the finest and most extensive art collections in Hollywood, mainly collecting modern art. As he described it in the mid-80s, &quot;It&#x27;s a sickness. I don&#x27;t know how to stop myself. Call it bulimia if you want – or curiosity or passion. I have some Impressionists, some Picassos from every period, some mobiles by Calder. I also collect tiny Japanese trees, glass paperweights, and Chinese vases. Name an object and I collect it.&quot; Wilder&#x27;s artistic ambitions led him to create a series of works of his own. By the early &#x27;90s, Wilder had amassed many plastic-artistic constructions, many of which were made in collaboration with artist Bruce Houston. In 1993, art dealer Louis Stern, a longtime friend, helped organize an exhibition of Wilder&#x27;s work at his Beverly Hills gallery. The exhibition was titled &quot;Billy Wilder&#x27;s Marché aux Puces&quot; and the &quot;Variations on the Theme of Queen Nefertete&quot; segment was notably popular. This series featured busts of the Egyptian queen wrapped &quot;à la&quot; Christo, or splattered &quot;à la&quot; Jackson Pollock, or sporting a Campbell&#x27;s soup can in homage to Andy Warhol.

==Personal life and death==
Wilder married Judith Coppicus on December 22, 1936. The couple had twins, Victoria and Vincent (born 1939), but Vincent died shortly after birth. They divorced in 1946. Wilder met Audrey Young while filming &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot;. They were married on June 30, 1949.

Wilder died of pneumonia on March 27, 2002. He was buried at Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park and Mortuary. A French newspaper, &quot;Le Monde&quot;, titled the front-page obituary: &quot;Billy Wilder is dead. Nobody is perfect&quot;, a reference to the last line of &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Don&#x27;t be boring&quot;. — Billy Wilder

Wilder holds a significant place in the history of Hollywood censorship for expanding the range of acceptable subject matter. He directed two of film noir&#x27;s definitive films, &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; and &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;. Along with Woody Allen and the Marx Brothers, he leads the list of films on the American Film Institute&#x27;s AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs and he earned the top spot on it with &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;. Also on the list are &quot;The Apartment&quot; and &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot;, which he directed, and &quot;Ball of Fire&quot; and &quot;Ninotchka&quot;, which he co-wrote. The AFI listed &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; and &quot;The Apartment&quot; on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Movies. Wilder was ranked 6th in director&#x27;s poll on Sight &amp; Sound&#x27;s 2002 list of &quot;The Greatest Directors of All Time&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Wilder at No. 24 in its &quot;50 Greatest Directors&quot; list. Wilder was ranked at No. 19 on &quot;Empire&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Top 40 Greatest Directors of All-Time&quot; list in 2005. In 2007, &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine ranked Wilder at No. 13 on its &quot;100 Greatest Film Directors Ever&quot; list. Wilder was voted at No. 4 on the &quot;Greatest Directors of 20th Century&quot; poll conducted by Japanese film magazine &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot;.

Seven of his films are preserved in the United States National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;. Anthony Lane writes that &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot;, &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; and &quot;The Apartment&quot; are &quot;part of the lexicon of moviegoing&quot; and that &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; is a &quot;national treasure.&quot; Roger Ebert asked, &quot;Of all the great directors of Hollywood&#x27;s golden age, has anybody made more films that are as fresh and entertaining to this day as Billy Wilder&#x27;s?...And who else can field three contenders among the greatest closing lines of all time?&quot;, citing the closing lines of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, &quot;Some Like it Hot&quot;, and &quot;The Apartment&quot;. Ron Shelton recalls encountering Wilder:

 I was in a restaurant about six months after &quot;Bull Durham&quot; came out. And a man came over and said &quot;Somebody would like to see you.&quot; And I looked over and it was Billy Wilder. And I went over and he said, &quot;Great fuckin&#x27; picture, kid!&quot; And I thought that was as good a review as you could have.&quot;

When &quot;Belle Époque&quot; won the 1993 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, Spanish filmmaker Fernando Trueba said in his acceptance speech: &quot;I would like to believe in God in order to thank him. But I just believe in Billy Wilder... so thank you, Mr. Wilder.&quot; According to Trueba, Wilder called him the day after and told him: &quot;Fernando, it&#x27;s God.&quot; French filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius thanked Billy Wilder in the 2012 Best Picture Oscar acceptance speech for &quot;The Artist&quot;: &quot;I would like to thank the following three people, I would like to thank Billy Wilder, I would like to thank Billy Wilder, and I would like to thank Billy Wilder.&quot; Wilder&#x27;s 12 Academy Award nominations for screenwriting were a record until 1997 when Woody Allen received a 13th nomination for &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot;. In 2017, Vulture.com named Wilder the greatest screenwriter of all time. He directed fourteen actors in Oscar-nominated performances. Wilder&#x27;s epitaph, a paraphrase of the last line of &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;, is &quot;I&#x27;m a writer but then nobody&#x27;s perfect.&quot;

==Filmography==


==Awards and honors==

Wilder received twenty-one nominations at the Academy Awards, winning six. In total, he received twelve nominations for his screenwriting, eight for his direction, and one for producing. He won both the Academy Award for Best Director and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for both &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; (1945) and &quot;The Apartment&quot; (1960). The former was awarded the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film at the Cannes Film Festival, and the latter also won him the BAFTA Award for Best Film. Wilder garnered eight Directors Guild of America Award nominations, with the sole win for his work on &quot;The Apartment&quot;. He received seven nominations at the Golden Globe Awards, winning Best Director for &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; and &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950). He won seven Writers Guild of America Awards including two Laurel Awards for Screenwriting Achievement. He garnered a number of lifetime achievement awards including the Irving G.

<text>Paul Muni (born Frederich Meshilem Meier Weisenfreund; September 22, 1895 – August 25, 1967) was an American stage and film actor from Chicago. He started his acting career in the Yiddish theater and during the 1930s, he was considered one of the most prestigious actors at the Warner Bros. studio and was given the rare privilege of choosing his own parts.

Muni often played powerful characters, such as the lead role in &quot;Scarface&quot; (1932), and was known for his intense preparation for his parts, often immersing himself in the study of the real characters&#x27; traits and mannerisms. He was also highly skilled in makeup techniques, a talent that he had learned from his parents, who were also actors, and from his early years on stage with the Yiddish theater in Chicago. At the age of 12, he played the stage role of an 80-year-old man, and in the film &quot;Seven Faces,&quot; he played seven characters.

Muni appeared in 22 films and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor five times, winning the award for his role in the 1936 film &quot;The Story of Louis Pasteur&quot;. He also starred in numerous Broadway plays and won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his role in the 1955 production of &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;.

== Early life and career ==

Muni was born in 1895 as Frederich Meier Weisenfreund to a Jewish family in Lemberg, Galicia, then Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Lviv, Ukraine). His Hebrew name was Meshilem. His parents were Salli (born Khaya Tsilke Fishler) and Phillip Weisenfreund. He learned Yiddish as his first language. When he was seven, he emigrated with his family to the United States in 1902; they settled in Chicago.

As a boy, he was known as &quot;Moony&quot;. He started his acting career in the Yiddish theatre in Chicago with his parents, who were both actors. As a teenager, he developed skill in creating makeup, which enabled him to play much older characters. Film historian Robert Osborne notes that Muni&#x27;s makeup skills were so creative that for most of his roles, &quot;he transformed his appearance so completely, he was dubbed &#x27;the new Lon Chaney.&#x27;&quot; In his first stage role at the age of 12, Muni played the role of an 80-year-old man. He was quickly recognized by Maurice Schwartz, who signed him to perform in his Yiddish Art Theater.

A 1925 &quot;New York Times&quot; article mentioned Sam Kasten&#x27;s and Muni&#x27;s performances at the People&#x27;s Theater among the highlights of the year&#x27;s Yiddish theater season, describing them as second only to Ludwig Satz.

Muni began acting on Broadway in 1926. His first role was that of an elderly Jewish man in the play &quot;We Americans&quot;, written by playwrights Max Siegel and Milton Herbert Gropper. It was the first time that he had acted in English.

In 1921, he married Bella Finkel (February 8, 1898 – October 1, 1971), an actress in the Yiddish theatre and daughter of Moishe Finkel. They remained married until Muni&#x27;s death in 1967.

== Hollywood ==
In 1929, Muni was signed by Fox. His name was simplified and anglicized to Paul Muni (derived from his nickname of youth &quot;Moony&quot;). His acting talents were quickly recognized, and he received an Oscar nomination for his first film, &quot;The Valiant&quot; (1929), although the film fared poorly at the box office. His second film, &quot;Seven Faces&quot; (also 1929), was also a financial failure. Unhappy with the roles offered to him, he returned to Broadway, where he starred in a major hit play, &quot;Counsellor at Law&quot;.

Muni soon returned to Hollywood to star in provocative pre-Code films such as &quot;Scarface&quot; and &quot;I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang&quot; (both 1932). For his role in &quot;I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang&quot;, Muni was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor. His acclaim as a result of his performance impressed Warner Bros., which signed him to a long-term contract, publicizing him as &quot;the screen&#x27;s greatest actor.&quot;

&quot;Scarface&quot;, part of a cycle of gangster films at the time, was written by Ben Hecht and directed by Howard Hawks. Critic Richard Corliss noted in 1974 that while it was a serious gangster film, it also &quot;manages both to congratulate journalism for its importance and to chastise it for its chicanery, by underlining the newspapers&#x27; complicity in promoting the underworld image.&quot;

In 1935, Muni starred in &quot;Black Fury&quot;. At the 8th Academy Awards, Muni was not officially nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, but he came in second on the basis of write-in votes, which were allowed that year.

Muni persuaded Warner Bros. to take a financial risk by producing the successful historical biography &quot;The Story of Louis Pasteur&quot;, which was released in 1936. This became Muni&#x27;s first of many biographical roles. Until that film, most Warner Bros. stories had originated from current events and major news stories, with the notable exceptions of George Arliss&#x27;s earlier biographical films &quot;Disraeli&quot;, &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot; and &quot;Voltaire&quot;. Muni won an Oscar for his performance.

Muni played other historical figures, including Émile Zola in &quot;The Life of Emile Zola&quot; (1937), for which he was again nominated for an Oscar. The film won Best Picture and was interpreted as indirectly attacking the repression of Nazi Germany. He also played the lead role in &quot;Juarez&quot; (1939).

In 1937, Muni played a Chinese peasant with a new bride in a film adaptation of Pearl Buck&#x27;s novel &quot;The Good Earth&quot;. The film was a recreation of a revolutionary period in China and included special effects for a locust attack and the overthrow of the government. Because Muni was not of Asian descent, when producer Irving Thalberg offered him the role, he said, &quot;I&#x27;m about as Chinese as [President] Herbert Hoover.&quot;

Dissatisfied with life in Hollywood, Muni chose not to renew his contract. He returned to the screen only occasionally in later years for such roles as Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s teacher in &quot;A Song to Remember&quot; (1945). In 1946, he played a rare comic role in &quot;Angel on My Shoulder&quot;.

== Later career ==

Muni then focused most of his energies on stage work, and occasionally on television roles. In 1946, he appeared on Broadway in &quot;A Flag is Born&quot;, written by Ben Hecht, to help promote the creation of a Jewish state in Israel. This play was directed by Luther Adler and co-starred Marlon Brando. Years later, in response to a question put to him by Alan King, Brando stated that Muni was the greatest actor he ever saw. At London&#x27;s Phoenix Theatre on July 28, 1949, Muni began a run as Willy Loman in the first British production of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; by Arthur Miller. He took over from Lee J. Cobb, who had played the principal role in the original Broadway production. Both productions were directed by Elia Kazan.

In 1952, Muni traveled to Italy to star in &quot;Stranger on the Prowl&quot; directed by Joseph Losey, partly as an act of solidarity and support for blacklisted friends living abroad in exile.

A few years later, during 1955 and 1956, Muni had his biggest stage success in the United States as the crusading lawyer, Henry Drummond (based on Clarence Darrow), in &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;, winning a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play. In late August 1955, Muni was forced to withdraw from the play due to a serious eye ailment causing deterioration in his eyesight. He was later replaced by actor Melvyn Douglas.

In early September 1955, Muni, then 59 years old, was diagnosed with a tumor of the left eye. The eye was removed in an operation at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York. His right eye was reported to be normal. In early December 1955, Muni returned to his starring role as Henry Drummond in &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;.

His last movie role was as an aging doctor in &quot;The Last Angry Man&quot; (1959), and he was again nominated for an Oscar. After that, Muni mostly retired from acting to deal with failing eyesight and other health problems. He made his final screen appearance on television, in a guest role on the dramatic series &quot;Saints and Sinners&quot; in 1962.

== Acting techniques, reputation and legacy ==

Muni was noted for his intense preparation for his roles, especially the biographies. While preparing for &quot;The Story of Louis Pasteur&quot;, Muni said, &quot;I read most everything that was in the library, and everything I could lay my hands on that had to do with Pasteur, with Lister, or with his contemporaries.&quot; He did the same in preparing for his role as Henry Drummond, based on Clarence Darrow, in the play &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;. He read what he could find, talked to people who knew Darrow personally, and studied physical mannerisms from photographs of him. &quot;To Paul Muni, acting was not just a career, but an obsession&quot;, writes &quot;The New York Times&quot;. They note that despite his enormous success both on Broadway and in films, &quot;he threw himself into each role with a sense of dedication.&quot; Playwright Arthur Miller commented that Muni &quot;was pursued by a fear of failure.&quot;

As Muni was born into an acting family, with both of his parents professional actors, &quot;he learned his craft carefully and thoroughly.&quot; On stage, &quot;a Muni whisper could reach the last balcony of any theater&quot;, writes the &quot;Times&quot;. It wrote that his style &quot;had drawn into it the warmth of the Yiddish stage&quot;, in which he made his debut at the age of 12. In addition, his technique in using makeup &quot;was a work of art.&quot; Combined with acting which followed no &quot;method&quot;, he perfected his control of voice and gestures into an acting style that was &quot;unique.&quot;

Film historian David Shipman described Muni as &quot;an actor of great integrity&quot;, noting he meticulously prepared for his roles. Muni was widely recognized as eccentric if talented: he objected to anyone wearing red in his presence, and he could often be found between sessions playing his violin. Over the years, he became increasingly dependent on his wife, Bella, a dependence which increased as his failing eyesight turned to blindness in his final years. Muni was &quot;inflexible on matters of taste and principle&quot;, once turning down an $800,000 movie contract because he was not happy with the studio&#x27;s choice of film roles.

Although Muni was considered one of the best film actors of the 1930s, some film critics such as David Thomson and Andrew Sarris, accuse him of overacting. Thomson described Muni as &quot;a crucial negative illustration in any argument as to what constitutes screen acting.&quot;

German director William Dieterle, who directed him in his three biopics, also frequently accused him of overacting, despite his respect for the actor.

== Personal life ==

In his private life, Muni was considered to be very shy and was uncomfortable with being recognized in public. He enjoyed reading and taking walks with his wife in secluded sections of Central Park.

Muni campaigned for the reelection of President Herbert Hoover in 1932.

After retiring from acting, he lived in California. In his den, which he called his &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, he spent time reading books and listening to the radio.

== Death ==
Muni died of a heart disorder in Montecito, California in 1967 at the age of 71. He is interred at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood.

== Legacy and honors ==
Muni had four official Academy Award nominations for Best Actor, winning for &quot;The Story of Louis Pasteur&quot; (1936) and receiving official nominations for &quot;I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang&quot; (1932), &quot;The Life of Emile Zola&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Last Angry Man&quot; (1959). His nomination for the film &quot;The Valiant&quot; (1929) is unofficial because at the 2nd Academy Awards, acting nominees were not announced, only the winners&#x27; names. Muni&#x27;s performance in &quot;Black Fury&quot; was not nominated for an Oscar.
* New York Film Critics Circle Award for &quot;The Life of Emile Zola&quot;
* Tony Award for Best Actor in &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;
* A star was installed in his honor on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6435 Hollywood Blvd.
* A film musical titled &quot;Actor: The Paul Muni Story&quot; (1978) was based on his life, with Herschel Bernardi starring.
* A biography titled &quot;&quot; (1974) was written by Jerome Lawrence.

== In popular culture ==
Referring to his childhood during the Great Depression, Hawkeye Pierce in the &quot;Hawkeye&quot; episode of the television series &quot;M*A*S*H*&quot; says: &quot;You knew where you stood in those days. Franklin Roosevelt was always president, Joe Louis was always the champ, and Paul Muni played everybody.&quot;

Muni and George Raft appeared as characters in the fifth season of &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;, meeting with Al Capone to discuss the film &quot;Scarface&quot;.

Comedian and actor Paul Mooney took his stage name, which was also his childhood nickname, from Muni.

<doc id="45189" wikidata="Q146470" url="?curid=45189" title="Brandy">
<text>Brandy is a liquor produced by distilling wine. Brandy generally contains 35–60% alcohol by volume (70–120 US proof) and is typically consumed as an after-dinner digestif. Some brandies are aged in wooden casks. Others are coloured with caramel colouring to imitate the effect of ageing, and some are produced using a combination of ageing and colouring. Varieties of wine brandy can be found across the winemaking world. Among the most renowned are Cognac and Armagnac from south-western France.

In a broader sense, the term &quot;brandy&quot; also denotes liquors obtained from the distillation of pomace (yielding pomace brandy), or mash or wine of any other fruit (fruit brandy). These products are also called &quot;eau de vie&quot; (literally &quot;water of life&quot; in French).

==History==
The origins of brandy are tied to the development of distillation. While the process was known in classical times, it was not significantly used for beverage production until the 15th century. In the early 16th-century French brandy helped kickstart the cross-Atlantic triangle trade when it took over the central role of the Portuguese fortified wine due to its higher alcohol content and ease of shipping. Canoemen and guards on the African side of the trade were generally paid in brandy. By the late 17th century, the cheaper rum had replaced brandy as the exchange alcohol of choice in the triangle trade.

Initially, wine was distilled as a preservation method and to make it easier for merchants to transport. It is also thought that wine was originally distilled to lessen the tax, which was assessed by volume. The intent was to add the water removed by distillation back to the brandy shortly before consumption. It was discovered that after being stored in wooden casks, the resulting product improved over the original distilled spirit. In addition to removing water, the distillation process led to the formation and decomposition of numerous aromatic compounds, fundamentally altering the distillate composition from its source. Non-volatile substances such as pigments, sugars, and salts remained behind in the still. As a result, the distillate taste was often quite unlike the sources.

As described in the 1728 edition of &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot;, the following method was used to distill brandy:
A cucurbit was filled half full of the liquor from which brandy was to be drawn and then raised with a little fire until about one-sixth part was distilled, or until that which falls into the receiver was entirely flammable. This liquor, distilled only once, was called the &quot;spirit of wine&quot; or &quot;brandy&quot;. Purified by another distillation (or several more), this was called &quot;spirit of wine rectified&quot;. The second distillation was made in [a] &quot;balneo mariae&quot; and in a glass cucurbit, and the liquor was distilled to about one-half the quantity. This was further rectified as long as the operator thought it necessary to produce brandy.

To shorten these several distillations, which were long and troublesome, a chemical instrument was invented that reduced them to a single distillation. A portion was ignited to test the purity of the rectified spirit of wine. The liquor was good if a fire consumed the entire contents without leaving any impurities behind. Another, better test involved putting a little gunpowder in the bottom of the spirit. The liquor was good if the gunpowder could ignite after the spirit was consumed by fire. (Hence the modern &quot;proof&quot; to describe alcohol content.)

As most brandies have been distilled from grapes, the regions of the world producing excellent brandies have roughly paralleled those areas producing grapes for viniculture. At the end of the 19th century, the western European markets, including by extension their overseas empires, were dominated by French and Spanish brandies and eastern Europe was dominated by brandies from the Black Sea region, including Bulgaria, the Crimea, Georgia and Armenia. In 1877, the Ararat brandy brand was established in Yerevan, Armenia. It became one of the top brandy brands over time and during the Yalta Conference, Winston Churchill was so impressed with the Armenian brandy Dvin given to him by Joseph Stalin that he asked for several cases of it to be sent to him each year. Reportedly 400 bottles of Dvin were shipped to Churchill annually. In 1884, David Sarajishvili founded a brandy factory in Tbilisi, Georgia, a crossroads for Turkish, Central Asian, and Persian trade routes and a part of the Russian Empire at the time.

==Technology==
Except for a few major producers, brandy production and consumption tend to have a regional character, and thus production methods significantly vary. Wine brandy is produced from a variety of grape cultivars. A special selection of cultivars, providing distinct aroma and character, is used for high-quality brandies, while cheaper ones are made from whichever wine is available.

Brandy is made from so-called base wine, which significantly differs from regular table wines. It is made from early grapes to achieve higher acid concentration and lower sugar levels. Base wine generally contains smaller amounts (up to 20 mg/L) of sulphur than regular wines, as it creates undesired copper(II) sulfate in reaction with copper in the pot stills. The yeast sediment produced during the fermentation may or may not be kept in the wine, depending on the brandy style.

Brandy is distilled from the base wine in two phases. First, a large part of water and solids is removed from the base, obtaining so-called &quot;low wine&quot;, a concentrated wine with 28–30% ABV. In the second stage, low wine is distilled into brandy. The liquid exits the pot still in three phases, referred to as the &quot;heads&quot;, &quot;heart&quot;, and &quot;tails&quot;, respectively. The first part, the &quot;head&quot;, has an alcohol concentration of about 83% (166 US proof) and an unpleasant odour. The weak portion on the end, the &quot;tail&quot;, is discarded along with the head, and they are generally mixed with another batch of low wine, thereby entering the distillation cycle again. The middle heart fraction, the richest in aromas and flavours, is preserved for later maturation.

Distillation does not simply enhance the alcohol content of wine. The heat under which the product is distilled and the material of the still (usually copper) cause chemical reactions during distillation. This leads to the formation of numerous new volatile aroma components, changes in relative amounts of aroma components in the wine, and the hydrolysis of components such as esters.

Brandy is usually produced in pot stills (batch distillation), but the column still can also be used for continuous distillation. The distillate obtained in this manner has a higher alcohol concentration (approximately 90% ABV) and is less aromatic. The choice of the apparatus depends on the style of brandy produced. Cognac and South African brandy are examples of brandy produced in batches while many American brandies use fractional distillation in column stills.

==Chemistry==
===Chemical Compounds in Brandy===
Some of the key compounds found in brandy include:

Ethanol (C₂H₅OH): The primary alcohol responsible for intoxication.

Esters: Such as ethyl acetate, contributing to fruity flavors.

Aldehydes: Like acetaldehyde, adding to the aroma.

Tannins: From the wood, providing astringency.

===Aging===
After distillation, the unaged brandy is placed into oak barrels to mature. Usually, brandies with a natural golden or brown colour are aged in oak casks (single-barrel ageing). Some brandies, particularly those from Spain, are aged using the solera system, where the producer changes the barrel each year. After a period of ageing, which depends on the style, class and legal requirements, the mature brandy is mixed with distilled water to reduce alcohol concentration and bottled. Some brandies have caramel colour and sugar added to simulate the appearance of barrel ageing.

==Consumption==
===Serving===
Brandy is traditionally served at room temperature (neat) from a snifter, a wine glass or a tulip glass. When drunk at room temperature, it is often slightly warmed by holding the glass cupped in the palm or by gentle heating. Excessive heating of brandy may cause the alcohol vapour to become too strong, causing its aroma to become overpowering. Brandy-drinkers who like their brandy warmed may ask for the glass to be heated before the brandy is poured.

Brandy may be added to other beverages to make several popular cocktails; these include the Brandy Sour, the Brandy Alexander, the Sidecar, the Brandy Daisy, and the Brandy Old Fashioned.

Anglo-Indian usage has &quot;brandy-pawnee&quot; (brandy with water).

===Culinary uses===

Brandy is a common deglazing liquid used in making pan sauces for steak and other meat. It creates a more intense flavour in some soups, notably onion soup.

In English Christmas cooking, brandy is a common flavouring in traditional foods such as Christmas cake, brandy butter, and Christmas pudding. It is also commonly used in drinks such as mulled wine and eggnog, drunk during the festive season.

Brandy is used to flambé dishes such as crêpe Suzette and cherries jubilee while serving. Brandy is traditionally poured over a Christmas pudding and set alight before serving. The use of flambé can retain as much as 75% of the alcohol in the brandy.

=== Historical medical uses ===
In the 19th century, brandy was often used as medical treatment due to its alleged &quot;stimulating&quot; qualities. It was also used by many European explorers of tropical Africa, who suggested that regular, moderate doses of brandy might help a traveller to cope with fever, depression, and stress. These views fell out of favour in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, with suggestions that people were using brandy&#x27;s &quot;medical&quot; qualities as an excuse for social drinking.

== Terminology and legal definitions ==

The term &quot;brandy&quot; is a shortening of the archaic English &quot;brandewine&quot; or &quot;brandywine&quot;, which was derived from the Dutch word &quot;brandewijn&quot;, itself derived from &quot;gebrande wijn&quot;, which literally means &quot;burned wine&quot; and whose cognates include &quot;brännvin&quot; and &quot;brennivín&quot;. In Germany, the term &quot;Branntwein&quot; refers to any distilled spirits, while &quot;Weinbrand&quot; refers specifically to distilled wine from grapes.

In the general colloquial usage of the term, brandy may also be made from pomace and from fermented fruit other than grapes. If a beverage comes from a particular fruit (or multiple fruits) other than exclusively grapes, or from the must of such fruit, it may be referred to as a &quot;fruit brandy&quot; or &quot;fruit spirit&quot; or named using the specific fruit, such as &quot;peach brandy&quot;, rather than just generically as &quot;brandy&quot;. If pomace is the raw material, the beverage may be called &quot;pomace brandy&quot;, &quot;marc brandy&quot;, &quot;grape marc&quot;, &quot;fruit marc spirit&quot;, or &quot;grape marc spirit&quot;, &quot;marc&quot; being the pulp residue after the juice has been pressed from the fruit.

Grape pomace brandy may be designated as &quot;grappa&quot; or &quot;grappa brandy&quot;. Apple brandy may be referred to as &quot;applejack&quot;, although the process of &quot;jacking&quot; which was originally used in its production involved no distillation. There is also a product called &quot;grain brandy&quot; that is made from grain spirits.

Within particular jurisdictions, specific regulatory requirements regarding the labelling of products identified as brandy exist. For example:

* In the European Union, there are regulations that require products labelled as brandy, except &quot;grain brandy&quot;, to be produced exclusively from the distillation or redistillation of grape-based wine or grape-based &quot;wine fortified for distillation&quot; and aged a minimum of six months in oak. 
* In the US, a brandy that has been produced from other than grape wine must be labelled with a clarifying description of the type of brandy production, such as &quot;peach brandy&quot;, &quot;fruit brandy&quot;, &quot;dried fruit brandy&quot;, or &quot;pomace brandy&quot;, and brandy that has not been aged in oak for at least two years must be labelled as &quot;immature&quot;.
* In Canada, the regulations regarding naming conventions for brandy are similar to those of the US (provisions B.02.050–061). According to Canadian food and drug regulations, Brandy shall be a potable alcoholic distillate, or a mixture of potable alcoholic distillates, obtained by the distillation of wine. The minimum specified ageing period is six months in wood, although not necessarily oak (provision B.02.061.2). Caramel, fruit, other botanical substances, flavourings, and flavouring preparations may also be included in a product called brandy (provisions B.02.050–059).

Within the European Union, the German term &quot;Weinbrand&quot; is legally equivalent to the English term &quot;brandy&quot;, but outside the German-speaking countries, it is particularly used to designate brandy from Austria and Germany.

==Varieties and brands==

* Most American grape brandy production is situated in California. Popular brands include Christian Brothers, E&amp;J Gallo, Korbel, and Paul Masson.
*Ararat has been produced since 1877 and comes from the Ararat plain in the southern part of Armenia. Bottles on the market are aged anywhere from 3 to 20 years.
* In France:
** Armagnac is made from grapes of the Armagnac region in the southwest of France, Gers, Landes and Lot-et-Garonne. It is single-continuous distilled in a copper still and aged in oak casks from Gascony or Limousin or from the renowned Tronçais Forest in Auvergne. Armagnac was the first distilled spirit in France. Its usage was first mentioned in 1310 by Vital Du Four in a book of medicine recipes. Armagnacs have a specificity: they offer vintage qualities. Popular brands are Darroze, Baron de Sigognac, Larressingle, Delord, Laubade, Gélas and Janneau.
** Cognac comes from the Cognac region of France, and is double distilled using pot stills. Popular brands include Hine, Martell, Camus, Otard, Rémy Martin, Hennessy, Frapin, Delamain and Courvoisier. The European Union and some other countries legally enforce &quot;Cognac&quot; as the exclusive name for brandy produced and distilled in the Cognac area of France and the name &quot;Armagnac&quot; for brandy from the Gascony area of France. Both must also be made using traditional techniques. Since these are considered &quot;protected designations of origin&quot;, a brandy made elsewhere may not be called Cognac in these jurisdictions, even if it was made in an identical manner.
** is any high-quality brandy, including Cognac and Armagnac but also Fine de Bordeaux, Fine de Bourgogne, and Fine de la Marne.
* Cyprus brandy differs from other varieties in that its alcohol concentration is only 32% ABV (64 US proof).
* Greek brandy is distilled from Muscat wine. Mature distillates are made from sun-dried Savatiano, Sultana, and Black Corinth grape varieties blended with an aged Muscat wine.
* Brandy de Jerez originates from vineyards around Jerez de la Frontera in Andalusia, Spain. It is used in some sherries and is also available as a separate product. It has a protected designation of origin (PDO).
* Kanyak (or konyak) is a variety from Turkey, whose name is both a variation of &quot;cognac&quot; and means &quot;burn blood&quot; in Turkish, a reference to its use in cold weather.
* Portuguese Lourinhã region, just north of Lisbon, is one of the few European PDO that produce only brandy (&quot;aguardente vínica&quot;), together with Cognac, Armagnac and Jerez.
*In Moldova and Romania, grape brandy is colloquially called &quot;coniac&quot;, but is officially named &quot;Divin&quot; in Moldova and &quot;Vinars&quot; in Romania. After a double distillation, the beverage is usually aged in oak barrels and labelled according to its age (VS is a minimum of 3 years old, VSOP is a minimum of 5 years old, XO is a minimum of 7 years old, and XXO is a minimum of 20 years old).
*In Russia, brandy was first produced in 1885 at the Kizlyar Brandy Factory according to a recipe brought from France. Kizlyar brandy is produced according to the classic cognac technology and is one of the most popular beverages in Russia. Also in 2008, the factory restored the status of the Kremlin Suppliers Guild.
* South African brandies are, by law, made almost exactly as Cognac, using a double distillation process in copper pot stills followed by ageing in oak barrels for a minimum of three years. Because of this, South African brandies are considered very high quality.
* has been produced since the 1700s in the North of Italy, especially in Emilia-Romagna and Veneto, using grapes that are popular in winemaking such as Sangiovese and Grignolino. Colour, texture and finish resemble those of their French and Spanish counterparts. The most popular brands are , Stravecchio Branca, and . Northern Italy has also been noted since the Middle Ages for its pomace brandy, grappa, which is generally colourless but has some top-shelf varieties called &quot;barrique&quot; which are aged in oak casks and achieve the same caramel colour as regular brandies. There is a vast production of brandies and grappas in Italy, with more than 600 large, medium or small distilleries. Ticino, in Italian-speaking Switzerland, is also allowed to produce pomace brandy designated as grappa.

==Labelling of grades==
Brandy has a traditional age grading system, although its use is unregulated outside of Cognac and Armagnac. These indicators can usually be found on the label near the brand name:

* V.S. (&quot;very special&quot;) or ✯✯✯ (three stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy has been stored for at least two years in a cask.
* V.S.O.P. (&quot;very superior old pale&quot;), Reserve or ✯✯✯✯✯ (five stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is stored for at least four years in a cask.
* XO (&quot;extra old&quot;) or Napoléon designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is stored for at least six years.
* (&#x27;beyond age&#x27;) is a designation formally equal to XO for Cognac, but for Armagnac it designates brandy that is at least ten years old. In practice, the term is used by producers to market a high-quality product beyond the official age scale.

In the case of Brandy de Jerez, the classifies it according to:
* Brandy de Jerez Solera: 6 months old.
* Brandy de Jerez Solera Reserva: one year old.
* Brandy de Jerez Solera Gran Reserva: three years old.

Russian brandy (traditionally called &quot;Cognac&quot; within the country), as well as brandies from many other post-Soviet states, uses the traditional Russian grading system that is similar to the French one, but extends it significantly:
* &quot;Three stars&quot; or ✯✯✯ designates the brandy with the youngest component cask-aged for at least two years, analogous to the French V.S.
* &quot;Four stars&quot; or ✯✯✯✯ is for the blends where the youngest brandy is aged for at least three years.
* &quot;Five stars&quot; means that the youngest brandy in the blend was aged four years, similar to the French V.S.O.P.
* /KV (&quot;Aged Cognac&quot;) is a designation corresponding to &quot;XO&quot; or &quot;Napoléon&quot;, meaning that the youngest spirit in the blend is at least six years old.
* /KVVK (&quot;Aged Cognac, Superior Quality&quot;) designates the eight-year-old blends and tends to be used only for the highest quality vintages.
* /KS (&quot;Old Cognac&quot;): At least ten years of age for the youngest spirit in the blend (similar to the Armagnac&#x27;s &quot;&quot;).
* /OS (&quot;Very Old&quot;): Beyond the French system, designating blends older than 20 years.

<text>Carl Maria Friedrich Ernst von Weber (5 June 1826) was a German composer, conductor, virtuoso pianist, guitarist, and critic in the early Romantic period. Best known for his operas, he was a crucial figure in the development of German &quot;Romantische Oper&quot; (German Romantic opera).

Throughout his youth, his father, , relentlessly moved the family between Hamburg, Salzburg, Freiberg, Augsburg and Vienna. Consequently he studied with many teachers—his father, Johann Peter Heuschkel, Michael Haydn, Giovanni Valesi, Johann Nepomuk Kalcher, and Georg Joseph Vogler—under whose supervision he composed four operas, none of which survive complete. He had a modest output of non-operatic music, which includes two symphonies, two concertos and a concertino for clarinet and orchestra, a bassoon concerto, a horn concertino, two concertos and a Konzertstück for piano and orchestra, piano pieces such as &quot;Invitation to the Dance&quot;; and many pieces that featured the clarinet, usually written for the virtuoso clarinetist Heinrich Baermann.

His mature operas—&quot;Silvana&quot; (1810), &quot;Abu Hassan&quot; (1811), &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; (1821), &quot;Die drei Pintos&quot; ( 1820–21), &quot;Euryanthe&quot; (1823), &quot;Oberon&quot; (1826)—had a major impact on subsequent German composers including Marschner, Meyerbeer, and Wagner; his compositions for piano influenced those of Mendelssohn, Chopin and Liszt. His best known work, &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;, remains among the most significant German operas.

==Life and career==
===Childhood===
Carl Maria Friedrich Ernst von Weber was born around 18 November 1786 in Eutin, Bishopric of Lübeck. He was the eldest of the three children of Franz Anton von Weber and his second wife, Genovefa Weber, a Viennese singer. He was baptized Catholic on 20 November 1786 with the name Carl Friedrich Ernst; the alternative second name Maria appeared only later. His brother and sister died in infancy. Both parents were Catholic and originally came from the far south of Germany. The &quot;von&quot; was an affectation of his father&#x27;s, who was not an aristocrat and who claimed descent from a south German noble family which was already extinct at the time.

In April 1779, Franz Anton had been appointed director of the prince-bishopric orchestra, Eutin, which, however, was dissolved in 1781 because of spending cuts. He then took the position of Eutin&#x27;s municipal music director. Dissatisfied with this position, he resigned in 1787 and founded a theatre company in Hamburg. After a brief stay in Vienna, he joined the theatre company of Johann Friedrich Toscani (husband of Elisabeth Toscani) and Peter Carl Santorini, who performed in Kassel, Marburg, and Hofgeismar. He tried repeatedly to establish a lasting company of his own but had only intermittent success.

Franz Anton&#x27;s half-brother, , married Cäcilia Stamm and had four daughters—Josepha, Aloysia, Constanze, and Sophie—all of whom became notable singers. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart attempted to woo Aloysia, composing several pieces for her. After she rejected his advances, Mozart went on to marry Constanze; thus Mozart&#x27;s wife was a cousin of Carl Maria von Weber.

A gifted violinist, Franz Anton had ambitions of turning Weber into a child prodigy like Mozart. Weber was born with a congenital hip disorder and did not begin to walk until he was four. But by then, he was already a capable singer and pianist.

===Education===
Franz Anton gave Weber a comprehensive education, which was frequently interrupted by the family&#x27;s moves. In 1796, Weber continued his musical education in Hildburghausen, Thuringia, where he was instructed by the oboist Johann Peter Heuschkel. After moving to Salzburg in autumn 1797, Weber studied from 1798 with Michael Haydn, younger brother of the better-known Joseph Haydn, who agreed to teach Weber free of charge.

His time in Salzburg was overshadowed by the death of his mother Genovefa, who succumbed to tuberculosis on 13 March 1798, and that of his one-year-old sister Antonetta on 29 December 1798 in Munich. After the death of Carl&#x27;s mother, his paternal aunt Adelaide took over the care of him.

A visit to Joseph Haydn in Vienna, presumably in hope of advanced teaching, was fruitless. In autumn 1798, Weber moved to Munich where he studied singing with Johann Evangelist Wallishauser and composing with Johann Nepomuk Kalcher, who supervised Weber&#x27;s first opera, (&quot;The Power of Love and Wine&quot;). Like his other compositions of that period, this opera is lost. Six fughettas for piano of the twelve-year-old Weber were published in Leipzig.

Weber&#x27;s musical education was extended by a mastering of lithography which he learned in the workshop of Alois Senefelder (the inventor of the process) and Franz Gleißner (autumn 1799). A set of his &quot;Variations for the Pianoforte&quot; was lithographed by Weber himself.

In 1800, the family moved to Freiberg in Saxony, where Weber, then 14 years old, wrote an opera called &quot;Das stumme Waldmädchen&quot; (&quot;The Silent Forest Maiden&quot;). It was produced at the Freiberg and Chemnitz theatres and later in Saint Petersburg (1804), Vienna (1804/1805) and Prague (1806). The young Weber also began to publish articles as a music critic, for example in the &quot;Leipziger Neue Zeitung&quot; in 1801.

In 1801, the family returned to Salzburg, where Weber resumed his studies with Michael Haydn. Weber composed his third opera &quot;Peter Schmoll und seine Nachbarn&quot; (&quot;Peter Schmoll and His Neighbours&quot;) of which his teacher approved. After a concert tour in 1802 the Webers returned to Augsburg where it is believed &quot;Peter Schmoll&quot; premiered.

In mid 1803, Weber continued his studies in Vienna with Abbé Vogler, founder of important music schools in Mannheim, Stockholm, and Darmstadt. Another famous pupil of Vogler in Darmstadt was Jakob Meyer Beer, later known as Giacomo Meyerbeer, who became a close friend of Weber. In letters they addressed each other as &quot;brother&quot;.

===Early career 1804–1810===

Vogler recommended the 17-year-old Weber for the post of Director at the Breslau Opera in 1804; Weber was offered and accepted the post. He sought to reform the Opera by pensioning off older singers, expanding the orchestra, and tackling a more challenging repertoire. His ambitious and dedicated work as director of the orchestra was acknowledged, though his tempi were frequently criticized as too fast. As the daily routine did not leave sufficient time for his own creative work, Weber did not seek to extend his two-year appointment.

After an interlude at the court of Duke Eugen of Württemberg, who resided in Silesia, Weber served from 1807 to 1810 in Stuttgart as private secretary to Duke Ludwig, brother of King Frederick I of Württemberg. Weber&#x27;s time in Württemberg was plagued with troubles. He fell deeply into debt and became entangled in the financial manipulations of his employer, e.g. the sale of confirmations of ducal service which exempted the purchaser from military service. Weber was arrested and charged with embezzlement and bribery. As he could disprove the allegations, the case was brought under civil law to avoid compromising the &quot;de facto&quot; manipulator, the brother of the king. Weber agreed to pay the costs (the last payment was made in 1816) and was banished from Württemberg together with his father.

As a sobering side effect, Weber started to keep a diary to list his expenses and correspondence, and make occasional comments on special events.

Weber remained prolific as a composer during this period, writing a quantity of religious music, mainly for the Catholic mass. This, however, earned him the hostility of conservatives working for the re-establishment of traditional chant in liturgy. In his biography of Weber, Warrack notes that Weber was an accomplished guitarist. It was in this year that his first song with guitar accompaniment, &quot;Liebeszauber&quot;, was printed. Some of his most original and innovative songs were written during the following years, including &quot;Er an Sie&quot; (1808) and &quot;Was zieht zu deinem Zauberkreise&quot; (1809).

===Later career 1810–1826===
In 1810, Weber visited several cities throughout Germany; 1811 was a pivotal year in his career when he met and worked with the Munich court clarinetist Heinrich Baermann and composed the Concertino in E Major, Op. 26, J. 109, and the two concerti J. 114 and J. 118 for him; from December 1811 through March 1812, Weber went on tour with Baermann playing the clarinet works, and it was some of the final concerts on this tour that changed public, critical, and royal opinions of Weber&#x27;s work, and helped him to mount a successful performance of &quot;Silvana&quot; in Berlin later that year. 

From 1813 to 1816, he was director of the Opera in Prague; from 1816 to 1817 he worked in Berlin, and from 1817 onwards he was director of the prestigious Opera in Dresden, working hard to establish a German opera, in reaction to the Italian opera which had dominated the European music scene since the 18th century. He was inspired in this endeavour by the ideals of the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; period, and also by the German folk song collection &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot; by Arnim and Brentano. It was in 1816 that he wrote the Duet Op. 38 for guitar and piano, possibly inspired by similar works printed in Vienna by such composers as Hummel and Diabelli. On 4 November 1817, he married , a singer who created the title role of &quot;Silvana&quot;. In 1819, he wrote perhaps his most famous piano piece, &quot;Invitation to the Dance&quot;.

The successful premiere of &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; on 18 June 1821 in Berlin led to performances all over Europe. On the very morning of the premiere, Weber finished his &quot;Konzertstück in F minor for Piano and Orchestra&quot;, and he premiered it a week later.

In 1823, Weber composed his first (and only) full-length, through-composed opera &quot;Euryanthe&quot; to a libretto by Helmina von Chézy, several passages of which (notably the music for the villainous couple Lysiart and Eglantine) anticipate the early, romantic operas of Richard Wagner. In 1824, Weber received an invitation from The Royal Opera, London, to compose and produce &quot;Oberon&quot;, based on Christoph Martin Wieland&#x27;s poem of the same name. Weber accepted the invitation, and in 1826 he travelled to England, to finish the work and conduct the premiere on 12 April.

Weber was already suffering from tuberculosis when he visited London. He conducted the premiere and twelve sold-out performances of &quot;Oberon&quot; in London during April and in May, and despite his rapidly worsening health, he continued to fulfil commitments for private concerts and benefits.

He died in his sleep during the night on 5 June 1826 at the home of his good friend and host Sir George Smart; he was 39 years old. He was buried in London in the vaults beneath the Catholic Chapel at Moorfields, on 21 June 1826. Amongst the chief mourners were many notable musicians and theatre actors of the day including: Anton Furstenau who had accompanied Weber to London, Ignaz Moscheles, Christian Kramer, Charles Kemble, John Duruset, Johann Stumpff and James Planché.

Eighteen years later, in December 1844, his remains were transferred to the family burial plot in the Old Catholic Cemetery in Dresden at the side of his youngest son Alexander, who at the age of 19 had died of measles seven weeks before. The simple gravestone, designed by Gottfried Semper, lies against the northern boundary wall. Wagner composed a eulogy &quot;An Weber&#x27;s Grabe&quot; WWV 72 for the reburial. The piece for male choir a cappella was premiered on 16 December 1844 in Dresden. For this occasion Wagner also composed Funeral Music for Winds after Themes from &quot;Euryanthe&quot; of Weber, WWV 73.

Weber&#x27;s unfinished comic opera &quot;Die drei Pintos&quot; (&quot;The Three Pintos&quot;) was originally given by his widow to Meyerbeer for completion; it was eventually completed by Gustav Mahler, who conducted the first performance in Leipzig on 20 January 1888.

==Legacy==
Weber&#x27;s operas &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;, &quot;Euryanthe&quot;, and &quot;Oberon&quot; greatly influenced the development of the &quot;Romantische Oper&quot; (Romantic opera) in Germany. &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; came to be regarded as the first German opera, &quot;Euryanthe&quot; developed the &quot;leitmotif&quot; technique to an unprecedented degree, while &quot;Oberon&quot; may have influenced Mendelssohn&#x27;s music for &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and, at the same time, revealed Weber&#x27;s lifelong interest in the music of non-Western cultures. This interest was first manifested in Weber&#x27;s incidental music for Schiller&#x27;s translation of Gozzi&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot;, for which he used a Chinese melody, making him the first Western composer to use an Asian tune that was not of the pseudo-Turkish kind popularized by Mozart and others.
Weber&#x27;s compositions for clarinet, bassoon, and horn occupy an important place in the musical repertoire. His compositions for the clarinet, which include two concertos, a concertino, a quintet, a duo concertante, and variations on a theme from his opera &quot;Silvana&quot;, are regularly performed today. His Concertino for Horn and Orchestra requires the performer to simultaneously produce two notes by humming while playing—a technique known as &quot;multiphonics&quot;. His bassoon concerto and the &quot;Andante e Rondo ungarese&quot; (a reworking of a piece originally for viola and orchestra) are also popular with bassoonists.

Weber&#x27;s contribution to vocal and choral music is also significant. His body of Catholic religious music was highly popular in 19th-century Germany, and he composed one of the earliest song cycles, &quot;Die Temperamente beim Verluste der Geliebten&quot; (&quot;[Four] Temperaments on the Loss of a Lover&quot;). Weber was also notable as one of the first conductors to conduct without a piano or violin.

Weber&#x27;s orchestration has also been highly praised and emulated by later generations of composers—Berlioz referred to him several times in his &quot;Treatise on Instrumentation&quot; while Debussy remarked that the sound of the Weber orchestra was obtained through the scrutiny of the soul of each instrument.

His operas influenced the work of later opera composers, especially in Germany, such as Marschner, Meyerbeer, and Wagner, as well as several nationalist 19th-century composers such as Glinka. Homage has been paid to Weber by many 20th-century composers, such as Debussy and Stravinsky. Mahler completed Weber&#x27;s unfinished comic opera &quot;Die drei Pintos&quot; and made revisions of &quot;Euryanthe&quot; and &quot;Oberon&quot; while Hindemith composed the popular &quot;Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber&quot;, based on Weber&#x27;s lesser-known keyboard works and the incidental music to &quot;Turandot&quot;.

Weber also wrote music journalism and was interested in folksong, and learned lithography to engrave his own works.

A virtuoso pianist himself, Weber composed four sonatas, two concertos, and the &quot;Konzertstück in F minor&quot; (&quot;Concert Piece&quot;), which inspired composers such as Chopin, Liszt, and Mendelssohn. The &quot;&quot; provided a new model for the one-movement concerto in several contrasting sections (such as Liszt&#x27;s, who often played the work), and was acknowledged by Stravinsky as the model for his &quot;Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra&quot;. Weber&#x27;s shorter piano pieces, such as the &quot;Invitation to the Dance&quot;, were later orchestrated by Berlioz, while his &quot;Polacca Brillante&quot; was later set for piano and orchestra by Liszt. However, Weber&#x27;s piano music all but disappeared from the repertoire. There are several recordings of the major works for the solo piano, including complete recordings of the piano sonatas and the shorter piano pieces, and there are recordings of the individual sonatas by Claudio Arrau (1st sonata), Alfred Cortot and Emil Gilels (2nd sonata), Sviatoslav Richter (3rd sonata), and Leon Fleisher (4th sonata). The &quot;Invitation to the Dance&quot;, although better known in Berlioz&#x27;s orchestration (as part of the ballet music for a Paris production of &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;), has long been played and recorded by pianists (e.g., by Benno Moiseiwitsch [in Carl Tausig&#x27;s arrangement]). &quot;Invitation to the Dance&quot; also served as the thematic basis for Benny Goodman&#x27;s swing theme song for the radio program &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, the spaces are function spaces defined using a natural generalization of the -norm for finite-dimensional vector spaces. They are sometimes called Lebesgue spaces, named after Henri Lebesgue , although according to the Bourbaki group they were first introduced by Frigyes Riesz . 

 spaces form an important class of Banach spaces in functional analysis, and of topological vector spaces. Because of their key role in the mathematical analysis of measure and probability spaces, Lebesgue spaces are used also in the theoretical discussion of problems in physics, statistics, economics, finance, engineering, and other disciplines.
==Preliminaries==
===The -norm in finite dimensions===
The Euclidean length of a vector formula_1 in the formula_2-dimensional real vector space formula_3 is given by the Euclidean norm:
formula_4

The Euclidean distance between two points formula_5 and formula_6 is the length formula_7 of the straight line between the two points. In many situations, the Euclidean distance is appropriate for capturing the actual distances in a given space. In contrast, consider taxi drivers in a grid street plan who should measure distance not in terms of the length of the straight line to their destination, but in terms of the rectilinear distance, which takes into account that streets are either orthogonal or parallel to each other. The class of formula_8-norms generalizes these two examples and has an abundance of applications in many parts of mathematics, physics, and computer science.

For a real number formula_9 the formula_8-norm or formula_11-norm of formula_5 is defined by
formula_13
The absolute value bars can be dropped when formula_8 is a rational number with an even numerator in its reduced form, and formula_5 is drawn from the set of real numbers, or one of its subsets.

The Euclidean norm from above falls into this class and is the formula_16-norm, and the formula_17-norm is the norm that corresponds to the rectilinear distance.

The formula_18-norm or maximum norm (or uniform norm) is the limit of the formula_11-norms for formula_20, given by:
formula_21 
The formula_22-normed space is studied in functional analysis, probability theory, and harmonic analysis.

Another function was called the formula_22 &quot;norm&quot; by David Donoho—whose quotation marks warn that this function is not a proper norm—is the number of non-zero entries of the vector formula_24 Many authors abuse terminology by omitting the quotation marks. Defining formula_25 the zero &quot;norm&quot; of formula_5 is equal to
formula_27
This is not a norm because it is not homogeneous. For example, scaling the vector formula_5 by a positive constant does not change the &quot;norm&quot;. Despite these defects as a mathematical norm, the non-zero counting &quot;norm&quot; has uses in scientific computing, information theory, and statistics–notably in compressed sensing in signal processing and computational harmonic analysis. Despite not being a norm, the associated metric, known as Hamming distance, is a valid distance, since homogeneity is not required for distances.

== spaces and sequence spaces==

The formula_8-norm can be extended to vectors that have an infinite number of components (sequences), which yields the space formula_30 This contains as special cases:
* formula_31 the space of sequences whose series are absolutely convergent,
* formula_32 the space of square-summable sequences, which is a Hilbert space, and
* formula_33 the space of bounded sequences.

The space of sequences has a natural vector space structure by applying scalar addition and multiplication. Explicitly, the vector sum and the scalar action for infinite sequences of real (or complex) numbers are given by:
formula_34

Define the formula_8-norm:
formula_36

Here, a complication arises, namely that the series on the right is not always convergent, so for example, the sequence made up of only ones, formula_37 will have an infinite formula_8-norm for formula_39 The space formula_40 is then defined as the set of all infinite sequences of real (or complex) numbers such that the formula_8-norm is finite.

One can check that as formula_8 increases, the set formula_40 grows larger. For example, the sequence
formula_44
is not in formula_31 but it is in formula_40 for formula_47 as the series
formula_48
diverges for formula_49 (the harmonic series), but is convergent for formula_50

One also defines the formula_51-norm using the supremum:
formula_52
and the corresponding space formula_53 of all bounded sequences. It turns out that
formula_54
if the right-hand side is finite, or the left-hand side is infinite. Thus, we will consider formula_40 spaces for formula_56

The formula_8-norm thus defined on formula_40 is indeed a norm, and formula_40 together with this norm is a Banach space.

===General ℓ&quot;p&quot;-space===

In complete analogy to the preceding definition one can define the space formula_60 over a general index set formula_61 (and formula_62) as
formula_63
where convergence on the right means that only countably many summands are nonzero (see also Unconditional convergence).
With the norm
formula_64
the space formula_60 becomes a Banach space.
In the case where formula_61 is finite with formula_67 elements, this construction yields formula_3 with the formula_8-norm defined above.
If formula_61 is countably infinite, this is exactly the sequence space formula_40 defined above.
For uncountable sets formula_61 this is a non-separable Banach space which can be seen as the locally convex direct limit of formula_40-sequence spaces.

For formula_74 the formula_75-norm is even induced by a canonical inner product formula_76 called the &quot;&quot;, which means that formula_77 holds for all vectors formula_78 This inner product can expressed in terms of the norm by using the polarization identity. 
On formula_32 it can be defined by
formula_80
Now consider the case formula_81 Define
formula_82
where for all formula_5
formula_84

The index set formula_61 can be turned into a measure space by giving it the discrete σ-algebra and the counting measure. Then the space formula_60 is just a special case of the more general formula_11-space (defined below).

==&quot;Lp&quot; spaces and Lebesgue integrals==

An formula_11 space may be defined as a space of measurable functions for which the formula_8-th power of the absolute value is Lebesgue integrable, where functions which agree almost everywhere are identified. More generally, let formula_90 be a measure space and formula_56 
When formula_92, consider the set formula_93 of all measurable functions formula_94 from formula_95 to formula_96 or formula_97 whose absolute value raised to the formula_8-th power has a finite integral, or in symbols:
formula_99

To define the set for formula_100 recall that two functions formula_94 and formula_102 defined on formula_95 are said to be , written , if the set formula_104 is measurable and has measure zero. 
Similarly, a measurable function formula_94 (and its absolute value) is (or ) by a real number formula_106 written , if the (necessarily) measurable set formula_107 has measure zero. 
The space formula_108 is the set of all measurable functions formula_94 that are bounded almost everywhere (by some real formula_110) and formula_111 is defined as the infimum of these bounds:
formula_112 
When formula_113 then this is the same as the essential supremum of the absolute value of formula_94:
formula_115 

For example, if formula_94 is a measurable function that is equal to formula_117 almost everywhere then formula_118 for every formula_8 and thus formula_120 for all formula_121 

For every positive formula_122 the value under formula_123 of a measurable function formula_94 and its absolute value formula_125 are always the same (that is, formula_126 for all formula_8) and so a measurable function belongs to formula_93 if and only if its absolute value does. Because of this, many formulas involving formula_8-norms are stated only for non-negative real-valued functions. Consider for example the identity formula_130 which holds whenever formula_131 is measurable, formula_132 is real, and formula_133 (here formula_134 when formula_135). The non-negativity requirement formula_131 can be removed by substituting formula_137 in for formula_138 which gives formula_139 
Note in particular that when formula_140 is finite then the formula formula_141 relates the formula_8-norm to the formula_17-norm.

Each set of functions formula_93 forms a vector space when addition and scalar multiplication are defined pointwise. 
That the sum of two formula_8-th power integrable functions formula_94 and formula_102 is again formula_8-th power integrable follows from formula_150 
although it is also a consequence of &quot;Minkowski&#x27;s inequality&quot; 
formula_151 
which establishes that formula_152 satisfies the triangle inequality for formula_153 (the triangle inequality does not hold for formula_154). 
That formula_93 is closed under scalar multiplication is due to formula_152 being absolutely homogeneous, which means that formula_157 for every scalar formula_158 and every function formula_159 

Absolute homogeneity, the triangle inequality, and non-negativity are the defining properties of a seminorm. 
Thus formula_152 is a seminorm and the set formula_93 of formula_8-th power integrable functions together with the function formula_152 defines a seminormed vector space. In general, the seminorm formula_152 is not a norm because there might exist measurable functions formula_94 that satisfy formula_118 but are not equal to formula_117 (formula_152 is a norm if and only if no such formula_94 exists). 

Zero sets of formula_8-seminorms
If formula_94 is measurable and equals formula_117 a.e. then formula_118 for all positive formula_174
On the other hand, if formula_94 is a measurable function for which there exists some formula_133 such that formula_118 then formula_178 almost everywhere. When formula_8 is finite then this follows from the formula_49 case and the formula formula_141 mentioned above. 

Thus if formula_182 is positive and formula_94 is any measurable function, then formula_118 if and only if formula_178 almost everywhere. Since the right hand side (formula_178 a.e.) does not mention formula_122 it follows that all formula_152 have the same zero set (it does not depend on formula_8). So denote this common set by
formula_190
This set is a vector subspace of formula_93 for every positive formula_174 

Quotient vector space

Like every seminorm, the seminorm formula_152 induces a norm (defined shortly) on the canonical quotient vector space of formula_93 by its vector subspace 
formula_195
This normed quotient space is called and it is the subject of this article. We begin by defining the quotient vector space.

Given any formula_196 the coset formula_197 consists of all measurable functions formula_102 that are equal to formula_94 almost everywhere. 
The set of all cosets, typically denoted by 
formula_200
forms a vector space with origin formula_201 when vector addition and scalar multiplication are defined by formula_202 and formula_203 
This particular quotient vector space will be denoted by
formula_204
Two cosets are equal formula_205 if and only if formula_206 (or equivalently, formula_207), which happens if and only if formula_208 almost everywhere; if this is the case then formula_94 and formula_102 are identified in the quotient space. Hence, strictly speaking formula_211 consists of equivalence classes of functions.

The formula_8-norm on the quotient vector space

Given any formula_196 the value of the seminorm formula_152 on the coset formula_215 is constant and equal to formula_216 denote this unique value by formula_217 so that:
formula_218 
This assignment formula_219 defines a map, which will also be denoted by formula_220 on the quotient vector space 
formula_221
This map is a norm on formula_222 called the . 
The value formula_223 of a coset formula_224 is independent of the particular function formula_94 that was chosen to represent the coset, meaning that if formula_226 is any coset then formula_227 for every formula_228 (since formula_229 for every formula_228). 

The Lebesgue formula_11 space

The normed vector space formula_232 is called or the of formula_8-th power integrable functions and it is a Banach space for every formula_153 (meaning that it is a complete metric space, a result that is sometimes called the Riesz–Fischer theorem). 
When the underlying measure space formula_95 is understood then formula_222 is often abbreviated formula_237 or even just formula_238 
Depending on the author, the subscript notation formula_239 might denote either formula_222 or formula_241 

If the seminorm formula_152 on formula_93 happens to be a norm (which happens if and only if formula_244) then the normed space formula_245 will be linearly isometrically isomorphic to the normed quotient space formula_232 via the canonical map formula_247 (since formula_248); in other words, they will be, up to a linear isometry, the same normed space and so they may both be called &quot;formula_11 space&quot;.

The above definitions generalize to Bochner spaces. 

In general, this process cannot be reversed: there is no consistent way to define a &quot;canonical&quot; representative of each coset of formula_250 in formula_238 For formula_252 however, there is a theory of lifts enabling such recovery.

===Special cases===
For formula_153 the formula_40 spaces are a special case of formula_11 spaces; when formula_95 are the natural numbers formula_257 and formula_258 is the counting measure. More generally, if one considers any set formula_95 with the counting measure, the resulting formula_11 space is denoted formula_261 For example, formula_262 is the space of all sequences indexed by the integers, and when defining the formula_8-norm on such a space, one sums over all the integers. The space formula_264 where formula_2 is the set with formula_2 elements, is formula_3 with its formula_8-norm as defined above. 

Similar to formula_269 spaces, formula_270 is the only Hilbert space among formula_11 spaces. In the complex case, the inner product on formula_270 is defined by
formula_273
Functions in formula_270 are sometimes called square-integrable functions, quadratically integrable functions or square-summable functions, but sometimes these terms are reserved for functions that are square-integrable in some other sense, such as in the sense of a Riemann integral .

As any Hilbert space, every space formula_270 is linearly isometric to a suitable formula_276 where the cardinality of the set formula_61 is the cardinality of an arbitrary basis for this particular formula_278 

If we use complex-valued functions, the space formula_18 is a commutative C*-algebra with pointwise multiplication and conjugation. For many measure spaces, including all sigma-finite ones, it is in fact a commutative von Neumann algebra. An element of formula_18 defines a bounded operator on any formula_11 space by multiplication.

===When ===

If formula_282 then formula_283 can be defined as above, that is:
formula_284
In this case, however, the formula_8-norm formula_286 does not satisfy the triangle inequality and defines only a quasi-norm. The inequality formula_287 valid for formula_288 implies that
formula_289
and so the function
formula_290
is a metric on formula_291 The resulting metric space is complete.

In this setting formula_11 satisfies a &quot;reverse Minkowski inequality&quot;, that is for formula_293
formula_294

This result may be used to prove Clarkson&#x27;s inequalities, which are in turn used to establish the uniform convexity of the spaces formula_11 for formula_296 .

The space formula_11 for formula_154 is an F-space: it admits a complete translation-invariant metric with respect to which the vector space operations are continuous. It is the prototypical example of an F-space that, for most reasonable measure spaces, is not locally convex: in formula_40 or formula_300 every open convex set containing the formula_117 function is unbounded for the formula_8-quasi-norm; therefore, the formula_117 vector does not possess a fundamental system of convex neighborhoods. Specifically, this is true if the measure space formula_95 contains an infinite family of disjoint measurable sets of finite positive measure.

The only nonempty convex open set in formula_305 is the entire space. Consequently, there are no nonzero continuous linear functionals on formula_306 the continuous dual space is the zero space. In the case of the counting measure on the natural numbers (i.e. formula_307), the bounded linear functionals on formula_40 are exactly those that are bounded on formula_309, i.e., those given by sequences in formula_310 Although formula_40 does contain non-trivial convex open sets, it fails to have enough of them to give a base for the topology.

Having no linear functionals is highly undesirable for the purposes of doing analysis. In case of the Lebesgue measure on formula_312 rather than work with formula_11 for formula_282 it is common to work with the Hardy space whenever possible, as this has quite a few linear functionals: enough to distinguish points from one another. However, the Hahn–Banach theorem still fails in for formula_315 .

==Properties==

===Hölder&#x27;s inequality===

Suppose formula_316 satisfy formula_317. If formula_318 and formula_319 then formula_320 and 
formula_321

This inequality, called Hölder&#x27;s inequality, is in some sense optimal since if formula_322 and formula_94 is a measurable function such that
formula_324 
where the supremum is taken over the closed unit ball of formula_325 then formula_318 and
formula_327

===Generalized Minkowski inequality===

Minkowski inequality, which states that formula_152 satisfies the triangle inequality, can be generalized: 
If the measurable function formula_329 is non-negative (where formula_330 and formula_331 are measure spaces) then for all formula_332
formula_333

===Atomic decomposition===
If formula_62 then every non-negative formula_335 has an , meaning that there exist a sequence formula_336 of non-negative real numbers and a sequence of non-negative functions formula_337 called , whose supports formula_338 are pairwise disjoint sets of measure formula_339 such that
formula_340
and for every integer formula_341 
formula_342 
and
formula_343
and where moreover, the sequence of functions formula_344 depends only on formula_94 (it is independent of formula_8). 
These inequalities guarantee that formula_347 for all integers formula_2 while the supports of formula_349 being pairwise disjoint implies 
formula_350

An atomic decomposition can be explicitly given by first defining for every integer formula_341 
formula_352
and then letting
formula_353
where formula_354 denotes the measure of the set formula_355 and formula_356 denotes the indicator function of the set formula_357 
The sequence formula_358 is decreasing and converges to formula_117 as formula_360 Consequently, if formula_361 then formula_362 and formula_363 so that formula_364 is identically equal to formula_117 (in particular, the division formula_366 by formula_367 causes no issues). 

The complementary cumulative distribution function formula_368 of formula_369 that was used to define the formula_370 also appears in the definition of the weak formula_11-norm (given below) and can be used to express the formula_8-norm formula_152 (for formula_62) of formula_318 as the integral
formula_376
where the integration is with respect to the usual Lebesgue measure on formula_377

===Dual spaces===

The dual space of formula_283 for formula_296 has a natural isomorphism with formula_380 where formula_381 is such that formula_382. This isomorphism associates formula_383 with the functional formula_384 defined by
formula_385 
for every formula_386

formula_387 is a well defined continuous linear mapping which is an isometry by the extremal case of Hölder&#x27;s inequality. If formula_388 is a formula_389-finite measure space one can use the Radon–Nikodym theorem to show that any formula_390 can be expressed this way, i.e., formula_391 is an isometric isomorphism of Banach spaces. Hence, it is usual to say simply that formula_392 is the continuous dual space of formula_291

For formula_394 the space formula_283 is reflexive. Let formula_391 be as above and let formula_397 be the corresponding linear isometry. Consider the map from formula_283 to formula_399 obtained by composing formula_400 with the transpose (or adjoint) of the inverse of formula_401

formula_402

This map coincides with the canonical embedding formula_403 of formula_283 into its bidual. Moreover, the map formula_405 is onto, as composition of two onto isometries, and this proves reflexivity.

If the measure formula_258 on formula_95 is sigma-finite, then the dual of formula_408 is isometrically isomorphic to formula_409 (more precisely, the map formula_410 corresponding to formula_49 is an isometry from formula_409 onto formula_413

The dual of formula_409 is subtler. Elements of formula_415 can be identified with bounded signed &quot;finitely&quot; additive measures on formula_95 that are absolutely continuous with respect to formula_417 See ba space for more details. If we assume the axiom of choice, this space is much bigger than formula_408 except in some trivial cases. However, Saharon Shelah proved that there are relatively consistent extensions of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF + DC + &quot;Every subset of the real numbers has the Baire property&quot;) in which the dual of formula_53 is formula_420

===Embeddings===

Colloquially, if formula_421 then formula_222 contains functions that are more locally singular, while elements of formula_423 can be more spread out. Consider the Lebesgue measure on the half line formula_377 A continuous function in formula_425 might blow up near formula_117 but must decay sufficiently fast toward infinity. On the other hand, continuous functions in formula_18 need not decay at all but no blow-up is allowed. More formally, suppose that formula_428, then:

#formula_429 if and only if formula_95 does not contain sets of finite but arbitrarily large measure (e.g. any finite measure). 
#formula_431 if and only if formula_95 does not contain sets of non-zero but arbitrarily small measure (e.g. the counting measure).

Neither condition holds for the Lebesgue measure on the real line while both conditions holds for the counting measure on any finite set. As a consequence of the closed graph theorem, the embedding is continuous, i.e., the identity operator is a bounded linear map from formula_433 to formula_11 in the first case and formula_11 to formula_433 in the second. Indeed, if the domain formula_95 has finite measure, one can make the following explicit calculation using Hölder&#x27;s inequality
formula_438
leading to
formula_439

The constant appearing in the above inequality is optimal, in the sense that the operator norm of the identity formula_440 is precisely
formula_441
the case of equality being achieved exactly when formula_442 formula_258-almost-everywhere.

===Dense subspaces===

Let formula_62 and formula_90 be a measure space and consider an integrable simple function formula_94 on formula_95 given by
formula_448
where formula_449 are scalars, formula_450 has finite measure and formula_451 is the indicator function of the set formula_452 for formula_453 By construction of the integral, the vector space of integrable simple functions is dense in formula_454

More can be said when formula_95 is a normal topological space and formula_456 its Borel –algebra. 

Suppose formula_457 is an open set with formula_458 Then for every Borel set formula_459 contained in formula_460 there exist a closed set formula_461 and an open set formula_462 such that
formula_463
for every formula_464. Subsequently, there exists a Urysohn function formula_465 on formula_95 that is formula_17 on formula_461 and formula_117 on formula_470 with
formula_471

If formula_95 can be covered by an increasing sequence formula_473 of open sets that have finite measure, then the space of formula_8–integrable continuous functions is dense in formula_454 More precisely, one can use bounded continuous functions that vanish outside one of the open sets formula_476 

This applies in particular when formula_477 and when formula_258 is the Lebesgue measure. For example, the space of continuous and compactly supported functions as well as the space of integrable step functions are dense in formula_479.

===Closed subspaces===

If formula_480 is any positive real number, formula_258 is a probability measure on a measurable space formula_482 (so that formula_483), and formula_484 is a vector subspace, then formula_460 is a closed subspace of formula_283 if and only if formula_460 is finite-dimensional (formula_460 was chosen independent of formula_8). 
In this theorem, which is due to Alexander Grothendieck, it is crucial that the vector space formula_460 be a subset of formula_18 since it is possible to construct an infinite-dimensional closed vector subspace of formula_492 (which is even a subset of formula_493), where formula_494 is Lebesgue measure on the unit circle formula_495 and formula_496 is the probability measure that results from dividing it by its mass formula_497

==Applications==

===Statistics===

In statistics, measures of central tendency and statistical dispersion, such as the mean, median, and standard deviation, can be defined in terms of formula_11 metrics, and measures of central tendency can be characterized as solutions to variational problems.

In penalized regression, &quot;L1 penalty&quot; and &quot;L2 penalty&quot; refer to penalizing either the formula_425 norm of a solution&#x27;s vector of parameter values (i.e. the sum of its absolute values), or its squared formula_270 norm (its Euclidean length). Techniques which use an L1 penalty, like LASSO, encourage sparse solutions (where the many parameters are zero). Elastic net regularization uses a penalty term that is a combination of the formula_425 norm and the squared formula_270 norm of the parameter vector.

===Hausdorff–Young inequality===

The Fourier transform for the real line (or, for periodic functions, see Fourier series), maps formula_503 to formula_504 (or formula_505 to formula_506) respectively, where formula_507 and formula_508 This is a consequence of the Riesz–Thorin interpolation theorem, and is made precise with the Hausdorff–Young inequality.

By contrast, if formula_509 the Fourier transform does not map into formula_510

===Hilbert spaces===
Hilbert spaces are central to many applications, from quantum mechanics to stochastic calculus. The spaces formula_270 and formula_269 are both Hilbert spaces. In fact, by choosing a Hilbert basis formula_513 i.e., a maximal orthonormal subset of formula_270 or any Hilbert space, one sees that every Hilbert space is isometrically isomorphic to formula_515 (same formula_516 as above), i.e., a Hilbert space of type formula_517

==Generalizations and extensions==

===Weak ===

Let formula_90 be a measure space, and formula_94 a measurable function with real or complex values on formula_520 The distribution function of formula_94 is defined for formula_522 by
formula_523

If formula_94 is in formula_222 for some formula_8 with formula_527 then by Markov&#x27;s inequality,
formula_528

A function formula_94 is said to be in the space weak formula_222, or formula_531 if there is a constant formula_532 such that, for all formula_533
formula_534

The best constant formula_110 for this inequality is the formula_536-norm of formula_138 and is denoted by
formula_538

The weak formula_11 coincide with the Lorentz spaces formula_540 so this notation is also used to denote them.

The formula_536-norm is not a true norm, since the triangle inequality fails to hold. Nevertheless, for formula_94 in formula_543
formula_544
and in particular formula_545 

In fact, one has
formula_546
and raising to power formula_547 and taking the supremum in formula_548 one has
formula_549

Under the convention that two functions are equal if they are equal formula_258 almost everywhere, then the spaces formula_536 are complete .

For any formula_552 the expression
formula_553
is comparable to the formula_536-norm. Further in the case formula_47 this expression defines a norm if formula_556 Hence for formula_557 the weak formula_11 spaces are Banach spaces .

A major result that uses the formula_536-spaces is the Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem, which has broad applications to harmonic analysis and the study of singular integrals.

===Weighted spaces===

As before, consider a measure space formula_560 Let formula_561 be a measurable function. The formula_562-weighted formula_11 space is defined as formula_564 where formula_565 means the measure formula_566 defined by
formula_567

or, in terms of the Radon–Nikodym derivative, formula_568 the norm for formula_569 is explicitly
formula_570

As formula_11-spaces, the weighted spaces have nothing special, since formula_569 is equal to formula_573 But they are the natural framework for several results in harmonic analysis ; they appear for example in the Muckenhoupt theorem: for formula_394 the classical Hilbert transform is defined on formula_575 where formula_576 denotes the unit circle and formula_494 the Lebesgue measure; the (nonlinear) Hardy–Littlewood maximal operator is bounded on formula_578 Muckenhoupt&#x27;s theorem describes weights formula_562 such that the Hilbert transform remains bounded on formula_580 and the maximal operator on formula_581 

=== spaces on manifolds===

One may also define spaces formula_582 on a manifold, called the intrinsic formula_11 spaces of the manifold, using densities.

===Vector-valued spaces===

Given a measure space formula_584 and a locally convex space formula_516 (here assumed to be complete), it is possible to define spaces of formula_8-integrable formula_516-valued functions on formula_588 in a number of ways. One way is to define the spaces of Bochner integrable and Pettis integrable functions, and then endow them with locally convex TVS-topologies that are (each in their own way) a natural generalization of the usual formula_11 topology. Another way involves topological tensor products of formula_590 with formula_591 Element of the vector space formula_592 are finite sums of simple tensors formula_593 where each simple tensor formula_594 may be identified with the function formula_595 that sends formula_596 This tensor product formula_592 is then endowed with a locally convex topology that turns it into a topological tensor product, the most common of which are the projective tensor product, denoted by formula_598 and the injective tensor product, denoted by formula_599 In general, neither of these space are complete so their completions are constructed, which are respectively denoted by formula_600 and formula_601 (this is analogous to how the space of scalar-valued simple functions on formula_602 when seminormed by any formula_220 is not complete so a completion is constructed which, after being quotiented by formula_604 is isometrically isomorphic to the Banach space formula_605). Alexander Grothendieck showed that when formula_516 is a nuclear space (a concept he introduced), then these two constructions are, respectively, canonically TVS-isomorphic with the spaces of Bochner and Pettis integral functions mentioned earlier; in short, they are indistinguishable.

=== space of measurable functions===

The vector space of (equivalence classes of) measurable functions on formula_90 is denoted formula_608 . By definition, it contains all the formula_609 and is equipped with the topology of &quot;convergence in measure&quot;. When formula_258 is a probability measure (i.e., formula_611), this mode of convergence is named &quot;convergence in probability&quot;. The space formula_612 is always a topological abelian group but is only a topological vector space if formula_613 This is because scalar multiplication is continuous if and only if formula_613 If formula_388 is formula_389-finite then the weaker topology of local convergence in measure is an F-space, i.e. a completely metrizable topological vector space. Moreover, this topology is isometric to global convergence in measure formula_617 for a suitable choice of probability measure formula_618

The description is easier when formula_258 is finite. If formula_258 is a finite measure on formula_621 the formula_117 function admits for the convergence in measure the following fundamental system of neighborhoods
formula_623

The topology can be defined by any metric formula_624 of the form
formula_625
where formula_626 is bounded continuous concave and non-decreasing on formula_627 with formula_628 and formula_629 when formula_630 (for example, formula_631 Such a metric is called Lévy-metric for formula_632 Under this metric the space formula_612 is complete. However, as mentioned above, scalar multiplication is continuous with respect to this metric only if formula_634. To see this, consider the Lebesgue measurable function formula_635 defined by formula_636. Then clearly formula_637. The space formula_612 is in general not locally bounded, and not locally convex.

For the infinite Lebesgue measure formula_494 on formula_312 the definition of the fundamental system of neighborhoods could be modified as follows
formula_641

The resulting space formula_642, with the topology of local convergence in measure, is isomorphic to the space formula_643 for any positive formula_494–integrable density formula_645

<doc id="45196" wikidata="Q182003" url="?curid=45196" title="Injective function">
<text>In mathematics, an injective function (also known as injection, or one-to-one function ) is a function that maps distinct elements of its domain to distinct elements of its codomain; that is, implies (equivalently by contraposition, implies ). In other words, every element of the function&#x27;s codomain is the image of one element of its domain. The term must not be confused with that refers to bijective functions, which are functions such that each element in the codomain is an image of exactly one element in the domain. 

A homomorphism between algebraic structures is a function that is compatible with the operations of the structures. For all common algebraic structures, and, in particular for vector spaces, an is also called a . However, in the more general context of category theory, the definition of a monomorphism differs from that of an injective homomorphism. This is thus a theorem that they are equivalent for algebraic structures; see for more details.

A function formula_1 that is not injective is sometimes called many-to-one.

== Definition ==
Let formula_1 be a function whose domain is a set formula_3 The function formula_1 is said to be injective provided that for all formula_5 and formula_6 in formula_7 if formula_8 then formula_9; that is, formula_10 implies formula_11 Equivalently, if formula_12 then formula_13 in the contrapositive statement.

Symbolically,formula_14
which is logically equivalent to the contrapositive,formula_15An injective function (or, more generally, a monomorphism) is often denoted by using the specialized arrows ↣ or ↪ (for example, formula_16 or formula_17), although some authors specifically reserve ↪ for an inclusion map. 

== Examples ==
&quot;For visual examples, readers are directed to the gallery section.&quot;
* For any set formula_18 and any subset formula_19 the inclusion map formula_20 (which sends any element formula_21 to itself) is injective. In particular, the identity function formula_22 is always injective (and in fact bijective).
* If the domain of a function is the empty set, then the function is the empty function, which is injective.
* If the domain of a function has one element (that is, it is a singleton set), then the function is always injective.
* The function formula_23 defined by formula_24 is injective.
* The function formula_25 defined by formula_26 is injective, because (for example) formula_27 However, if formula_28 is redefined so that its domain is the non-negative real numbers [0,+∞), then formula_28 is injective.
* The exponential function formula_30 defined by formula_31 is injective (but not surjective, as no real value maps to a negative number).
* The natural logarithm function formula_32 defined by formula_33 is injective.
* The function formula_25 defined by formula_35 is not injective, since, for example, formula_36

More generally, when formula_18 and formula_38 are both the real line formula_39 then an injective function formula_23 is one whose graph is never intersected by any horizontal line more than once. This principle is referred to as the .

== Injections can be undone ==

Functions with left inverses are always injections. That is, given formula_41 if there is a function formula_42 such that for every formula_43, formula_44, then formula_1 is injective. In this case, formula_28 is called a retraction of formula_47 Conversely, formula_1 is called a section of formula_49

Conversely, every injection formula_1 with a non-empty domain has a left inverse formula_28. It can be defined by choosing an element formula_5 in the domain of formula_1 and setting formula_54 to the unique element of the pre-image formula_55 (if it is non-empty) or to formula_5 (otherwise).

The left inverse formula_28 is not necessarily an inverse of formula_58 because the composition in the other order, formula_59 may differ from the identity on formula_60 In other words, an injective function can be &quot;reversed&quot; by a left inverse, but is not necessarily invertible, which requires that the function is bijective.

== Injections may be made invertible ==

In fact, to turn an injective function formula_61 into a bijective (hence invertible) function, it suffices to replace its codomain formula_38 by its actual image formula_63 That is, let formula_64 such that formula_65 for all formula_43; then formula_28 is bijective. Indeed, formula_1 can be factored as formula_69 where formula_70 is the inclusion function from formula_71 into formula_60

More generally, injective partial functions are called partial bijections.

== Other properties ==
* If formula_1 and formula_28 are both injective then formula_75 is injective.
* If formula_76 is injective, then formula_1 is injective (but formula_28 need not be).
* formula_61 is injective if and only if, given any functions formula_80 formula_81 whenever formula_82 then formula_83 In other words, injective functions are precisely the monomorphisms in the category Set of sets.
* If formula_61 is injective and formula_85 is a subset of formula_7 then formula_87 Thus, formula_85 can be recovered from its image formula_89
* If formula_61 is injective and formula_85 and formula_92 are both subsets of formula_7 then formula_94
* Every function formula_95 can be decomposed as formula_96 for a suitable injection formula_1 and surjection formula_49 This decomposition is unique up to isomorphism, and formula_1 may be thought of as the inclusion function of the range formula_100 of formula_101 as a subset of the codomain formula_38 of formula_103
* If formula_61 is an injective function, then formula_38 has at least as many elements as formula_7 in the sense of cardinal numbers. In particular, if, in addition, there is an injection from formula_38 to formula_7 then formula_18 and formula_38 have the same cardinal number. (This is known as the Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem.)
* If both formula_18 and formula_38 are finite with the same number of elements, then formula_61 is injective if and only if formula_1 is surjective (in which case formula_1 is bijective).
* An injective function which is a homomorphism between two algebraic structures is an embedding.
* Unlike surjectivity, which is a relation between the graph of a function and its codomain, injectivity is a property of the graph of the function alone; that is, whether a function formula_1 is injective can be decided by only considering the graph (and not the codomain) of formula_47

== Proving that functions are injective ==

A proof that a function formula_1 is injective depends on how the function is presented and what properties the function holds.
For functions that are given by some formula there is a basic idea.
We use the definition of injectivity, namely that if formula_119 then formula_120

Here is an example: 
formula_121

Proof: Let formula_122 Suppose formula_123 So formula_124 implies formula_125 which implies formula_120 Therefore, it follows from the definition that formula_1 is injective.

There are multiple other methods of proving that a function is injective. For example, in calculus if formula_1 is a differentiable function defined on some interval, then it is sufficient to show that the derivative is always positive or always negative on that interval. In linear algebra, if formula_1 is a linear transformation it is sufficient to show that the kernel of formula_1 contains only the zero vector. If formula_1 is a function with finite domain it is sufficient to look through the list of images of each domain element and check that no image occurs twice on the list.

A graphical approach for a real-valued function formula_1 of a real variable formula_133 is the horizontal line test. If every horizontal line intersects the curve of formula_134 in at most one point, then formula_1 is injective or one-to-one.

<text>In mathematics, the concept of an inverse element generalises the concepts of opposite () and reciprocal () of numbers. 

Given an operation denoted here , and an identity element denoted , if , one says that is a left inverse of , and that is a right inverse of . (An identity element is an element such that and for all and for which the left-hand sides are defined.)

When the operation is associative, if an element has both a left inverse and a right inverse, then these two inverses are equal and unique; they are called the &quot;inverse element&quot; or simply the &quot;inverse&quot;. Often an adjective is added for specifying the operation, such as in additive inverse, multiplicative inverse, and functional inverse. In this case (associative operation), an invertible element is an element that has an inverse. In a ring, an &quot;invertible element&quot;, also called a unit, is an element that is invertible under multiplication (this is not ambiguous, as every element is invertible under addition).

Inverses are commonly used in groupswhere every element is invertible, and ringswhere invertible elements are also called units. They are also commonly used for operations that are not defined for all possible operands, such as inverse matrices and inverse functions. This has been generalized to category theory, where, by definition, an isomorphism is an invertible morphism.

The word &#x27;inverse&#x27; is derived from that means &#x27;turned upside down&#x27;, &#x27;overturned&#x27;. This may take its origin from the case of fractions, where the (multiplicative) inverse is obtained by exchanging the numerator and the denominator (the inverse of formula_1 is formula_2).

==Definitions and basic properties==
The concepts of &quot;inverse element&quot; and &quot;invertible element&quot; are commonly defined for binary operations that are everywhere defined (that is, the operation is defined for any two elements of its domain). However, these concepts are also commonly used with partial operations, that is operations that are not defined everywhere. Common examples are matrix multiplication, function composition and composition of morphisms in a category. It follows that the common definitions of associativity and identity element must be extended to partial operations; this is the object of the first subsections.

In this section, is a set (possibly a proper class) on which a partial operation (possibly total) is defined, which is denoted with formula_3 

===Associativity===
A partial operation is associative if 
:formula_4
for every in for which one of the members of the equality is defined; the equality means that the other member of the equality must also be defined.

Examples of non-total associative operations are multiplication of matrices of arbitrary size, and function composition.

===Identity elements===
Let formula_5 be a possibly partial associative operation on a set .

An &quot;identity element&quot;, or simply an &quot;identity&quot; is an element such that 
:formula_6
for every and for which the left-hand sides of the equalities are defined.

If and are two identity elements such that formula_7 is defined, then formula_8 (This results immediately from the definition, by formula_9)

It follows that a total operation has at most one identity element, and if and are different identities, then formula_7 is not defined. 

For example, in the case of matrix multiplication, there is one identity matrix for every positive integer , and two identity matrices of different size cannot be multiplied together.

Similarly, identity functions are identity elements for function composition, and the composition of the identity functions of two different sets are not defined.

===Left and right inverses===
If formula_11
where is an identity element, one says that is a &quot;left inverse&quot; of , and is a &quot;right inverse&quot; of .

Left and right inverses do not always exist, even when the operation is total and associative. For example, addition is a total associative operation on nonnegative integers, which has as additive identity, and is the only element that has an additive inverse. This lack of inverses is the main motivation for extending the natural numbers into the integers.

An element can have several left inverses and several right inverses, even when the operation is total and associative. For example, consider the functions from the integers to the integers. The &quot;doubling function&quot; formula_12 has infinitely many left inverses under function composition, which are the functions that divide by two the even numbers, and give any value to odd numbers. Similarly, every function that maps to either formula_13 or formula_14 is a right inverse of the function formula_15 the floor function that maps to formula_16 or formula_17 depending whether is even or odd.

More generally, a function has a left inverse for function composition if and only if it is injective, and it has a right inverse if and only if it is surjective. 

In category theory, right inverses are also called sections, and left inverses are called retractions.

===Inverses===
An element is &quot;invertible&quot; under an operation if it has a left inverse and a right inverse.

In the common case where the operation is associative, the left and right inverse of an element are equal and unique. Indeed, if and are respectively a left inverse and a right inverse of , then 
:formula_18

&quot;The inverse&quot; of an invertible element is its unique left or right inverse.

If the operation is denoted as an addition, the inverse, or additive inverse, of an element is denoted formula_19 Otherwise, the inverse of is generally denoted formula_20 or, in the case of a commutative multiplication formula_21 When there may be a confusion between several operations, the symbol of the operation may be added before the exponent, such as in formula_22 The notation formula_23 is not commonly used for function composition, since formula_24 can be used for the multiplicative inverse.

If and are invertible, and formula_25 is defined, then formula_25 is invertible, and its inverse is formula_27 

An invertible homomorphism is called an isomorphism. In 
category theory, an invertible morphism is also called an isomorphism.

==In groups==
A group is a set with an associative operation that has an identity element, and for which every element has an inverse. 

Thus, the inverse is a function from the group to itself that may also be considered as an operation of arity one. It is also an involution, since the inverse of the inverse of an element is the element itself.

A group may act on a set as transformations of this set. In this case, the inverse formula_28 of a group element formula_29 defines a transformation that is the inverse of the transformation defined by formula_30 that is, the transformation that &quot;undoes&quot; the transformation defined by formula_31

For example, the Rubik&#x27;s cube group represents the finite sequences of elementary moves. The inverse of such a sequence is obtained by applying the inverse of each move in the reverse order.

==In monoids==
A monoid is a set with an associative operation that has an identity element.

The &quot;invertible elements&quot; in a monoid form a group under monoid operation.

A ring is a monoid for ring multiplication. In this case, the invertible elements are also called units and form the group of units of the ring.

If a monoid is not commutative, there may exist non-invertible elements that have a left inverse or a right inverse (not both, as, otherwise, the element would be invertible). 

For example, the set of the functions from a set to itself is a monoid under function composition. In this monoid, the invertible elements are the bijective functions; the elements that have left inverses are the injective functions, and those that have right inverses are the surjective functions.

Given a monoid, one may want extend it by adding inverse to some elements. This is generally impossible for non-commutative monoids, but, in a commutative monoid, it is possible to add inverses to the elements that have the cancellation property (an element has the cancellation property if formula_32 implies formula_33 and formula_34 implies This extension of a monoid is allowed by Grothendieck group construction. This is the method that is commonly used for constructing integers from natural numbers, rational numbers from integers and, more generally, the field of fractions of an integral domain, and localizations of commutative rings.

==In rings==
A ring is an algebraic structure with two operations, &quot;addition&quot; and &quot;multiplication&quot;, which are denoted as the usual operations on numbers. 

Under addition, a ring is an abelian group, which means that addition is commutative and associative; it has an identity, called the additive identity, and denoted ; and every element has an inverse, called its additive inverse and denoted . Because of commutativity, the concepts of left and right inverses are meaningless since they do not differ from inverses.

Under multiplication, a ring is a monoid; this means that multiplication is associative and has an identity called the multiplicative identity and denoted . An &quot;invertible element &quot; for multiplication is called a unit. The inverse or multiplicative inverse (for avoiding confusion with additive inverses) of a unit is denoted formula_20 or, when the multiplication is commutative, formula_36

The additive identity is never a unit, except when the ring is the zero ring, which has as its unique element.

If is the only non-unit, the ring is a field if the multiplication is commutative, or a division ring otherwise.

In a noncommutative ring (that is, a ring whose multiplication is not commutative), a non-invertible element may have one or several left or right inverses. This is, for example, the case of the linear functions from an infinite-dimensional vector space to itself.

A commutative ring (that is, a ring whose multiplication is commutative) may be extended by adding inverses to elements that are not zero divisors (that is, their product with a nonzero element cannot be ). This is the process of localization, which produces, in particular, the field of rational numbers from the ring of integers, and, more generally, the field of fractions of an integral domain. Localization is also used with zero divisors, but, in this case the original ring is not a subring of the localisation; instead, it is mapped non-injectively to the localization.

==Matrices==
Matrix multiplication is commonly defined for matrices over a field, and straightforwardly extended to matrices over rings, rngs and semirings. However, &quot;in this section, only matrices over a commutative ring are considered&quot;, because of the use of the concept of rank and determinant.

If is a matrix (that is, a matrix with rows and columns), and is a matrix, the product is defined if , and only in this case. An identity matrix, that is, an identity element for matrix multiplication is a square matrix (same number for rows and columns) whose entries of the main diagonal are all equal to , and all other entries are .

An invertible matrix is an invertible element under matrix multiplication. A matrix over a commutative ring is invertible if and only if its determinant is a unit in (that is, is invertible in . In this case, its inverse matrix can be computed with Cramer&#x27;s rule. 

If is a field, the determinant is invertible if and only if it is not zero. As the case of fields is more common, one see often invertible matrices defined as matrices with a nonzero determinant, but this is incorrect over rings.

In the case of integer matrices (that is, matrices with integer entries), an invertible matrix is a matrix that has an inverse that is also an integer matrix. Such a matrix is called a unimodular matrix for distinguishing it from matrices that are invertible over the real numbers. A square integer matrix is unimodular if and only if its determinant is or , since these two numbers are the only units in the ring of integers.

A matrix has a left inverse if and only if its rank equals its number of columns. This left inverse is not unique except for square matrices where the left inverse equal the inverse matrix. Similarly, a right inverse exists if and only if the rank equals the number of rows; it is not unique in the case of a rectangular matrix, and equals the inverse matrix in the case of a square matrix.

==Functions, homomorphisms and morphisms==

Composition is a partial operation that generalizes to homomorphisms of algebraic structures and morphisms of categories into operations that are also called &quot;composition&quot;, and share many properties with function composition. 

In all the case, composition is associative.

If formula_37 and formula_38 the composition formula_39 is defined if and only if formula_40 or, in the function and homomorphism cases, formula_41 In the function and homomorphism cases, this means that the codomain of formula_42 equals or is included in the domain of . In the morphism case, this means that the codomain of formula_42 equals the domain of .

There is an &quot;identity&quot; formula_44 for every object (set, algebraic structure or object), which is called also an identity function in the function case.

A function is invertible if and only if it is a bijection. An invertible homomorphism or morphism is called an isomorphism. An homomorphism of algebraic structures is an isomorphism if and only if it is a bijection. The inverse of a bijection is called an inverse function. In the other cases, one talks of &quot;inverse isomorphisms&quot;.

A function has a left inverse or a right inverse if and only it is injective or surjective, respectively. An homomorphism of algebraic structures that has a left inverse or a right inverse is respectively injective or surjective, but the converse is not true in some algebraic structures. For example, the converse is true for vector spaces but not for modules over a ring: a homomorphism of modules that has a left inverse of a right inverse is called respectively a split epimorphism or a split monomorphism. This terminology is also used for morphisms in any category.

== Generalizations ==

=== In a unital magma ===
Let formula_45 be a unital magma, that is, a set with a binary operation formula_5 and an identity element formula_47. If, for formula_48, we have formula_49, then formula_50 is called a left inverse of formula_51 and formula_51 is called a right inverse of formula_50. If an element formula_54 is both a left inverse and a right inverse of formula_55, then formula_54 is called a two-sided inverse, or simply an inverse, of formula_55. An element with a two-sided inverse in formula_45 is called invertible in formula_45. An element with an inverse element only on one side is left invertible or right invertible.

Elements of a unital magma formula_60 may have multiple left, right or two-sided inverses. For example, in the magma given by the Cayley table

the elements 2 and 3 each have two two-sided inverses.

A unital magma in which all elements are invertible need not be a loop. For example, in the magma formula_60 given by the Cayley table

every element has a unique two-sided inverse (namely itself), but formula_60 is not a loop because the Cayley table is not a Latin square.

Similarly, a loop need not have two-sided inverses. For example, in the loop given by the Cayley table

the only element with a two-sided inverse is the identity element 1.

If the operation formula_5 is associative then if an element has both a left inverse and a right inverse, they are equal. In other words, in a monoid (an associative unital magma) every element has at most one inverse (as defined in this section). In a monoid, the set of invertible elements is a group, called the group of units of formula_45, and denoted by formula_65 or &quot;H&quot;1.

=== In a semigroup ===

The definition in the previous section generalizes the notion of inverse in group relative to the notion of identity. It&#x27;s also possible, albeit less obvious, to generalize the notion of an inverse by dropping the identity element but keeping associativity; that is, in a semigroup.

In a semigroup &quot;S&quot; an element &quot;x&quot; is called (von Neumann) regular if there exists some element &quot;z&quot; in &quot;S&quot; such that &quot;xzx&quot; = &quot;x&quot;; &quot;z&quot; is sometimes called a &quot;pseudoinverse&quot;. An element &quot;y&quot; is called (simply) an inverse of &quot;x&quot; if &quot;xyx&quot; = &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; = &quot;yxy&quot;. Every regular element has at least one inverse: if &quot;x&quot; = &quot;xzx&quot; then it is easy to verify that &quot;y&quot; = &quot;zxz&quot; is an inverse of &quot;x&quot; as defined in this section. Another easy to prove fact: if &quot;y&quot; is an inverse of &quot;x&quot; then &quot;e&quot; = &quot;xy&quot; and &quot;f&quot; = &quot;yx&quot; are idempotents, that is &quot;ee&quot; = &quot;e&quot; and &quot;ff&quot; = &quot;f&quot;. Thus, every pair of (mutually) inverse elements gives rise to two idempotents, and &quot;ex&quot; = &quot;xf&quot; = &quot;x&quot;, &quot;ye&quot; = &quot;fy&quot; = &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;e&quot; acts as a left identity on &quot;x&quot;, while &quot;f&quot; acts a right identity, and the left/right roles are reversed for &quot;y&quot;. This simple observation can be generalized using Green&#x27;s relations: every idempotent &quot;e&quot; in an arbitrary semigroup is a left identity for &quot;Re&quot; and right identity for &quot;Le&quot;. An intuitive description of this fact is that every pair of mutually inverse elements produces a local left identity, and respectively, a local right identity.

In a monoid, the notion of inverse as defined in the previous section is strictly narrower than the definition given in this section. Only elements in the Green class &quot;H&quot;1 have an inverse from the unital magma perspective, whereas for any idempotent &quot;e&quot;, the elements of &quot;H&quot;e have an inverse as defined in this section. Under this more general definition, inverses need not be unique (or exist) in an arbitrary semigroup or monoid. If all elements are regular, then the semigroup (or monoid) is called regular, and every element has at least one inverse. If every element has exactly one inverse as defined in this section, then the semigroup is called an inverse semigroup. Finally, an inverse semigroup with only one idempotent is a group. An inverse semigroup may have an absorbing element 0 because 000 = 0, whereas a group may not.

Outside semigroup theory, a unique inverse as defined in this section is sometimes called a quasi-inverse. This is generally justified because in most applications (for example, all examples in this article) associativity holds, which makes this notion a generalization of the left/right inverse relative to an identity (see Generalized inverse).

=== &quot;U&quot;-semigroups ===

A natural generalization of the inverse semigroup is to define an (arbitrary) unary operation ° such that (&quot;a&quot;°)° = &quot;a&quot; for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;S&quot;; this endows &quot;S&quot; with a type 2,1 algebra. A semigroup endowed with such an operation is called a &quot;U&quot;-semigroup. Although it may seem that &quot;a&quot;° will be the inverse of &quot;a&quot;, this is not necessarily the case. In order to obtain interesting notion(s), the unary operation must somehow interact with the semigroup operation. Two classes of &quot;U&quot;-semigroups have been studied:

* &quot;I&quot;-semigroups, in which the interaction axiom is &quot;aa&quot;°&quot;a&quot; = &quot;a&quot;
* *-semigroups, in which the interaction axiom is (&quot;ab&quot;)° = &quot;b&quot;°&quot;a&quot;°. Such an operation is called an involution, and typically denoted by &quot;a&quot;*

Clearly a group is both an &quot;I&quot;-semigroup and a *-semigroup. A class of semigroups important in semigroup theory are completely regular semigroups; these are &quot;I&quot;-semigroups in which one additionally has &quot;aa&quot;° = &quot;a&quot;°&quot;a&quot;; in other words every element has commuting pseudoinverse &quot;a&quot;°. There are few concrete examples of such semigroups however; most are completely simple semigroups. In contrast, a subclass of *-semigroups, the *-regular semigroups (in the sense of Drazin), yield one of best known examples of a (unique) pseudoinverse, the Moore–Penrose inverse. In this case however the involution &quot;a&quot;* is not the pseudoinverse. Rather, the pseudoinverse of &quot;x&quot; is the unique element &quot;y&quot; such that &quot;xyx&quot; = &quot;x&quot;, &quot;yxy&quot; = &quot;y&quot;, (&quot;xy&quot;)* = &quot;xy&quot;, (&quot;yx&quot;)* = &quot;yx&quot;. Since *-regular semigroups generalize inverse semigroups, the unique element defined this way in a *-regular semigroup is called the &quot;generalized inverse&quot; or &quot;Moore–Penrose inverse&quot;.

=== Semirings ===
=== Examples ===
All examples in this section involve associative operators.

==== Galois connections ====
The lower and upper adjoints in a (monotone) Galois connection, &quot;L&quot; and &quot;G&quot; are quasi-inverses of each other; that is, &quot;LGL&quot; = &quot;L&quot; and &quot;GLG&quot; = &quot;G&quot; and one uniquely determines the other. They are not left or right inverses of each other however.

==== Generalized inverses of matrices ====
A square matrix formula_66 with entries in a field formula_67 is invertible (in the set of all square matrices of the same size, under matrix multiplication) if and only if its determinant is different from zero. If the determinant of formula_66 is zero, it is impossible for it to have a one-sided inverse; therefore a left inverse or right inverse implies the existence of the other one. See invertible matrix for more.

More generally, a square matrix over a commutative ring formula_69 is invertible if and only if its determinant is invertible in formula_69.

Non-square matrices of full rank have several one-sided inverses:
* For formula_71 we have left inverses; for example, formula_72
* For formula_73 we have right inverses; for example, formula_74

The left inverse can be used to determine the least norm solution of formula_75, which is also the least squares formula for regression and is given by formula_76

No rank deficient matrix has any (even one-sided) inverse. However, the Moore–Penrose inverse exists for all matrices, and coincides with the left or right (or true) inverse when it exists.

As an example of matrix inverses, consider:

: formula_77

So, as &quot;m&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;, we have a right inverse, formula_78 By components it is computed as

: formula_79

The left inverse doesn&#x27;t exist, because

: formula_80

which is a singular matrix, and cannot be inverted.

<text>Universal algebra (sometimes called general algebra) is the field of mathematics that studies algebraic structures themselves, not examples (&quot;models&quot;) of algebraic structures.
For instance, rather than take particular groups as the object of study, in universal algebra one takes the class of groups as an object of study.

== Basic idea ==
In universal algebra, an (or algebraic structure) is a set &quot;A&quot; together with a collection of operations on &quot;A&quot;. 

=== Arity ===

An &quot;n&quot;-ary operation on &quot;A&quot; is a function that takes &quot;n&quot; elements of &quot;A&quot; and returns a single element of &quot;A&quot;. Thus, a 0-ary operation (or &quot;nullary operation&quot;) can be represented simply as an element of &quot;A&quot;, or a &quot;constant&quot;, often denoted by a letter like &quot;a&quot;. A 1-ary operation (or &quot;unary operation&quot;) is simply a function from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;A&quot;, often denoted by a symbol placed in front of its argument, like ~&quot;x&quot;. A 2-ary operation (or &quot;binary operation&quot;) is often denoted by a symbol placed between its arguments (also called infix notation), like &quot;x&quot; ∗ &quot;y&quot;. Operations of higher or unspecified &quot;arity&quot; are usually denoted by function symbols, with the arguments placed in parentheses and separated by commas, like &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;) or &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1...,&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;). One way of talking about an algebra, then, is by referring to it as an algebra of a certain type formula_1, where formula_1 is an ordered sequence of natural numbers representing the arity of the operations of the algebra. However, some researchers also allow infinitary operations, such as formula_3 where &quot;J&quot; is an infinite index set, which is an operation in the algebraic theory of complete lattices. 

=== Equations ===
After the operations have been specified, the nature of the algebra is further defined by axioms, which in universal algebra often take the form of identities, or equational laws. An example is the associative axiom for a binary operation, which is given by the equation &quot;x&quot; ∗ (&quot;y&quot; ∗ &quot;z&quot;) = (&quot;x&quot; ∗ &quot;y&quot;) ∗ &quot;z&quot;. The axiom is intended to hold for all elements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; of the set &quot;A&quot;.

== Varieties ==
A collection of algebraic structures defined by identities is called a variety or equational class.

Restricting one&#x27;s study to varieties rules out:
* quantification, including universal quantification (∀) except before an equation, and existential quantification (∃)
* logical connectives other than conjunction (∧)
* relations other than equality, in particular inequalities, both and order relations

The study of equational classes can be seen as a special branch of model theory, typically dealing with structures having operations only (i.e. the type can have symbols for functions but not for relations other than equality), and in which the language used to talk about these structures uses equations only.

Not all algebraic structures in a wider sense fall into this scope. For example, ordered groups involve an ordering relation, so would not fall within this scope.

The class of fields is not an equational class because there is no type (or &quot;signature&quot;) in which all field laws can be written as equations (inverses of elements are defined for all &quot;non-zero&quot; elements in a field, so inversion cannot be added to the type).

One advantage of this restriction is that the structures studied in universal algebra can be defined in any category that has &quot;finite products&quot;. For example, a topological group is just a group in the category of topological spaces.

=== Examples ===
Most of the usual algebraic systems of mathematics are examples of varieties, but not always in an obvious way, since the usual definitions often involve quantification or inequalities.

==== Groups ====
As an example, consider the definition of a group. Usually a group is defined in terms of a single binary operation ∗, subject to the axioms:
* Associativity (as in the previous section): &quot;x&quot; ∗ (&quot;y&quot; ∗ &quot;z&quot;)  =  (&quot;x&quot; ∗ &quot;y&quot;) ∗ &quot;z&quot;;   formally: ∀&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;. &quot;x&quot;∗(&quot;y&quot;∗&quot;z&quot;)=(&quot;x&quot;∗&quot;y&quot;)∗&quot;z&quot;.
* Identity element: There exists an element &quot;e&quot; such that for each element &quot;x&quot;, one has &quot;e&quot; ∗ &quot;x&quot;  =  &quot;x&quot;  =  &quot;x&quot; ∗ &quot;e&quot;;   formally: ∃&quot;e&quot; ∀&quot;x&quot;. &quot;e&quot;∗&quot;x&quot;=&quot;x&quot;=&quot;x&quot;∗&quot;e&quot;.
* Inverse element: The identity element is easily seen to be unique, and is usually denoted by &quot;e&quot;. Then for each &quot;x&quot;, there exists an element &quot;i&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; ∗ &quot;i&quot;  =  &quot;e&quot;  =  &quot;i&quot; ∗ &quot;x&quot;;   formally: ∀&quot;x&quot; ∃&quot;i&quot;. &quot;x&quot;∗&quot;i&quot;=&quot;e&quot;=&quot;i&quot;∗&quot;x&quot;.

(Some authors also use the &quot;closure&quot; axiom that &quot;x&quot; ∗ &quot;y&quot; belongs to &quot;A&quot; whenever &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; do, but here this is already implied by calling ∗ a binary operation.)

This definition of a group does not immediately fit the point of view of universal algebra, because the axioms of the identity element and inversion are not stated purely in terms of equational laws which hold universally &quot;for all ...&quot; elements, but also involve the existential quantifier &quot;there exists ...&quot;. The group axioms can be phrased as universally quantified equations by specifying, in addition to the binary operation ∗, a nullary operation &quot;e&quot; and a unary operation ~, with ~&quot;x&quot; usually written as &quot;x&quot;−1. The axioms become:
* Associativity: .
* Identity element: ;   formally: .
* Inverse element: ;   formally: .

To summarize, the usual definition has:
* a single binary operation (signature (2))
* 1 equational law (associativity)
* 2 quantified laws (identity and inverse)
while the universal algebra definition has:
* 3 operations: one binary, one unary, and one nullary (signature )
* 3 equational laws (associativity, identity, and inverse)
* no quantified laws (except outermost universal quantifiers, which are allowed in varieties)

A key point is that the extra operations do not add information, but follow uniquely from the usual definition of a group. Although the usual definition did not uniquely specify the identity element &quot;e&quot;, an easy exercise shows that it is unique, as is the inverse of each element.

The universal algebra point of view is well adapted to category theory. For example, when defining a group object in category theory, where the object in question may not be a set, one must use equational laws (which make sense in general categories), rather than quantified laws (which refer to individual elements). Further, the inverse and identity are specified as morphisms in the category. For example, in a topological group, the inverse must not only exist element-wise, but must give a continuous mapping (a morphism). Some authors also require the identity map to be a closed inclusion (a cofibration).

==== Other examples ====
Most algebraic structures are examples of universal algebras.
* Rings, semigroups, quasigroups, groupoids, magmas, loops, and others.
* Vector spaces over a fixed field and modules over a fixed ring are universal algebras. These have a binary addition and a family of unary scalar multiplication operators, one for each element of the field or ring.

Examples of relational algebras include semilattices, lattices, and Boolean algebras.

== Basic constructions ==
We assume that the type, formula_1, has been fixed. Then there are three basic constructions in universal algebra: homomorphic image, subalgebra, and product.

A homomorphism between two algebras &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; is a function from the set &quot;A&quot; to the set &quot;B&quot; such that, for every operation &quot;f&quot;&quot;A&quot; of &quot;A&quot; and corresponding &quot;f&quot;&quot;B&quot; of &quot;B&quot; (of arity, say, &quot;n&quot;), &quot;h&quot;(&quot;f&quot;&quot;A&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;)) = &quot;f&quot;&quot;B&quot;(&quot;h&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1), ..., &quot;h&quot;(&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;)). (Sometimes the subscripts on &quot;f&quot; are taken off when it is clear from context which algebra the function is from.) For example, if &quot;e&quot; is a constant (nullary operation), then &quot;h&quot;(&quot;e&quot;&quot;A&quot;) = &quot;e&quot;&quot;B&quot;. If ~ is a unary operation, then &quot;h&quot;(~&quot;x&quot;) = ~&quot;h&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). If ∗ is a binary operation, then &quot;h&quot;(&quot;x&quot; ∗ &quot;y&quot;) = &quot;h&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) ∗ &quot;h&quot;(&quot;y&quot;). And so on. A few of the things that can be done with homomorphisms, as well as definitions of certain special kinds of homomorphisms, are listed under &quot;Homomorphism&quot;. In particular, we can take the homomorphic image of an algebra, &quot;h&quot;(&quot;A&quot;).

A subalgebra of &quot;A&quot; is a subset of &quot;A&quot; that is closed under all the operations of &quot;A&quot;. A product of some set of algebraic structures is the cartesian product of the sets with the operations defined coordinatewise.

== Some basic theorems ==
* The isomorphism theorems, which encompass the isomorphism theorems of groups, rings, modules, etc.
* Birkhoff&#x27;s HSP Theorem, which states that a class of algebras is a variety if and only if it is closed under homomorphic images, subalgebras, and arbitrary direct products.

== Motivations and applications ==
In addition to its unifying approach, universal algebra also gives deep theorems and important examples and counterexamples. It provides a useful framework for those who intend to start the study of new classes of algebras.
It can enable the use of methods invented for some particular classes of algebras to other classes of algebras, by recasting the methods in terms of universal algebra (if possible), and then interpreting these as applied to other classes. It has also provided conceptual clarification; as J.D.H. Smith puts it, &quot;What looks messy and complicated in a particular framework may turn out to be simple and obvious in the proper general one.&quot;

In particular, universal algebra can be applied to the study of monoids, rings, and lattices. Before universal algebra came along, many theorems (most notably the isomorphism theorems) were proved separately in all of these classes, but with universal algebra, they can be proven once and for all for every kind of algebraic system.

The 1956 paper by Higgins referenced below has been well followed up for its framework for a range of particular algebraic systems, while his 1963 paper is notable for its discussion of algebras with operations which are only partially defined, typical examples for this being categories and groupoids. This leads on to the subject of higher-dimensional algebra which can be defined as the study of algebraic theories with partial operations whose domains are defined under geometric conditions. Notable examples of these are various forms of higher-dimensional categories and groupoids.

=== Constraint satisfaction problem ===
Universal algebra provides a natural language for the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). CSP refers to an important class of computational problems where, given a relational algebra &quot;A&quot; and an existential sentence formula_5 over this algebra, the question is to find out whether formula_5 can be satisfied in &quot;A&quot;. The algebra &quot;A&quot; is often fixed, so that CSP&quot;A&quot; refers to the problem whose instance is only the existential sentence formula_5.

It is proved that every computational problem can be formulated as CSP&quot;A&quot; for some algebra &quot;A&quot;.

For example, the &quot;n&quot;-coloring problem can be stated as CSP of the algebra , i.e. an algebra with &quot;n&quot; elements and a single relation, inequality.

The dichotomy conjecture (proved in April 2017) states that if &quot;A&quot; is a finite algebra, then CSP&quot;A&quot; is either P or NP-complete.

== Generalizations ==
Universal algebra has also been studied using the techniques of category theory. In this approach, instead of writing a list of operations and equations obeyed by those operations, one can describe an algebraic structure using categories of a special sort, known as Lawvere theories or more generally algebraic theories. Alternatively, one can describe algebraic structures using monads. The two approaches are closely related, with each having their own advantages.
In particular, every Lawvere theory gives a monad on the category of sets, while any &quot;finitary&quot; monad on the category of sets arises from a Lawvere theory. However, a monad describes algebraic structures within one particular category (for example the category of sets), while algebraic theories describe structure within any of a large class of categories (namely those having finite products).

A more recent development in category theory is operad theory – an operad is a set of operations, similar to a universal algebra, but restricted in that equations are only allowed between expressions with the variables, with no duplication or omission of variables allowed. Thus, rings can be described as the so-called &quot;algebras&quot; of some operad, but not groups, since the law duplicates the variable &quot;g&quot; on the left side and omits it on the right side. At first this may seem to be a troublesome restriction, but the payoff is that operads have certain advantages: for example, one can hybridize the concepts of ring and vector space to obtain the concept of associative algebra, but one cannot form a similar hybrid of the concepts of group and vector space.

Another development is partial algebra where the operators can be partial functions. Certain partial functions can also be handled by a generalization of Lawvere theories known as &quot;essentially algebraic theories&quot;.

Another generalization of universal algebra is model theory, which is sometimes described as &quot;universal algebra + logic&quot;.

== History ==
In Alfred North Whitehead&#x27;s book &quot;A Treatise on Universal Algebra,&quot; published in 1898, the term &quot;universal algebra&quot; had essentially the same meaning that it has today. Whitehead credits William Rowan Hamilton and Augustus De Morgan as originators of the subject matter, and James Joseph Sylvester with coining the term itself.

At the time structures such as Lie algebras and hyperbolic quaternions drew attention to the need to expand algebraic structures beyond the associatively multiplicative class. In a review Alexander Macfarlane wrote: &quot;The main idea of the work is not unification of the several methods, nor generalization of ordinary algebra so as to include them, but rather the comparative study of their several structures.&quot; At the time George Boole&#x27;s algebra of logic made a strong counterpoint to ordinary number algebra, so the term &quot;universal&quot; served to calm strained sensibilities.

Whitehead&#x27;s early work sought to unify quaternions (due to Hamilton), Grassmann&#x27;s Ausdehnungslehre, and Boole&#x27;s algebra of logic. Whitehead wrote in his book:
:&quot;Such algebras have an intrinsic value for separate detailed study; also they are worthy of comparative study, for the sake of the light thereby thrown on the general theory of symbolic reasoning, and on algebraic symbolism in particular. The comparative study necessarily presupposes some previous separate study, comparison being impossible without knowledge.&quot;

Whitehead, however, had no results of a general nature. Work on the subject was minimal until the early 1930s, when Garrett Birkhoff and Øystein Ore began publishing on universal algebras. Developments in metamathematics and category theory in the 1940s and 1950s furthered the field, particularly the work of Abraham Robinson, Alfred Tarski, Andrzej Mostowski, and their students.

In the period between 1935 and 1950, most papers were written along the lines suggested by Birkhoff&#x27;s papers, dealing with free algebras, congruence and subalgebra lattices, and homomorphism theorems. Although the development of mathematical logic had made applications to algebra possible, they came about slowly; results published by Anatoly Maltsev in the 1940s went unnoticed because of the war. Tarski&#x27;s lecture at the 1950 International Congress of Mathematicians in Cambridge ushered in a new period in which model-theoretic aspects were developed, mainly by Tarski himself, as well as C.C. Chang, Leon Henkin, Bjarni Jónsson, Roger Lyndon, and others.

In the late 1950s, Edward Marczewski emphasized the importance of free algebras, leading to the publication of more than 50 papers on the algebraic theory of free algebras by Marczewski himself, together with Jan Mycielski, Władysław Narkiewicz, Witold Nitka, J. Płonka, S. Świerczkowski, K. Urbanik, and others.

Starting with William Lawvere&#x27;s thesis in 1963, techniques from category theory have become important in universal algebra.

<text>Year 371 (CCCLXXI) was a common year starting on Saturday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Augustus and Petronius (or, less frequently, year 1124 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 371 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<text>Year 372 ([[Roman numerals|CCCLXXII]]) was a leap year starting on Sunday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Modestus and Arintheus (or, less frequently, year 1125 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 372 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<text>A submarine communications cable is a cable laid on the seabed between land-based stations to carry telecommunication signals across stretches of ocean and sea. The first submarine communications cables were laid beginning in the 1850s and carried telegraphy traffic, establishing the first instant telecommunications links between continents, such as the first transatlantic telegraph cable which became operational on 16 August 1858.

Submarine cables first connected all the world&#x27;s continents (except Antarctica) when Java was connected to Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia, in 1871 in anticipation of the completion of the Australian Overland Telegraph Line in 1872 connecting to Adelaide, South Australia and thence to the rest of Australia.

Subsequent generations of cables carried telephone traffic, then data communications traffic. These early cables used copper wires in their cores, but modern cables use optical fiber technology to carry digital data, which includes telephone, Internet and private data traffic. Modern cables are typically about in diameter and weigh around for the deep-sea sections which comprise the majority of the run, although larger and heavier cables are used for shallow-water sections near shore.

==Early history: telegraph and coaxial cables==
===First successful trials===
After William Cooke and Charles Wheatstone had introduced their working telegraph in 1839, the idea of a submarine line across the Atlantic Ocean began to be thought of as a possible triumph of the future. Samuel Morse proclaimed his faith in it as early as 1840, and in 1842, he submerged a wire, insulated with tarred hemp and India rubber, in the water of New York Harbor, and telegraphed through it. The following autumn, Wheatstone performed a similar experiment in Swansea Bay. A good insulator to cover the wire and prevent the electric current from leaking into the water was necessary for the success of a long submarine line. India rubber had been tried by Moritz von Jacobi, the Prussian electrical engineer, as far back as the early 19th century.

Another insulating gum which could be melted by heat and readily applied to wire made its appearance in 1842. Gutta-percha, the adhesive juice of the &quot;Palaquium gutta&quot; tree, was introduced to Europe by William Montgomerie, a Scottish surgeon in the service of the British East India Company. Twenty years earlier, Montgomerie had seen whips made of gutta-percha in Singapore, and he believed that it would be useful in the fabrication of surgical apparatus. Michael Faraday and Wheatstone soon discovered the merits of gutta-percha as an insulator, and in 1845, the latter suggested that it should be employed to cover the wire which was proposed to be laid from Dover to Calais. In 1847 William Siemens, then an officer in the army of Prussia, laid the first successful underwater cable using gutta percha insulation, across the Rhine between Deutz and Cologne. In 1849, Charles Vincent Walker, electrician to the South Eastern Railway, submerged of wire coated with gutta-percha off the coast from Folkestone, which was tested successfully.

===First commercial cables===
In August 1850, having earlier obtained a concession from the French government, John Watkins Brett&#x27;s English Channel Submarine Telegraph Company laid the first line across the English Channel, using the converted tugboat &quot;Goliath&quot;. It was simply a copper wire coated with gutta-percha, without any other protection, and was not successful. However, the experiment served to secure renewal of the concession, and in September 1851, a protected core, or true, cable was laid by the reconstituted Submarine Telegraph Company from a government hulk, &quot;Blazer&quot;, which was towed across the Channel.

In 1853, more successful cables were laid, linking Great Britain with Ireland, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and crossing The Belts in Denmark. The British &amp; Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company completed the first successful Irish link on May 23 between Portpatrick and Donaghadee using the collier &quot;William Hutt&quot;. The same ship was used for the link from Dover to Ostend in Belgium, by the Submarine Telegraph Company. Meanwhile, the Electric &amp; International Telegraph Company completed two cables across the North Sea, from Orford Ness to Scheveningen, the Netherlands. These cables were laid by &quot;Monarch&quot;, a paddle steamer which later became the first vessel with permanent cable-laying equipment.

In 1858, the steamship &quot;Elba&quot; was used to lay a telegraph cable from Jersey to Guernsey, on to Alderney and then to Weymouth, the cable being completed successfully in September of that year. Problems soon developed with eleven breaks occurring by 1860 due to storms, tidal and sand movements, and wear on rocks. A report to the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1860 set out the problems to assist in future cable-laying operations.

=== Crimean War (1853–1856) ===
In the Crimean War various forms of telegraphy played a major role; this was a first. At the start of the campaign there was a telegraph link at Bucharest connected to London. In the winter of 1854 the French extended the telegraph link to the Black Sea coast. In April 1855 the British laid an underwater cable from Varna to the Crimean peninsula so that news of the Crimean War could reach London in a handful of hours.

===Transatlantic telegraph cable===

The first attempt at laying a transatlantic telegraph cable was promoted by Cyrus West Field, who persuaded British industrialists to fund and lay one in 1858. However, the technology of the day was not capable of supporting the project; it was plagued with problems from the outset, and was in operation for only a month. Subsequent attempts in 1865 and 1866 with the world&#x27;s largest steamship, the SS &quot;Great Eastern&quot;, used a more advanced technology and produced the first successful transatlantic cable. &quot;Great Eastern&quot; later went on to lay the first cable reaching to India from Aden, Yemen, in 1870.

===British dominance of early cable===
From the 1850s until 1911, British submarine cable systems dominated the most important market, the North Atlantic Ocean. The British had both supply side and demand side advantages. In terms of supply, Britain had entrepreneurs willing to put forth enormous amounts of capital necessary to build, lay and maintain these cables. In terms of demand, Britain&#x27;s vast colonial empire led to business for the cable companies from news agencies, trading and shipping companies, and the British government. Many of Britain&#x27;s colonies had significant populations of European settlers, making news about them of interest to the general public in the home country.

British officials believed that depending on telegraph lines that passed through non-British territory posed a security risk, as lines could be cut and messages could be interrupted during wartime. They sought the creation of a worldwide network within the empire, which became known as the All Red Line, and conversely prepared strategies to quickly interrupt enemy communications. Britain&#x27;s very first action after declaring war on Germany in World War I was to have the cable ship &quot;Alert&quot; (not the CS &quot;Telconia&quot; as frequently reported) cut the five cables linking Germany with France, Spain and the Azores, and through them, North America. Thereafter, the only way Germany could communicate was by wireless, and that meant that Room 40 could listen in.

The submarine cables were an economic benefit to trading companies, because owners of ships could communicate with captains when they reached their destination and give directions as to where to go next to pick up cargo based on reported pricing and supply information. The British government had obvious uses for the cables in maintaining administrative communications with governors throughout its empire, as well as in engaging other nations diplomatically and communicating with its military units in wartime. The geographic location of British territory was also an advantage as it included both Ireland on the east side of the Atlantic Ocean and Newfoundland in North America on the west side, making for the shortest route across the ocean, which reduced costs significantly.

A few facts put this dominance of the industry in perspective. In 1896, there were 30 cable-laying ships in the world, 24 of which were owned by British companies. In 1892, British companies owned and operated two-thirds of the world&#x27;s cables and by 1923, their share was still 42.7 percent. During World War I, Britain&#x27;s telegraph communications were almost completely uninterrupted, while it was able to quickly cut Germany&#x27;s cables worldwide.

===Cable to India, Singapore, East Asia and Australia===
Throughout the 1860s and 1870s, British cable expanded eastward, into the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean. An 1863 cable to Bombay (now Mumbai), India, provided a crucial link to Saudi Arabia. In 1870, Bombay was linked to London via submarine cable in a combined operation by four cable companies, at the behest of the British Government. In 1872, these four companies were combined to form the mammoth globe-spanning Eastern Telegraph Company, owned by John Pender. A spin-off from Eastern Telegraph Company was a second sister company, the Eastern Extension, China and Australasia Telegraph Company, commonly known simply as &quot;the Extension.&quot; In 1872, Australia was linked by cable to Bombay via Singapore and China and in 1876, the cable linked the British Empire from London to New Zealand.

===Submarine cables across the Pacific, 1902-1991===
The first trans-Pacific cables providing telegraph service were completed in 1902 and 1903, linking the US mainland to Hawaii in 1902 and Guam to the Philippines in 1903. Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Fiji were also linked in 1902 with the trans-Pacific segment of the All Red Line. Japan was connected into the system in 1906. Service beyond Midway Atoll was abandoned in 1941 due to World War II, but the remainder stayed in operation until 1951 when the FCC gave permission to cease operations.

The first trans-Pacific telephone cable was laid from Hawaii to Japan in 1964, with an extension from Guam to The Philippines. Also in 1964, the Commonwealth Pacific Cable System (COMPAC), with 80 telephone channel capacity, opened for traffic from Sydney to Vancouver, and in 1967, the South East Asia Commonwealth (SEACOM) system, with 160 telephone channel capacity, opened for traffic. This system used microwave radio from Sydney to Cairns (Queensland), cable running from Cairns to Madang (Papua New Guinea), Guam, Hong Kong, Kota Kinabalu (capital of Sabah, Malaysia), Singapore, then overland by microwave radio to Kuala Lumpur. In 1991, the North Pacific Cable system was the first regenerative system (i.e., with repeaters) to completely cross the Pacific from the US mainland to Japan. The US portion of NPC was manufactured in Portland, Oregon, from 1989 to 1991 at STC Submarine Systems, and later Alcatel Submarine Networks. The system was laid by Cable &amp; Wireless Marine on the &quot;CS Cable Venture&quot;.

===Construction, 19-20th century===

Transatlantic cables of the 19th century consisted of an outer layer of iron and later steel wire, wrapping India rubber, wrapping gutta-percha, which surrounded a multi-stranded copper wire at the core. The portions closest to each shore landing had additional protective armour wires. Gutta-percha, a natural polymer similar to rubber, had nearly ideal properties for insulating submarine cables, with the exception of a rather high dielectric constant which made cable capacitance high. William Thomas Henley had developed a machine in 1837 for covering wires with silk or cotton thread that he developed into a wire wrapping capability for submarine cable with a factory in 1857 that became W.T. Henley&#x27;s Telegraph Works Co., Ltd. The India Rubber, Gutta Percha and Telegraph Works Company, established by the Silver family and giving that name to a section of London, furnished cores to Henley&#x27;s as well as eventually making and laying finished cable. In 1870 William Hooper established Hooper&#x27;s Telegraph Works to manufacture his patented vulcanized rubber core, at first to furnish other makers of finished cable, that began to compete with the gutta-percha cores. The company later expanded into complete cable manufacture and cable laying, including the building of the first cable ship specifically designed to lay transatlantic cables.

Gutta-percha and rubber were not replaced as a cable insulation until polyethylene was introduced in the 1930s. Even then, the material was only available to the military and the first submarine cable using it was not laid until 1945 during World War II across the English Channel. In the 1920s, the American military experimented with rubber-insulated cables as an alternative to gutta-percha, since American interests controlled significant supplies of rubber but did not have easy access to gutta-percha manufacturers. The 1926 development by John T. Blake of deproteinized rubber improved the impermeability of cables to water.

Many early cables suffered from attack by sea life. The insulation could be eaten, for instance, by species of &quot;Teredo&quot; (shipworm) and &quot;Xylophaga&quot;. Hemp laid between the steel wire armouring gave pests a route to eat their way in. Damaged armouring, which was not uncommon, also provided an entrance. Cases of sharks biting cables and attacks by sawfish have been recorded. In one case in 1873, a whale damaged the Persian Gulf Cable between Karachi and Gwadar. The whale was apparently attempting to use the cable to clean off barnacles at a point where the cable descended over a steep drop. The unfortunate whale got its tail entangled in loops of cable and drowned. The cable repair ship &quot;Amber Witch&quot; was only able to winch up the cable with difficulty, weighed down as it was with the dead whale&#x27;s body.

===Bandwidth problems===

Early long-distance submarine telegraph cables exhibited formidable electrical problems. Unlike modern cables, the technology of the 19th century did not allow for in-line repeater amplifiers in the cable. Large voltages were used to attempt to overcome the electrical resistance of their tremendous length but the cables&#x27; distributed capacitance and inductance combined to distort the telegraph pulses in the line, reducing the cable&#x27;s bandwidth, severely limiting the data rate for telegraph operation to 10–12 words per minute.

As early as 1816, Francis Ronalds had observed that electric signals were slowed in passing through an insulated wire or core laid underground, and outlined the cause to be induction, using the analogy of a long Leyden jar. The same effect was noticed by Latimer Clark (1853) on cores immersed in water, and particularly on the lengthy cable between England and The Hague. Michael Faraday showed that the effect was caused by capacitance between the wire and the earth (or water) surrounding it. Faraday had noticed that when a wire is charged from a battery (for example when pressing a telegraph key), the electric charge in the wire induces an opposite charge in the water as it travels along. In 1831, Faraday described this effect in what is now referred to as Faraday&#x27;s law of induction. As the two charges attract each other, the exciting charge is retarded. The core acts as a capacitor distributed along the length of the cable which, coupled with the resistance and inductance of the cable, limits the speed at which a signal travels through the conductor of the cable.

Early cable designs failed to analyse these effects correctly. Famously, E.O.W. Whitehouse had dismissed the problems and insisted that a transatlantic cable was feasible. When he subsequently became chief electrician of the Atlantic Telegraph Company, he became involved in a public dispute with William Thomson. Whitehouse believed that, with enough voltage, any cable could be driven. Thomson believed that his law of squares showed that retardation could not be overcome by a higher voltage. His recommendation was a larger cable. Because of the excessive voltages recommended by Whitehouse, Cyrus West Field&#x27;s first transatlantic cable never worked reliably, and eventually short circuited to the ocean when Whitehouse increased the voltage beyond the cable design limit.

Thomson designed a complex electric-field generator that minimized current by resonating the cable, and a sensitive light-beam mirror galvanometer for detecting the faint telegraph signals. Thomson became wealthy on the royalties of these, and several related inventions. Thomson was elevated to Lord Kelvin for his contributions in this area, chiefly an accurate mathematical model of the cable, which permitted design of the equipment for accurate telegraphy. The effects of atmospheric electricity and the geomagnetic field on submarine cables also motivated many of the early polar expeditions.

Thomson had produced a mathematical analysis of propagation of electrical signals into telegraph cables based on their capacitance and resistance, but since long submarine cables operated at slow rates, he did not include the effects of inductance. By the 1890s, Oliver Heaviside had produced the modern general form of the telegrapher&#x27;s equations, which included the effects of inductance and which were essential to extending the theory of transmission lines to the higher frequencies required for high-speed data and voice.

===Transatlantic telephony===
While laying a transatlantic telephone cable was seriously considered from the 1920s, the technology required for economically feasible telecommunications was not developed until the 1940s. A first attempt to lay a &quot;pupinized&quot; telephone cable—one with loading coils added at regular intervals—failed in the early 1930s due to the Great Depression.

TAT-1 (Transatlantic No. 1) was the first transatlantic telephone cable system. Between 1955 and 1956, cable was laid between Gallanach Bay, near Oban, Scotland and Clarenville, Newfoundland and Labrador, in Canada. It was inaugurated on September 25, 1956, initially carrying 36 telephone channels.

In the 1960s, transoceanic cables were coaxial cables that transmitted frequency-multiplexed voiceband signals. A high-voltage direct current on the inner conductor powered repeaters (two-way amplifiers placed at intervals along the cable). The first-generation repeaters remain among the most reliable vacuum tube amplifiers ever designed. Later ones were transistorized. Many of these cables are still usable, but have been abandoned because their capacity is too small to be commercially viable. Some have been used as scientific instruments to measure earthquake waves and other geomagnetic events.

===Other uses===
In 1942, Siemens Brothers of New Charlton, London, in conjunction with the United Kingdom National Physical Laboratory, adapted submarine communications cable technology to create the world&#x27;s first submarine oil pipeline in Operation Pluto during World War II.

Active fiber-optic cables may be useful in detecting seismic events which alter cable polarization.

==Modern history==
===Optical telecommunications cables===

In the 1980s, fiber-optic cables were developed. The first transatlantic telephone cable to use optical fiber was TAT-8, which went into operation in 1988. A fiber-optic cable comprises multiple pairs of fibers. Each pair has one fiber in each direction. TAT-8 had two operational pairs and one backup pair. Except for very short lines, fiber-optic submarine cables include repeaters at regular intervals.

Modern optical fiber repeaters use a solid-state optical amplifier, usually an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA). Each repeater contains separate equipment for each fiber. These comprise signal reforming, error measurement and controls. A solid-state laser dispatches the signal into the next length of fiber. The solid-state laser excites a short length of doped fiber that itself acts as a laser amplifier. As the light passes through the fiber, it is amplified. This system also permits wavelength-division multiplexing, which dramatically increases the capacity of the fiber. EDFA amplifiers were first used in submarine cables in 1995.

Repeaters are powered by a constant direct current passed down the conductor near the centre of the cable, so all repeaters in a cable are in series. Power feed equipment (PFE) is installed at the terminal stations. Typically both ends share the current generation with one end providing a positive voltage and the other a negative voltage. A virtual earth point exists roughly halfway along the cable under normal operation. The amplifiers or repeaters derive their power from the potential difference across them. The voltage passed down the cable is often anywhere from 3000 to 15,000VDC at a current of up to 1,100mA, with the current increasing with decreasing voltage; the current at 10,000VDC is up to 1,650mA. Hence the total amount of power sent into the cable is often up to 16.5 kW.

The optic fiber used in undersea cables is chosen for its exceptional clarity, permitting runs of more than between repeaters to minimize the number of amplifiers and the distortion they cause. Unrepeated cables are cheaper than repeated cables and their maximum transmission distance is limited, although this has increased over the years; in 2014 unrepeated cables of up to in length were in service; however these require unpowered repeaters to be positioned every 100 km.

The rising demand for these fiber-optic cables outpaced the capacity of providers such as AT&amp;T. Having to shift traffic to satellites resulted in lower-quality signals. To address this issue, AT&amp;T had to improve its cable-laying abilities. It invested $100 million in producing two specialized fiber-optic cable laying vessels. These included laboratories in the ships for splicing cable and testing its electrical properties. Such field monitoring is important because the glass of fiber-optic cable is less malleable than the copper cable that had been formerly used. The ships are equipped with thrusters that increase maneuverability. This capability is important because fiber-optic cable must be laid straight from the stern, which was another factor that copper-cable-laying ships did not have to contend with.

Originally, submarine cables were simple point-to-point connections. With the development of submarine branching units (SBUs), more than one destination could be served by a single cable system. Modern cable systems now usually have their fibers arranged in a self-healing ring to increase their redundancy, with the submarine sections following different paths on the ocean floor. One reason for this development was that the capacity of cable systems had become so large that it was not possible to completely back up a cable system with satellite capacity, so it became necessary to provide sufficient terrestrial backup capability. Not all telecommunications organizations wish to take advantage of this capability, so modern cable systems may have dual landing points in some countries (where back-up capability is required) and only single landing points in other countries where back-up capability is either not required, the capacity to the country is small enough to be backed up by other means, or having backup is regarded as too expensive.

A further redundant-path development over and above the self-healing rings approach is the mesh network whereby fast switching equipment is used to transfer services between network paths with little to no effect on higher-level protocols if a path becomes inoperable. As more paths become available to use between two points, it is less likely that one or two simultaneous failures will prevent end-to-end service.

As of 2012, operators had &quot;successfully demonstrated long-term, error-free transmission at 100 Gbps across Atlantic Ocean&quot; routes of up to , meaning a typical cable can move tens of terabits per second overseas. Speeds improved rapidly in the previous few years, with 40 Gbit/s having been offered on that route only three years earlier in August 2009.

Switching and all-by-sea routing commonly increases the distance and thus the round trip latency by more than 50%. For example, the round trip delay (RTD) or latency of the fastest transatlantic connections is under 60 ms, close to the theoretical optimum for an all-sea route. While in theory, a great circle route (GCP) between London and New York City is only , this requires several land masses (Ireland, Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island and the isthmus connecting New Brunswick to Nova Scotia) to be traversed, as well as the extremely tidal Bay of Fundy and a land route along Massachusetts&#x27; north shore from Gloucester to Boston and through fairly built up areas to Manhattan itself. In theory, using this partial land route could result in round trip times below 40 ms (which is the speed of light minimum time), and not counting switching. Along routes with less land in the way, round trip times can approach speed of light minimums in the long term.

The type of optical fiber used in unrepeated and very long cables is often PCSF (pure silica core) due to its low loss of 0.172dB per kilometer when carrying a 1550 nm wavelength laser light. The large chromatic dispersion of PCSF means that its use requires transmission and receiving equipment designed with this in mind; this property can also be used to reduce interference when transmitting multiple channels through a single fiber using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), which allows for multiple optical carrier channels to be transmitted through a single fiber, each carrying its own information. WDM is limited by the optical bandwidth of the amplifiers used to transmit data through the cable and by the spacing between the frequencies of the optical carriers; however this minimum spacing is also limited, with the minimum spacing often being 50 GHz (0.4 nm). The use of WDM can reduce the maximum length of the cable although this can be overcome by designing equipment with this in mind.

Optical post amplifiers, used to increase the strength of the signal generated by the optical transmitter often use a diode-pumped erbium-doped fiber laser. The diode is often a high power 980 or 1480 nm laser diode. This setup allows for an amplification of up to +24dBm in an affordable manner. Using an erbium-ytterbium doped fiber instead allows for a gain of +33dBm, however again the amount of power that can be fed into the fiber is limited. In single carrier configurations the dominating limitation is self phase modulation induced by the Kerr effect which limits the amplification to +18 dBm per fiber. In WDM configurations the limitation due to crossphase modulation becomes predominant instead. Optical pre-amplifiers are often used to negate the thermal noise of the receiver. Pumping the pre-amplifier with a 980 nm laser leads to a noise of at most 3.5 dB, with a noise of 5 dB usually obtained with a 1480 nm laser. The noise has to be filtered using optical filters.

Raman amplification can be used to extend the reach or the capacity of an unrepeatered cable, by launching 2 frequencies into a single fiber; one carrying data signals at 1550 nm, and the other pumping them at 1450 nm. Launching a pump frequency (pump laser light) at a power of just one watt leads to an increase in reach of 45 km or a 6-fold increase in capacity.

Another way to increase the reach of a cable is by using unpowered repeaters called remote optical pre-amplifiers (ROPAs); these still make a cable count as unrepeatered since the repeaters do not require electrical power but they do require a pump laser light to be transmitted alongside the data carried by the cable; the pump light and the data are often transmitted in physically separate fibers. The ROPA contains a doped fiber that uses the pump light (often a 1480 nm laser light) to amplify the data signals carried on the rest of the fibers.

WDM or wavelength division multiplexing was first implemented in submarine fiber optic cables from the 1990s to the 2000s, followed by DWDM or dense wavelength division mulltiplexing around 2007. Each fiber can carry 30 wavelengths at a time. SDM or spatial division multiplexing submarine cables have at least 12 fiber pairs which is an increase from the maximum of 8 pairs found in conventional submarine cables, and submarine cables with up to 24 fiber pairs have been deployed. The type of modulation employed in a submarine cable can have a major impact in its capacity. SDM is combined with DWDM to improve capacity.

Transponders are used to send data through the cable. The open cable concept allows for the design of a submarine cable independently of the transponders that will be used to transmit data through the cable. SLTE (Submarine Line Terminal Equipment) has transponders and a ROADM (Reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer) used for handling the signals in the cable via software control. The ROADM is used to improve the reliability of the cable by allowing it to operate even if it has faults. This equipment is located inside a cable landing station (CLS). C-OTDR (Coherent Optical Time Domain Reflectometry) is used in submarine cables to detect the location of cable faults. The wet plant of a submarine cable comprises the cable itself, branching units, repeaters and possibly OADMs (Optical add-drop multiplexers).

===Investment and finances===
A typical multi-terabit, transoceanic submarine cable system costs several hundred million dollars to construct. Almost all fiber-optic cables from TAT-8 in 1988 until approximately 1997 were constructed by consortia of operators. For example, TAT-8 counted 35 participants including most major international carriers at the time such as AT&amp;T Corporation. Two privately financed, non-consortium cables were constructed in the late 1990s, which preceded a massive, speculative rush to construct privately financed cables that peaked in more than $22 billion worth of investment between 1999 and 2001. This was followed by the bankruptcy and reorganization of cable operators such as Global Crossing, 360networks, FLAG, Worldcom, and Asia Global Crossing. Tata Communications&#x27; Global Network (TGN) is the only wholly owned fiber network circling the planet.

Most cables in the 20th century crossed the Atlantic Ocean, to connect the United States and Europe. However, capacity in the Pacific Ocean was much expanded starting in the 1990s. For example, between 1998 and 2003, approximately 70% of undersea fiber-optic cable was laid in the Pacific. This is in part a response to the emerging significance of Asian markets in the global economy.

After decades of heavy investment in already developed markets such as the transatlantic and transpacific routes, efforts increased in the 21st century to expand the submarine cable network to serve the developing world. For instance, in July 2009, an underwater fiber-optic cable line plugged East Africa into the broader Internet. The company that provided this new cable was SEACOM, which is 75% owned by East African and South African investors. The project was delayed by a month due to increased piracy along the coast.

Investments in cables present a commercial risk because cables cover 6,200 km of ocean floor, cross submarine mountain ranges and rifts. Because of this most companies only purchase capacity after the cable is finished.

===Antarctica===
Antarctica is the only continent not yet reached by a submarine telecommunications cable. Phone, video, and e-mail traffic must be relayed to the rest of the world via satellite links that have limited availability and capacity. Bases on the continent itself are able to communicate with one another via radio, but this is only a local network. To be a viable alternative, a fiber-optic cable would have to be able to withstand temperatures of as well as massive strain from ice flowing up to per year. Thus, plugging into the larger Internet backbone with the high bandwidth afforded by fiber-optic cable is still an as-yet infeasible economic and technical challenge in the Antarctic.

=== Arctic ===
The climate change induced melting of Arctic ice has provided the opportunity to lay new cable networks, linking continents and remote regions. Several projects are underway in the Arctic including 12,650 km &quot;Polar Express&quot; and 14,500 km Far North Fiber. However, scholars have raised environmental concerns about the laying of submarine cables in the region and the general lack of a nuanced regulatory framework. Environmental concerns pertain both to ice-related hazards damaging the cables, and cable installation disturbing the seabed or electromagnetic fields and thermal radiation of the cables impacting sensitive organisms.

== Importance of submarine cables ==
Submarine cables, while often perceived as ‘insignificant’ parts of communication infrastructure as they lay “hidden” in the seabed, are an essential infrastructure in the digital era, carrying 99% of the data traffic across the oceans. This data includes all internet traffic, military transmissions, and financial transactions.

The total carrying capacity of a submarine cable is in the terabits per second, while a satellite typically offers only 1 gigabit per second, a ratio of more than 1000 to 1. Satellites handle less than 5% - to an estimate of even 0.5% - of global data transmission, and are less efficient, slower, and more expensive. Therefore, satellites are often exclusively considered for remote areas with challenging conditions for laying submarine cables. Submarine cables are thus the essential technical infrastructure for all internet communication.

=== National security ===
As a result of these cables&#x27; cost and usefulness, they are highly valued not only by the corporations building and operating them for profit, but also by national governments. For instance, the Australian government considers its submarine cable systems to be &quot;vital to the national economy&quot;. Accordingly, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has created protection zones that restrict activities that could potentially damage cables linking Australia to the rest of the world. The ACMA also regulates all projects to install new submarine cables.

Due to their critical role, disruptions to these cables can lead to communication blackouts and, thus, extensive economic losses. The impact of such disruptions is often exemplified by the 2022 Tonga volcanic eruption that severed the island&#x27;s only submarine cable and thus connectivity to the rest of the world for several days. The cable break was declared a “national crisis,” and repairs took several weeks, leaving Tonga largely isolated during a crucial period for disaster response.

Submarine cable infrastructure may even have additional technical advantages, such as carrying SMART environmental sensors supporting national disaster early warning systems. Furthermore, the cables are predicted to become even more critical with growing demands from 5G networks, the ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT), and artificial intelligence on large data transfers.

=== International security ===
Submarine communication cables are a critical infrastructure within the context of international security. Transmitting massive amounts of sensitive data every day, they are essential for both state operations and private enterprises. One of the catalysts for the amount and sensitivity of data flowing through these cables has been the global rise of cloud computing.

The U.S military, for example, uses the submarine cable network for data transfer from conflict zones to command staff in the United States (U.S.). Interruption of the cable network during intense operations could have direct consequences for the military on the ground.

The criticality of cable services makes their geopolitical influence profound. Scholars argue that state dominance in cable networks can exert political pressure, or shape global internet governance.

An example of such state dominance in the global cable infrastructure is China’s ‘Digital Silk Road’ strategy funding the expansion of Chinese cable networks, with the Chinese company HMN Technologies often criticised for providing networks for other states, holding up to 10% of the global market share. Some critiques argue that Chinese investments in critical cable infrastructure, being involvement in approximately 25% of global submarine cables, such as the PEACE cable linking Eastafrica and Europe, may enable China to reroute data traffic through its own networks, and thus apply political pressure. The strategy is countered by the U.S., supporting alternative projects.

== Vulnerabilities of submarine cables to organized crime ==
Submarine cables are exposed to a variety of potential threats. Many of these threats are accidental, such as by fishing trawlers, ship anchors, earthquakes, turbidity currents, and even shark bites.

Based on surveying breaks in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, it was found that between 1959 and 1996, fewer than 9% were due to natural events. In response to this threat to the communications network, the practice of cable burial has developed. The average incidence of cable faults was 3.7 per per year from 1959 to 1979. That rate was reduced to 0.44 faults per 1,000 km per year after 1985, due to widespread burial of cable starting in 1980.

Still, cable breaks are by no means a thing of the past, with more than 50 repairs a year in the Atlantic Ocean alone, and significant breaks in 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2011.

Several vulnerabilities of submarine communication cables make them attractive targets for organized crime. The following section explores these vulnerabilities and currently proposed counter measures to organized crime from different perspectives.

=== Technical perspective ===

==== Technical vulnerabilities ====
The remoteness of these cables in international waters, poses significant challenges for continuous monitoring and increases their attractiveness as targets of physical tampering, data theft, and service disruptions.

The cables&#x27; vulnerability is further compounded by technological advancements, such as the development of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs), which enable covert cable damage while avoiding detection. However, even low-tech attacks can impact the cable&#x27;s security significantly, as demonstrated in 2013, when three divers were arrested for severing the main cable linking Egypt with Europe, drastically lowering Egypt&#x27;s internet speed. 

Even in shallow waters, cables remain exposed to risks, as illustrated in the context of the Korea Strait. Such sea passages are often marked as ‘maritime choke points’ where several nations have conflicting interests, increasing the risk of harm from shipping activities and disputes.

Further, most cable locations are publicly available, making them an easy target for criminal acts such as disrupting services or stealing cable materials, which potentially lead to substantial communication blackouts. The stealing of submarine cable has been reported in Vietnam, where more than 11 km of cables went missing in 2007 and were later presumed to be found on fishing boats, attributed to their incentives to sell them, according to media reports.

==== Technical countermeasures ====
Typically, cables are buried in waters with a depth of less than 2,000 meters, but increasingly, they are buried in deeper seabed as a means of protection against high seas fishing and bottom trawling. However, this may also be advantageous against physical attacks from organized crime.

Further technical solutions are advanced protective casings, and monitoring them with, e.g., UUVs. Such technical solutions, however, can be challenging to implement and are limited in the remote areas of the high sea. Other proposed solutions include spatial modelling through protective or safety zones and penalties, increasing resources for surveillance, and a more collaborative approach between states and the private sector. However, how to implement and enforce these solutions remains to be determined. The cables&#x27; remoteness thus complicates both physical attacks and their protection.

===== Cable repair =====
Shore stations can locate a break in a cable by electrical measurements, such as through spread-spectrum time-domain reflectometry (SSTDR), a type of time-domain reflectometry that can be used in live environments very quickly. Presently, SSTDR can collect a complete data set in 20ms. Spread spectrum signals are sent down the wire and then the reflected signal is observed. It is then correlated with the copy of the sent signal and algorithms are applied to the shape and timing of the signals to locate the break.

A cable repair ship will be sent to the location to drop a marker buoy near the break. Several types of grapples are used depending on the situation. If the sea bed in question is sandy, a grapple with rigid prongs is used to plough under the surface and catch the cable. If the cable is on a rocky sea surface, the grapple is more flexible, with hooks along its length so that it can adjust to the changing surface. In especially deep water, the cable may not be strong enough to lift as a single unit, so a special grapple that cuts the cable soon after it has been hooked is used and only one length of cable is brought to the surface at a time, whereupon a new section is spliced in. The repaired cable is longer than the original, so the excess is deliberately laid in a &quot;U&quot; shape on the seabed. A submersible can be used to repair cables that lie in shallower waters.

A number of ports near important cable routes became homes to specialized cable repair ships. Halifax, Nova Scotia, was home to a half dozen such vessels for most of the 20th century including long-lived vessels such as the CS &quot;Cyrus West Field&quot;, CS &quot;Minia&quot; and &quot;CS Mackay-Bennett&quot;. The latter two were contracted to recover victims from the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. The crews of these vessels developed many new techniques and devices to repair and improve cable laying, such as the &quot;plough&quot;.

=== Cybersecurity perspective ===

==== Cyber vulnerabilities ====
Increasingly, sophisticated cyber-attacks threaten the data traffic on the cables, with incentives ranging from financial gain, espionage, or extortion by either state actors or non-state actors. Further, hybrid warfare tactics can interfere with or even weaponize the data transferred by the cables. For example, low-intensity cyber-attacks can be employed for ransomware, data manipulation and theft, opening up new a new opportunity for the use of cybercrime and grey-zone tactics in interstate disputes.

The lack of binding international cybersecurity standards may create a gap in dealing with cyber-enabled sabotage, that can be used by organized crime. However, attributing an incident to a specific actor or motivation of such actor can be challenging, specifically in cyberspace.

==== Cyber espionage and Intelligence-gathering ====
The rising sophistication of cyberattacks underscores the vulnerability of submarine cables to cyberespionage, ultimately complicating their security. Techniques like cable tapping, hacking into network management systems, and targeting cable landing stations enable covert data access by intelligence agencies, with Russia, the U.S., and the United Kingdom (U.K.) noted as primary players.

These activities are driven by both strategic and economic motives, with advancements in technology making interception and data manipulation more effective and difficult to detect. Recent technological advancements increasing the vulnerability include the use of remote access portals and remote network management systems centralizing control over components, enabling attackers to monitor traffic and potentially disrupt data flows.

Intelligence-gathering techniques have been deployed since the late 19th century. Frequently at the beginning of wars, nations have cut the cables of the other sides to redirect the information flow into cables that were being monitored. The most ambitious efforts occurred in World War I, when British and German forces systematically attempted to destroy the others&#x27; worldwide communications systems by cutting their cables with surface ships or submarines.

During the Cold War, the United States Navy and National Security Agency (NSA) succeeded in placing wire taps on Soviet underwater communication lines in Operation Ivy Bells.

These historical intelligence-gathering techniques were eventually countered with technological advancements like the widespread use of end-to-end encryption minimizing the threat of wire tapping.

==== Cybersecurity countermeasures ====
Cybersecurity strategies for submarine cables, such as encryption, access controls, and continuous monitoring, primarily focus on preventing unauthorized data access but do not adequately address the physical protection of cables in vulnerable, remote, high-sea areas as stated above. 

As a result, while cybersecurity protocols are effective near coastal landing points, their enforcement across vast stretches of the open ocean becomes a challenge. To address these limitations, experts suggest a broader, multi-layered approach that integrates physical security measures with international cooperation and legal frameworks, especially given the jurisdictional ambiguities in international waters. 

Multilateral agreements to establish cybersecurity standards specific to submarine cables are highlighted as critical. These agreements can help bridge the jurisdictional ambiguities and often resulting enforcement gaps in international waters, which ultimately hinder effective protection and are frequently exploited by organized crime.

Some scholars advocate for heightened European Union (E.U.) coordination, recommending improvements in surveillance and response capabilities across various agencies, such as the Coast Guard and specific telecommunication regulators. Given the central role of private companies in cable ownership, some experts also underscore the need for stronger collaboration between governments and tech firms to pool resources and develop more innovative security measures tailored to this critical infrastructure.

=== Geopolitical perspective ===

==== Geopolitical vulnerabilities ====
Fishing vessels are the leading cause of accidental damage to submarine communication cables. However, some of the academic discussions and recent incidents point to geopolitical tactics influencing the cable&#x27;s security more than previously expected. These tactics include the ease and potential with which fishing vessels can blend into regular maritime traffic and implement their attacks.

The propensity for fishing trawler nets to cause cable faults may well have been exploited during the Cold War. For example, in February 1959, a series of 12 breaks occurred in five American trans-Atlantic communications cables. In response, a U.S. naval vessel, the USS &quot;Roy O. Hale&quot;, detained and investigated the Soviet trawler &quot;Novorosiysk&quot;. A review of the ship&#x27;s log indicated it had been in the region of each of the cables when they broke. Broken sections of cable were also found on the deck of the &quot;Novorosiysk&quot;. It appeared that the cables had been dragged along by the ship&#x27;s nets, and then cut once they were pulled up onto the deck to release the nets. The Soviet Union&#x27;s stance on the investigation was that it was unjustified, but the U.S. cited the Convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables of 1884 to which Russia had signed (prior to the formation of the Soviet Union) as evidence of violation of international protocol.

Several media outlets and organizations indicate that Russian fishing vessels, particularly in 2022, passed over a damaged submarine cable up to 20 times, suggesting potential political motives and the possibility of hybrid warfare tactics used from Russia&#x27;s side. Russian naval activities near submarine cables are often linked to increased hybrid warfare strategies targeting submarine cables, where sabotage is argued to serve as a tool to disrupt communication networks during conflict and destabilise adversaries. 

These tactics elevate cable security to a significant geopolitical issue. Criminal actors may further target cables as a means of economic warfare, aiming to destabilize economies or convey political messages. The disruption of submarine communication cables in highly politicised maritime areas thus has a significant political component that is receiving increased attention.

After two cable breaks in the Baltic Sea in November 2024, one between Lithuania and Sweden and the other between Finland and Germany, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius argued: 

&quot;“No one believes that these cables were cut accidentally. I also don&#x27;t want to believe in versions that these were ship anchors that accidentally caused the damage. Therefore, we have to state, without knowing specifically who it came from, that it is a &#x27;hybrid&#x27; action. And we also have to assume, without knowing it yet, that it is sabotage.&quot;&quot;  

This statement underlines the current discourse to recognize cable disruptions as threats to national securiy, which ultimately leads to their securitization in the international context.

==== Geopolitical risks and countermeasures ====
Submarine cables are inherently vulnerable to transnational threats like organized crime. International collaboration to address these threats tends to fall to existing organizations with a cable specific focus - such as the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) - which represent key submarine stakeholders, and play a vital role in promoting cooperation and information sharing among stakeholders. Such organizations are argued to be crucial to develop and implement a comprehensive and coordinated global strategy for cable security.

As of 2025, a tense U.S.-China relationship complicates this task especially in the South China Sea where there are territorial disputes. China has increasing control and influence over global cables networks, while both it and the USA financially supports allied-owned cable projects and exerts diplomatic pressure and regulatory action, e.g. against Vietnam. 

In light of Nord Stream pipelines sabotage in the Baltic Sea, where subsea infrastructure vital to Germany and Russia was physically destroyed, and other incidents there, NATO has increased patrols and monitoring operations.

=== Legal perspective ===

==== Legal vulnerabilities ====
Submarine cables are internationally regulated within the framework of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), in particular through the provisions of Articles 112 and 97, 112 and 115, which mandate operational freedom to lay cables in international waters and beyond the continental shelf and reward measures to protect against shipping accidents.

However, submarine cables face significant legal challenges and lack specific legal protection in UNCLOS and enforcement mechanisms against emerging threats, particular in international waters. This is further complicated by the non-ratification of the treaty by key states such as the U.S. and Turkey. Many countries lack explicit legal provisions to criminalize the destruction or theft of undersea cables, creating jurisdictional ambiguities that organized crime can exploit. Other legal frameworks, such as the 1884 Convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables are outdated and fail to address modern threats like cyberattacks and hybrid warfare tactics. The unclear jurisdiction and weak enforcement mechanisms, demonstrate the difficulty to protect submarine cables from organized crime.

The Arctic Ocean in particular exemplifies the challenges associated with surveillance and enforcement in vast and remote areas, leaving a legal vacuum that criminals may exploit. In the Arctic, the absence of a central international authority to oversee submarine cable protection and the reliance on military organizations like NATO hinders general coordinated global responses.

Organizations such as the ICPC thus highlight the need for updated and more comprehensive legal frameworks to ensure the security of submarine cables.

==== Legal countermeasures ====
The legal challenges of protecting submarine cables from organized crime have resulted in recommendations ranging from treaty amendments to domestic law reforms and multi-level governance models.

Some scholars argue that UNCLOS should be updated to protect cables extensively, including cooperative monitoring and enforcement protocols. Additionally, principles from the law of the sea, state responsibility, and the laws on the use of force could be creatively applied to strengthen protections for cables. Enforcement issues could be tackled by aligning domestic laws with UNCLOS, implementing national response protocols, and creating streamlined points of contact for cable incidents. Given the increased involvement of organizations like NATO, others recommend to clarify the roles of military and non-military actors in cable security and enhanced multi-level governance models.

While these proposed legal solutions seem promising, their practical implementation still remains a challenge due to the complexity of international treaties, the need for international cooperation, the lack of domestic criminalization of cable damage, and the evolving nature of technological threats. Additionally, while UNCLOS&#x27;s ambiguous jurisdiction in international waters hinders effective enforcement, limited political interests seems to hamper treaty development.

==Environmental impact ==

The presence of cables in the oceans can be a danger to marine life. With the proliferation of cable installations and the increasing demand for inter-connectivity that today&#x27;s society demands, the environmental impact is increasing.

Submarine cables can impact marine life in a number of ways.

=== Alteration of the seabed ===
Seabed ecosystems can be disturbed by the installation and maintenance of cables. The effects of cable installation are generally limited to specific areas. The intensity of disturbance depends on the installation method.

Cables are often laid in the so-called benthic zone of the seabed. The benthic zone is the ecological region at the bottom of the sea where benthos, clams and crabs live, and where the surface sediments, which are deposits of matter and particles in the water that provide a habitat for marine species, are located.

Sediment can be damaged by cable installation by trenching with water jets or ploughing. This can lead to reworking of the sediments, altering the substrate of which they are composed.

According to several studies, the biota of the benthic zone is only slightly affected by the presence of cables. However, the presence of cables can trigger behavioral disturbances in living organisms. The main observation is that the presence of cables provides a hard substrate for anemones attachment. These organisms are found in large number around cables that run through soft sediments, which are not normally suitable for these organisms. This is also the case for flatfish. Although little observed, the presence of cables can also change the water temperature and therefore disturb the surrounding natural habitat.

However, these disturbances are not very persistent over time, and can stabilize within a few days. Cable operators are trying to implement measures to route cables in such a way as to avoid areas with sensitive and vulnerable ecosystems.

=== Entanglement ===
Entanglement of marine animals in cables is one of the main causes of cable damage. Whales and sperm whales are the main animals that entangle themselves in cables and damage them. The encounter between these animals and cables can cause injury and sometimes death. Studies carried out between 1877 and 1955 reported 16 cable ruptures caused by whale entanglement, 13 of them by sperm whales. Between 1907 and 2006, 39 such events were recorded. Cable burial techniques are gradually being introduced to prevent such incidents.

=== The risk of fishing ===

Although submarine cables are located on the seabed, fishing activity can damage the cables. Fishermen using fishing techniques that involve scraping the seabed, or dragging equipment such as trawls or cages, can damage the cables, resulting in the loss of liquids and the chemical and toxic materials that make up the cables.

Areas with a high density of submarine cables have the advantage of being safer from fishing. At the expense of benthic and sedimentary zones, marine fauna is better protected in these maritime regions, thanks to limitations and bans. Studies have shown a positive effect on the fauna surrounding cable installation zones.

=== Pollution ===

Submarine cables are made of copper or optical fibers, surrounded by several protective layers of plastic, wire or synthetic materials. Cables can also be composed of dielectric fluids or hydrocarbon fluids, which act as electrical insulators. These substances can be harmful to marine life.

Fishing, aging cables and marine species that collide with or become entangled in cables can damage cables and spread toxic and harmful substances into the sea. However, the impact of submarine cables is limited compared with other sources of ocean pollution.

There is also a risk of releasing pollutants buried in sediments. When sediments are re-suspended due to the installation of cables, toxic substances such as hydrocarbons may be released.

Preliminary analyses can assess the level of sediment toxicity and select a cable route that avoids the remobilization and dispersion of sediment pollutants. And new, more modern techniques will make it possible to use less polluting materials for cable construction.

=== Sound waves and electromagnetic waves ===
The installation and maintenance of cables requires the use of machinery and equipment that can trigger sound waves or electromagnetic waves that can disturb animals that use waves to find their bearings in space or to communicate. Underwater sound waves depend on the equipment used, the characteristics of the seabed area where the cables are located, and the relief of the area.

Underwater noise and waves can modify the behavior of certain underwater species, such as migratory behavior, disrupting communication or reproduction. Available information is that underwater noise generated by submarine cable engineering operations has limited acoustic footprint and limited duration.

<text>A communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunication signals via a transponder; it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on Earth. Communications satellites are used for television, telephone, radio, internet, and military applications. Many communications satellites are in geostationary orbit above the equator, so that the satellite appears stationary at the same point in the sky; therefore the satellite dish antennas of ground stations can be aimed permanently at that spot and do not have to move to track the satellite. Others form satellite constellations in low Earth orbit, where antennas on the ground have to follow the position of the satellites and switch between satellites frequently.

The radio waves used for telecommunications links travel by line of sight and so are obstructed by the curve of the Earth. The purpose of communications satellites is to relay the signal around the curve of the Earth allowing communication between widely separated geographical points. Communications satellites use a wide range of radio and microwave frequencies. To avoid signal interference, international organizations have regulations for which frequency ranges or &quot;bands&quot; certain organizations are allowed to use. This allocation of bands minimizes the risk of signal interference.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
In October 1945, Arthur C. Clarke published an article titled &quot;Extraterrestrial Relays&quot; in the British magazine &quot;Wireless World&quot;. The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of artificial satellites in geostationary orbits to relay radio signals. Because of this, Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the inventor of the concept of the communications satellite, and the term &#x27;Clarke Belt&#x27; is employed as a description of the orbit.
The first artificial Earth satellite was Sputnik 1, which was put into orbit by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957. It was developed by Mikhail Tikhonravov and Sergey Korolev, building on work by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. Sputnik 1 was equipped with an on-board radio transmitter that worked on two frequencies of 20.005 and 40.002 MHz, or 7 and 15 meters wavelength. The satellite was not placed in orbit to send data from one point on Earth to another, but the radio transmitter was meant to study the properties of radio wave distribution throughout the ionosphere. The launch of Sputnik 1 was a major step in the exploration of space and rocket development, and marks the beginning of the Space Age.

=== Early active and passive satellite experiments ===
There are two major classes of communications satellites, &quot;passive&quot; and &quot;active&quot;. Passive satellites only reflect the signal coming from the source, toward the direction of the receiver. With passive satellites, the reflected signal is not amplified at the satellite, and only a small amount of the transmitted energy actually reaches the receiver. Since the satellite is so far above Earth, the radio signal is attenuated due to free-space path loss, so the signal received on Earth is very weak. Active satellites, on the other hand, amplify the received signal before retransmitting it to the receiver on the ground. Passive satellites were the first communications satellites, but are little used now.

Work that was begun in the field of electrical intelligence gathering at the United States Naval Research Laboratory in 1951 led to a project named Communication Moon Relay. Military planners had long shown considerable interest in secure and reliable communications lines as a tactical necessity, and the ultimate goal of this project was the creation of the longest communications circuit in human history, with the Moon, Earth&#x27;s natural satellite, acting as a passive relay. After achieving the first transoceanic communication between Washington, D.C., and Hawaii on 23 January 1956, this system was publicly inaugurated and put into formal production in January 1960.
The first satellite purpose-built to actively relay communications was Project SCORE, led by Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) and launched on 18 December 1958, which used a tape recorder to carry a stored voice message, as well as to receive, store, and retransmit messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The satellite also executed several realtime transmissions before the non-rechargeable batteries failed on 30 December 1958 after eight hours of actual operation.

The direct successor to SCORE was another ARPA-led project called Courier. Courier 1B was launched on 4 October 1960 to explore whether it would be possible to establish a global military communications network by using &quot;delayed repeater&quot; satellites, which receive and store information until commanded to rebroadcast them. After 17 days, a command system failure ended communications from the satellite.

NASA&#x27;s satellite applications program launched the first artificial satellite used for passive relay communications in Echo 1 on 12 August 1960. Echo 1 was an aluminized balloon satellite acting as a passive reflector of microwave signals. Communication signals were bounced off the satellite from one point on Earth to another. This experiment sought to establish the feasibility of worldwide broadcasts of telephone, radio, and television signals.

=== More firsts and further experiments ===

Telstar was the first active, direct relay communications commercial satellite and marked the first transatlantic transmission of television signals. Belonging to AT&amp;T as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&amp;T, Bell Telephone Laboratories, NASA, the British General Post Office, and the French National PTT (Post Office) to develop satellite communications, it was launched by NASA from Cape Canaveral on 10 July 1962, in the first privately sponsored space launch.

Another passive relay experiment primarily intended for military communications purposes was Project West Ford, which was led by Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s Lincoln Laboratory. After an initial failure in 1961, a launch on 9 May 1963 dispersed 350 million copper needle dipoles to create a passive reflecting belt. Even though only about half of the dipoles properly separated from each other, the project was able to successfully experiment and communicate using frequencies in the SHF X band spectrum.

An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was the Hughes Aircraft Company&#x27;s Syncom 2, launched on 26 July 1963. Syncom 2 was the first communications satellite in a geosynchronous orbit. It revolved around the Earth once per day at constant speed, but because it still had north–south motion, special equipment was needed to track it. Its successor, Syncom 3, launched on 19 July 1964, was the first geostationary communications satellite. Syncom 3 obtained a geosynchronous orbit, without a north–south motion, making it appear from the ground as a stationary object in the sky.

A direct extension of the passive experiments of Project West Ford was the Lincoln Experimental Satellite program, also conducted by the Lincoln Laboratory on behalf of the United States Department of Defense. The LES-1 active communications satellite was launched on 11 February 1965 to explore the feasibility of active solid-state X band long-range military communications. A total of nine satellites were launched between 1965 and 1976 as part of this series.

=== International commercial satellite projects ===

In the United States, 1962 saw the creation of the Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT) private corporation, which was subject to instruction by the US Government on matters of national policy. Over the next two years, international negotiations led to the Intelsat Agreements, which in turn led to the launch of Intelsat 1, also known as Early Bird, on 6 April 1965, and which was the first commercial communications satellite to be placed in geosynchronous orbit. Subsequent Intelsat launches in the 1960s provided multi-destination service and video, audio, and data service to ships at sea (Intelsat 2 in 1966–67), and the completion of a fully global network with Intelsat 3 in 1969–70. By the 1980s, with significant expansions in commercial satellite capacity, Intelsat was on its way to become part of the competitive private telecommunications industry, and had started to get competition from the likes of PanAmSat in the United States, which, ironically, was then bought by its archrival in 2005.

When Intelsat was launched, the United States was the only launch source outside of the Soviet Union, who did not participate in the Intelsat agreements. The Soviet Union launched its first communications satellite on 23 April 1965 as part of the Molniya program. This program was also unique at the time for its use of what then became known as the Molniya orbit, which describes a highly elliptical orbit, with two high apogees daily over the northern hemisphere. This orbit provides a long dwell time over Russian territory as well as over Canada at higher latitudes than geostationary orbits over the equator.

In the 2020s, the popularity of low Earth orbit satellite internet constellations providing relatively low-cost internet services led to reducing demand for new geostationary orbit communications satellites.

== Satellite orbits ==

Communications satellites usually have one of three primary types of orbit, while other orbital classifications are used to further specify orbital details. MEO and LEO are non-geostationary orbit (NGSO).
* Geostationary satellites have a &quot;geostationary orbit&quot; (GEO), which is from Earth&#x27;s surface. This orbit has the special characteristic that the apparent position of the satellite in the sky when viewed by a ground observer does not change, the satellite appears to &quot;stand still&quot; in the sky. This is because the satellite&#x27;s orbital period is the same as the rotation rate of the Earth. The advantage of this orbit is that ground antennas do not have to track the satellite across the sky, they can be fixed to point at the location in the sky the satellite appears.
* &quot;Medium Earth orbit&quot; (MEO) satellites are closer to Earth. Orbital altitudes range from above Earth.
* The region below medium orbits is referred to as &quot;low Earth orbit&quot; (LEO), and is about above Earth.

As satellites in MEO and LEO orbit the Earth faster, they do not remain visible in the sky to a fixed point on Earth continually like a geostationary satellite, but appear to a ground observer to cross the sky and &quot;set&quot; when they go behind the Earth beyond the visible horizon. Therefore, to provide continuous communications capability with these lower orbits requires a larger number of satellites, so that one of these satellites will always be visible in the sky for transmission of communication signals. However, due to their closer distance to the Earth, LEO or MEO satellites can communicate to ground with reduced latency and at lower power than would be required from a geosynchronous orbit.

=== Low Earth orbit (LEO) ===
A low Earth orbit (LEO) typically is a circular orbit about above the Earth&#x27;s surface and, correspondingly, a period (time to revolve around the Earth) of about 90 minutes.

Because of their low altitude, these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly from the sub-satellite point. In addition, satellites in low Earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly. So even for local applications, many satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity.

Low-Earth-orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and, due to proximity to the ground, do not require as high signal strength (signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source, so the effect is considerable). Thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost.

In addition, there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.

=== Satellite constellation ===
A group of satellites working in concert is known as a satellite constellation. Two such constellations, intended to provide satellite phone and low-speed data services, primarily to remote areas, are the Iridium and Globalstar systems. The Iridium system has 66 satellites, which orbital inclination of 86.4° and inter-satellite links provide service availability over the entire surface of Earth. Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by SpaceX, that aims for global satellite Internet access coverage.

It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low-Earth-orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part. This will be the case with the CASCADE system of Canada&#x27;s CASSIOPE communications satellite. Another system using this store and forward method is Orbcomm.

=== Medium Earth orbit (MEO) ===
A medium Earth orbit is a satellite in orbit somewhere between above the Earth&#x27;s surface. MEO satellites are similar to LEO satellites in functionality. MEO satellites are visible for much longer periods of time than LEO satellites, usually between 2 and 8 hours. MEO satellites have a larger coverage area than LEO satellites. A MEO satellite&#x27;s longer duration of visibility and wider footprint means fewer satellites are needed in a MEO network than a LEO network. One disadvantage is that a MEO satellite&#x27;s distance gives it a longer time delay and weaker signal than a LEO satellite, although these limitations are not as severe as those of a GEO satellite.

Like LEOs, these satellites do not maintain a stationary distance from the Earth. This is in contrast to the geostationary orbit, where satellites are always from Earth.

Typically the orbit of a medium Earth orbit satellite is about above Earth. In various patterns, these satellites make the trip around Earth in anywhere from 2 to 8 hours.

==== Examples of MEO ====
* In 1962, the communications satellite, Telstar, was launched. It was a medium Earth orbit satellite designed to help facilitate high-speed telephone signals. Although it was the first practical way to transmit signals over the horizon, its major drawback was soon realised. Because its orbital period of about 2.5 hours did not match the Earth&#x27;s rotational period of 24 hours, continuous coverage was impossible. It was apparent that multiple MEOs needed to be used in order to provide continuous coverage.
* In 2013, the first four of a constellation of 20 MEO satellites was launched. The O3b satellites provide broadband internet services, in particular to remote locations and maritime and in-flight use, and orbit at an altitude of ).

=== Geostationary orbit (GEO) ===

To an observer on Earth, a satellite in a gestationary orbit appears motionless, in a fixed position in the sky. This is because it revolves around the Earth at Earth&#x27;s own angular velocity (one revolution per sidereal day, in an equatorial orbit).

A geostationary orbit is useful for communications because ground antennas can be aimed at the satellite without their having to track the satellite&#x27;s motion. This is relatively inexpensive.

In applications that require many ground antennas, such as DirecTV distribution, the savings in ground equipment can more than outweigh the cost and complexity of placing a satellite into orbit.

==== Examples of GEO ====
* The first geostationary satellite was Syncom 3, launched on 19 August 1964, and used for communication across the Pacific starting with television coverage of the 1964 Summer Olympics. Shortly after Syncom 3, Intelsat I, aka &quot;Early Bird&quot;, was launched on 6 April 1965 and placed in orbit at 28° west longitude. It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the Atlantic Ocean.
* On 9 November 1972, Canada&#x27;s first geostationary satellite serving the continent, Anik A1, was launched by Telesat Canada, with the United States following suit with the launch of Westar 1 by Western Union on 13 April 1974.
* On 30 May 1974, the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be three-axis stabilized was launched: the experimental satellite ATS-6 built for NASA.
* After the launches of the Telstar through Westar 1 satellites, RCA Americom (later GE Americom, now SES) launched Satcom 1 in 1975. It was Satcom 1 that was instrumental in helping early cable TV channels such as WTBS (now TBS), HBO, CBN (now Freeform) and The Weather Channel become successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local cable TV headends using the satellite. Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States, like ABC, NBC, and CBS, to distribute programming to their local affiliate stations. Satcom 1 was widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 in America (24 transponders as opposed to the 12 of Westar 1), resulting in lower transponder-usage costs. Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers.
By 2000, Hughes Space and Communications (now Boeing Satellite Development Center) had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide. Other major satellite manufacturers include Space Systems/Loral, Orbital Sciences Corporation with the Star Bus series, Indian Space Research Organisation, Lockheed Martin (owns the former RCA Astro Electronics/GE Astro Space business), Northrop Grumman, Alcatel Space, now Thales Alenia Space, with the Spacebus series, and Astrium.

=== Molniya orbit ===
Geostationary satellites must operate above the equator and therefore appear lower on the horizon as the receiver gets farther from the equator. This will cause problems for extreme northerly latitudes, affecting connectivity and causing multipath interference (caused by signals reflecting off the ground and into the ground antenna).

Thus, for areas close to the North (and South) Pole, a geostationary satellite may appear below the horizon. Therefore, Molniya orbit satellites have been launched, mainly in Russia, to alleviate this problem.

Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. (Elevation is the extent of the satellite&#x27;s position above the horizon. Thus, a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees.)

The Molniya orbit is designed so that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for six to nine hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites (plus in-orbit spares) can provide uninterrupted coverage.

The first satellite of the Molniya series was launched on 23 April 1965 and was used for experimental transmission of TV signals from a Moscow uplink station to downlink stations located in Siberia and the Russian Far East, in Norilsk, Khabarovsk, Magadan and Vladivostok. In November 1967 Soviet engineers created a unique system of national TV network of satellite television, called Orbita, that was based on Molniya satellites.

=== Polar orbit ===
In the United States, the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) was established in 1994 to consolidate the polar satellite operations of
NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration)
NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). NPOESS manages a number of satellites for various purposes; for example, METSAT for meteorological satellite, EUMETSAT for the European branch of the program, and METOP for meteorological operations.

These orbits are Sun synchronous, meaning that they cross the equator at the same local time each day. For example, the satellites in the NPOESS (civilian) orbit will cross the equator, going from south to north, at times 1:30 P.M., 5:30 P.M., and 9:30 P.M.

=== Beyond geostationary orbit ===
There are plans and initiatives to bring dedicated communications satellite beyond geostationary orbits.
NASA proposed LunaNet as a data network aiming to provide a &quot;Lunar Internet&quot; for cis-lunar spacecraft and Installations.
The Moonlight Initiative is an equivalent ESA project that is stated to be compatible and providing navigational services for the lunar surface. Both programmes are satellite constellations of several satellites in various orbits around the Moon.

Other orbits are also planned to be used. Positions in the Earth-Moon-Libration points are also proposed for communication satellites covering the Moon alike communication satellites in geosynchronous orbit cover the Earth. Also, dedicated communication satellites in orbits around Mars supporting different missions on surface and other orbits are considered, such as the Mars Telecommunications Orbiter.

== Structure ==
Communications Satellites are usually composed of the following subsystems:
* Communication Payload, normally composed of transponders, antennas, amplifiers and switching systems
* Engines used to bring the satellite to its desired orbit
* A station keeping tracking and stabilization subsystem used to keep the satellite in the right orbit, with its antennas pointed in the right direction, and its power system pointed towards the Sun
* Power subsystem, used to power the Satellite systems, normally composed of solar cells, and batteries that maintain power during solar eclipse
* Command and Control subsystem, which maintains communications with ground control stations. The ground control Earth stations monitor the satellite performance and control its functionality during various phases of its life-cycle.

The bandwidth available from a satellite depends upon the number of transponders provided by the satellite. Each service (TV, Voice, Internet, radio) requires a different amount of bandwidth for transmission. This is typically known as link budgeting and a network simulator can be used to arrive at the exact value.

== Frequency allocation for satellite systems ==
Allocating frequencies to satellite services is a complicated process which requires international coordination and planning. This is carried out under the auspices of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
To facilitate frequency planning, the world is divided into three regions:
* Region 1: Europe, Africa, the Middle East, what was formerly the Soviet Union, and Mongolia
* Region 2: North and South America and Greenland
* Region 3: Asia (excluding region 1 areas), Australia, and the southwest Pacific

Within these regions, frequency bands are allocated to various satellite services, although a given service may be allocated different frequency bands in different regions. Some of the services provided by satellites are:
* Fixed satellite service (FSS)
* Broadcasting satellite service (BSS)
* Mobile-satellite service
* Radionavigation-satellite service
* Meteorological-satellite service

== Applications ==

=== Telephony ===

The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental long distance telephony. The fixed Public Switched Telephone Network relays telephone calls from land line telephones to an Earth station, where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite. The downlink follows an analogous path. Improvements in submarine communications cables through the use of fiber-optics caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century.

Satellite communications are still used in many applications today. Remote islands such as Ascension Island, Saint Helena, Diego Garcia, and Easter Island, where no submarine cables are in service, need satellite telephones. There are also regions of some continents and countries where landline telecommunications are rare to non existent, for example large regions of South America, Africa, Canada, China, Russia, and Australia. Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of Antarctica and Greenland. Other land use for satellite phones are rigs at sea, a backup for hospitals, military, and recreation. Ships at sea, as well as planes, often use satellite phones.

Satellite phone systems can be accomplished by a number of means. On a large scale, often there will be a local telephone system in an isolated area with a link to the telephone system in a main land area. There are also services that will patch a radio signal to a telephone system. In this example, almost any type of satellite can be used. Satellite phones connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-Earth-orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite teleport connected to the Public Switched Telephone Network .

=== Television ===

As television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large bandwidth to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats. Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct broadcast satellite (DBS), and Fixed Service Satellite (FSS).

The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct-to-home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS-class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS-class satellites. Examples of these are the Astra, Eutelsat, and Hotbird spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe.

Fixed Service Satellites use the C band, and the lower portions of the Ku band. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations (such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming, live shots, and backhauls), as well as being used for distance learning by schools and universities, business television (BTV), Videoconferencing, and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to cable television headends.

Free-to-air satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the Ku band. The Intelsat Americas 5, Galaxy 10R and AMC 3 satellites over North America provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their Ku band transponders.

The American Dish Network DBS service has also recently used FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their SuperDish antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the FCC&#x27;s &quot;must-carry&quot; regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry HDTV channels.

A direct broadcast satellite is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes (usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter). Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave Ku band. DBS technology is used for DTH-oriented (Direct-To-Home) satellite TV services, such as DirecTV, DISH Network and Orby TV in the United States, Bell Satellite TV and Shaw Direct in Canada, Freesat and Sky in the UK, Ireland, and New Zealand and DSTV in South Africa.

Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception (3 to 8 feet (1 to 2.5 m) in diameter for Ku band, and 12 feet (3.6 m) or larger for C band). They use linear polarization for each of the transponders&#x27; RF input and output (as opposed to circular polarization used by DBS satellites), but this is a minor technical difference that users do not notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of TVRO (Television Receive Only) receivers and dishes. It was also used in its Ku band form for the now-defunct Primestar satellite TV service.

Some satellites have been launched that have transponders in the Ka band, such as DirecTV&#x27;s SPACEWAY-1 satellite, and Anik F2. NASA and ISRO have also launched experimental satellites carrying Ka band beacons recently.

Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle (on which the antenna is mounted) is situated. These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some recreational vehicle owners. Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by JetBlue Airways for DirecTV (supplied by LiveTV, a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.

=== Radio broadcasting ===

Satellite radio offers audio broadcast services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services allow listeners to roam a continent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere.

A satellite radio or subscription radio (SR) is a digital radio signal that is broadcast by a communications satellite, which covers a much wider geographical range than terrestrial radio signals.

=== Amateur radio ===

Amateur radio operators have access to amateur satellites, which have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic. Most such satellites operate as spaceborne repeaters, and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with UHF or VHF radio equipment and highly directional antennas such as Yagis or dish antennas. Due to launch costs, most current amateur satellites are launched into fairly low Earth orbits, and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time. Some satellites also provide data-forwarding services using the X.25 or similar protocols.

=== Internet access ===

After the 1990s, satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the Internet via broadband data connections. This can be very useful for users who are located in remote areas, and cannot access a broadband connection, or require high availability of services.

=== Military ===
Communications satellites are used for military communications applications, such as Global Command and Control Systems. Examples of military systems that use communication satellites are the MILSTAR, the DSCS, and the FLTSATCOM of the United States, NATO satellites, United Kingdom satellites (for instance Skynet), and satellites of the former Soviet Union. India has launched its first Military Communication satellite GSAT-7, its transponders operate in UHF, F, C and bands. Typically military satellites operate in the UHF, SHF (also known as X-band) or EHF (also known as Ka band) frequency bands.

=== Data collection ===
Near-ground in situ environmental monitoring equipment (such as tide gauges, weather stations, weather buoys, and radiosondes), may use satellites for one-way data transmission or two-way telemetry and telecontrol. It may be based on a secondary payload of a weather satellite (as in the case of GOES and METEOSAT and others in the Argos system) or in dedicated satellites (such as SCD). The data rate is typically much lower than in satellite Internet access.

<text>Cripple Creek is a statutory city that is the county seat of Teller County, Colorado, United States. The city population was 1,155 at the 2020 United States census. Cripple Creek is a former gold mining camp located southwest of Colorado Springs near the base of Pikes Peak. The Cripple Creek Historic District, which received National Historic Landmark status in 1961, includes part or all of the city and the surrounding area. The city is now a part of the Colorado Springs, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Front Range Urban Corridor.

==History==

For many years, Cripple Creek&#x27;s high valley, at an elevation of , was considered no more important than a cattle pasture. Many prospectors avoided the area after the &quot;Mount Pisgah hoax&quot;, a mini gold rush caused by salting (adding gold to worthless rock).

On October 20, 1890, Robert Miller &quot;Bob&quot; Womack discovered a rich ore and the last great Colorado gold rush began. By July 1891, a post office was established. By November, hundreds of prospectors were camping in the area. Rather than investing in mines, Denver realtors Horace Bennett and Julius Myers sought wealth by platting 80 acres of land for a townsite which they named Fremont. The town consisted of 30 platted blocks containing 766 lots. Each lot sold for $25 and $50 for corner lots. Within a year, the lots value increased and sold for at least $250 each. Months later, investors from Colorado Springs platted 140 acres near Fremont and called their town Hayden Placer. Bennett and Myers filed another plat near the Broken Box Ranch and named it Cripple Creek. The towns’ combined population totalled 600-800 people by the end of 1891. By 1892, the Cripple Creek Mining District name had caught on and in June 1892, the post office assigned the Cripple Creek name to Fremont, Hayden Placer, and Cripple Creek and all the settlements became known as one. From 1892, Bennett and Myers oversaw the Fremont Electric Light and Power Company. The district’s first telephone was established in 1893. Thousands of prospectors flocked to the district, and before long Winfield Scott Stratton located the famous Independence lode, one of the largest gold strikes in history. In three years, the population increased from five hundred to ten thousand. The Palace Hotel and the Windsor Hotel were so full that chairs were rented out to be slept on for $1 a night. Although $500 million worth of gold ore was dug from Cripple Creek and more than 30 millionaires were produced since its mining heyday, Womack was not among them. Having sold his claim for $500 and a case of whiskey, he died penniless on August 10, 1909. By 1892, Cripple Creek was home to 5,000 people with another 5,000 in the nearby towns of Victor, Elton, Goldfield, Independence, Alton, and Strong. As people arrived, the marshal greeted them and confiscated their firearms, which were then sold in Denver to pay for the salary of the teachers of Cripple Creek.

In 1896, Cripple Creek suffered two disastrous fires. The first occurred on April 25 with flames resulting from a dispute between a bartender, Otto Floto, and his dancehall girlfriend, Jennie LaRue, on the second floor of the Central Dance Hall on Myers Avenue. Their struggle resulted in an oil lamp being thrown setting fire to the curtains. The fire incinerated most buildings on Myers Avenue before it was put out. Four days later, another fire destroyed much of the remaining half. A cook at the Portland Hotel spilled a kettle of grease on a hot stove, which caused fire to travel from Myers to Bennet Avenue and burned 1/3 of Cripple Creek. The town was rebuilt using brick and better construction methods in a period of a few months; most historic buildings today date back to 1896.

By 1900, the Cripple Creek mining district was home to 500 mines. By 1910, it had produced 22.4 million ounces of gold. Between 1894 and 1902, around 50,000 people lived in the mining district with 35,000 in the town of Cripple Creek alone making it the fourth most populous town in Colorado at the time. The seven adjoining boom towns includes Victor, Gillette, Alban, Independence, Goldfield, Elton, and Cameron—all of which were connected by rail. During the boom, there were 150 saloons, 49 grocery stores, 25 restaurants, four department stores, 12 casinos, 34 churches, a business college, a county school district with 19 schools and 118 teachers educating almost 4,000 students, 90 doctors, 40 stockbrokers, 15 newspapers, 9 assay offices, 10 barber shops, 72 lawyers, 20 houses of ill-repute, over 300 prostitutes, 26 one room cribs, and several opium dens. Prostitution flourished until the 1920s and was taxed at a rate of $6 a month per prostitute and $16 a month per madame. Pearl De Vere, a famous madame who owned The Old Homestead, a high class brothel that serviced wealthy mine owners and entrepreneurs of the area, was known to have charged clients in the upwards of $250 a night. Over 8,000 miners worked in the district making $3 per day. Most miners and foremen supplemented their incomes by as much as 1/3 through high grading. It was estimated that an average of $12 million dollars per year were stolen from the early mines through high grading.

While $3 a day was typical for a miner, some miners had to work 8 hours a day while others had to work 9 or 10 hours. The average miners paid $1.75 per week for an unfurnished house or $2.50 per week to boarding houses that included a room, bath, and meals. During the 1890s, many of the miners in the Cripple Creek area joined a miners&#x27; union, the Western Federation of Miners (WFM). A significant strike took place in 1894, marking one of the few times in history that a sitting governor called out the national guard to protect miners from anti-union violence by forces under the control of the mine owners. By 1903, the allegiance of the state government had shifted, and Governor James Peabody sent the Colorado National Guard into Cripple Creek with the goal of destroying union power in the gold camps. The WFM strike of 1903 and the governor&#x27;s response precipitated the Colorado Labor Wars, a struggle that took many lives.

The 1904 silent film short, &quot;Tracked by Bloodhounds; or, A Lynching at Cripple Creek&quot;, directed by Harry Buckwalter, was filmed in the area.

Through 2005, the Cripple Creek district produced about 23.5 million troy ounces (979 1/6 troy tons; 731 metric tons) of gold. The underground mines are mostly idle, except for a few small operations. There are significant underground deposits remaining which may become feasible to mine in the future. Large scale open pit mining and cyanide heap leach extraction of near-surface ore material, left behind by the old time miners as low grade, has taken place since 1994 east of Cripple Creek, near its sister city of Victor, Colorado. The district’s population began declining starting in 1905 as mines began closing. By 1920, only 40 mines were in business, and by 1945 the number dwindled to just 20 mines.

The current mining operation is conducted by Cripple Creek &amp; Victor Gold Mining Company (CC&amp;V), run currently by Newmont Mining. The mine operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Mine operations, maintenance, and processing departments work a rotating day/night schedule in 12-hour shifts.

With many empty storefronts and picturesque homes, Cripple Creek once drew interest as a ghost town. At one point, the population dropped to a few hundred, although Cripple Creek was never entirely deserted. In the 1970s and 1980s, travelers on photo safari might find themselves in a beautiful decaying historic town. A few restaurants and bars catered to tourists, who could pass weathered empty homes with lace curtains hanging in broken windows.

Colorado voters allowed Cripple Creek to establish legalized gambling in 1991. Cripple Creek is currently more of a gambling and tourist town than a ghost town. Casinos now occupy many historic buildings. Casino gambling has been successful in bringing revenue and vitality back into the area. It also provides funding for the &quot;State Historical Fund&quot;, administered by the Colorado Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation. In 2012, Colorado casinos produced over $104 million in tax revenue for these programs.

==Geography==
The gold-bearing area of the Cripple Creek district was the core of an ancient volcano within the central Colorado volcanic field, last active over 30 million years ago during the Oligocene. Free or native gold was found near the surface but at depth unoxidized gold tellurides and sulfides were found.

At the 2020 United States census, the town had a total area of , all of it land.

The community takes its name from nearby Cripple Creek.

==Demographics==
In the early years, miners arrived without their families to seek their fortunes. Once settled, their families joined them leading the district’s population to balloon. Over 1/3 of the district’s citizens were White and Catholic. Swedes were a large enough ethnic group to have established their own newspaper, &quot;Svenska Posten.&quot; Hundreds of French people lived in the district and owned many businesses. A small population of Chinese and African Americans secured employment in the laundry business and as porters in saloons. The Chinese were not allowed to work on mines and only a handful of African Americans were hired as miners. A good mix of Irish, French, German, African Americans and Chinese women worked as prostitutes who charged between 50 cents to $1.

As of the census of 2000, there were 1,115 people, 494 households, and 282 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 737 housing units at an average density of .

==Arts and culture==
The Cripple Creek and Victor Narrow Gauge Railroad, a narrow gauge train ride from Cripple Creek passes several small ghost towns, goldmines, and glory holes. The Mollie Kathleen Gold Mine provides tours into a real gold mine led by a real gold miner.

In 2006 Cripple Creek broke ground on the new Pikes Peak Heritage Center. Constructed at a cost over $2.5 million, the building is over of educational displays. State of the art electronics are used throughout the building and there is also a theatre showing historical films about the area. Newly named the Cripple Creek Heritage Center, admission is free.

Cripple Creek is also home to the Butte Opera House, a theatre first managed by the Mackin family (previous owners of the Imperial Hotel and producers of a long-running, much-loved melodrama theatre company). The Butte is currently the home of the Mountain Rep Theatre Company that produces plays, musicals, and classic melodramas year-round, including such shows as &quot;Forever Plaid, Hot Night in the Old Town, A Cripple Creek Christmas Carol&quot;, &quot;The Rocky Horror Show,&quot; and &quot;The Christmas Donkey&quot;&quot;.&quot;

Cripple Creek features many events throughout the year like the Cripple Creek Ice Festival, Donkey Derby Days, the July 4 Celebration, the annual Ice Castles, and a Gold Camp Christmas.

==Education==
Cripple Creek is served by the Cripple Creek-Victor School District RE-1. The district has one elementary school and one junior/senior high school, including Cresson Elementary School and Cripple Creek-Victor Junior/Senior High School. Principal of the Jr/Sr High School is Daniel Cummings and Miriam Mondragon is the Superintendent of Schools.

<doc id="45213" wikidata="Q9091" url="?curid=45213" title="Belarusian language">
<text>Belarusian (, ) is an East Slavic language. It is one of the two official languages in Belarus, alongside Russian. Additionally, it is spoken in some parts of Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, and Ukraine by Belarusian minorities in those countries.

Before Belarus gained independence in 1991, the language was known in English as &quot;Byelorussian&quot; or &quot;Belorussian&quot;, or alternatively as &quot;White Russian&quot;. Following independence, it became known as &quot;Belarusian&quot;, or alternatively as &quot;Belarusan&quot;.

As one of the East Slavic languages, Belarusian shares many grammatical and lexical features with other members of the group. To some extent, Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian retain a degree of mutual intelligibility. Belarusian descends from a language generally referred to as Ruthenian (13th to 18th centuries), which had, in turn, descended from what is referred to as Old East Slavic (10th to 13th centuries).

In the first Belarusian census in 1999, the Belarusian language was declared as a &quot;language spoken at home&quot; by about 3,686,000 Belarusian citizens (36.7% of the population). About 6,984,000 (85.6%) of Belarusians declared it their &quot;mother tongue&quot;. Other sources, such as &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, put the figure at approximately million active speakers in Belarus.
In Russia, the Belarusian language is declared as a &quot;familiar language&quot; by about 316,000 inhabitants, among them about 248,000 Belarusians, comprising about 30.7% of Belarusians living in Russia. In Ukraine, the Belarusian language is declared as a &quot;native language&quot; by about 55,000 Belarusians, which comprise about 19.7% of Belarusians living in Ukraine. In Poland, the Belarusian language is declared as a &quot;language spoken at home&quot; by about 40,000 inhabitants According to a study done by the Belarusian government in 2009, 72% of Belarusians speak Russian at home, while Belarusian is actively used by only 11.9% of Belarusians (others speak a mixture of Russian and Belarusian, known as Trasianka). Approximately 29.4% of Belarusians can write, speak, and read Belarusian, while 52.5% can only read and speak it. Nevertheless, there are no Belarusian-language universities in Belarus.

== Names ==
The Belarusian language has been known under a number of names, both contemporary and historical. Some of the most dissimilar are from the Old Belarusian period.

=== Official English-language name ===
* &quot;Belarusian&quot; () – derived from the name of the country &quot;Belarus&quot;. It may also be spelled &quot;Belarusan&quot; (), a form used officially from 1992 to 1995 including in the United Nations and by diaspora.

=== Historical ===
* &quot;Byelorussian&quot; (also spelled &quot;Belorussian&quot;, &quot;Bielorussian&quot;) – derived from the Russian-language name of the country &quot;Byelorussia&quot; (), used officially (in the Russian language) in the times of the USSR (1922–1991) and, later, in the Russian Federation.
* &quot;White Russian&quot; or &quot;White Ruthenian&quot; (and its equivalents in other languages) – literally, a word-by-word translation of the parts of the composite word &quot;Belarusian&quot;. The term &quot;White Ruthenian&quot; with reference to language has appeared in English-language texts since at least 1921. The oldest one, Latin term &quot;Albae Russiae, Poloczk dicto&quot; is recorded in 1381.

=== Alternative suggestions ===
* &quot;Grand Lithuanian&quot; () – proposed and used by Jan Stankievič since the 1960s, referencing chancery language of Grand Duchy of Lithuania, intended to part with the &quot;diminishing tradition of having the name related to the Muscovite tradition of calling the Belarusian lands&quot; and to pertain to the &quot;great tradition of Belarusian statehood&quot;. 
* &quot;Kryvian&quot; or &quot;Krivian&quot; (, ) – derived from the name of the Slavonic tribe Krivichi, one of the main tribes in the foundations of the forming of the Belarusian nation. Created and used in the 19th century by Belarusian Polish-speaking writers Jaroszewicz, Narbut, Rogalski, Jan Czeczot. Promoted by Vatslaw Lastowski.

=== Vernacular ===
* &quot;Simple&quot; () or &quot;local&quot; () – used mainly in times preceding the common recognition of the existence of the Belarusian language, and nation in general. Supposedly, the term can still be encountered up to the end of the 1930s, e.g., in Western Belarus. It is widely used to this day in Pomerania in reference to the mixed Polish-Belarusian dialects spoken there.
* &quot;Simple Black Ruthenian&quot; () – used in the beginning of the 19th century by the Russian researcher Baranovski and attributed to contemporary vernacular Belarusian.

== Classification and relationship to other languages ==
There is a high degree of mutual intelligibility among the Belarusian, Russian, and Ukrainian languages.

Within East Slavic, the Belarusian language is most closely related to Ukrainian.

==Dialects==
Besides the standardized lect, there are two main dialects of the Belarusian language, the North-Eastern and the South-Western. In addition, there is a transitional Middle Belarusian dialect group and the separate West Polesian dialect group.

The North-Eastern and the South-Western dialects are separated by a hypothetical line Ashmyany–Minsk–Babruysk–Gomel, with the area of the Middle Belarusian dialect group placed on and along this line.

The North-Eastern dialect is chiefly characterized by the &quot;soft sounding R&quot; () and &quot;strong akanye&quot; (), and the South-Western dialect is chiefly characterized by the &quot;hard sounding R&quot; () and &quot;moderate akanye&quot; ().

The West Polesian dialect group is separated from the rest of the country by the conventional line Pruzhany–Ivatsevichy–Tsyelyakhany–Luninyets–Stolin.

==History==


The modern Belarusian language was redeveloped on the base of the vernacular spoken remnants of the Ruthenian language, surviving in the ethnic Belarusian territories in the 19th century. The end of the 18th century (the times of the Divisions of Commonwealth) is the usual conventional borderline between the Ruthenian and Modern Belarusian stages of development.

By the end of the 18th century, (Old) Belarusian was still common among the minor nobility in the eastern part, in the territory of present-day Belarus, of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (hereafter GDL). Jan Czeczot in the 1840s had mentioned that even his generation&#x27;s grandfathers preferred speaking (Old) Belarusian. According to A. N. Pypin, the Belarusian language was spoken in some areas among the minor nobility during the 19th century. In its vernacular form, it was the language of the smaller town dwellers and of the peasantry and it had been the language of oral folklore. Teaching in Belarusian was conducted mainly in schools run by the Basilian order.

The development of Belarusian in the 19th century was strongly influenced by the political conflict in the territories of the former GDL, between the Russian Imperial authorities, trying to consolidate their rule over the &quot;joined provinces&quot;, and the Polish and Polonized nobility, trying to bring back its pre-Partitions rule (see also Polonization in times of Partitions).

 One of the important manifestations of this conflict was the struggle for ideological control over the educational system. The Polish and Russian languages were being introduced and re-introduced, while the general state of the people&#x27;s education remained poor until the very end of the Russian Empire.

In summary, the first two decades of the 19th century had seen the unprecedented prosperity of Polish culture and language in the former GDL lands, and had prepared the era of such famous Polish writers as Adam Mickiewicz and Władysław Syrokomla. The era had seen the effective completion of the Polonization of the lowest level of the nobility, the further reduction of the area of use of contemporary Belarusian, and the effective folklorization of Belarusian culture. Nevertheless, at the beginning of the 19th century &quot;there began a revival of national pride within the country ... and a growth in interest [in Belarusian] from outside&quot;.

Due both to the state of the people&#x27;s education and to the strong positions of Polish and Polonized nobility, it was only after the 1880s–1890s that the educated Belarusian element, still shunned because of &quot;peasant origin&quot;, began to appear in state offices.

In 1846, ethnographer Pavel Shpilevskiy prepared a Belarusian grammar (using the Cyrillic alphabet) on the basis of the folk dialects of the Minsk region. However, the Russian Academy of Sciences refused to print his submission, on the basis that it had not been prepared in a sufficiently scientific manner.

From the mid-1830s ethnographic works began to appear, and tentative attempts to study the language were instigated (e.g. Shpilevskiy&#x27;s grammar). The Belarusian literary tradition began to re-form, based on the folk language, initiated by the works of Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich. &quot;See also&quot;: Jan Czeczot, Jan Barszczewski.

At the beginning of the 1860s, both the Russian and Polish parties in Belarusian lands had begun to realise that the decisive role in the upcoming conflicts was shifting to the peasantry, overwhelmingly Belarusian. So a large amount of propaganda appeared, targeted at the peasantry and written in Belarusian; notably, the anti-Russian, anti-Tsarist, anti-Eastern Orthodox &quot;Manifesto&quot; and the first newspaper &quot;Mužyckaja prauda&quot; (&quot;Peasants&#x27; Truth&quot;) (1862–1863) by Konstanty Kalinowski, and anti-Polish, anti-Revolutionary, pro-Orthodox booklets and poems (1862).

The advent of the all-Russian &quot;narodniki&quot; and Belarusian national movements (late 1870s–early 1880s) renewed interest in the Belarusian language (See also: Homan (1884), Bahushevich, Yefim Karskiy, Dovnar-Zapol&#x27;skiy, Bessonov, Pypin, Sheyn, Nasovič). The Belarusian literary tradition was also renewed (&quot;see also&quot;: F. Bahushevich). It was in these times that F. Bahushevich made his famous appeal to Belarusians: &quot;Do not forsake our language, lest you pass away&quot; ().

The first dictionary of the modern Belarusian language authored by Nasovič was published in 1870. In the editorial introduction to the dictionary, it is noted that:

In 1891, in the preface to the &quot;Belarusian Flute&quot;, Francišak Bahuševič wrote, &quot;There have been many peoples, which first lost their language… and then they perished entirely. So do not abandon our Belarusian language, lest we perish!&quot;

According to the 1897 Russian Empire census, about 5.89 million people declared themselves speakers of Belarusian (then known as White Russian).

The end of the 19th century, however, still showed that the urban language of Belarusian towns remained either Polish or Russian. The same census showed that towns with a population greater than 50,000 had fewer than a tenth Belarusian speakers. This state of affairs greatly contributed to a perception that Belarusian was a &quot;rural&quot; and &quot;uneducated&quot; language.

However, the census was a major breakthrough for the first steps of the Belarusian national self-awareness and identity, since it clearly showed to the Imperial authorities and the still-strong Polish minority that the population and the language were neither Polish nor Russian.


=== 1900s–1910s ===
The rising influence of Socialist ideas advanced the emancipation of the Belarusian language even further (&quot;see also:&quot; Belarusian Socialist Assembly, Circle of Belarusian People&#x27;s Education and Belarusian Culture, Belarusian Socialist Lot, Socialist Party &quot;White Russia&quot;, Alaiza Pashkevich, Nasha Dolya). The fundamental works of Yefim Karsky marked a turning point in the scientific perception of Belarusian. The ban on publishing books and papers in Belarusian was officially removed (25 December 1904). The unprecedented surge of national feeling in the 20th century, especially among the workers and peasants, particularly after the events of 1905, gave momentum to the intensive development of Belarusian literature and press (See also: Nasha Niva, Yanka Kupala, Yakub Kolas).

==== Grammar ====
During the 19th and early 20th century, there was no normative Belarusian grammar. Authors wrote as they saw fit, usually representing the particularities of different Belarusian dialects. The scientific groundwork for the introduction of a truly scientific and modern grammar of the Belarusian language was laid down by the linguist Yefim Karsky.

By the early 1910s, the continuing lack of a codified Belarusian grammar was becoming intolerably obstructive in the opinion of uniformitarian prescriptivists. Then Russian academician Shakhmatov, chair of the Russian language and literature department of St. Petersburg University, approached the board of the Belarusian newspaper &quot;Nasha Niva&quot; with a proposal that a Belarusian linguist be trained under his supervision in order to be able to create documentation of the grammar. Initially, the famous Belarusian poet Maksim Bahdanovič was to be entrusted with this work. However, Bahdanovič&#x27;s poor health (tuberculosis) precluded his living in the climate of St. Petersburg, so Branislaw Tarashkyevich, a fresh graduate of the Vilnya Liceum No. 2, was selected for the task.

In the Belarusian community, great interest was vested in this enterprise. The already famous Belarusian poet Yanka Kupala, in his letter to Tarashkyevich, urged him to &quot;hurry with his much-needed work&quot;. Tarashkyevich had been working on the preparation of the grammar during 1912–1917, with the help and supervision of Shakhmatov and Karskiy. Tarashkyevich had completed the work by the autumn of 1917, even moving from the tumultuous Petrograd of 1917 to the relative calm of Finland in order to be able to complete it uninterrupted. 

By the summer of 1918, it became obvious that there were insurmountable problems with the printing of Tarashkyevich&#x27;s grammar in Petrograd: a lack of paper, type and qualified personnel. Meanwhile, his grammar had apparently been planned to be adopted in the workers&#x27; and peasants&#x27; schools of Belarus that were to be set up, so Tarashkyevich was permitted to print his book abroad. In June 1918, he arrived in Vilnius, via Finland. The Belarusian Committee petitioned the administration to allow the book to be printed. Finally, the first edition of the &quot;Belarusian grammar for schools&quot; was printed (Vil&#x27;nya, 1918).

There existed at least two other contemporary attempts at codifying the Belarusian grammar. In 1915, Rev. Balyaslaw Pachopka had prepared a Belarusian grammar using the Latin script. Belarusian linguist S. M. Nyekrashevich considered Pachopka&#x27;s grammar unscientific and ignorant of the principles of the language. But Pachopka&#x27;s grammar was reportedly taught in an unidentified number of schools, from 1918 for an unspecified period. Another grammar was supposedly jointly prepared by A. Lutskyevich and Ya. Stankyevich, and differed from Tarashkyevich&#x27;s grammar somewhat in the resolution of some key aspects.

=== 1914–1917 ===
On 22 December 1915, Paul von Hindenburg issued an order on schooling in German Army-occupied territories in the Russian Empire (Ober Ost), banning schooling in Russian and including the Belarusian language in an exclusive list of four languages made mandatory in the respective native schooling systems (Belarusian, Lithuanian, Polish, Yiddish). School attendance was not made mandatory, though. Passports at this time were bilingual, in German and in one of the &quot;native languages&quot;. Also at this time, Belarusian preparatory schools, printing houses, press organs were opened (&quot;see also:&quot; Homan (1916)).

=== 1917–1920 ===
After the 1917 February Revolution in Russia, the Belarusian language became an important factor in political activities in the Belarusian lands (&quot;see also:&quot; Central Council of Belarusian Organisations, Great Belarusian Council, First All-Belarusian Congress, Belnatskom). In the Belarusian Democratic Republic, Belarusian was used as the only official language (decreed by Belarusian People&#x27;s Secretariat on 28 April 1918). Subsequently, in the Byelorussian SSR, Belarusian was decreed to be one of the four (Belarusian, Polish, Russian, and Yiddish) official languages (decreed by Central Executive Committee of BSSR in February 1921).

=== 1920–1930 ===

==== Soviet Belarus ====
A decree of 15 July 1924 confirmed that the Belarusian, Russian, Yiddish and Polish languages had equal status in Soviet Belarus.

In the BSSR, Tarashkyevich&#x27;s grammar had been officially accepted for use in state schooling after its re-publication in unchanged form, first in 1922 by Yazep Lyosik under his own name as &quot;Practical grammar. Part I&quot;, then in 1923 by the Belarusian State Publishing House under the title &quot;Belarusian language. Grammar. Ed. I. 1923&quot;, also by &quot;Ya. Lyosik&quot;.

In 1925, Lyosik added two new chapters, addressing the orthography of compound words and partly modifying the orthography of assimilated words. From this point on, Belarusian grammar had been popularized and taught in the educational system in that form. The ambiguous and insufficient development of several components of Tarashkyevich&#x27;s grammar was perceived to be the cause of some problems in practical usage, and this led to discontent with the grammar.

In 1924–25, Lyosik and his brother Anton Lyosik prepared and published their project of orthographic reform, proposing a number of radical changes. A fully phonetic orthography was introduced. One of the most distinctive changes brought in was the principle of akanye (), wherein unstressed &quot;o&quot;, pronounced in both Russian and Belarusian as , is written as &quot;а&quot;.
The Belarusian Academic Conference on Reform of the Orthography and Alphabet was convened in 1926. After discussions on the project, the Conference made resolutions on some of the problems. However, the Lyosik brothers&#x27; project had not addressed all the problematic issues, so the Conference was not able to address all of those.

As the outcome of the conference, the Orthographic Commission was created to prepare the project of the actual reform. This was instigated on 1 October 1927, headed by S. Nyekrashevich, with the following principal guidelines of its work adopted:
* To consider the resolutions of the Belarusian Academic Conference (1926) non-mandatory, although highly competent material.
* To simplify Tarashkyevich&#x27;s grammar where it was ambiguous or difficult in use, to amend it where it was insufficiently developed (e.g., orthography of assimilated words), and to create new rules if absent (orthography of proper names and geographical names).

During its work in 1927–29, the Commission had actually prepared the project for spelling reform. The resulting project had included both completely new rules and existing rules in unchanged and changed forms, some of the changes being the work of the Commission itself, and others resulting from the resolutions of the Belarusian Academic Conference (1926), re-approved by the Commission.

Notably, the use of the &quot;Ь&quot; (soft sign) before the combinations &quot;consonant+iotated vowel&quot; (&quot;softened consonants&quot;), which had been previously denounced as highly redundant (e.g., in the proceedings of the Belarusian Academic Conference (1926)), was cancelled. However, the complete resolution of the highly important issue of the orthography of unstressed &quot;Е&quot; (&quot;IE&quot;) was not achieved.

Both the resolutions of the Belarusian Academic Conference (1926) and the project of the Orthographic Commission (1930) caused much disagreement in the Belarusian academic environment. Several elements of the project were to be put under appeal in the &quot;higher (political) bodies of power&quot;.

==== West Belarus ====
In West Belarus, under Polish rule, the Belarusian language was at a disadvantage. Schooling in the Belarusian language was obstructed, and the printing in Belarusian experienced political oppression.

The prestige of the Belarusian language in Western Belarus during this period hinged significantly on the image of the BSSR being the &quot;true Belarusian home&quot;. This image, however, was strongly disrupted by the &quot;purges&quot; of &quot;national-democrats&quot; in the BSSR (1929–30) and by the subsequent grammar reform (1933).

Tarashkyevich&#x27;s grammar was re-published five times in Western Belarus. However, the 5th edition (1929) (reprinted verbatim in Belarus in 1991 and often referred to) was the version diverging from the previously published one, which Tarashkyevich had prepared disregarding the Belarusian Academic Conference (1926) resolutions. 

===1930s===

====Soviet Belarus====

In 1929–30, the Communist authorities of Soviet Belarus made a series of drastic crackdowns against the supposed &quot;national-democratic counter-revolution&quot; (informally &quot;nats-dems&quot; ()). Effectively, entire generations of Socialist Belarusian national activists in the first quarter of the 20th century were wiped out of political, scientific and social existence. Only the most famous cult figures (e.g. Yanka Kupala) were spared.

However, a new power group in Belarusian science quickly formed during these power shifts, under the virtual leadership of the Head of the Philosophy Institute of the Belarusian Academy of Sciences, academician S. Ya. Vol’fson (). The book published under his editorship, &quot;Science in Service of Nats-Dems&#x27; Counter-Revolution&quot; (1931), represented the new spirit of political life in Soviet Belarus.

====1933 reform of Belarusian grammar====
The Reform of Belarusian Grammar (1933) had been brought out quite unexpectedly, supposedly [Stank 1936], with the project published in the central newspaper of the Belarusian Communist Party (&quot;Zviazda)&quot; on 1933-06-28 and the decree of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars (Council of Ministers) of BSSR issued on 1933-08-28, to gain the status of law on 1933-09-16.

There had been some post-facto speculations, too, that the 1930 project of the reform (as prepared by people who were no longer seen as politically &quot;clean&quot;), had been given for the &quot;purification&quot; to the &quot;nats-dems&quot; competition in the Academy of Sciences, which would explain the &quot;block&quot; nature of the differences between the 1930 and 1933 versions. Peculiarly, Jan Stankievič in his notable critique of the reform [Stank 1936] failed to mention the 1930 project, dating the reform project to 1932.

The reform resulted in the grammar officially used, with further amendments, in Byelorussian SSR and modern Belarus. Sometimes this grammar is called the &quot;official&quot; grammar of the Belarusian language, to distinguish it from the &quot;pre-reform&quot; grammar, known as the &quot;classic&quot; grammar or Taraškievica. It is also known as &quot;narkamaŭka&quot;, after the word &quot;narkamat&quot;, a Belarusian abbreviation for People&#x27;s Commissariat (ministry). The latter term bears a derogatory connotation.

The officially announced causes for the reform were:
* The pre-1933 grammar was maintaining artificial barriers between the Russian and Belarusian languages.
* The reform was to cancel the influences of the Polonisation corrupting the Belarusian language.
* The reform was to remove the archaisms, neologisms and vulgarisms supposedly introduced by the &quot;national-democrats&quot;.
* The reform was to simplify the grammar of the Belarusian language.

The reform had been accompanied by a fervent press campaign directed against the &quot;nats-dems not yet giving up.&quot;

The decree had been named &quot;On Changing and Simplifying Belarusian Spelling&quot; (), but the bulk of the changes had been introduced into the grammar. Jan Stankievič, in his critique of the reform talked about 25 changes, with one of them being strictly orthographical and 24 relating to both orthography and grammar. [Stank 1936]

Many of the changes in the orthography proper (&quot;stronger principle of AH-ing,&quot; &quot;no redundant soft sign,&quot; &quot;uniform &quot;nye&quot; and &quot;byez&quot;&quot;) were, in fact, simply implementations of earlier proposals made by people who had subsequently suffered political suppression (e.g., Yazep Lyosik, Lastowski, Nyekrashevich, 1930 project). [Padluzhny 2004]

The morphological principle in the orthography had been strengthened, which also had been proposed in 1920s.

The &quot;removal of the influences of the Polonisation&quot; had been represented, effectively, by the:
* Reducing the use of the &quot;consonant+non-iotated vowel&quot; in assimilated Latinisms in favour of &quot;consonant+iotated vowel,&quot; leaving only Д, Т, Р &quot;unexceptionally&quot; &quot;hard.&quot;
* Changing the method of representing the sound &quot;L&quot; in Latinisms to another variant of the Belarusian sound Л (of 4 variants existing), rendered with succeeding non-iotated vowels instead of iotated.
* Introducing the new preferences of use of the letters Ф over Т for &quot;theta&quot;, and В over Б for &quot;beta&quot;, in Hellenisms. [Stank 1936]

The &quot;removing of the artificial barriers between the Russian and Belarusian languages&quot; (virtually the often-quoted &quot;Russification of the Belarusian language&quot;, which may well happen to be a term coined by Yan Stankyevich) had, according to Stankyevich, moved the normative Belarusian morphology and syntax closer to their Russian counterparts, often removing from use the indigenous features of the Belarusian language. [Stank 1936]

Stankyevich also observed that some components of the reform had moved the Belarusian grammar closer to the grammars of other Slavonic languages, which would hardly be its goal. [Stank 1936]

====West Belarus====
In West Belarus, there had been some voices raised against the reform, chiefly by the non-Communist/non-socialist wing of the Belarusian national scene. Yan Stankyevich was named to the Belarusian Scientific Society, Belarusian National Committee and Society of the Friends of Belarusian Linguistics at Wilno University. Certain political and scientific groups and figures went on using the pre-reform orthography and grammar, however, thus multiplying and differing versions.

However, the reformed grammar and orthography had been used, too, for example during the process of Siarhei Prytytski in 1936.

===Second World War===

During the Occupation of Belarus by Nazi Germany (1941–1944), the Belarusian collaborationists influenced newspapers and schools to use the Belarusian language. This variant did not use any of the post-1933 changes in vocabulary, orthography and grammar. Much publishing in Belarusian Latin script was done. In general, in the publications of the Soviet partisan movement in Belarus, the normative 1934 grammar was used.

=== Post Second World War ===

After the Second World War, several major factors influenced the development of the Belarusian language. The most important was the implementation of the &quot;rapprochement and unification of Soviet people&quot; policy, which resulted by the 1980s in the Russian language effectively and officially assuming the role of the principal means of communication, with Belarusian relegated to a secondary role. The post-war growth in the number of publications in the Belarusian language in BSSR drastically lagged behind those in Russian. The use of Belarusian as the main language of education was gradually limited to rural schools and humanitarian faculties. The BSSR counterpart of the USSR law &quot;On strengthening of ties between school and real life and on the further development of popular education in the USSR&quot; (1958), adopted in 1959, along with introduction of a mandatory 8-year school education, made it possible for the parents of pupils to opt for non-mandatory studying of the &quot;second language of instruction,&quot; which would be Belarusian in a Russian language school and vice versa. However, for example in the 1955/56 school year, there were 95% of schools with Russian as the primary language of instruction, and 5% with Belarusian as the primary language of instruction. The Belarusian was mostly used as a language of instruction in Belarusian rural schools or humanities faculties and was popularly regarded as an &quot;uncultured, rural language of rural people&quot;. Consequently, Belarusian cities became Russian-speaking in the 1960s due to the lack of education in Belarusian language in schools and universities.

That was the source of concern for the nationally minded and caused, for example, the series of publications by Barys Sachanka in 1957–61 and the text named &quot;Letter to a Russian Friend&quot; by Alyaksyey Kawka (1979). The BSSR Communist party leader Kirill Mazurov made some tentative moves to strengthen the role of Belarusian language in the second half of the 1950s.

After the beginning of Perestroika and the relaxing of political control in the late 1980s, a new campaign in support of the Belarusian language was mounted in BSSR, expressed in the &quot;Letter of 58&quot; and other publications, producing a certain level of popular support and resulting in the BSSR Supreme Soviet ratifying the &quot;Law on Languages&quot; (&quot;&quot;; 26 January 1990) requiring the strengthening of the role of Belarusian in state and civic structures.

==== 1959 reform of grammar ====

A discussion on problems in Belarusian orthography and on the further development of the language was held from 1935 to 1941. From 1949 to 1957 this continued, although it was deemed there was a need to amend some unwarranted changes to the 1933 reform. The Orthography Commission, headed by Yakub Kolas, set up the project in about 1951, but it was approved only in 1957, and the normative rules were published in 1959. These rules had been accepted as normative for the Belarusian language since then, receiving minor practical changes in the 1985 edition.

A project to correct parts of the 1959 rules was conducted from 2006 to 2007.

=== Post-1991 ===

The process of government support for &quot;Belarusization&quot; began even before the breakup of the Soviet Union, with the Supreme Soviet of the BSSR passing a law on languages in 1990 that aimed for the gradual increase in prestige and general use of the Belarusian language over the next 10 years, followed by the creation that same year of a National Language Program to support this endeavor. After Belarus became independent in 1991, support for the cause of the Belarusian language gained prestige and popular interest, with the post-Soviet Belarusian government the continued creation of policies to actively promote the use of the Belarusian language, especially in education. The creation of the 1994 Constitution declared Belarusian to be the sole official language, though Russian was given the status as &quot;language of inter-ethnic communication&quot;. However, the implementation of the 1992–94 &quot;Law on Languages&quot; took place in such a way that it provoked public protests and was dubbed &quot;Landslide Belarusization&quot; and &quot;undemocratic&quot; by those opposing it in 1992–94.

After the election of Alexander Lukashenko as the President of Belarus in the 1994 elections, the positions of Belarusian language in Belarusian education system worsened as the number of first graders who were taught in Belarusian significantly decreased (e.g. in capital Minsk from 58.6% in 1994 to just 4.8% in 1998) and by 2001 most of the major Belarusian cities had no schools where its pupils were instructed in Belarusian, however Minsk still had 20 Belarusian-language schools. In 1996, Russian language was given equal status to Belarusian following changes in the Constitution of Belarus and subsequently became Belarus&#x27;s language of administration, business and education. In 1999, only 17% of pupils attended Belarusian-language elementary schools in Belarus. Moreover, a complete minority (~10.5%) of single-circulation newspapers were printed in Belarusian and the amounts decreases each year.

In a referendum held on 14 May 1995 the Belarusian language lost its exclusive status as the only state language. State support for Belarusian language and culture in general has dwindled since then, and Russian is dominant in everyday life in today&#x27;s Belarus. In a 2006 article, Roy Medvedev compared the position of the Belarusian language in Belarus with that of the Irish language in the Republic of Ireland. Adam Maldzis considers that one of typological similarities is the official bilinguism both in Belarus and Ireland, and the low real status of the mother-tongue.

A spelling reform of the official Belarusian language, making the spelling of some words more similar to Taraškievič&#x27;s system, was decided on 23 July 2008, and went into effect on 1 September 2010.

===Discrimination against Belarusian speakers===
Under the regime of Belarus&#x27;s current president, Alexander Lukashenko, members of the Belarusian speaking minority in Belarus have complained about the discrimination against the Belarusian language in Belarus.

Despite a formally equal status of Russian and Belarusian, Russian is primarily used by the Belarusian government, and cases of discrimination against the Belarusian language are not rare, even though the discrimination is not institutionalized. Authorities occasionally make minor concessions to demands for a widening of the usage of the Belarusian language.

Organisations promoting Belarusian language such as the Francišak Skaryna Belarusian Language Society were reported as being the object of attacks by Belarus-based Russian neo-Nazi groups in the 1990s and 2000s.

The Frantsishak Skaryna Society has reported about the following categories of violations against the rights of Belarusian speakers in Belarus:

* The right to receive public and private services in the Belarusian language;
* The right to access legislation in the Belarusian language;
* The right to receive education in the Belarusian language;
* The right to an equitable presence of the Belarusian language in the media;
* The right to receive full oral and written information in the Belarusian language on the products and services proposed by commercial companies.

Belarusian speakers are facing numerous obstacles when trying to arrange Belarusian language education for their children. there are no Belarusian-language universities in the country.

In its 2016 human rights in Belarus report, the US State Department also stated that there was &quot;discrimination against ... those who sought to use the Belarusian language.&quot; &quot;Because the government viewed many proponents of the Belarusian language as political opponents, authorities continued to harass and intimidate academic and cultural groups that sought to promote Belarusian and routinely rejected proposals to widen use of the language,&quot;.

=== 2010s–2020s ===

In the 2010s, the situation of Belarusian has started to change slightly due to the efforts of language-advocacy institutions, of individual representatives of such educational, cultural, scientific and linguistic organizations as the Francišak Skaryna Belarusian Language Society, the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, the , and in response to the endeavours of pro-Belarusian public figures from the media and communication field, musicians, philosophers, entrepreneurs and benefactors.

Despite the language losing its exclusive position in the wake of the 1995 Belarusian referendum, new signs of the spread of Belarusian have appeared, trickling down into Belarusian society — with advertising campaigns supporting the cause (outdoor billboards promoting and acquainting people with the Belarusian language, branding campaigns for the leading telecommunication providers like Velcom, etc.), the simplified version of the Belarusian Latin alphabet on the metro map being introduced into the messages of the transport network, dedicated advertising festivals like AD!NAK upholding marketing communication in Belarusian, and informal language-courses (such as Mova Nanova, Mova ci kava, Movavedy) having sprung up in Minsk and around Belarus and spurring further interest of people, especially of young people, in developing good Belarusian communication skills in everyday life.

President Lukashenko, in his 2014 State of the Nation address, emphasized that losing the ability to speak Belarusian will be losing a part of the country&#x27;s history.
The 2019 Belarusian census demonstrated that the Belarusian language is perceived as a native language of Belarus by ~60% of its population, however only ~25% use it in their everyday life. The Belarusian language has marginalized status in terms of usage in Belarus, despite being officially recognized as its state language (along with Russian language). The usage of Belarusian in major Belarusian cities is rare. Approximately 95% of Belarusian state operates in the Russian language and the Belarusian language is mostly absent in Belarusian education, state media and government affairs where the main information is provided in Russian. For example, in 2011 Russian-language broadcasts on the Belarusian &quot;state package&quot; TV channels accounted for 35,302 hours of air time and highly overshadowed 626 hours of air time in Belarusian-language (only 1.7% of all air time). None of the universities in Belarus are providing a Belarusian-language education and Belarusian language lessons in schools are declining. In 2016, only 13% of pupils in Belarus attended elementary schools where the language of instruction was Belarusian. The Belarusian language is still partly used in some cultural, traditional and folklore activities. According to Belarusian poet Valzhyna Mort, who grew up in Belarus, the Belarusian language is mocked for its &quot;village sound&quot; and is considered &quot;useless&quot; in Belarus. According to Belarusian poet Julija Cimafiejeva, the majority of the books sold in Belarus were imported from Russia in 2019 and in comparison to Russian books the Belarusian language books are not common and mostly are related with educational purposes. The annual circulation of Belarusian language literature significantly decreased from 1990 to 2020: magazines (from 312 mil to 39.6 mil), books and brochures (from 9.3 mil to 3.1 mil).
Belarusian speakers in Belarus are viewed as those who are against the Lukashenko&#x27;s government and politically-motivated charges were applied to them. In 2020, following the beginning of the 2020–2021 Belarusian protests, many Belarusian writers and artists were repressed in Belarus. In August 2021, Belarusian PEN Centre, Union of Belarusian Writers and the Belarusian Association of Journalists were liquidated and the Ministry of Justice of Belarus applied for liquidation of the Francišak Skaryna Belarusian Language Society in the Supreme Court of Belarus.

=== or (Classical orthography) ===

There exists an alternative literary norm of the Belarusian language, named (). Its promoters and users prevalently refer to it as (&quot;Classic orthography&quot;). Generally Taraškievica favors Polish-inspired pronunciations (, ) while regular Belarusian follows Russian-inspired pronunciations (, ). Taraškievica also features a more phonetic spelling system, particularly using a separate letter for the [ɡ] sound, which is argued to be an allophone of [ɣ] rather than a phoneme.

== Phonology ==
Although closely related to other East Slavic languages, especially Ukrainian, Belarusian phonology is distinct in a number of ways. The phoneme inventory of the modern Belarusian language consists of 45 to 54 phonemes: 6 vowels and 39 to 48 consonants, depending on how they are counted. When the nine geminate consonants are excluded as mere variations, there are 39 consonants, and excluding rare consonants further decreases the count. The number 48 includes &quot;all&quot; consonant sounds, including variations and rare sounds, which may be phonetically distinct in the modern Belarusian language.

== Alphabet ==

The Belarusian alphabet is a variant of the Cyrillic script, which was first used as an alphabet for the Old Church Slavonic language. The modern Belarusian form was defined in 1918, and consists of thirty-two letters. Before that, Belarusian had also been written in the Belarusian Latin alphabet (Łacinka / Лацінка), the Belarusian Arabic alphabet (by Lipka Tatars) and the Hebrew alphabet (by Belarusian Jews). The Glagolitic script was used, sporadically, until the 11th or 12th century.

There are several systems of romanization of Belarusian written texts. The Belarusian Latin alphabet is rarely used.

== Grammar ==

Standardized Belarusian grammar in its modern form was adopted in 1959, with minor amendments in 1985 and 2008. It was developed from the initial form set down by Branislaw Tarashkyevich (first printed in Vilnius, 1918), and it is mainly based on the Belarusian folk dialects of Minsk-Vilnius region. Historically, there have been several other alternative standardized forms of Belarusian grammar.

Belarusian grammar is mostly synthetic and partly analytic, and overall quite similar to Russian grammar. Belarusian orthography, however, differs significantly from Russian orthography in some respects, due to the fact that it is a phonemic orthography that closely represents the surface phonology, whereas Russian orthography represents the underlying morphophonology.

The most significant instance of this is found in the representation of vowel reduction, and in particular &quot;akanje&quot;, the merger of unstressed /a/ and /o/, which exists in both Russian and Belarusian. Belarusian always spells this merged sound as , whereas Russian uses either or , according to what the &quot;underlying&quot; phoneme is (determined by identifying the related words where the vowel is being stressed or, if no such words exist, by written tradition, mostly but not always conforming to etymology). This means that Belarusian noun and verb paradigms, in their written form, have numerous instances of alternations between written and , whereas no such alternations exist in the corresponding written paradigms in Russian. This can significantly complicate the foreign speakers&#x27; task of learning these paradigms; on the other hand, though, it makes spelling easier for native speakers.

An example illustrating the contrast between the treatment of &quot;akanje&quot; in Russian and Belarusian orthography is the spelling of the word for &quot;products; food&quot;:
* In Ukrainian: продукти (pronounced &quot;produkty&quot;, : [proˈduktɪ])
* In Russian: продукты (pronounced &quot;pradukty&quot;, : [prɐˈduktɨ])
* In Belarusian: прадукты (pronounced &quot;pradukty&quot;, : [praˈduktɨ])

== Computer representation ==
Belarusian is represented by the ISO 639 code &quot;be&quot; or &quot;bel&quot;, or more specifically by IETF language tags &quot;be-1959acad&quot; (so-called &quot;Academic&quot; [&quot;governmental&quot;] variant of Belarusian as codified in 1959) or &quot;be-tarask&quot; (Belarusian in Taraskievica orthography).

== Sample text ==
Article 1 of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; in Belarusian (be-1959acad):Усе людзі нараджаюцца свабоднымі і роўнымі ў сваёй годнасці і правах. Яны надзелены розумам і сумленнем і павінны ставіцца адзін да аднаго ў духу брацтва.

The same text using the Taraškievica orthography (be-tarask):Усе людзі нараджаюцца свабоднымі і роўнымі ў сваёй годнасьці і правах. Яны надзелены розумам і сумленьнем і павінны ставіцца адзін да аднаго ў духу брацтва.

The romanization of the text into Latin alphabet:&quot;Usie ludzi naradžajucca svabodnymi i rownymi w svajoj hodnasci i pravach. Jany nadzieleny rozumam i sumlenniem i pavinny stavicca adzin da adnaho w duchu bractva.&quot;

Article 1 of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; in English:All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

<doc id="45214" wikidata="Q1751029" url="?curid=45214" title="Ali G">
<text>Alistair Leslie Graham, better known as Ali G, is a satirical fictional character created and performed by English comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. A faux-streetwise poseur from Staines, England, Ali G speaks in rude boy-style Multicultural London English. He conducts interviews with unsuspecting subjects who do not realise they have been set up.

Ali G first appeared as the &quot;voice of da yoof&quot; on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The 11 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot; in 1998, and he subsequently became the title character of &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot; in the early 2000s, and was also the title character of the film &quot;Ali G Indahouse&quot;. In a 2001 poll by Channel 4, Ali G was ranked eighth on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters.

In a 2007 interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Baron Cohen announced that Ali G, along with Borat (another fictional character made by Baron Cohen), had been retired. However, Ali G returned at the 2012 British Comedy Awards to accept Baron Cohen&#x27;s Outstanding Achievement Award, causing controversy by making jokes about Kate Middleton and Jimmy Savile. Ali G returned to television with &quot;Ali G Rezurection&quot; in 2014. &quot;Rezurection&quot; features new footage of Ali G introducing old highlights of &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot;, while Borat reappeared for &quot;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm&quot; in 2020.

==Development==
Ali G is a fictional stereotype of a British suburban male &quot;chav&quot; also known as Alex or Alistair; who imitates inner-city urban British hip hop culture and British Jamaican culture, particularly through hip hop, reggae, drum and bass and jungle music, as well as speaking in rude boy-style Multicultural London English from Jamaican Patois. Ali G was part of a group called the &quot;West Staines Massiv&quot;, and grew up near Staines in Langley. He also lived part of his life in Staines.

Baron Cohen has stated that BBC Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood was an influence on the development of his character. Westwood used to host Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Rap Show&quot; and became known for speaking in a Multicultural London English dialect. Ali G&#x27;s middle-class credentials mirror Westwood&#x27;s, as the latter was brought up in Lowestoft as a bishop&#x27;s son. Prior to his character&#x27;s first appearance on &quot;The 11 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot;, Baron Cohen had portrayed an early incarnation of him named MC Jocelyn Cheadle-Hume on a show he presented called &quot;F2F&quot;, which ran on the satellite channel Granada Talk TV. While in character, Baron Cohen chatted to a group of skateboarders and realised that people could be led to believe his character was real; he then filmed a number of segments which were ordered off-air by London Weekend Television.

==History and appearances==
Ali G, a faux-streetwise poseur with a deeply stereotypical view of the world, first came to prominence on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The 11 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot; as the &quot;voice of da yoof&quot; in 1998. He interviewed various public figures in the United Kingdom, always either embarrassing his interviewee by displaying a mixture of uninformed political incorrectness, or getting the interviewee to agree to some shocking inaccuracy or insult.

Other examples of his bold interviewing style include getting Lindsay Urwin, the Bishop of Horsham, to admit that God created the universe and then asking him, &quot;And since then, [God]&#x27;s just chilled?&quot; Ali G asked the Bishop about God&#x27;s appearance, to which the Bishop replied, &quot;Well, he&#x27;s sort of Jesus-shaped.&quot; During an interview with James Ferman, former director of the British Board of Film Classification, Ali G asks whether his made-up vulgarities would restrict a film to an over-18 audience, and suggests that film censorship be performed by younger persons who understand contemporary slang. In an interview with the chairman of the Arts Council of England, Gerry Robinson, Ali G&#x27;s first question was, &quot;Why is the arts so – excuse me French, but – crap?&quot;

Ali G appeared in the 2003 short film &quot;Spyz&quot;, directed by James Bobin. It showcases Ali G as James Bond in a series of inexplicably occurring action and sex scenes. In 2004, Ali G gave the commencement speech at Harvard.

Ali G was in a series of ads for the 2005–06 NBA season, in which he used his brand of off-kilter journalism to interview various NBA stars. The spots were directed by Spike Lee.

Ali G was also featured in the music video &quot;Music&quot; by Madonna as her limo driver. He complains that her &quot;babylons&quot; are not as big as they appear to be on TV and calls her &quot;Maradona&quot; when asking to be in her next video.

Baron Cohen received the Outstanding Achievement Award at the 2012 British Comedy Awards and appeared in character as Ali G to accept the trophy.

In 2015 Ali G appeared at the 88th Academy Awards. Baron Cohen did not tell the ceremony&#x27;s producers beforehand that he would appear on stage as his Ali G character instead of himself. He and his then-wife, actress Isla Fisher, locked themselves in the bathroom for 40 minutes to secretly put on his costume, after telling people he had food poisoning.

==Background==
Ali G is the leader of a fictional gang called &quot;Da West Staines Massif&quot;, who currently lives in his grandmother&#x27;s garage in a semi-detached house at 36 Cherry Blossom Close, in the heart of the &quot;Staines Ghetto&quot;. He was educated at what he calls &quot;da Matthew Arnold Skool&quot;, which is a real school in Staines.

Staines, a commuter town to the west of London, is different from the inner city ghetto that Ali G claims. In the same comic vein, he also makes reference to stockbroker belt towns in the area, such as Egham, Langley and Englefield Green with which he contrasts Staines. Despite the incongruous nature of his hometown, he purports to exemplify inner city culture. Ali&#x27;s full name is later revealed to be Alistair Leslie Graham (revealed in the eponymous film, much to his embarrassment).

Ali G speaks a comical in keeping with his delusions of being black with Jamaican ancestry and peppered with such catchphrases as &quot;aight&quot; or &quot;aiii&quot; (alright), &quot;booyakasha&quot;, &quot;big up yaself&quot;, &quot;wagwaan&quot;, &quot;west side&quot;, &quot;batty boy&quot;, &quot;respek&quot;, &quot;for real&quot;, &quot;punani&quot;, &quot;check it&quot;, &quot;wicked&quot; and &quot;keep it real&quot;. His trademark hand gesture closely resembles the &quot;dip snap&quot;.

==Criticisms==
Although Baron Cohen has repeatedly stated that Ali G is a parody of suburban, privileged youth acting in a way that they think is typical of black people, some commentators have opined that the force of the humour is derived from stereotypes of blacks, not poseur whites. According to this view of the character, the suburban background written into Ali G&#x27;s character serves as a false alibi. The sociologist Tara Alturi observed that, by presenting as racially ambiguous, Ali G both exploits minstrel show racial stereotypes for humour and ridicules white minstrel expropriation.

The comedian Felix Dexter has said that he appreciated the humour of an innocent ignoramus confronting an expert with neither understanding the other, but felt that &quot;a lot of the humour is laughing at black street culture and it is being celebrated because it allows the liberal middle classes to laugh at that culture in a safe context where they can retain their sense of political correctness&quot;. Fellow comedian Victoria Wood criticised Baron Cohen&#x27;s style of comedy, saying that his &quot;endless setting up of victims&quot; was &quot;tiresome&quot; and akin to &quot;laughing at lunatics&quot;.

== People interviewed by Ali G ==

* Edwin &quot;Buzz&quot; Aldrin (1930–), whom Ali G addresses as &quot;Buzz Lightyear,&quot; former astronaut, and the second man to walk on the Moon: Ali asks him if he was &quot;ever jealous of Louis Armstrong&quot;, Aldrin has to correct him and reminds him that it was in fact Neil Armstrong who landed on the Moon. Ali G also asks whether the &quot;people on the Moon&quot; were friendly or scared of Aldrin upon landing on the Moon. Ali insists that Aldrin should put conspiracy theorists straight, saying &quot;what do you say to all of those conspiracy theorists who come up to you and say, does the Moon really exist?&quot; He also believes that Aldrin was the first person to perform the moonwalk dance, not Michael Jackson.
* David Alderdice, 43rd Lord Mayor of Belfast: Ali refers to him as the &quot;Lord Mayor of Ireland&quot; at the beginning of the interview. He also believed that Terry Wogan was part of the IRA.
* John Gray, author of &quot;Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus&quot;.
* David Beckham, former football player, and Victoria Beckham, a member of the Spice Girls.
* Tony Benn (1925–2014), former Labour MP for Chesterfield, Cabinet Minister and chairman of the Labour Party from 1971 to 1972. Benn is shocked at Ali&#x27;s stubborn and cynical view of the world. During the interview, Ali expresses his view that the workers who went on strike in 1984 were lazy and pulling a &quot;sickie&quot;, and that most people want to chill at home and watch TV instead of having to go to work. Ali suggests to Benn that celebrities and professional athletes such as Frank Bruno should become candidates, instead of barely known politicians who &quot;probably sleep with horses&quot;. Benn wrote in his diary on the day of the interview that Ali G had, &quot;no knowledge of history at all but... he was an intelligent guy&quot;; on discovering that the interview was a hoax, he wrote, &quot;it was a fraud to write and say you want to do an interview about young people and politics, then bring this chap along who is an actor and makes you look a proper charlie.&quot; Later, he wrote that Cohen had written to him to ask if he would take part in a new film he was making, saying that Benn had been the only person that he&#x27;d interviewed who had &quot;dealt seriously with his loud, sexist, materialist image of youth&quot;. Benn refused on the grounds that, &quot;You can&#x27;t be a comedian and a serious politician.&quot; However, Benn did end his reply letter with, &quot;You&#x27;re my main man&quot;.
* Rhodes Boyson (1925–2012), former Conservative Education Minister, who agreed with Ali G that the metric system should not be taught in schools because, &quot;one deals in quarters and eighths of ounces&quot;.
* Pat Buchanan (1938–), former White House Communications Director to President Ronald Reagan, political commentator and former presidential candidate: Ali makes an irrelevant comparison of lying to become United States President, to himself falsely claiming to work hard at McDonald&#x27;s but instead admitted to Buchanan that he ate 15 McChicken sandwiches a day, sold marijuana and that he wore the costume of Ronald McDonald while having sex. During the interview, he mistakenly refers to WMD bombs as BLT sandwiches. Buchanan apparently assumes he is referring to bio-lethal toxins; but near the end, he asks Buchanan &quot;is it ever worth fighting a war over sandwiches&quot;.
* Boutros Boutros-Ghali (1922–2016), former Secretary General of the United Nations, mistakenly called &#x27;Boutros Boutros Boutros Boutros Ghali&#x27; by Ali G. Boutros-Ghali clearly went so far as to participate in some of Ali G&#x27;s notorious word games and providing the epilogue to the episode where, at Ali G&#x27;s bidding, he tells youth viewers &#x27;I am Boutros Boutros-Ghali; put down your guns and listen to Bob Marley.&#x27; In response to Ali G&#x27;s perceived ignorance, Boutros-Ghali provides a detailed explanation about why Disneyland is not represented in the United Nations, and reveals which foreign languages sound comical to his ear.
* Noam Chomsky (1928–), MIT professor and linguist: During this interview, Ali G is perplexed about the difference between the terms &quot;bilingual&quot; and &quot;bisexual&quot; after asking if his &quot;4-year-old part-Bangladeshi and part-English cousin will grow up to speak both languages&quot;.
* Jarvis Cocker (1963–), Pulp singer
* Linda Cohn, ESPN anchor
* Gaz Coombes, Supergrass singer
* Paul Daniels (1938–2016), magician
* Sam Donaldson (1934–), ABC news journalist for over 45 years: In the interview, Ali G confuses President Nixon&#x27;s Watergate scandal with films Waterworld and Stargate, and adds that the media should make it clearer for younger people. At the end of the interview, Ali admits to not paying taxes.
* Mohamed Al-Fayed (1929–2023), former owner of Harrods and former chairman of Fulham F.C.
* Marlin Fitzwater (1942–), former White House Press Secretary to US presidents George H. W. Bush and Ronald Reagan: Ali asks Fitzwater &quot;was it embarrassing working as a secretary, did it have the stigmata as working as a male nurse&quot;. Ali G expresses his belief that men who use the words &quot;discussion&quot; and &quot;conflict&quot; are homosexuals. Fitzwater ends the interview after calling Ali G an idiot due to Ali asking if he knows any secrets and implying that Hillary Clinton was a lesbian.
* Jerome Friedman, MIT professor of physics and 1990 Nobel Prize winner
* John Kenneth Galbraith, economist and public intellectual
* Daryl Gates (1926–2010), former Los Angeles Police Chief: Shortly after the interview begins, Ali asks him &quot;what was it like being the head of the NYPD?&quot;. After Gates corrects him, Ali blames a language barrier as the cause of the misunderstanding, adding &quot;well you says tomato, I says potato&quot;. During the midst of the interview, Ali confuses O. J. Simpson for Homer Simpson. Ali asks for information regarding criminals who swallow condoms which contain drugs and pretends to write down the information given to him, implying that he will later use the information practically. At the end of the interview, Ali incorrectly refers to him as Bill Gates.
* Newt Gingrich (1943–), former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives: At the very beginning of the interview, he spends nearly one minute asking Gingrich how to spell and pronounce his name. Ali expresses his concern that if a female ever became President of the United States then she would spend too much time buying facial products, shopping and new shoes, also saying that a female president would elect George Clooney and Brad Pitt as part of the cabinet administration. Gingrich replies &quot;I think if you said that to most women who could be President, you&#x27;d be surprised how tough they are&quot; and also citing Margaret Thatcher as one of the three best prime ministers of the 20th century. Ali is also worried that a female elected president would start crying if the U.S. were at war and that she would &quot;get more and more hornier&quot; if a rival did &quot;bad things&quot; to the U.S. as &quot;women love bastards&quot;.
* Neil Hamilton, former Conservative politician.
* Kent Hovind (1953–), evangelist and Young Earth creationist: During the interview, Ali G repeatedly says &quot;shame on you&quot; to Hovind due to believing that he did not flush the toilet whilst backstage. Ali also believes that humans are descended from monkeys on the basis that Hovind admitted to eating a banana, according to Ali, his admission serves as proof. Ali then proceeds to shut down Hovind, telling him to &quot;speak to the hand because the face ain&#x27;t listening, yo&quot;.
* Richard James Kerr (1935–), deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency to George H. W. Bush: Ali G asked Kerr what kind of punishment should suicide terrorists face, after blowing themselves up. He also expresses his belief to Kerr that threatening suicide bombers with 20 years in prison may act as a deterrent.
* Glenn Hubbard, former professional baseball player
* John Humphrys, BBC presenter / journalist
* Derrick Hussey, publisher and proprietor of Hippocampus Press
* Reed Irvine, founder of Accuracy in Media
* Ernie Johnson Jr., sports broadcaster
* Steve Kerr, former American professional basketball player who, according to Ali G, works on &quot;TMT&quot;, and was the Most Valuable Player, or &quot;MP3&quot; of the NBA.
* C. Everett Koop (1916–2013), former Surgeon General of the United States to George H. W. Bush and Ronald Reagan: during the interview, Ali cannot comprehend why his erection is not actually a bone. He accuses Dr. Koop of being a &quot;player hater&quot; when the doctor breaks the news that all people will eventually die, and tries to convince the Surgeon General that his deceased pet cat was actually human. Ali suggests removing the organs out of the human body and replacing them with a mobile phone. He also asks why the human heartbeat is &quot;so old fashioned&quot;, and his &quot;homies&quot; would look after and respect their heart if they had a drum and bass heartbeat that they could relate to. Ali also asks the Surgeon General why all skeletons are involved in &quot;evil stuff.&quot;
* James Lipton (1926–2020), host of Bravo&#x27;s &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;. Ali G accuses Lipton of homosexual behavior because he cries while watching films. Lipton expresses that he hates the word &quot;hoe&quot; so Ali instead uses the word &quot;bitches&quot; to describe his opinion that women are better &quot;actors&quot; than men.
* Ralph Nader (1934–), consumer activist and former US presidential candidate for the Green Party in 1996 &amp; 2000: Ali wonders what is the big deal with saving the rainforest because he believes no one has ever lived there and there is not a KFC or McDonald&#x27;s nearby. After discovering that people do live there, he believes that one would have to be crazy to live there due to the danger of a monkey defecating on a person&#x27;s head. While talking about how to save money on electricity, unknown to Ali G, he admits to illegally rigging his home electrical meter and doing Nader a favor after he is &quot;well negative about it&quot;.
* Thomas J. Pickard, former acting FBI Director: Ali G asks Pickard if he knows what is in the basement of Studio 54, referring to the X-Files. After he acknowledges what he is implying, Ali hums the X-Files theme tune.
* Gail Porter, television presenter
* Sue Ramsey, Irish politician, Sinn Féin
* Sally Jessy Raphaël, former talk show host, (who congratulated him for &#x27;being himself&#x27;)
* Jacob Rees-Mogg (1969–), Conservative Party parliamentary candidate, investment banker and future MP for North East Somerset (2010–2024). Ali incorrectly addresses him as &quot;Lord Rees-Mogg&quot;. He asks him &quot;which class is Pakis in&quot; and wonders if he impregnated the daughter of a lord, which class would the baby belong to. During the interview, he borrows a top hat from Rees-Mogg, believing he would be upper-class if he wore it, Rees-Mogg compares him to Lord Snooty.
* Andy Rooney (1919–2011), of the CBS programme &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, who repeatedly corrects Ali G&#x27;s poor grammar, and responds angrily to Ali G&#x27;s foolish questions about the current state of the media. (It is worth noting that Ali G wonders whether the media would ever publish the results of a presidential election early; while Rooney dismisses this idea as preposterous, this is precisely what the Chicago Daily Tribune did in 1948, falsely reporting that Thomas E. Dewey had defeated Harry S. Truman). Rooney thus furiously and abruptly ends his interview, claiming a busy schedule. Ali G then characterizes Rooney&#x27;s treatment of him as &quot;racialist,&quot; using a British variant of the word &quot;racist,&quot; the former of which Rooney (an American) does not recognize as any type of real word.
* Charles Schultze, former Chief Economic Advisor to President Jimmy Carter
* Brent Scowcroft, former National Security Advisor and Air Force General
* Tomasz Starzewski (1961–), fashion designer: At the very beginning of the interview, Ali G thinks Starzewski&#x27;s suit is made out of vaginal hair. Starzewski was offended when Ali asked if he would make clothes for any woman, &quot;even if she has nice personality but a face like a rottweiler&#x27;s ass&quot;, believing that it would bring on shame for Starzewski&#x27;s clothing brand if he decided to make clothes for unattractive women. At the end of the interview, Ali assumed that he was happy when fashion designer, Gianni Versace, was murdered as &quot;there was less competition&quot;.
* Teddy Taylor (1937–2017), former MP for the Conservative Party: Ali expresses his belief that most countries in Europe are &quot;crap countries&quot;, he also thinks it is racist as a result of Jamaica not being part of Europe. He asks Taylor if himself will still be able to buy pornography &quot;with dogs and women&quot; and if that particular category will be available in the UK. At the end of the interview, Ali G suggests that if people want to join Europe then they should have a &quot;brian&quot;, referring to a human brain.
* Dick Thornburgh (1932–2020), former U.S. Attorney General and governor of Pennsylvania. While both men are discussing murder and the law, Ali believes it is justifiable to murder someone &quot;if they call your mum or nana a hoe&quot;. Ali has a hard time distinguishing the meaning of a &quot;hung jury&quot; and an erection, Thornburgh laughs and wishes he made it clearer for Ali. In the interview, he wonders if &quot;whoever smelt it deal it&quot;, in reference to farting, is a crime in the United States. He also believes if a prisoner on the death penalty is given a free meal then the person would be able to eat forever, subsequently avoiding the execution.
* Edwin Meese (1931–), former United States Attorney General and counsellor to President Ronald Reagan. Ali G is baffled that it is illegal to steal a person&#x27;s television but not their girlfriend, implying that a girlfriend should become property and even suggesting that the government should do something about it. After Meese discovers that he has been pranked, he agrees to say &quot;I was attorney general, my name is Meese, I say go to college and don&#x27;t carry a piece.&quot;
* Stansfield Turner (1923–2018), former director of Central Intelligence Agency: After Turner explains what the CIA stands for, Ali asks &quot;so does it help if you is intelligent if you want to get in&quot;, Ali believes it is &quot;racialist&quot; that the CIA will not hire stupid people. His concern and definition of racist is &quot;ain&#x27;t it unfair for those people who will feel bad inside if you won&#x27;t allow them in there&quot;, Turner immediately laughs and Ali questions his reason for laughing. Turner politely remarks that Ali is intelligent after asking if he could ever join the CIA. Ali believes that female undercover CIA agents have cameras attached to their vagina and that they wear uniforms whilst on special missions. At the end of the interview, he questions &quot;how do we actually know Louie Armstrong was actually stood on the moon&quot;, and he expresses his belief to Turner that Kevin Costner knew who murdered President JFK.
* Donald Trump (1946–), real estate developer and reality TV presenter; 45th and 47th president of the United States of America. In the interview lasting under two minutes, Ali G proposes a business idea to Trump: arguing that, although ice cream is &quot;the most popular thing in the world&quot;, it is flawed due to the ease with which it melts. Trump suggests that Ali is pitching him a &quot;drip-proof ice cream&quot;: which Ali denies, though praises the idea and urges Trump not to release such a product, to which he complies stating &quot;I promise you I won&#x27;t&quot;. Ali proceeds to pitch him the &quot;ice cream glove&quot;: a piece of hand-wear which Ali believes will prevent ice cream from dripping on one&#x27;s hands during consumption, to which Trump replies &quot;well, it sounds like a good idea and I hope you make a lot of money&quot; before walking off the set.
* Lindsay Urwin, the Bishop of Horsham.
* Gore Vidal (1925–2012), author and essayist (whom Ali G mistook for Vidal Sassoon).
* Christine Todd Whitman (1946–), first female and former New Jersey governor and United States Environmental Protection Agency administrator: Ali is concerned about solar energy and worries that the sun will run out of energy and fuel if humans continue to use solar energy, he adds that Alaska has already &quot;overused&quot; the sun as &quot;there is like darkness for months every year&quot;. After asking why the ocean is dirty, his proof is that fishes and whales are defecating too much and that humans should tell the fish not to defecate in the water.
* Sammy Wilson, Northern Irish politician, Democratic Unionist Party.
* Naomi Wolf (1962–), former political advisor to Bill Clinton and Al Gore, author and feminist: Ali expresses his concern that if women are granted human rights in the workplace then they will start asking for human rights at home. He also adds that men are the best cooks in the world and uses Colonel Sanders and Ronald McDonald as examples, compared to &quot;Wendy&quot;; the mascot of Wendy&#x27;s Fast-food Restaurant, Wolf surprisingly agrees with him. Ali baits Wolf by expressing his view that women have better job opportunities than men, such as lap dancers, extras in music videos and strippers. He gives Wolf a &quot;compliment&quot; by saying that she could possibly work as a prostitute due to her attractiveness.
* Heinz Wolff (1928–2017), scientist and former emeritus professor of bioengineering at Brunel University: Ali asks if &quot;knob enlargements&quot; are in correlation with science. He also asks &quot;is infinite a number&quot; and is unconvinced by Wolff&#x27;s explanation, repeatedly saying &quot;million&quot; and &quot;billion&quot; and asking if it is smaller than the given numbers. Wolff says that he could always add 1 to each given number, Ali ends the interview by saying &quot;and that number is infinity?&quot; To which Wolff replies &#x27;no&#x27;.
* Professional basketball players Steve Nash (who was an award-winning player &quot;MP3&quot; according to Ali G and unable to speak proper English due to being Canadian), Kobe Bryant (whom he asks about the number of springs in a basketball), Ben Wallace (who he accuses of &quot;playa-hating&quot;), Shaquille O&#x27;Neal (whom he argued with about the meaning of the NBA, Ali thinking it stood for Nationwide Basketball Society), Tim Duncan (from whom he tried to get a pair of free trainers), Robert Horry, Dwyane Wade (who he did not realise was an NBA player, claiming he had just &quot;sneaked in&quot; to &quot;hang with mah man Shaquille O&#x27;Neal&quot;), Richard Jefferson (whom he called Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s son), Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith and Reggie Miller.

<text>Meliaceae, the mahogany family, is a flowering plant family of mostly trees and shrubs (and a few herbaceous plants, mangroves) in the order Sapindales.

They are characterised by alternate, usually pinnate leaves without stipules, and by syncarpous, apparently bisexual (but actually mostly cryptically unisexual) flowers borne in panicles, cymes, spikes or clusters. Most species are evergreen, but some are deciduous, either in the dry season or in winter.

The family includes about 53 genera and about 600 known species, with a pantropical distribution; one genus (&quot;Toona&quot;) extends north into temperate China and south into southeast Australia, another (&quot;Synoum&quot;) into southeast Australia, and another (&quot;Melia&quot;) nearly as far north. They most commonly grow as understory trees in rainforests, but are also found in mangroves and arid regions.

The fossil record of the family extends back into the Late Cretaceous.

==Uses==

Various species are used for vegetable oil, soap-making, insecticides, and highly prized wood (mahogany).

Some economically important genera and species belong to this family:
*&quot;Azadirachta indica&quot;, neem tree (India)
*&quot;Carapa&quot;: includes the &quot;crabwood trees&quot; &quot;e.g. Carapa procera&quot; (South America and Africa)
*&quot;Cedrela odorata&quot; Central and South America; timber also known as Spanish-cedar
*&quot;Entandrophragma&quot;: includes sapele (&quot;Entandrophragma cylindricum&quot;), and &quot;utile&quot; or &quot;sipo&quot; (&quot;E. utile&quot;) of tropical Africa
*&quot;Guarea&quot;, the genus of &quot;Bossé&quot; or &quot;pink mahogany&quot;, includes: &quot;G. thompsonii&quot; and &quot;G. cedrata&quot; (Africa)
*&quot;Khaya&quot; includes: Ivory Coast Mahogany and Senegal Mahogany (tropical Africa)
*&quot;Lansium domesticum&quot;, lanzones, grown for its edible fruit in Southeast Asia
*&quot;Melia azedarach&quot;, Chinaberry or white cedar (Indomalaya and Australasia)
*&quot;Sandoricum koetjape&quot;, santol, grown for its edible fruit in Southeast Asia and South Asia
*&quot;Swietenia&quot; is the classic &quot;mahogany&quot; genus from the tropical Americas
*&quot;Toona&quot;: the genus of &quot;toon tree&quot; species (tropical Asia, Malesia, and Australia), especially &quot;Toona ciliata&quot;

== Genera ==

58 genera are currently accepted.
The family is divided into two subfamilies, Cedreloideae and Melioideae, which are supported by phylogenetic evidence.

=== Subfamily Cedreloideae ===
This is also known as subfamily Swietenioideae.

=== Subfamily Melioideae ===

<text>Sacha Noam Baron Cohen ( ; born 13 October 1971) is an English comedian, actor and performance artist. He has received various accolades throughout his career, including three Golden Globe Awards and two BAFTA TV Awards as well as nominations for three Academy Awards and six Primetime Emmy Awards. He&#x27;s best known for his creation and portrayal of the fictional satirical characters Ali G, Borat Sagdiyev, Brüno Gehard, and Admiral General Haffaz Aladeen. 

Baron Cohen began his career in television late-night series &quot;The 11 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot; (1998–1999) before creating and starring as his character Ali G in the satirical sketch comedy show &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot; (2000–2004) where he received two British Academy Television Awards. He created and starred in the Showtime satirical mockumentary series &quot;Who Is America?&quot; (2018) for which he earned a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy. He portrayed Eli Cohen in the Netflix limited series &quot;The Spy&quot; (2019) earning a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film nomination, and acted in the Apple TV+ limited series &quot;Disclaimer&quot; (2024).

Baron Cohen wrote and starred in &quot;Borat&quot; (2006) and &quot;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm&quot; (2020), which earned him the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy as well as a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. For his portrayal of Abbie Hoffman in the legal drama &quot;The Trial of the Chicago 7&quot; (2020) he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He also wrote, produced and acted in the comedy films &quot;Ali G Indahouse&quot; (2002), &quot;Brüno&quot; (2009), &quot;The Dictator&quot; (2012), and &quot;Grimsby&quot; (2016) as has acted in drama films such as &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; (2007), &quot;Hugo&quot; (2011), and &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (2012).

He voiced King Julien XIII in the &quot;Madagascar&quot; film series (2005–2012) and Uncle Ugo in &quot;Luca&quot; (2021). He has been a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in the Actors Branch since 2008.

==Early life and education ==
Sacha Noam Baron Cohen was born into an English family of Ashkenazi Jewish descent in the Hammersmith area of London on 13 October 1971. His mother, photographer Daniella (née Weiser), was born in British Mandatory Palestine in 1939. His father, editor-turned-clothing store owner Gerald &quot;Jerry&quot; Baron Cohen (1932–2016), was born into a Belarusian Ashkenazi Jewish family in London and grew up in the Welsh town of Pontypridd. Baron Cohen&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Morris Moses Cohen, added &quot;Baron&quot; to his surname. His maternal grandmother, Liesel (née Levi), lived in Haifa and trained as a ballet dancer in Germany before fleeing the Nazis in 1936. He has two older brothers: Erran, a composer with whom he often collaborates, and Amnon. His cousins include autism researcher Sir Simon Baron-Cohen, playwright Dan Baron Cohen, and filmmaker Ash Baron-Cohen.

Baron Cohen was first educated at the independent Catholic St Columba&#x27;s College in St Albans, before moving on to attend the independent Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Boys&#x27; School in Elstree. He then studied history with a focus on antisemitism at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, graduating in 1993 with upper-second-class honours. As an undergraduate, he wrote his thesis on the role of Jewish activists in the American civil rights movement. He was a member of the Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club, where he performed in shows such as &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; and &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, as well as acted in shows with the Labour youth movement Habonim Dror. He played the cello while growing up, and made his television debut as a cellist on &quot;Fanfare for Young Musicians&quot;.

==Career==
===Early roles===
Baron Cohen grew up as a fan of Monty Python and Peter Cook, but his greatest comedic influence was Peter Sellers, whom he saw as &quot;this incredibly realistic actor, who was also hilarious and who managed to bridge the gap between comedy and satire&quot;. Known for portraying a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, Sellers was referred to by Baron Cohen as &quot;the most seminal force in shaping [his] early ideas on comedy&quot;. After leaving university, Baron Cohen worked for a time as a fashion model. By the early 1990s, he was hosting a weekly programme on Windsor cable television&#x27;s local broadcasts with Carol Kirkwood, who later became a BBC weather forecaster. In 1995, Channel 4 was planning a replacement for its series &quot;The Word&quot;, and disseminated an open call for new television presenters. Baron Cohen sent in a tape of himself, which caught the attention of a producer. Baron Cohen hosted &quot;Pump TV&quot; from 1995 to 1996.

In 1996, Baron Cohen began presenting the youth chat programme &quot;F2F&quot; for Granada Talk TV and had a small role in an advertisement for McCain Microchips, as a chef in a commercial entitled &quot;Ping Pong&quot;. He took clown training in Paris, at the École Philippe Gaulier, studying under master-clown Philippe Gaulier. Of his former pupil, Gaulier says: &quot;He was a good clown, full of spirit&quot; while Baron Cohen remarks of Gaulier, &quot;Without him, I really do doubt whether I would have had any success in my field&quot;. He left TV journalist Rob Burley a note reading &quot;Dear Rob, good luck baby, have fun and things, see you soon, Sacha.&quot;, when Burley left the programme. Baron Cohen made his first feature film appearance in the British comedy &quot;The Jolly Boys&#x27; Last Stand&quot; (2000). Also in 2000, he played the part of Super Greg for a series of TV advertisements for Lee Jeans; the advertisements never aired, but the website for Super Greg created an internet sensation. 

===Characters===
====Ali G====

Baron Cohen appeared during two-minute sketches as his fashion reporter Brüno on the Paramount Comedy Channel during 1998. He shot to fame with his comic character Ali G, a fictional stereotype of a British suburban male &quot;chav&quot; who imitates urban black British hip hop culture and British Jamaican culture, as well as speaking in rude boy-style English with borrowed expressions from Jamaican Patois. Hailing from Staines (a suburban town in Surrey, to the west of London), Ali G started appearing on the British television show &quot;The 11 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot; on Channel 4, which first aired on 8 September 1998. A year after the première of the show, &quot;GQ&quot; named Baron Cohen comedian of the year. He won Best Newcomer at the 1999 British Comedy Awards, and at the British Academy Television Awards he was nominated for Best British Entertainment Performance.

&quot;Da Ali G Show&quot; began in 2000, and won the BAFTA for Best Comedy in the following year. Also in 2000, Baron Cohen as Ali G appeared as the limousine driver in Madonna&#x27;s 2000 video &quot;Music&quot;, directed by Jonas Åkerlund, who was also responsible for directing the titles for &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot;. Baron Cohen is a supporter of the UK charity telethon Comic Relief, which is broadcast on the BBC, and as Ali G interviewed David Beckham and wife Victoria in 2001.

In a 2001 Channel 4 poll Ali G was ranked eighth on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. In 2002, Ali G was the central character in the feature film &quot;Ali G Indahouse&quot;, in which he is elected to the British Parliament and foils a plot to bulldoze a community centre in his home town, Staines. His television show was exported to the United States in 2003, with new episodes set there, for HBO.

At the 2012 British Comedy Awards, 13 years after winning Best Newcomer at the 1999 Comedy Awards, Baron Cohen accepted the Outstanding Achievement Award from Sir Ben Kingsley in the guise of Ali G, and stated: &quot;I is grown up now. I ain&#x27;t living in my nan&#x27;s house any more. I is living in her garage.&quot; In 2013, he received the BAFTA Charlie Chaplin Britannia Award for Excellence in Comedy.

Ali G&#x27;s interviews with notable figures (especially politicians) gained notoriety partly because the subjects were not aware that Ali G, rather than being a real interviewer, was a comedic character. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, Baron Cohen would always enter the interview area dressed as Ali G, carrying equipment while acting like an inconspicuous crew member. The crew would be accompanied by a man in a suit and tie, leading the subject to believe that this was the person who would interview them. Baron Cohen, as Ali G, would sit down to ask the interviewee some preliminary questions to give them the impression that this was a test run before the well-dressed man conducted the real interview; this continued until a few moments before the cameras started filming, revealing the suited man as the director and Ali G as the interviewer, granting Baron Cohen the element of surprise as the interviewee would be less likely to opt out of the interview so close to its start.

====Borat Sagdiyev====
The Kazakh journalist Borat Sagdiyev was first developed for short skits on &quot;F2F&quot; on Granada Television in the UK that Baron Cohen presented in 1996–1997, with the character at this time being known as Alexi Krickler. The character remained dormant while Baron Cohen concentrated on his Ali G persona, but with the subsequent success of Ali G, Baron Cohen revisited his Borat character. The character was featured in segments of &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot;. Borat&#x27;s sense of humour derives from his mocking of society through outrageous sociocultural viewpoints, his deadpan violation of social taboos and use of vulgar language and behaviour.

&quot;&quot;, a feature film with Borat Sagdiyev at the centre, was screened at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival and released in the United Kingdom on 2 November 2006, in the United States on 3 November 2006 and Australia 23 November 2006. The film follows Sagdiyev as he and his colleague Azamat Bagatov travel the US to produce a documentary about life in the country, as all the while Sagdiyev attempts to enter into marriage with celebrity Pamela Anderson. The film is a mockumentary which includes interviews with various Americans that poke fun at American culture, as well as sexism, racism, homophobia, antisemitism and jingoism. It debuted at the No. 1 spot in the US, taking in an estimated $26.4 million in just 837 theatres averaging $31,600 per theatre.

Baron Cohen won the 2007 Golden Globe for Best Actor – Musical or Comedy, his sixth such award. Although Borat was up for &quot;Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy&quot;, the film lost to &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;. On 23 January 2007, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. He shared his nomination with the film&#x27;s co-writers, Ant Hines, Peter Baynham, Dan Mazer and Todd Phillips.

Aside from the comic elements of his characters, Baron Cohen&#x27;s performances are interpreted by some as reflecting uncomfortable truths about his audience. He juxtaposes his own Jewish heritage with the anti-Semitism of his character Borat.

In 2007, Baron Cohen published a travel guide as Borat, with dual titles: &quot;Borat: Touristic Guidings To Minor Nation of U.S. and A.&quot; and &quot;Borat: Touristic Guidings To Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan&quot;. On 21 December 2007, Baron Cohen announced he was retiring the character of Borat. After the release of &quot;Borat&quot;, Baron Cohen said he would retire Borat and Ali G because the public had become too familiar with the characters. After the release of &quot;Brüno&quot;, he said he would retire that character.

The character was brought back on a 2018 appearance on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&quot; and appears in the 2020 sequel &quot;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm&quot;, for which he won another Golden Globe Award, as well as the 2022 Kennedy Center Honors where he did a standup routine as Borat for the induction of U2.

====Brüno Gehard====

Another alter ego Sacha Baron Cohen performed as is &quot;Brüno&quot;, a flamboyantly gay Austrian fashion show presenter who often lures his unwitting subjects into making provocative statements and engaging in embarrassing behaviour, as well as leading them to contradict themselves, often in the same interview. Brüno&#x27;s main comedic satire pertains to the vacuity and inanity of the fashion and clubbing world. Brüno asks the subjects to answer &quot;yes or no&quot; questions with either &quot;Vassup&quot; (What&#x27;s up) or &quot;Ich don&#x27;t think so&quot; (I don&#x27;t think so); these are occasionally substituted with &quot;Ach, ja!&quot; (Ah yes!) or &quot;Nicht, nicht&quot; (&quot;Nicht&quot; means &quot;no&quot; or &quot;not&quot; in German). In one segment on &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot;, he encouraged his guest to answer questions with either &quot;Keep them in the ghetto&quot; or &quot;Train to Auschwitz&quot;.

In May 2009, at the MTV Movie Awards, Baron Cohen appeared as Brüno wearing a white angel costume, a white jockstrap, white go-go boots, and white wings; and did an aerial stunt where he dropped from a height (using wires) onto Eminem. Baron Cohen landed with his face on Eminem&#x27;s crotch and with his crotch in Eminem&#x27;s face, prompting Eminem to exit the venue with fellow rappers D12. Eminem later admitted to staging the stunt with Baron Cohen.

After an intense bidding war that included such Hollywood powerhouses as DreamWorks, Sony, and 20th Century Fox, Universal Pictures won and paid a reported $42.5 million for the film rights to a collection of interviews Baron Cohen performed as the character Brüno. To create these interviews a number of shill companies and websites were created to draw potential interviewees by creating an illusion of legitimacy. The film was released in July 2009.

====Admiral General Aladeen====
Baron Cohen&#x27;s 2012 film, &quot;The Dictator&quot;, was described by its press as &quot;the heroic story of a dictator who risked his life to ensure that democracy would never come to the country he so lovingly oppressed&quot;. Baron Cohen played Admiral General Aladeen, a dictator from a fictional country called the Republic of Wadiya. &quot;Borat&quot; and &quot;Brüno&quot; film director Larry Charles directed the film. The main target of the film&#x27;s satire was Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, who was still alive when the film was written. The producers of the film were concerned it would anger Gaddafi, possibly even resulting in a terrorist attack, so they released deliberate misinformation saying that the film was loosely based on a romance novel written by former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.

On 26 February 2012, Baron Cohen claimed he was banned from attending the 84th Academy Awards in his role as Admiral General Aladeen but the rumour was denied by the Academy, saying &quot;we haven&#x27;t banned him, he is lying&quot; but made it clear that &quot;Cohen is not welcome to use the red carpet as a platform for a promotional stunt&quot;. Baron Cohen eventually appeared at the awards&#x27; red carpet with a pair of uniformed female bodyguards, holding an urn which he claimed was filled with the ashes of Kim Jong-il. The &quot;ashes&quot;, which Baron Cohen admitted to Howard Stern on the Tuesday, 8 May 2012 episode of &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; was flour, were &quot;accidentally&quot; spilt onto Ryan Seacrest.

===&quot;Who Is America?&quot;===
Baron Cohen portrays various characters in &quot;Who Is America?&quot;, including Erran Morad, an Israeli anti-terrorism expert. The character is referred to as a colonel (and later captain, general, major, sergeant, brigadier, sergeant corporal and lieutenant) in the Israeli military and a former agent of Mossad (or &quot;not in the Mossad&quot;, as he often interjects). Before &quot;Who Is America?&quot; aired on Showtime, some conservative public figures made statements saying that Baron Cohen had deceived them while in character. Hours before the premiere, Showtime uploaded the &quot;Kinderguardians&quot; segment on their YouTube channel, in which Morad explains to Philip Van Cleave, the president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, of the proposal of a new program where children ages 3 to 16 are armed with guns. He also interviews other conservatives, such as Dana Rohrabacher, Joe Wilson, and Joe Walsh, who are openly supportive. Only Matt Gaetz expresses skepticism of Morad&#x27;s proposal and declines to be in his video.

In the second episode, Morad teaches Jason Spencer, a Republican state representative from Georgia, how to detect and repel terrorists by taking pictures up a woman&#x27;s burqa with a selfie stick, walking backwards while baring his buttocks, and yelling racial epithets. After the airing of the episode, Spencer initially refused to step down, stating that he was exploited by the producers. In May 2018, Spencer lost his primary to a political novice, Steven Sainz, but was expected to serve the rest of his term until November. He eventually did step down on 31 July 2018, leaving the seat vacant.

Baron Cohen has denied &quot;Who is America?&quot; will return for a second season, noting the publicity surrounding the show and his interviews would make it harder for him to dupe guests.

===Other work===
Baron Cohen guest-starred in the fifth season of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, with Dustin Hoffman, as a guide to Heaven. He also provided the voice of the ring-tailed lemur king, King Julien, in DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s film series, &quot;Madagascar&quot;, and appeared as Will Ferrell&#x27;s arch rival, the French Formula One speed demon Jean Girard, in the hit &quot;Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot; (2006). He also appeared alongside Johnny Depp in the film &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; (2007) as Signor Adolfo Pirelli, co-starred in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s adventure film &quot;Hugo&quot; (2011), and portrayed Thénardier in the 2012 film version of the musical &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. He appeared as a BBC News Anchor in &quot;Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues&quot; (2013).

Baron Cohen has twice presented the MTV Europe Music Awards, first as Ali G on 8 November 2001, in Frankfurt, Germany, and then as Borat on 3 November 2005 in Lisbon, Portugal. Baron Cohen appeared out of character to accept an award at the British Comedy Awards in December 2006. He said at the time that Borat could not make it to the awards as &quot;he&#x27;s guest of honour at the Holocaust denial conference in Tehran&quot;, referring to the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust.

In September 2010, representatives for Baron Cohen confirmed that he was set to play Freddie Mercury in the &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; biopic about the rock singer. He dropped out of the project in July 2013, citing &quot;creative differences&quot; between him and the surviving members of Queen. Queen guitarist Brian May later said that even though the band and Baron Cohen were on good terms, they felt that his presence would be &quot;distracting&quot;. The role was later played by Rami Malek. Baron Cohen shot a spread with model Alessandra Ambrosio for &quot;Marie Claire&quot; magazine to promote the film &quot;Brüno&quot;. In 2010, Baron Cohen guest-starred in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode, &quot;The Greatest Story Ever D&#x27;ohed&quot;, as Jakob, a quick-tempered Israeli tour guide.

In 2012, Baron Cohen and his production company Four By Two Films signed a first-look deal with Paramount Pictures, and the deal was renewed in 2014 for three years and a two-film commitment. In Baron Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Grimsby&quot; (2016; &quot;The Brothers Grimsby&quot; in the US), he plays the football hooligan brother of a British MI6 spy. The film received mixed reviews from critics and was a failure at the box office.

Baron Cohen portrayed political activist/anarchist Abbie Hoffman in the drama &quot;The Trial of the Chicago 7&quot;, with Aaron Sorkin writing and directing. The film was released in September 2020 to positive reviews. He is set to star opposite Keke Palmer in the David O. Russell film &quot;Super Toys&quot;.

== Activism ==
=== Philanthropy ===
Baron Cohen is a campaigner and philanthropist. He has donated to numerous causes and children&#x27;s charities in countries including Syria, Lebanon, Sudan, Yemen &amp; Somalia. He is a founding member of Stop Hate For Profit, a vocal critic of social media companies, and has spoken publicly against racism, antisemitism, and online hate speech.

On 28 December 2015, Baron Cohen and his wife, Australian actress Isla Fisher, donated £335,000 ($500,000) to Save the Children as part of a programme to vaccinate children in northern Syria against measles; they donated the same amount to the International Rescue Committee, also aimed at helping Syrian refugees. Baron Cohen has also donated to support children and families in Somalia during a severe hunger crisis, and funded the building of a maternity hospital in Hodeidah, Yemen.

In 2019, Baron Cohen was awarded the Anti-Defamation League&#x27;s International Leadership Award for opposing bigotry and prejudice. In accepting the award, Baron Cohen gave an impassioned speech directing criticism at internet companies, singling out Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter as part of &quot;the biggest propaganda machine in history&quot; and claiming that their rules on hate speech meant &quot;they would have let Hitler buy ads&quot;.

In 2020, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher partnered with Marc Benioff to send a planeload of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to National Health Service workers in the UK.

In August 2023, Baron Cohen spoke alongside Martin Luther King III and Rev. Al Sharpton at the 60th Anniversary of the March on Washington.

In October 2024, Baron Cohen donated $500,000 to Save the Children and the International Rescue Committee to help support their work tackling a displacement crisis and famine in Sudan, and called for more aid to support the cause.
===Politics===
In 2023, he was one of the actors to sign an open letter to President Biden calling for the release of all hostages taken by Hamas.

In October 2023, Baron Cohen was among the members of the Writers Guild of America that called out its guild leaders for not speaking in support of Israel during the Israel-Hamas War in Gaza.

In November 2023, Baron Cohen was among more than a dozen creators and celebrities who challenged TikTok executives on the subject of content moderation and the safety of Jewish users amidst the early stages of the Israel-Hamas War.

==In the media==
===Public persona===
For much of the early part of his career, Baron Cohen avoided doing interviews out of character. However, in 2004, he did the talk show circuit appearing as himself on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;The Opie and Anthony Show&quot;, &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, and others to promote the forthcoming season of his show on HBO. He was also interviewed on NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot; and did an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, published in November 2006, that the magazine labelled as &quot;his only interview as himself&quot;. He also appeared in an interview out of character with Terry Gross on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Air&quot; on 4 January 2007.

&quot;Borat&quot; director Larry Charles explains that Baron Cohen generally appears in character partly to &quot;protect his weakness&quot;, by focusing public interest on his characters rather than himself. His other reason, &quot;Newsweek&quot; claims, is that Baron Cohen is fiercely private: &quot;...according to the UK press, his publicists denied that he attended a party for the London premiere of &quot;Borat&quot; and that a party even occurred&quot;.

Baron Cohen was featured in the Time 100 list for 2007.

&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; 6 November 2006 issue contains a column called &quot;Skater vs. Instigator&quot;, which illustrates various amusing &quot;parallels&quot; between Baron Cohen and figure skater Sasha Cohen, ranging from their mutually held personal significance of the number 4 to their shared romantic interests in redheads.

In 2018, &quot;The Times&quot; named him among the 30 best living comedians.

===Controversies, criticism and lawsuits===
Baron Cohen has been criticized for the racist or prejudiced comments his characters have made. HBO spokesman Quentin Schaffer replied to the criticism and said, &quot;Through his alter-egos, [Baron Cohen] delivers an obvious satire that exposes people&#x27;s ignorance and prejudice in much the same way &quot;All in the Family&quot; did years ago.&quot; Regarding his portrayal as the anti-Semitic Borat, Baron Cohen says the segments are a &quot;dramatic demonstration of how racism feeds on dumb conformity, as much as rabid bigotry&quot; rather than a display of racism by Baron Cohen himself. He said, &quot;Borat essentially works as a tool. By himself being anti-Semitic, he lets people lower their guard and expose their own prejudice.&quot; Addressing the same topic in an NPR interview with Robert Siegel, he said, &quot;People really let down their guard with [Borat] because they&#x27;re in a room with somebody who seems to have these outrageous opinions. They sometimes feel much more relaxed about letting their own outrageous, politically incorrect, prejudiced opinions come out.&quot; Baron Cohen said he also wishes in particular to expose the role of indifference in the Holocaust: &quot;When I was in university, there was this major historian of the Third Reich, Ian Kershaw, who said, &#x27;The path to Auschwitz was paved with indifference.&#x27; I know it&#x27;s not very funny being a comedian talking about the Holocaust, but it&#x27;s an interesting idea that not everyone in Germany had to be a raving anti-Semite. They just had to be apathetic.&quot; Regarding the enthusiastic response to his song &quot;In My Country There Is Problem&quot; (also known as &quot;Throw the Jew Down the Well&quot;), he said, &quot;Did it reveal that [the cheering audience] were anti-Semitic? Perhaps. But maybe it just revealed that they were indifferent to anti-Semitism.&quot;

In an interview with former Tory MP politician Neil Hamilton in 2000, Ali G offered Hamilton what was allegedly cannabis, which Hamilton accepted and smoked, creating some minor controversy in the British media.

The government of Kazakhstan threatened Baron Cohen with legal action following the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards ceremony in Lisbon, and the authority in charge of the country&#x27;s country-code top-level domain name removed the website that he had created for his character Borat (previously: http://www.borat.kz) for alleged violation of the law—specifically, registering for the domain under a false name. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, among others, has reported that Baron Cohen (in character as Borat) replied: &quot;I&#x27;d like to state that I have no connection with Mr. Cohen and fully support my government decision to sue this Jew&quot;. He was, however, defended by Dariga Nazarbayeva, a politician and the daughter of Kazakhstan&#x27;s then-President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who stated, &quot;We should not be afraid of humour and we shouldn&#x27;t try to control everything...&quot;. The deputy foreign minister of Kazakhstan later invited Baron Cohen to visit the country, stating that he could learn that &quot;women drive cars, wine is made of grapes, and Jews are free to go to synagogues&quot;. After the success of the &quot;Borat&quot; film, the Kazakh government, including the president, altered their stance on Baron Cohen&#x27;s parody, tacitly recognising the valuable press coverage the controversy created for their country.

At the 2006 MTV Movie Awards, Borat introduced Gnarls Barkley&#x27;s performance of &quot;Crazy&quot;, where he made a comment about Jessica Simpson, saying that he liked her mouth and that he could see it clearly through her denim pants.

At the 2006 UK premiere of &quot;Borat&quot;, he arrived in Leicester Square in a cart pulled by a mule and a number of &quot;Kazakh women,&quot; announcing: &quot;Good evening, gentleman and prostitutes. After this, I stay in a hotel in Kings Cross. We will all drink, wrestle with no clothes on and shoot dogs from the window&quot;.

Two of the three University of South Carolina students who appear in &quot;Borat&quot; sued the filmmakers, alleging that they were duped into signing release forms while drunk, and that false promises were made that the footage was for a documentary that would never be screened in the US. On 11 December 2006, a Los Angeles judge denied the pair a restraining order to remove them from the film. The lawsuit was dismissed in February 2007.

On 26 September 2008, Baron Cohen walked onto the runway during the Ágatha Ruiz de la Prada fashion show in Milan. In-character as Brüno, he was wearing a costume made of velcro. He appeared on the stage with a blanket and items of clothing stuck to his velcro suit. Lights were turned off while security intervened and escorted him off the stage, and the fashion show resumed normally shortly thereafter. Baron Cohen and his team had allegedly accessed the fashion show using fake IDs.

On 22 May 2009, a charity worker at a seniors&#x27; bingo game sued Baron Cohen, claiming an incident shot for &quot;Brüno&quot; at a charity bingo tournament left her disabled. However, the worker later retracted her statement, saying the &quot;actor never struck her&quot;, but that he &quot;beat her down emotionally to the point she&#x27;s now confined to a wheelchair&quot;. The scene did not make the final cut for the film. The case was dismissed in late November 2009 on Anti-SLAPP grounds, with all lawyer&#x27;s fees to be paid by the charity worker. The dismissal was appealed and upheld on 12 September 2011.

On 30 April 2010, Palestinian Christian grocer Ayman Abu Aita, of the West Bank and former member of Fatah, filed a lawsuit against Baron Cohen, alleging that he had been defamed by false accusations that he was a terrorist in the movie &quot;Bruno&quot;. Aita included David Letterman in the suit based on comments made during a 7 July 2009 appearance by Baron Cohen on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. Unlike the other lawsuits, Aita did not sign a release form, and his case centred around whether Baron Cohen&#x27;s portrayal of Aita was false, not whether he was defrauded. In September 2012, the defamation claim was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount, and the court case was dismissed.

In 2018, former Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama sued Baron Cohen for $95 million relating to a mock interview in &quot;Who is America?&quot; and allegations of paedophilia. On 13 July 2021, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the lawsuit after finding that Moore had signed a consent agreement barring his claims. Moore has filed notice of his intent to appeal the decision. On 8 July 2022, Baron Cohen defeated the lawsuit.

In June 2020, Baron Cohen crashed the right-wing &quot;March for Our Rights 3&quot; protest in Olympia, Washington, a counter-protest to the March for Our Lives demonstration as a result of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Disguised under heavy make-up, Baron Cohen sang a song telling listeners to attack liberals, CNN, the World Health Organization, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates and &quot;mask-wearers&quot;. The crowd, which initially sang along, realized they were being pranked when counter-protestors recognized Baron Cohen and began laughing. Baron Cohen&#x27;s security stopped the organizers from taking him off stage and turning off the power, and Baron Cohen was forced to flee in a private ambulance from the crowd. The incident was later revealed to have been organized as part of filming for &quot;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm&quot;, with Baron Cohen in-character as Borat in disguise.

==Personal life==
Baron Cohen first met Australian actress Isla Fisher at a party in Sydney in 2001, and they became engaged in 2004. She later converted to Judaism, and they were married in a Jewish ceremony on 15 March 2010 in Milan and Paris. They have two daughters (born 2007 and 2010) and a son (born 2015). They previously divided their time between the Marylebone district of London and the Laurel Canyon neighbourhood of Los Angeles, before settling in Sydney. On 5 April 2024, they jointly revealed that they had filed for divorce at the end of 2023.

Baron Cohen has said of his Jewish identity, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say I am a religious Jew. I am proud of my Jewish identity and there are certain things I do and customs I keep.&quot; He tries to keep kosher, attends synagogue about twice a year, and is fluent in Hebrew. He first acted in theatrical productions with the Labour youth movement Habonim Dror. He spent a year in Israel as a kibbutz volunteer at Rosh HaNikra and Beit HaEmek as part of the Shnat Habonim Dror, also taking part in the programme Machon L&#x27;Madrichei Chutz La&#x27;Aretz for Jewish youth movement leaders.

<text>Staines-upon-Thames, also known simply as Staines, is a market town in northwest Surrey, England, around west of central London. It is in the Borough of Spelthorne, at the confluence of the River Thames and Colne. Historically part of Middlesex, the town was transferred to Surrey in 1965. Staines is close to Heathrow Airport and is linked to the national motorway network by the M25 and M3. The town is part of the Greater London Built-up Area.

The earliest evidence of human activity in the area is from the Paleolithic and, during the Neolithic, there was a causewayed enclosure on Staines Moor. The first bridge across the Thames at Staines is thought to have been built by the Romans and there was a settlement in the area around the modern High Street by the end of the 1st century CE. Throughout the Middle Ages, Staines was primarily an agricultural settlement and was held by Westminster Abbey. The first surviving record of a market is from 1218, but one may have taken place near St Mary&#x27;s Church in the Anglo-Saxon period.

The industrialisation of Staines began in the mid-17th century when Thomas Ashby established a brewery in the town. Improvements to the local transport network in the mid-19th century also stimulated an expansion of the local population. The current Staines Bridge, designed by George Rennie, was opened in 1832 by William IV and the first railway line through Staines opened in 1848. The town became a centre for linoleum manufacture in 1864, when Frederick Walton established a factory on the site of the 13th-century Hale Mill.

At the end of the 20th century, Staines became infamous as the home town of the fictional film and television character, Ali G. Although many local residents felt that the town&#x27;s reputation was suffering through its association with the character, Sacha Baron Cohen, the creator of Ali G, praised Staines for being a &quot;lovely, leafy, middle-class suburb... where swans swim under the beautiful bridge&quot;. Partly in response to the reaction to the character, Spelthorne Borough Council voted in 2011 to add the suffix &quot;upon-Thames&quot; to the name.

==Toponymy==
The earliest document to refer to Staines is the Antonine Itinerary, thought to have been written in the early 3rd century AD, in which the location appears as &quot;Pontibus&quot;, meaning &quot;at the bridges&quot;. The first surviving records of Staines from the post-Roman period are from 1066, when the settlement appears in two separate charters as &quot;Stana&quot; and &quot;Stane&quot;. In Domesday Book of 1086, the settlement is referred to as &quot;Stanes&quot;. It later appears as &quot;Stanis&quot; (1167), &quot;Stanys&quot; (1428), &quot;Steynys&quot; and &quot;Staynys&quot; (1535), before the modern spelling &quot;Staines&quot; is first used in 1578. The name derives from the Old English &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;stone&quot;, and may refer to a Roman milestone on the London to Silchester road that survived into the early Anglo-Saxon period.

In order to promote the town&#x27;s &quot;riverside image&quot; and to distance it from its association with the fictional character, Ali G, Spelthorne Borough Council voted in December 2011 to change its name from &quot;Staines&quot; to &quot;Staines-upon-Thames&quot;. The formal renaming ceremony, conducted by the Lord Lieutenant of Surrey, Dame Sarah Goad, took place on 20 May 2012. The Royal Mail adopted the new name in mid-2013.

==Geography==
===Location===

Staines-upon-Thames is in northwest Surrey, around from central London. It is close to the borders of Berkshire and Greater London. The town is linked to junction 13 of the M25 by the A30 and to the M3 by the A308. The area surrounding the borough council offices and the magistrates&#x27; courts, to the southeast of the town centre, is known as Knowle Green. Egham Hythe, also in Surrey, is on the south side of the Thames and is linked to Staines by Staines Bridge.

Staines town centre is close to the confluence of the rivers Colne and Thames. A former millstream, known as Sweeps Ditch, ran to the east of the High Street, but much of its course was diverted underground in the 20th century. Severe flooding events have taken place in Staines in 1894, 1947, and 2014.

===Topography and geology===
Much of the town is built on gravel &quot;islands&quot; that rise above the low-lying floodplains of the Thames and Colne. These gravel deposits have a typical maximum elevation of above ordnance datum (AOD) and are as little as above the surrounding floodplain. Staines High Street, oriented northeast to southwest, runs across one of these islands to the site of the medieval bridge and was the nucleus of the Roman town. St Mary&#x27;s Church, on &quot;Binbury island&quot; to the northwest of the centre, is thought to have been the focus of settlement activity in the late-Saxon period. Elevations below AOD were liable to flooding until the early 19th century and many areas of gravel are covered by muddy silts and sands. There are brickearth deposits to the east of the town, along the A30, and outcrops of alluvium to the north and south.

==History==
===Early history===
The earliest evidence of human activity in Staines is from the Paleolithic. Flint blades, along with reindeer and horse bone fragments, have been found during excavations at Church Lammas, to the west of the town centre. During the Mesolithic, the area around Staines is thought to have been covered with a dense pine and birch forest. A Neolithic causewayed enclosure, about west of St Mary&#x27;s Church, was identified by aerial photography in 1959. The site, on a gravel island in the Colne river delta, AOD, consisted of two concentric, ditches, with a probable main entrance at the southeastern side. Pottery sherds and worked flints were found on the site, as well as fragments of human bone. Other Neolithic artefacts from the local area include fragments of a jadeite axe, discovered on Staines Moor in the early 1980s, tentatively dated to BCE.

Deverel–Rimbury pottery from the Church Lammas lands indicates that the Staines area was settled in the Bronze Age and a roundhouse from the same period has been identified at Laleham. Two round barrow ring ditches, one of which had a cremation burial at the centre, were found at Knowle Green in 2021. A further ring ditch, around in diameter, was found during excavations of the Majestic House site, close to the eastern end of the High Street. A Bronze Age field system at Hengrove Farm was also cultivated during the Iron Age, but fell out of use around the start of the Roman period. There is also evidence of an early Iron Age enclosure on Staines Moor and finds from the site include pottery sherds, flints and animal bones, with evidence of burning having taken place there. Since Staines is located on the low-lying floodplain of the Thames, it is likely that historical flooding events have destroyed much of the archaeological evidence of pre-Roman human activity in the town centre.

===Roman and Saxon===
The Roman road from London to Silchester crossed the Thames in the Staines area. Both the Thames and Colne are thought to have had multiple channels during this period, which may have necessitated the building of more than one bridge. There was a settlement in the area surrounding the modern High Street and, although the date of its foundation is uncertain, the earliest archaeological evidence is from 5496 AD, corresponding to the reign of Nero and the period of the Flavian Dynasty.
By the mid-2nd century, Staines had increased in size and prosperity and the early Romano-British roundhouses had been replaced by stone buildings with flint and rag-stone foundations. Fragments of painted, plastered wall and floors of &quot;opus signinum&quot; have been uncovered, and the presence of &quot;tesserae&quot; indicates that at least one building had a mosaic floor. A collyrium stamp, found during an excavation of 7375 High Street, suggests that there was a healer living in the town, who could have administered to the wider local population. Staines declined towards the end of the 2nd century, possibly as a result of an increased incidence of winter flooding. Nevertheless, Romano-British settlement activity continued until the early 4th century, although the town appears to have been smaller and less important than it had been in the first half of the Roman period.

Following the end of Roman rule in Britain, the main settlement at Staines appears to have shifted from the High Street area to the Binbury area surrounding St Mary&#x27;s Church. Archaeological evidence, including pits, ditches and pottery sherds suggests that there was a permanent settlement in this area by the mid-Saxon period and there may have been a marketplace at the northern end of Church Street. Staines may have been a fortified &quot;burh&quot; and the location of a minster church. A late-Saxon execution cemetery on London Road, containing the incomplete remains of up to thirty skeletons, suggests that the town was also an important local centre for the administration of justice.

For much of the early Saxon period, the Thames through Staines marked the border between Middlesex (to the north) and Surrey (to the south). In the 9th century, the river was used by Danish Viking raiders to travel into the heart of England. In 993, the Norwegian King, Olaf Tryggvason, sailed up the Thames to Staines with a fleet of 93 ships. In 1009, a large army of Vikings attacked Oxford and retreated back along the banks of the Thames, crossing the river at Staines.

===Governance===
Between 1042 and 1052, Edward the Confessor rebuilt Westminster Abbey as a royal burial church and endowed it with around 60 estates in the south east of England. Staines was one of the properties granted to the Abbey and remained in its possession until the Reformation. In 1086, the manor appears in the Middlesex section of Domesday Book as &quot;Stanes&quot;. In 1086, the manor had land for 24 ploughs, six mills and woodland for 30 pigs. It provided an annual income of £35 for the Abbey. Since it was relatively close to Westminster, Staines acted as a home farm, providing for the abbot&#x27;s personal household. 13th-century abbey records indicate that a market was taking place by 1218 and, in 1225, there were 46 burgesses living in the settlement, suggesting that Staines had become an important local centre.

Westminster Abbey was dissolved in 1540 and Staines then became a possession of the Crown, allowing Henry VIII to extend his Windsor hunting grounds further to the east. In 1613, James I granted the manor to Thomas Knyvet, who had arrested Guy Fawkes at the Palace of Westminster eight years earlier. Following Knyvet&#x27;s death, Staines passed to Sir Francis Leigh and, following the Restoration of the Monarchy, it was held briefly by Sir William Drake. The manor was then purchased by Richard Taylor, whose descendants lived at Knowle Green until the 19th century.

Reforms during the Tudor period reduced the importance of manorial courts and the day-to-day administration of towns such as Staines became the responsibility of the vestry of the parish church. The vestry appointed a constable, distributed funds to the poor and took charge of the repair of local roads. From the 17th century, the roles of Justices of the Peace were expanded to take greater responsibility for law and order in Staines.

The modern system of local government began to emerge during the 19th century. The Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 transferred responsibility for poor relief to the Poor Law Commission, whose local powers were delegated to the newly formed poor law union in 1836. In 1885 a local school board was established and three years later, the Local Government Act 1888 created the Middlesex County Council. An Urban District Council (UDC) and a Rural District Council (RDC) for the area were established in 1895 under the Local Government Act 1894, but the RDC was merged into the UDC in 1930.
Further reorganisation of the local authorities took place in the second half of the 20th century. Under the London Government Act 1963, Middlesex County Council was disbanded and the Staines UDC area was moved into Surrey. The Local Government Act 1972, which came into force on 1 April 1974, merged the Staines and Sunbury-on-Thames UDCs to form the Borough of Spelthorne.

===Staines Bridge===

The first surviving mention of a bridge from the medieval period is a document from 1222, that authorises repairs using wood cut from Windsor Forest. In around 1250, a causeway was constructed at Egham Hythe to improve the southern approach to the crossing. Also during the 13th century, there were renewals of the grant of pontage and, in 1376, tolls were levied on boat traffic to provide additional funds for maintenance. Local people left bequests for not only the repair of the bridge, but also the upkeep of the roads leading to it on each side of the river.

The bridge was destroyed in the Civil War and was not rebuilt until the 1680s. In 1734, an Act of Parliament noted that the structure was &quot;in a ruinous and dangerous condition&quot; and that the money raised from tolls and local taxes was insufficient to fund adequate maintenance. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, there were four attempts to construct a new bridge. The first, designed by Thomas Sandby, was opened in 1796, but was closed two years later after cracks started to form in the stonework. A cast-iron replacement, designed by James Wilson in consultation with George Rennie was opened in 1803, but cracked within two months. A third bridge was authorised by Act of Parliament in 1804. It was designed by Rennie and was constructed of timber, strengthened with cast iron plates. Although it did not suffer from the problems of the previous two bridges, it was costly to maintain (£11,000 in 1827) and restricted the width of boats passing beneath it.
A further Act of Parliament in 1828, authorised the borrowing of up to £60,000 for the construction of a fourth bridge. The granite structure was designed by George Rennie and was based on Waterloo Bridge. Rennie insisted that the site of the crossing be moved upstream, where deeper foundations could be constructed. The repositioning required new approach roads to be constructed and the necessary land was subject to compulsory purchase. The foundation stones were laid on each side of the river in September 1829 and William IV opened the bridge in April 1832. Tolls for crossing the bridge were abolished in 1871.

===Transport and communications===

The earliest locks on the upper Thames were built in the 17th century, following the establishment of the Oxford-Burcot Commission. However, efforts to improve the stretch of the river through Staines did not start until the 19th century. The pound lock at Penton Hook, a tight meander downstream of Staines, was constructed in 1815, but the weirs were not added until 1846. Bell Weir Lock, upstream of the town, opened in 1818, but was rebuilt in 1867-8 after the chamber walls had collapsed the previous year. The construction of the locks regulated the flow of the river and increased its depth to facilitate navigation, whilst maintaining an adequate head of water to power mills.

With the exception of the construction of the causeway at Egham Hythe in the mid-13th century, there were few improvements in the local road network in the millennium following the end of the Roman period. In 1727, the turnpike road from Hounslow to Bagshot, which crossed the river via Staines Bridge, was opened. A second turnpike, from Staines to Kingston opened in 1773. The re-siting of the bridge by George Rennie in the early 1830s necessitated changes in the road network at the western end of the High Street: The Market Square became a no through road and Clarence Street was constructed to direct traffic to the new crossing.

The railway line through Staines between Richmond and was opened by the Windsor, Staines and South Western Railway on 22 August 1848. In 1856, became a junction when the line across the Thames to Ascot was opened. A curve linking the Ascot and Datchet lines was opened in April 1877 and remained in use until March 1965. A second station in the town, Staines High Street station, to the northwest of the junction of this curve and the Datchet line, was open between 1884 and 1916. The railway line through Staines to Windsor was electrified in June 1930 and to in 1937. Staines signal box closed in September 1974.
A third station in the town was opened on 2 November 1885. was the terminus of a single-track branch from the Great Western Main Line, constructed by the Staines and West Drayton Railway Company. Originally the intention had been to create a junction with the line from Datchet and for trains to serve the main Staines station, but inter-company rivalry meant that a separate facility was built instead. The freight yard closed in the 1950s and passenger services ceased in March 1965. Trains continued to run to the Staines fuel yard, at Staines West, until the early 1990s.

During the second half of the 20th century, there were large-scale improvements to the road network around Staines. The A30 bypass was constructed in the early 1960s and included the building of Runnymede Bridge over the Thames. A second bridge, alongside the first, was required for the construction of the M25. The route of the motorway north of Staines was constrained by the Wraysbury Reservoir to the west and Staines Moor to the west. The Chertsey to Staines stretch of the M25 was opened in November 1981 with three lanes in each direction, but with a wide central reservation, allowing the road to be widened easily later. Four lanes in each direction were provided from outset between the A30 and the M4.
The Staines air disaster occurred on 18 June 1972, when a Hawker Siddeley Trident, operated by British European Airways, crashed shortly after takeoff from Heathrow Airport. All 118 people aboard the aircraft, including the six crew members, were killed. Two memorials to all the victims were dedicated on 18 June 2004 in Staines. The first is a stained-glass window in St Mary&#x27;s Church where an annual memorial service is held on 18 June. The second is a garden near the end of Waters Drive in the Moormede Estate, close to the accident site.

===Commerce and industry===
The first record of a market at Staines is from 1218, when the Sherriff of Middlesex was ordered to change the day on which it was held from Sunday to Friday. It had been discontinued by 1862, but re-established ten years later when the Town Hall was built. In 2022, the market is held in the High Street on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. An annual fair to be held in the settlement was granted to Westminster Abbey by Henry III in 1228. Initially it took place over four days at Ascensiontide, but the dates were changed to 7–10 September in 1241. By 1792, there were two one-day fairs each year, the first on 11 May for horses and cattle and the second on 19 September, known as the Onion Fair, for produce and trinkets. The fairs were abolished in 1896 by the Home Secretary at the request of the Staines UDC.
Domesday Book records six mills in Staines in 1086, one of which is thought to have been at Yeoveney on Staines Moor. The site, close to the Wraysbury River, an anabranch of the River Colne, is thought to have been the location of a late-medieval dye works and part of the mill was used for fulling in the 14th century. First recorded in 1682, Pound Mill was also on the Wraysbury River. It was bought by John Finch in 1747 and was a flour mill until the early 19th century, when it was used to grind mustard. The mill is immortalised in the road name, &quot;Mustard Mill Road&quot;.

Hale Mill, on the main channel of the Colne, is thought to have its origins in the 13th century, but it was rebuilt in 1388 and became a fulling mill in the 15th century. Many of the mills in the local area were purchased in the second half of the 18th century by Thomas Ashby, a miller originally from Maidenhead. Ashby founded a brewery, subsequently taken over by his sons, which became a major employer in the town. Brewing ceased in Staines in the 1950s, but bottling continued at the plant until the 1970s.
Staines became a centre for linoleum manufacture in 1864, when Frederick Walton, the inventor, opened the first factory to produce the floor covering on the Hale Mill site, to the north of the town centre. At its height in the 1920s, the Staines plant covered and was one of twenty producers in Great Britain. Following the end of the Second World War, there was a decline in lino sales as vinyl floor coverings became more popular. The Staines lino factory closed in 1973.

The Elmsleigh Shopping Centre was opened by Elizabeth II on 22 February 1980, providing of retail space. Much of the High Street was pedestrianised in 2002 and the Two Rivers Shopping Centre, on the site of the old linoleum works, was opened in 2002.

In the 21st century, proximity to London, Heathrow Airport and the M25 motorway has attracted large company branch offices, including: Bupa (healthcare) and Wood plc (oil &amp; gas). Siemens Building Automation Division and British Gas (part of Centrica) have their national headquarters here. Samsung R&amp;D Institute UK (SRUK), Samsung&#x27;s UK R&amp;D division, is based in the town.

===Residential development===
The modern settlement of Staines appears to have originated in the late 12th century, when the area around the High Street was developed as a planned town, possibly in response to rebuilding the bridge over the Thames. The medieval street plan was not altered until the re-siting of the bridge in the 1830s, at which point the urban area began to spread beyond the confines of the gravel islands.

The population of Staines grew from 1,750 in 1801 to 2,487 in 1841 and 4,638 in 1881. The increase in the second half of the 19th century was stimulated in part by the arrival of the railway in 1848. Cottages for artisans and semi-skilled workers began to spread along the London and Kingston Roads from the mid-19th century onwards. The residential roads to the south and southeast of the town centre were created in the early 1930s. Following the Second World War, there were new housing developments on Commercial Road and between Kingston Road and Elizabeth Avenue, primarily to provide accommodation for workers at the rapidly expanding Heathrow Airport.

===Staines in the Second World War===
Despite its proximity to London and the fact that Staines Bridge and the local factories presented obvious enemy targets, the town sustained relatively little bomb damage during the Second World War. There was a severe bombing raid on Staines on the night of 24–25 August 1940 and a V-1 flying bomb landed at the junction of Stanish Crescent and Kingston Road on 19 June 1944, killing four people and injuring a further 17. Within the Staines Urban District, a total 71 civilians died as result of enemy action. The Lagonda works at Egham Hythe were converted to the manufacture of munitions and the linoleum factory was dedicated to making military supplies.

Much of the civil defence effort was focused on the defence of Staines Bridge and tank traps were installed at each end. At the start of the war, a Bailey bridge was constructed across the Thames, in case the main bridge was damaged by bombing. The Bailey bridge remained in use for pedestrians until 1959, when it was dismantled.

==National and local government==
===UK parliament===
The town is in the parliamentary constituency of Spelthorne, and has been represented by Conservative Party MP Lincoln Jopp since 2024. From 2010 until the 2024 general election, Staines was represented at Westminster by Conservative Kwasi Kwarteng. Kwarteng was Chancellor of the Exchequer for 38 days during the 49 day premiership of Liz Truss.

===County council===
Councillors are elected to Surrey County Council every four years. The majority of the town is in the Staines electoral division, but areas to the southeast of the centre are in the Staines South and Ashford West electoral division.

===Borough council===
Staines is divided between three wards, each of which elects three councillors to Spelthorne Borough Council. The wards are Staines, Staines South, and Riverside and Laleham. The Borough of Spelthorne has been twinned with Melun, France since 1990 and with Grand Port, Mauritius since 2009.

==Demography and housing==


Across the South East Region, 28% of homes were detached houses and 22.6% were apartments.

==Public services==
===Utilities===
The first drinking water supply to Staines was provided by the West Surrey Water Company, whose works at Egham were built in 1889. Between 1960 and 1973, the company merged with its neighbours serving Woking and south west London, to form the North Surrey Water Company. Today, Affinity Water is responsible for supplying the town with drinking water.

Until the start of the 20th century, wastewater from Staines was discharged directly into the River Thames. Construction of the sewerage system began in 1899. The works closed in 1936, when the town sewers were connected to Mogden Sewage Works in Isleworth.

The Staines and Egham Gas Light and Coke Company was formed in 1834. It began to supply gas from its works in Bedfont Lane in Egham Hythe to the streetlamps on Staines Bridge in February of that year and the gas main to Staines was laid in 1835. At the start of the First World War, the Staines and Egham company was acquired by the Brentford Gas Company, which in 1949, following further mergers and acquisitions, became the North Thames Gas Company. A gasometer was constructed in Staines in 1927 and was demolished in 1986.

The first electricity generating station serving Staines opened in Egham High Street in 1905. It operated until 1912, when it was replaced by at new facility on The Causeway in Egham Hythe. The new works opened with an installed capacity of 188 kW and, by the time of its closure in 1924, it was capable of generating 688 kW.

===Emergency services and justice===
The earliest record of a permanent fire-fighting force in Staines is from 1738, when a hand-operated fire pump was purchased for the brigade. Reforms in 1774 transferred responsibility for fire services to the local authority and, in 1800, a new manual fire engine was purchased by the Staines force. The Staines UDC purchased the first diesel engine for the brigade in 1926, which was replaced by a Leyland terrier pump escape engine in 1935. Middlesex County Council took over responsibility for local fire services on 1 April 1948, building a new fire station at Stanwell and closing the Staines station in 1962. Surrey County Council became the fire authority for the local area in 1965.
The first surviving record of a town gaol in Staines is from 1274 and the erection of a new pillory and ducking stool is described in 1335. There were stocks in the Market Square through the 16th century until at least 1790. The vestry appointed the town Constable from the early 15th century until 1840, when responsibility for law enforcement was passed to the Metropolitan Police. In 1865, the police station moved to Kingston Road, later the site of the candle factory. The force relocated to a second station on Kingston Road in 1876 and moved again to new premises on the same street in 1998. In 2022, the local police force is Surrey Police.

The magistrates&#x27; courts at Knowle Green, opposite the Spelthorne Borough Council offices, were opened in 1976.

===Healthcare===
Staines Cottage Hospital was opened on 19 May 1914 on the corner of Kingston Road and Worple Road. It was renamed Staines Hospital in 1933, but its importance decreased following the opening of Ashford Hospital in 1939. During the 1960s, the men&#x27;s wards were shut and it became a hospital for female patients only. It closed in the early 1980s and the buildings were demolished in 1986. The Kingscroft respite service for adults with learning difficulties opened on the site in 1987.

The nearest hospital with an A&amp;E is St Peter&#x27;s Hospital, from Staines-upon-Thames. As of 2022, the town has GP practices at Burgess Way, Knowle Green and on Rochester Road.

==Transport==
===Bus===
Staines is linked by a number of bus routes to surrounding towns and villages in north Surrey, south west London (including Heathrow Airport) and east Berkshire. Operators serving the town include London United, First Berkshire &amp; The Thames Valley and White Bus Services. The bus station is to the south of the Elmsleigh Centre.

===Train===

Staines railway station is to the east of the town centre. It is managed by South Western Railway, which operates all services. Trains run to via , to via Ascot and to via .

===River navigation===
The non-tidal section of the River Thames is navigable between Lechlade in Gloucestershire and Teddington Lock. The navigation authority is the Environment Agency.

===Long-distance cycle route and footpath===
National Cycle Route 4, which links London to Fishguard, passes through Staines. The Thames Path crosses Staines Bridge.

==Education==
===Early schools===

The surviving first record of a schoolmaster in Staines is from 1353 and there are mentions of later postholders in documents dating from 1580 to 1673. However, by the 18th century, it appears that there was no dedicated teacher living in the town and, in 1795, the parish clerk was in receipt of a modest salary to teach four children. The British Boys&#x27; School in Staines was founded in 1808 and the girls&#x27; school was in existence by 1832. By 1852, the boys&#x27; school was in Hale Street and was educating around 35 pupils. An infants&#x27; school was founded in 1833, which moved with the girls school to Thames Street in 1867. The two schools moved again to larger premises in the same road, but the 1867 schoolhouse still survives behind the shop fronts. National Schools for boys and girls were established in 1818 and in the mid-1820s respectively, but both closed for around a decade before reopening in the mid-1840s. The girls&#x27; school moved to new premises in Bridge Street in 1850 and the boys&#x27; school relocated to London Road in 1863.

===Maintained schools===
Riverbridge Primary School was formed from the merger of three predecessor schools in September 2011. The oldest was Shortwood Infant School, which opened in 1905 as the Stanwell Road School. Knowle Park School opened in 1974, but had its origins in the Wyatt Road School which was formed in 1896. Kingscroft Junior School opened in 1992 and replaced Kingston Road School, which had opened in 1903. Riverbridge Primary School operated across three sites, until September 2014, when the former Shortwood Infant School premises were closed. The school became part of the Lumen Learning Trust in Autumn 2016.

Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Primary School was founded in 1893.

The construction of the Matthew Arnold School started in 1939, but work was suspended at the outbreak of the Second World War. However, parts of the building were sufficiently close to completion to allow pupils aged 11 to 14 from Kingston Road School to transfer to the site, after their classrooms were damaged by bombing. The school formally opened in 1954.

===Independent school===
Staines Preparatory School was founded by Cyril Travers Burges and opened on 8 May 1935. The original premises were at 1 Gresham Road, but the school moved to number 3 in 1938 and expanded to number 5 in 1951. The Burges Wing was constructed in 1991; the Jubilee Wing was built in 2002, and was extended in 2008. Today, Staines Prep School educates boys and girls between the ages of 3 and 11.

==Places of worship==
===St Mary&#x27;s Church===
St Mary&#x27;s Church is first recorded in 1179, but it is thought to have been in existence for at least 100 years before that. There is no mention of a church in Domesday Book, but there may have been a place of worship on the site since the 9th century. By the end of the medieval period, St Mary&#x27;s had a chancel, nave and an aisle on the north side. It was primarily built of brick in the Gothic style and the tower at the west end was added in 1631.

The condition of the church deteriorated in the late 17th and 18th century, due in part to the sale of the lead from the roof of the aisle to fund the Parliamentarian cause in the Civil War. The north side of the building collapsed in 1827 and a new church was built in 1828–9, incorporating the 17th-century tower. Among the stained glass panels in the church is a window behind the altar, given by the Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Prussia. In 2005, a window was dedicated to those who died in the 1972 Staines air disaster.

===St Peter&#x27;s Church===

St Peter&#x27;s Church was founded as a chapel of ease to St Mary&#x27;s in 1874. A brick building was constructed at the corner of Wyatt and Langley Roads and was used until 1885, when the congregation moved to an iron church on the corner of Edgell and Budebury Roads.

The foundation stone for the current St Peter&#x27;s Church was laid on 22 July 1893 and the building was consecrated on 28 July the following year. It was designed by George Fellowes Prynne in the free Perpendicular style and the cost of construction was paid by the Solicitor General, Edward Clarke MP. The crenellated tower is topped with a set-back spire, and contains a ring of eight bells.

===Christ Church===

The first Christ Church, in Kenilworth Gardens, was constructed in 1935 to serve the new area of housing along Kingston Road to the southeast of the town centre. The brick building was able to accommodate 280 worshippers, and a sliding partition at the west end of the chancel allowed the nave to be used as a church hall. The parish of Christ Church was created in 1951 and a decade later construction of a new church began on the same site as the old. The new Christ Church, consecrated in October 1962, has a centrally placed altar positioned beneath a square lantern. The lantern allows natural light into the interior of the building and is topped with a narrow spire. The font, which dates from 1750, was given to the congregation in 1935, and was previously installed in St Mary&#x27;s Church.

===Staines Methodist Church===
John Wesley made his first visit to Staines in 1771 and, by the early 19th century, there was a small congregation of Methodists in the town. The first chapel, opened on Kingston Road, was replaced by a larger building on the same street in 1865. The congregation moved to the current church, on Thames Street, in 1987.

===Our Lady of the Rosary===

The first Roman Catholic Mass to be celebrated at Staines since the Reformation, took place in 1862 at the workhouse, on the site of the present Ashford Hospital. A chapel was opened in 1890 on Gresham Road and was initially known as &quot;Our Lady, Help of Christians&quot;. The current name, &quot;Our Lady of the Rosary&quot; was granted in 1893. The building was extended eastwards to form the present church in 1931, with the addition of a chancel and narrow south aisle. Renovation work in 1990, added additional side aisles and created a new church hall at the west end.

===Staines Congregational Church===
There has been a substantial population of Dissenters living in Staines since the mid-17th century and, by 1690, there was a permanent meeting house in the town. The numbers of Congregationalists declined in the mid-18th century, but a regular meeting was re-established in the High Street in 1785. A chapel was constructed in Thames Street in 1802 and was replaced by a classical-style church on the same site in 1837. The present Congregational Church, on Kingston Road, opened in May 1956.

==Culture==
===Art===
Several artists have been inspired to paint Staines Bridge, including William Bernard Cooke (17781855) and Arthur Melville (18551904). An engraving of the bridge by William Woolnoth (17801837), inspired by a painting by John Preston Neale (17801847), is held by the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Among the works of public art on display are mosaics by Gary Drostle and sculptures by Terence Clarke that pay homage to the town&#x27;s history as a former Roman settlement. The Two Rivers shopping centre has two bronze sculptures by David Backhouse: The first, &quot;Time Continuum&quot;, celebrates the life of Staines through two millennia and the second, &quot;Water Sprites&quot;, references the life of the waterways that converge nearby. &quot;The Swanmaster&quot;, by Diana Thomson, commissioned by Spelthorne Borough Council in 1983, was moved to the Memorial Gardens in 2014.

===Film and television===
Staines is the hometown of the fictional Ali G, created by the actor and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. The character, who first appeared on &quot;The 11 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot; on Channel 4 in 1998, has been described as a &quot;disaffected wannabe homeboy of the suburbs&quot; by the television producer, Harry Thompson. Baron Cohen has said that Ali G &quot;believes that he is a black hip-hop artist from Staines. He believes his neighbourhood is a rough ghetto, when in fact it&#x27;s this lovely, leafy, middle-class suburb outside Windsor, where swans swim under the beautiful bridge.&quot; Following the successful spin-off television series &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot;, the character appeared in the 2002 feature film &quot;Ali G Indahouse&quot;. In the film, Ali G is a member of a fictional gang, the West Staines Massive, when his hometown is threatened by the expansion of Heathrow Airport. The film concludes with the saving of Staines and the decision to demolish Slough instead.

===Literature===
William Shakespeare mentions Staines in Act II Scene 3 of &quot;Henry V&quot;, when the Hostess asks her husband, who is travelling to Southampton, if she can accompany him as far as the town. Much of chapters 911 of &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; (1889) by Jerome K. Jerome is set in the Staines area, as the main characters travel upriver from Kingston-upon-Thames to Oxford. In Chapter 15 of H. G. Wells&#x27; novel &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1897), an artillery unit engages a Martian close to Staines. In John Wyndham&#x27;s novel &quot;The Kraken Wakes&quot; (1953), the main characters are stopped in their attempt to reach Cornwall on a dinghy through a flooded England in the &quot;Staines-Weybridge area&quot;.

===Music===
The indie rock band Hard-Fi was formed in Staines in 2003. Many of the songs from their first album, &quot;Stars of CCTV&quot;, describe their small-town suburban origins. In 2011, lead singer Richard Archer attracted criticism after describing Staines as a &quot;ghost town&quot;.

==Sport==
===Leisure Centre===
Spelthorne Leisure Centre, at Knowle Green, opened in 1990 on the site of the former indoor swimming pool which was constructed in 1967. A new leisure centre, which will provide a 25 m pool, a fitness suite and three artificial football pitches on its roof, is expected to open in 2024.

===Association football===
Staines Town F.C. (STFC) traces its origins to a football team from St Peter&#x27;s Institute, which took part in the 1878–79 FA Cup. STFC itself was founded in 1892 and initially played its home games at Hammond&#x27;s Farm, now beneath the King George VI reservoir. It later merged with the St Peter&#x27;s team, but the combined club closed in 1935. STFC was reformed towards the end of the Second World War and played its home games at Wheatsheaf Park. The ground was refurbished in 2004, but in March 2022 the club announced that it was in dispute with its landlord and would be suspending football operations with immediate effect.

Staines Lammas F.C. was founded in 1926 and initially played its home games at the Lammas Recreation Ground. The club moved to Laleham Recreation Ground in the 1980s and, in 2001, opened a new pavilion.

===Cricket===
Cricket has been played on Staines Moor since at least 1759 and the nearby Laleham Burway was the site of the first recorded 11-a-side match in Surrey in 1778. Laleham Cricket Club was founded over 200 years ago. It changed its name to the Staines and Laleham Cricket Club in the early 1970s, when it moved from Ashford Road to its current ground, &quot;The Faulkners&quot;, on Worple Road.

===Hockey===
Staines Hockey Club was formed in 1890 and is one of the oldest hockey clubs in the world. During its early years, the club had several international players among its members, who won gold medals at the 1908 Olympic Games. The club has been based at Worple Road since 1972 and the ground has four full-size hockey pitches. The first ladies&#x27; team was formed in 1979 and the first artificial turf pitch was laid in 2001.

===Rugby===
Staines Rugby Football Club was founded in summer 1926 and played its first game against a team from Windsor at the Lammas Recreation Ground that October. In 1947, the club began to rent pitches at the Laleham Cricket Club ground in Ashford Road. It acquired the land for its current premises, a former gravel pit in Hanworth, in 1962. The ground, known as &quot;The Reeves&quot;, opened in September 1964.

===Rowing===
Staines Boat Club was formed in 1851 and, in 1909, was one of the founder members of the Remenham Club. The current boathouse, at Egham Hythe, is a temporary structure, built in 1950 after the previous building was destroyed by fire.

===Staines Stadium===

Staines Stadium, on Wraysbury Road, was opened in 1928 and was primarily used for greyhound racing. In 1936, a dozen Cheetahs were imported from Kenya and, having served a six-month quarantine, were trained to follow the mechanical hare and to race with the dogs. Stock car racing took place at the venue in the late 1950s. The stadium closed in 1960, when the A30 Staines bypass was constructed through part of the site, and was demolished in 1965.

==Notable buildings and landmarks==
===Blue Anchor===

There is thought to have been an inn on the site of the Blue Anchor since the 16th century. The present building dates from the early- to mid-18th century and is constructed in brick. Much of the interior is thought to be original, including the wooden panelling, several fireplaces and at least one of the staircases. Within a few decades of completion, five of the upstairs windows had been bricked up to reduce window tax liability. During renovation work in 1957, one of the oak beams in the building was dated using dendrochronology and was found to be 650 years old.

===Coal Tax posts===
There are three surviving coal-tax posts in the Staines area. These posts marked the limits of the tax jurisdiction of the Corporation of the City of London and were erected under the provisions of the London Coal and Wine Duties Continuance Act 1861. The two posts currently on Wraysbury Road were relocated to their present positions in the second half of the 20th century. The third, a cast-iron obelisk, is in Thames Street close to the Thames Lodge Hotel.

===London Stone===
The London Stone is a carved stone pillar, positioned beside the River Thames next to the Lammas Recreation Ground. The first stone was erected by the Corporation of the City of London in 1280 or 1285, following its purchase of the river rights from Richard I. Originally positioned close to the Market Square, it marked the western boundary of the corporation&#x27;s jurisdiction and is thought to have indicated the tidal limit of the Thames in medieval times. It was moved to its current position in the 17th or 18th century and was replaced by a replica in 1986. The original stone is now held by the Spelthorne Museum at Staines Library.

===Reservoirs===
The twin Staines Reservoirs, to the northeast of the town, were completed in 1902 and have a combined capacity of . They are filled from the Staines Reservoirs Aqueduct, which runs from the Thames at Bell Weir Lock, Hythe End. The two reservoirs are separated by a embankment and, under normal operating conditions, the water level of the northern reservoir is higher than that of the south. During the Second World War, Staines Reservoirs were used by No. 617 Squadron RAF to practise aiming bouncing bombs in preparation for Operation Chastise.

The King George VI Reservoir was completed in 1939, but was left unfilled for the duration of the Second World War. In 1942, it was used by the Royal Air Force for Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation experiments. It was finally opened by King George VI in November 1947 and holds .

===Town Hall===

The Town Hall, in the Market Square, was designed by John Johnson in the Renaissance style and was completed in 1880. It replaced a medieval market hall, which was closed in 1862. The building is constructed in white brick with stone dressing with a fish-scale slate roof and the clock was manufactured by Gillett &amp; Bland.

The Town Hall was used as the council headquarters until 1976, when Spelthorne Borough council relocated to Knowle Green. In the early 1990s, it was used as an arts centre and, in 2004, it became a wine bar. In January 2018, the building was converted into thirteen residential apartments.

===War memorial===

Staines War Memorial was designed by E. J. Barrett and was installed in the Memorial Gardens in 1920. It takes the form of a statue of the winged figure of Victory and is constructed in Portland stone. The names of 196 men who died in the First World War are inscribed on the plinth, beneath which is an inclined stone tablet listing those who died in the Second World War. The memorial was moved to the Market Square in 2002.

==Parks and open spaces==
===Church Lammas===

The Church Lammas is an area of common land to the northeast of the town centre, adjacent to the Lammas Recreation Ground. Between 1988 and 1996, it was the site of a quarry and, after gravel and sand extraction had ceased, the area was landscaped to create a recreational area with three lakes. In 2005, the former quarry operator was awarded the Cooper-Heyman Cup in recognition of its work to ensure that the park is fully accessible to disabled visitors.

===Lammas Recreation Ground===
The Lammas lands were granted to the town by John Ashby in 1922. The area opened to the public as a recreation ground in September of the same year. Since it had previously been common land, residents received compensation for the removal of their grazing rights.

===Market Square and Memorial Gardens===

The Memorial Gardens, alongside the River Thames, were first opened in 1897 as the &quot;Town Gardens&quot;. They acquired their current name after the First World War when the town war memorial was erected beside the river. In 2002, the Market Square was refurbished and new gateways, known as the &quot;Swan Arches&quot;, were installed at the main access points to the Memorial Gardens.

===Staines Moor===

The Staines Moor, north of the town and east of the M25 motorway, is the largest area of common land in Staines. Until the Commons Registration Act 1965 came into force, any homeowner, whose chimney smoke could be seen from St Mary&#x27;s Church, was entitled to graze their animals on the moor between April and December each year.

Staines Moor is the largest area of alluvial meadow in Surrey and was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1984. Several rare plants are found on the moor such as brown sedge, small water pepper and upright chickweed. The area also provides a habitat for invertebrates including bees, butterflies and moths. Some 217 species of mollusc and 190 species of bird have also been recorded.

===Staines Park===
Staines Park at Knowle Green, to the east of the town centre, is a recreation ground with tennis courts, a bowling green and a children&#x27;s playground. Since 2019, the park has been legally protected by the charity, Fields in Trust.
