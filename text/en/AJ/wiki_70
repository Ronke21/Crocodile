<text>Muhammad Anwar es-Sadat (25 December 1918 – 6 October 1981) was an Egyptian politician and military officer who served as the third president of Egypt, from 15 October 1970 until his assassination by fundamentalist army officers on 6 October 1981. Sadat was a senior member of the Free Officers who overthrew King Farouk I in the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, and a close confidant of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, under whom he served as vice president twice and whom he succeeded as president in 1970. In 1978, Sadat and Menachem Begin, Prime Minister of Israel, signed a peace treaty in cooperation with United States President Jimmy Carter, for which they were recognized with the Nobel Peace Prize.

In his 11 years as president, he changed Egypt&#x27;s trajectory, departing from many political and economic tenets of Nasserism, reinstituting a multi-party system, and launching the Infitah economic policy. As President, he led Egypt in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 to regain Egypt&#x27;s Sinai Peninsula, which Israel had occupied since the Six-Day War of 1967, making him a hero in Egypt and, for a time, the wider Arab World. Afterwards, he engaged in negotiations with Israel, culminating in the Camp David Accords and the Egypt–Israel peace treaty; this won him and Menachem Begin the Nobel Peace Prize, making Sadat the first Muslim Nobel laureate. 

Although reaction to the treatywhich resulted in the return of Sinai to Egyptwas generally favorable among Egyptians, it was rejected by the country&#x27;s Muslim Brotherhood and the left, which felt Sadat had abandoned efforts to ensure a State of Palestine. With the exception of Sudan, the Arab world and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) strongly opposed Sadat&#x27;s efforts to make a separate peace with Israel without prior consultations with the Arab states. His refusal to reconcile with them over the Palestinian issue resulted in Egypt being suspended from the Arab League from 1979 to 1989. The peace treaty was also one of the primary factors that led to his assassination; on 6 October 1981, militants led by Khalid Islambouli opened fire on Sadat with automatic rifles during the 6 October parade in Cairo, killing him.

==Early life and revolutionary activities==

Anwar Sadat was born on 25 December 1918 in Mit Abu El Kom, part of Monufia Governorate in what was then the Sultanate of Egypt, to a poor family, and he had 14 siblings. One of his brothers, Atef Sadat, later became a pilot and was killed in action in 1973 during the Yom Kippur War. His father, Anwar Mohammed El Sadat, was an Upper Egyptian, and his mother, Sit Al-Berain, was born to an Egyptian mother and a Sudanese father.

He graduated from the Royal Military Academy in Cairo, the capital of what was then the Kingdom of Egypt, in 1938 and was appointed to the Signal Corps. He entered the army as a second lieutenant and was posted to the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (the Sudan being a condominium under joint British and Egyptian rule at the time). There, he met Gamal Abdel Nasser, and along with several other junior officers they formed the Free Officers, an organization committed to overthrowing British rule in Egypt and eliminating state corruption.

During World War II, Sadat, a member of the fascist and ultranationalist Young Egypt Party, collaborated with spies of Nazi Germany in Egypt as part of Operation Salam. Once this was discovered by the British, he was arrested and imprisoned for much of the war. By the end of the conflict, he had already met with the secret society that decided to assassinate Amin Osman, Minister of Finance in the Wafd Party government, and the head of the Egyptian-British Friendship Society, due to his strong sympathies towards the British. Osman was assassinated in January 1946. Following the assassination of Amin Osman, Sadat returned again and finally to prison. 

In Qarmidan prison, he faced the most difficult ordeals of imprisonment by being held in solitary confinement, but the first accused in the Hussein Tawfiq case, escaped, and after there is no criminality evidence all the charges fall and the suspected went free. Salah Zulfikar, then young police officer, at that time was the officer in charge in the prison. He believed in his heart of Sadat&#x27;s heroism and that he played a patriotic role towards his country and that he was convicted and imprisoned because of his love for his country. Zulfikar brought with him food, newspapers and cigarettes and helped his family a lot in obtaining visitor permits to check on him. Anwar Sadat was active in many political movements, including the Muslim Brotherhood, the fascist Young Egypt Party, the pro-Axis and pro-Royalist Iron Guard of Egypt, and the secret military group called the Free Officers. Along with his fellow Free Officers, Sadat participated in the military coup that launched the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, which overthrew King Farouk I on 23 July of that year. Sadat gave the first statement of the revolution over the radio to the Egyptian people.

==During Nasser&#x27;s presidency==
During the presidency of Gamal Abdel Nasser, Sadat was appointed minister of State in 1954. He was also appointed editor of the newly founded daily &quot;Al Gomhuria&quot;. In 1959, he assumed the position of secretary to the National Union. Sadat was the president of the National Assembly (1960–1968) and then Vice President of Egypt and member of the presidential council in 1964. He was reappointed as vice president again in December 1969.

==Presidency==


Some of the major events of Sadat&#x27;s presidency were his &quot;Corrective Revolution&quot; to consolidate power, the break with Egypt&#x27;s long-time ally and aid-giver the USSR, the 1973 October War with Israel, the Camp David Accords and the Egypt–Israel peace treaty, the &quot;opening up&quot; (or Infitah) of Egypt&#x27;s economy, and lastly his assassination in 1981.

Sadat succeeded Nasser as president after the latter&#x27;s death in October 1970. Sadat&#x27;s presidency was widely expected to be short-lived. Viewing him as having been little more than a puppet of the former president, Nasser&#x27;s supporters in government settled on Sadat as someone they could manipulate easily. Sadat surprised everyone with a series of astute political moves by which he was able to retain the presidency and emerge as a leader in his own right. 

On 15 May 1971, Sadat announced his &quot;Corrective Revolution&quot;, purging the government, political and security establishments of the most ardent Nasserists. Sadat encouraged the emergence of an Islamist movement, which had been suppressed by Nasser. Believing Islamists to be socially conservative he gave them &quot;considerable cultural and ideological autonomy&quot; in exchange for political support.

In 1971, as part of the Jarring Mission, three years into the War of Attrition in the Suez Canal zone, Sadat endorsed in a letter the peace proposals of UN negotiator Gunnar Jarring, which seemed to lead to a full peace with Israel on the basis of Israel&#x27;s withdrawal to its pre-war borders. This peace initiative failed as neither Israel nor the United States of America accepted the terms as discussed then.

===Corrective Revolution===

Shortly after taking office, Sadat shocked many Egyptians by dismissing and imprisoning two of the most powerful figures in the regime, Vice President Ali Sabri, who had close ties with Soviet officials, and Sharawi Gomaa, the Interior Minister, who controlled the secret police. 

Sadat&#x27;s rising popularity would accelerate after he cut back the powers of the hated secret police, expelled Soviet military from the country and reformed the Egyptian army for a renewed confrontation with Israel.

===Yom Kippur War===

On 6 October 1973, in conjunction with Hafez al-Assad of Syria, Sadat launched the October War, also known as the Yom Kippur War (and less commonly as the Ramadan War), a surprise attack against the Israeli forces occupying the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula, and the Syrian Golan Heights in an attempt to retake these respective Egyptian and Syrian territories that had been occupied by Israel since the Six Day War six years earlier. The Egyptian and Syrian performance in the initial stages of the war astonished both Israel, and the Arab World. The most striking achievement (Operation Badr, also known as The Crossing) was the Egyptian military&#x27;s advance approximately 15 km into the occupied Sinai Peninsula after penetrating and largely destroying the Bar Lev Line. This line was popularly thought to have been an impregnable defensive chain.

As the war progressed, three divisions of the Israeli army led by General Ariel Sharon had crossed the Suez Canal, trying to encircle first the Egyptian Second Army. Although this failed, prompted by an agreement between the United States of America and the Soviet Union, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 338 on 22 October 1973, calling for an immediate ceasefire. Although agreed upon, the ceasefire was immediately broken. Alexei Kosygin, the chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, cancelled an official meeting with Danish Prime Minister Anker Jørgensen to travel to Egypt where he tried to persuade Sadat to sign a peace treaty. During Kosygin&#x27;s two-day long stay it is unknown if he and Sadat ever met in person.

The Israeli military then continued their drive to encircle the Egyptian army. The encirclement was completed on 24 October, three days after the ceasefire was broken. This development prompted superpower tension, but a second ceasefire was imposed cooperatively on 25 October to end the war. At the conclusion of hostilities, Israeli forces were 40 kilometres (25 mi) from Damascus and 101 kilometres (63 mi) from Cairo.

===Peace with Israel===

The initial Egyptian and Syrian victories in the war restored popular morale throughout Egypt and the Arab World and, for many years after, Sadat was known as the &quot;Hero of the Crossing&quot;. Israel recognized Egypt as a formidable foe, and Egypt&#x27;s renewed political significance eventually led to regaining and reopening the Suez Canal through the peace process. His new peace policy led to the conclusion of two agreements on disengagement of forces with the Israeli government. The first of these agreements was signed on 18 January 1974, and the second on 4 September 1975.

One major aspect of Sadat&#x27;s peace policy was to gain some religious support for his efforts. Already during his visit to the US in October–November 1975, he invited Evangelical pastor Billy Graham for an official visit, which was held a few days after Sadat&#x27;s visit. In addition to cultivating relations with Evangelical Christians in the US, he also built some cooperation with the Vatican. On 8 April 1976, he visited the Vatican for the first time, and got a message of support from Pope Paul VI regarding achieving peace with Israel, to include a just solution to the Palestinian issue. Sadat, on his part, extended to the Pope a public invitation to visit Cairo.

Sadat also used the media to promote his purposes. In an interview he gave to the Lebanese magazine &quot;Al Hawadeth&quot; in early February 1976, he claimed he had secret commitment from the US government to put pressure on the Israeli government for a major withdrawal in Sinai and the Golan Heights. This statement caused some concern to the Israeli government, but Secretary of State Henry Kissinger denied such a promise was ever made.

In January 1977, a series of &#x27;Bread Riots&#x27; protested Sadat&#x27;s economic liberalization and specifically a government decree lifting price controls on basic necessities like bread. The riots lasted for two days and included hundreds of thousands in Cairo. 120 buses and hundreds of buildings were destroyed in Cairo alone. The riots ended with the deployment of the army and the re-institution of the subsidies/price controls. During this time, Sadat was also taking a new approach towards improving relations with the West.

The United States and the Soviet Union agreed on 1 October 1977, on principles to govern a Geneva conference on the Middle East. Syria continued to resist such a conference. Not wanting either Syria or the Soviet Union to influence the peace process, Sadat decided to take more progressive stance towards building a comprehensive peace agreement with Israel.

The 1977 visit by Anwar Sadat to Israel was the first time an Arab leader officially visited Israel. Sadat met with Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin, and spoke before the Knesset in Jerusalem about his views on how to achieve a comprehensive peace to the Arab–Israeli conflict, which included the full implementation of UN Resolutions 242 and 338.

The Peace treaty was finally signed by Anwar Sadat and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin in Washington, D.C., United States, on 26 March 1979, following the Camp David Accords, a series of meetings between Egypt and Israel facilitated by US president Jimmy Carter. Both Sadat and Begin were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for creating the treaty. In his acceptance speech, Sadat referred to the long-awaited peace desired by both Arabs and Israelis.

The main features of the agreement were the mutual recognition of each country by the other, the cessation of the state of war that had existed since the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and the complete withdrawal by Israel of its armed forces and civilians from the rest of the Sinai Peninsula, which Israel had captured during the 1967 Six-Day War.

The agreement also provided for the free passage of Israeli ships through the Suez Canal and recognition of the Strait of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba as international waterways. The agreement notably made Egypt the first Arab country to officially recognize Israel. The peace agreement between Egypt and Israel has remained in effect since the treaty was signed.

The treaty was extremely unpopular in most of the Arab World and the wider Muslim World. His predecessor Nasser had made Egypt an icon of Arab nationalism, an ideology that appeared to be sidelined by an Egyptian orientation following the 1973 war (see National identity of Egyptians). The neighboring Arab countries believed that in signing the accords, Sadat had put Egypt&#x27;s interests ahead of Arab unity, betraying Nasser&#x27;s pan-Arabism, and destroyed the vision of a united &quot;Arab front&quot; for the support of the Palestinians against the &quot;Zionist Entity&quot;. However, Sadat decided early on that peace was the solution. Sadat&#x27;s shift towards a strategic relationship with the US was also seen as a betrayal by many Arabs. In the United States his peace moves gained him popularity among some Evangelical circles. He was awarded the Prince of Peace Award by Pat Robertson.

In 1979, the Arab League suspended Egypt in the wake of the Egyptian–Israel peace agreement, and the League moved its headquarters from Cairo to Tunis. Arab League member states believed in the elimination of the &quot;Zionist Entity&quot; and Israel at that time. It was not until 1989 that the League re-admitted Egypt as a member, and returned its headquarters to Cairo. As part of the peace deal, Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula in phases, completing its withdrawal from the entire territory except the town of Taba by 25 April 1982 (withdrawal from which did not occur until 1989). The improved relations Egypt gained with the West through the Camp David Accords soon gave the country resilient economic growth. By 1980, however, Egypt&#x27;s strained relations with the Arab World would result in a period of rapid inflation.

===Relationship with Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi of Iran===

The relationship between Iran and Egypt had fallen into open hostility during Gamal Abdel Nasser&#x27;s presidency. Following his death in 1970, President Sadat turned this around quickly into an open and close friendship.

In 1971, Sadat addressed the Iranian parliament in Tehran in fluent Persian, describing the 2,500-year-old historic connection between the two lands.

Overnight, the Egyptian and Iranian governments were turned from bitter enemies into fast friends. The relationship between Cairo and Tehran became so friendly that the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, called Sadat his &quot;dear brother&quot;.

After the 1973 war with Israel, Iran assumed a leading role in cleaning up and reactivating the blocked Suez Canal with heavy investment. The country also facilitated the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Sinai Peninsula by promising to substitute the loss of the oil to the Israelis with free Iranian oil if they withdrew from the Egyptian oil wells in western Sinai.

All these added more to the personal friendship between Sadat and the Shah of Iran. (The Shah&#x27;s first wife was Princess Fawzia of Egypt. She was the eldest daughter of Sultan Fuad I of Egypt and Sudan (later King Fuad I) and his second wife Nazli Sabri.)

After his overthrow, the deposed Shah spent the last months of his life in exile in Egypt. When the Shah died, Sadat ordered that he be given a state funeral and be interred at the Al-Rifa&#x27;i Mosque in Cairo, the resting place of Egyptian Khedive Isma&#x27;il Pasha, his mother Khushyar Hanim, and numerous other members of the royal family of Egypt and Sudan.

==Assassination==

The last months of Sadat&#x27;s presidency were marked by internal uprising. Sadat dismissed allegations that the rioting was incited by domestic issues, believing that the Soviet Union was recruiting its regional allies in Libya and Syria to incite an uprising that would eventually force him out of power. Following a failed military coup in June 1981, Sadat ordered a major crackdown that resulted in the arrest of numerous opposition figures. Although Sadat still maintained high levels of popularity in Egypt, it has been said that he was assassinated &quot;at the peak&quot; of his unpopularity.

Earlier in his presidency, Islamists had benefited from the &#x27;rectification revolution&#x27; and the release from prison of activists jailed under Nasser. But Sadat&#x27;s Sinai treaty with Israel enraged Islamists, particularly the radical Egyptian Islamic Jihad. According to interviews and information gathered by journalist Lawrence Wright, the group was recruiting military officers and accumulating weapons, waiting for the right moment to launch &quot;a complete overthrow of the existing order&quot; in Egypt. Chief strategist of El-Jihad was Abbud al-Zumar, a colonel in the military intelligence whose &quot;plan was to kill the main leaders of the country, capture the headquarters of the army and State Security, the telephone exchange building, and of course the radio and television building, where news of the Islamic revolution would then be broadcast, unleashinghe expecteda popular uprising against secular authority all over the country&quot;.

In February 1981, Egyptian authorities were alerted to El-Jihad&#x27;s plan by the arrest of an operative carrying crucial information. In September, Sadat ordered a highly unpopular roundup of more than 1,500 people, including many Jihad members, but also the Coptic Pope and other Coptic clergy, intellectuals and activists of all ideological stripes. All non-government press was banned as well. The roundup missed a Jihad cell in the military led by Lieutenant Khalid Islambouli, who would succeed in assassinating Anwar Sadat that October.

According to Tala&#x27;at Qasim, ex-head of the Gama&#x27;a Islamiyya interviewed in &quot;Middle East Report&quot;, it was not Islamic Jihad but his organization, known in English as the &quot;Islamic Group&quot;, that organized the assassination and recruited the assassin (Islambouli). Members of the Group&#x27;s &#x27;Majlis el-Shura&#x27; (&#x27;Consultative Council&#x27;) – headed by the famed &#x27;blind shaykh&#x27; – were arrested two weeks before the killing, but they did not disclose the existing plans and Islambouli succeeded in assassinating Sadat.

On 6 October 1981, Sadat was assassinated during the annual victory parade held in Cairo to celebrate Egypt&#x27;s crossing of the Suez Canal. Islambouli emptied his assault rifle into Sadat&#x27;s body while in the front of the grandstand, mortally wounding the President. In addition to Sadat, eleven others were killed, including the Cuban ambassador, an Omani general, a Coptic Orthodox bishop and Samir Helmy, the head of Egypt&#x27;s Central Auditing Agency (CAA). Twenty-eight were wounded, including Vice President Hosni Mubarak, Irish Defence Minister James Tully, and four US military liaison officers.

The assassination squad was led by Lieutenant Khalid Islambouli after a fatwā approving the assassination had been obtained from Omar Abdel-Rahman. Islambouli was tried, found guilty, sentenced to death, and executed by firing squad in April 1982.

==Aftermath==
Sadat was succeeded by his vice president Hosni Mubarak, whose hand was injured during the attack. Sadat&#x27;s funeral was attended by a record number of dignitaries from around the world, including a rare simultaneous attendance by three former US presidents: Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon. Sudan&#x27;s President Gaafar Nimeiry was the only Arab head of state to attend the funeral. Only 3 of 24 states in the Arab LeagueOman, Somalia and Sudansent representatives at all. Israel&#x27;s prime minister, Menachem Begin, considered Sadat a personal friend and insisted on attending the funeral, walking throughout the funeral procession so as not to desecrate the Sabbath. Sadat was buried in the unknown soldier memorial in Cairo, across the street from the stand where he was assassinated.

Over three hundred Islamic radicals were indicted in the trial of assassin Khalid Islambouli, including future al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, Omar Abdel-Rahman, and Abd al-Hamid Kishk. The trial was covered by the international press and Zawahiri&#x27;s knowledge of English made him the de facto spokesman for the defendants. Zawahiri was released from prison in 1984. Abboud al-Zomor and Tareq al-Zomor, two Islamic Jihad leaders imprisoned in connection with the assassination, were released on 11 March 2011.

Despite these facts, the nephew of the late president, Talaat Sadat, claimed that the assassination was an international conspiracy. On 31 October 2006, he was sentenced to a year in prison for defaming Egypt&#x27;s armed forces, less than a month after he gave the interview accusing Egyptian generals of masterminding his uncle&#x27;s assassination. In an interview with a Saudi television channel, he also claimed both the United States and Israel were involved noting that no one from the special personal protection group of Sadat fired a single shot during the killing, and not one of them has been put on trial.

==Media portrayals of Anwar Sadat==

In 1983, &quot;Sadat&quot;, a miniseries based on the life of Anwar Sadat, aired on US television with Oscar-winning actor Louis Gossett Jr. in the title role. The film was promptly banned by the Egyptian government, as were all other movies produced and distributed by Columbia Pictures, over allegations of historical inaccuracies. A civil lawsuit was brought by Egypt&#x27;s artists&#x27; and film unions against Columbia Pictures and the film&#x27;s directors, producers and scriptwriters before a court in Cairo, but was dismissed, since the alleged slanders, having taken place outside the country, fell outside the Egyptian courts&#x27; jurisdiction.

The film was critically acclaimed in North America, but was unpopular among Egyptians and in the Egyptian press. Western authors attributed the film&#x27;s poor reception in Egypt to racism – Gossett being African-American – in the Egyptian government or Egypt in general. Either way, one Western source wrote that Sadat&#x27;s portrayal by Gossett &quot;bothered race-conscious Egyptians and wouldn&#x27;t have pleased [the deceased] Sadat,&quot; who identified as Egyptian and Northeast African, not black. The two-part series earned Gossett an Emmy nomination in the United States.

He was portrayed by Robert Loggia in the 1982 television movie &quot;A Woman Called Golda&quot;, opposite Ingrid Bergman as Golda Meir.

The first Egyptian depiction of Sadat&#x27;s life came in 2001, when &quot;Ayyam El Sadat&quot; (English: &quot;The Days of Sadat&quot;) was released in Egyptian cinemas. The movie was a major success in Egypt, and was hailed as Ahmed Zaki&#x27;s greatest performance to date.

Sadat was a recurring character on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, played by Garrett Morris, who bore a resemblance to Sadat.

<text>Bayreuth ( or ; Upper Franconian: Bareid, ) is a town in northern Bavaria, Germany, on the Red Main river in a valley between the Franconian Jura and the Fichtel Mountains. The town&#x27;s roots date back to 1194. In the 21st century, it is the capital of Upper Franconia and has a population of 72,148 (2015). It hosts the annual Bayreuth Festival, at which performances of operas by the 19th-century German composer Richard Wagner are presented.

==History==

===Middle Ages and Early Modern Period===

The town is believed to have been founded by the counts of Andechs probably around the mid-12th century, but was first mentioned in 1194 as &quot;Baierrute&quot; in a document by Bishop Otto II of Bamberg. The syllable &quot;-rute&quot; may mean &quot;Rodung&quot; or &quot;clearing&quot;, whilst &quot;Baier-&quot; indicates immigrants from the Bavarian region.

Already documented earlier, were villages later merged into Bayreuth: Seulbitz (in 1035 as the royal Salian estate of Silewize in a document by Emperor Conrad II) and St. Johannis (possibly 1149 as &quot;Altentrebgast&quot;). Even the district of Altstadt (formerly Altenstadt) west of the town centre must be older than the town of Bayreuth itself. Even older traces of human presence were found in the hamlets of Meyernberg: pieces of pottery and wooden crockery were dated to the 9th century based on their decoration.

While Bayreuth was previously (1199) referred to as a &quot;villa&quot; (&quot;village&quot;), the term &quot;civitas&quot; (&quot;town&quot;) appeared for the first time in a document published in 1231. One can therefore assume that Bayreuth was awarded its town charter between 1200 and 1230. The town was ruled until 1248 by the counts of Andechs-Merania. After they died out in 1260 the burgraves of Nuremberg from the House of Hohenzollern took over the inheritance.

As early as 1361 Emperor Charles IV conferred on Burgrave Frederick V the right to mint coins for the towns of Bayreuth and Kulmbach.

In 1398 Bayreuth was partitioned from Nuremberg, becoming the Principality of Bayreuth (). Until 1604, however, the princely residence and the centre of the territory was the castle of Plassenburg in Kulmbach and as such the territory was officially known as the Principality of Kulmbach. The town of Bayreuth developed slowly and was affected time and again by disasters.

Bayreuth was first published on a map in 1421.

In February 1430, the Hussites devastated Bayreuth and the town hall and churches were razed. Matthäus Merian described this event in 1642 as follows: &quot;In 1430 the Hussites from Bohemia attacked / Culmbach and Barreut / and committed great acts of cruelty / like wild animals / against the common people / and certain individuals. / The priests / monks and nuns they either burnt at the stake / or took them onto the ice of lakes and rivers / (in Franconia and Bavaria) and doused them with cold water / and killed them in a deplorable way / as Boreck reported in the Bohemian Chronicle, page 450&quot;.

By 1528, less than ten years after the start of the Reformation, the lords of the Frankish margrave territories switched to the Lutheran faith.

In 1605 a great fire, caused by negligence, destroyed 137 of the town&#x27;s 251 houses. In 1620 plague broke out and, in 1621, there was another big fire in the town. The town also suffered during the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

A turning point in the town&#x27;s history came in 1603 when Margrave Christian, the son of the elector, John George of Brandenburg, moved the aristocratic residence from the castle of Plassenburg above Kulmbach to Bayreuth. The first Hohenzollern palace was built in 1440–1457 under Margrave John the Alchemist. It was the forerunner of today&#x27;s Old Palace (&quot;Altes Schloss&quot;) and was expanded and renovated many times. The development of the new capital stagnated due to the Thirty Years&#x27; War, but afterwards many baroque buildings were added to the town. After Christian&#x27;s death in 1655 his grandson, Christian Ernest, followed him, ruling from 1661 until 1712. He was an educated and well-travelled man, whose tutor had been the statesman Joachim Friedrich von Blumenthal. He founded the Christian-Ernestinum Grammar School and, in 1683, participated in the liberation of Vienna which had been besieged by the Turks. To commemorate this feat, he had the Margrave Fountain built as a monument on which he is depicted as the victor of the Turks; it now stands outside the New Palace (&quot;Neues Schloss&quot;). During this time, the outer ring of the town wall and the castle chapel (&quot;Schlosskirche&quot;) were built.

===18th century===


Christian Ernest&#x27;s successor, the Crown Prince and later Margrave, George William, began in 1701 to establish the then independent town of St Georgen am See (today, the district of St Georgen) with its castle, the so-called &quot;Ordensschloss&quot;, a town hall, a prison and a small barracks. In 1705 he founded the Order of Sincerity (Ordre de la Sincérité), which was renamed in 1734 to the Order of the Red Eagle and had the monastery church built, which was completed in 1711. In 1716 a princely porcelain factory was established in St. Georgen.

The first &#x27;castle&#x27; in the park of the Hermitage was built at this time by Margrave George William (1715–1719).

In 1721, the town council acquired the palace of Baroness Sponheim (today&#x27;s Old Town Hall or &quot;Altes Rathaus&quot;) as a replacement for the town hall built in 1440 in the middle of the market place and destroyed by fire.

In 1735, a nursing home, the so-called Gravenreuth Stift, was founded by a private foundation in St. Georgen. The cost of the building exceeded the funds of the foundation, but Margrave Frederick came to their aid.

Bayreuth experienced its Golden Age during the reign (1735–1763) of Margrave Frederick and Margravine Wilhelmina of Bayreuth, the favourite sister of Frederick the Great. During this time, under the direction of court architects, Joseph Saint-Pierre and Carl von Gontard, numerous courtly buildings and attractions were created: the Margravial Opera House with its richly furnished baroque theatre (1744–1748), the New &#x27;Castle&#x27; and Sun Temple (1749–1753) at the Hermitage, the New Palace with its courtyard garden (1754 ff) to replace the Old Palace which had burned down through the carelessness of the margrave, and the magnificent row of buildings in today&#x27;s &quot;Friedrichstraße&quot;. There was even a unique version of the rococo architectural style, the so-called Bayreuth Rococo which characterised the aforementioned buildings, especially their interior design.

The old, sombre gatehouses were demolished because they impeded transport and were an outmoded form of defence. The walls were built over in places. Margrave Frederick successfully kept his principality out of the wars being waged by his brother-in-law, Frederick the Great, at this time, and, as a result, brought a time of peace to the Frankish kingdom.

1742 saw the founding of the Frederick Academy, which became a university in 1743, but was moved that same year to Erlangen after serious riots because of the adverse reaction of the population. The university has remained there to the present today. From 1756 to 1763 there was also an Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Roman Catholics were given the right to set up a prayer room and Jewish families settled here again. In 1760 the synagogue was opened and in 1787 the Jewish cemetery was dedicated.

Countess Wilhelmina died in 1758, and although Margrave Frederick married again, the marriage was short-lived and without issue. After his death in 1763, many artists and craftsmen migrated to Berlin and Potsdam, to work for King Frederick the Great, because Frederick&#x27;s successor, Margrave Frederick Christian had little understanding of art. He also lacked the means due to the elaborate lifestyle of his predecessor, because the buildings and the salaries of the mainly foreign artists had swallowed up a lot of money. For example, the court – which under George Frederick Charles had comprised around 140 people – had grown to about 600 employees by the end of the reign of Margrave Frederick. By 1769 the principality was close to bankruptcy.

In 1769, Margrave Charles Alexander, from the Ansbach line of Frankish Hohenzollerns, followed the childless Frederick Christian, and Bayreuth was reduced to a secondary residence. Charles Alexander continued to live in Ansbach and rarely came to Bayreuth.

In 1775, the Brandenburg Pond (&quot;Brandenburger Weiher&quot;) in St.Georgen was drained.

Following the abdication of the last Margrave, Charles Alexander, from the principalities of Ansbach and Bayreuth on 2 December 1791 its territories became part of a Prussian province. The Prussian Minister Karl August von Hardenberg took over its administration at the beginning of 1792.

The town centre still possesses the typical structure of a Bavarian street market: the settlement is grouped around a road widening into a square; the Town Hall was located in the middle. The church stood apart from it and on a small hill stood the castle. Some sixty years later the town (at that time a tiny village) became subordinate to the Hohenzollern state, and when this state was divided, Bayreuth ended up in the County of Kulmbach.

===19th century===
In 1804, the author Jean Paul Richter moved from Coburg to Bayreuth, where he lived until his death in 1825.

The rule of the Hohenzollerns over the Principality of Kulmbach-Bayreuth ended in 1806 after the defeat of Prussia by Napoleonic France. During the French occupation from 1806 to 1810 Bayreuth was treated as a province of the French Empire and had to pay high war contributions. It was placed under the administration of Comte Camille de Tournon, who wrote a detailed inventory of the former Principality of Bayreuth. On 30 June 1810 the French army handed over the former principality to what was now the Kingdom of Bavaria, which it had bought from Napoleon for 15 million francs. Bayreuth became the capital of the Bavarian district of Mainkreis, which later transferred into Obermainkreis and was finally renamed as the province of Upper Franconia.

As Bavaria was opened up by the railways, the main line from Nuremberg to Hof went past Bayreuth, running via Lichtenfels, Kulmbach and Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg to Hof. Bayreuth was first given a railway connexion in 1853, when the Bayreuth–Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg railway was built at the town&#x27;s expense. It was followed in 1863 by the line to Weiden, in 1877 by the railway to Schnabelwaid, in 1896 by the branch line to Warmensteinach, in 1904 by the branch to Hollfeld and in 1909 by the branch via Thurnau to Kulmbach, known as the &quot;Thurnauer Bockala&quot; (which means something like &quot;Thurnau Goat&quot;).
On 17 April 1870 Richard Wagner visited Bayreuth, because he had read about the Margrave Opera House, whose great stage seemed fitting for his works. However, the orchestra pit could not accommodate the large number of musicians required, for example, for the Ring of the Nibelung and the ambience of the auditorium seemed inappropriate for his piece. So, he toyed with the idea of building his own festival hall (the &quot;Festspielhaus&quot;) in Bayreuth. The town supported him in this project and made a piece of land available to him, an undeveloped area outside the town between the railway station and Hohe Warte, the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Green Hill&quot;). At the same time Wagner acquired a property at &quot;Hofgarten&quot; to build his own house, &quot;Wahnfried&quot;. On 22 May 1872 the cornerstone for the Festival Hall was laid and, on 13 August 1876, it was officially opened (see Bayreuth Festival). Planning and construction were in the hands of the Leipzig architect, Otto Brückwald, who had already made a name for himself in the building of theatres in Leipzig and Altenburg.

In 1886, the composer Franz Liszt died in Bayreuth while visiting his daughter Cosima Liszt, Wagner&#x27;s widow. Both Liszt and Wagner are buried in Bayreuth; however, Wagner did not die there. Rather, he died in Venice in 1883, but his family had his body brought to Bayreuth for burial.

===20th century===

==== To the end of the Weimar Republic (1900–1933) ====
The new century also brought several innovations of modern technology: in 1892, the first electric street lights; in 1908 a municipal electricity station, and, in the same year, the first cinema.

In 1914–15, one section of the northern arm of the Red Main was straightened and widened after areas along the river had been flooded during a period of high water in 1909.

After the First World War had ended in 1918, the Workers&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Council took power briefly in Bayreuth. On 17 February 1919, there was a three-day coup, the so-called &quot;Speckputsch&quot;, a brief interlude of excitement in the otherwise rather staid town.

In a series of &quot;völkisch&quot; and nationalist &quot;Deutscher Tag&quot; (German Days), the NSDAP organised the event in Bayreuth on 30 September 1923. More than 3,300 military and civilian people gathered (equivalent to 15% of the inhabitants), although Minister of Defence Otto Gessler had forbidden the participation of units. Among the guests were mayor Albert Preu as well as Siegfried and Winifred Wagner, who invited keynote speaker Adolf Hitler to Wahnfried house. There he met writer Houston Stewart Chamberlain, son-in-law of Richard Wagner and anti-semitic race theorist. Also on that day, Hans Schemm met Hitler for the first time.

In 1932, the provinces of Upper and Middle Franconia were merged and Ansbach was chosen as the seat of government. As a small compensation, Bayreuth was given the merged state insurance agency for Upper and Middle Franconia. Unlike the provincial merger, the merger of those institutions was never reversed.

====Nazi era (1933–1945)====
A stronghold of right-wing parties since the 1920s, Bayreuth became a center of Nazi ideology. In 1933, it was made capital of the Nazi Gau Bavarian Eastern March (&quot;Bayerische Ostmark&quot;, in 1942 &quot;Gau Bayreuth&quot;). Nazi leaders often visited the Wagner festival and tried to turn Bayreuth into a Nazi model town. It was one of several places in which town planning was administered directly from Berlin, due to Hitler&#x27;s special interest in the town and in the festival. Hitler loved the music of Richard Wagner, and he became a close friend of Winifred Wagner after she took over the festival. Hitler frequently attended Wagner performances in the Bayreuth Festival Hall.

Bayreuth was to have received a so-called &quot;Gauforum&quot;, a combined government building and marching square built to symbolise the centre of power in the town. Bayreuth&#x27;s first Gauleiter was Hans Schemm, who was also the head (&quot;Reichswalter&quot;) of the National Socialist Teachers League, NSLB, which was located in Bayreuth. In 1937 the town was connected to the new &quot;Reichsautobahn&quot;.

Under Nazi dictatorship the synagogue of the Jewish Community in &quot;Münzgasse&quot; was desecrated and looted on Kristallnacht but, due to its proximity to the Opera House it was not razed. Inside the building, which is once again used by a Jewish community as a synagogue, a plaque next to the Torah Shrine recalls the persecution and murder of Jews in the Shoah, which took the lives of at least 145 Jews in Bayreuth.

During the Second World War, a subcamp of the Flossenbürg concentration camp was based in the town, in which prisoners had to participate in physical experiments for the V-2. Wieland Wagner, the grandson of the composer, Richard Wagner, was the deputy civilian director there in late 1944 and early April 1945. Shortly before the war&#x27;s end branches of the People&#x27;s Court (&quot;Volksgerichtshof&quot;) were to have been set up in Bayreuth.

On 5, 8 and 11 April 1945 about one third of the town, including many public buildings and industrial installations were destroyed by heavy air strikes, along with 4,500 houses. 741 people were also killed. On 14 April, the U.S. Army occupied the town.

====Post-war era (1945–2000)====
After the war Bayreuth tried to part with its ill-fated past. It became part of the American Zone. The American military government set up a DP camp to accommodate displaced persons (DP), many of whom were Ukrainian. The camp was supervised by the UNRRA.

The housing situation was very difficult at first: there were about 53,300 inhabitants in the town, many more than before the war began. This increase was primarily due to the high number of refugees and expellees. Even in 1948 more than 11,000 refugees were counted. In addition, because many homes had been destroyed due to the war, thousands of people were living in temporary shelters, even the festival restaurant next to the Festival Hall housed some 500 people.

In 1945, 1,400 men were conscripted by the town council for &quot;essential work&quot; (clean-up work on damaged buildings and the clearing of roads). A significant number of historic buildings were demolished post-war but cultural life was soon back on track: in 1947 Mozart festival weeks were held in the Opera House, from which the Franconian Festival Weeks developed. In 1949 the Festival Hall was used for the first time again and there was a gala concert with the Vienna Philharmonic led by Hans Knappertsbusch. In 1951, the first post-war Richard Wagner Festival took place under the leadership of Wieland and Wolfgang Wagner. Wieland Wagner&#x27;s fresh and non-traditional stagings &quot;restored credibility to a theater that had been totally ruined by Nazi ideology.&quot;

In 1949, Bayreuth became the seat of the government of Upper Franconia again.

In 1971, the Bavarian State Parliament decided to establish the University of Bayreuth and, on 3 November 1975, it opened for lectures and research. There are now about 10,000 students in the town.

In May 1972, a serious accident occurred at the folk festival in the town, when an overcrowded carriage derailed and several people were thrown out. Four died and five were injured, some seriously. At that time, it was the worst disaster on a roller coaster since the Second World War.

In 1979, US Army serviceman Roy Chung disappeared from the area and allegedly defected to North Korea via East Germany.

In 1999, the world gliding championship took place at Bayreuth municipal airport.

===21st century===
In 2006, Bayreuth chose its first CSU member and mayor, the lawyer, Michael Hohl, and, in 2007, a Youth Parliament, consisting of 12 young people, aged 14–17 years, was elected for the first time. The end of October saw the opening of the long-planned bus station and its associated office building on the newly created &quot;Hohenzollernplatz&quot;.

===Richard Wagner and Bayreuth===
The town is best known for its association with the composer Richard Wagner, who lived in Bayreuth from 1872 until his death in 1883. Wagner&#x27;s villa, &quot;Wahnfried&quot;, was constructed in Bayreuth under the sponsorship of King Ludwig II of Bavaria and was converted after World War II into a Wagner Museum. In the northern part of Bayreuth is the Festival Hall, an opera house specially constructed for and exclusively devoted to the performance of Wagner&#x27;s operas. The premieres of the final two works of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring Cycle&quot; (&quot;Siegfried&quot; and &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;); the cycle as a whole; and of &quot;Parsifal&quot; took place here.

Every summer, Wagner&#x27;s operas are performed at the Festspielhaus during the month-long Richard Wagner Festival, commonly known as the Bayreuth Festival. The Festival draws thousands each year and has persistently been sold out since its inauguration in 1876. Currently, waiting lists for tickets can stretch for 10 years or more.

Owing to Wagner&#x27;s relationship with the then unknown philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, the first Bayreuth festival is cited as a key turning point in Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophical development. Though at first an enthusiastic champion of Wagner&#x27;s music, Nietzsche ultimately became hostile, viewing the festival and its revellers as symptom of cultural decay and bourgeois decadence – an event which led him to turn his eye upon the moral values esteemed by society as a whole – &quot;Nietzsche clearly preferred to see Bayreuth fail than succeed by mirroring a society gone wrong.&quot;

===Sponsorship===
In 1955 Bayreuth took on sponsorship for displaced Sudeten Germans from the town of Franzensbad in Okres Cheb.

===Coat of arms===
Margrave Albert Achilles, who was also Elector of Brandenburg, presented the town of Bayreuth in December 1457 with the coat of arms that it still bears today. Two fields show the black and white coat of arms of the Hohenzollerns. The black lion on gold with a red and white border was the municipal coat of arms of the burgraves of Nuremberg. Along the two diagonals are two &quot;Reuten&quot;, small triangular shovels with a slightly bent shaft. They represent the ending &quot;-reuth&quot; in the town&#x27;s name.&quot;

==Culture and places of interest==

===Theatre===
The Margravial Opera House was opened in 1748 and is one of the finest Baroque theatres in Europe. The UNESCO World Heritage Site is both a museum and the oldest working &quot;tableau&quot; in Bayreuth.

The Festival Hall dates to the 19th century and is now used solely for the Bayreuth Festival. Only works by Richard Wagner are performed.

The former &quot;Stadthalle&quot; (lit.: city hall) did not have its own ensemble but was regularly used by the &quot;Theater Hof&quot; as well as various travelling theatres. It has been under reconstruction since 2017 and is supposed to be re-opened under the new name &quot;Friedrichsforum&quot; in 2023.

The only two theatres with their own ensemble are the &quot;Studiobühne Bayreuth&quot; and amateur dramatic society, &quot;Brandenburg Kulturstadt&quot;. The venues of the &quot;Studiobühne&quot; are the domicile of the theatre in the &quot;Röntgenstraße&quot;, the artificial ruins of the Hermitage and the courtyard of piano manufacturer Steingraeber &amp; Söhne.

===Museums===
* The Richard Wagner Museum at Wahnfried House was the residence of Richard Wagner and his family&#x27;s home until 1966. Since 1976 it has been a museum with attached national archives and a research centre for the Richard Wagner Foundation in Bayreuth.
* The Jean Paul Museum in the former residence of Richard Wagner&#x27;s daughter, Eva Chamberlain, with autographs, first editions of works, portraits and other pictorial material.
* The Franz Liszt Museum in the house where Franz Liszt died, with about 300 photographs, scripts and printed papers from the collection of the Munich pianist, Ernst Burger, which were bought by the town of Bayreuth. In addition there is a &quot;Stummklavier&quot;, made by the Ibach company of Haus Wahnfried, letters and first editions of Franz Liszt. Biographic information boards, a mould of the font from Liszt&#x27;s birthplace Raiding, Austria and Liszt busts by Antonio Galli enhance the collection. Visits are accompanied by the music of Franz Liszt.
* The Historical Museum in the Old Latin School on &quot;Kirchplatz&quot;. On the ground floor it portrays the history and development of Bayreuth from the late Middle Ages to the 20th century with a model of the town in the year 1763. On the first floor are divisions covering the art and cultural history of Bayreuth&#x27;s margravial period (17th and 18th centuries). Another division portrays arts and crafts in Bayreuth and the surrounding area with examples of faience pottery, glass products from the Fichtelgebirge and stone pottery from Creußen. Painting, crafts, and early industrial artefacts from the Biedermeier period and the late 19th century round off a visit to the museum.
* The Museum of Art in the Old Town Hall which contains the Helmut and Constanze Meyer Art Foundation, the Georg Tappert collection and the archives and collection of Caspar Walter Rauh. The collections contain key works from the 20th century. They also include the Little Poster Museum (formerly a museum on its own, the collection was integrated into the Museum of Art in 2012) and the British American Tobacco&#x27;s Historical Collection.
* The German Typewriter Museum with a collection of over 400 historic typewriters from the Research and Training Centre for Shorthand and Word Processing in Bayreuth.
* A branch of the Bavarian State Painting Collection was opened in the New Palace in August 2007. 80 works from Dutch and German painters of the late 17th century and 18th century are displayed.
* The Archaeological Museum in the Italian Building of the New Palace was founded in 1827 by the Historic Society. Its eight exhibition rooms include artefacts such as New Stone Age stone axes, 80 pottery jars from the Hallstatt era and Celtic bronze jewellery. The discoveries on display, which all come from eastern Upper Franconia, especially Franconian Switzerland and the region around Bayreuth, date from the Old Stone Age to the Middle Ages. In the experimental field there is a reconstructed loom, a rock drill and an original &quot;Schiebemühle&quot;.
* Maisel&#x27;s Brewery and Cooper&#x27;s Museum teaches everything about the production of Weizen beer on a layout, making it the largest brewery in the world, not least due to its collection of over 5,500 beer glasses and mugs.
* The Upper Franconia Prehistory Museum portrays the history of life in Upper Franconia since the beginning of the world. Exhibitions are constantly changing; currently the life-size dinosaurs attract especial interest.

==Economy and infrastructure==

===Transport===

====Long-distance roads====
Motorways (&quot;Autobahnen&quot;):
* A 9: Berlin–Leipzig–&quot;Bayreuth&quot;–Nuremberg–Ingolstadt–Munich
* A 70: Schweinfurt–Bamberg–&quot;Bayreuth&quot;

Federal roads (&quot;Bundesstraßen&quot;):
* B 2: Rosow–Berlin–Lutherstadt Wittenberg–Leipzig–Gera–Hof–&quot;Bayreuth&quot;–Nuremberg–Donauwörth–Augsburg–Munich–Mittenwald
* B 22: Würzburg–Bamberg–Hollfeld–&quot;Bayreuth&quot;–Weiden–Cham
* B 85: Berga–Weimar–Ludwigsstadt–Kulmbach–&quot;Bayreuth&quot;–Amberg–Schwandorf–Cham–Neukirchen vorm Wald–Passau

====Railways====
From Bayreuth Central Station (&quot;Hauptbahnhof&quot;) railway lines run north to Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg, and from there to Bamberg and over the Schiefe Ebene to Hof, east to Weidenberg, southeast to Weiden and south to Schnabelwaid with connections to Nuremberg on the Pegnitz Valley Railway. The lines around Bayreuth are all single-tracked and non-electrified.

Since 23 May 1992 tilting Class 610 diesel multiple units have worked the Pegnitz Valley route. These were bought by the former Deutsche Bundesbahn specifically for the winding track.

Since a 2006/2007 timetable change, Bayreuth has no longer been connected to the DB&#x27;s long-distance network. However, the Franken-Sachsen-Express still provides a direct connection to Dresden (since December 2007, every two hours). This service is worked by Class 612 diesel multiple units. There are also Regional-Express links via Lichtenfels to Bamberg and Würzburg, and via Lichtenfels and Kronach to Saalfeld.

====Local public transport====

The town bus routes are operated by Bayreuth Transport and Public Baths (BVB) (). Sometimes private bus operators run services on behalf of the transport companies. The 15 routes (lines 301–315) operate from Monday to Friday at 20 or 30-minute intervals; on Saturday and Sunday the interval is extended to 30 minutes. Late evening services (from about 20 to 12 pm during the week and to 1 am at weekends), on Sunday mornings a simplified network of six lines (lines 321–326) runs buses at 30-minute intervals. Some lines then operate like an on-call taxi service. The network is star-shaped. Originally, the central station was at the market square in . Since 27 October 2007 the Central Bus Station (ZOH) has been at at the junction of on the . At this stop there are also bus stops for local buses to facilitate transfers.

Regional rail is operated by the Omnibusverkehr Franken. From 1 January 2010 public transport from the town and district of Bayreuth was integrated into the Nuremberg Regional Transport Network ().

====Cycling====
In most places there is a signed cycle path network. In the centre of Bayreuth itself, cycling is fairly straightforward due to the relatively flat topography, something which encourages the use bicycles as an everyday means of transport. Because of the proximity of the 600 kilometre long Main Cycleway, Bayreuth is also a destination for many tourist cycle routes. Because of the long service intervals of the Bayreuth town bus system and its long overnight pause, students use bicycles as their everyday mode of transport. Bicycles may be carried for a fee on DB Regio trains leaving Bayreuth and in the VGN&#x27;s buses.

====Air transport====
The local airport supports Bayreuth&#x27;s commercial aviation traffic, individual business travel, general aviation and air sports. There is no commercial service any more: In 2001, the service which used to operate three times a day from Frankfurt via Bayreuth to Hof, stopped service.

The airfield at Bindlacher Berg is also one of the most important bases for gliding in Germany. For example, the World Championships took place here in 1999. For the air sports community in Bayreuth, the airport is a departure point for glider flights taking part in the national Bundesliga competition league. The local gliding club also provides instruction in flying gliders and light aircraft.

In the early 1990s, following the end of the Cold War the garrison tradition of the town came to an end when the &quot;Bundeswehr&#x27;s&quot; Margrave Barracks (&quot;Markgrafenkaserne&quot;) and the Röhrensee Barracks (&quot;Röhrenseekaserne&quot;), used by the US Army and the BGS (&quot;Grenzschutzabteilung Süd 3&quot;), were closed.

<doc id="49526" wikidata="Q10858537" url="?curid=49526" title="Scale (ratio)">
<text>The scale ratio of a model represents the proportional ratio of a linear dimension of the model to the same feature of the original. Examples include a 3-dimensional scale model of a building or the scale drawings of the elevations or plans of a building.
In such cases the scale is dimensionless and exact throughout the model or drawing.

The scale can be expressed in four ways: in words (a lexical scale), as a ratio, as a fraction and as a graphical (bar) scale. Thus on an architect&#x27;s drawing one might read &#x27;one centimeter to one meter&#x27;, 1:100, 1/100, or . A bar scale would also normally appear on the drawing. Colon may also be substituted with a specific, slightly raised ratio symbol , ie. .
==General representation==
Generally, a representation may involve more than one scale at the same time. For example, a drawing showing a new road in elevation might use different horizontal and vertical scales. An elevation of a bridge might be annotated with arrows with a length proportional to a force loading, as in 1 cm to 1000 newtons: this is an example of a dimensional scale. A weather map at some scale may be annotated with wind arrows at a dimensional scale of 1 cm to 20 mph.

==In maps==

Map scales require careful discussion. A town plan may be constructed as an exact scale drawing, but for larger areas a map projection is necessary and no projection can represent the Earth&#x27;s surface at a uniform scale. In general, the scale of a projection depends on position and direction. The variation of scale may be considerable in small scale maps which may cover the globe. In large scale maps of small areas, the variation of scale may be insignificant for most purposes, but it is always present. The scale of a map projection must be interpreted as a nominal scale. (The usage &quot;large&quot; and &quot;small&quot; in relation to map scales relates to their expressions as fractions. The fraction 1/10,000 used for a local map is much &quot;larger&quot; than the 1/100,000,000 used for a global map. There is no fixed dividing line between small and large scales.)

== Mathematics ==
In mathematics, the idea of geometric scaling can be generalized. The scale between two mathematical objects need not be a fixed ratio but may vary in some systematic way; this is part of mathematical projection, which generally defines a point by point relationship between two mathematical objects. (Generally, these may be mathematical sets and may not represent geometric objects.)

<text>The Baen Free Library is a digital library of the science fiction and fantasy publishing house Baen Books where 61 e-books as of June 2016 (112 e-books as of December 2008) can be downloaded free in a number of formats, without copy protection. It was founded in late 1999 by science fiction writer Eric Flint and publisher Jim Baen to determine whether the availability of books free of charge on the Internet encourages or discourages the sale of their paper books.

The Baen Free Library represents an experiment in the field of intellectual property and copyright. It appears that sales of both the e-books made available free and other books by the same author, even from a different publisher, increase when the electronic version is made available free of charge.

Baen Ebooks also sells individual e-books and a subscription-based e-book program. The books in the Free Library are available via the website for Baen Ebooks in various formats including HTML, Rich Text Format, and EPUB as well as unencrypted .mobi for Kindle.

== Baen CDs ==
In 2002, Baen also started adding CD-ROMs into some hardcovers of newest titles in successful series. They contain the complete series of novels preceding the printed book (for those books that were the latest in a series), other works by the same author, some works by other authors, and multimedia bonuses. The CD-ROMs have a prominent permissive copyright license which expressly encourages free-of-charge copying and sharing, including over the Internet.

Some of these CDs also contain MP3 audiobook versions. As of 2015 CD 24 &quot;Invasion&quot; published in 2010 was the last promotional &quot;Baen CD&quot;.

* CD 01 Honorverse also contains &quot;The Shadow of the Lion&quot; and &quot;1632&quot; among others.
* CD 06 Wind Rider&#x27;s Oath and CD 06b &quot;Shadow of Saganami&quot; were published in 2004.
* CD 13 &quot;1634: The Baltic War&quot; and CD 13 &quot;The Best of Jim Baen&#x27;s Universe 2006&quot; were published in 2006.
* CD 22 &quot;Mission of Honor&quot; also contains &quot;Exodus&quot; and &quot;1633&quot; among others.
* CD 23 &quot;1635: The Eastern Front&quot; features the 1632 and Heirs of Alexandria series among others.
* CD 24 &quot;Cryoburn&quot; was replaced by CD 24 &quot;Invasion&quot; in the Secret World Chronicles.

<text>The Battle of the Milvian Bridge took place between the Roman Emperors Constantine I and Maxentius on 28 October AD 312. It takes its name from the Milvian Bridge, an important route over the Tiber. Constantine won the battle and started on the path that led him to end the Tetrarchy and become the sole ruler of the Roman Empire. Maxentius drowned in the Tiber during the battle; his body was later taken from the river and decapitated, and his head was paraded through the streets of Rome on the day following the battle before being taken to Africa.

According to Christian chroniclers Eusebius of Caesarea and Lactantius, the battle marked the beginning of Constantine&#x27;s conversion to Christianity. Eusebius of Caesarea recounts that Constantine and his soldiers had a vision sent by the Christian God. This was interpreted as a promise of victory if the sign of the Chi Rho, the first two letters of Christ&#x27;s name in Greek, was painted on the soldiers&#x27; shields. The Arch of Constantine, erected in celebration of the victory, certainly attributes Constantine&#x27;s success to divine intervention; however, the monument does not display any overtly Christian symbolism.

== Historical background ==
The underlying causes of the battle were the rivalries inherent in Diocletian&#x27;s Tetrarchy. After Diocletian stepped down on 1 May 305, his successors began to struggle for control of the Roman Empire almost immediately. Although Constantine was the son of the Western Emperor Constantius, the Tetrarchic ideology did not necessarily provide for hereditary succession. When Constantius died on 25 July 306, his father&#x27;s troops proclaimed Constantine as Augustus in Eboracum (York). In Rome, the favorite was Maxentius, the son of Constantius&#x27; imperial colleague Maximian, who seized the title of emperor on 28 October 306. But whereas Constantine&#x27;s claim was recognized by Galerius, ruler of the Eastern provinces and the senior emperor in the Empire, Maxentius was treated as a usurper. Galerius, however, recognized Constantine as holding only the lesser imperial rank of Caesar. Galerius ordered his co-Augustus, Severus, to put Maxentius down in early 307. Once Severus arrived in Italy, however, his army defected to Maxentius. Severus was captured, imprisoned, and executed. Galerius himself marched on Rome in the autumn, but failed to take the city. Constantine avoided conflict with both Maxentius and the Eastern emperors for most of this period.

By 312, however, Constantine and Maxentius were engaged in open hostility with one another, although they were brothers-in‑law through Constantine&#x27;s marriage to Fausta, sister of Maxentius. In the spring of 312, Constantine gathered an army of around 40,000 soldiers (although the ancient historian Zosimus &quot;claimed, quite implausibly, that Constantine invaded Italy with 90,000 soldiers and 8,000 cavalry, and that Maxentius commanded an army of 170,000 soldiers and 18,000 cavalry, including 80,000 Italians and 40,000 Carthaginians&quot;) and decided to oust Maxentius himself. He easily overran northern Italy, winning two major battles: the first near Turin, the second at Verona, where the praetorian prefect Ruricius Pompeianus, Maxentius&#x27; most senior general, was killed.

==Vision of Constantine==

It is commonly understood that on the evening of 27 October with the armies preparing for battle, Constantine had a vision which led him to fight under the protection of the Christian God. Some details of that vision, however, differ between the sources reporting it.

Lactantius states that, on the night before the battle, Constantine was commanded in a dream to &quot;delineate the heavenly sign on the shields of his soldiers&quot; (&quot;On the Deaths of the Persecutors&quot; 44.5). He followed the commands of his dream and marked the shields with a sign &quot;denoting Christ&quot;. Lactantius describes that sign as a &quot;staurogram&quot;, or a Latin cross with its upper end rounded in a P-like fashion. There is no certain evidence that Constantine ever used that sign, as opposed to the better known Chi-Rho sign described by Eusebius.
From Eusebius, two accounts of the battle survive. The first, shorter one in the &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; promotes the belief that the Christian God helped Constantine but does not mention any vision. In his later &quot;Life of Constantine&quot;, Eusebius gives a detailed account of a vision and stresses that he had heard the story from the Emperor himself. According to this version, Constantine with his army was marching (Eusebius does not specify the actual location of the event, but it was clearly not in the camp at Rome), when he looked up to the sun and saw a cross of light above it, and with it the Greek words &quot; Ἐν Τούτῳ Νίκα&quot;, &quot;En toutōi níka&quot;, usually translated into Latin as &quot;in hoc signo vinces&quot;. The literal meaning of the phrase in Greek is &quot;in this (sign), conquer&quot; while in Latin it&#x27;s &quot;in this sign, you shall conquer&quot;; a more free translation would be &quot;Through this sign [you shall] conquer&quot;. At first he was unsure of the meaning of the apparition, but in the following night he had a dream in which Christ explained to him that he should use the sign against his enemies. Eusebius then continues to describe the labarum, the military standard used by Constantine in his later wars against Licinius, showing the Chi-Rho sign.

The accounts of the two contemporary authors, though not entirely consistent, have been merged into a popular notion of Constantine seeing the Chi-Rho sign on the evening before the battle. Both authors agree that the sign was not widely understandable to denote Christ (although among the Christians, it was already being used in the catacombs along with other special symbols to mark and/or decorate Christian tombs). Its first imperial appearance is on a Constantinian silver coin from 317, which proves that Constantine did use the sign at that time, though not very prominently. He made more extensive use of the Chi-Rho and the Labarum later, during the conflict with Licinius.
Some have considered the vision in a solar context (e.g. as a solar halo phenomenon called a sun dog), which may have preceded the Christian beliefs later expressed by Constantine. Coins of Constantine depicting him as the companion of a solar deity were minted as late as 313, the year following the battle. The solar deity Sol Invictus is often pictured with a nimbus or halo. Various emperors portrayed Sol Invictus on their official coinage, with a wide range of legends, only a few of which incorporated the epithet &quot;invictus&quot;, such as the legend , claiming the Unconquered Sun as a companion to the emperor, used with particular frequency by Constantine. Constantine&#x27;s official coinage continues to bear images of Sol until 325/6. A solidus of Constantine as well as a gold medallion from his reign depict the Emperor&#x27;s bust in profile jugate with Sol Invictus, with the legend . The official cults of Sol Invictus and Sol Invictus Mithras were popular amongst the soldiers of the Roman Army. Statuettes of Sol Invictus, carried by the standard-bearers, appear in three places in reliefs on the Arch of Constantine. Constantine&#x27;s triumphal arch was carefully positioned to align with the colossal statue of Sol by the Colosseum, so that Sol formed the dominant backdrop when seen from the direction of the main approach towards the arch.

However, other historians have discounted Eusebius&#x27;s later account of a vision entirely. John Julius Norwich argued that &quot;the vision of the Cross above the battlefield ... never occurred. Had it done so, it is unthinkable that there should not be a single reference to it in any of the contemporary histories until the &quot;Life of Constantine&quot;&quot;, and that Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;specific statement that &#x27;the whole army ... witnessed the miracle&#x27;&quot; is implausible. On the other hand, Norwich did concede that shortly before the battle, Constantine must have undergone &quot;some profound spiritual experience&quot;, and that Eusebius&#x27;s story was likely not so much &quot;a deliberate falsehood&quot; as &quot;a possibly unconscious exaggeration&quot;, with Constantine adding &quot;a gentle gloss&quot; to his recollections which the author then uncritically noted down or embellished.

==Events of the battle==
Constantine reached Rome at the end of October 312 approaching along the Via Flaminia. He camped at the location of Malborghetto near Prima Porta, where remains of a Constantinian monument, the Arch of Malborghetto, which was built in honour of the occasion, are still extant.

It was expected that Maxentius would remain within Rome and endure a siege; he had successfully employed this strategy twice before, during the invasions of Severus and Galerius. Indeed, Maxentius had organised the stockpiling of large amounts of food in the city in preparation for such an event. Surprisingly, he decided otherwise, choosing to meet Constantine in open battle. Ancient sources commenting on these events attribute this decision either to divine intervention (Lactantius and Eusebius, both of whom were Christians) or superstition (Zosimus, who was a pagan). They also note that the day of the battle was the same as the day of his accession (28 October), which was generally thought to be a good omen. Additionally, Maxentius is reported to have consulted the oracular Sibylline Books, which stated that &quot;on October 28 an enemy of the Romans would perish&quot;. Maxentius interpreted this prophecy as being favourable to himself. Lactantius also reports that the populace supported Constantine with acclamations during circus games. Maxentius chose to make his stand in front of the Milvian Bridge, a stone bridge that carries the Via Flaminia road across the Tiber River into Rome (the bridge stands today at the same site, somewhat remodelled, named in Italian &quot;Ponte Milvio&quot; or sometimes &quot;Ponte Molle&quot;, &quot;soft bridge&quot;). Holding it was essential if Maxentius was to keep his rival out of Rome, where the Senate would surely favour whoever held the city. As Maxentius had probably partially destroyed the bridge during his preparations for a siege, he had a wooden or pontoon bridge constructed to get his army across the river. The sources vary as to the nature of the bridge central to the events of the battle. Zosimus mentions it, vaguely, as being constructed in two parts connected by iron fastenings, while others indicate that it was a pontoon bridge; sources are also unclear as to whether the bridge was deliberately constructed as a collapsible trap for Constantine&#x27;s forces or not.
The next day, the two armies clashed, and Constantine won a decisive victory. The dispositions of Maxentius may have been faulty as his troops seem to have been arrayed with the River Tiber too close to their rear, giving them little space to allow re-grouping in the event of their formations being forced to give ground. Already known as a skillful general, Constantine first launched his cavalry at the cavalry of Maxentius and broke them. Constantine&#x27;s infantry then advanced; most of Maxentius&#x27;s troops fought well but they began to be pushed back toward the Tiber. Maxentius then decided to order a retreat, intending to make another stand at Rome itself. However, there was only one escape route, via the bridge. Constantine&#x27;s men inflicted heavy losses on the retreating army. Finally, the temporary bridge set up alongside the Milvian Bridge, over which many of the Maxentian troops were escaping, collapsed, and those stranded on the north bank of the Tiber were either taken prisoner or killed. Maxentius&#x27; Praetorian Guard, who had originally acclaimed him emperor, seem to have made a stubborn stand on the northern bank of the river; &quot;in despair of pardon they covered with their bodies the place which they had chosen for combat.&quot;

Maxentius was among the dead, having drowned in the river while trying to swim across it in an attempt to escape or, alternatively, he is described as having been thrown by his horse into the river. Lactantius describes the death of Maxentius in the following manner: &quot;The bridge in his rear was broken down. At sight of that the battle grew hotter. The hand of the Lord prevailed, and the forces of Maxentius were routed. He fled towards the broken bridge; but the multitude pressing on him, he was driven headlong into the Tiber.&quot;
==Aftermath==

Constantine entered Rome on 29 October. He staged a grand arrival ceremony in the city (&quot;adventus)&quot;, and was met with popular jubilation. Maxentius&#x27; body was fished out of the Tiber and decapitated. His head was paraded through the streets for all to see. After the ceremonies, Maxentius&#x27; head was sent to Carthage as proof of his downfall; Africa then offered no further resistance. The battle gave Constantine undisputed control of the western half of the Roman Empire. The descriptions of Constantine&#x27;s entry into Rome omit mention of him ending his procession at the temple of Capitoline Jupiter, where sacrifice was usually offered. Though often employed to show Constantine&#x27;s Christian sensibilities, this silence cannot be taken as proof that Constantine was a Christian at this point. He chose to honour the Senatorial Curia with a visit, where he promised to restore its ancestral privileges and give it a secure role in his reformed government: there would be no revenge against Maxentius&#x27; supporters. Maxentius was condemned to &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;; all his legislation was invalidated and Constantine usurped all of Maxentius&#x27; considerable building projects within Rome, including the Temple of Romulus and the Basilica of Maxentius. Maxentius&#x27; strongest supporters in the military were neutralized when the Praetorian Guard and Imperial Horse Guard (&quot;equites singulares&quot;) were disbanded. Constantine is thought to have replaced the former imperial guards with a number of cavalry units termed the &quot;Scholae Palatinae&quot;.

==Significance==

Paul K. Davis writes that, &quot;Constantine’s victory gave him total control of the Western Roman Empire paving the way for Christianity to become the dominant religion for the Roman Empire and ultimately for Europe.&quot; The following year, 313, Constantine and Licinius issued the Edict of Milan, which made Christianity an officially recognised and tolerated religion in the Roman Empire.

<text>A thought experiment is a hypothetical situation in which a hypothesis, theory, or principle is laid out for the purpose of thinking through its consequences. The concept is also referred to using the German-language term  within the work of the physicist Ernst Mach and includes thoughts about what may have occurred if a different course of action were taken. The importance of this ability is that it allows the experimenter to imagine what may occur in the future, as well as the implications of alternate courses of action.

==History==
The ancient Greek , &quot;was the most ancient pattern of mathematical proof&quot;, and existed before Euclidean mathematics, where the emphasis was on the conceptual, rather than on the experimental part of a thought experiment.

Johann Witt-Hansen established that Hans Christian Ørsted was the first to use the equivalent German term . Ørsted was also the first to use the equivalent term in 1820.

By 1883, Ernst Mach used in a different sense, to denote exclusively the conduct of a experiment that would be subsequently performed as a by his students. Physical and mental experimentation could then be contrasted: Mach asked his students to provide him with explanations whenever the results from their subsequent, real, physical experiment differed from those of their prior, imaginary experiment.

The English term &quot;thought experiment&quot; was coined as a calque of , and it first appeared in the 1897 English translation of one of Mach&#x27;s papers. Prior to its emergence, the activity of posing hypothetical questions that employed subjunctive reasoning had existed for a very long time for both scientists and philosophers. The irrealis moods are ways to categorize it or to speak about it. This helps explain the extremely wide and diverse range of the application of the term &quot;thought experiment&quot; once it had been introduced into English.
Galileo&#x27;s demonstration that falling objects must fall at the same rate regardless of their masses was a significant step forward in the history of modern science. This is widely thought to have been a straightforward physical demonstration, involving climbing up the Leaning Tower of Pisa and dropping two heavy weights off it, whereas in fact, it was a logical demonstration, using the thought experiment technique. The experiment is described by Galileo in (1638) (from Italian: &#x27;Mathematical Discourses and Demonstrations&#x27;) thus:

==Uses==
The common goal of a thought experiment is to explore the potential consequences of the principle in question:
::&quot;A thought experiment is a device with which one performs an intentional, structured process of intellectual deliberation in order to speculate, within a specifiable problem domain, about potential consequents (or antecedents) for a designated antecedent (or consequent).&quot; Yeates, 2004, p. 150.

Given the structure of the experiment, it may not be possible to perform it; and, even if it could be performed, there need not be an intention to perform it.

Examples of thought experiments include Schrödinger&#x27;s cat, illustrating quantum indeterminacy through the manipulation of a perfectly sealed environment and a tiny bit of radioactive substance, and Maxwell&#x27;s demon, which attempts to demonstrate the ability of a hypothetical finite being to violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics.

It is a common element of science-fiction stories.

Thought experiments, which are well-structured, well-defined hypothetical questions that employ subjunctive reasoning (irrealis moods) – &quot;What might happen (or, what might have happened) if . . . &quot; – have been used to pose questions in philosophy at least since Greek antiquity, some pre-dating Socrates. In physics and other sciences many thought experiments date from the 19th and especially the 20th Century, but examples can be found at least as early as Galileo.

In thought experiments, we gain new information by rearranging or reorganizing already known empirical data in a new way and drawing new (a priori) inferences from them, or by looking at these data from a different and unusual perspective. In Galileo&#x27;s thought experiment, for example, the rearrangement of empirical experience consists of the original idea of combining bodies of different weights.

Thought experiments have been used in philosophy (especially ethics), physics, and other fields (such as cognitive psychology, history, political science, economics, social psychology, law, organizational studies, marketing, and epidemiology). In law, the synonym &quot;hypothetical&quot; is frequently used for such experiments.

Regardless of their intended goal, all thought experiments display a patterned way of thinking that is designed to allow us to explain, predict, and control events in a better and more productive way.

===Theoretical consequences===
In terms of their theoretical consequences, thought experiments generally:

* challenge (or even refute) a prevailing theory, often involving the device known as reductio ad absurdum, (as in Galileo&#x27;s original argument, a proof by contradiction),
* confirm a prevailing theory,
* establish a new theory, or
* simultaneously refute a prevailing theory and establish a new theory through a process of mutual exclusion

===Practical applications===
Thought experiments can produce some very important and different outlooks on previously unknown or unaccepted theories. However, they may make those theories themselves irrelevant, and could possibly create new problems that are just as difficult, or possibly more difficult to resolve.

In terms of their practical application, thought experiments are generally created to:

* challenge the prevailing status quo (which includes activities such as correcting misinformation (or misapprehension), identify flaws in the argument(s) presented, to preserve (for the long-term) objectively established fact, and to refute specific assertions that some particular thing is permissible, forbidden, known, believed, possible, or necessary);
* extrapolate beyond (or interpolate within) the boundaries of already established fact;
* predict and forecast the (otherwise) indefinite and unknowable future;
* explain the past;
* the retrodiction, postdiction and hindcasting of the (otherwise) indefinite and unknowable past;
* facilitate decision making, choice, and strategy selection;
* solve problems, and generate ideas;
* move current (often insoluble) problems into another, more helpful, and more productive problem space (e.g.: functional fixedness);
* attribute causation, preventability, blame, and responsibility for specific outcomes;
* assess culpability and compensatory damages in social and legal contexts;
* ensure the repeat of past success; or
* examine the extent to which past events might have occurred differently.
* ensure the (future) avoidance of past failures

==Types==

Generally speaking, there are seven types of thought experiments in which one reasons from causes to effects, or effects to causes:

===Prefactual===
&quot;Prefactual (before the fact) thought experiments&quot; – the term prefactual was coined by Lawrence J. Sanna in 1998 – speculate on possible future outcomes, given the present, and ask &quot;What will be the outcome if event E occurs?&quot;.

===Counterfactual===

&quot;Counterfactual (contrary to established fact) thought experiments&quot; – the term &quot;counterfactual&quot; was coined by Nelson Goodman in 1947, extending Roderick Chisholm&#x27;s (1946) notion of a &quot;contrary-to-fact conditional&quot; – speculate on the possible outcomes of a different past; and ask &quot;What might have happened if A had happened instead of B?&quot; (e.g., &quot;If Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz had cooperated with each other, what would mathematics look like today?&quot;).

The study of counterfactual speculation has increasingly engaged the interest of scholars in a wide range of domains such as philosophy, psychology, cognitive psychology, history, political science, economics, social psychology, law, organizational theory, marketing, and epidemiology.

===Semifactual===

&quot;Semifactual thought experiments&quot; – the term &quot;semifactual&quot; was coined by Nelson Goodman in 1947 – speculate on the extent to which things might have remained the same, despite there being a different past; and asks the question Even though X happened instead of E, would Y have still occurred? (e.g., Even if the goalie had moved left, rather than right, could he have intercepted a ball that was traveling at such a speed?).

Semifactual speculations are an important part of clinical medicine.

===Predictive===

The activity of prediction attempts to project the circumstances of the present into the future. According to David Sarewitz and Roger Pielke (1999, p123), scientific prediction takes two forms:

# &quot;The elucidation of invariant – and therefore predictive – principles of nature&quot;; and
# &quot;[Using] suites of observational data and sophisticated numerical models in an effort to foretell the behavior or evolution of complex phenomena&quot;.

Although they perform different social and scientific functions, the only difference between the qualitatively identical activities of &quot;predicting&quot;, &quot;forecasting,&quot; and &quot;nowcasting&quot; is the distance of the speculated future from the present moment occupied by the user. Whilst the activity of nowcasting, defined as &quot;a detailed description of the current weather along with forecasts obtained by extrapolation up to 2 hours ahead&quot;, is essentially concerned with describing the current state of affairs, it is common practice to extend the term &quot;to cover very-short-range forecasting up to 12 hours ahead&quot; (Browning, 1982, p.ix).

===Hindcasting===

The activity of hindcasting involves running a forecast model after an event has happened in order to test whether the model&#x27;s simulation is valid.

===Retrodiction===

The activity of &quot;retrodiction&quot; (or &quot;postdiction&quot;) involves moving backward in time, step-by-step, in as many stages as are considered necessary, from the present into the speculated past to establish the ultimate cause of a specific event (e.g., reverse engineering and forensics).

Given that retrodiction is a process in which &quot;past observations, events, add and data are used as evidence to infer the process(es) that produced them&quot; and that diagnosis &quot;involve[s] going from visible effects such as symptoms, signs and the like to their prior causes&quot;, the essential balance between prediction and retrodiction could be characterized as:

regardless of whether the prognosis is of the course of the disease in the absence of treatment, or of the application of a specific treatment regimen to a specific disorder in a particular patient.

===Backcasting===

The activity of &quot;backcasting&quot; – the term &quot;backcasting&quot; was coined by John Robinson in 1982 – involves establishing the description of a very definite and very specific future situation. It then involves an imaginary moving backward in time, step-by-step, in as many stages as are considered necessary, from the future to the present to reveal the mechanism through which that particular specified future could be attained from the present.

Backcasting is not concerned with predicting the future:

According to Jansen (1994, p. 503:

==Fields==
Thought experiments have been used in a variety of fields, including philosophy, law, physics, and mathematics. In philosophy they have been used at least since classical antiquity, some pre-dating Socrates. In law, they were well known to Roman lawyers quoted in the Digest. In physics and other sciences, notable thought experiments date from the 19th and, especially, the 20th century; but examples can be found at least as early as Galileo.

===Philosophy===
In philosophy, a thought experiment typically presents an imagined scenario with the intention of eliciting an intuitive or reasoned response about the way things are in the thought experiment. (Philosophers might also supplement their thought experiments with theoretical reasoning designed to support the desired intuitive response.) The scenario will typically be designed to target a particular philosophical notion, such as morality, or the nature of the mind or linguistic reference. The response to the imagined scenario is supposed to tell us about the nature of that notion in any scenario, real or imagined.

For example, a thought experiment might present a situation in which an agent intentionally kills an innocent for the benefit of others. Here, the relevant question is not whether the action is moral or not, but more broadly whether a moral theory is correct that says morality is determined solely by an action&#x27;s consequences (See Consequentialism). John Searle imagines a man in a locked room who receives written sentences in Chinese, and returns written sentences in Chinese, according to a sophisticated instruction manual. Here, the relevant question is not whether or not the man understands Chinese, but more broadly, whether a functionalist theory of mind is correct.

It is generally hoped that there is universal agreement about the intuitions that a thought experiment elicits. (Hence, in assessing their own thought experiments, philosophers may appeal to &quot;what we should say,&quot; or some such locution.) A successful thought experiment will be one in which intuitions about it are widely shared. But often, philosophers differ in their intuitions about the scenario.

Other philosophical uses of imagined scenarios arguably are thought experiments also. In one use of scenarios, philosophers might imagine persons in a particular situation (maybe ourselves), and ask what they would do.

For example, in the veil of ignorance, John Rawls asks us to imagine a group of persons in a situation where they know nothing about themselves, and are charged with devising a social or political organization. The use of the state of nature to imagine the origins of government, as by Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, may also be considered a thought experiment. Søren Kierkegaard explored the possible ethical and religious implications of Abraham&#x27;s binding of Isaac in &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot;. Similarly, Friedrich Nietzsche, in &quot;On the Genealogy of Morals&quot;, speculated about the historical development of Judeo-Christian morality, with the intent of questioning its legitimacy.

An early written thought experiment was Plato&#x27;s allegory of the cave. Another historic thought experiment was Avicenna&#x27;s &quot;Floating Man&quot; thought experiment in the 11th century. He asked his readers to imagine themselves suspended in the air isolated from all in order to demonstrate human self-awareness and self-consciousness, and the substantiality of the soul.

===Science===
Scientists tend to use thought experiments as imaginary, &quot;proxy&quot; experiments prior to a real, &quot;physical&quot; experiment (Ernst Mach always argued that these gedankenexperiments were &quot;a necessary precondition for physical experiment&quot;). In these cases, the result of the &quot;proxy&quot; experiment will often be so clear that there will be no need to conduct a physical experiment at all.

Scientists also use thought experiments when particular physical experiments are impossible to conduct (Carl Gustav Hempel labeled these sorts of experiment &quot;theoretical experiments-in-imagination&quot;), such as Einstein&#x27;s thought experiment of chasing a light beam, leading to special relativity. This is a unique use of a scientific thought experiment, in that it was never carried out, but led to a successful theory, proven by other empirical means.

==Properties==
Further categorization of thought experiments can be attributed to specific properties.

===Possibility===
In many thought experiments, the scenario would be nomologically possible, or possible according to the laws of nature. John Searle&#x27;s Chinese room is nomologically possible.

Some thought experiments present scenarios that are not nomologically possible. In his Twin Earth thought experiment, Hilary Putnam asks us to imagine a scenario in which there is a substance with all of the observable properties of water (e.g., taste, color, boiling point), but is chemically different from water. It has been argued that this thought experiment is not nomologically possible, although it may be possible in some other sense, such as metaphysical possibility. It is debatable whether the nomological impossibility of a thought experiment renders intuitions about it moot.

In some cases, the hypothetical scenario might be considered metaphysically impossible, or impossible in any sense at all. David Chalmers says that we can imagine that there are zombies, or persons who are physically identical to us in every way but who lack consciousness. This is supposed to show that physicalism is false. However, some argue that zombies are inconceivable: we can no more imagine a zombie than we can imagine that 1+1=3. Others have claimed that the conceivability of a scenario may not entail its possibility.

===Causal reasoning===
The first characteristic pattern that thought experiments display is their orientation
in time. They are either:

*&quot;Antefactual speculations&quot;: experiments that speculate about what might have happened prior to a specific, designated event, or
*&quot;Postfactual speculations&quot;: experiments that speculate about what may happen subsequent to (or consequent upon) a specific, designated event.

The second characteristic pattern is their movement in time in relation to &quot;the present
moment standpoint&quot; of the individual performing the experiment; namely, in terms of:

* Their &quot;temporal direction&quot;: are they past-oriented or future-oriented?
* Their &quot;temporal sense&quot;:
** (a) in the case of past-oriented thought experiments, are they examining the consequences of temporal &quot;movement&quot; from the present to the past, or from the past to the present? or,
** (b) in the case of future-oriented thought experiments, are they examining the consequences of temporal &quot;movement&quot; from the present to the future, or from the future to the present?

===Relation to real experiments===
The relation to real experiments can be quite complex, as can be seen again from an example going back to Albert Einstein. In 1935, with two coworkers, he published a paper on a newly created subject called later the EPR effect (EPR paradox). In this paper, starting from certain philosophical assumptions, on the basis of a rigorous analysis of a certain, complicated, but in the meantime assertedly realizable model, he came to the conclusion that &quot;quantum mechanics should be described as &quot;incomplete&quot;&quot;. Niels Bohr asserted a refutation of Einstein&#x27;s analysis immediately, and his view prevailed. After some decades, it was asserted that feasible experiments could prove the error of the EPR paper. These experiments tested the Bell inequalities published in 1964 in a purely theoretical paper. The above-mentioned EPR philosophical starting assumptions were considered to be falsified by the empirical fact (e.g. by the optical &quot;real experiments&quot; of Alain Aspect).

Thus &quot;thought experiments&quot; belong to a theoretical discipline, usually to theoretical physics, but often to theoretical philosophy. In any case, it must be distinguished from a real experiment, which belongs naturally to the experimental discipline and has &quot;the final decision on &quot;true&quot; or &quot;not true&quot;&quot;, at least in physics.

===Interactivity===
Thought experiments can also be interactive where the author invites people into his thought process through providing alternative paths with alternative outcomes within the narrative, or through interaction with a programmed machine, like a computer program.

Thanks to the advent of the Internet, the digital space has lent itself as a new medium for a new kind of thought experiments. The philosophical work of Stefano Gualeni, for example, focuses on the use of virtual worlds to materialize thought experiments and to playfully negotiate philosophical ideas. His arguments were originally presented in his 2015 book &quot;Virtual Worlds as Philosophical Tools&quot;.

Gualeni&#x27;s argument is that the history of philosophy has, until recently, merely been the history of written thought, and digital media can complement and enrich the limited and almost exclusively linguistic approach to philosophical thought. He considers virtual worlds (like those interactively encountered in videogames) to be philosophically viable and advantageous. This is especially the case in thought experiments, when the recipients of a certain philosophical notion or perspective are expected to objectively test and evaluate different possible courses of action, or in cases where they are confronted with interrogatives concerning non-actual or non-human phenomenologies.

<doc id="49544" wikidata="Q130852" url="?curid=49544" title="Junichiro Koizumi">
<text>Junichiro Koizumi ( ; , &quot;Koizumi Jun&#x27;ichirō&quot; ; born 8 January 1942) is a Japanese retired politician who served as Prime Minister of Japan and president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) from 2001 to 2006. He retired from politics in 2009. He is the sixth-longest serving Prime Minister in Japanese history.

Widely seen as a maverick leader of the LDP upon his election to the position in 2001, Koizumi became known as a neoliberal economic reformer, focusing on reducing Japan&#x27;s government debt and the privatisation of its postal service. In the 2005 election, Koizumi led the LDP to win one of the largest parliamentary majorities in modern Japanese history. Koizumi also attracted international attention through his deployment of the Japan Self-Defense Forces to Iraq, and through his visits to the Yasukuni Shrine that fueled diplomatic tensions with neighbouring China and South Korea. Koizumi resigned as prime minister in 2006.

Although Koizumi maintained a low profile for several years after he left office, he returned to national attention in 2013 as an advocate for abandoning nuclear power in Japan, in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, which contrasted with the pro-nuclear views espoused by the LDP governments both during and after Koizumi&#x27;s term in office.

==Early life==
Koizumi is a third-generation politician of the Koizumi family. His father, Jun&#x27;ya Koizumi, was director general of the Japan Defense Agency and a member of the House of Representatives. His grandfather, Koizumi Matajirō, called &quot;Tattoo Minister&quot; because of a large tattoo on his body, was Minister of Posts and Telecommunications under Prime Ministers Hamaguchi and Wakatsuki and an early advocate of postal privatization.

Born in Yokosuka, Kanagawa on 8 January 1942, Koizumi was educated at Yokosuka High School. He graduated with a Bachelor of Economics degree from Keio University. He attended University College London before returning to Japan in August 1969 upon the death of his father.

He stood for election to the lower house in December; however, he did not earn enough votes to win election as a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) representative. In 1970, he was hired as a secretary to Takeo Fukuda, who was Minister of Finance at the time and was elected as prime minister in 1976.

In the general elections of December 1972, Koizumi was elected as a member of the Lower House for Kanagawa&#x27;s 2nd district, a seat previously held by his father. He joined Fukuda&#x27;s faction within the LDP. Since then, he has been re-elected ten times.

==Member of House of Representatives==

Koizumi gained his first senior post in 1979 as Parliamentary Vice Minister of Finance, and his first ministerial post in 1988 as Minister of Health and Welfare under Prime Ministers Noboru Takeshita and Sōsuke Uno. He held cabinet posts again in 1992 (Minister of Posts and Telecommunications in the Miyazawa cabinet) and 1996–1998 (Minister of Health and Welfare in the Hashimoto cabinets).

In 1994, with the LDP in opposition, Koizumi became part of a new LDP faction, Shinseiki, made up of younger and more motivated parliamentarians led by Taku Yamasaki, Koichi Kato and Koizumi, a group popularly dubbed &quot;YKK&quot; after the zipper manufacturer YKK.

After Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa resigned in 1994 and the LDP returned to power in a coalition government, Koizumi and Hosokawa teamed up with Shusei Tanaka of New Party Sakigake in a strategic dialogue across party lines regarding Japan becoming a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Although this idea was not popular within the LDP and never came to fruition, Koizumi and Hosokawa maintained a close working relationship across party lines, with Hosokawa tacitly serving as Koizumi&#x27;s personal envoy to China during times of strained Sino-Japanese relations.

Koizumi competed for the presidency of the LDP in September 1995 and July 1998, but he gained little support losing decisively to Ryutaro Hashimoto and then Keizō Obuchi, both of whom had broader bases of support within the party. However, after Yamasaki and Kato were humiliated in a disastrous attempt to force a vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Yoshirō Mori in 2000, Koizumi became the last remaining credible member of the YKK trio, which gave him leverage over the reform-minded wing of the party.

On 24 April 2001, Koizumi was elected president of the LDP. He was initially considered an outside candidate against Hashimoto, who was running for his second term as prime minister. However, in the first poll of prefectural party organizations, Koizumi won 87 to 11 percent; in the second vote of Diet members, Koizumi won 51 to 40 percent. He defeated Hashimoto by a final tally of 298 to 155 votes. He was made Prime Minister of Japan on 26 April, and his coalition secured 78 of 121 seats in the Upper House elections in July.

===Domestic policy===

Within Japan, Koizumi pushed for new ways to revitalise the moribund economy, aiming to act against bad debts with commercial banks, privatize the postal savings system, and reorganize the factional structure of the LDP. He spoke of the need for a period of painful restructuring in order to improve the future. To design policy initiatives in 2001 he used the new Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy (Keizai Zaisei Seisaku Tanto Daijin) or CEFP. It issued an annual planning document, &quot;Basic Policies for Economic and Fiscal Management and Reform&quot;. It planned a major reorganization of the central government, and shaped economic policy in cooperation with key cabinet members. To meet the challenge of economic stagnation CEFP took an integrated approach, a worldwide economic view, and, promoted greater transparency; its philosophy was neoliberal.

In the fall of 2002, Koizumi appointed Keio University economist and frequent television commentator Heizō Takenaka as Minister of State for Financial Services and head of the Financial Services Agency (FSA) to fix the country&#x27;s banking crisis. Bad debts of banks were dramatically cut with the NPL ratio of major banks approaching half the level of 2001. The Japanese economy has been through a slow but steady recovery, and the stock market has dramatically rebounded. The GDP growth for 2004 was one of the highest among G7 nations, according to the International Monetary Fund and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Takenaka was appointed as a Postal Reform Minister in 2004 for the privatization of Japan Post, operator of the country&#x27;s Postal Savings system.

Koizumi moved the LDP away from its traditional rural agrarian base toward a more urban, neoliberal core, as Japan&#x27;s population grew in major cities and declined in less populated areas, although under current purely geographical districting, rural votes in Japan are still many times more powerful than urban ones. In addition to the privatization of Japan Post (which many rural residents fear will reduce their access to basic services such as banking), Koizumi also slowed down the LDP&#x27;s heavy subsidies for infrastructure and industrial development in rural areas. These tensions made Koizumi a controversial but popular figure within his own party and among the Japanese electorate. Considering both his neoliberal policies and his appeal to populist ideas, Koizumi&#x27;s political ideology has been characterized &quot;as a populist version of neoliberalism (or as a variant of the populist right) rather than neoliberal populism.&quot;

===Foreign policy===

Although Koizumi&#x27;s foreign policy was focused on closer relations with the United States and UN-centered diplomacy, which were adopted by all of his predecessors, he went further, supporting the US policies in the War on Terrorism. He decided to deploy the Japan Self-Defense Forces to Iraq, which was the first military mission in active foreign war zones since the end of the World War II. Many Japanese commentators indicated that the favorable US-Japan relation was based on the Koizumi&#x27;s personal friendship with the US President George W. Bush. White House officials described the first meeting between Koizumi and Bush at Camp David as &quot;incredibly warm&quot;, with the two men playing catch with a baseball. Since leaving office, he has defended his decision to send Japanese troops to Iraq. In the North Korean abductions and nuclear development issues, Koizumi took more assertive attitudes than his predecessors.

====Self-Defense Forces policy====
Although Koizumi did not initially campaign on the issue of defense reform, he approved the expansion of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) and in October 2001 they were given greater scope to operate outside of the country. Some of these troops were dispatched to Iraq. Koizumi&#x27;s government also introduced a bill to upgrade the Defense Agency to ministry status; finally, the Defense Agency became the Japanese Ministry of Defense on 9 January 2007.
====Visits to Yasukuni Shrine====
Koizumi has often been noted for his controversial visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, starting on 13 August 2001. He visited the shrine six times as prime minister. Because the shrine honors Japan&#x27;s war dead, which also include many convicted Japanese war criminals and 14 executed Class A war criminals, these visits drew strong condemnation and protests from both Japan&#x27;s neighbours, mainly China and South Korea, and many Japanese citizens. China and South Korea&#x27;s people hold bitter memories of Japanese invasion and occupation during the first half of the 20th century. China and South Korea refused to have their representatives meet Koizumi in Japan and their countries. There were no mutual visits between Chinese and Japanese leaders from October 2001, and between South Korean and Japanese leaders from June 2005. The standstill ended when the next prime minister Abe visited China and South Korea in October 2006.

In China, the visits contributed to widespread anti-Japanese riots, which were also accompanied by other more peaceful large anti-Japan demonstrations across East Asia. The president, ruling and opposition parties, and much of the media of South Korea openly condemned Koizumi&#x27;s pilgrimages. Many Koreans applauded the president&#x27;s speeches criticizing Japan, despite the South Korean President&#x27;s low popularity. When asked about the reaction, Koizumi said the speeches were &quot;for the domestic (audience)&quot;.
Although Koizumi signed the shrine&#x27;s visitor book as &quot;Junichiro Koizumi, the Prime Minister of Japan&quot;, he claimed that his visits were as a private citizen and not an endorsement of any political stance. China and Korea considered this excuse insufficient. Several journals and news reports in Japan, such as one published by Kyodo News Agency on 15 August 2006, questioned Koizumi&#x27;s statement of private purpose, as he unreservedly recorded his position on the shrine&#x27;s guestbook as prime minister. He visited the shrine annually in fulfillment of a campaign pledge. Koizumi&#x27;s last visit as prime minister was on 15 August 2006, fulfilling a campaign pledge to visit on the anniversary of Japan&#x27;s surrender in World War II.

Eleven months after his resignation as prime minister, Koizumi revisited the shrine on 15 August 2007 to mark the 62nd anniversary of Japan&#x27;s surrender in World War II. His 2007 visit attracted less attention from the media than his prior visits while he was in office.

====Statements on World War II====
On 15 August 2005, the sixtieth anniversary of the end of World War II, Koizumi publicly stated that &quot;I would like to express keen remorse and heartfelt apologies&quot; and vowed Japan would never again take &quot;the path to war&quot;.

===Popularity===

Koizumi was an extremely popular leader at certain points in his tenure. His outspoken nature and colourful past contributed to that, and his nicknames included &quot;Lionheart&quot; and &quot;Maverick&quot;. During his time in office, the Japanese public referred to him as &quot;Jun-chan&quot; (the suffix &quot;chan&quot; in the Japanese language is used as a term of familiarity, typically between children, &quot;Jun&quot; is a contraction of Junichiro). In June 2001, he enjoyed an approval rating of 80 percent.

In January 2002, Koizumi fired his Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka, replacing her with Yoriko Kawaguchi. Tanaka had enjoyed high public approval ratings. A few days before her dismissal, when she was filmed crying after a dispute with government officials, Koizumi generated controversy with his statement &quot;tears are women&#x27;s ultimate weapons&quot;. Following an economic slump and a series of LDP scandals that claimed the career of YKK member Koichi Kato, by April Koizumi&#x27;s popularity rating had fallen 30 percentage points since his nomination as prime minister.

Koizumi was re-elected in 2003 and his popularity surged as the economy recovered. His proposal to cut pension benefits as a move to fiscal reform turned out to be highly unpopular. Two visits to North Korea to solve the issue of abducted Japanese nationals only somewhat raised his popularity, as he could not secure several abductees&#x27; returns to Japan. In the House of Councilors elections in 2004, the LDP performed only marginally better than the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), winning 32 more seats than the latter obtained.

In 2005, the House of Councilors rejected the contentious postal privatization bills. Koizumi previously made it clear that he would dissolve the lower house if the bill failed to pass. The Democratic Party, while expressing support for the privatization, made a tactical vote against the bill. Fifty-one LDP members also either voted against the bills or abstained.

On 8 August 2005, Koizumi, as promised, dissolved the House of Representatives and called for snap elections. He expelled rebel LDP members for not supporting the bill. The LDP&#x27;s chances for success were initially uncertain; the secretary general of New Komeito (a junior coalition partner with Koizumi&#x27;s Liberal Democratic Party) said that his party would entertain forming a coalition government with the Democratic Party of Japan if the DPJ took a majority in the House of Representatives.

Koizumi&#x27;s popularity rose almost twenty points after he dissolved the House and expelled rebel LDP members. Opinion polls ranked the government&#x27;s approval ratings between 58 and 65 percent. The electorate saw the election in terms of a vote for or against reform of the postal service, which the Democratic Party and rebel LDP members were seen as being against.

The September 2005 elections were the LDP&#x27;s largest victory since 1986, giving the party a large majority in the House of Representatives and nullifying opposing voices in the House of Councilors. In the following Diet session, the last to be held under Koizumi&#x27;s government, the LDP passed 82 of its 91 proposed bills, including postal privatization. A number of Koizumi-supported candidates known as &quot;Koizumi Children&quot; joined the Diet in this election and supported successive LDP governments until the 2009 elections, when most were defeated.

==Retirement==
Koizumi announced that he would step down from office in 2006, per LDP rules, and would not personally choose a successor as many LDP prime ministers have in the past. On 20 September 2006, Shinzo Abe was elected to succeed Koizumi as president of the LDP. Abe succeeded Koizumi as prime minister on 26 September 2006.

Koizumi remained in the Diet through the administrations of Abe and Yasuo Fukuda, but announced his retirement from politics on 25 September 2008, shortly following the election of Taro Aso as prime minister. He retained his Diet seat until the next general election, when his son Shinjiro was elected into the same seat representing the Kanagawa 11th district in 2009. Koizumi supported Yuriko Koike in the LDP leadership election held earlier in September 2008, but Koike placed a distant third.

Since leaving office as prime minister, Koizumi has not granted a single request for an interview or television appearance, although he has given speeches and had private interactions with journalists.

==Anti-nuclear advocacy==
Koizumi returned to the national spotlight in October 2013, after seven years of largely avoiding attention, when he gave a speech to business executives in Nagoya in which he stated: &quot;We should aim to be nuclear-free... If the Liberal Democratic Party were to adopt a zero-nuclear policy, then we&#x27;d see a groundswell of support for getting rid of nuclear energy.&quot; He recalled Japan&#x27;s reconstruction in the wake of World War II and called for the country to &quot;unite toward a dream of achieving a society based on renewable energy.&quot;

Koizumi had been a proponent of nuclear power throughout his term as prime minister, and was one of the first pro-nuclear politicians to change his stance on the issue in the wake of the Fukushima disaster of 2011. His dramatic remarks were widely covered in the Japanese media, with some tabloids speculating that he may break away from the LDP to form a new party with his son Shinjiro. Economy Minister Akira Amari characterized Koizumi&#x27;s stance as pure but simplistic, while other LDP administration officials downplayed the potential impact of Koizumi&#x27;s views. Former prime minister Naoto Kan, however, expressed hope that Koizumi&#x27;s status as then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe&#x27;s &quot;boss&quot; would help put pressure on the government to minimize or eliminate nuclear power in Japan.

Koizumi defended his change of stance, stating in November that &quot;it is overly optimistic and much more irresponsible to think nuclear power plants can be maintained just with the completion of disposal facilities... We had failed to secure sites for final disposal even before an accident occurred,&quot; concluding that &quot;it&#x27;s better to spend money on developing natural energy resources—citizens are more likely to agree with that idea—than using such large amounts of expenses and energy to advance such a feckless project [as nuclear power].&quot; He explained that in August, he had visited a nuclear waste disposal facility in Finland, where he learned that nuclear waste would have to be sealed up for 100,000 years. A poll by the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; in November 2013 found that 54% of the public supported Koizumi&#x27;s anti-nuclear statements. Koizumi told one reporter that he felt lied to by the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan, which characterized nuclear power as a safe alternative to fossil fuels, stating that &quot;we certainly had no idea how difficult it is to control nuclear energy.&quot;

Koizumi reportedly approached Morihiro Hosokawa, who served as prime minister in an anti-LDP coalition cabinet in the 1990s, to run for Governor of Tokyo in the February 2014 gubernatorial election on the platform of opposing the Abe government&#x27;s pro-nuclear policy.
Hosokawa ran in the election with Koizumi&#x27;s support, but lost to the LDP-supported candidate Yōichi Masuzoe. Koizumi and Hosokawa continued their collaboration in the wake of this defeat, organizing an anti-nuclear forum to be held in May 2014.

Koizumi traveled to the United States in 2016 in support of a lawsuit by Operation Tomodachi participants who claimed illness from radiation exposure caused by the Fukushima disaster.

==Personal life==
Koizumi lives in Yokosuka, Kanagawa.

===Family===
Koizumi married 21-year-old university student Kayoko Miyamoto in 1978. The couple had been formally introduced to each other as potential spouses, a common practice known as &quot;omiai&quot;. The wedding ceremony at the Tokyo Prince Hotel was attended by about 2,500 people, including Takeo Fukuda (then Prime Minister), and featured a wedding cake shaped like the National Diet Building. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982, as Kayoko was reportedly unhappy with her married life for several reasons. After this divorce, Koizumi never married again, saying that divorce consumed ten times more energy than marriage.

Koizumi had custody of two of his three sons: Kōtarō Koizumi and Shinjirō Koizumi, who were reared by one of his sisters. Shinjiro is the representative for Kanagawa&#x27;s 11th district, a position his father has also filled, while Kotaro is an actor. The youngest son, Yoshinaga Miyamoto, now a graduate of Keio University, was born following the divorce and did not meet Koizumi for many years. Yoshinaga is known to have attended one of Koizumi&#x27;s rallies, but was turned away from trying to meet his father. He was also turned away from attending his paternal grandmother&#x27;s funeral. Koizumi&#x27;s ex-wife Kayoko Miyamoto also asked unsuccessfully several times to meet their two eldest sons. Yoshinaga met his father and brothers for the first time in 2010, at a meeting arranged by Shinjiro. Koizumi and his two elder sons also attended Yoshinaga&#x27;s wedding in 2013.

Koizumi is known to have a cousin in Brazil, and was overwhelmed to the point of tears when he visited Brazil in 2004 and was met by a group of Japanese immigrants.

===Interests===

Koizumi is a fan of German composer Richard Wagner and has released a CD of his favorite pieces by contemporary Italian composer Ennio Morricone. He is also a fan of the heavy metal band X Japan, with the LDP having even used their song &quot;Forever Love&quot; in television commercials in 2001. It was also reported that he was influential in getting the museum honoring X Japan&#x27;s deceased guitarist Hide made.

Koizumi is also a noted fan of Elvis Presley, with whom he shares a birthday (8 January). In 2001, he released a collection of his favorite Presley songs on CD, with his comments about each song. His brother is Senior Advisor of the Tokyo Elvis Presley Fan Club. Koizumi and his brother helped finance a statue of Presley in Tokyo&#x27;s Harajuku district. On 30 June 2006, Koizumi visited Presley&#x27;s estate, Graceland, accompanied by U.S. President George W. Bush, and First Lady Laura Bush. After arriving in Memphis aboard Air Force One, they headed to Graceland. While there, Koizumi briefly sang a few bars of his favourite Presley tunes, whilst warmly impersonating Presley, and wearing Presley&#x27;s trademark oversized golden sunglasses.

Koizumi is also a fan of Finnish composer Jean Sibelius. On 8 September 2006, he and Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen visited the Sibelius&#x27; home, where Koizumi showed respect to the late composer with a moment of silence. He owns reproductions of the manuscripts of all seven symphonies by Sibelius.

In 2009, Koizumi made a voice acting appearance in an Ultra Series feature film, &quot;Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy Legend The Movie&quot;, playing the voice of Ultraman King. Koizumi said he took on the role at the urging of his son Shinjiro. His political career is parodied in a seinen manga, &quot;Mudazumo Naki Kaikaku&quot;, which re-interprets his life as a mahjong master.

He has been compared many times to American actor Richard Gere, because of their similar hair style. In 2005, he used the latter as a boost for his falling popularity, by staging an &quot;impromptu ballroom dance performance&quot;.

==Koizumi cabinets==
Notes:
# Makiko Tanaka was fired on 29 January 2002. Koizumi served as interim foreign minister until 1 February, when he appointed then-environment minister Yoriko Kawaguchi to the post. Koizumi appointed Hiroshi Oki to replace Kawaguchi.
# Oshima resigned on 31 March 2003, due to a farm-subsidy scandal. He was replaced by Kamei, who was kept in the next reshuffle.
# Takenaka has also held the portfolio of Minister of State for Postal Privatization since the first Koizumi cabinet. He is the only person to serve on Koizumi&#x27;s cabinet through all five reshuffles.
# Fukuda resigned on 7 May 2004, and was replaced by Hosoda.

<text>In computing, a hyperlink, or simply a link, is a digital reference to data that the user can follow or be guided to by clicking or tapping. A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document. Hypertext is text with hyperlinks. The text that is linked from is known as anchor text. A software system that is used for viewing and creating hypertext is a &quot;hypertext system&quot;, and to create a hyperlink is &quot;to hyperlink&quot; (or simply &quot;to link&quot;). A user following hyperlinks is said to &quot;navigate&quot; or &quot;browse&quot; the hypertext.

The document containing a hyperlink is known as its source document. For example, in content from Wikipedia or Google Search, many words and terms in the text are hyperlinked to definitions of those terms. Hyperlinks are often used to implement reference mechanisms such as tables of contents, footnotes, bibliographies, indexes, and glossaries.

In some hypertext, hyperlinks can be bidirectional: they can be followed in two directions, so both ends act as anchors and as targets. More complex arrangements exist, such as many-to-many links.

The effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system and may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the World Wide Web most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the document being displayed, but some are marked to cause the target document to open in a new window (or, perhaps, in a new tab). Another possibility is transclusion, for which the link target is a document fragment that replaces the link anchor within the source document. Not only persons browsing the document may follow hyperlinks. These hyperlinks may also be followed automatically by programs. A program that traverses the hypertext, following each hyperlink and gathering all the retrieved documents is known as a Web &quot;spider&quot; or crawler.

==Links==

===Inline links===
An inline link displays remote content without the need for embedding the content. The remote content may be accessed with or without the user following the link.

An inline link may display a modified version of the content; for instance, instead of an image, a thumbnail, low resolution preview, cropped section, or magnified section may be shown. The full content is then usually available on demand, as is the case with print publishing software e.g., with an external link. This allows for smaller file sizes and quicker response to changes when the full linked content is not needed, as is the case when rearranging a page layout.

===Anchor links===
An anchor hyperlink (anchor link) is a link bound to a portion of a document, which is often called a . The fragment is generally a portion of text or a heading, though not necessarily. For instance, it may also be a &quot;hot area&quot; in an image (image map in HTML), a designated, often irregular part of an image.

Fragments are marked with &quot;anchors&quot; (in any of various ways), which is why a link to a fragment is called an anchor link (that is, a link to an anchor). For example, in XML, the element codice_1 provides anchoring capability (as long as the DTD or schema defines it), and in wiki markup, codice_2 is a typical example of implementing it. In word processor apps, anchors can be inserted where desired and may be called &quot;bookmarks&quot;. In URLs, the hash character (#) precedes the name of the anchor for the fragment.

One way to define a hot area in an image is by a list of coordinates that indicate its boundaries. For example, a political map of Africa may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping skins or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive embedding of links in the various skin elements.

Text hyperlink. Hyperlink is embedded into a word or a phrase and makes this text clickable.

Image hyperlink. Hyperlink is embedded into an image and makes this image clickable.

Bookmark hyperlink. Hyperlink is embedded into a text or an image and takes visitors to another part of a web page.

E-mail hyperlink. Hyperlink is embedded into e-mail address and allows visitors to send an e-mail message to this e-mail address.

===Fat links===
A fat link (also known as a &quot;one-to-many&quot; link, an &quot;extended link&quot; or a &quot;multi-tailed link&quot;) is a hyperlink which leads to multiple endpoints; the link is a set-valued function.

==Uses in various technologies==

===HTML===

Tim Berners-Lee saw the possibility of using hyperlinks to link any information to any other information over the Internet. Hyperlinks were therefore integral to the creation of the World Wide Web. Web pages are written in the hypertext mark-up language HTML.

This is what a hyperlink to the home page of the W3C organization could look like in HTML code:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/&quot;&gt;W3C organization website&lt;/a&gt;
This HTML code consists of several tags:
* The hyperlink starts with an anchor opening tag &lt;a, and includes a hyperlink reference href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/&quot; to the URL for the page. (The URL is enclosed in quotes.)
* The URL is followed by &gt;, marking the end of the anchor opening tag.
* The words that follow identify what is being linked; this is the only part of the code that is ordinarily visible on the screen when the page is rendered, but when the cursor hovers over the link, many browsers display the target URL somewhere on the screen, such as in the lower left-hand corner.
* Typically these words are underlined and colored (for example, blue for a link that has not yet been visited and purple for a link already visited).
* The anchor closing tag (&lt;/a&gt;) terminates the hyperlink code.
* The &lt;a&gt; tag can also consist of various attributes such as the &quot;rel&quot; attribute which specifies the relationship between the current document and linked document.

Webgraph is a graph, formed from web pages as vertices and hyperlinks, as directed edges.

===XLink===

The W3C recommendation called XLink describes hyperlinks that offer a far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML. These extended links can be &quot;multidirectional&quot;, remove linking from, within, and between XML documents. It can also describe &quot;simple links&quot;, which are unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality than hyperlinks in HTML.

===Permalinks===

Permalinks are URLs that are intended to remain unchanged for many years into the future, yielding hyperlinks that are less susceptible to link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly URLs, so as to be easy for people to type and remember. Permalinks are used in order to point and redirect readers to the same Web page, blog post or any online digital media.

The scientific literature is a place where link persistence is crucial to the public knowledge. A 2013 study in BMC Bioinformatics analyzed 15,000 links in abstracts from Thomson Reuters&#x27; Web of Science citation index, founding that the median lifespan of Web pages was 9.3 years, and just 62% were archived. The median lifespan of a Web page constitutes high-degree variable, but its order of magnitude usually is of some months.

==How hyperlinks work in HTML==
A link from one domain to another is said to be &quot;outbound&quot; from its source anchor and &quot;inbound&quot; to its target.

The most common destination anchor is a URL used in the World Wide Web. This can refer to a document, e.g. a webpage, or other resource, or to a position in a webpage. The latter is achieved by means of an HTML element with a &quot;name&quot; or &quot;id&quot; attribute at that position of the HTML document. The URL of the position is the URL of the webpage with a fragment identifier &quot;#&quot;id attribute&quot; appended.

When linking to PDF documents from an HTML page the &quot;id attribute&quot;&quot; can be replaced with syntax that references a page number or another element of the PDF, for example, &quot;#&quot;page=386&quot;&quot;.

===Link behavior in web browsers===
A web browser usually displays a hyperlink in some distinguishing way, e.g. in a different color, font or style, or with certain symbols following to visualize link target or document types. This is also called &quot;link decoration&quot;. The behavior and style of links can be specified using the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language.

In a graphical user interface, the appearance of a mouse cursor may change into a hand motif to indicate a link. In most graphical web browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have not been visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the user activates the link (e.g., by clicking on it with the mouse) the browser displays the link&#x27;s target. If the target is not an HTML file, depending on the file type and on the browser and its plugins, another program may be activated to open the file.

The HTML code contains some or all of the five main characteristics of a link:
* link destination (&quot;href&quot; pointing to a URL)
* link label
* link title
* link target
* link class or link id

It uses the HTML element &quot;a&quot; with the attribute &quot;href&quot; (HREF is an abbreviation for &quot;Hypertext REFerence&quot;) and optionally also the attributes &quot;title&quot;, &quot;target&quot;, and &quot;class&quot; or &quot;id&quot;:

:&lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;URL&quot; title=&quot;link title&quot; target=&quot;link target&quot; class=&quot;link class&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;link label&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/samp&gt;

To embed a link into a web page, blogpost, or comment, it may take this form:

:codice_3

In a typical web browser, this would display as the underlined word &quot;Example&quot; in blue, which when clicked would take the user to the example.com website. This contributes to a clean, easy to read text or document.

By default, browsers will usually display hyperlinks as such:
* An unvisited link is usually blue and underlined
* A visited link is usually purple and underlined
* An active link is usually red and underlined

When the cursor hovers over a link, depending on the browser and graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be shown, popping up, not in a regular window, but in a special hover box, which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away and back). Mozilla Firefox, IE, Opera, and many other web browsers all show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the status bar.

Normally, a link opens in the current frame or window, but sites that use frames and multiple windows for navigation can add a special &quot;target&quot; attribute to specify where the link loads. If no window exists with that name, a new window is created with the ID, which can be used to refer to the window later in the browsing session.

Creation of new windows is probably the most common use of the &quot;target&quot; attribute. To prevent accidental reuse of a window, the special window names &quot;_blank&quot; and &quot;_new&quot; are usually available, and always cause a new window to be created. It is especially common to see this type of link when one large website links to an external page. The intention in that case is to ensure that the person browsing is aware that there is no endorsement of the site being linked to by the site that was linked from. However, the attribute is sometimes overused and can sometimes cause many windows to be created even while browsing a single site.

Another special page name is &quot;_top&quot;, which causes any frames in the current window to be cleared away so that browsing can continue in the full window.

==History==

The term &quot;link&quot; was coined in 1965 (or possibly 1964) by Ted Nelson at the start of Project Xanadu. Nelson had been inspired by &quot;As We May Think&quot;, a popular 1945 essay by Vannevar Bush. In the essay, Bush described a microfilm-based machine (the Memex) in which one could link any two pages of information into a &quot;trail&quot; of related information, and then scroll back and forth among pages in a trail as if they were on a single microfilm reel.

In a series of books and articles published from 1964 through 1980, Nelson transposed Bush&#x27;s concept of automated cross-referencing into the computer context, made it applicable to specific text strings rather than whole pages, generalized it from a local desk-sized machine to a theoretical proprietary worldwide computer network, and advocated the creation of such a network. Though Nelson&#x27;s Xanadu Corporation was eventually funded by Autodesk in the 1980s, it never created this proprietary public-access network. Meanwhile, working independently, a team led by Douglas Engelbart (with Jeff Rulifson as chief programmer) was the first to implement the hyperlink concept for scrolling within a single document (1966), and soon after for connecting between paragraphs within separate documents (1968), with NLS. Ben Shneiderman working with graduate student Dan Ostroff designed and implemented the highlighted link in the HyperTIES system in 1983. HyperTIES was used to produce the world&#x27;s first electronic journal, the July 1988 Communications of the ACM, which was cited as the source for the link concept in Tim Berners-Lee&#x27;s Spring 1989 manifesto for the Web. In 1988, Ben Shneiderman and Greg Kearsley used HyperTIES to publish &quot;Hypertext Hands-On!&quot;, the world&#x27;s first electronic book.

Released in 1987 for the Apple Macintosh, the database program HyperCard allowed for hyperlinking between various pages within a document, as well as to other documents and separate applications on the same computer. In 1990, Windows Help, which was introduced with Microsoft Windows 3.0, had widespread use of hyperlinks to link different pages in a single help file together; in addition, it had a visually different kind of hyperlink that caused a popup help message to appear when clicked, usually to give definitions of terms introduced on the help page. The first widely used open protocol that included hyperlinks from any Internet site to any other Internet site was the Gopher protocol from 1991. It was soon eclipsed by HTML after the 1993 release of the Mosaic browser (which could handle Gopher links as well as HTML links). HTML&#x27;s advantage was the ability to mix graphics, text, and hyperlinks, unlike Gopher, which just had menu-structured text and hyperlinks.

==Legal issues==
While hyperlinking among webpages is an intrinsic feature of the web, some websites object to being linked by other websites; some have claimed that linking to them is not allowed without permission.

Contentious in particular are deep links, which do not point to a site&#x27;s home page or other entry point designated by the site owner, but to content elsewhere, allowing the user to bypass the site&#x27;s own designated flow, and &quot;inline links&quot;, which incorporate the content in question into the pages of the linking site, making it seem part of the linking site&#x27;s own content unless an explicit attribution is added.

In certain jurisdictions, it is or has been held that hyperlinks are not merely references or citations, but are devices for copying web pages. In the Netherlands, Karin Spaink was initially convicted in this way of copyright infringement by linking, although this ruling was overturned in 2003. The courts that advocate this view see the mere publication of a hyperlink that connects to illegal material to be an illegal act in itself, regardless of whether referencing illegal material is illegal. In 2004, Josephine Ho was acquitted of &#x27;hyperlinks that corrupt traditional values&#x27; in Taiwan.

In 2000, British Telecom sued Prodigy, claiming that Prodigy infringed its patent () on web hyperlinks. After litigation, a court found for Prodigy, ruling that British Telecom&#x27;s patent did not cover web hyperlinks.

In United States &quot;jurisprudence&quot;, there is a distinction between the mere act of linking to someone else&#x27;s website, and linking to content that is illegal (e.g., gambling illegal in the US) or infringing (e.g., illegal MP3 copies). Several courts have found that merely linking to someone else&#x27;s website, even if by bypassing commercial advertising, is not copyright or trademark infringement, regardless of how much someone else might object. Linking to illegal or infringing content can be sufficiently problematic to give rise to legal liability. Compare for a summary of the current status of US copyright law as to hyperlinking, see the discussion regarding the &quot;Arriba Soft&quot; and &quot;Perfect 10&quot; cases.

Somewhat controversially, Vuestar Technologies has tried to enforce patents applied for by its owner, Ronald Neville Langford, around the world relating to search techniques using hyperlinked images to other websites or web pages.

<doc id="49549" wikidata="Q159048" url="?curid=49549" title="Katsura Tarō">
<text>Prince was a Japanese politician and general who served as prime minister of Japan from 1901 to 1906, from 1908 to 1911, and from 1912 to 1913. He was a &quot;genrō&quot;, or senior statesman who helped dictate policy during the Meiji era, and is the second-longest serving Japanese prime minister after Shinzo Abe, serving for a combined total of 7 years and 330 days.

Born in the Choshu Domain to a samurai family, Katsura participated in the Boshin War that led to the Meiji Restoration in 1868. He spent several years studying military science in Germany, and became a protégé of Yamagata Aritomo. He distinguished himself in the First Sino-Japanese War, then served as governor-general of Taiwan and later as minister of war from 1898 to 1901, when he was appointed prime minister. Katsura&#x27;s relatively stable tenure saw Japan&#x27;s victory in the Russo-Japanese War before he was forced to resign in 1906 amid public outrage at the government&#x27;s failure to secure an indemnity from Russia. He returned as premier in 1908, and showed authoritarian tendencies in the crackdown on the High Treason Incident of 1910, which saw the mass arrest of leftists and which was followed by the establishment of the Special Higher Police in 1911. After Emperor Meiji&#x27;s death in 1912, Katsura became prime minister again, which triggered the Taisho Political Crisis. He resigned three months later after a vote of no confidence.

==Early life==
Katsura was born on 4 January 1848 in Hagi, Nagato Province (present-day Yamaguchi Prefecture) as the eldest son of horse guard Katsura Yoichiemon into a samurai family of the Chōshū Domain. As a youth, Katsura joined the movement against the Tokugawa shogunate and participated in the Boshin War that led to the Meiji Restoration in 1868.

==Army career==

The new Meiji government considered that Katsura displayed great talent, and in 1870 sent him to Germany to study military science. He served as military attaché at the Japanese embassy in Germany from 1875 to 1878 and again from 1884 to 1885. On his return to Japan, he was promoted to major general. He served in several key positions within the Imperial Japanese Army, and in 1886 was appointed Vice-Minister of War.

During the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) Katsura commanded the IJA 3rd Division under his mentor, Field Marshal Yamagata Aritomo. During the war, his division made a memorable march in the depth of winter from the north-east shore of the Yellow Sea to Haicheng, finally occupying Niuchwang, and effecting a junction with the IJA 2nd Army which had moved up the Liaodong Peninsula.

After the war, he was elevated with the title of &quot;shishaku&quot; (viscount) under the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage system. He was appointed 2nd Governor-General of Taiwan from 2 June 1896, to October 1896.

In successive cabinets from 1898 to 1901, he served as Minister of War.

==Prime minister==

Katsura Tarō served as the 11th, 13th and 15th prime minister of Japan. His position as the longest-serving prime minister of Japan (total length) was surpassed by Shinzō Abe on 20 November 2019.

===First administration===
Katsura became prime minister for the first time on 2 June 1901, and he retained the office for four and a half years to 7 January 1906, which was then a record in Japan. Japan emerged as a major imperialist power in East Asia. In terms of foreign affairs, it was marked by the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902 and victory over the Russian Empire in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. During his first premiership, the Taft–Katsura agreement, accepting Japanese hegemony over Korea, was reached with the United States. Katsura received the Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George from King Edward VII of the United Kingdom and was elevated to the rank of marquess by Emperor Meiji.

In terms of domestic policy, Katsura was a strictly conservative politician who attempted to distance himself from the Imperial Diet and party politics. His political views mirrored that of former prime minister Yamagata Aritomo in that he viewed that his sole responsibility was to the Emperor. He vied for control of the government with the &quot;Rikken Seiyūkai&quot;, the majority party of the lower house, headed by his archrival, Marquess Saionji Kinmochi.

In January 1906, Katsura resigned the premiership to Saionji Kinmochi over the unpopular Treaty of Portsmouth (1905), ending the war between Japan and Russia. However, his resignation was part of a &quot;back door deal,&quot; brokered by Hara Takashi to alternate power between Saionji and Hara.

On 1 April 1906, he was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum.

===Second administration===

Katsura returned as prime minister from 14 July 1908, to 30 August 1911. His second premiership was noteworthy for the Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty of 1910 to colonize Korea. He also promulgated the Factory Act in 1911, the first act for the purpose of labor protection in Japan.

Katsura was increasingly unpopular during his second premiership over public perception that he was using his office to further both his personal fortune and the interests of the military &quot;(gunbatsu)&quot; over the welfare of the people. He also faced growing public dissatisfaction over the persistence of the &quot;hanbatsu&quot; domainal based politics.

After his resignation, he became a &quot;kōshaku&quot; (公爵 = prince), Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan and one of the &quot;genrō.&quot;

===Third administration===
Katsura&#x27;s brief reappointment as prime minister third time from 21 December 1912, to 20 February 1913, sparked widespread riots in what became known as the Taisho Political Crisis. His appointment was viewed as a plot by the &quot;genrō&quot; to overthrow the Meiji Constitution. However, rather than compromising, Katsura created his own political party, the &quot;Rikken Dōshikai&quot; (Constitutional Association of Allies) in an effort to establish his own support base after his third premiership. 

However, faced with a no-confidence motion, the first successful one in Japanese history, and the loss of the support of his backers, he was forced to resign in February 1913. He was succeeded by Yamamoto Gonnohyōe.

==Death==
Katsura died of stomach cancer eight months later on 10 October 1913, aged 65. His funeral was held at the temple of Zōjō-ji in Shiba, Tokyo and his grave is at the Shōin Jinja, in Setagaya.

<text>Rugby School is a private boarding school for pupils aged 13–18, located in town of Rugby, Warwickshire in England.

Founded in 1567 as a free grammar school for local boys, it is one of the oldest independent schools in Britain. Up to 1667, the school remained in comparative obscurity. Its re-establishment by Thomas Arnold during his time as Headmaster, from 1828 to 1841, was seen as the forerunner of the Victorian public school. It was one of nine schools investigated by the Clarendon Commission of 1864 and later regulated as one of the seven schools included in the Public Schools Act 1868. Originally a boys&#x27; school, it became fully co-educational in 1992.

The school&#x27;s alumni – or &quot;Old Rugbeians&quot; – include a UK prime minister, a French prime minister, several bishops, poets, scientists, writers and soldiers.

Rugby School is the birthplace of rugby football.

== History ==

===Foundation and early growth===
Rugby School was founded in 1567 as a provision in the will of Lawrence Sheriff, who had made his fortune supplying groceries to Queen Elizabeth I of England. In the last few months of his life, Sheriff had drawn up a will which stipulated that his fortune should be used to found almshouses and a free grammar school &quot;to serve chiefly for the children of Rugby and Brownsover... and next for such as be of other places hereunto adjoyneing.&quot;. Shortly before his death, Sheriff added a codicil to his will reducing the amount of money he left to the school, possibly due to a family financial problem, but instead leaving his eight acre Conduit Close estate in Middlesex: At the time this seemed like a poor exchange, as the estate consisted of undeveloped farmland on the edge of London, however, in time this endowment made Rugby School a wealthy institution due to the subsequent development of the area and rise in land values. The area of what is now the Rugby Estate includes much of what is now Great Ormond Street, Lamb&#x27;s Conduit Street and Rugby Street in the London district of Bloomsbury.

Up to 1667, the school remained in comparative obscurity. Sheriff&#x27;s endowment was not fully realized for some time, due to a challenge over the provisions of the will from the Howkins family, to whom Sheriff was related through his sister, Bridget. Its history during that trying period is characterised mainly by a series of lawsuits between the Howkins family, who tried to defeat the intentions of the testator, and the masters and trustees, who tried to carry them out. A final decision was handed down in 1667, confirming the findings of a commission in favour of the trust, and henceforth the school maintained a steady growth. Under the headmastership of Henry Holyoake (from 1688 to 1731) the school became more than simply a local concern, and began to take on national importance. By the end of the 17th century, there were pupils from every part of England attending the school.

The school was originally based in a wooden schoolhouse on Church Street opposite St Andrew&#x27;s Church, which incorporated Lawrence Sheriff&#x27;s former house. By the 1740s this building was in poor condition, and the school looked to relocate to new premises. In 1750, the school moved to its current location to the south of the town centre, when it purchased a former Manor House at the south of High Street; this became the Master&#x27;s house, a new schoolhouse was built alongside. The current school buildings date from the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Henry Ingles, who was Headmaster between 1794 and 1806, was known for his strict discipline and gained the nickname &quot;The Black Tiger&quot;. His time as Headmaster is most notable for the &#x27;Great Rebellion&#x27; of 1797: It started when Ingles heard one of the boys shoot a cork gun, and the boy told him that Mr Rowell, a grocer, had supplied the gunpowder. Mr Rowell denied this, and as a result the boy Astley was flogged by Ingles, the boys retaliated by smashing Mr Rowell&#x27;s windows and Ingles insisted that the boys pay for the damage. This provoked a full-scale riot, in which the boys blew off doors, smashed windows and burned furniture and books. As the other Masters were away, Ingles called on help from the townsfolk. A party of recruiting soldiers and some townsfolk advanced on the rioters, who retreated onto a moated island in the school grounds. The Riot Act was read out by a local justice of the peace, calling on the boys to surrender, and while this caused a distraction a group of soldiers waded across the moat from the rear and took the boys prisoner.

===Victorian period===

Rugby School&#x27;s most famous headmaster was Thomas Arnold, from 1828 to 1841, whose emphasis on moral and religious principle, was widely admired and was seen as the blueprint for Victorian public schools. Arnold&#x27;s period as headmaster is immortalised in Thomas Hughes&#x27;s 1857 novel &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot;. In the Victorian period, Rugby School saw several further Headmasters of some distinction, these included Frederick Temple (1858–1869) who would later become the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Percival (1887–1895) after whom the Percival Guildhouse is named, and Herbert Armitage James (1895–1910)

In 1845, a committee of Rugby schoolboys, William Delafield Arnold, W. W. Shirley and Frederick Hutchins, wrote the &quot;Laws of Football as Played At Rugby School&quot;, the first published set of laws for any code of football.

Rugby was one of the nine prestigious schools investigated by the Clarendon Commission of 1861–64 (the schools under scrutiny being Eton, Charterhouse, Harrow, Shrewsbury, Westminster, and Winchester, and two day schools: St Paul&#x27;s and Merchant Taylors). Rugby went on to be included in the Public Schools Act 1868, which ultimately related only to the seven boarding schools.

From the early days of the school the pupils were divided into &quot;Foundationers&quot; i.e. boys who lived in Rugby and surrounding villages who received free schooling, as per Sheriff&#x27;s original bequest, and &quot;Non-Foundationers&quot;, boys from outside the Rugby area who paid fees and were boarders. Non-Foundationers were admitted from the early history of the school as they helped to pay the bills. Gradually, as the school&#x27;s reputation grew, fee-paying Non-Foundationers became dominant and local boys benefited less and less from Sheriff&#x27;s original intentions. By the latter half of the 19th century it was considered no longer desirable to have local boys attending a prestigious public school and so a new school – Lawrence Sheriff Grammar School – was founded in 1878 in order to continue Sheriff&#x27;s original bequest for a free school for local boys.

On several occasions in the late 19th century Rugby School was visited by the French educator Pierre de Coubertin, who would later cite the school as one of the main inspirations for his most notable achievement, the founding of the modern Olympic Games in 1896.

===Modern history===

In 1975 two girls were admitted to the sixth form and the first girls&#x27; house opened three years later, followed by three more. In 1992 the school became fully co-educational when the first 13-year-old girls arrived, and in 1995 Rugby had its first-ever Head Girl, Louise Woolcock, who appeared on the front page of &quot;The Times&quot;. In September 2003 the last girls&#x27; house was added. Today, total enrolment of day pupils, from forms 4 to 12, numbers around 800.

===Branches overseas===

In 2017, Rugby School opened their first ever overseas franchise in Chonburi Province, Thailand, called Rugby School Thailand. In 2023, the school opened another branch in the city of Kashiwa, Chiba Prefecture, Japan, Rugby School Japan.

==Rugby football==
The game of Rugby football owes its name to the school.

The legend of William Webb Ellis and the origin of the game is commemorated by a plaque on the school grounds. The story is that Webb Ellis was the first to pick up a football and run with it, and thus invent a new sport. However, the sole source of the story is Matthew Bloxam, a former pupil but not a contemporary of Webb Ellis. In October 1876, four years after the death of Webb Ellis, in a letter to the school newspaper &quot;The Meteor&quot; he quotes an unknown friend relating the story to him. He elaborated on the story four years later in another letter to &quot;The Meteor&quot;, but shed no further light on its source. Richard Lindon, a boot and shoemaker who had premises across the street from the school&#x27;s main entrance in Lawrence Sheriff Street, is credited with the invention of the &quot;oval&quot; rugby ball, the rubber inflatable bladder and the brass hand pump.

There were no standard rules for football in Webb Ellis&#x27;s time at Rugby (1816–1825) and most varieties involved carrying the ball. The games played at Rugby were organised by the pupils and not the masters, the rules being a matter of custom and not written down. They were frequently changed and modified with each new intake of students.

== Rugby fives ==

Rugby fives is a handball game, similar to squash, played in an enclosed court. It has similarities with Winchester fives (a form of Wessex fives) and Eton fives.

It is most commonly believed to be derived from Wessex fives, a game played by Thomas Arnold, Headmaster of Rugby, who had played Wessex fives when a boy at Lord Weymouth&#x27;s Grammar, now Warminster School. The open court of Wessex fives, built in 1787, is still in existence at Warminster School although it has fallen out of regular use.

Rugby fives is played between two players (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles), the aim being to hit the ball above a &#x27;bar&#x27; across the front wall in such a way that the opposition cannot return it before a second bounce. The ball is slightly larger than a golf ball, leather-coated and hard. Players wear leather padded gloves on both hands, with which they hit the ball.

Rugby fives continues to have a good following with tournaments being run nationwide, presided over by the Rugby Fives Association.

==Cricket==

The school has produced a number of cricketers who have gone onto play Test and first-class cricket. The school has played host to two major matches, the first of which was a Twenty20 match between Warwickshire and Glamorgan in the 2013 Friends Life t20. The second match was a List-A one-day match between Warwickshire and Sussex in the 2015 Royal London One-Day Cup, though it was due to host a match in the 2014 competition, however this was abandoned. In the 2015 match, William Porterfield scored a century, with a score of exactly 100. Warwickshire will return to Rugby School in 2024 to play three matches in the One-Day Cup.

== Houses ==
Rugby School has both day and boarding-pupils, the latter in the majority. Originally it was for boys only, but girls have been admitted to the sixth form since 1975. It went fully co-educational in 1992. The school community is divided into houses.


== Academic life ==
Pupils beginning Rugby in the F Block (first year) study various subjects. In a pupil&#x27;s second year (E block), they do nine subjects which are for their GCSEs, this is the same for the D Block (GCSE year). The school then provides standard A-levels in 29 subjects. Students at this stage have the choice of taking three or four subjects and are also offered the opportunity to take an extended project. The School also offers taking the IB Diploma Programme. Oxbridge acceptance percentage in 2007 was 10.4%. In 2023, 68% of students that took A-levels at Rugby School scored A*/A while 83% of GCSE students scored 9/7.

===Scholarships===
The Governing Body provides financial benefits with school fees to families unable to afford them. Parents of pupils who are given a Scholarship are capable of obtaining a 10% fee deduction, although more than one scholarship can be awarded to one student.

== Fees ==

*Boarder fees per term: £13,970
*Day pupil fees per term: £8,770

==Former pupils ==
There have been a number of notable Old Rugbeians, including the purported father of the sport of Rugby William Webb Ellis, the inventor of Australian rules football, Tom Wills, the war poets Rupert Brooke and John Gillespie Magee, Jr., Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, author and mathematician Lewis Carroll, poet and cultural critic Matthew Arnold, the author and social critic Salman Rushdie (who said of his time there: &quot;Almost the only thing I am proud of about going to Rugby school was that Lewis Carroll went there too.&quot;) and the Irish writer and republican Francis Stuart. The Indian concert pianist, music composer and singer Adnan Sami also studied at Rugby School. Matthew Arnold&#x27;s father Thomas Arnold, was a headmaster of the school. Philip Henry Bahr (later Sir Philip Henry Manson-Bahr), a zoologist and medical doctor, World War I veteran, was President of both Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene and Medical Society of London, and vice-president of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union. Richard Barrett Talbot Kelly joined the army in 1915, straight after leaving the school, earned a Military Cross during the First World War, and later returned to the school as Director of Art.

===Rugbeian Society===
The Rugbeian Society is for former pupils at the school. An Old Rugbeian is sometimes referred to as an OR.

The purposes of the society are to encourage and help Rugbeians in interacting with each other and to strengthen the ties between ORs and the school.

In 2010 the Rugbeians reached the semi-finals of the Public Schools&#x27; Old Boys&#x27; Sevens tournament, hosted by the Old Silhillians to celebrate the 450th anniversary of fellow Warwickshire public school, Solihull School.

==Buildings and architecture==

The buildings of Rugby School date from the 18th and 19th century with some early 20th-century additions. The oldest buildings are the Old Quad Buildings and the School House the oldest parts of which date from 1748, but were mostly built between 1809 and 1813, designed by Henry Hakewill, these are grade II* listed.

Most of the current landmark buildings date from the Victorian era and were designed by William Butterfield: The most notable of these is the chapel, dating from 1872, which is topped by an octagonal tower tall, and is grade I listed. Butterfield&#x27;s New Quad buildings are Grade II* listed and date from 1867 to 1885. The Grade II* War Memorial chapel, designed by Sir Charles Nicholson, dates to 1922. Nicholson was educated at the school from the late-1870s.

The &quot;Temple Speech Room&quot; on Barby Road was named after former Rugby headmaster, Frederick Temple, It was opened on 3 July 1909 by King Edward VII. Designed by Thomas Graham Jackson, it is grade II listed. The Macready Theatre is based in a prominent Victorian building on Lawrence Sheriff Street which was built as classrooms in 1885, in 1975 it was converted into a theatre, in 2018, it was opened to the general public.

===Thomas Arnold===
Rugby&#x27;s most famous headmaster was Thomas Arnold, appointed in 1828; he executed many reforms to the school curriculum and administration. Arnold&#x27;s and the school&#x27;s reputations were immortalised through Thomas Hughes&#x27; book &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days.&quot;

David Newsome writes about the new educational methods employed by Arnold in his book, &#x27;Godliness and Good Learning&#x27; (Cassell 1961). He calls the morality practised at Arnold&#x27;s school muscular Christianity. Arnold had three principles: religious and moral principle, gentlemanly conduct and academic performance. George Mosse, former professor of history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, lectured on Arnold&#x27;s time at Rugby. According to Mosse, Thomas Arnold created an institution which fused religious and moral principles, gentlemanly conduct, and learning based on self-discipline. These morals were socially enforced through the &quot;Gospel of work&quot;. The object of education was to produce &quot;the Christian gentleman&quot;, a man with good outward appearance, playful but earnest, industrious, manly, honest, virginal pure, innocent, and responsible.

===John Percival===

In 1888 the appointment of Marie Bethell Beauclerc by Percival was the first appointment of a female teacher in an English boys&#x27; public school and the first time shorthand had been taught in any such school. The shorthand course was popular with one hundred boys in the classes.

== Controversy ==
In September 2005, the school was one of fifty independent schools operating independent school fee-fixing, in breach of the Competition Act, 1998. All of the schools involved were ordered to abandon this practice, pay a nominal penalty of £10,000 each and to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information had been shared.

The head of the Independent Schools Council declared that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, stating &quot;They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed.&quot;

<text>A batholith () is a large mass of intrusive igneous rock (also called plutonic rock), larger than in area, that forms from cooled magma deep in the Earth&#x27;s crust. Batholiths are almost always made mostly of felsic or intermediate rock types, such as granite, quartz monzonite, or diorite (see also &quot;granite dome&quot;).

==Formation==
Although they may appear uniform, batholiths are in fact structures with complex histories and compositions. They are composed of multiple masses, or &quot;plutons&quot;, bodies of igneous rock of irregular dimensions (typically at least several kilometers) that can be distinguished from adjacent igneous rock by some combination of criteria including age, composition, texture, or mappable structures. Individual plutons are solidified from magma that traveled toward the surface from a zone of partial melting near the base of the Earth&#x27;s crust.

Traditionally, these plutons have been considered to form by ascent of relatively buoyant magma in large masses called &quot;plutonic diapirs&quot;. Because the diapirs are liquified and very hot, they tend to rise through the surrounding native country rock, pushing it aside and partially melting it. Most diapirs do not reach the surface to form volcanoes, but instead they slow down, cool, and usually solidify 5 to 30 kilometers underground as plutons (hence the use of the word &quot;pluton&quot;; in reference to the Roman god of the underworld Pluto). An alternate view is that plutons are formed by aggregation of smaller volumes of magma that ascend as dikes.

A batholith is formed when many plutons converge to form a huge expanse of granitic rock. Some batholiths are mammoth, paralleling past and present subduction zones and other heat sources for hundreds of kilometers in continental crust. One such batholith is the Sierra Nevada Batholith, which is a continuous granitic formation that makes up much of the Sierra Nevada in California. An even larger batholith, the Coast Plutonic Complex, is found predominantly in the Coast Mountains of western Canada; it extends for 1,800 kilometers and reaches into southeastern Alaska.

==Surface expression and erosion==
A batholith is an exposed area of (mostly) continuous plutonic rock that covers an area larger than 100 square kilometers (40 square miles). Areas smaller than 100 square kilometers are called &quot;stocks&quot;. However, the majority of batholiths visible at the surface (via outcroppings) have areas far greater than 100 square kilometers. These areas are exposed to the surface through the process of erosion accelerated by continental uplift acting over many tens of millions to hundreds of millions of years. This process has removed several tens of square kilometers of overlying rock in many areas, exposing the once deeply buried batholiths.

Batholiths exposed at the surface are subjected to huge pressure differences between their former location deep in the earth and their new location at or near the surface. As a result, their crystal structure expands slightly over time. This manifests itself by a form of mass wasting called exfoliation. This form of weathering causes convex and relatively thin sheets of rock to slough off the exposed surfaces of batholiths (a process accelerated by frost wedging). The result is fairly clean and rounded rock faces. A well-known result of this process is Half Dome in Yosemite Valley.

<text>A castle is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders. Scholars usually consider a &quot;castle&quot; to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a mansion, palace, and villa, whose main purpose was exclusively for &quot;pleasance&quot; and are not primarily fortresses but may be fortified. Use of the term has varied over time and, sometimes, has also been applied to structures such as hill forts and 19th- and 20th-century homes built to resemble castles. Over the Middle Ages, when genuine castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls, arrowslits, and portcullises, were commonplace.

European-style castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries after the fall of the Carolingian Empire, which resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes. These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them and they were both offensive and defensive structures: they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as offering protection from enemies. Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies, the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power. Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes, and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community, such as mills, fertile land, or a water source.

Many northern European castles were originally built from earth and timber but had their defences replaced later by stone. Early castles often exploited natural defences, lacking features such as towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep. In the late 12th and early 13th centuries, a scientific approach to castle defence emerged. This led to the proliferation of towers, with an emphasis on flanking fire. Many new castles were polygonal or relied on concentric defence – several stages of defence within each other that could all function at the same time to maximise the castle&#x27;s firepower. These changes in defence have been attributed to a mixture of castle technology from the Crusades, such as concentric fortification, and inspiration from earlier defences, such as Roman forts. Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature, so that devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defence into symbols of power. Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress and dominate their landscape.

Although gunpowder was introduced to Europe in the 14th century, it did not significantly affect castle building until the 15th century, when artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls. While castles continued to be built well into the 16th century, new techniques to deal with improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable and undesirable places to live. As a result, true castles went into a decline and were replaced by artillery star forts with no role in civil administration, and château or country houses that were indefensible. From the 18th century onwards, there was a renewed interest in castles with the construction of mock castles, part of a Romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no military purpose.

==Definition==

===Etymology===
The word &quot;castle&quot; is derived from the Latin word &quot;castellum&quot;, which is a diminutive of the word &quot;castrum&quot;, meaning &quot;fortified place&quot;. The Old English &quot;castel&quot;, Occitan &quot;castel&quot; or &quot;chastel&quot;, French &quot;château&quot;, Spanish &quot;castillo&quot;, Portuguese &quot;castelo&quot;, Italian &quot;castello&quot;, and a number of words in other languages also derive from &quot;castellum&quot;. The word &quot;castle&quot; was introduced into English shortly before the Norman Conquest of 1066 to denote this type of building, which was then new to England.

===Defining characteristics===
In its simplest terms, the definition of a castle accepted amongst academics is &quot;a private fortified residence&quot;. This contrasts with earlier fortifications, such as Anglo-Saxon burhs and walled cities such as Constantinople and Antioch in the Middle East; castles were not communal defences but were built and owned by the local feudal lords, either for themselves or for their monarch. Feudalism was the link between a lord and his vassal where, in return for military service and the expectation of loyalty, the lord would grant the vassal land. In the late 20th century, there was a trend to refine the definition of a castle by including the criterion of feudal ownership, thus tying castles to the medieval period; however, this does not necessarily reflect the terminology used in the medieval period. During the First Crusade (1096–1099), the Frankish armies encountered walled settlements and forts that they indiscriminately referred to as castles, but which would not be considered as such under the modern definition.

Castles served a range of purposes, the most important of which were military, administrative, and domestic. As well as defensive structures, castles were also offensive tools which could be used as a base of operations in enemy territory. Castles were established by Norman invaders of England for both defensive purposes and to pacify the country&#x27;s inhabitants. As William the Conqueror advanced through England, he fortified key positions to secure the land he had taken. Between 1066 and 1087, he established 36 castles such as Warwick Castle, which he used to guard against rebellion in the English Midlands.

Towards the end of the Middle Ages, castles tended to lose their military significance due to the advent of powerful cannons and permanent artillery fortifications; as a result, castles became more important as residences and statements of power. A castle could act as a stronghold and prison but was also a place where a knight or lord could entertain his peers. Over time the aesthetics of the design became more important, as the castle&#x27;s appearance and size began to reflect the prestige and power of its occupant. Comfortable homes were often fashioned within their fortified walls. Although castles still provided protection from low levels of violence in later periods, eventually they were succeeded by country houses as high-status residences.

===Terminology===
&quot;Castle&quot; is sometimes used as a catch-all term for all kinds of fortifications, and as a result has been misapplied in the technical sense. An example of this is Maiden Castle which, despite the name, is an Iron Age hill fort which had a very different origin and purpose.

Although &quot;castle&quot; has not become a generic term for a manor house (like &quot;château&quot; in French and &quot;Schloss&quot; in German), many manor houses contain &quot;castle&quot; in their name while having few if any of the architectural characteristics, usually as their owners liked to maintain a link to the past and felt the term &quot;castle&quot; was a masculine expression of their power. In scholarship the castle, as defined above, is generally accepted as a coherent concept, originating in Europe and later spreading to parts of the Middle East, where they were introduced by European Crusaders. This coherent group shared a common origin, dealt with a particular mode of warfare, and exchanged influences.

In different areas of the world, analogous structures shared features of fortification and other defining characteristics associated with the concept of a castle, though they originated in different periods and circumstances and experienced differing evolutions and influences. For example, &quot;shiro&quot; in Japan, described as castles by historian Stephen Turnbull, underwent &quot;a completely different developmental history, were built in a completely different way and were designed to withstand attacks of a completely different nature&quot;. While European castles built from the late 12th and early 13th century onwards were generally stone, &quot;shiro&quot; were predominantly timber buildings into the 16th century.

By the 16th century, when Japanese and European cultures met, fortification in Europe had moved beyond castles and relied on innovations such as the Italian &quot;trace italienne&quot; and star forts.

==Common features==

===Motte===
A motte was an earthen mound with a flat top. It was often artificial, although sometimes it incorporated a pre-existing feature of the landscape. The excavation of earth to make the mound left a ditch around the motte, called a moat (which could be either wet or dry). Although the motte is commonly associated with the bailey to form a motte-and-bailey castle, this was not always the case and there are instances where a motte existed on its own.

&quot;Motte&quot; refers to the mound alone, but it was often surmounted by a fortified structure, such as a keep, and the flat top would be surrounded by a palisade. It was common for the motte to be reached over a flying bridge (a bridge over the ditch from the counterscarp of the ditch to the edge of the top of the mound), as shown in the Bayeux Tapestry&#x27;s depiction of Château de Dinan. Sometimes a motte covered an older castle or hall, whose rooms became underground storage areas and prisons beneath a new keep.

===Bailey and enceinte===
A bailey, also called a ward, was a fortified enclosure. It was a common feature of castles, and most had at least one. The keep on top of the motte was the domicile of the lord in charge of the castle and a bastion of last defence, while the bailey was the home of the rest of the lord&#x27;s household and gave them protection. The barracks for the garrison, stables, workshops, and storage facilities were often found in the bailey. Water was supplied by a well or cistern. Over time the focus of high status accommodation shifted from the keep to the bailey; this resulted in the creation of another bailey that separated the high status buildings – such as the lord&#x27;s chambers and the chapel – from the everyday structures such as the workshops and barracks.

From the late 12th century there was a trend for knights to move out of the small houses they had previously occupied within the bailey to live in fortified houses in the countryside. Although often associated with the motte-and-bailey type of castle, baileys could also be found as independent defensive structures. These simple fortifications were called ringworks. The enceinte was the castle&#x27;s main defensive enclosure, and the terms &quot;bailey&quot; and &quot;enceinte&quot; are linked. A castle could have several baileys but only one enceinte. Castles with no keep, which relied on their outer defences for protection, are sometimes called enceinte castles; these were the earliest form of castles, before the keep was introduced in the 10th century.

===Keep===
A keep was a great tower or other building that served as the main living quarters of the castle and usually the most strongly defended point of a castle before the introduction of concentric defence. &quot;Keep&quot; was not a term used in the medieval period – the term was applied from the 16th century onwards – instead &quot;donjon&quot; was used to refer to great towers, or &quot;turris&quot; in Latin. In motte-and-bailey castles, the keep was on top of the motte. &quot;Dungeon&quot; is a corrupted form of &quot;donjon&quot; and means a dark, unwelcoming prison. Although often the strongest part of a castle and a last place of refuge if the outer defences fell, the keep was not left empty in case of attack but was used as a residence by the lord who owned the castle, or his guests or representatives.

At first, this was usual only in England, when after the Norman Conquest of 1066 the &quot;conquerors lived for a long time in a constant state of alert&quot;; elsewhere the lord&#x27;s wife presided over a separate residence (&quot;domus&quot;, &quot;aula&quot; or &quot;mansio&quot; in Latin) close to the keep, and the donjon was a barracks and headquarters. Gradually, the two functions merged into the same building, and the highest residential storeys had large windows; as a result for many structures, it is difficult to find an appropriate term. The massive internal spaces seen in many surviving donjons can be misleading; they would have been divided into several rooms by light partitions, as in a modern office building. Even in some large castles the great hall was separated only by a partition from the lord&#x27;s chamber, his bedroom and to some extent his office.

===Curtain wall===
Curtain walls were defensive walls enclosing a bailey. They had to be high enough to make scaling the walls with ladders difficult and thick enough to withstand bombardment from siege engines which, from the 15th century onwards, included gunpowder artillery. A typical wall could be thick and tall, although sizes varied greatly between castles. To protect them from undermining, curtain walls were sometimes given a stone skirt around their bases. Walkways along the tops of the curtain walls allowed defenders to rain missiles on enemies below, and battlements gave them further protection. Curtain walls were studded with towers to allow enfilading fire along the wall. Arrowslits in the walls did not become common in Europe until the 13th century, for fear that they might compromise the wall&#x27;s strength.

===Gatehouse===

The entrance was often the weakest part in a circuit of defences. To overcome this, the gatehouse was developed, allowing those inside the castle to control the flow of traffic. In earth and timber castles, the gateway was usually the first feature to be rebuilt in stone. The front of the gateway was a blind spot and to overcome this, projecting towers were added on each side of the gate in a style similar to that developed by the Romans. The gatehouse contained a series of defences to make a direct assault more difficult than battering down a simple gate. Typically, there were one or more portcullises – a wooden grille reinforced with metal to block a passage – and arrowslits to allow defenders to harry the enemy. The passage through the gatehouse was lengthened to increase the amount of time an assailant had to spend under fire in a confined space and unable to retaliate.

It is a popular myth that murder holes – openings in the ceiling of the gateway passage – were used to pour boiling oil or molten lead on attackers; the price of oil and lead and the distance of the gatehouse from fires meant that this was impractical. This method was, however, a common practice in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean castles and fortifications, where such resources were abundant. They were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, or to allow water to be poured on fires to extinguish them. Provision was made in the upper storey of the gatehouse for accommodation so the gate was never left undefended, although this arrangement later evolved to become more comfortable at the expense of defence.

During the 13th and 14th centuries the barbican was developed. This consisted of a rampart, ditch, and possibly a tower, in front of the gatehouse which could be used to further protect the entrance. The purpose of a barbican was not just to provide another line of defence but also to dictate the only approach to the gate.

===Moat===
A moat is a ditch surrounding a castle – or dividing one part of a castle from another – and could be either dry or filled with water. Its purpose often had a defensive purpose, preventing siege towers from reaching walls making mining harder, but could also be ornamental. Water moats were found in low-lying areas and were usually crossed by a drawbridge, although these were often replaced by stone bridges. The site of the 13th-century Caerphilly Castle in Wales covers over and the water defences, created by flooding the valley to the south of the castle, are some of the largest in Western Europe.

===Battlements===
Battlements were most often found surmounting curtain walls and the tops of gatehouses, and comprised several elements: crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks on top of a wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at, or drop objects on, attackers at the base of the wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Machicolations were stone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base of the wall in a similar fashion to hoardings.

===Arrowslits===
Arrowslits, also commonly called loopholes, were narrow vertical openings in defensive walls which allowed arrows or crossbow bolts to be fired on attackers. The narrow slits were intended to protect the defender by providing a very small target, but the size of the opening could also impede the defender if it was too small. A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming. Sometimes a sally port was included; this could allow the garrison to leave the castle and engage besieging forces. It was usual for the latrines to empty down the external walls of a castle and into the surrounding ditch.

===Postern===
A postern is a secondary door or gate in a concealed location, usually in a fortification such as a city wall.

=== Great hall ===
The great hall was a large, decorated room where a lord received his guests. The hall represented the prestige, authority, and richness of the lord. Events such as feasts, banquets, social or ceremonial gatherings, meetings of the military council, and judicial trials were held in the great hall. Sometimes the great hall existed as a separate building, in that case, it was called a hall-house.

==History==
===Antecedents===
Historian Charles Coulson states that the accumulation of wealth and resources, such as food, led to the need for defensive structures. The earliest fortifications originated in the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Europe, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls. In Northern Europe, hill forts were first developed in the Bronze Age, which then proliferated across Europe in the Iron Age. Hillforts in Britain typically used earthworks rather than stone as a building material.

Many earthworks survive today, along with evidence of palisades to accompany the ditches. In central and western Europe, oppida emerged in the 2nd century BC; these were densely inhabited fortified settlements, such as the oppidum of Manching. Some oppida walls were built on a massive scale, utilising stone, wood, iron and earth in their construction. The Romans encountered fortified settlements such as hill forts and oppida when expanding their territory into northern Europe. Their defences were often effective, and were only overcome by the extensive use of siege engines and other siege warfare techniques, such as at the Battle of Alesia. The Romans&#x27; own fortifications (&quot;castra&quot;) varied from simple temporary earthworks thrown up by armies on the move, to elaborate permanent stone constructions, notably the milecastles of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. Roman forts were generally rectangular with rounded corners – a &quot;playing-card shape&quot;.

In the medieval period, castles were influenced by earlier forms of elite architecture, contributing to regional variations. Importantly, while castles had military aspects, they contained a recognisable household structure within their walls, reflecting the multi-functional use of these buildings.

===Origins (9th and 10th centuries)===
The subject of the emergence of castles in Europe is a complex matter which has led to considerable debate. Discussions have typically attributed the rise of the castle to a reaction to attacks by Magyars, Muslims, and Vikings and a need for private defence. The breakdown of the Carolingian Empire led to the privatisation of government, and local lords assumed responsibility for the economy and justice. However, while castles proliferated in the 9th and 10th centuries the link between periods of insecurity and building fortifications is not always straightforward. Some high concentrations of castles occur in secure places, while some border regions had relatively few castles.

It is likely that the castle evolved from the practice of fortifying a lordly home. The greatest threat to a lord&#x27;s home or hall was fire as it was usually a wooden structure. To protect against this, and keep other threats at bay, there were several courses of action available: create encircling earthworks to keep an enemy at a distance; build the hall in stone; or raise it up on an artificial mound, known as a motte, to present an obstacle to attackers. While the concept of ditches, ramparts, and stone walls as defensive measures is ancient, raising a motte is a medieval innovation.

A bank and ditch enclosure was a simple form of defence, and when found without an associated motte is called a ringwork; when the site was in use for a prolonged period, it was sometimes replaced by a more complex structure or enhanced by the addition of a stone curtain wall. Building the hall in stone did not necessarily make it immune to fire as it still had windows and a wooden door. This led to the elevation of windows to the second storey – to make it harder to throw objects in – and to move the entrance from ground level to the second storey. These features are seen in many surviving castle keeps, which were the more sophisticated version of halls. Castles were not just defensive sites but also enhanced a lord&#x27;s control over his lands. They allowed the garrison to control the surrounding area, and formed a centre of administration, providing the lord with a place to hold court.

Building a castle sometimes required the permission of the king or other high authority. In 864 the King of West Francia, Charles the Bald, prohibited the construction of &quot;castella&quot; without his permission and ordered them all to be destroyed. This is perhaps the earliest reference to castles, though military historian R. Allen Brown points out that the word &quot;castella&quot; may have applied to any fortification at the time.

In some countries the monarch had little control over lords, or required the construction of new castles to aid in securing the land so was unconcerned about granting permission – as was the case in England in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest and the Holy Land during the Crusades. Switzerland is an extreme case of there being no state control over who built castles, and as a result there were 4,000 in the country. There are very few castles dated with certainty from the mid-9th century. Converted into a donjon around 950, Château de Doué-la-Fontaine in France is the oldest standing castle in Europe.

=== 11th century ===
From 1000 onwards, references to castles in texts such as charters increased greatly. Historians have interpreted this as evidence of a sudden increase in the number of castles in Europe around this time; this has been supported by archaeological investigation which has dated the construction of castle sites through the examination of ceramics. The increase in Italy began in the 950s, with numbers of castles increasing by a factor of three to five every 50 years, whereas in other parts of Europe such as France and Spain the growth was slower. In 950, Provence was home to 12 castles; by 1000, this figure had risen to 30, and by 1030 it was over 100. Although the increase was slower in Spain, the 1020s saw a particular growth in the number of castles in the region, particularly in contested border areas between Christian and Muslim lands.

Despite the common period in which castles rose to prominence in Europe, their form and design varied from region to region. In the early 11th century, the motte and keep – an artificial mound with a palisade and tower on top – was the most common form of castle in Europe, everywhere except Scandinavia. While Britain, France, and Italy shared a tradition of timber construction that was continued in castle architecture, Spain more commonly used stone or mud-brick as the main building material.

The Muslim invasion of the Iberian Peninsula in the 8th century introduced a style of building developed in North Africa reliant on &quot;tapial&quot;, pebbles in cement, where timber was in short supply. Although stone construction would later become common elsewhere, from the 11th century onwards it was the primary building material for Christian castles in Spain, while at the same time timber was still the dominant building material in north-west Europe.
Historians have interpreted the widespread presence of castles across Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries as evidence that warfare was common, and usually between local lords. Castles were introduced into England shortly before the Norman Conquest in 1066. Before the 12th century castles were as uncommon in Denmark as they had been in England before the Norman Conquest. The introduction of castles to Denmark was a reaction to attacks from Wendish pirates, and they were usually intended as coastal defences. The motte and bailey remained the dominant form of castle in England, Wales, and Ireland well into the 12th century. At the same time, castle architecture in mainland Europe became more sophisticated.

The donjon was at the centre of this change in castle architecture in the 12th century. Central towers proliferated, and typically had a square plan, with walls thick. Their decoration emulated Romanesque architecture, and sometimes incorporated double windows similar to those found in church bell towers. Donjons, which were the residence of the lord of the castle, evolved to become more spacious. The design emphasis of donjons changed to reflect a shift from functional to decorative requirements, imposing a symbol of lordly power upon the landscape. This sometimes led to compromising defence for the sake of display.

===Innovation and scientific design (12th century)===
:&quot;See also &quot;maison forte&quot;, French article here&quot;

Until the 12th century, stone-built and earth and timber castles were contemporary, but by the late 12th century the number of castles being built went into decline. This has been partly attributed to the higher cost of stone-built fortifications, and the obsolescence of timber and earthwork sites, which meant it was preferable to build in more durable stone. Although superseded by their stone successors, timber and earthwork castles were by no means useless. This is evidenced by the continual maintenance of timber castles over long periods, sometimes several centuries; Owain Glyndŵr&#x27;s 11th-century timber castle at Sycharth was still in use by the start of the 15th century, its structure having been maintained for four centuries.

At the same time there was a change in castle architecture. Until the late 12th century castles generally had few towers; a gateway with few defensive features such as arrowslits or a portcullis; a great keep or donjon, usually square and without arrowslits; and the shape would have been dictated by the lay of the land (the result was often irregular or curvilinear structures). The design of castles was not uniform, but these were features that could be found in a typical castle in the mid-12th century. By the end of the 12th century or the early 13th century, a newly constructed castle could be expected to be polygonal in shape, with towers at the corners to provide enfilading fire for the walls. The towers would have protruded from the walls and featured arrowslits on each level to allow archers to target anyone nearing or at the curtain wall.
These later castles did not always have a keep, but this may have been because the more complex design of the castle as a whole drove up costs and the keep was sacrificed to save money. The larger towers provided space for habitation to make up for the loss of the donjon. Where keeps did exist, they were no longer square but polygonal or cylindrical. Gateways were more strongly defended, with the entrance to the castle usually between two half-round towers which were connected by a passage above the gateway – although there was great variety in the styles of gateway and entrances – and one or more portcullis.

A peculiar feature of Muslim castles in the Iberian Peninsula was the use of detached towers, called Albarrana towers, around the perimeter as can be seen at the Alcazaba of Badajoz. Probably developed in the 12th century, the towers provided flanking fire. They were connected to the castle by removable wooden bridges, so if the towers were captured the rest of the castle was not accessible.
When seeking to explain this change in the complexity and style of castles, antiquarians found their answer in the Crusades. It seemed that the Crusaders had learned much about fortification from their conflicts with the Saracens and exposure to Byzantine architecture. There were legends such as that of Lalys – an architect from Palestine who reputedly went to Wales after the Crusades and greatly enhanced the castles in the south of the country – and it was assumed that great architects such as James of Saint George originated in the East. In the mid-20th century this view was cast into doubt. Legends were discredited, and in the case of James of Saint George it was proven that he came from Saint-Georges-d&#x27;Espéranche, in France. If the innovations in fortification had derived from the East, it would have been expected for their influence to be seen from 1100 onwards, immediately after the Christians were victorious in the First Crusade (1096–1099), rather than nearly 100 years later. Remains of Roman structures in Western Europe were still standing in many places, some of which had flanking round-towers and entrances between two flanking towers.

The castle builders of Western Europe were aware of and influenced by Roman design; late Roman coastal forts on the English &quot;Saxon Shore&quot; were reused and in Spain the wall around the city of Ávila imitated Roman architecture when it was built in 1091. Historian Smail in &quot;Crusading warfare&quot; argued that the case for the influence of Eastern fortification on the West has been overstated, and that Crusaders of the 12th century in fact learned very little about scientific design from Byzantine and Saracen defences. A well-sited castle that made use of natural defences and had strong ditches and walls had no need for a scientific design. An example of this approach is Kerak. Although there were no scientific elements to its design, it was almost impregnable, and in 1187 Saladin chose to lay siege to the castle and starve out its garrison rather than risk an assault.

During the late 11th and 12th centuries in what is now south-central Turkey the Hospitallers, Teutonic Knights and Templars established themselves in the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, where they discovered an extensive network of sophisticated fortifications which had a profound impact on the architecture of Crusader castles. Most of the Armenian military sites in Cilicia are characterized by: multiple bailey walls laid with irregular plans to follow the sinuosities of the outcrops; rounded and especially horseshoe-shaped towers; finely-cut often rusticated ashlar facing stones with intricate poured cores; concealed postern gates and complex bent entrances with slot machicolations; embrasured loopholes for archers; barrel, pointed or groined vaults over undercrofts, gates and chapels; and cisterns with elaborate scarped drains. Civilian settlement are often found in the immediate proximity of these fortifications. After the First Crusade, Crusaders who did not return to their homes in Europe helped found the Crusader states of the Principality of Antioch, the County of Edessa, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the County of Tripoli. The castles they founded to secure their acquisitions were designed mostly by Syrian master-masons. Their design was very similar to that of a Roman fort or Byzantine &quot;tetrapyrgia&quot; which were square in plan and had square towers at each corner that did not project much beyond the curtain wall. The keep of these Crusader castles would have had a square plan and generally be undecorated.

While castles were used to hold a site and control movement of armies, in the Holy Land some key strategic positions were left unfortified. Castle architecture in the East became more complex around the late 12th and early 13th centuries after the stalemate of the Third Crusade (1189–1192). Both Christians and Muslims created fortifications, and the character of each was different. Saphadin, the 13th-century ruler of the Saracens, created structures with large rectangular towers that influenced Muslim architecture and were copied again and again, however they had little influence on Crusader castles.

=== 13th to 15th centuries ===
In the early 13th century, Crusader castles were mostly built by Military Orders including the Knights Hospitaller, Knights Templar, and Teutonic Knights. The orders were responsible for the foundation of sites such as Krak des Chevaliers, Margat, and Belvoir. Design varied not just between orders, but between individual castles, though it was common for those founded in this period to have concentric defences.

The concept, which originated in castles such as Krak des Chevaliers, was to remove the reliance on a central strongpoint and to emphasise the defence of the curtain walls. There would be multiple rings of defensive walls, one inside the other, with the inner ring rising above the outer so that its field of fire was not completely obscured. If assailants made it past the first line of defence they would be caught in the killing ground between the inner and outer walls and have to assault the second wall.

Concentric castles were widely copied across Europe, for instance when Edward I of England – who had himself been on Crusade – built castles in Wales in the late 13th century, four of the eight he founded had a concentric design. Not all the features of the Crusader castles from the 13th century were emulated in Europe. For instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have the main gate in the side of a tower and for there to be two turns in the passageway, lengthening the time it took for someone to reach the outer enclosure. It is rare for this bent entrance to be found in Europe.
One of the effects of the Livonian Crusade in the Baltic was the introduction of stone and brick fortifications. Although there were hundreds of wooden castles in Prussia and Livonia, the use of bricks and mortar was unknown in the region before the Crusaders. Until the 13th century and start of the 14th centuries, their design was heterogeneous, however this period saw the emergence of a standard plan in the region: a square plan, with four wings around a central courtyard. It was common for castles in the East to have arrowslits in the curtain wall at multiple levels; contemporary builders in Europe were wary of this as they believed it weakened the wall. Arrowslits did not compromise the wall&#x27;s strength, but it was not until Edward I&#x27;s programme of castle building that they were widely adopted in Europe.

The Crusades also led to the introduction of machicolations into Western architecture. Until the 13th century, the tops of towers had been surrounded by wooden galleries, allowing defenders to drop objects on assailants below. Although machicolations performed the same purpose as the wooden galleries, they were probably an Eastern invention rather than an evolution of the wooden form. Machicolations were used in the East long before the arrival of the Crusaders, and perhaps as early as the first half of the 8th century in Syria.

The greatest period of castle building in Spain was in the 11th to 13th centuries, and they were most commonly found in the disputed borders between Christian and Muslim lands. Conflict and interaction between the two groups led to an exchange of architectural ideas, and Spanish Christians adopted the use of detached towers. The Spanish Reconquista, driving the Muslims out of the Iberian Peninsula, was complete in 1492.
Although France has been described as &quot;the heartland of medieval architecture&quot;, the English were at the forefront of castle architecture in the 12th century. French historian François Gebelin wrote: &quot;The great revival in military architecture was led, as one would naturally expect, by the powerful kings and princes of the time; by the sons of William the Conqueror and their descendants, the Plantagenets, when they became dukes of Normandy. These were the men who built all the most typical twelfth-century fortified castles remaining today&quot;. Despite this, by the beginning of the 15th century, the rate of castle construction in England and Wales went into decline. The new castles were generally of a lighter build than earlier structures and presented few innovations, although strong sites were still created such as that of Raglan in Wales. At the same time, French castle architecture came to the fore and led the way in the field of medieval fortifications. Across Europe – particularly the Baltic, Germany, and Scotland – castles were built well into the 16th century.

===Advent of gunpowder===
Artillery powered by gunpowder was introduced to Europe in the 1320s and spread quickly. Handguns, which were initially unpredictable and inaccurate weapons, were not recorded until the 1380s. Castles were adapted to allow small artillery pieces – averaging between  – to fire from towers. These guns were too heavy for a man to carry and fire, but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle on the edge of the gun port he could fire the weapon. The gun ports developed in this period show a unique feature, that of a horizontal timber across the opening. A hook on the end of the gun could be latched over the timber so the gunner did not have to take the full recoil of the weapon. This adaptation is found across Europe, and although the timber rarely survives, there is an intact example at Castle Doornenburg in the Netherlands. Gunports were keyhole shaped, with a circular hole at the bottom for the weapon and a narrow slit on top to allow the gunner to aim.

This form is very common in castles adapted for guns, found in Egypt, Italy, Scotland, and Spain, and elsewhere in between. Other types of port, though less common, were horizontal slits – allowing only lateral movement – and large square openings, which allowed greater movement. The use of guns for defence gave rise to artillery castles, such as that of Château de Ham in France. Defences against guns were not developed until a later stage. Ham is an example of the trend for new castles to dispense with earlier features such as machicolations, tall towers, and crenellations.

Bigger guns were developed, and in the 15th century became an alternative to siege engines such as the trebuchet. The benefits of large guns over trebuchets – the most effective siege engine of the Middle Ages before the advent of gunpowder – were those of a greater range and power. In an effort to make them more effective, guns were made ever bigger, although this hampered their ability to reach remote castles. By the 1450s guns were the preferred siege weapon, and their effectiveness was demonstrated by Mehmed II at the Fall of Constantinople.

The response towards more effective cannons was to build thicker walls and to prefer round towers, as the curving sides were more likely to deflect a shot than a flat surface. While this sufficed for new castles, pre-existing structures had to find a way to cope with being battered by cannon. An earthen bank could be piled behind a castle&#x27;s curtain wall to absorb some of the shock of impact.

Often, castles constructed before the age of gunpowder were incapable of using guns as their wall-walks were too narrow. A solution to this was to pull down the top of a tower and to fill the lower part with the rubble to provide a surface for the guns to fire from. Lowering the defences in this way had the effect of making them easier to scale with ladders. A more popular alternative defence, which avoided damaging the castle, was to establish bulwarks beyond the castle&#x27;s defences. These could be built from earth or stone and were used to mount weapons.

=== Bastions and star forts (16th century) ===
Around 1500, the innovation of the angled bastion was developed in Italy. With developments such as these, Italy pioneered permanent artillery fortifications, which took over from the defensive role of castles. From this evolved star forts, also known as &quot;trace italienne&quot;. The elite responsible for castle construction had to choose between the new type that could withstand cannon fire and the earlier, more elaborate style. The first was ugly and uncomfortable and the latter was less secure, although it did offer greater aesthetic appeal and value as a status symbol. The second choice proved to be more popular as it became apparent that there was little point in trying to make the site genuinely defensible in the face of cannon. For a variety of reasons, not least of which is that many castles have no recorded history, there is no firm number of castles built in the medieval period. However, it has been estimated that between 75,000 and 100,000 were built in western Europe; of these around 1,700 were in England and Wales and around 14,000 in German-speaking areas.

Some true castles were built in the Americas by the Spanish and French colonies. The first stage of Spanish fort construction has been termed the &quot;castle period&quot;, which lasted from 1492 until the end of the 16th century. Starting with Fortaleza Ozama, &quot;these castles were essentially European medieval castles transposed to America&quot;. Among other defensive structures (including forts and citadels), castles were also built in New France towards the end of the 17th century. In Montreal the artillery was not as developed as on the battle-fields of Europe, some of the region&#x27;s outlying forts were built like the fortified manor houses of France. Fort Longueuil, built from 1695 to 1698 by a baronial family, has been described as &quot;the most medieval-looking fort built in Canada&quot;. The manor house and stables were within a fortified bailey, with a tall round turret in each corner. The &quot;most substantial castle-like fort&quot; near Montréal was Fort Senneville, built in 1692 with square towers connected by thick stone walls, as well as a fortified windmill. Stone forts such as these served as defensive residences, as well as imposing structures to prevent Iroquois incursions.

Although castle construction faded towards the end of the 16th century, castles did not necessarily all fall out of use. Some retained a role in local administration and became law courts, while others are still handed down in aristocratic families as hereditary seats. A particularly famous example of this is Windsor Castle in England which was founded in the 11th century and is home to the monarch of the United Kingdom. In other cases they still had a role in defence. Tower houses, which are closely related to castles and include pele towers, were defended towers that were permanent residences built in the 14th to 17th centuries. Especially common in Ireland and Scotland, they could be up to five storeys high and succeeded common enclosure castles and were built by a greater social range of people. While unlikely to provide as much protection as a more complex castle, they offered security against raiders and other small threats.

===Later use and revival castles===

According to archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham, &quot;the great country houses of the seventeenth to twentieth centuries were, in a social sense, the castles of their day&quot;. Though there was a trend for the elite to move from castles into country houses in the 17th century, castles were not completely useless. In later conflicts, such as the English Civil War (1641–1651), many castles were refortified, although subsequently slighted to prevent them from being used again. Some country residences, which were not meant to be fortified, were given a castle appearance to scare away potential invaders such as adding turrets and using small windows. An example of this is the 16th century Bubaqra Castle in Bubaqra, Malta, which was modified in the 18th century.

Revival or mock castles became popular as a manifestation of a Romantic interest in the Middle Ages and chivalry, and as part of the broader Gothic Revival in architecture. Examples of these castles include Chapultepec in Mexico, Neuschwanstein in Germany, and Edwin Lutyens&#x27; Castle Drogo (1911–1930) – the last flicker of this movement in the British Isles. While churches and cathedrals in a Gothic style could faithfully imitate medieval examples, new country houses built in a &quot;castle style&quot; differed internally from their medieval predecessors. This was because to be faithful to medieval design would have left the houses cold and dark by contemporary standards.

Artificial ruins, built to resemble remnants of historic edifices, were also a hallmark of the period. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies were similar, although they differed from artificial ruins in that they were not part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built. Both drew on elements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but served no military purpose and were solely for display. A toy castle is used as a common children attraction in playing fields and fun parks, such as the castle of the Playmobil FunPark in Ħal Far, Malta.

==Construction==


Once the site of a castle had been selected – whether a strategic position or one intended to dominate the landscape as a mark of power – the building material had to be selected. An earth and timber castle was cheaper and easier to erect than one built from stone. The costs involved in construction are not well-recorded, and most surviving records relate to royal castles. A castle with earthen ramparts, a motte, timber defences and buildings could have been constructed by an unskilled workforce. The source of man-power was probably from the local lordship, and the tenants would already have the necessary skills of felling trees, digging, and working timber necessary for an earth and timber castle. Possibly coerced into working for their lord, the construction of an earth and timber castle would not have been a drain on a client&#x27;s funds. In terms of time, it has been estimated that an average sized motte – high and wide at the summit – would have taken 50 people about 40 working days. An exceptionally expensive motte and bailey was that of Clones in Ireland, built in 1211 for UK£20. The high cost, relative to other castles of its type, was because labourers had to be imported.

The cost of building a castle varied according to factors such as their complexity and transport costs for material. It is certain that stone castles cost a great deal more than those built from earth and timber. Even a very small tower, such as Peveril Castle, would have cost around UK£200. In the middle were castles such as Orford, which was built in the late 12th century for UK£1,400, and at the upper end were those such as Dover, which cost about UK£7,000 between 1181 and 1191. Spending on the scale of the vast castles such as Château Gaillard (an estimated UK£15,000 to UK£20,000 between 1196 and 1198) was easily supported by The Crown, but for lords of smaller areas, castle building was a very serious and costly undertaking. It was usual for a stone castle to take the best part of a decade to finish. The cost of a large castle built over this time (anywhere from UK£1,000 to UK£10,000) would take the income from several manors, severely impacting a lord&#x27;s finances. Costs in the late 13th century were of a similar order, with castles such as Beaumaris and Rhuddlan costing UK£14,500 and UK£9,000 respectively. Edward I&#x27;s campaign of castle-building in Wales cost UK£80,000 between 1277 and 1304, and UK£95,000 between 1277 and 1329. Renowned designer Master James of Saint George, responsible for the construction of Beaumaris, explained the cost:

Not only were stone castles expensive to build in the first place, but their maintenance was a constant drain. They contained a lot of timber, which was often unseasoned and as a result needed careful upkeep. For example, it is documented that in the late 12th century repairs at castles such as Exeter and Gloucester cost between UK£20 and UK£50 annually.

Medieval machines and inventions, such as the treadwheel crane, became indispensable during construction, and techniques of building wooden scaffolding were improved upon from Antiquity. When building in stone a prominent concern of medieval builders was to have quarries close at hand. There are examples of some castles where stone was quarried on site, such as Chinon, Château de Coucy and Château Gaillard. When it was built in 992 in France the stone tower at Château de Langeais was high, wide, and long with walls averaging . The walls contain of stone and have a total surface (both inside and out) of . The tower is estimated to have taken 83,000 average working days to complete, most of which was unskilled labour.

Many countries had both timber and stone castles, however Denmark had few quarries and as a result most of its castles are earth and timber affairs, or later on built from brick. Brick-built structures were not necessarily weaker than their stone-built counterparts. Brick castles are less common in England than stone or earth and timber constructions, and often it was chosen for its aesthetic appeal or because it was fashionable, encouraged by the brick architecture of the Low Countries. For example, when Tattershall Castle in England was built between 1430 and 1450, there was plenty of stone available nearby, but the owner, Lord Cromwell, chose to use brick. About 700,000 bricks were used to build the castle, which has been described as &quot;the finest piece of medieval brick-work in England&quot;. Most Spanish castles were built from stone, whereas castles in Eastern Europe were usually of timber construction.

&quot;On the Construction of the Castle of Safed&quot;, written in the early 1260s, describes the construction of a new castle at Safed. It is &quot;one of the fullest&quot; medieval accounts of a castle&#x27;s construction.

==Social centre==

Due to the lord&#x27;s presence in a castle, it was a centre of administration from where he controlled his lands. He relied on the support of those below him, as without the support of his more powerful tenants a lord could expect his power to be undermined. Successful lords regularly held court with those immediately below them on the social scale, but absentees could expect to find their influence weakened. Larger lordships could be vast, and it would be impractical for a lord to visit all his properties regularly, so deputies were appointed. This especially applied to royalty, who sometimes owned land in different countries.

To allow the lord to concentrate on his duties regarding administration, he had a household of servants to take care of chores such as providing food. The household was run by a chamberlain, while a treasurer took care of the estate&#x27;s written records. Royal households took essentially the same form as baronial households, although on a much larger scale and the positions were more prestigious. An important role of the household servants was the preparation of food; the castle kitchens would have been a busy place when the castle was occupied, called on to provide large meals. Without the presence of a lord&#x27;s household, usually because he was staying elsewhere, a castle would have been a quiet place with few residents, focused on maintaining the castle.

As social centres castles were important places for display. Builders took the opportunity to draw on symbolism, through the use of motifs, to evoke a sense of chivalry that was aspired to in the Middle Ages amongst the elite. Later structures of the Romantic revival would draw on elements of castle architecture such as battlements for the same purpose. Castles have been compared with cathedrals as objects of architectural pride, and some castles incorporated gardens as ornamental features. The right to crenellate, when granted by a monarch – though it was not always necessary – was important not just as it allowed a lord to defend his property but because crenellations and other accoutrements associated with castles were prestigious through their use by the elite. Licences to crenellate were also proof of a relationship with or favour from the monarch, who was the one responsible for granting permission.

Courtly love was the eroticisation of love between the nobility. Emphasis was placed on restraint between lovers. Though sometimes expressed through chivalric events such as tournaments, where knights would fight wearing a token from their lady, it could also be private and conducted in secret. The legend of Tristan and Iseult is one example of stories of courtly love told in the Middle Ages. It was an ideal of love between two people not married to each other, although the man might be married to someone else. It was not uncommon or ignoble for a lord to be adulterous – Henry I of England had over 20 bastards for instance – but for a lady to be promiscuous was seen as dishonourable.

The purpose of marriage between the medieval elites was to secure land. Girls were married in their teens, but boys did not marry until they came of age. There is a popular conception that women played a peripheral role in the medieval castle household, and that it was dominated by the lord himself. This derives from the image of the castle as a martial institution, but most castles in England, France, Ireland, and Scotland were never involved in conflicts or sieges, so the domestic life is a neglected facet. The lady was given a dower of her husband&#x27;s estates – usually about a third – which was hers for life, and her husband would inherit on her death. It was her duty to administer them directly, as the lord administered his own land. Despite generally being excluded from military service, a woman could be in charge of a castle, either on behalf of her husband or if she was widowed. Because of their influence within the medieval household, women influenced construction and design, sometimes through direct patronage; historian Charles Coulson emphasises the role of women in applying &quot;a refined aristocratic taste&quot; to castles due to their long term residence.

==Locations and landscapes==
The positioning of castles was influenced by the available terrain. Whereas hill castles such as Marksburg were common in Germany, where 66 per cent of all known medieval were highland area while 34 per cent were on low-lying land, they formed a minority of sites in England. Because of the range of functions they had to fulfil, castles were built in a variety of locations. Multiple factors were considered when choosing a site, balancing between the need for a defendable position with other considerations such as proximity to resources. For instance many castles are located near Roman roads, which remained important transport routes in the Middle Ages, or could lead to the alteration or creation of new road systems in the area. Where available it was common to exploit pre-existing defences such as building with a Roman fort or the ramparts of an Iron Age hillfort. A prominent site that overlooked the surrounding area and offered some natural defences may also have been chosen because its visibility made it a symbol of power. Urban castles were particularly important in controlling centres of population and production, especially with an invading force, for instance in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest of England in the 11th century the majority of royal castles were built in or near towns.
As castles were not simply military buildings but centres of administration and symbols of power, they had a significant impact on the surrounding landscape. Placed by a frequently-used road or river, the toll castle ensured that a lord would get his due toll money from merchants. Rural castles were often associated with mills and field systems due to their role in managing the lord&#x27;s estate, which gave them greater influence over resources. Others were adjacent to or in royal forests or deer parks and were important in their upkeep. Fish ponds were a luxury of the lordly elite, and many were found next to castles. Not only were they practical in that they ensured a water supply and fresh fish, but they were a status symbol as they were expensive to build and maintain.

Although sometimes the construction of a castle led to the destruction of a village, such as at Eaton Socon in England, it was more common for the villages nearby to have grown as a result of the presence of a castle. Sometimes planned towns or villages were created around a castle. The benefits of castle building on settlements was not confined to Europe. When the 13th-century Safad Castle was founded in Galilee in the Holy Land, the 260 villages benefitted from the inhabitants&#x27; newfound ability to move freely. When built, a castle could result in the restructuring of the local landscape, with roads moved for the convenience of the lord. Settlements could also grow naturally around a castle, rather than being planned, due to the benefits of proximity to an economic centre in a rural landscape and the safety given by the defences. Not all such settlements survived, as once the castle lost its importance – perhaps succeeded by a manor house as the centre of administration – the benefits of living next to a castle vanished and the settlement depopulated.
During and shortly after the Norman Conquest of England, castles were inserted into important pre-existing towns to control and subdue the populace. They were usually located near any existing town defences, such as Roman walls, although this sometimes resulted in the demolition of structures occupying the desired site. In Lincoln, 166 houses were destroyed to clear space for the castle, and in York agricultural land was flooded to create a moat for the castle. As the military importance of urban castles waned from their early origins, they became more important as centres of administration, and their financial and judicial roles. When the Normans invaded Ireland, Scotland, and Wales in the 11th and 12th centuries, settlement in those countries was predominantly non-urban, and the foundation of towns was often linked with the creation of a castle.
The location of castles in relation to high status features, such as fish ponds, was a statement of power and control of resources. Also often found near a castle, sometimes within its defences, was the parish church. This signified a close relationship between feudal lords and the Church, one of the most important institutions of medieval society. Even elements of castle architecture that have usually been interpreted as military could be used for display. The water features of Kenilworth Castle in England – comprising a moat and several satellite ponds – forced anyone approaching a water castle entrance to take a very indirect route, walking around the defences before the final approach towards the gateway. Another example is that of the 14th-century Bodiam Castle, also in England; although it appears to be a state of the art, advanced castle it is in a site of little strategic importance, and the moat was shallow and more likely intended to make the site appear impressive than as a defence against mining. The approach was long and took the viewer around the castle, ensuring they got a good look before entering. Moreover, the gunports were impractical and unlikely to have been effective.

==Warfare==

As a static structure, castles could often be avoided. Their immediate area of influence was about and their weapons had a short range even early in the age of artillery. However, leaving an enemy behind would allow them to interfere with communications and make raids. Garrisons were expensive and as a result often small unless the castle was important. Cost also meant that in peacetime garrisons were smaller, and small castles were manned by perhaps a couple of watchmen and gate-guards. Even in war, garrisons were not necessarily large as too many people in a defending force would strain supplies and impair the castle&#x27;s ability to withstand a long siege. In 1403, a force of 37 archers successfully defended Caernarfon Castle against two assaults by Owain Glyndŵr&#x27;s allies during a long siege, demonstrating that a small force could be effective.

Early on, manning a castle was a feudal duty of vassals to their magnates, and magnates to their kings, however this was later replaced with paid forces. A garrison was usually commanded by a constable whose peacetime role would have been looking after the castle in the owner&#x27;s absence. Under him would have been knights who by benefit of their military training would have acted as a type of officer class. Below them were archers and bowmen, whose role was to prevent the enemy reaching the walls as can be seen by the positioning of arrowslits.

If it was necessary to seize control of a castle an army could either launch an assault or lay siege. It was more efficient to starve the garrison out than to assault it, particularly for the most heavily defended sites. Without relief from an external source, the defenders would eventually submit. Sieges could last weeks, months, and in rare cases years if the supplies of food and water were plentiful. A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later. Such an approach was not confined to castles, but was also applied to the fortified towns of the day. On occasion, siege castles would be built to defend the besiegers from a sudden sally and would have been abandoned after the siege ended one way or another.
If forced to assault a castle, there were many options available to the attackers. For wooden structures, such as early motte-and-baileys, fire was a real threat and attempts would be made to set them alight as can be seen in the Bayeux Tapestry. Projectile weapons had been used since antiquity and the mangonel and petraria – from Eastern and Roman origins respectively – were the main two that were used into the Middle Ages. The trebuchet, which probably evolved from the petraria in the 13th century, was the most effective siege weapon before the development of cannons. These weapons were vulnerable to fire from the castle as they had a short range and were large machines. Conversely, weapons such as trebuchets could be fired from within the castle due to the high trajectory of its projectile, and would be protected from direct fire by the curtain walls.

Ballistas or springalds were siege engines that worked on the same principles as crossbows. With their origins in Ancient Greece, tension was used to project a bolt or javelin. Missiles fired from these engines had a lower trajectory than trebuchets or mangonels and were more accurate. They were more commonly used against the garrison rather than the buildings of a castle. Eventually cannons developed to the point where they were more powerful and had a greater range than the trebuchet, and became the main weapon in siege warfare.

Walls could be undermined by a sap. A mine leading to the wall would be dug and once the target had been reached, the wooden supports preventing the tunnel from collapsing would be burned. It would cave in and bring down the structure above. Building a castle on a rock outcrop or surrounding it with a wide, deep moat helped prevent this. A counter-mine could be dug towards the besiegers&#x27; tunnel; assuming the two converged, this would result in underground hand-to-hand combat. Mining was so effective that during the siege of Margat in 1285 when the garrison were informed a sap was being dug they surrendered. Battering rams were also used, usually in the form of a tree trunk given an iron cap. They were used to force open the castle gates, although they were sometimes used against walls with less effect.

As an alternative to the time-consuming task of creating a breach, an escalade could be attempted to capture the walls with fighting along the walkways behind the battlements. In this instance, attackers would be vulnerable to arrow fire. A safer option for those assaulting a castle was to use a siege tower, sometimes called a belfry. Once ditches around a castle were partially filled in, these wooden, movable towers could be pushed against the curtain wall. As well as offering some protection for those inside, a siege tower could overlook the interior of a castle, giving bowmen an advantageous position from which to unleash missiles.

<doc id="49559" wikidata="Q55498" url="?curid=49559" title="Yalu River">
<text>The Yalu River () or Amnok River () is a river on the border between China and North Korea. Together with the Tumen River to its east, and a small portion of Paektu Mountain, the Yalu forms the border between China and North Korea. Its valley has been the scene of several military conflicts in the past centuries. 
It borders North Korea to the south and China to the north.

==Name==
The Chinese name &quot;Yalu&quot; (&quot;duck-green&quot;) was first attested during the Tang dynasty. According to the &quot;Tongdian&quot; (8th century), the river was named after its color, which resembled that of a mallard&#x27;s head. The Korean name &quot;Amnok&quot; follows the Sino-Korean reading of the same name. In ancient times, the river was known as &quot;Peishui&quot; (&quot;Paesu&quot;, 浿水) or &quot;Mazishui&quot; (&quot;Majasu&quot;, 馬訾水).

Historically, it was also known by the Korean name of &quot;Arinarye&quot; (아리나례강, 阿利那禮江). &quot;Ari&quot;, a word from Old Korean used to refer to the &#x27;spirituality (신령성; 神靈性) of the sun&#x27;. The second component might be related to the Old Korean word for &#x27;river, stream&#x27;, nari (나리, 川理).

Two other theories exist for the name Yalu: one theory is that the name derived from &quot;Yalu ula&quot; () in the Manchu language. The Manchu word &quot;yalu&quot; () means &quot;the boundary between two countries&quot;. In Mandarin Chinese, phonetically approximates the original Manchu word, but literally means &quot;duck green&quot;, which was said to have been once the color of the river. The other theory is that the river was named after the combination of its two upper branches, which were called &quot;&quot; ( or&quot; Ap&quot;) and &quot;&quot; ( or &quot;R&quot;(or &quot;n&quot;)&quot;ok&quot;)&quot;, respectively.

Revised Romanization of Korean spelled it (; &quot;Amnok River&quot;) and Revised Romanization of Hangeul spelled it (; &quot;Aprok River&quot;).

==Geography==
From above sea level on Paektu Mountain on the China–North Korea border, the river flows south to Hyesan before sweeping north-west to Linjiang and then returning to a more southerly route for a further to empty into Korea Bay between Dandong (China) and Sinuiju (North Korea). The bordering Chinese provinces are Jilin and Liaoning, while the bordering North Korean provinces are North Pyongan, Chagang and Ryanggang.

The river is long and receives water from over of land. The Yalu&#x27;s most significant tributaries are the Changjin (), the Hochon (), the Togro () rivers from Korea and the Ai (or Aihe) () and the Hun () from China. The river is not easily navigable for most of its length. Most of the river freezes during winter and can be crossed on foot.

The depth of the Yalu River varies from some of the more shallow parts on the eastern side in Hyesan () to the deeper parts of the river near the Yellow Sea (). The estuary is the site of the Amrok River estuary Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International.

About 205 islands are on the Yalu. A 1962 border treaty between North Korea and China split the islands according to which ethnic group was living on each island. North Korea possesses 127 and China 78. Due to the division criteria, some islands such as Hwanggumpyong Island belong to North Korea, but abut the Chinese side of the river.

==History==
The river basin is the site where the ancient Korean kingdom of Goguryeo rose to power. Many former fortresses are located along the river and the former capital of that kingdom was situated at what is now the medium-sized city of Ji&#x27;an along the Yalu, a site rich in Goguryeo-era relics.
Wihwa Island on the river is historically famous as the place where, in 1388, General Yi Songgye (later Taejo of Joseon) decided to turn back his army southward to Kaesong in the first of a series of revolts that eventually led to the establishment of the Joseon dynasty.

The river has been the site of several battles because of its strategic location between Korea and China, including:

* Battle of the Yalu River (1894) – First Sino-Japanese War
* Battle of Yalu River (1904) – Russo-Japanese War
* Battle near to the Yalu River (1950) – Korean War

The southern side of the river was heavily industrialized during the period of Japanese rule (1910–1945), and by 1945 almost 20% of Japan&#x27;s total industrial output originated in Korea.

During the Korean War, the movement of United Nations troops approaching the river, despite repeated warnings by China not to, precipitated massive Chinese intervention from around Dandong. In the course of the conflict every bridge across the river except one was destroyed. The one remaining bridge was the Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge connecting Sinuiju, North Korea to Dandong, China. During the war the valley surrounding the western end of the river also became the focal point of a series of dogfights for air supremacy over North Korea, earning the nickname &quot;MiG Alley&quot; in reference to the MiG-15 fighters flown by the combined North Korean, Chinese, and Soviet forces. As UN forces during the Korean War advanced toward the Yalu, China under Chairman Mao Zedong entered the war on the side of North Korea under dictator Kim Il-sung.

The river has frequently been crossed by North Koreans fleeing to China since the early 1990s, although the Tumen River remains the most-used way for such refugees.

According to one scholar, the Korean-Chinese border along the Yalu River is the longest unchanged international border in history, lasting for at least 1,000 years.

==Economy==
The river is important for hydroelectric power, and one of the largest hydroelectric dams in Asia is in Sup&#x27;ung Dam, high and over long, located upstream from Sinuiju, North Korea. The dam has created an artificial lake over a portion of the river, called Supung Lake. In addition, the river is used for transportation, particularly of lumber from its forested banks. The river provides fish for the local population. Downstream of Sup&#x27;ung is the Taipingwan Dam. Upstream of Sup&#x27;ung is the Unbong Dam. Both dams produce hydroelectric power, as well.

In the river delta upstream from Dandong and adjacent to Hushan are several North Korean villages. Economic conditions in these villages have been described as poor, without access to electricity.

<text>Nicolae Ceaușescu ( ; ;  – 25 December 1989) was a Romanian politician who was the second and last communist leader of Romania, serving as the general secretary of the Romanian Communist Party from 1965 to 1989. Widely regarded as a dictator, he was the country&#x27;s head of state from 1967 to 1989, serving as President of the State Council from 1967 and as the first president from 1974. He was overthrown and executed in the Romanian Revolution in December 1989 along with his wife Elena Ceaușescu, as part of a series of anti-communist uprisings in Eastern Europe that year.

Born in 1918 in Scornicești, Ceaușescu was a member of the Romanian Communist youth movement. He was arrested in 1939 and sentenced for &quot;conspiracy against social order&quot;, spending the time during the war in prisons and internment camps: Jilava (1940), Caransebeș (1942), Văcărești (1943), and Târgu Jiu (1943). Ceaușescu rose up through the ranks of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s Socialist government and, upon Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s death in 1965, he succeeded to the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party as general secretary.

Upon achieving power, Ceaușescu eased press censorship and condemned the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in his speech of 21 August 1968, which resulted in a surge in popularity. However, this period of stability was brief, as his government soon became totalitarian and came to be considered the most repressive in the Eastern Bloc. His secret police, the Securitate, was responsible for mass surveillance as well as severe repression and human rights abuses within the country, and controlled the media and press. Ceaușescu&#x27;s attempts to implement policies that would lead to a significant growth of the population led to a growing number of illegal abortions and increased the number of orphans in state institutions. Economic mismanagement due to failed oil ventures during the 1970s led to very significant foreign debts for Romania. In 1982, Ceaușescu directed the government to export much of the country&#x27;s agricultural and industrial production in an effort to repay these debts. His cult of personality experienced unprecedented elevation, followed by the deterioration of foreign relations, even with the Soviet Union.

As anti-government protesters demonstrated in Timișoara in December 1989, Ceaușescu perceived the demonstrations as a political threat and ordered military forces to open fire on 17 December, causing many deaths and injuries. The revelation that Ceaușescu was responsible resulted in a massive spread of rioting and civil unrest across the country. The demonstrations, which reached Bucharest, became known as the Romanian Revolution—the only violent overthrow of a communist government in the course of the Revolutions of 1989. Ceaușescu and his wife Elena fled the capital in a helicopter enrouting to Vatican via Vienna, Austria, but they were captured in Romanian territory by the military after the armed forces defected. After being tried and convicted of economic sabotage and genocide, both were sentenced to death, and they were immediately executed by firing squad on 25 December.

==Early life==

Ceaușescu was born in the small village of Scornicești, Olt County, being the third of nine children of a poor peasant family (see Ceaușescu family). Based on his birth certificate, he was born on , rather than the official —his birth was registered with a three-day delay, which later led to confusion. According to the information recorded in his autobiography, Nicolae Ceaușescu was born on 26 January 1918. His father Andruță (1886–1969) owned of agricultural land and a few sheep, and Nicolae supplemented his large family&#x27;s income through tailoring. He studied at the village school until the age of 11, when he left for Bucharest. The Olt County Service of National Archives holds excerpts from the catalogs of Scornicești Primary School, which certifies that Nicolae A. Ceaușescu passed the first grade with an average of 8.26 and the second grade with an average of 8.18, ranking third, in a class in which 25 students were enrolled. Journalist Cătălin Gruia claimed in 2007 that he ran away from his supposedly extremely religious, abusive and strict father. He initially lived with his sister, Niculina Rusescu.

He became an apprentice shoemaker, working in the workshop of Alexandru Săndulescu, a shoemaker who was an active member in the then-illegal Communist Party. Ceaușescu was soon involved in the Communist Party activities (becoming a member in early 1932), but as a teenager he was given only small tasks. He was first arrested in 1933, at the age of 15, for street fighting during a strike and again, in 1934, first for collecting signatures on a petition protesting against the trial of railway workers and twice more for other similar activities. By the mid-1930s, he had been in missions in Bucharest, Craiova, Câmpulung and Râmnicu Vâlcea, being arrested several times.

The profile file from the secret police, Siguranța Statului, named him &quot;a dangerous Communist agitator&quot; and &quot;distributor of Communist and antifascist propaganda materials&quot;. For these charges, he was convicted on 6 June 1936 by the Brașov Tribunal to 2 years in prison, an additional 6 months for contempt of court, and one year of forced residence in Scornicești. He spent most of his sentence in Doftana Prison. While out of jail in 1939, he met Elena Petrescu, whom he married in 1946 and who would play an increasing role in his political life over the years.
Soon after being freed, he was arrested again and sentenced for &quot;conspiracy against social order&quot;, spending the time during the war in prisons and internment camps: Jilava (1940), Caransebeș (1942), Văcărești (1943), and Târgu Jiu (1943).

In 1943, he was transferred to Târgu Jiu internment camp, where he shared a cell with Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, becoming his protégé.

Enticed with substantial bribes, the camp authorities gave the Communist prisoners much freedom in running their cell block, provided they did not attempt to break out of prison. At Târgu Jiu, Gheorghiu-Dej ran &quot;self-criticism sessions&quot; where various Party members had to confess before the other Party members to misunderstanding the teachings of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, and Joseph Stalin as interpreted by Gheorghiu-Dej; journalist Edward Behr claimed that Ceaușescu&#x27;s role in these &quot;self-criticism sessions&quot; was that of the enforcer, the young man allegedly beating those Party members who refused to go with or were insufficiently enthusiastic about the &quot;self-criticism&quot; sessions. These &quot;self-criticism sessions&quot; not only helped to cement Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s control over the Party, but also endeared his protégé Ceaușescu to him. It was Ceaușescu&#x27;s time at Târgu Jiu that marked the beginning of his rise to power. After World War II, when Romania was beginning to fall under Soviet influence, Ceaușescu served as secretary of the Union of Communist Youth (1944–1945).

After the Communists seized power in Romania in 1947, and under the patronage of Gheorghiu-Dej, Ceaușescu was elected a member of the Great National Assembly, the new legislative body of communist Romania.

In May 1948, Ceaușescu was appointed Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture, and in March 1949 he was promoted to the position of Deputy Minister. From the Ministry of Agriculture and with no military experience, he was made Deputy Minister in charge of the armed forces, holding the rank of Major General. Later, promoted to the rank of lieutenant general, he became First Deputy to the Ministry of Defense and head of the Army&#x27;s Higher Political Directorate. Ceaușescu studied at the Soviet Frunze Military Academy in Moscow for two consecutive months in both 1951 and 1952.

In 1952, Gheorghiu-Dej brought him onto the Central Committee months after the party&#x27;s &quot;Muscovite faction&quot; led by Ana Pauker had been purged. In the late 1940s-early 1950s, the Party had been divided into the &quot;home communists&quot; headed by Gheorghiu-Dej who remained inside Romania prior to 1944 and the &quot;Muscovites&quot; who had gone into exile in the Soviet Union. With the partial exception of Poland, where the Polish October crisis of 1956 brought to power the previously imprisoned &quot;home communist&quot; Władysław Gomułka, Romania was the only Eastern European nation where the &quot;home communists&quot; triumphed over the &quot;Muscovites&quot;. In the rest of the Soviet bloc, there were a series of purges in this period that led to the &quot;home communists&quot; being executed or imprisoned. Like his patron Gheorghiu-Dej, Ceaușescu was a &quot;home communist&quot; who benefited from the fall of the &quot;Muscovites&quot; in 1952. In 1954, Ceaușescu became a full member of the Politburo, effectively granting him one of the highest positions of power in the country.

=== Ceaușescu during the collectivization process ===
As a high-ranking state official in the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Defence Ceaușescu had an important role in the forced collectivisation, according to own Romanian Workers&#x27; Party data, between 1949 and 1952 there were over 80,000 arrests of peasants and 30,000 ended with prison sentences. One example is the uprising of Vadu Roșca (Vrancea county) which opposed the state program of expropriation of private holdings, when military units opened fire on the rebelling peasants, killing 9 and wounding 48. Ceaușescu personally led the investigation which resulted in 18 peasants being imprisoned for &quot;rebellion&quot; and &quot;conspiring against social order&quot;.

==Leadership of Romania==

When Gheorghiu-Dej died on 19 March 1965, Ceaușescu was not the obvious successor, despite his closeness to the longtime leader. But widespread infighting by older and more connected officials led the Politburo to choose Ceaușescu as a compromise candidate. He was elected general secretary on 22 March 1965, three days after Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s death.

One of Ceaușescu&#x27;s first acts was to change the name of the party from the Romanian Workers&#x27; Party back to the Communist Party of Romania and to declare the country a socialist republic, rather than a people&#x27;s republic. In 1967, he consolidated his power by becoming president of the State Council, making him head of state. His political apparatus sent many thousands of political opponents to prison or psychiatric hospitals.

Initially, Ceaușescu became a popular figure, both in Romania and in the West, because of his independent foreign policy, which challenged the authority of the Soviet Union. In the 1960s, he eased press censorship and ended Romania&#x27;s active participation in the Warsaw Pact, but Romania formally remained a member. He refused to take part in the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact forces and even actively and openly condemned it in his 21 August 1968 speech. He travelled to Prague a week before the invasion to offer moral support to his Czechoslovak counterpart, Alexander Dubček. Although the Soviet Union largely tolerated Ceaușescu&#x27;s recalcitrance, his seeming independence from Moscow earned Romania maverick status within the Eastern Bloc.

All of Ceaușescu&#x27;s economic, foreign and demographic policies were meant to achieve his ultimate goal: turning Romania into one of the world&#x27;s great powers.

During the following years, Ceaușescu pursued an open policy towards the United States and Western Europe. Romania was the first Warsaw Pact country to recognize West Germany, the first to join the International Monetary Fund, and the first to receive a US president, Richard Nixon. In 1971, Romania became a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Romania and Yugoslavia were also the only Eastern European countries that entered into trade agreements with the European Economic Community before the fall of the Eastern Bloc.

A series of official visits to Western countries (including the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Spain and Australia) helped Ceaușescu to present himself as a reforming Communist, pursuing an independent foreign policy within the Soviet Bloc. He also became eager to be seen as an enlightened international statesman, able to mediate in international conflicts, and to gain international respect for Romania. Ceaușescu negotiated in international affairs, such as the opening of US relations with China in 1969 and the visit of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat to Israel in 1977. In addition, Romania was the only country in the world to maintain normal diplomatic relations with both Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. In 1980, Romania participated in the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow with its other Soviet bloc allies, but in 1984 was one of the few Communist countries to participate in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles (going on to win 53 medals, trailing only the United States and West Germany in the overall count) while most of the Eastern Bloc&#x27;s nations boycotted this event.
Ceaușescu refused to implement measures of economic liberalism. The evolution of his regime followed the path begun by Gheorghiu-Dej. He continued with the program of intensive industrialization aimed at the economic self-sufficiency of the country which since 1959 had already doubled industrial production and had reduced the peasant population from 78% at the end of the 1940s to 61% in 1966 and 49% by 1971. However, for Romania, like other Eastern People&#x27;s Republics, industrialization did not mean a total social break with the countryside. The peasants returned periodically to the villages or resided in them, commuting daily to the city in a practice called naveta. This allowed Romanians to act as peasants and workers at the same time.

Universities were also founded in small Romanian towns, which served to train qualified professionals such as engineers, economists, planners or jurists necessary for the industrialization and development project of the country. Romanian healthcare also achieved improvements and recognition by the World Health Organization (WHO). In May 1969, Marcolino Candau, Director General of this organization, visited Romania and declared that the visits of WHO staff to various Romanian hospital establishments had made an extraordinarily good impression.

The social and economic transformations resulted in improved living conditions for Romanians. Economic growth allowed for higher salaries which, combined with the benefits offered by the state (free medical care, pensions, free universal education at all levels, etc.) were a leap compared to the pre-WWII situation of the Romanian population. Certain extra retributions were allowed for the peasants, who started to produce more.

===Decree 770===

In October 1966, in an attempt to reverse the Romania&#x27;s low birth and fertility rates, Ceaușescu issued Decree 770 to restrict abortion and contraception. The government targeted rising divorce rates and made divorce more difficult – marriages could only be dissolved in exceptional cases. By the late 1960s, the population began to swell. In turn, a new problem was created, child abandonment, which swelled the orphanage population (see 1980s–1990s Romanian orphans phenomenon). Many of the children in these orphanages suffered mental and physical deficiencies (see Cighid).

Measures to encourage reproduction included financial motivations for families who bore children, guaranteed maternity leave, and childcare support for mothers who returned to work, work protection for women, and extensive access to medical control in all stages of pregnancy, as well as after it. Medical control was seen as one of the most productive effects of the law, since all women who became pregnant were under the care of a qualified medical practitioner, even in rural areas. In some cases, if a woman was unable to visit a medical office, a doctor would visit her home. Mothers of at least five children were entitled to receive significant benefits, while mothers of at least ten children were declared &quot;heroine mothers&quot; by the Romanian state.

===Speech of 21 August 1968===

Ceaușescu&#x27;s speech of 21 August 1968 represented the apogee of Ceaușescu&#x27;s rule. It marked the highest point in Ceaușescu&#x27;s popularity, when he openly condemned the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia.

===July Theses===

Ceaușescu visited China, North Korea, Mongolia and North Vietnam in 1971. He took great interest in the idea of total national transformation as embodied in the programmes of North Korea&#x27;s &quot;Juche&quot; and China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution. He was also inspired by the personality cults of North Korea&#x27;s Kim Il Sung and China&#x27;s Mao Zedong. Journalist Edward Behr claimed that Ceaușescu admired both Mao and Kim as leaders who not only totally dominated their nations but had also used totalitarian methods coupled with significant ultra-nationalism mixed in with communism in order to transform both China and North Korea into major world powers. Furthermore, that Kim and even more so Mao had broken free of Soviet control were additional sources of admiration for Ceaușescu. According to British journalist Edward Behr, Elena Ceaușescu allegedly bonded with Mao&#x27;s wife, Jiang Qing. Behr wrote that the possibility that what Ceaușescu had seen in both China and North Korea were &quot;vast Potemkin villages for the hoodwinking of gullible foreign guests&quot; was something that never seemed to have crossed his mind. Shortly after returning home, he began to emulate North Korea&#x27;s system. North Korean books on &quot;Juche&quot; were translated into Romanian and widely distributed inside the country.

On 6 July 1971, he delivered a speech before the executive committee of the Romanian Communist Party. This quasi-Maoist speech, which came to be known as the July Theses, contained seventeen proposals. Among these were: continuous growth in the &quot;leading role&quot; of the Party; improvement of Party education and of mass political action; youth participation on large construction projects as part of their &quot;patriotic work&quot;; an intensification of political-ideological education in schools and universities, as well as in children&#x27;s, youth and student organizations; and an expansion of political propaganda, orienting radio and television shows to this end, as well as publishing houses, theatres and cinemas, opera, ballet, artists&#x27; unions, promoting a &quot;militant, revolutionary&quot; character in artistic productions. The liberalization of 1965 was condemned and an index of banned books and authors was re-established.

The Theses heralded the beginning of a &quot;mini cultural revolution&quot; in Romania, launching a Neo-Stalinist offensive against cultural autonomy, reaffirming an ideological basis for literature that, in theory, the Party had hardly abandoned. Although presented in terms of &quot;Socialist Humanism&quot;, the Theses in fact marked a return to the strict guidelines of Socialist Realism and attacks on non-compliant intellectuals. Strict ideological conformity in the humanities and social sciences was demanded.

In a 1972 speech, Ceaușescu stated he wanted &quot;a certain blending of party and state activities ... in the long run we shall witness an ever closer blending of the activities of the party, state and other social bodies&quot;. In practice, a number of joint party-state organizations were founded such as the Council for Socialist Education and Culture, which had no precise counterpart in any of the other communist states of Eastern Europe, and the Romanian Communist Party was embedded into the daily life of the nation in a way that it never had been before. In 1974, the party programme of the Romanian Communist Party announced that structural changes in society were insufficient to create a full socialist consciousness in the people, and that a full socialist consciousness could only come about if the entire population was made aware of socialist values that guided society. The Communist Party was to be the agency that would so &quot;enlighten&quot; the population and in the words of the British historian Richard Crampton &quot;the party would merge state and society, the individual and the collective, and would promote &#x27;the ever more organic participation of party members in the entire social life.

=== President of the Socialist Republic of Romania ===

Ceaușescu had been head of state since 1967, though nominally only as first among equals, deriving his real power from his status as party leader. In 1974, Ceaușescu however introduced a full-fledged executive presidency as the nation&#x27;s top decision-maker. He was first elected to this post in 1974 and would be reelected every five years until 1989.

As President he was empowered to carry out those functions of the State Council that did not require plenums. He also appointed and dismissed the president of the Supreme Court and the prosecutor general whenever the legislature was not in session. In practice, from 1974 onward Ceaușescu frequently ruled by decree. Over time, he usurped many powers and functions that nominally were vested in the State Council as a whole.

Effectively, Ceaușescu now held all governing power in the nation; virtually all party and state institutions were subordinated to his will. The principles of democratic centralism, combined with the legislature&#x27;s infrequent sessions (it sat in full session only twice a year) meant that for all intents and purposes, his decisions had the force of law.

===Oil embargo, strike and foreign relations===

Starting with the 1973–74 Arab oil embargo against the West, a period of prolonged high oil prices set in that characterised the rest of the 1970s. Romania as a major oil equipment producer greatly benefited from the high oil prices of the 1970s, which led Ceaușescu to embark on an ambitious plan to invest heavily in oil-refining plants. Ceaușescu&#x27;s plan was to make Romania into Europe&#x27;s number one oil refiner not only of its own oil, but also of oil from Middle Eastern states such as Iraq and Iran, and then to sell all of the refined oil at a profit on the Rotterdam spot market. As Romania lacked the money to build the necessary oil refining plants and Ceaușescu chose to spend the windfall from the high oil prices on aid to the Third World in an attempt to buy Romania international influence, Ceaușescu borrowed heavily from Western banks on the assumption that when the loans came due, the profits from the sales of the refined oil would be more than enough to pay off the loans. The 1977 earthquake which destroyed much of Bucharest led to delays in the oil plan. By the time the oil refining plants were finished in the early 1980s, a slump in oil prices had set in, leading to major financial problems for Romania.
In August 1977 over 30,000 miners went on strike in the Jiu River valley complaining of low pay and poor working conditions. The Jiu valley miners&#x27; strike was the most significant expression of opposition to Ceaușescu&#x27;s rule prior to the late 1980s. The striking miners were inspired by similar strikes along Poland&#x27;s Baltic coast in December 1970, and just as in Poland in 1970, the striking Romanian miners demanded face-to-face negotiations with their nation&#x27;s leader. When Ceaușescu appeared before the miners on the third day of the strike, he was greeted (in the words of the British historian Richard Crampton) &quot;once again , with cries of &#x27;Down with the Red Bourgeoisie!. Ceaușescu ultimately negotiated a compromise solution to the strike. In the years after the strike, a number of its leaders died of accidents and &quot;premature disease&quot;. Rumors emerged that had doctors give the strike leaders 5-minute chest X-rays to ensure the development of cancer.
He continued to follow an independent policy in foreign relations—for example, in 1984, Romania was one of few communist states (notably including the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Yugoslavia) to take part in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, despite a Soviet-led boycott.
Also, the Socialist Republic of Romania was the first of the Eastern bloc nations to have official relations with the Western bloc and the European Community: an agreement including Romania in the Community&#x27;s Generalised System of Preferences was signed in 1974 and an Agreement on Industrial Products was signed in 1980. On 4 April 1975, Ceaușescu visited Japan and met with Emperor Hirohito. In June 1978, Ceaușescu made a state visit to the UK where a £200m licensing agreement was signed between the Romanian government and British Aerospace for the production of more than eighty BAC One-Eleven aircraft. The deal was said at the time to be the biggest between two countries involving a civil aircraft. This was the first state visit by a Communist head of state to the UK, and Ceaușescu was given a knighthood by the Queen, which was revoked on the day before his death in 1989. Similarly, in 1983, Vice President of the United States George H. W. Bush and in 1985 United States Secretary of State George Shultz also praised the Romanian dictator.

===Pacepa defection===
In 1978, Ion Mihai Pacepa, a senior member of the Romanian political police (Securitate, State Security), defected to the United States. A two-star general, he was the highest-ranking defector from the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War. His defection was a powerful blow against the administration, forcing Ceaușescu to overhaul Romania&#x27;s state security architecture. Pacepa&#x27;s 1986 book, &quot;Red Horizons: Chronicles of a Communist Spy Chief&quot; (), claimed to expose details of Ceaușescu&#x27;s government activities, such as massive spying on American industry and elaborate efforts to rally Western political support.

====Systematization: demolition and reconstruction====
Systematization () was the program of urban planning carried out under Ceaușescu&#x27;s regime. After a visit to North Korea in 1971, Ceaușescu was impressed by the &quot;Juche&quot; ideology of that country, and began a major campaign shortly afterwards.

Beginning in 1974, systematization consisted largely of the demolition and reconstruction of existing hamlets, villages, towns, and cities, in whole or in part, with the stated goal of turning Romania into a &quot;multilaterally developed socialist society&quot;. The policy largely consisted in the mass construction of high-density blocks of flats ().

During the 1980s, Ceaușescu became obsessed with building himself a palace of unprecedented proportions, along with an equally grandiose neighborhood, Centrul Civic, to accompany it. The mass demolitions that occurred in the 1980s under which an overall area of eight square kilometres of the historic center of Bucharest were leveled, including monasteries, churches, synagogues, a hospital, and a noted Art Deco sports stadium, in order to make way for the grandiose Centrul Civic (Civic center) and the House of the Republic, now officially renamed the Palace of Parliament, were the most extreme manifestation of the systematization policy.

In 1988, a massive rural resettlement program began.

===Foreign debt===

Ceaușescu&#x27;s political independence from the Soviet Union and his protest against the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 drew the interest of Western powers, whose governments briefly believed that he was an anti-Soviet maverick and hoped to create a schism in the Warsaw Pact by funding him. Ceaușescu did not realise that the funding was not always favorable. Ceaușescu was able to borrow heavily (more than $13 billion) from the West to finance economic development programs, but these loans ultimately devastated the country&#x27;s finances. He also secured a deal for cheap oil from Iran, but the deal fell through after the Shah was overthrown.

In an attempt to correct this, Ceaușescu decided to repay Romania&#x27;s foreign debts. He organised the 1986 military referendum and managed to change the constitution, adding a clause that barred Romania from taking foreign loans in the future. According to official results, the referendum yielded a nearly unanimous &quot;yes&quot; vote.

Romania&#x27;s record—having all of its debts to commercial banks paid off in full—has not been matched by any other heavily indebted country in the world. The policy to repay—and, in multiple cases, prepay—Romania&#x27;s external debt became the dominant policy in the late 1980s. The result was economic stagnation throughout the 1980s and, towards the end of the decade, an economic crisis. The country&#x27;s industrial capacity was eroded as equipment grew obsolete and energy intensity increased, and the standard of living deteriorated significantly. Draconian restrictions were imposed on household energy use to ensure adequate supplies for industry. Convertible currency exports were promoted at all costs and imports severely reduced. In 1988, real GDP contracted by 0.5%, mostly due to a decline in industrial output caused by significantly increased material costs. Despite the 1988 decline, the net foreign balance reached its decade-long peak (9.5% of GDP). In 1989, GDP slumped by a further 5.8% due to growing shortages and the increasingly obsolete capital stock. By March 1989, virtually all external debt had been repaid, including all medium- and long-term external debt. The remaining amount, totalling less than 1 million, consisted of short-term credits (mainly short-term export credits granted by Romania). A 1989 decree legally prohibited Romanian entities from contracting external debt. The CIA World Factbook edition of 1990 listed Romania&#x27;s external debt as &quot;none&quot; as of mid-1989.

====Yearly evolution (in billions of dollars)====
* 1995 was the last year in which Romania&#x27;s economy was dominated by the state. From 1996 onwards, the private sector would account for most of Romania&#x27;s GDP.
* Data for 1975, 1980 and 1982–1988 taken from the &quot;Statistical Abstract of the United States&quot;.
* Data for 1989–1995 provided by the OECD.
* Data for 1981 and 1985 provided by the &quot;World Book Year Book&quot;.
* By April 1989, with its debt virtually zero, Romania was a net external creditor. Foreign borrowing was resumed after December 1989. In order to maintain net creditor status, Romania had to keep its external debt under $2.5 billion, the low estimate of the amount it was owed by oil producers and other LDCs. This was first achieved in 1988 and continued through the early 1990s.

===1984 failed coup d&#x27;état attempt===
A tentative coup d&#x27;état planned in October 1984 failed when the military unit assigned to carry out the plan was sent to harvest maize instead.

=== 1987 Brașov rebellion ===
Romanian workers began to mobilize against the economic policies of Ceaușescu. Spontaneous labor conflicts, limited in scale, took place in major industrial centers such as Cluj-Napoca (November 1986) and the Nicolina platform in Iași (February 1987), culminating in a massive strike in Brașov. The draconian measures taken by Ceaușescu involved reducing energy and food consumption, as well as lowering workers&#x27; incomes, leading to what political scientist Vladimir Tismăneanu called &quot;generalized dissatisfaction&quot;.

Over 20,000 workers and a number of townspeople marched against economic policies in Socialist Romania and Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s policies of rationing of basic foodstuffs, rationing electricity and central heating.

The first protests began practically on 14 November 1987, at the 440 &quot;Molds&quot; Section of the Red Flag truck company. Initially, the protests were for basic needs: &quot;We want food and heating!&quot;, &quot;We want our money!&quot;, &quot;We want food for the children!&quot;, &quot;We want light and heat!&quot; and &quot;We want bread without a card!&quot;. Next to the County Hospital, they sang the anthem of the revolution of 1848, . Upon arriving in the city center, thousands of workers from the Tractorul Brașov and Hidromecanica factories, pupils, students, and others joined the demonstration. From this moment on, the protest became political. Participants later claimed to have chanted slogans such as &quot;Down with Ceaușescu!&quot;, &quot;Down with communism!&quot;, &quot;Down with the dictatorship!&quot; or &quot;Down with the tyrant!&quot;. During the march, members of the Securitate disguised as workers infiltrated the demonstrators, or remained on the sidelines as spectators, photographing or even filming.

By dusk, Securitate forces and the military surrounded the city center and disbanded the revolt by force. Some 300 protesters were arrested, and, in order to hide the political nature of the Brașov uprising, tried for disturbing the peace and &quot;outrage against morals&quot;.
Those under investigation were beaten and tortured, 61 receiving sentences ranging from 6 months to 3 years in prison, including sentences to be carried out working at various state enterprises across in the country. Although many previous party meetings had called for the death penalty to set an example, the regime was eager to downplay the uprising as &quot;isolated cases of hooliganism&quot;. Protesters were sentenced to deportation, with compulsory residence arranged in other cities, despite such measures having been repealed as far back as the late 1950s. The entire trial lasted only an hour and a half.

A few days after the workers&#x27; revolt, Cătălin Bia, a student at the Faculty of Forestry, sat in front of the canteen with a placard that read: &quot;The arrested workers must not die&quot;. He was joined by colleagues Lucian Silaghi and Horia Șerban. The three were arrested immediately. Subsequently, graffiti in solidarity with the workers&#x27; revolt appeared on the campus, and some students distributed manifestos. Security teams conducted a total of seven arrests. Those arrested were investigated, expelled from the faculty, returned to their home localities and placed under strict supervision, along with their families.

===Romani minority rights===
Under the Ceaușescu regime, Romani people in Romania were largely neglected. This can be seen, perhaps most blatantly, in a motion from the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers Party, which largely laid the foundation for the Ceaușescu regime&#x27;s policies regarding the rights of ethnic minorities. The motion entirely ignored the Romani.

The regime excluded the Romani from its list of &quot;co-inhabiting nationalities&quot;, preventing them from gaining any government representation as an ethnic group. Their exclusion continued even after increased representation of minorities such as Hungarians and Germans. Ceaușescu largely wished to ignore the living conditions of the Romani, who had suffered similar institutional neglect at the hands of his predecessors as far back as Ion Antonescu.

The Romani, long a highly vulnerable ethnic minority group across Europe, were left in significant poverty and at risk of hate crimes in the country. Such conditions exist in modern-day Romania, as demonstrated by the policies of several subsequent presidents.

==Revolution==
In November 1989, the XIVth Congress of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) saw Ceaușescu, then aged 71, re-elected for another five years as leader of the PCR. During the Congress, Ceaușescu made a speech denouncing the anti-Communist revolutions happening throughout the rest of Eastern Europe. The following month, Ceaușescu&#x27;s government itself collapsed after a series of violent events in Timișoara and Bucharest.

Czechoslovak President Gustáv Husák&#x27;s resignation on 10 December 1989 amounted to the fall of the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia, leaving Ceaușescu&#x27;s Romania as the only remaining hard-line Communist regime in the Warsaw Pact.

===Timișoara===
Demonstrations in the city of Timișoara were triggered by the government-sponsored attempt to evict László Tőkés, an ethnic Hungarian pastor, accused by the government of inciting ethnic hatred. Members of his ethnic Hungarian surrounded his apartment in a show of support.

Romanian students spontaneously joined the demonstration, which soon lost nearly all connection to its initial cause and became a more general anti-government demonstration. Regular military forces, police, and the Securitate fired on demonstrators on 17 December 1989, killing and injuring men, women, and children.

On 18 December 1989, Ceaușescu departed for a state visit to Iran, leaving the duty of crushing the Timișoara revolt to his subordinates and his wife. Upon his return to Romania on the evening of 20 December, the situation became even more tense, and he gave a televised speech from the TV studio inside the Central Committee Building (CC Building), in which he spoke about the events at Timișoara in terms of an &quot;interference of foreign forces in Romania&#x27;s internal affairs&quot; and an &quot;external aggression on Romania&#x27;s sovereignty&quot;.

The country, which had little to no information of the events transpiring in Timișoara from the national media, learned about the revolt from anti-communist radio stations that broadcast news in the Eastern Bloc throughout the Cold War (such as Voice of America and Radio Free Europe) and by word of mouth. On the next day, 21 December, Ceaușescu staged a mass meeting in Bucharest. Official media presented it as a &quot;spontaneous movement of support for Ceaușescu&quot;, emulating the 1968 meeting in which he had spoken against the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact forces.

===Overthrow===
====Speech on 21 December 1989====

The mass meeting of 21 December, held in what is now Revolution Square, began like many of Ceaușescu&#x27;s speeches over the years. He spoke of the achievements of the &quot;Socialist revolution&quot; and Romania&#x27;s &quot;multi-laterally developed Socialist society&quot;. He also blamed the Timișoara riots on &quot;fascist agitators who want to destroy socialism&quot;.

However, Ceaușescu had misjudged the crowd&#x27;s mood. Roughly eight minutes into his speech, several people began jeering and booing, and others began chanting &quot;Timișoara!&quot; He tried to silence them by raising his right hand and calling for the crowd&#x27;s attention before order was temporarily restored, then proceeded to announce social benefit reforms that included raising the national minimum wage by 200 lei per month to a total of 2,200 per month by 1 January. Images of Ceaușescu&#x27;s facial expression as the crowd began to boo and heckle him were among the most widely broadcast of the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe.

Failing to control the crowd, the Ceaușescus took cover inside the building that housed the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party. The rest of the day saw an open revolt of Bucharest&#x27;s population, which had assembled in University Square and confronted the police and army at barricades. The rioters, however, were no match for the military apparatus concentrated in Bucharest, which cleared the streets by midnight and arrested hundreds of people in the process.

====Flight on 22 December====
By the morning of 22 December, the rebellion had already spread to all major cities across the country. The suspicious death of Vasile Milea, Ceaușescu&#x27;s defence minister, later confirmed as a suicide (he had tried to incapacitate himself with a flesh wound but a bullet severed his artery), was announced by the media. Immediately thereafter, Ceaușescu presided over the CPEx (Political Executive Committee) meeting and assumed the leadership of the army. Believing that Milea had been murdered, rank-and-file soldiers switched sides to the revolution almost &quot;en masse&quot;. The commanders wrote off Ceaușescu as a lost cause and made no effort to keep their men loyal to the government. Ceaușescu made a last desperate attempt to address the crowd gathered in front of the Central Committee building, but the people in the square began throwing stones and other projectiles at him, forcing him to take refuge in the building once more. He, Elena and four others managed to get to the roof and escape by helicopter, only seconds ahead of a group of demonstrators who had followed them there. The Romanian Communist Party disappeared soon afterwards; unlike its kindred parties in the former Soviet bloc, it has never been revived.

The Western press published estimates of the number of people killed by Securitate forces. The count increased rapidly until an estimated 64,000 fatalities were reported across front pages. The Hungarian military attaché expressed doubt regarding these figures, pointing out the unfeasible logistics of killing such a large number of people in such a short period. After Ceaușescu&#x27;s death, hospitals across the country reported a death toll of fewer than 1,000, and probably much lower than that.

===Death===

Ceaușescu and his wife Elena fled the capital with Emil Bobu and Manea Mănescu and flew by helicopter to Ceaușescu&#x27;s Snagov residence, from which they fled again, this time to Târgoviște. They abandoned the helicopter near Târgoviște, having been ordered to land by the army, which by that time had restricted flying in Romania&#x27;s airspace. The Ceaușescus were held by the police while the policemen listened to the radio. They were eventually handed over to the army.

On Christmas Day, 25 December 1989, the Ceaușescus were tried before a court convened in a small room on orders of the National Salvation Front, Romania&#x27;s provisional government. They faced charges including illegal gathering of wealth and genocide. Ceaușescu repeatedly denied the court&#x27;s authority to try him, and asserted he was still legally the President of Romania. At the end of the trial, the Ceaușescus were found guilty and sentenced to death. A soldier standing guard in the proceedings was ordered to take the Ceaușescus outside one by one and shoot them, but the Ceaușescus demanded to die together. The soldiers agreed to this and began to tie their hands behind their backs, which the Ceaușescus protested against, but were powerless to prevent.

The Ceaușescus were executed by a group of soldiers: Captain Ionel Boeru, Sergeant-Major Georghin Octavian and Dorin-Marian Cîrlan, and five other non-commissioned officers who were recruited from twenty volunteers. Before his sentence was carried out, Nicolae Ceaușescu sang &quot;The Internationale&quot; whilst being led towards the wall. The firing squad began shooting as soon as the two were in their positions up against the wall.

Later that day, the execution was also shown on Romanian television. The hasty show trial and the images of the executed Ceaușescus were videotaped and the footage released in numerous Western countries two days after the execution.

The manner in which the trial was conducted has been criticised. However, Ion Iliescu, Romania&#x27;s provisional president, said in 2009 that the trial was &quot;quite shameful, but necessary&quot; in order to end the state of near-anarchy that had gripped the country in the three days since the Ceaușescus fled Bucharest. Similarly, Victor Stănculescu, who had been defence minister before going over to the revolution, said, in 2009, that the alternative would have been seeing the Ceaușescus lynched on the streets of Bucharest.

The Ceaușescus were the last people to be executed in Romania before the abolition of capital punishment on 7 January 1990.

Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu were originally buried in simple graves at Ghencea Cemetery, in Bucharest, on opposite sides of a path; their graves were often decorated with flowers and symbols of communist rule. In April 2007, their son, Valentin Ceaușescu, lost an appeal for an investigation into whether the graves were genuine. Upon his death in 1996, the younger son, Nicu, was buried nearby in the same cemetery. According to the &quot;Jurnalul Național&quot;, requests were made by the Ceaușescus&#x27; daughter, Zoia, and by supporters of their political views, to move their remains to mausoleums or to purpose-built churches. These demands were denied by the government.

====Exhumation and reburial====
On 21 July 2010, forensic scientists exhumed the bodies to perform DNA tests to prove conclusively that they were indeed the remains of the Ceaușescus. The body believed to be Elena&#x27;s had decayed too much to allow for a positive identification, but Nicolae was easily identifiable, wearing the bullet-riddled black winter coat he had been wearing during the execution. DNA tests were able to conclusively prove his identity. His family organised a funeral service for the couple, and they were reburied together at Ghencea under a tombstone.

==Ceaușescu&#x27;s policies==

A &quot;Romanian Encyclopedic Dictionary&quot; entry in 1978 underlines the concept as &quot;a new, superior, stage in the Socialist development of Romania ... begun by the 1971–1975 Five-Year Plan, prolonged over several [succeeding and projected] Five-Year Plans&quot;.

Ceaușism&#x27;s main trait was a form of Romanian nationalism, one which arguably propelled Ceaușescu to power in 1965, and probably led the Party leadership under Ion Gheorghe Maurer to select him over the more orthodox Gheorghe Apostol. Although he had previously been a careful supporter of the official lines, Ceaușescu came to embody Romanian society&#x27;s wish for independence after what many considered years of Soviet directives and purges, during and after the SovRom fiasco. He carried this nationalist option inside the Party, manipulating it against the nominated successor, Apostol. This nationalist policy had more timid precedents: for example, Gheorghiu-Dej had overseen the withdrawal of the Red Army in 1958.
It had also engineered the publishing of several works that subverted the Soviet image, no longer glossing over traditional points of tension with the Soviet Union. 

Ceaușescu was prepared to take a more decisive step in questioning Soviet policies. In the early years of his rule, he generally relaxed political pressures inside Romanian society, which led to the late 1960s and early 1970s being the most liberal decade in Socialist Romania. Gaining the public&#x27;s confidence, Ceaușescu took a clear stand against the 1968 crushing of the Prague Spring by Leonid Brezhnev. After a visit from Charles de Gaulle earlier in the same year, during which the French President gave recognition to the incipient maverick, Ceaușescu&#x27;s public speech in August deeply impressed the population, not only through its themes, but also because, uniquely, it was unscripted. He immediately attracted Western sympathies and backing, which lasted well beyond the &#x27;liberal&#x27; phase of his rule; at the same time, the period brought forward the threat of armed Soviet invasion: significantly, many young men inside Romania joined the &quot;Patriotic Guards&quot; created on the spur of the moment, in order to meet the perceived threat. President Richard Nixon was invited to Bucharest in 1969, which was the first visit of a United States president to a communist country after the start of the Cold War.

Alexander Dubček&#x27;s version of &quot;Socialism with a human face&quot; was never suited to Romanian Communist goals. Ceaușescu found himself briefly aligned with Dubček&#x27;s Czechoslovakia and Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Yugoslavia. The latter friendship was to last until Tito&#x27;s death in 1980, with Ceaușescu adapting the Titoist doctrine of &quot;independent Socialist development&quot; to suit his own objectives. Romania proclaimed itself a &quot;Socialist&quot; (in place of &quot;People&#x27;s&quot;) Republic to show that it was fulfilling Marxist goals without Moscow&#x27;s oversight, a move mirroring Communist Yugoslavia which renamed itself from a &quot;Federal People&#x27;s Republic&quot; to a &quot;Socialist Federal Republic&quot; a few years earlier.

The system&#x27;s nationalist traits grew and progressively blended with North Korean &quot;Juche&quot; and Chinese Maoist ideals. In 1971, the Party, which had already been completely purged of internal opposition (with the possible exception of Gheorghe Gaston Marin), approved the &quot;July Theses&quot;, expressing Ceaușescu&#x27;s disdain of Western models as a whole, and the reevaluation of the recent liberalisation as &quot;bourgeois&quot;. The 1974 XIth Party Congress tightened the Party&#x27;s grip on Romanian culture, guiding it towards Ceaușescu&#x27;s nationalist principles. Notably, it demanded that Romanian historians refer to Dacians as having &quot;an unorganised State&quot;, part of a political continuum that culminated in the Socialist Republic. The government continued its cultural dialogue with ancient forms, with Ceaușescu connecting his cult of personality to figures such as Mircea cel Bătrân (lit. &quot;Mircea the Elder&quot;, whom he styled &quot;Mircea the Great&quot;) and Mihai Viteazul (Michael the Brave). It also started adding Dacian or Roman versions to the names of cities and towns (&quot;Drobeta&quot; to Turnu Severin, &quot;Napoca&quot; to Cluj). Although Ceaușescu maintained an independent, &quot;national Communist&quot; course, his absolute control over the country, as well as the intensity of the personality cult surrounding him, led many non-Romanian observers to describe his rule as one of the closest things to an old-style Stalinist regime. The last edition of the Country Study on Romania, for instance, referred to the PCR&#x27;s &quot;Stalinist repression of individual liberties&quot;. A new generation of committed supporters on the outside confirmed the administration&#x27;s character. Ceaușescu probably never emphasized that his policies constituted a paradigm for theorists of National Bolshevism such as Jean-François Thiriart, but there was a publicised connection between him and Iosif Constantin Drăgan, an Iron Guardist Romanian-Italian émigré millionaire (Drăgan was already committed to a Dacianist and protochronist attitude that largely echoed the official cultural policy).

Nicolae Ceaușescu had a major influence on modern-day Romanian populist rhetoric. In his final years, he had begun to rehabilitate the image of pro-Nazi dictator Ion Antonescu. Although Antonescu&#x27;s image was never a fully official myth in Ceaușescu&#x27;s time, after his overthrow politicians such as Corneliu Vadim Tudor have coupled the images of the two leaders into their versions of a national Pantheon. The conflict with Hungary over the treatment of the Magyar minority in Romania had several unusual aspects: not only was it a vitriolic argument between two officially Socialist states, it also marked the moment when Hungary, a state behind the Iron Curtain, appealed to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe for sanctions to be taken against Romania. This meant that the later 1980s were marked by a pronounced anti-Hungarian discourse, which owed more to nationalist tradition than to Marxism, and the ultimate isolation of Romania on the world stage.

The strong opposition to Ceaușescu on all forms of &quot;perestroika&quot; and &quot;glasnost&quot; placed Ceaușescu at odds with Mikhail Gorbachev. He was very displeased when other Warsaw Pact countries decided to try their own versions of Gorbachev&#x27;s reforms. In particular, he was incensed when Poland&#x27;s leaders opted for a power-sharing arrangement with the Solidarity trade union. He even went as far as to call for a Warsaw Pact invasion of Poland—a significant reversal, considering how violently he had opposed the invasion of Czechoslovakia 20 years earlier. For his part, Gorbachev made no secret of his distaste for Ceaușescu, whom he called &quot;the Romanian führer&quot;. At a meeting between the two, Gorbachev upbraided Ceaușescu for his inflexible attitude. &quot;You are running a dictatorship here&quot;, the Soviet leader warned.

In November 1989, at the XIVth and last congress of the PCR, Ceaușescu condemned the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and asked for the annulment of its consequences. In effect, this amounted to a demand for the return of Bessarabia (most of which was then a Soviet republic and since 1991 has been independent Moldova) and northern Bukovina, both of which had been occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 and again at the end of World War II.

===Non-aligned policy feats===
Ceaușescu was among the most ardent supporters of dimming lingering tensions between different Balkan states, and went as far as to establish friendly relations with the vituperatively anti-communist Regime of the Colonels in Greece to pursue his objectives of cooperation between Balkan countries.

Ceaușescu&#x27;s Romania was the only Eastern Bloc country that retained diplomatic relations with Israel and did not sever diplomatic relations after Israel&#x27;s strike on Egypt at the start of the Six-Day War in 1967, to the consternation of the Soviet Union. Ceaușescu made efforts to act as a mediator between the PLO and Israel.

Similarly, Romania was the only Eastern Bloc country to attend the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, which had been boycotted by the Soviets and the rest of their allies in response to the U.S.-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.

Ceaușescu&#x27;s Romania was the only Warsaw Pact country that did not sever diplomatic relations with Chile after Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s coup.

Nicolae Ceaușescu was a close ally and personal friend of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaïre. Relations were in fact not just state-to-state, but party-to-party between their respective political machineries, the MPR and the PCR. Many believe that Ceaușescu&#x27;s death played a role in influencing Mobutu to &quot;democratise&quot; Zaïre in 1990.

Ceaușescu reduced the size of the Romanian People&#x27;s Army by 5%, for which he organized a mock referendum. In line with his policy of keeping a façade of &quot;popular democracy&quot;, he also ordered large rallies for peace to be held.

====Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic====
In August 1976, Nicolae Ceaușescu was the first high-level Romanian visitor to Moldavian SSR since World War II. In December 1976, at one of his meetings in Bucharest, Ivan Bodiul said that &quot;the good relationship was initiated by Ceaușescu&#x27;s visit to Soviet Moldova&quot;.

===Personality cult and totalitarianism===

Ceaușescu created a pervasive personality cult, giving himself such titles as &quot;Conducător&quot; (&quot;Leader&quot;) and &quot;Geniul din Carpați&quot; (&quot;The Genius of the Carpathians&quot;), with inspiration from Proletarian Culture (Proletkult). After his election as President of Romania, he even had a &quot;presidential sceptre&quot; created for himself, thus appropriating a royal insignia. This excess prompted painter Salvador Dalí to send a congratulatory telegram to the Romanian president, in which he sarcastically congratulated Ceaușescu on his &quot;introducing the presidential sceptre&quot;. The Communist Party daily &quot;Scînteia&quot; published the message, unaware that it was a work of satire.

The most important day of the year during Ceaușescu&#x27;s rule was his official birthday, 26 January—a day which saw Romanian media saturated with praise for him. According to historian Victor Sebestyen, it was one of the few days of the year when the average Romanian put on a happy face, since appearing miserable on this day was too risky to contemplate.

To lessen the chance of further treason after Pacepa&#x27;s defection, Ceaușescu also invested his wife Elena and other members of his family with important positions in the government. This led Romanians to joke that Ceaușescu was creating &quot;socialism in one family&quot;, a pun on &quot;socialism in one country&quot;.

Ceaușescu was greatly concerned about his public image. For years, nearly all official photographs of him showed him in his late 40s. Romanian state television was under strict orders to portray him in the best possible light. Additionally, producers had to take great care to make sure that Ceaușescu&#x27;s height (he was only tall) was never emphasized on screen. Consequences for breaking these rules were severe; one producer showed footage of Ceaușescu blinking and stuttering, and was banned for three months.

As part of a propaganda ploy arranged by the Ceaușescus through the consular cultural attachés of Romanian embassies, they managed to receive orders and titles from numerous states and institutions. France granted Nicolae Ceaușescu the Legion of Honour. In 1978 he became a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in the UK, a title of which he was stripped in 1989. Elena Ceaușescu was arranged to be &quot;elected&quot; to membership of a science academy in the US.

To execute a massive redevelopment project during the rule of Nicolae Ceaușescu, the government conducted extensive demolition of churches and many other historic structures in Romania. According to Alexandru Budistenu, former chief architect of Bucharest, &quot;The sight of a church bothered Ceaușescu. It didn&#x27;t matter if they demolished or moved it, as long as it was no longer in sight.&quot; Nevertheless, a project organized by Romanian engineer Eugeniu Iordachescu was able to move many historic structures to less-prominent sites and save them.

==== Ikea ====
In the 1980s under Nicolae Ceaușescu, Romania&#x27;s secret police the &#x27;Securitate&#x27; received six-figure payments from Ikea. According to declassified files at the National Council for the Study of the Securitate Archive, Ikea agreed to overcharge for products made in Romania and some of the overpayment funds were deposited into an account controlled by the Securitate.

==Legacy==
Ceaușescu had a mixed reputation among international leaders of his time. In his memoir &quot;The Artful Albanian&quot;, Albanian communist leader Enver Hoxha remarked &quot;As if Ceaușescu and company are to bring down imperialism! If the world waits for the Ceaușescus to do such a thing, imperialism will live for tens of thousands of years...&quot; According to Pacepa, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had an opposite interpretation, allegedly saying, &quot;My brother! You are my brother for the rest of my life!&quot;. Ceaușescu even received praise from anti-communists with the Shah (King) of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi acclaiming Ceaușescu leadership: &quot;I would like to salute [Ceaușescu&#x27;s] intransigent patriotism and ferocious will for independence. A veritable amity links me to him.&quot;

He directed the construction of the Palace of the Parliament in Bucharest, which broke ground in June 1984. It was previously called The House of the People and The People&#x27;s House. The building of the Palace of the Parliament was the most extreme expression of the systematization program imposed by Nicolae Ceaușescu upon Romania. Systematization was an urban planning program used to convert villages into miniature cities. The main architect of the building was Anca Petrescu (1949–2013), who began her work on the building when she was 28 years old. The building was completed in 1997, after Ceaușescu&#x27;s death in 1989. The Romanian Senate, which was originally housed in the former building of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party, has been headquartered in the Parliamentary Palace since 2004.

The Parliamentary Palace building has 1,100 rooms and is the largest civilian government building in the world as measured by volume in one continuous structure. (There are larger private sector buildings, mainly for the construction of aircraft, that have more continuous volume in one building, such as the Boeing Everett Factory.) Much of the building remains empty, being larger than the Parliament needs, though Parliament shares it with three museums and an international conference center. It is also the heaviest building in the world, being constructed of 700,000 tonnes of steel and bronze, a million square feet of marble, and large amounts of crystal and wood.
Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu had three children: Valentin Ceaușescu (born 1948), a nuclear physicist; Zoia Ceaușescu (1949–2006), a mathematician; and Nicu Ceaușescu (1951–1996), a physicist. After the death of his parents, Nicu Ceaușescu ordered the construction of an Orthodox church, the walls of which are decorated with portraits of his parents.

Praising the crimes of totalitarian governments and denigrating their victims is forbidden by law in Romania; this includes the Ceaușescu era. Dinel Staicu was fined 25,000 lei (approx. 9,000 United States dollars) for praising Ceaușescu and displaying his pictures on his private television channel (&quot;3TV Oltenia&quot;). 
Opinion polls held in 2010 indicated that 41% of Romanians would have voted for Ceaușescu if given the opportunity and 63% felt their lives were better before 1989. In 2014, the percentage of those who would vote for Ceaușescu reached 46%. On 27 December 2018, a poll found 64% of people had a good opinion of him.

==Cultural depictions==
Ceaușescu is played by Constantin Cojocaru in the 2011 Swiss docudrama &quot;Die letzten Tage der Ceaușescus&quot;.

The final song on the 2012 album Bish Bosch by Scott Walker titled “The Day The ‘Concudator’ Died (An Xmas Song)” is in reference to Ceaușescu (and his death on Christmas Day.)

A comedy musical enjoyed a world premiere at Seven Arts in Leeds on Sunday 21 May 2017. It was written by Tom Bailey and Greg Jameson, with songs by Allan Stelmach, and depicted Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu and their son Valentin in a piece of meta musical theatre that was also a comment upon celebrity culture and the role social media and political correctness play in creating social pariahs.

==Honours and awards==
Ceaușescu was made a knight of the Danish Order of the Elephant, but this appointment was revoked on 23 December 1989 by the then queen of Denmark, Margrethe II.

Ceaușescu was likewise stripped of his honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath (GCB) status by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom on the day before his execution. Queen Elizabeth II also returned the insignia of the Order of the Star of the Socialist Republic of Romania that Ceaușescu had bestowed upon her in 1978.

On his 70th birthday in 1988, Ceaușescu was decorated with the Karl-Marx-Order by then Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) chief Erich Honecker; through this he was honoured for his rejection of Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s reforms.

==In popular culture==
Two documentaries have been made about Ceaușescu in the 21st century. The first film was written and directed by Ben Lewis for the BBC, titled &quot;The King of Communism: The Pomp &amp; Pageantry of Nicolae Ceaușescu&quot; (2002).

The second, &quot;Autobiografia lui Nicolae Ceaușescu&quot; (2011), was created by Romanian writer/director Andrei Ujica, and an English language version of the film was released simultaneously, titled &quot;The Autobiography of Nicolae Ceaușescu&quot;.

The &quot;Left Behind&quot; novels of Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins prominently feature a fictional Romanian President named Nicolae Carpathia, whose cult of personality, strong-arm tactics, and name, are similar to those of Nicolae Ceaușescu.

<doc id="49565" wikidata="Q1140848" url="?curid=49565" title="President pro tempore of the United States Senate">
<text>The president pro tempore of the United States Senate (often shortened to president pro tem) is the second-highest-ranking official of the United States Senate, after the vice president. According to Article One, Section Three of the United States Constitution, the vice president of the United States is the president of the Senate (despite not being a senator), and the Senate must choose a president &quot;pro tempore&quot; to act in the vice president&#x27;s absence.

The president pro tempore is elected by the Senate as a whole, usually by a resolution which is adopted by unanimous consent without a formal vote. The Constitution does not specify who can serve in this position, but the Senate has always elected one of its current members. Unlike the vice president, the president pro tempore cannot cast a tie-breaking vote when the Senate is evenly divided. The president pro tempore has enjoyed many privileges and some limited powers.

During the vice president&#x27;s absence, the president pro tempore is empowered to preside over Senate sessions. Except when necessary or to highlight important votes, the vice president and the president pro tempore rarely preside; instead, the duty of presiding officer is rotated among junior U.S. senators of the majority party to give them experience in parliamentary procedure.

Since 1945, the most senior U.S. senator in the majority party has generally (though not always) been chosen to be president pro tempore and holds the office continuously until the election of another. Since the enactment of the current Presidential Succession Act in 1947, the president pro tempore is third in the presidential line of succession, after the vice president and the speaker of the House of Representatives. The current president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate is Chuck Grassley.

==Power and responsibilities==

Although the position is in some ways analogous to the speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the powers of the president pro tempore are far more limited. In the Senate, most power rests with the majority leader and other individual senators, but as the chamber&#x27;s presiding officer, the president pro tempore is authorized to perform certain duties in the absence of the vice president, including ruling on points of order. Additionally, under the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, the president pro tempore and the speaker are the two authorities to whom declarations must be transmitted that the president is unable to perform the duties of the office, or is able to resume doing so. The president pro tempore is third in the line of presidential succession, following the vice president and the speaker, and consequently is one of the few members of Congress entitled to a full-time security detail.

Additional duties include appointment of various congressional officers, certain commissions, advisory boards, and committees. The president pro tempore is the designated legal recipient of various reports to the Senate, including War Powers Act reports under which they, jointly with the speaker, may require the president to call Congress back into session. The officeholder is an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of various boards and commissions. With the secretary and sergeant at arms, the president pro tempore maintains order in Senate portions of the Capitol and Senate buildings.

==History==
===Position established===
The office of president pro tempore was established by the Constitution of the United States in 1789. Between 1792 and 1886, the president pro tempore was second in the line of presidential succession, following the vice president and preceding the speaker. Through 1891, the president pro tempore was appointed on an intermittent basis only, when the vice president was not present to preside over the Senate, or at the adjournment of a session of Congress. 

The first president pro tempore, John Langdon, was elected on April 6, 1789, serving four separate terms between 1789 and 1793. &quot;More than twelve senators held the office during the Senate&#x27;s first decade&quot;, presiding over sessions, signing legislation, and performing routine administrative tasks.

Whenever the office of the vice presidency was vacant, as it was on ten occasions between 1812 and 1889, the office garnered heightened importance, for although he did not assume the vice presidency, the president pro tempore stood next in line for the presidency. Before the ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967, a vacancy in the vice presidency could be filled only by a regular election; several individuals who served during these vacancies were referred to informally as &quot;acting vice president&quot;.
On three occasions during the 19th century, the Senate was without both a president and a president pro tempore:
* from July 9 to July 11, 1850, following Millard Fillmore&#x27;s accession to the presidency upon the death of Zachary Taylor, until William R. King was elected president pro tempore;
* from September 19 to October 10, 1881, following Chester Arthur&#x27;s accession to the presidency upon the death of James A. Garfield, until Thomas F. Bayard was elected president pro tempore;
* from November 25 to December 7, 1885, following the death of Vice President Thomas A. Hendricks, until John Sherman was elected president pro tempore.

When President Andrew Johnson, who had no vice president, was impeached and tried in 1868, Senate President pro tempore Benjamin Franklin Wade was next in line to the presidency. Wade&#x27;s radicalism is thought by many historians to be a major reason why the Senate, which did not want to see Wade in the White House, acquitted Johnson. 

Vice President Henry Wilson died on November 22, 1875. Senator Thomas W. Ferry, being President pro tempore of the Senate, was next in the line of presidential succession, and remained so until March 4, 1877. As acting president of the senate, he presided over the 1876 impeachment trial of U.S. Secretary of War William Belknap and the meetings of the Electoral Commission created by Congress to resolve the disputed 1876 presidential election. Still president pro tempore at that time, he would have temporally become the acting president had the Electoral College vote not been certified by March 4, 1877; Congress certified Rutherford B. Hayes as the winner of the Electoral College vote on March 2.

The president pro tempore and the speaker of the House were removed from the presidential line of succession in 1886. Both were restored to it in 1947, though this time with the president pro tempore following the speaker.

William P. Frye served as president pro tempore from 1896 to 1911 (the 54th through the 62nd Congresses), a tenure longer than anyone else. He resigned from the position due to ill health shortly before his death. Electing his successor proved difficult, as Senate Republicans, then in the majority, were split between progressive and conservative factions, each promoting its own candidate. Likewise, the Democrats proposed their own candidate. As a result of this three-way split, no individual received a majority vote. It took four months for a compromise solution to emerge: Democrat Augustus Bacon served for a single day, August 14, 1911, during the vice president&#x27;s absence. Thereafter, Bacon and four Republicans—Charles Curtis, Jacob Gallinger, Henry Cabot Lodge, and Frank Brandegee—alternated as president pro tempore for the remainder of that Congress&#x27;s session.

===Modern era===
In January 1945, the Senate elected Kenneth McKellar, who at the time was the senator with the longest continuous service, as its president pro tempore. Since then, it has become customary for the majority party&#x27;s most senior member to hold this position. Patty Murray was elected president pro tempore in January 2023, the first woman to hold the position. At the time of her election, she was the second-most senior member of the majority party.

Historically, presidents pro tempore would preside over any joint session of the United States Congress alongside the speaker of the house when there was a vacancy in the vice presidency. With the ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1967, vacancies in the vice presidency became much less common. However, a need for the president pro tempore to preside came in September 2001, following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Due to heightened security concerns during President George W. Bush&#x27;s September 20 address to Congress, Vice President Dick Cheney stayed at another location as a designated survivor, and President Pro Tempore Robert Byrd presided in his absence.

President pro tempore Patrick Leahy presided over the second impeachment of Donald Trump in 2021. The Chief Justice of the United States had presided over all previous presidential impeachment trials, as prescribed by the Constitution, but in this case Trump was no longer a sitting president when the trial began.

==Related officials==

===Acting president pro tempore===
While the president pro tempore does have other official duties, the holders of the office have, like the vice president, over time ceased presiding over the Senate on a daily basis, owing to the mundane and ceremonial nature of the position. Furthermore, as the president pro tempore is usually the most senior senator of the majority party, they most likely also chair a major Senate committee and have other significant demands on their time. Therefore, the president pro tempore has less time now than in the past to preside daily over the Senate. Instead, junior senators from the majority party are designated acting president pro tempore to preside over the Senate. This allows junior senators to learn proper parliamentary procedure. The acting president pro tempore is usually reappointed daily by the president pro tempore.

====Permanent acting president pro tempore====
In June 1963, because of the illness of president pro tempore Carl Hayden, Lee Metcalf was designated permanent acting president pro tempore. No term was imposed on this designation, so Metcalf retained it until he died in office in 1978.

===Deputy president pro tempore===
The ceremonial post of deputy president pro tempore was created for Hubert Humphrey, a former vice president, in 1977 following his losing bid to become the Senate majority leader. The Senate resolution creating the position stated that any former president or former vice president serving in the Senate would be entitled to this position. However, since Humphrey, none has served. George J. Mitchell was elected deputy president pro tempore in 1987, because of the illness of president pro tempore John C. Stennis, similar to Metcalf&#x27;s earlier designation as permanent acting president pro tempore. The office has remained vacant since 1989 and no senator other than Humphrey and Mitchell has held it since its creation.

===President pro tempore emeritus/emerita===

Since 2001, the honorary title of president pro tempore emeritus has been given to a senator of the minority party who has previously served as president pro tempore. It has been held by Strom Thurmond (R-South Carolina) (2001–2003), Robert Byrd (D-West Virginia) (2003–2007), Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) (2007–2009), Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) (2015–2021), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) (2021–2025), and Patty Murray (D-Washington) (2025–present). From 2009 to 2015, no senator met the requirements for it.

The position was created for Thurmond when the Democratic Party regained a majority in the Senate in June 2001. With the change in party control, Democrat Robert Byrd of West Virginia replaced Thurmond as president pro tempore, reclaiming a position he had previously held from 1989 to 1995 and briefly in January 2001. Thurmond&#x27;s retirement from the Senate on January 3, 2003, coincided with a change from Democratic to Republican control, making Stevens president pro tempore and Byrd the second president pro tempore emeritus. In 2007, Byrd returned as president pro tempore, and Stevens became the third president pro tempore emeritus, when the Democrats gained control of the Senate. Although a president pro tempore emeritus has no official duties, they are entitled to an increase in staff, and advise party leaders on the functions of the Senate.

The office&#x27;s accompanying budget increase was removed toward the end of the 113th Congress, shortly before Patrick Leahy was to become the first holder of the office in six years.
==Salary==
The salary of the president pro tempore for 2024 was $193,400, equal to that of the majority leaders and minority leaders of both houses of Congress. If there is a vacancy in the office of vice president, then the salary would be the same as that of the vice president. The salary alongside the salary of the members of Congress has not been adjusted since 2009.

<doc id="49569" wikidata="Q182505" url="?curid=49569" title="Bayes' theorem">
<text>Bayes&#x27; theorem (alternatively Bayes&#x27; law or Bayes&#x27; rule, after Thomas Bayes) gives a mathematical rule for inverting conditional probabilities, allowing one to find the probability of a cause given its effect. For example, if the risk of developing health problems is known to increase with age, Bayes&#x27; theorem allows the risk to someone of a known age to be assessed more accurately by conditioning it relative to their age, rather than assuming that the person is typical of the population as a whole. Based on Bayes&#x27; law, both the prevalence of a disease in a given population and the error rate of an infectious disease test must be taken into account to evaluate the meaning of a positive test result and avoid the &quot;base-rate fallacy&quot;.

One of Bayes&#x27; theorem&#x27;s many applications is Bayesian inference, an approach to statistical inference, where it is used to invert the probability of observations given a model configuration (i.e., the likelihood function) to obtain the probability of the model configuration given the observations (i.e., the posterior probability).

== History ==

Bayes&#x27; theorem is named after Thomas Bayes (), a minister, statistician, and philosopher. Bayes used conditional probability to provide an algorithm (his Proposition 9) that uses evidence to calculate limits on an unknown parameter. His work was published in 1763 as &quot;An Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances&quot;. Bayes studied how to compute a distribution for the probability parameter of a binomial distribution (in modern terminology). After Bayes&#x27;s death, his family gave his papers to a friend, the minister, philosopher, and mathematician Richard Price.

Price significantly edited the unpublished manuscript for two years before sending it to a friend who read it aloud at the Royal Society on 23 December 1763. Price edited Bayes&#x27;s major work &quot;An Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances&quot; (1763), which appeared in &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;, and contains Bayes&#x27; theorem. Price wrote an introduction to the paper that provides some of the philosophical basis of Bayesian statistics and chose one of the two solutions Bayes offered. In 1765, Price was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in recognition of his work on Bayes&#x27;s legacy. On 27 April, a letter sent to his friend Benjamin Franklin was read out at the Royal Society, and later published, in which Price applies this work to population and computing &#x27;life-annuities&#x27;.

Independently of Bayes, Pierre-Simon Laplace used conditional probability to formulate the relation of an updated posterior probability from a prior probability, given evidence. He reproduced and extended Bayes&#x27;s results in 1774, apparently unaware of Bayes&#x27;s work, and summarized his results in &quot;Théorie analytique des probabilités&quot; (1812). The Bayesian interpretation of probability was developed mainly by Laplace.

About 200 years later, Sir Harold Jeffreys put Bayes&#x27;s algorithm and Laplace&#x27;s formulation on an axiomatic basis, writing in a 1973 book that Bayes&#x27; theorem &quot;is to the theory of probability what the Pythagorean theorem is to geometry&quot;.

Stephen Stigler used a Bayesian argument to conclude that Bayes&#x27; theorem was discovered by Nicholas Saunderson, a blind English mathematician, some time before Bayes, but that is disputed. Martyn Hooper and Sharon McGrayne have argued that Richard Price&#x27;s contribution was substantial:
F. Thomas Bruss reviewed Bayes&#x27; work &quot;An essay towards solving a problem in the doctrine of chances&quot; as communicated by Price. He agrees with Stigler&#x27;s fine analysis in many points, but not as far as the question of priority is concerned. Bruss underlines the intuitive part of Bayes&#x27; formula and adds independent arguments of Bayes&#x27; probable motivation for his work. He concludes that, unless the contrary is really proven, we are entitled to be faithful to the name &quot;Bayes&#x27; Theorem&quot; or &quot;Bayes&#x27; formula&quot;.

==Statement of theorem==
Bayes&#x27; theorem is stated mathematically as the following equation:

where formula_1 and formula_2 are events and formula_3.

* formula_4 is a conditional probability: the probability of event formula_1 occurring given that formula_2 is true. It is also called the posterior probability of formula_1 given formula_2.
* formula_9 is also a conditional probability: the probability of event formula_2 occurring given that formula_1 is true. It can also be interpreted as the likelihood of formula_1 given a fixed formula_2 because formula_14.
* formula_15 and formula_16 are the probabilities of observing formula_1 and formula_2 respectively without any given conditions; they are known as the prior probability and marginal probability.

===Proof===
====For events====
Bayes&#x27; theorem may be derived from the definition of conditional probability:

:formula_19

where formula_20 is the probability of both A and B being true. Similarly,

:formula_21

Solving for formula_20 and substituting into the above expression for formula_4 yields Bayes&#x27; theorem:

:formula_24

====For continuous random variables====
For two continuous random variables &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, Bayes&#x27; theorem may be analogously derived from the definition of conditional density:

:formula_25
:formula_26

Therefore,

:formula_27

====General case====
Let formula_28 be the conditional distribution of formula_29 given formula_30 and let formula_31 be the distribution of formula_32. The joint distribution is then formula_33. The conditional distribution formula_34 of formula_32 given formula_36 is then determined by

formula_37

Existence and uniqueness of the needed conditional expectation is a consequence of the Radon–Nikodym theorem. This was formulated by Kolmogorov in 1933. Kolmogorov underlines the importance of conditional probability, writing, &quot;I wish to call attention to ... the theory of conditional probabilities and conditional expectations&quot;. Bayes&#x27; theorem determines the posterior distribution from the prior distribution. Uniqueness requires continuity assumptions. Bayes&#x27; theorem can be generalized to include improper prior distributions such as the uniform distribution on the real line. Modern Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have boosted the importance of Bayes&#x27; theorem, including in cases with improper priors.

==Examples==
===Recreational mathematics===
Bayes&#x27; rule and computing conditional probabilities provide a method to solve a number of popular puzzles, such as the Three Prisoners problem, the Monty Hall problem, the Two Child problem, and the Two Envelopes problem.

===Drug testing===
Suppose, a particular test for whether someone has been using cannabis is 90% sensitive, meaning the true positive rate (TPR) = 0.90. Therefore, it leads to 90% true positive results (correct identification of drug use) for cannabis users.

The test is also 80% specific, meaning true negative rate (TNR) = 0.80. Therefore, the test correctly identifies 80% of non-use for non-users, but also generates 20% false positives, or false positive rate (FPR) = 0.20, for non-users.

Assuming 0.05 prevalence, meaning 5% of people use cannabis, what is the probability that a random person who tests positive is really a cannabis user?

The Positive predictive value (PPV) of a test is the proportion of persons who are actually positive out of all those testing positive, and can be calculated from a sample as:
:PPV = True positive / Tested positive

If sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence are known, PPV can be calculated using Bayes&#x27; theorem. Let formula_38 mean &quot;the probability that someone is a cannabis user given that they test positive&quot;, which is what PPV means. We can write:

:formula_39

The denominator formula_40 is a direct application of the Law of Total Probability. In this case, it says that the probability that someone tests positive is the probability that a user tests positive times the probability of being a user, plus the probability that a non-user tests positive, times the probability of being a non-user. This is true because the classifications user and non-user form a partition of a set, namely the set of people who take the drug test. This combined with the definition of conditional probability results in the above statement.

In other words, if someone tests positive, the probability that they are a cannabis user is only 19%—because in this group, only 5% of people are users, and most positives are false positives coming from the remaining 95%.
If 1,000 people were tested:
* 950 are non-users and 190 of them give false positive (0.20 × 950) 
* 50 of them are users and 45 of them give true positive (0.90 × 50)

The 1,000 people thus have 235 positive tests, of which only 45 are genuine, about 19%.
====Sensitivity or specificity====
The importance of specificity can be seen by showing that even if sensitivity is raised to 100% and specificity remains at 80%, the probability that someone who tests positive is a cannabis user rises only from 19% to 21%, but if the sensitivity is held at 90% and the specificity is increased to 95%, the probability rises to 49%.

===Cancer rate===
If all patients with pancreatic cancer have a certain symptom, it does not follow that anyone who has that symptom has a 100% chance of getting pancreatic cancer. Assuming the incidence rate of pancreatic cancer is 1/100000, while 10/99999 healthy individuals have the same symptoms worldwide, the probability of having pancreatic cancer given the symptoms is 9.1%, and the other 90.9% could be &quot;false positives&quot; (that is, falsely said to have cancer; &quot;positive&quot; is a confusing term when, as here, the test gives bad news).

Based on incidence rate, the following table presents the corresponding numbers per 100,000 people.

Which can then be used to calculate the probability of having cancer when you have the symptoms: 
:formula_41

===Defective item rate===
A factory produces items using three machines—A, B, and C—which account for 20%, 30%, and 50% of its output, respectively. Of the items produced by machine A, 5% are defective, while 3% of B&#x27;s items and 1% of C&#x27;s are defective. If a randomly selected item is defective, what is the probability it was produced by machine C?

Once again, the answer can be reached without using the formula by applying the conditions to a hypothetical number of cases. For example, if the factory produces 1,000 items, 200 will be produced by A, 300 by B, and 500 by C. Machine A will produce 5% × 200 = 10 defective items, B 3% × 300 = 9, and C 1% × 500 = 5, for a total of 24. Thus 24/1000 (2.4%) of the total output will be defective and the likelihood that a randomly selected defective item was produced by machine C is 5/24 (~20.83%).

This problem can also be solved using Bayes&#x27; theorem: Let &quot;Xi&quot; denote the event that a randomly chosen item was made by the &quot;i&quot; th machine (for &quot;i&quot; = A,B,C). Let &quot;Y&quot; denote the event that a randomly chosen item is defective. Then, we are given the following information:
:formula_42
If the item was made by the first machine, then the probability that it is defective is 0.05; that is, &quot;P&quot;(&quot;Y&quot; | &quot;X&quot;A) = 0.05. Overall, we have

:formula_43

To answer the original question, we first find &quot;P&quot;(Y). That can be done in the following way:

:formula_44

Hence, 2.4% of the total output is defective.

We are given that &quot;Y&quot; has occurred and we want to calculate the conditional probability of &quot;X&quot;C. By Bayes&#x27; theorem,

:formula_45

Given that the item is defective, the probability that it was made by machine C is 5/24. C produces half of the total output but a much smaller fraction of the defective items. Hence the knowledge that the item selected was defective enables us to replace the prior probability &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;C) = 1/2 by the smaller posterior probability &quot;P&quot;(XC | &quot;Y&quot;) = 5/24.

==Interpretations==

The interpretation of Bayes&#x27; rule depends on the interpretation of probability ascribed to the terms. The two predominant interpretations are described below.

===Bayesian interpretation===
In the Bayesian (or epistemological) interpretation, probability measures a &quot;degree of belief&quot;. Bayes&#x27; theorem links the degree of belief in a proposition before and after accounting for evidence. For example, suppose it is believed with 50% certainty that a coin is twice as likely to land heads than tails. If the coin is flipped a number of times and the outcomes observed, that degree of belief will probably rise or fall, but might remain the same, depending on the results. For proposition &quot;A&quot; and evidence &quot;B&quot;,
* &quot;P&quot; (&quot;A&quot;), the &quot;prior&quot;, is the initial degree of belief in &quot;A&quot;.
* &quot;P&quot; (&quot;A&quot; | &quot;B&quot;), the &quot;posterior&quot;, is the degree of belief after incorporating news that &quot;B&quot; is true.
* the quotient represents the support &quot;B&quot; provides for &quot;A&quot;.

For more on the application of Bayes&#x27; theorem under the Bayesian interpretation of probability, see Bayesian inference.

===Frequentist interpretation===
In the frequentist interpretation, probability measures a &quot;proportion of outcomes&quot;. For example, suppose an experiment is performed many times. &quot;P&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is the proportion of outcomes with property &quot;A&quot; (the prior) and &quot;P&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) is the proportion with property &quot;B&quot;. &quot;P&quot;(&quot;B&quot; | &quot;A&quot;) is the proportion of outcomes with property &quot;B&quot; &quot;out of&quot; outcomes with property &quot;A&quot;, and &quot;P&quot;(&quot;A&quot; | &quot;B&quot;) is the proportion of those with &quot;A&quot; &quot;out of&quot; those with &quot;B&quot; (the posterior).

The role of Bayes&#x27; theorem can be shown with tree diagrams. The two diagrams partition the same outcomes by &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; in opposite orders, to obtain the inverse probabilities. Bayes&#x27; theorem links the different partitionings.

====Example====
An entomologist spots what might, due to the pattern on its back, be a rare subspecies of beetle. A full 98% of the members of the rare subspecies have the pattern, so &quot;P&quot;(Pattern | Rare) = 98%. Only 5% of members of the common subspecies have the pattern. The rare subspecies is 0.1% of the total population. How likely is the beetle having the pattern to be rare: what is &quot;P&quot;(Rare | Pattern)?

From the extended form of Bayes&#x27; theorem (since any beetle is either rare or common),

: formula_46

==Forms==

===Events===

====Simple form====
For events &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, provided that &quot;P&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) ≠ 0,

:formula_47

In many applications, for instance in Bayesian inference, the event &quot;B&quot; is fixed in the discussion and we wish to consider the effect of its having been observed on our belief in various possible events &quot;A&quot;. In such situations the denominator of the last expression, the probability of the given evidence &quot;B&quot;, is fixed; what we want to vary is &quot;A&quot;. Bayes&#x27; theorem shows that the posterior probabilities are proportional to the numerator, so the last equation becomes:

:formula_48

In words, the posterior is proportional to the prior times the likelihood.

If events &quot;A&quot;1, &quot;A&quot;2, ..., are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, i.e., one of them is certain to occur but no two can occur together, we can determine the proportionality constant by using the fact that their probabilities must add up to one. For instance, for a given event &quot;A&quot;, the event &quot;A&quot; itself and its complement ¬&quot;A&quot; are exclusive and exhaustive. Denoting the constant of proportionality by &quot;c&quot;, we have:

:formula_49

Adding these two formulas we deduce that:

:formula_50

or

:formula_51

====Alternative form====
Another form of Bayes&#x27; theorem for two competing statements or hypotheses is:

:formula_52

For an epistemological interpretation:

For proposition &quot;A&quot; and evidence or background &quot;B&quot;,

* formula_15 is the prior probability, the initial degree of belief in &quot;A&quot;.
* formula_54 is the corresponding initial degree of belief in &quot;not-A&quot;, that &quot;A&quot; is false, where formula_55
* formula_56 is the conditional probability or likelihood, the degree of belief in &quot;B&quot; given that &quot;A&quot; is true.
* formula_57 is the conditional probability or likelihood, the degree of belief in &quot;B&quot; given that &quot;A&quot; is false.
* formula_58 is the posterior probability, the probability of &quot;A&quot; after taking into account &quot;B&quot;.

====Extended form====
Often, for some partition {&quot;Aj&quot;} of the sample space, the event space is given in terms of &quot;P&quot;(&quot;Aj&quot;) and &quot;P&quot;(&quot;B&quot; | &quot;Aj&quot;). It is then useful to compute &quot;P&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) using the law of total probability:

formula_59

Or (using the multiplication rule for conditional probability),

:formula_60
:formula_61

In the special case where &quot;A&quot; is a binary variable:

:formula_62

===Random variables===

Consider a sample space Ω generated by two random variables &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; with known probability distributions. In principle, Bayes&#x27; theorem applies to the events &quot;A&quot; = {&quot;X&quot; = &quot;x&quot;} and &quot;B&quot; = {&quot;Y&quot; = &quot;y&quot;}.

:formula_63

Terms become 0 at points where either variable has finite probability density. To remain useful, Bayes&#x27; theorem can be formulated in terms of the relevant densities (see Derivation).

====Simple form====
If &quot;X&quot; is continuous and &quot;Y&quot; is discrete,

:formula_64

where each formula_65 is a density function.

If &quot;X&quot; is discrete and &quot;Y&quot; is continuous,

:formula_66

If both &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are continuous,

:formula_67

====Extended form====
A continuous event space is often conceptualized in terms of the numerator terms. It is then useful to eliminate the denominator using the law of total probability. For &quot;fY&quot;(&quot;y&quot;), this becomes an integral:

:formula_68

=== Bayes&#x27; rule in odds form ===
Bayes&#x27; theorem in odds form is:

:formula_69

where

:formula_70

is called the Bayes factor or likelihood ratio. The odds between two events is simply the ratio of the probabilities of the two events. Thus:

:formula_71

:formula_72

Thus the rule says that the posterior odds are the prior odds times the Bayes factor; in other words, the posterior is proportional to the prior times the likelihood.

In the special case that formula_73 and formula_74, one writes formula_75, and uses a similar abbreviation for the Bayes factor and for the conditional odds. The odds on formula_1 is by definition the odds for and against formula_1. Bayes&#x27; rule can then be written in the abbreviated form

:formula_78

or, in words, the posterior odds on formula_1 equals the prior odds on formula_1 times the likelihood ratio for formula_1 given information formula_2. In short, posterior odds equals prior odds times likelihood ratio.

For example, if a medical test has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 91%, then the positive Bayes factor is formula_83. Now, if the prevalence of this disease is 9.09%, and if we take that as the prior probability, then the prior odds is about 1:10. So after receiving a positive test result, the posterior odds of having the disease becomes 1:1, which means that the posterior probability of having the disease is 50%. If a second test is performed in serial testing, and that also turns out to be positive, then the posterior odds of having the disease becomes 10:1, which means a posterior probability of about 90.91%. The negative Bayes factor can be calculated to be 91%/(100%-90%)=9.1, so if the second test turns out to be negative, then the posterior odds of having the disease is 1:9.1, which means a posterior probability of about 9.9%.

The example above can also be understood with more solid numbers: assume the patient taking the test is from a group of 1,000 people, 91 of whom have the disease (prevalence of 9.1%). If all 1,000 take the test, 82 of those with the disease will get a true positive result (sensitivity of 90.1%), 9 of those with the disease will get a false negative result (false negative rate of 9.9%), 827 of those without the disease will get a true negative result (specificity of 91.0%), and 82 of those without the disease will get a false positive result (false positive rate of 9.0%). Before taking any test, the patient&#x27;s odds for having the disease is 91:909. After receiving a positive result, the patient&#x27;s odds for having the disease is

:formula_84
which is consistent with the fact that there are 82 true positives and 82 false positives in the group of 1,000.

==Correspondence to other mathematical frameworks==

===Propositional logic===
Where the conditional probability formula_85 is defined, it can be seen to capture the implication formula_86. The probabilistic calculus then mirrors or even generalizes various logical inference rules. Beyond, for example, assigning binary truth values, here one assigns probability values to statements. The assertion formula_86 is captured by the assertion formula_88, i.e. that the conditional probability take the extremal probability value formula_89. Likewise, the assertion of a negation of an implication is captured by the assignment of formula_90. So, for example, if formula_91, then (if it is defined) formula_88, which entails formula_93, the implication introduction in logic.

Similarly, as the product of two probabilities equaling formula_89 necessitates that both factors are also formula_89, one finds that Bayes&#x27; theorem
:formula_96
entails formula_97, which now also includes modus ponens.

For positive values formula_15, if it equals formula_16, then the two conditional probabilities are equal as well, and vice versa. Note that this mirrors the generally valid formula_100.

On the other hand, reasoning about either of the probabilities equalling formula_90 classically entails the following contrapositive form of the above: formula_102.

Bayes&#x27; theorem with negated formula_1 gives
:formula_104.
Ruling out the extremal case formula_105 (i.e. formula_106), one has formula_107 and in particular
:formula_108.
Ruling out also the extremal case formula_109, one finds they attain the maximum formula_89 simultaneously:
:formula_111
which (at least when having ruled out explosive antecedents) captures the classical contraposition principle
:formula_112.

===Subjective logic===
Bayes&#x27; theorem represents a special case of deriving inverted conditional opinions in subjective logic expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;(\omega^S_{A\tilde
After carrying out the same analysis on the patient&#x27;s male partner (with a negative test result), the chance that their child is affected is the product of the parents&#x27; respective posterior probabilities for being carriers times the chance that two carriers will produce an affected offspring ().

=== Genetic testing done in parallel with other risk factor identification ===
Bayesian analysis can be done using phenotypic information associated with a genetic condition. When combined with genetic testing, this analysis becomes much more complicated. Cystic fibrosis, for example, can be identified in a fetus with an ultrasound looking for an echogenic bowel, one that appears brighter than normal on a scan. This is not a foolproof test, as an echogenic bowel can be present in a perfectly healthy fetus. Parental genetic testing is very influential in this case, where a phenotypic facet can be overly influential in probability calculation. In the case of a fetus with an echogenic bowel, with a mother who has been tested and is known to be a CF carrier, the posterior probability that the fetus has the disease is very high (0.64). But once the father has tested negative for CF, the posterior probability drops significantly (to 0.16).

Risk factor calculation is a powerful tool in genetic counseling and reproductive planning but cannot be treated as the only important factor. As above, incomplete testing can yield falsely high probability of carrier status, and testing can be financially inaccessible or unfeasible when a parent is not present.

<text>Bayesian inference ( or ) is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes&#x27; theorem is used to calculate a probability of a hypothesis, given prior evidence, and update it as more information becomes available. Fundamentally, Bayesian inference uses a prior distribution to estimate posterior probabilities. Bayesian inference is an important technique in statistics, and especially in mathematical statistics. Bayesian updating is particularly important in the dynamic analysis of a sequence of data. Bayesian inference has found application in a wide range of activities, including science, engineering, philosophy, medicine, sport, and law. In the philosophy of decision theory, Bayesian inference is closely related to subjective probability, often called &quot;Bayesian probability&quot;.
==Introduction to Bayes&#x27; rule==


===Formal explanation===

Bayesian inference derives the posterior probability as a consequence of two antecedents: a prior probability and a &quot;likelihood function&quot; derived from a statistical model for the observed data. Bayesian inference computes the posterior probability according to Bayes&#x27; theorem:
formula_1
where
* stands for any &quot;hypothesis&quot; whose probability may be affected by data (called &quot;evidence&quot; below). Often there are competing hypotheses, and the task is to determine which is the most probable.
* formula_2, the &quot;prior probability&quot;, is the estimate of the probability of the hypothesis &quot;before&quot; the data , the current evidence, is observed.
* , the &quot;evidence&quot;, corresponds to new data that were not used in computing the prior probability.
* formula_3, the &quot;posterior probability&quot;, is the probability of &quot;given&quot; , i.e., &quot;after&quot; is observed. This is what we want to know: the probability of a hypothesis &quot;given&quot; the observed evidence.
* formula_4 is the probability of observing &quot;given&quot; and is called the &quot;likelihood&quot;. As a function of with fixed, it indicates the compatibility of the evidence with the given hypothesis. The likelihood function is a function of the evidence, , while the posterior probability is a function of the hypothesis, .
* formula_5 is sometimes termed the marginal likelihood or &quot;model evidence&quot;. This factor is the same for all possible hypotheses being considered (as is evident from the fact that the hypothesis does not appear anywhere in the symbol, unlike for all the other factors) and hence does not factor into determining the relative probabilities of different hypotheses.
*formula_6 (Else one has formula_7.)

For different values of , only the factors formula_2 and formula_4, both in the numerator, affect the value of formula_3 the posterior probability of a hypothesis is proportional to its prior probability (its inherent likeliness) and the newly acquired likelihood (its compatibility with the new observed evidence).

In cases where formula_11 (&quot;not &quot;), the logical negation of , is a valid likelihood, Bayes&#x27; rule can be rewritten as follows:
formula_12
because
formula_13
and
formula_14 This focuses attention on the term formula_15 If that term is approximately 1, then the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence, formula_16, is about formula_17, about 50% likely - equally likely or not likely. If that term is very small, close to zero, then the probability of the hypothesis, given the evidence, formula_16 is close to 1 or the conditional hypothesis is quite likely. If that term is very large, much larger than 1, then the hypothesis, given the evidence, is quite unlikely. If the hypothesis (without consideration of evidence) is unlikely, then formula_2 is small (but not necessarily astronomically small) and formula_20 is much larger than 1 and this term can be approximated as formula_21 and relevant probabilities can be compared directly to each other.

One quick and easy way to remember the equation would be to use rule of multiplication:
formula_22

===Alternatives to Bayesian updating===
Bayesian updating is widely used and computationally convenient. However, it is not the only updating rule that might be considered rational.

Ian Hacking noted that traditional &quot;Dutch book&quot; arguments did not specify Bayesian updating: they left open the possibility that non-Bayesian updating rules could avoid Dutch books. Hacking wrote: &quot;And neither the Dutch book argument nor any other in the personalist arsenal of proofs of the probability axioms entails the dynamic assumption. Not one entails Bayesianism. So the personalist requires the dynamic assumption to be Bayesian. It is true that in consistency a personalist could abandon the Bayesian model of learning from experience. Salt could lose its savour.&quot;

Indeed, there are non-Bayesian updating rules that also avoid Dutch books (as discussed in the literature on &quot;probability kinematics&quot;) following the publication of Richard C. Jeffrey&#x27;s rule, which applies Bayes&#x27; rule to the case where the evidence itself is assigned a probability. The additional hypotheses needed to uniquely require Bayesian updating have been deemed to be substantial, complicated, and unsatisfactory.

==Inference over exclusive and exhaustive possibilities==
If evidence is simultaneously used to update belief over a set of exclusive and exhaustive propositions, Bayesian inference may be thought of as acting on this belief distribution as a whole.

===General formulation===

Suppose a process is generating independent and identically distributed events formula_23, but the probability distribution is unknown. Let the event space formula_24 represent the current state of belief for this process. Each model is represented by event formula_25. The conditional probabilities formula_26 are specified to define the models. formula_27 is the degree of belief in formula_25. Before the first inference step, formula_29 is a set of &quot;initial prior probabilities&quot;. These must sum to 1, but are otherwise arbitrary.

Suppose that the process is observed to generate formula_30. For each formula_31, the prior formula_32 is updated to the posterior formula_33. From Bayes&#x27; theorem:

formula_34

Upon observation of further evidence, this procedure may be repeated.

===Multiple observations===

For a sequence of independent and identically distributed observations formula_35, it can be shown by induction that repeated application of the above is equivalent to
formula_36
where
formula_37
===Parametric formulation: motivating the formal description===

By parameterizing the space of models, the belief in all models may be updated in a single step. The distribution of belief over the model space may then be thought of as a distribution of belief over the parameter space. The distributions in this section are expressed as continuous, represented by probability densities, as this is the usual situation. The technique is, however, equally applicable to discrete distributions.

Let the vector formula_38 span the parameter space. Let the initial prior distribution over formula_38 be formula_40, where formula_41 is a set of parameters to the prior itself, or &quot;hyperparameters&quot;. Let formula_35 be a sequence of independent and identically distributed event observations, where all formula_43 are distributed as formula_44 for some formula_38. Bayes&#x27; theorem is applied to find the posterior distribution over formula_38:

formula_47
where
formula_48

==Formal description of Bayesian inference==

===Definitions===
*formula_49, a data point in general. This may in fact be a vector of values.
*formula_50, the parameter of the data point&#x27;s distribution, i.e., This may be a vector of parameters.
*formula_51, the hyperparameter of the parameter distribution, i.e., This may be a vector of hyperparameters.
*formula_52 is the sample, a set of formula_53 observed data points, i.e., formula_54.
*formula_55, a new data point whose distribution is to be predicted.

===Bayesian inference===

*The prior distribution is the distribution of the parameter(s) before any data is observed, i.e. formula_56 . The prior distribution might not be easily determined; in such a case, one possibility may be to use the Jeffreys prior to obtain a prior distribution before updating it with newer observations.
*The sampling distribution is the distribution of the observed data conditional on its parameters, i.e. This is also termed the likelihood, especially when viewed as a function of the parameter(s), sometimes written formula_57.
*The marginal likelihood (sometimes also termed the &quot;evidence&quot;) is the distribution of the observed data marginalized over the parameter(s), i.e. formula_58 It quantifies the agreement between data and expert opinion, in a geometric sense that can be made precise. If the marginal likelihood is 0 then there is no agreement between the data and expert opinion and Bayes&#x27; rule cannot be applied.
*The posterior distribution is the distribution of the parameter(s) after taking into account the observed data. This is determined by Bayes&#x27; rule, which forms the heart of Bayesian inference: formula_59 This is expressed in words as &quot;posterior is proportional to likelihood times prior&quot;, or sometimes as &quot;posterior = likelihood times prior, over evidence&quot;.
* In practice, for almost all complex Bayesian models used in machine learning, the posterior distribution formula_60 is not obtained in a closed form distribution, mainly because the parameter space for formula_50 can be very high, or the Bayesian model retains certain hierarchical structure formulated from the observations formula_52 and parameter formula_50. In such situations, we need to resort to approximation techniques.
* General case: Let formula_64 be the conditional distribution of formula_65 given formula_66 and let formula_67 be the distribution of formula_68. The joint distribution is then formula_69. The conditional distribution formula_70 of formula_68 given formula_72 is then determined by
formula_73Existence and uniqueness of the needed conditional expectation is a consequence of the Radon–Nikodym theorem. This was formulated by Kolmogorov in his famous book from 1933. Kolmogorov underlines the importance of conditional probability by writing &quot;I wish to call attention to ... and especially the theory of conditional probabilities and conditional expectations ...&quot; in the Preface. The Bayes theorem determines the posterior distribution from the prior distribution. Uniqueness requires continuity assumptions. Bayes&#x27; theorem can be generalized to include improper prior distributions such as the uniform distribution on the real line. Modern Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have boosted the importance of Bayes&#x27; theorem including cases with improper priors.

===Bayesian prediction===

*The posterior predictive distribution is the distribution of a new data point, marginalized over the posterior: formula_74
*The prior predictive distribution is the distribution of a new data point, marginalized over the prior: formula_75

Bayesian theory calls for the use of the posterior predictive distribution to do predictive inference, i.e., to predict the distribution of a new, unobserved data point. That is, instead of a fixed point as a prediction, a distribution over possible points is returned. Only this way is the entire posterior distribution of the parameter(s) used. By comparison, prediction in frequentist statistics often involves finding an optimum point estimate of the parameter(s)—e.g., by maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP)—and then plugging this estimate into the formula for the distribution of a data point. This has the disadvantage that it does not account for any uncertainty in the value of the parameter, and hence will underestimate the variance of the predictive distribution.

In some instances, frequentist statistics can work around this problem. For example, confidence intervals and prediction intervals in frequentist statistics when constructed from a normal distribution with unknown mean and variance are constructed using a Student&#x27;s t-distribution. This correctly estimates the variance, due to the facts that (1) the average of normally distributed random variables is also normally distributed, and (2) the predictive distribution of a normally distributed data point with unknown mean and variance, using conjugate or uninformative priors, has a Student&#x27;s t-distribution. In Bayesian statistics, however, the posterior predictive distribution can always be determined exactly—or at least to an arbitrary level of precision when numerical methods are used.

Both types of predictive distributions have the form of a compound probability distribution (as does the marginal likelihood). In fact, if the prior distribution is a conjugate prior, such that the prior and posterior distributions come from the same family, it can be seen that both prior and posterior predictive distributions also come from the same family of compound distributions. The only difference is that the posterior predictive distribution uses the updated values of the hyperparameters (applying the Bayesian update rules given in the conjugate prior article), while the prior predictive distribution uses the values of the hyperparameters that appear in the prior distribution.

==Mathematical properties==
===Interpretation of factor===

formula_76. That is, if the model were true, the evidence would be more likely than is predicted by the current state of belief. The reverse applies for a decrease in belief. If the belief does not change, formula_77. That is, the evidence is independent of the model. If the model were true, the evidence would be exactly as likely as predicted by the current state of belief.

===Cromwell&#x27;s rule===

If formula_78 then formula_79. If formula_80 and formula_81, then formula_82. This can be interpreted to mean that hard convictions are insensitive to counter-evidence.

The former follows directly from Bayes&#x27; theorem. The latter can be derived by applying the first rule to the event &quot;not formula_83&quot; in place of &quot;formula_83&quot;, yielding &quot;if formula_85, then formula_86&quot;, from which the result immediately follows.

===Asymptotic behaviour of posterior===

Consider the behaviour of a belief distribution as it is updated a large number of times with independent and identically distributed trials. For sufficiently nice prior probabilities, the Bernstein-von Mises theorem gives that in the limit of infinite trials, the posterior converges to a Gaussian distribution independent of the initial prior under some conditions firstly outlined and rigorously proven by Joseph L. Doob in 1948, namely if the random variable in consideration has a finite probability space. The more general results were obtained later by the statistician David A. Freedman who published in two seminal research papers in 1963 and 1965 when and under what circumstances the asymptotic behaviour of posterior is guaranteed. His 1963 paper treats, like Doob (1949), the finite case and comes to a satisfactory conclusion. However, if the random variable has an infinite but countable probability space (i.e., corresponding to a die with infinite many faces) the 1965 paper demonstrates that for a dense subset of priors the Bernstein-von Mises theorem is not applicable. In this case there is almost surely no asymptotic convergence. Later in the 1980s and 1990s Freedman and Persi Diaconis continued to work on the case of infinite countable probability spaces. To summarise, there may be insufficient trials to suppress the effects of the initial choice, and especially for large (but finite) systems the convergence might be very slow.

===Conjugate priors===
In parameterized form, the prior distribution is often assumed to come from a family of distributions called conjugate priors. The usefulness of a conjugate prior is that the corresponding posterior distribution will be in the same family, and the calculation may be expressed in closed form.

===Estimates of parameters and predictions===
It is often desired to use a posterior distribution to estimate a parameter or variable. Several methods of Bayesian estimation select measurements of central tendency from the posterior distribution.

For one-dimensional problems, a unique median exists for practical continuous problems. The posterior median is attractive as a robust estimator.

If there exists a finite mean for the posterior distribution, then the posterior mean is a method of estimation.
formula_87

Taking a value with the greatest probability defines maximum &quot;a posteriori&quot; (MAP) estimates:
formula_88

There are examples where no maximum is attained, in which case the set of MAP estimates is empty.

There are other methods of estimation that minimize the posterior &quot;risk&quot; (expected-posterior loss) with respect to a loss function, and these are of interest to statistical decision theory using the sampling distribution (&quot;frequentist statistics&quot;).

The posterior predictive distribution of a new observation formula_55 (that is independent of previous observations) is determined by
formula_90

==Examples==

===Probability of a hypothesis===

Suppose there are two full bowls of cookies. Bowl #1 has 10 chocolate chip and 30 plain cookies, while bowl #2 has 20 of each. Our friend Fred picks a bowl at random, and then picks a cookie at random. We may assume there is no reason to believe Fred treats one bowl differently from another, likewise for the cookies. The cookie turns out to be a plain one. How probable is it that Fred picked it out of bowl #1?

Intuitively, it seems clear that the answer should be more than a half, since there are more plain cookies in bowl #1. The precise answer is given by Bayes&#x27; theorem. Let formula_91 correspond to bowl #1, and formula_92 to bowl #2.
It is given that the bowls are identical from Fred&#x27;s point of view, thus formula_93, and the two must add up to 1, so both are equal to 0.5.
The event formula_94 is the observation of a plain cookie. From the contents of the bowls, we know that formula_95 and formula_96 Bayes&#x27; formula then yields
formula_97

Before we observed the cookie, the probability we assigned for Fred having chosen bowl #1 was the prior probability, formula_98, which was 0.5. After observing the cookie, we must revise the probability to formula_99, which is 0.6.

===Making a prediction===
An archaeologist is working at a site thought to be from the medieval period, between the 11th century to the 16th century. However, it is uncertain exactly when in this period the site was inhabited. Fragments of pottery are found, some of which are glazed and some of which are decorated. It is expected that if the site were inhabited during the early medieval period, then 1% of the pottery would be glazed and 50% of its area decorated, whereas if it had been inhabited in the late medieval period then 81% would be glazed and 5% of its area decorated. How confident can the archaeologist be in the date of inhabitation as fragments are unearthed?

The degree of belief in the continuous variable formula_100 (century) is to be calculated, with the discrete set of events formula_101 as evidence. Assuming linear variation of glaze and decoration with time, and that these variables are independent,

formula_102
formula_103
formula_104
formula_105

Assume a uniform prior of formula_106, and that trials are independent and identically distributed. When a new fragment of type formula_107 is discovered, Bayes&#x27; theorem is applied to update the degree of belief for each formula_108:
formula_109

A computer simulation of the changing belief as 50 fragments are unearthed is shown on the graph. In the simulation, the site was inhabited around 1420, or formula_110. By calculating the area under the relevant portion of the graph for 50 trials, the archaeologist can say that there is practically no chance the site was inhabited in the 11th and 12th centuries, about 1% chance that it was inhabited during the 13th century, 63% chance during the 14th century and 36% during the 15th century. The Bernstein-von Mises theorem asserts here the asymptotic convergence to the &quot;true&quot; distribution because the probability space corresponding to the discrete set of events formula_101 is finite (see above section on asymptotic behaviour of the posterior).

==In frequentist statistics and decision theory==

A decision-theoretic justification of the use of Bayesian inference was given by Abraham Wald, who proved that every unique Bayesian procedure is admissible. Conversely, every admissible statistical procedure is either a Bayesian procedure or a limit of Bayesian procedures.

Wald characterized admissible procedures as Bayesian procedures (and limits of Bayesian procedures), making the Bayesian formalism a central technique in such areas of frequentist inference as parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and computing confidence intervals. For example:
* &quot;Under some conditions, all admissible procedures are either Bayes procedures or limits of Bayes procedures (in various senses). These remarkable results, at least in their original form, are due essentially to Wald. They are useful because the property of being Bayes is easier to analyze than admissibility.&quot;
* &quot;In decision theory, a quite general method for proving admissibility consists in exhibiting a procedure as a unique Bayes solution.&quot;
*&quot;In the first chapters of this work, prior distributions with finite support and the corresponding Bayes procedures were used to establish some of the main theorems relating to the comparison of experiments. Bayes procedures with respect to more general prior distributions have played a very important role in the development of statistics, including its asymptotic theory.&quot; &quot;There are many problems where a glance at posterior distributions, for suitable priors, yields immediately interesting information. Also, this technique can hardly be avoided in sequential analysis.&quot;
*&quot;A useful fact is that any Bayes decision rule obtained by taking a proper prior over the whole parameter space must be admissible&quot;
*&quot;An important area of investigation in the development of admissibility ideas has been that of conventional sampling-theory procedures, and many interesting results have been obtained.&quot;

===Model selection===
Bayesian methodology also plays a role in model selection where the aim is to select one model from a set of competing models that represents most closely the underlying process that generated the observed data. In Bayesian model comparison, the model with the highest posterior probability given the data is selected. The posterior probability of a model depends on the evidence, or marginal likelihood, which reflects the probability that the data is generated by the model, and on the prior belief of the model. When two competing models are a priori considered to be equiprobable, the ratio of their posterior probabilities corresponds to the Bayes factor. Since Bayesian model comparison is aimed on selecting the model with the highest posterior probability, this methodology is also referred to as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) selection rule or the MAP probability rule.

==Probabilistic programming==
While conceptually simple, Bayesian methods can be mathematically and numerically challenging. Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) implement functions to easily build Bayesian models together with efficient automatic inference methods. This helps separate the model building from the inference, allowing practitioners to focus on their specific problems and leaving PPLs to handle the computational details for them.

==Applications==

===Statistical data analysis===

See the separate Wikipedia entry on Bayesian statistics, specifically the statistical modeling section in that page.

===Computer applications===
Bayesian inference has applications in artificial intelligence and expert systems. Bayesian inference techniques have been a fundamental part of computerized pattern recognition techniques since the late 1950s. There is also an ever-growing connection between Bayesian methods and simulation-based Monte Carlo techniques since complex models cannot be processed in closed form by a Bayesian analysis, while a graphical model structure &quot;may&quot; allow for efficient simulation algorithms like the Gibbs sampling and other Metropolis–Hastings algorithm schemes. Recently Bayesian inference has gained popularity among the phylogenetics community for these reasons; a number of applications allow many demographic and evolutionary parameters to be estimated simultaneously.

As applied to statistical classification, Bayesian inference has been used to develop algorithms for identifying e-mail spam. Applications which make use of Bayesian inference for spam filtering include CRM114, DSPAM, Bogofilter, SpamAssassin, SpamBayes, Mozilla, XEAMS, and others. Spam classification is treated in more detail in the article on the naïve Bayes classifier.

Solomonoff&#x27;s Inductive inference is the theory of prediction based on observations; for example, predicting the next symbol based upon a given series of symbols. The only assumption is that the environment follows some unknown but computable probability distribution. It is a formal inductive framework that combines two well-studied principles of inductive inference: Bayesian statistics and Occam&#x27;s Razor. Solomonoff&#x27;s universal prior probability of any prefix &quot;p&quot; of a computable sequence &quot;x&quot; is the sum of the probabilities of all programs (for a universal computer) that compute something starting with &quot;p&quot;. Given some &quot;p&quot; and any computable but unknown probability distribution from which &quot;x&quot; is sampled, the universal prior and Bayes&#x27; theorem can be used to predict the yet unseen parts of &quot;x&quot; in optimal fashion.

===Bioinformatics and healthcare applications===
Bayesian inference has been applied in different Bioinformatics applications, including differential gene expression analysis. Bayesian inference is also used in a general cancer risk model, called CIRI (Continuous Individualized Risk Index), where serial measurements are incorporated to update a Bayesian model which is primarily built from prior knowledge.

===In the courtroom===

Bayesian inference can be used by jurors to coherently accumulate the evidence for and against a defendant, and to see whether, in totality, it meets their personal threshold for &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;. Bayes&#x27; theorem is applied successively to all evidence presented, with the posterior from one stage becoming the prior for the next. The benefit of a Bayesian approach is that it gives the juror an unbiased, rational mechanism for combining evidence. It may be appropriate to explain Bayes&#x27; theorem to jurors in odds form, as betting odds are more widely understood than probabilities. Alternatively, a logarithmic approach, replacing multiplication with addition, might be easier for a jury to handle.

If the existence of the crime is not in doubt, only the identity of the culprit, it has been suggested that the prior should be uniform over the qualifying population. For example, if 1,000 people could have committed the crime, the prior probability of guilt would be 1/1000.

The use of Bayes&#x27; theorem by jurors is controversial. In the United Kingdom, a defence expert witness explained Bayes&#x27; theorem to the jury in &quot;R v Adams&quot;. The jury convicted, but the case went to appeal on the basis that no means of accumulating evidence had been provided for jurors who did not wish to use Bayes&#x27; theorem. The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, but it also gave the opinion that &quot;To introduce Bayes&#x27; Theorem, or any similar method, into a criminal trial plunges the jury into inappropriate and unnecessary realms of theory and complexity, deflecting them from their proper task.&quot;

Gardner-Medwin argues that the criterion on which a verdict in a criminal trial should be based is &quot;not&quot; the probability of guilt, but rather the &quot;probability of the evidence, given that the defendant is innocent&quot; (akin to a frequentist p-value). He argues that if the posterior probability of guilt is to be computed by Bayes&#x27; theorem, the prior probability of guilt must be known. This will depend on the incidence of the crime, which is an unusual piece of evidence to consider in a criminal trial. Consider the following three propositions:
: &quot;A&quot; – the known facts and testimony could have arisen if the defendant is guilty.
: &quot;B&quot; – the known facts and testimony could have arisen if the defendant is innocent.
: &quot;C&quot; – the defendant is guilty.

Gardner-Medwin argues that the jury should believe both &quot;A&quot; and not-&quot;B&quot; in order to convict. &quot;A&quot; and not-&quot;B&quot; implies the truth of &quot;C&quot;, but the reverse is not true. It is possible that &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; are both true, but in this case he argues that a jury should acquit, even though they know that they will be letting some guilty people go free. See also Lindley&#x27;s paradox.

===Bayesian epistemology===
Bayesian epistemology is a movement that advocates for Bayesian inference as a means of justifying the rules of inductive logic.

Karl Popper and David Miller have rejected the idea of Bayesian rationalism, i.e. using Bayes rule to make epistemological inferences: It is prone to the same vicious circle as any other justificationist epistemology, because it presupposes what it attempts to justify. According to this view, a rational interpretation of Bayesian inference would see it merely as a probabilistic version of falsification, rejecting the belief, commonly held by Bayesians, that high likelihood achieved by a series of Bayesian updates would prove the hypothesis beyond any reasonable doubt, or even with likelihood greater than 0.

===Other===
* The scientific method is sometimes interpreted as an application of Bayesian inference. In this view, Bayes&#x27; rule guides (or should guide) the updating of probabilities about hypotheses conditional on new observations or experiments. The Bayesian inference has also been applied to treat stochastic scheduling problems with incomplete information by Cai et al. (2009).

==Bayes and Bayesian inference==
The problem considered by Bayes in Proposition 9 of his essay, &quot;An Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances&quot;, is the posterior distribution for the parameter &quot;a&quot; (the success rate) of the binomial distribution.

==History==
The term &quot;Bayesian&quot; refers to Thomas Bayes (1701–1761), who proved that probabilistic limits could be placed on an unknown event. However, it was Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749–1827) who introduced (as Principle VI) what is now called Bayes&#x27; theorem and used it to address problems in celestial mechanics, medical statistics, reliability, and jurisprudence. Early Bayesian inference, which used uniform priors following Laplace&#x27;s principle of insufficient reason, was called &quot;inverse probability&quot; (because it infers backwards from observations to parameters, or from effects to causes). After the 1920s, &quot;inverse probability&quot; was largely supplanted by a collection of methods that came to be called frequentist statistics.

In the 20th century, the ideas of Laplace were further developed in two different directions, giving rise to &quot;objective&quot; and &quot;subjective&quot; currents in Bayesian practice. In the objective or &quot;non-informative&quot; current, the statistical analysis depends on only the model assumed, the data analyzed, and the method assigning the prior, which differs from one objective Bayesian practitioner to another. In the subjective or &quot;informative&quot; current, the specification of the prior depends on the belief (that is, propositions on which the analysis is prepared to act), which can summarize information from experts, previous studies, etc.

In the 1980s, there was a dramatic growth in research and applications of Bayesian methods, mostly attributed to the discovery of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which removed many of the computational problems, and an increasing interest in nonstandard, complex applications. Despite growth of Bayesian research, most undergraduate teaching is still based on frequentist statistics. Nonetheless, Bayesian methods are widely accepted and used, such as for example in the field of machine learning.

<text>Hooliganism is disruptive or unlawful behavior such as rioting, bullying and vandalism, often in connection with crowds at sporting events. A hooligan is a person that engages in illicit reckless behaviors and is a public nuisance.

==Etymology ==
There are several theories regarding the origin of the word &quot;hooliganism,&quot; which is a derivative of the word . &quot;The Compact Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states that the word may have originated from the surname of a rowdy Irish family in a music hall song of the 1890s. Clarence Rook, in his 1899 book &quot;Hooligan Nights&quot;, wrote that the word came from Patrick Hoolihan (or Hooligan), an Irish bouncer and thief who lived in London. In 2015, the BBC Scotland TV programme &quot;The Secret Life of Midges&quot; noted that the English commander-in-chief during the Jacobite rising of 1745, General Wade, misheard the local Scots Gaelic word for midge—&quot;meanbh-chuileag&quot;—and coined the word &quot;hooligan&quot; to describe his fury and frustration at the way the tiny biting creatures made the life of his soldiers and himself a misery; this derivation may be apocryphal.

===Early usage===
The word first appeared in print in London police court reports in 1894 referring to the name of a gang of youths in the Lambeth area of London—the &quot;Hooligan Boys&quot;, and later—the &quot;O&#x27;Hooligan Boys&quot;.

In August 1898 the murder of Henry Mappin in Lambeth committed by a member of the gang drew further attention to the word which was immediately popularised by the press. The London newspaper &quot;The Daily Graphic&quot; wrote in an article on 22 August 1898, &quot;The avalanche of brutality which, under the name of &#x27;Hooliganism&#x27; ... has cast such a dire slur on the social records of South London.&quot;

The inquest was carried out by Mr Braxton Hicks who &quot;remarked that the activity of the gang he referred to was not confined to Lambeth, but extended to numerous other districts. It was composed of young fellows who scorned to do a stroke of work, and obtained a living by blackmailing. It was a common practice for three or four of these men to walk into a shop and offer the shopman the alternative of giving them a dollar for drink or having his shop wrecked. In connection with the Oakley-street tragedy intimidation had reached an unexampled case. Witnesses had been warned that it would be as much as their life was worth to give evidence against John Darcy. On Wednesday plain-clothes men escorted the witnesses from the court singly. He himself had been warned — not by anonymous letter but through a mysterious personal medium — that if seen in a certain neighbourhood he would be done for. A magistrate had also told him that he had been the recipient of a like indignity.&quot;

Arthur Conan Doyle wrote in his 1904 short story &quot;The Adventure of the Six Napoleons&quot;, &quot;It seemed to be one of those senseless acts of Hooliganism which occur from time to time, and it was reported to the constable on the beat as such.&quot; H. G. Wells wrote in his 1909 semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Tono-Bungay&quot;, &quot;Three energetic young men of the hooligan type, in neck-wraps and caps, were packing wooden cases with papered-up bottles, amidst much straw and confusion.&quot;

According to &quot;Life&quot; magazine (30 July 1951), the comic strip artist and political cartoonist Frederick Burr Opper introduced a character called Happy Hooligan in 1900; &quot;hapless Happy appeared regularly in U.S. newspapers for more than 30 years&quot;, a &quot;naive, skinny, baboon-faced tramp who invariably wore a tomato can for a hat.&quot; &quot;Life&quot; brought this up by way of criticizing the Soviet U.N. delegate Yakov A. Malik for misusing the word. Malik had indignantly referred to anti-Soviet demonstrators in New York as &quot;hooligans&quot;. Happy Hooligan, &quot;Life&quot; reminded its readers, &quot;became a national hero, not by making trouble, which Mr. Malik understands is the function of a hooligan, but by getting himself help.&quot;

===Modern usage===
Later, as the meaning of the word shifted slightly, none of the possible alternatives had precisely the same undertones of a person, usually young, who belongs to an informal group and commits acts of vandalism or criminal damage, starts fights, and who causes disturbances but is not a thief. Hooliganism is now related to sport.

==Violence in sports==

The words &quot;hooliganism&quot; and &quot;hooligan&quot; began to be associated with violence in sports, in particular from the 1970s in the UK with football hooliganism. The phenomenon, however, long preceded the modern term; for example, one of the earliest known instances of crowd violence at a sporting event took place in ancient Constantinople. Two chariot racing factions, the Blues and the Greens, were involved in the Nika riots which lasted around a week in 532 CE; nearly half the city was burned or destroyed, in addition to tens of thousands of deaths.

Sports crowd violence continues to be a worldwide concerning phenomenon exacting at times a large number of injuries, damage to property and casualties. Individual, contextual, social and environmental factors interact and influence one another through a dynamic process occurring at different levels. Macro-sociological accounts suggest that structural strains, experiences of deprivation or a low socio-economic background can at times be instrumental to the acceptance and reproduction of norms that tolerate great levels of violence and territoriality, which is a common feature of football hooliganism. Furthermore, social cleavages within societies facilitate the development of strong in-groups bonds and intense feelings of antagonism towards outsiders which in turn can facilitate group identification and affect the likelihood of fan violence.

===In British sports===
Beginning in at least the 1960s, the United Kingdom gained a reputation worldwide for football hooliganism; the phenomenon was often dubbed the &quot;British&quot; or &quot;English Disease&quot;. However, since the 1980s and well into the 1990s the UK government has led a widescale crackdown on football related violence. While football hooliganism has been a growing concern in some continental European countries in recent years, British football fans now tend to have a better reputation abroad. Although reports of British football hooliganism still surface, the instances now tend to occur at pre-arranged locations rather than at the matches themselves.

===In American sports===
Football (soccer) and other sports hooliganism overall is rare in the United States in part because of stricter legal penalties for vandalism and physical violence, club markets having their own territory of fans, venues banning weapons, stricter security during games, and a stronger taboo on politics, class, race, and religion into the American sporting culture. Although isolated drunken fights at games do occur, they rarely escalate to major brawling comparable to Europe and Latin America.

==In the Soviet Union and Russia==
In the Soviet Union the word &quot;khuligan&quot; ( – transliteration of the English word) was used to refer to those perpetrating public misconduct. Hooliganism (, &quot;khuliganstvo&quot;) was listed as a criminal offense, similar to disorderly conduct in some other jurisdictions, and used as a catch-all charge for prosecuting unapproved behavior.

Since the fall of the Soviet Union, hooliganism is defined generally in the Criminal Code of Russia as a medium gravity crime.

Olympic medalist Vasiliy Khmelevskiy was convicted of hooliganism for setting a costumed person on fire during a celebration in Minsk in 1979 and sentenced to five years of imprisonment. Mathias Rust was convicted of hooliganism, among other things, for his 1987 Cessna landing on Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge next to Red Square.

More recently, the same charge has been leveled against members of the feminist punk group Pussy Riot for which three members each received a two-year sentence on 17 August 2012. Hooliganism charges were also levelled against the Greenpeace protesters in October 2013. In March 2022, Marina Ovsyannikova, a Russian journalist who held up a banner protesting the Russian invasion of Ukraine during a national news broadcast, was convicted of flouting Russian anti-protest laws and fined ₽30,000 for her actions. The Kremlin called her actions an act of hooliganism.

<text>Abbot Howard Hoffman (November 30, 1936 – April 12, 1989) was an American political and social activist who co-founded the Youth International Party (&quot;Yippies&quot;) and was a member of the Chicago Seven. He was also a leading proponent of the Flower Power movement.

As a member of the Chicago Seven, Hoffman was charged with and tried for activities during the 1968 Democratic National Convention, for conspiring to use interstate commerce with intent to incite a riot and crossing state lines with the intent to incite a riot under the anti-riot provisions of Title X of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. Five of the Chicago Seven defendants, including Hoffman, were convicted of crossing state lines with intent to incite a riot; all of the convictions were vacated after an appeal and the U.S. Department of Justice declined to pursue another trial. Hoffman, along with all of the defendants and their attorneys were also convicted and sentenced for contempt of court by the judge; these convictions were also vacated after an appeal.

Hoffman continued his activism into the 1970s and remains an icon of the anti-Vietnam war movement and the counterculture era. He died by suicide with a phenobarbital overdose in 1989 at age 52.

== Early life and education ==
Abbot Howard Hoffman was born November 30, 1936, in Worcester, Massachusetts, to Florence (née Schanberg) and John Hoffman. Hoffman was raised in a middle-class Jewish household and had two younger siblings.

During his school days, he became known as a troublemaker who started fights, played pranks, vandalized school property, and referred to teachers by their first names. In his second year, Hoffman was expelled from Classical High School, a now-closed public high school in Worcester. As an atheist, Hoffman wrote a paper declaring that, &quot;God could not possibly exist, for if he did, there wouldn&#x27;t be any suffering in the world.&quot; The irate teacher ripped up the paper and called him &quot;a Communist punk.&quot; Hoffman jumped on the teacher and started fighting him until he was restrained and removed from the school. On June 3, 1954, 17-year-old Hoffman was arrested for the first time, for driving without a license. After his expulsion, he attended Worcester Academy, graduating in 1955. Hoffman engaged in many behaviors typical of rebellious teenagers in the 1950s, such as riding motorcycles, wearing leather jackets, and sporting a ducktail haircut.

Upon graduating, he enrolled at nearby Brandeis University, where he studied under professors such as noted psychologist Abraham Maslow, often considered the father of humanistic psychology. He was also a student of Marxist theorist Herbert Marcuse, who Hoffman said had a profound effect on his political outlook. Hoffman would later cite Marcuse&#x27;s influence during his activism and his theories on revolution. He was on the Brandeis tennis team, which was coached by journalist Bud Collins. Hoffman graduated with a B.A. in psychology in 1959. That fall, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where he completed coursework toward a master&#x27;s degree in psychology. Soon after, he married his girlfriend Sheila Karklin in May 1960.

== Countercultural activism ==

===Early activity===

Before his days as a leading member of the Yippie movement, Hoffman was involved with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), and organized Liberty House, which sold items to support the civil rights movement in the southern United States. During the Vietnam War, Hoffman was an anti-war activist, using deliberately comical and theatrical tactics.

In late 1966, Hoffman met with a radical community-action group called the Diggers and studied their ideology. He later returned to New York and published a book with this knowledge. Doing so was considered a violation by the Diggers. Diggers co-founder Peter Coyote explained:

One of Hoffman&#x27;s well-known stunts was on August 24, 1967, when he led members of the movement to the gallery of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The protesters threw fistfuls of real and fake dollar bills down to the traders below, some of whom booed, while others began to scramble frantically to grab the money as fast as they could. Accounts of the amount of money that Hoffman and the group tossed was said to be as little as $30 to $300. Hoffman claimed to be pointing out that, metaphorically, that&#x27;s what NYSE traders &quot;were already doing.&quot; &quot;We didn&#x27;t call the press,&quot; wrote Hoffman, &quot;At that time we really had no notion of anything called a media event.&quot; Yet the press was quick to react and by evening the event was reported around the world. After that incident, the stock exchange spent $20,000 (approximately ) to enclose the gallery with bulletproof glass.

In October 1967, David Dellinger of the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam asked Jerry Rubin to help mobilize and direct a march on the Pentagon. The protesters gathered at the Lincoln Memorial as Dellinger and Dr. Benjamin Spock gave speeches to the mass of people. From there, the group marched towards the Pentagon. As the protesters neared the Pentagon, they were met by soldiers of the 82nd Airborne Division who formed a human barricade blocking the Pentagon steps. Not to be dissuaded, Hoffman vowed to levitate the Pentagon claiming he would attempt to use psychic energy to levitate the Pentagon until it would turn orange and begin to vibrate, at which time the war in Vietnam would end. Allen Ginsberg led Tibetan chants to assist Hoffman.

=== Chicago Seven conspiracy trial ===
Hoffman was a member of a group of defendants that became known as the Chicago Seven (originally known as the Chicago Eight), which included fellow Yippie Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Rennie Davis, John Froines, Lee Weiner, Tom Hayden, and Bobby Seale (before his trial was severed from the others), who were charged by the United States federal government with conspiracy, crossing state lines with intent to incite a riot, and other charges related to anti-Vietnam War and countercultural protests in Chicago, Illinois during the 1968 Democratic National Convention.

Presided over by Judge Julius Hoffman (no relation to Hoffman, about which he joked throughout the trial), Abbie Hoffman&#x27;s courtroom antics frequently grabbed the headlines; one day, defendants Hoffman and Rubin appeared in court dressed in judicial robes, while on another day, Hoffman was sworn in as a witness with his hand giving the finger. Judge Hoffman became the favorite courtroom target of the Chicago Seven defendants, who frequently would insult the judge to his face. Abbie Hoffman told Judge Hoffman &quot;you are a &quot;shande fur de goyim&quot; [disgrace in front of the gentiles]. You would have served Hitler better.&quot; He later added that &quot;your idea of justice is the only obscenity in the room.&quot; Both Davis and Rubin told the judge, &quot;This court is bullshit.&quot; When Hoffman was asked in what state he resided, he replied the &quot;state of mind of my brothers and sisters.&quot;

Other celebrities were called as &quot;cultural witnesses&quot; including Allen Ginsberg, Phil Ochs, Arlo Guthrie, Judy Collins, Norman Mailer and others. Hoffman closed the trial with a speech in which he quoted Abraham Lincoln, making the claim that the president himself, were he alive today, would also have been arrested in Chicago&#x27;s Lincoln Park.

On February 18, 1970, Hoffman and four of the other defendants (Rubin, Dellinger, Davis, and Hayden) were found guilty of intent to incite a riot while crossing state lines. All seven defendants were found not guilty of conspiracy. At sentencing, Hoffman suggested the judge try LSD and offered to set him up with &quot;a dealer he knew in Florida.&quot; (The judge was known to be headed to Florida for a post-trial vacation.) Each of the five was sentenced to five years in prison and given a $5,000 fine ().

However, all convictions were subsequently overturned by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.

=== Continuing protests ===
At Woodstock in 1969, Hoffman interrupted the Who&#x27;s performance to attempt to speak against the jailing of John Sinclair of the White Panther Party. He grabbed a microphone and yelled, &quot;I think this is a pile of shit while John Sinclair rots in prison ...&quot; Pete Townshend was adjusting his amplifier between songs and turned to look at Hoffman over his left shoulder. Townshend shouted &quot;Fuck off! Fuck off my fucking stage!&quot; and reportedly ran at Hoffman with his guitar and hit Hoffman in the back, although Townshend later denied attacking Hoffman. Townshend later said that while he actually agreed with Hoffman on Sinclair&#x27;s imprisonment, he would have knocked him offstage regardless of the content of his message, given that Hoffman had violated the &quot;sanctity of the stage,&quot; i.e., the right of the band to perform uninterrupted by distractions not relevant to the show. The incident took place during a camera change and was not captured on film. The audio of this incident, however, can be heard on The Who&#x27;s box set &quot;Thirty Years of Maximum R&amp;B&quot; (Disc 2, Track 20, &quot;Abbie Hoffman Incident&quot;).

In 1971, Hoffman published &quot;Steal This Book&quot;, which advised readers on how to live for free. (Many readers followed his advice and stole the book, leading many bookstores to refuse to carry it.) The book contained a section called &quot;Free Communication,&quot; in which Hoffman encourages his readership to take to the stage at rock concerts to use the pre-assembled audience and PA system to get their message out. However, he mentions that &quot;interrupting the concert is frowned upon since it is only spitting in the faces of people you are trying to reach.&quot;

In &quot;Woodstock Nation&quot;, Hoffman mentions the incident and says he was on a bad LSD trip at the time. Joe Shea, then a reporter for the &quot;Times Herald-Record&quot;, a local newspaper that covered the event on-site, said he saw the incident. He recalled that Hoffman was actually hit in the back of the head by Townshend&#x27;s guitar and toppled directly into the pit in front of the stage. He does not recall any &quot;shove&quot; from Townshend, and discounts both men&#x27;s accounts.

Hoffman was also the author of several other books, including &quot;Vote!&quot; co-written with Rubin and Ed Sanders.

==Later life==
===Arrest and flight===
Hoffman was arrested on August 28, 1973, for intent to sell and distribute cocaine. He always maintained that undercover police agents entrapped him into a drug deal and planted suitcases of cocaine in his office. In the spring of 1974, Hoffman skipped bail, underwent cosmetic surgery to alter his appearance, and hid from authorities for several years.

Some believed that Hoffman made himself a target. In 1998, Peter Coyote stated:

Hoffman lived under the name Barry Freed in Fineview, New York, near Thousand Island Park, a private resort on the St. Lawrence River. He helped coordinate an environmental campaign to preserve the St. Lawrence River. Hoffman also was the travel columnist for &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; magazine. On September 4, 1980, he surrendered to authorities, and he appeared the same day on a pre-taped edition of ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot; in an interview with Barbara Walters. Hoffman received a one-year sentence but was released after four months.

=== Return to activism ===

In November 1986, Hoffman was arrested along with 14 others, including Amy Carter, the daughter of former President Jimmy Carter, for trespassing at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The charges stemmed from a protest against the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s recruitment on the UMass campus. Since the university&#x27;s policy limited campus recruitment to law-abiding organizations, the defense argued that the CIA engaged in illegal activities. The federal district court judge permitted expert witnesses, including former Attorney General Ramsey Clark and a former CIA agent who testified that the CIA carried on an illegal Contra war against the Sandinista government in Nicaragua in violation of the Boland Amendment.

In three days of testimony, more than a dozen defense witnesses, including Daniel Ellsberg, and former Contra leader Édgar Chamorro, described the CIA&#x27;s role in more than two decades of covert, illegal, and often violent activities. In his closing argument, Hoffman, acting as his own attorney, placed his actions within the best tradition of American civil disobedience. He quoted from Thomas Paine, &quot;the most outspoken and farsighted of the leaders of the American Revolution: &#x27;Every age and generation must be as free to act for itself, in all cases, as the ages and generations which preceded it. Man has no property in man, neither has any generation a property in the generations which are to follow.&#x27;&quot;

Hoffman concluded: &quot;Thomas Paine was talking about this Spring day in this courtroom. A verdict of not guilty will say, &#x27;When our country is right, keep it right; but when it is wrong, right those wrongs.&#x27;&quot; On April 15, 1987, the jury found Hoffman and the other defendants not guilty.

After his acquittal, Hoffman acted in a cameo appearance in Oliver Stone&#x27;s later-released anti-Vietnam War film, &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; (1989). He essentially played himself in the movie, waving a flag on the ramparts of an administration building during a campus protest that was being teargassed and crushed by state troopers.

Despite his return to activism, Hoffman also grew frustrated the growing unwillingness of the younger generation to engage in protests.

In 1987 Hoffman summed up his views:

Later that same year, Hoffman and Jonathan Silvers wrote &quot;Steal This Urine Test&quot; (published October 5, 1987), which exposed the internal contradictions of the War on Drugs and suggested ways to circumvent its most intrusive measures. Although Hoffman&#x27;s satiric humor was on display throughout the book, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;the extensive, in-depth research and a barrage of facts and figures... make this the definitive guide to the current drug-testing environment.&quot;

Stone&#x27;s &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; was released on December 20, 1989, just eight months after Hoffman&#x27;s suicide on April 12, 1989. At the time of his death, Hoffman was at the height of a renewed public visibility, one of the few 1960s radicals who still commanded the attention of the media. He regularly lectured about the CIA&#x27;s covert activities, including assassinations disguised as suicides. His &quot;Playboy&quot; article (October 1988) outlining the connections that constitute the &quot;October Surprise&quot;, brought that alleged conspiracy to the attention of a wide-ranging American readership for the first time.

== Personal life ==
In 1960, Hoffman married Sheila Karklin (1938-2021), and had two children, Andrew (born 1960) and Amy (1962–2007), who later went by the name Ilya. Hoffman and Karklin divorced in 1966. In 1967, he married Anita Kushner (1942-1998) in Manhattan&#x27;s Central Park. They had one son whom they named &quot;&quot; Hoffman, deliberately using a lowercase &quot;a&quot;. He and Kushner were effectively separated when Hoffman became a fugitive in 1973, although they were not formally divorced until 1980. While underground, Hoffman&#x27;s companion was Johanna Lawrenson.

His personal life drew a great deal of scrutiny from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), whose file on him was 13,262 pages long.

His brother Jack died of COVID-19 on June 2, 2020.

== Death ==
Hoffman was found dead in his apartment in Solebury Township, Pennsylvania, on April 12, 1989, age 52. The cause of death was suicide by overdose from 150 phenobarbital tablets and liquor. Two hundred pages of handwritten notes were nearby, many detailing his moods. He had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1980. He had recently changed treatment medications and was reportedly depressed when his 83-year-old mother was diagnosed with cancer (she died in 1996 at age 90). Some who were close to him claimed that he was also unhappy about reaching middle age, combined with the fact that the liberal upheaval of the 1960s had produced a conservative backlash in the 1980s. In 1984, he had expressed dismay that the current generation of young people were not as interested in protesting and social activism as the youth had been during the 1960s.

His death was officially ruled a suicide. Hoffman&#x27;s fellow Chicago Seven defendant David Dellinger disputed this; he said, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe for one moment the suicide thing&quot; and said that Hoffman had &quot;numerous plans for the future.&quot; However, the coroner stood by the ruling, saying, &quot;There is no way to take that amount of phenobarbital without intent. It was intentional and self-inflicted.&quot;

His memorial service was held a week later in Worcester, Massachusetts, at Temple Emanuel, the synagogue that he attended as a child, with 1,000 friends and family members in attendance.

<doc id="49582" wikidata="Q2164009" url="?curid=49582" title="Battle of Lewes">
<text>The Battle of Lewes was one of two main battles of the conflict known as the Second Barons&#x27; War. It took place at Lewes in Sussex, on 14 May 1264. It marked the high point of the career of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, and made him the &quot;uncrowned King of England&quot;. Henry III&#x27;s forces left the safety of Lewes Castle and St. Pancras Priory to engage the barons in battle and were initially successful, with Henry&#x27;s son Prince Edward routing part of the baronial army with a cavalry charge. However, Edward pursued his quarry off the battlefield and left Henry&#x27;s men exposed. Henry was forced to launch an infantry attack up Offham Hill where he was defeated by the barons&#x27; men defending the summit. The royalists fled back to the castle and priory and the King was forced to sign the Mise of Lewes, ceding many of his powers to de Montfort.

== Background ==
Henry III was an unpopular monarch due to his autocratic style, displays of favouritism and refusal to negotiate with the barons. The barons eventually imposed a constitutional reform known as the Provisions of Oxford upon Henry, including provision for a thrice-yearly meeting led by Simon de Montfort to discuss matters of government. Henry sought to escape the restrictions of the provisions and applied to Louis IX of France to arbitrate in the dispute. Louis agreed with Henry and annulled the provisions. Montfort was angered by this and rebelled against the King along with other barons in the Second Barons&#x27; War.

The war was not initially openly fought, each side toured the country to raise support for their army. A series of massacres of Jews in Worcester, London, Canterbury and other cities was conducted by Montfort&#x27;s allies.

By May, the King&#x27;s force had reached Lewes where they intended to halt to allow reinforcements to reach them. The King encamped at St. Pancras Priory with a force of infantry, while his son, Prince Edward (later King Edward I), commanded the cavalry at Lewes Castle to the north. De Montfort approached the King with the intention of negotiating a truce or, failing that, to draw him into open battle. The King rejected the negotiations, and de Montfort moved his men from Fletching to Offham Hill, a mile to the north-west of Lewes, in a night march that surprised the royalist forces.

== Deployment ==
The royalist army approached twice the size of de Montfort&#x27;s. Henry commanded the centre, with Prince Edward, William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke, and John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey, on the right; and Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, and his son, Henry of Almain, on the left. The barons held the higher ground overlooking Lewes and had ordered their men to wear white crosses as a distinguishing emblem. De Montfort split his forces into four parts, giving his son, Henry de Montfort command of one quarter; Gilbert de Clare with John FitzJohn and William of Montchensy another; a third portion consisting of Londoners was placed under Nicholas de Segrave whilst de Montfort himself led the fourth quarter with Thomas of Pelveston.

== Battle ==
The baronial forces commenced the battle with a surprise dawn attack on foragers sent out from the royalist forces. The King then made his move. Edward led a cavalry charge against Segrave&#x27;s Londoners, placed on the left of the baronial line, that caused them to break and flee to the village of Offham. Edward pursued them for some four miles, leaving the King unsupported. Henry was forced to launch an attack with his centre and right divisions straight up Offham Hill into the baronial line, which awaited them at the defensive. Cornwall&#x27;s division faltered almost immediately, but Henry&#x27;s men fought on until compelled to retreat by the arrival of de Montfort&#x27;s men who had been held back as the baronial reserve.

The King&#x27;s men were forced down the hill and into Lewes where they engaged in a fighting retreat to the castle and priory. Edward returned with his weary cavalrymen and launched a counterattack. However, upon locating his father, Edward was persuaded that, with the town ablaze and many of the King&#x27;s supporters having fled, it was time to accept de Montfort&#x27;s renewed offer of negotiations. The Earl of Cornwall was captured by the barons when he was unable to reach the safety of the priory and, being discovered in a windmill, was taunted with cries of &quot;Come down, come down, thou wicked miller.&quot;

== Aftermath ==
The King was forced to sign the so-called Mise of Lewes. Though the document has not survived, it is clear that Henry was forced to accept the Provisions of Oxford, while Prince Edward remained a hostage of the barons. This put de Montfort in a position of ultimate power, which would last until Prince Edward&#x27;s escape, and de Montfort&#x27;s subsequent defeat and death at the Battle of Evesham in August 1265. Following the battle, debts to Jews were cancelled, and the records destroyed; this had been a key war aim.

In 1994, an archaeological survey of the cemetery of St Nicholas Hospital, in Lewes revealed the remains of bodies that were thought to be combatants from the Battle of Lewes. However, in 2014, it was revealed that some of the skeletons may actually be much older, with a skeleton known as &quot;skeleton 180&quot; being contemporary with the Norman invasion.

== Location ==
There remains some uncertainty over the location of the battle, with Offham Hill&#x27;s eastern and lower slopes covered by modern housing. Recently, a new consensus on the location of the main engagement places it on the current location of HM Prison Lewes. Contemporary sources suggest the initial engagement took place along the approximate lines of what is now Nevill Road. The top and southern slopes remain accessible by footpaths across agricultural land, and the ruins of the priory and castle are also open to visitors.

<doc id="49584" wikidata="Q166635" url="?curid=49584" title="Stanley Baldwin">
<text>Stanley Baldwin, 1st Earl Baldwin of Bewdley (3 August 186714 December 1947) was a British statesman and Conservative politician who dominated the government of the United Kingdom between the world wars. He was prime minister on three occasions, from May 1923 to January 1924, from November 1924 to June 1929, and from June 1935 to May 1937.

Born to a prosperous family in Bewdley, Worcestershire, Baldwin was educated at Hawtreys, Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He joined the family iron- and steel-making business, and entered the House of Commons in 1908 as the member for Bewdley, succeeding his father Alfred. He was Financial Secretary to the Treasury (1917–1921) and President of the Board of Trade (1921–1922) in the coalition ministry of David Lloyd George and then rose rapidly. In 1922, Baldwin was one of the prime movers in the withdrawal of Conservative support from Lloyd George; he subsequently became Chancellor of the Exchequer in Bonar Law&#x27;s Conservative ministry. Upon Law&#x27;s resignation for health reasons in May 1923, Baldwin became prime minister and leader of the Conservative Party. He called an election in December 1923 on the issue of tariffs and lost the Conservatives&#x27; parliamentary majority, after which Ramsay MacDonald formed a minority Labour government.

After winning the 1924 general election, Baldwin formed his second government, which saw important tenures of office by Austen Chamberlain (Foreign Secretary), Winston Churchill (at the Exchequer) and Neville Chamberlain (Health). The latter two ministers strengthened Conservative appeal by reforms in areas formerly associated with the Liberal Party. They included industrial conciliation, unemployment insurance, a more extensive old-age pension system, slum clearance, more private housing and expansion of maternal care and childcare. However, continuing sluggish economic growth and declines in mining and heavy industry weakened Baldwin&#x27;s base of support. His government also saw the General Strike in 1926 and introduced the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927 to curb the powers of trade unions.

Baldwin narrowly lost the 1929 general election and his continued leadership of the party was subject to extensive criticism by press barons Lord Rothermere and Lord Beaverbrook. In 1931, with the onset of the Great Depression, Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald formed a National Government, most of whose ministers were Conservatives, which won an enormous majority at the 1931 general election. As Lord President of the Council and one of four Conservatives among the small ten-member Cabinet, Baldwin took over many of the Prime Minister&#x27;s duties when MacDonald&#x27;s health deteriorated. This government saw an Act delivering increased self-government for India, a measure opposed by Churchill and by many rank-and-file Conservatives. The Statute of Westminster 1931 gave Dominion status to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, while taking the first step towards the Commonwealth of Nations. As party leader, Baldwin made many striking innovations, such as clever use of radio and film, that made him highly visible to the public and strengthened Conservative appeal.

In 1935, Baldwin replaced MacDonald as prime minister and won the 1935 general election with another large majority. During this time, he oversaw the beginning of British rearmament and the abdication of King Edward VIII. Baldwin&#x27;s third government saw a number of crises in foreign affairs, including the public uproar over the Hoare–Laval Pact, the remilitarisation of the Rhineland, and the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. Baldwin stepped down on 28 May 1937 and was succeeded by Neville Chamberlain.

Historical retrospection and analysis of Baldwin&#x27;s political career have been complex. During his tenure, Baldwin was regarded as a popular and successful prime minister, but for the final decade of his life and for many years afterwards he was vilified for having presided over high unemployment and a struggling economy in the 1930s. Baldwin has been criticized both contemporaneously and more recently as he was among several high-profile British public figures who instituted the policy of appeasement towards Adolf Hitler and failed to rearm sufficiently to prepare for the Second World War. However, some have praised Baldwin for his role in forcing and expediting the abdication of Edward VIII, as rumours circulated about Edward&#x27;s Nazi sympathies and potential compromises to British national security. Today, modern scholars generally rank him in the upper half of British prime ministers.

==Early life: family, education and marriage==
Baldwin was born at Lower Park House (Lower Park, Bewdley) in Worcestershire, England, to Alfred and Louisa (MacDonald) Baldwin, and through his mother was a first cousin of, and had a lifelong friendship with, the writer and poet Rudyard Kipling. A summer spent with Kipling and his sister with the freedom of farm and forest at Loughton, Essex, in 1877 was seminal to the development of both boys.

The family was prosperous, and owned the eponymous iron- and steel-making business that in later years became part of Richard Thomas and Baldwins.

Baldwin&#x27;s schools were St Michael&#x27;s School, at the time located in Slough, Buckinghamshire (now Berkshire), followed by Harrow School. He later wrote that &quot;all the king&#x27;s horses and all the king&#x27;s men would have failed to have drawn me into the company of school masters, and in relation to them I once had every qualification as a passive resister.&quot; Baldwin then went on to the University of Cambridge, where he studied history at Trinity College. His time at university was blighted by the presence, as Master of Trinity, of Henry Montagu Butler, his former headmaster who had punished him at Harrow for writing a piece of schoolboy smut. He was asked to resign from the Magpie &amp; Stump (the Trinity College debating society) for never speaking, and, after receiving a third-class degree in history, he went into the family business of iron manufacturing. His father sent him to Mason College for one session of technical training in metallurgy as preparation. As a young man he served briefly as a second lieutenant in the Artillery Volunteers at Malvern, and in 1897 became a JP for the county of Worcestershire.

Baldwin married Lucy Ridsdale on 12 September 1892. Following the birth of a still-born son in January 1894, the couple had six surviving children:
* Lady Diana Lucy Baldwin (8 April 1895 – 21 May 1982)
* Lady Leonora Stanley Baldwin (10 July 1896 – 23 June 1989)
* Lady Pamela Margaret Baldwin (16 September 1897 – 14 August 1976)
* Major Oliver Ridsdale Baldwin, 2nd Earl Baldwin of Bewdley (1 March 1899 – 10 August 1958)
* Lady Esther Louisa (Betty) Baldwin (16 March 1902 – 22 June 1981)
* Arthur Windham Baldwin, 3rd Earl Baldwin of Bewdley (22 March 1904 – 5 July 1976)

Baldwin&#x27;s youngest daughter, Lady Betty, was severely injured by shrapnel in March 1941 as a result of a bombing raid which destroyed the Café de Paris nightclub she was attending. She required facial reconstruction surgery from the pioneering surgeon Archibald MacIndoe.

Baldwin proved to be an adept businessman, and acquired a reputation as a modernising industrialist. He inherited £200,000, , and a directorship of the Great Western Railway on the death of his father in 1908.

==Early political career==
===Member of Parliament===
In the 1906 general election he contested Kidderminster but lost amidst the Conservative landslide defeat after the party split on the issue of free trade. In a by-election in 1908 he was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Bewdley, in which role he succeeded his father, who had died earlier that year. During the First World War he became Parliamentary Private Secretary to the party leader Bonar Law. In 1917 he was appointed to the junior ministerial post of Financial Secretary to the Treasury, where he sought to encourage voluntary donations by the rich to repay the United Kingdom&#x27;s war debt, writing letters to &quot;The Times&quot; under the pseudonym &#x27;FST&#x27;, many of which were published. He relinquished to the Treasury one fifth of his own fortune (its total estimated at own account as £580,000) held in the form of War Loan stock worth £120,000.

===Treasury and President of the Board of Trade===

Although he entered politics at a relatively late age, his rise to the top leadership was very rapid. In the Treasury he served jointly with Hardman Lever, who had been appointed in 1916, but after 1919 Baldwin carried out the duties largely alone. He was appointed to the Privy Council in the 1920 Birthday Honours. In 1921 he was promoted to the Cabinet as President of the Board of Trade.

===Chancellor of the Exchequer===
In late 1922 dissatisfaction was steadily growing within the Conservative Party over its coalition with the Liberal David Lloyd George. At a meeting of Conservative MPs at the Carlton Club in October, Baldwin announced that he would no longer support the coalition, and famously condemned Lloyd George for being a &quot;dynamic force&quot; that was bringing destruction across politics. The meeting chose to leave the coalition, against the wishes of most of the party leadership. As a direct result Bonar Law was forced to search for new ministers for a Cabinet which he would lead, and so promoted Baldwin to the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer. In the 15 November 1922 general election the Conservatives were returned with a majority in their own right.

==Prime Minister (1923–1924)==
===Appointment===
In May 1923 Bonar Law was diagnosed with terminal cancer and retired immediately; he died five months later. With many of the party&#x27;s senior leading figures standing aloof and outside of the government, there were only two candidates to succeed him: Lord Curzon, the foreign secretary, and Baldwin. The choice formally fell to King George V acting on the advice of senior ministers and officials.

It is not entirely clear what factors proved most crucial, but some Conservative politicians felt that Curzon was unsuitable for the role of prime minister because he was a member of the House of Lords. Curzon was strong and experienced in international affairs, but his lack of experience in domestic affairs, his personal character quirks and his huge inherited wealth and many directorships at a time when the Conservative Party was seeking to shed its patrician image were all deemed impediments. Much weight at the time was given to the intervention of Arthur Balfour.

The King turned to Baldwin to become prime minister. Initially Baldwin was also Chancellor of the Exchequer whilst he sought to recruit the former Liberal Chancellor Reginald McKenna to join the government. When this failed he appointed Neville Chamberlain to that position.

===1923 general election===
The Conservatives now had a clear majority in the House of Commons and could govern for five years before holding a general election, but Baldwin felt bound by Bonar Law&#x27;s pledge at the previous election that there would be no introduction of tariffs without a further election. Thus Baldwin turned towards a degree of protectionism which would remain a key party message during his lifetime. With the country facing growing unemployment in the wake of free trade imports driving down prices and profits, Baldwin decided to call an early general election in December 1923 to seek a mandate to introduce protectionist tariffs which, he hoped, would drive down unemployment and spur an economic recovery. He expected to unite his party but he divided it, for protectionism proved a divisive issue. The election was inconclusive: the Conservatives had 258 MPs, Labour 191 and the reunited Liberals 159. Whilst the Conservatives retained a plurality in the House of Commons, they had been clearly defeated on the central issue: tariffs. Baldwin remained prime minister until the opening of the new Parliament in January 1924, when his administration was defeated in a vote on its legislative programme set out in the King&#x27;s Speech. He offered his resignation to George V immediately.

==Leader of the Opposition (1924)==
Baldwin successfully held on to the party leadership amid some colleagues&#x27; calls for his resignation. For the next ten months, an unstable minority Labour government under Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald held office. On 13 March 1924, the Labour government was defeated for the first time in the Commons, although the Conservatives decided to vote with Labour later that day against the Liberals.

During a debate on the naval estimates the Conservatives opposed Labour but supported them on 18 March in a vote on cutting expenditure on the Singapore Naval Base. Baldwin also cooperated with MacDonald over Irish policy to stop it becoming a party-political issue.

The Labour government was negotiating with the Soviet government over intended commercial treaties – &#x27;the Russian Treaties&#x27; – to provide most favoured nation privileges and diplomatic status for the UK trade delegation; and a treaty that would settle the claims of pre-revolutionary British bondholders and holders of confiscated property, after which the British government would guarantee a loan to the Soviet Union. Baldwin decided to vote against the government over the Russian Treaties, which brought the government down on 8 October.

===1924 re-election===
The general election held in October 1924 brought a landslide majority of 223 for the Conservative party, primarily at the expense of an unpopular Liberal Party. Baldwin campaigned on the &quot;impracticability&quot; of socialism, the Campbell Case, the Zinoviev letter (which Baldwin thought was genuine, and the Conservatives leaked to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; at a most damaging time to the Labour campaign; the letter is now widely believed to have been a forgery) and the Russian Treaties. In a speech during the campaign Baldwin said:

It makes my blood boil to read of the way which Mr. Zinoviev is speaking of the Prime Minister today. Though one time there went up a cry, &quot;Hands off Russia&quot;, I think it&#x27;s time somebody said to Russia, &quot;Hands off England&quot;.

==Prime Minister (1924–1929)==
===Cabinet===


Baldwin&#x27;s new Cabinet now included many former political associates of Lloyd George: former Coalition Conservatives: Austen Chamberlain (as foreign secretary), Lord Birkenhead (secretary for India) and Arthur Balfour (lord president after 1925), and the former Liberal Winston Churchill as chancellor of the exchequer. Baldwin created the Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies, a volunteer body of those opposed to the strike which was intended to complete essential work.

===Domestic affairs===
====Trade unions strike====
A defining feature of Baldwin&#x27;s Second term was the 1926 General Strike, Baldwin handled the strike by using powers awarded to him in the Emergency Powers Act 1920. He deployed the military and volunteers to keep essential services running. The strike ended when it was found to not be protected by the Trade Disputes Act 1906, leading to the strike being called off on 12 May lasting just 9 days. Baldwin&#x27;s government was widely credited for such an effective response to the strike.

At Baldwin&#x27;s instigation Lord Weir headed a committee to &quot;review the national problem of electrical energy&quot;. It published its report on 14 May 1925 and in it Weir recommended the setting up of a Central Electricity Board, a state monopoly half-financed by the Government and half by local undertakings. Baldwin accepted Weir&#x27;s recommendations and they became law by the end of 1926.

The Board was a success. By 1939 electrical output was up fourfold and generating costs had fallen. Consumers of electricity rose from three-quarters of a million in 1920 to nine million in 1938, with annual growth of 700,000 to 800,000 a year (the fastest rate of growth in the world).

====Social reforms====
One of his legislative reforms was a paradigm shift in his party. This was the Widows&#x27;, Orphans&#x27; and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act 1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5. c. 70), which provided a pension of 10 shillings a week for widows with extra for children, and 10 shillings a week for insured workers and their wives at 65. This transformed Toryism, away from its historic reliance on community (particularly religious) charities, and towards acceptance of a humanitarian welfare state which would guarantee a minimum living standard for those unable to work or who took out national insurance. In 1927, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society.

=====Leader of the Opposition (1929–1931)=====
In 1929 Labour returned to office as the largest party in the House of Commons (although without an overall majority) despite obtaining fewer votes than the Conservatives. In opposition, Baldwin was almost ousted as party leader by the press barons Lords Rothermere and Beaverbrook, whom he accused of enjoying &quot;power without responsibility, the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages&quot;.

Ramsden argues that Baldwin made dramatic permanent improvements to the organisation and effectiveness of the Conservative Party. He enlarged the headquarters with professionals, professionalised the party agents, raised ample funds, and was an innovative user of the new mass media of radio and film.

==Lord President of the Council (1931–1935)==
By 1931, as the economy headed towards crisis, both in Britain and around the world, with the onset of the Great Depression, Baldwin and the Conservatives entered into a coalition with Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. This decision led to MacDonald&#x27;s expulsion from his own party, and Baldwin, as Lord President of the Council, became &quot;de facto&quot; prime minister, deputising for the increasingly senile MacDonald, until he once again officially became prime minister in 1935.

One central and vitally important agreement was the Statute of Westminster 1931, which conferred full self-government upon the Dominions Canada, South Africa, Australia, the Irish Free State and New Zealand, while preparing the first steps towards the eventual Commonwealth of Nations, and away from the designation British Empire. In 1930, the first British Empire Games sports competition was held successfully among Empire nations in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

His government then secured with great difficulty the passage of the landmark Government of India Act 1935, in the teeth of opposition from Winston Churchill, spokesman for the die-hard imperialists who filled the Conservative ranks.

===Disarmament===
Baldwin did not advocate total disarmament, but believed that, as Lord Grey of Falloden had stated in 1925, &quot;great armaments lead inevitably to war&quot;. However, he came to believe that, as he put it on 10 November 1932: &quot;the time has now come to an end when Great Britain can proceed with unilateral disarmament&quot;. On 10 November 1932 he said:

I think it is well also for the man in the street to realise that there is no power on earth that can protect him from being bombed. Whatever people may tell him, the bomber will always get through, The only defence is in offence, which means that you have to kill more women and children more quickly than the enemy if you want to save yourselves...If the conscience of the young men should ever come to feel, with regard to this one instrument [bombing] that it is evil and should go, the thing will be done; but if they do not feel like that – well, as I say, the future is in their hands. But when the next war comes, and European civilisation is wiped out, as it will be, and by no force more than that force, then do not let them lay blame on the old men. Let them remember that they, principally, or they alone, are responsible for the terrors that have fallen upon the earth.

This speech was often used against Baldwin as allegedly demonstrating the futility of rearmament or disarmament, depending on the critic.

With the second part of the Disarmament Conference starting in January 1933, Baldwin attempted to see through his hope of air disarmament. However, he became alarmed at Britain&#x27;s lack of defence against air raids and German rearmament, saying it &quot;would be a terrible thing, in fact, the beginning of the end&quot;. In April 1933 the Cabinet agreed to follow through with the construction of the Singapore military base.

On 15 September 1933, the German delegate at the Disarmament Conference refused to return to the Conference, and Germany left altogether in October. Baldwin, in a speech on 6 October to the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, pleaded for a Disarmament Convention, and then said:

when I speak of a Disarmament Convention I do not mean disarmament on the part of this country and not on the part of any other. I mean the limitation of armaments as a real limitation...and if we find ourselves on some lower rating and that some other country has higher figures, that country has to come down and we have to go up until we meet.

Germany left the League of Nations on 14 October. The Cabinet decided on 23 October that Britain should still attempt to cooperate with other states, including Germany, in international disarmament. However between mid-September 1933 and the beginning of 1934 Baldwin&#x27;s mind changed from hoping for disarmament to favouring rearmament, including parity in aircraft. In late 1933 and early 1934 he rejected an invitation from Hitler to meet him, believing that visits to foreign capitals were the job of Foreign Secretaries. On 8 March 1934, Baldwin defended the creation of four new squadrons for the Royal Air Force against Labour criticisms, and said of international disarmament:

If all our efforts for an agreement fail, and if it is not possible to obtain this equality in such matters as I have indicated, then any Government of this country—a National Government more than any, and &quot;this&quot; Government—will see to it that in air strength and air power this country shall no longer be in a position inferior to any country within striking distance of our shores.

On 29 March 1934 Germany published its defence estimates, which showed a total increase of one-third and an increase of 250% in its air force.

A series of by-elections in late 1933 and early 1934 with massive swings against government candidates—most famous was Fulham East with a 26.5% swing— convinced Baldwin that the British public was profoundly pacifist. Baldwin also rejected the &quot;belligerent&quot; views of those like Churchill and Robert Vansittart because he believed that the Nazis were rational men who would appreciate the logic of mutual and equal deterrence. He also believed war to be &quot;the most fearful terror and prostitution of man&#x27;s knowledge that ever was known&quot;.

==Prime Minister (1935–1937)==
===National Government and appointment===

With MacDonald&#x27;s health in decline, he and Baldwin changed places in June 1935: Baldwin was now prime minister, MacDonald Lord President of the council. In October that year, Baldwin called a general election. Neville Chamberlain advised Baldwin to make rearmament the leading issue in the election campaign against Labour and said that if a rearmament programme was not announced until after the election, his government would be seen as having deceived the people. However, Baldwin did not make rearmament the central issue in the election. He said that he would support the League of Nations, modernise Britain&#x27;s defences and remedy deficiencies, but he also said: &quot;I give you my word that there will be no great armaments&quot;. The main issues in the election were housing, unemployment and the special areas of economic depression. The election gave 430 seats to National Government supporters (386 of these Conservative) and 154 seats to Labour.

===Rearmament===
Baldwin&#x27;s younger son A. Windham Baldwin, writing in 1955, argued that his father, Stanley, had planned a rearmament programme as early as 1934 but had to do so quietly to avoid antagonising the public, whose pacifism was revealed by the Peace Ballot of 1934–35 and endorsed by both the Labour and the Liberal oppositions. His thorough presentation of the case for rearmament in 1935, his son argued, defeated pacifism and secured a victory that allowed rearmament to move ahead.

On 31 July 1934, the Cabinet approved a report that called for expansion of the Royal Air Force to the 1923 standard by creating 40 new squadrons over the next five years. On 26 November 1934, six days after receiving the news that the German air force (Luftwaffe) would be as large as the RAF within one year, the Cabinet decided to speed up air rearmament from four years to two. On 28 November 1934, Churchill moved an amendment to the vote of thanks for the King&#x27;s Speech: &quot;the strength of our national defences, and especially our air defences, is no longer adequate&quot;. His motion was known eight days before it was moved, and a special Cabinet meeting decided how to deal with the motion, which dominated two other Cabinet meetings. Churchill said Nazi Germany was rearming and requested that the money spent on air armaments be doubled or tripled to deter an attack and that the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was nearing equality with the RAF. Baldwin responded by denying that the Luftwaffe was approaching equality and said it was &quot;not 50 per cent&quot; of the RAF. He added that by the end of 1935 the RAF would still have &quot;a margin of nearly 50 per cent&quot; in Europe. After Baldwin said that the government would ensure the RAF had parity with the future German air force, Churchill withdrew his amendment. In April 1935, the Air Secretary reported that although Britain&#x27;s strength in the air would be ahead of Germany&#x27;s for at least three years, air rearmament needed to be increased; so the Cabinet agreed to the creation of an extra 39 squadrons for home defence by 1937. However, on 8 May 1935, the Cabinet heard that it was estimated that the RAF was inferior to the Luftwaffe by 370 aircraft and that to reach parity, the RAF must have 3,800 aircraft by April 1937, an extra 1,400 above the existing air programme. It was learnt that Nazi Germany was easily able to outbuild that revised programme as well. On 21 May 1935, the Cabinet agreed to expanding the home defence force of the RAF to 1,512 aircraft (840 bombers and 420 fighters). (see also German rearmament)
On 22 May 1935 Baldwin confessed in the House of Commons, &quot;I was wrong in my estimate of the future. There I was completely wrong.&quot;

On 25 February 1936, the Cabinet approved a report calling for expansion of the Royal Navy and the re-equipment of the British Army (though not its expansion), along with the creation of &quot;shadow factories&quot; built by public money and managed by industrial companies. The factories came into operation in 1937. In February 1937, the Chiefs of Staff reported that by May 1937, the Luftwaffe would have 800 bombers, compared to the RAF&#x27;s 48.

In the debate in the Commons on 12 November 1936, Churchill attacked the government on rearmament as being &quot;decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all-powerful to be impotent. So we go on, preparing more months and years – precious, perhaps vital, to the greatness of Britain – for the locusts to eat&quot;. Baldwin replied:

I put before the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I and my friends were all very worried about what was happening in Europe. You will remember at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country than at any time since the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933... That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there... within the next year or two of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain... We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.

Churchill wrote to a friend: &quot;I have never heard such a squalid confession from a public man as Baldwin offered us yesterday&quot;. In 1935 Baldwin wrote to J. C. C. Davidson in a letter now lost that said of Churchill: &quot;If there is going to be a war – and no one can say that there is not – we must keep him fresh to be our war Prime Minister&quot;. Thomas Dugdale also claimed Baldwin said to him: &quot;If we do have a war, Winston must be Prime Minister. If he is in [the Cabinet] now we shan&#x27;t be able to engage in that war as a united nation&quot;. The General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Walter Citrine, recalled a conversation he had had with Baldwin on 5 April 1943: &quot;Baldwin thought his [Churchill&#x27;s] political recovery was marvellous. He, personally, had always thought that if war came Winston would be the right man for the job&quot;.

The Labour Party strongly opposed the rearmament programme. Clement Attlee said on 21 December 1933: &quot;For our part, we are unalterably opposed to anything in the nature of rearmament&quot;. On 8 March 1934, Attlee said, after Baldwin defended the Air Estimates, &quot;we on our side are out for total disarmament&quot;. On 30 July 1934, Labour moved a motion of censure against the government because of its planned expansion of the RAF. Attlee spoke for it: &quot;We deny the need for increased air arms...and we reject altogether the claim of parity&quot;. Stafford Cripps also said on that occasion that it was fallacy that Britain could achieve security through increasing air armaments. On 22 May 1935, the day after Hitler had made a Reichstag speech claiming that German rearmament offered no threat to peace, Attlee asserted that Hitler&#x27;s speech gave &quot;a chance to call a halt in the armaments race&quot;. Attlee also denounced the Defence White Paper of 1937: &quot;I do not believe the Government are going to get any safety through these armaments&quot;.

===Abdication of Edward VIII===
The accession of King Edward VIII, and the ensuing abdication crisis, brought Baldwin&#x27;s last major test in office. The new monarch was &quot;an ardent exponent of the cause of Anglo-German understanding&quot; and had &quot;strong views on his right to intervene in affairs of state,&quot; but the &quot;Government&#x27;s main fears... were of indiscretion.&quot; The King proposed to marry Wallis Simpson, an American woman who was twice divorced. The high-minded Baldwin felt that he could tolerate her as &quot;a respectable whore&quot; as long as she stayed behind the throne but not as &quot;Queen Wally&quot;.

Mrs. Simpson was also distrusted by the government for her known pro-German sympathies and was believed to be in &quot;close contact with German monarchist circles&quot;.

During October and November 1936, Baldwin joined the royal family in trying to dissuade the King from that marriage, arguing that the idea of having a twice-divorced woman as the Queen would be rejected by the government, by the country and by the Empire and that &quot;the voice of the people must be heard.&quot; As the public standing of the King would be gravely compromised, the Prime Minister gave him time to reconsider the notion of this marriage. According to the historian Philip Williamson, &quot;The offence lay in the implications of [the King&#x27;s] attachment to Mrs. Simpson for the broader public morality and the constitutional integrity which were now perceived—especially by Baldwin—as underpinning the nation&#x27;s unity and strength.&quot;

News of the affair was broken in the newspapers on 2 December. There was some support for the wishes of the King, especially in and around London. The romantic royalists Churchill, Mosley, and the press barons, Lord Beaverbrook of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and Lord Rothermere of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, all declared that the king had a right to marry whichever woman he wished. The crisis assumed a political dimension when Beaverbrook and Churchill tried to rally support for the marriage in Parliament. However, the King&#x27;s party could muster only 40 Members of Parliament in support, and the majority opinion sided with Baldwin and his Conservative government. The Labour leader, Clement Attlee, told Baldwin &quot;that while Labour people had no objection to an American becoming Queen, [he] was certain they would not approve of Mrs. Simpson for that position&quot;, especially in the provinces and in the Commonwealth countries. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Lang, held that the King, as the head of the Church of England, should not marry a divorcée. &quot;The Times&quot; argued that the monarchy&#x27;s prestige would be destroyed if &quot;private inclination were to come into open conflict with public duty and be allowed to prevail&quot;.

While some recent critics have complained that &quot;Baldwin refused the reasonable request for time to reflect, preferring to keep the pressure on the King – once again suggesting that his own agenda was to force the crisis to a head&quot; and that he &quot;never mentioned that the alternative [to the marriage] was abdication&quot;, the House of Commons immediately and overwhelmingly came out against the marriage. The Labour and Liberal parties, the Trades Union Congress, and the dominions of Australia and Canada, all joined the British cabinet in rejecting the King&#x27;s compromise, initially supported and perhaps conceived by Churchill, for a morganatic marriage that had originally been made on 16 November. The crisis threatened the unity of the British Empire, since the King&#x27;s personal relationship with the Dominions was their &quot;only remaining constitutional link&quot;.

Baldwin still hoped that the King would choose the throne over Mrs. Simpson. For the King to act against the wishes of the cabinet would have precipitated a constitutional crisis. Baldwin would have had to resign, and no other party leader would have served as the prime minister under the King, with the Labour Party having already indicated that it would not form a ministry to uphold impropriety. Baldwin told the Cabinet, one Labour MP had asked, &quot;Are we going to have a fascist monarchy?&quot; When the Cabinet refused the morganatic marriage, Edward decided to abdicate.

The King&#x27;s final plea, on 4 December, to broadcast an appeal to the nation was rejected by the Prime Minister as too divisive. Nevertheless, at his final audience with King Edward on 7 December, Baldwin offered to strive all night with the King&#x27;s conscience, but he found Edward to be determined to go. Baldwin announced the King&#x27;s abdication in the Commons on 10 December. Harold Nicolson, an MP who witnessed Baldwin&#x27;s speech, wrote in his diary:

There is no moment when he overstates emotion or indulges in oratory. There is intense silence broken only by the reporters in the gallery scuttling away to telephone the speech... When it was over... [we] file out broken in body and soul, conscious that we have heard the best speech that we shall ever hear in our lives. There was no question of applause. It was the silence of Gettysburg...No man has ever dominated the House as he dominated it tonight, and he knows it.

After the speech, the House adjourned and Nicolson bumped into Baldwin as he was leaving, who asked him what he thought of the speech. Nicolson said it was superb to which Baldwin replied: &quot;Yes ... it was a success. I know it. It was almost wholly unprepared. I had a success, my dear Nicolson, at the moment I most needed it. Now is the time to go&quot;.

The King abdicated on 11 December and was succeeded by his brother, George VI. Edward VIII was assigned the title of the Duke of Windsor by his brother and then married Mrs. Simpson in France in June 1937 after her divorce from Ernest Simpson had become final.

Baldwin had defused a political crisis by turning it into a constitutional question. His discreet resolution met with general approval and restored his popularity. He was praised on all sides for his tact and patience and was not in the least put out by the protestors&#x27; cries of &quot;God save the King—from Baldwin!&quot; &quot;Flog Baldwin! Flog him!! We—want—Edward.&quot;

John Charmley argued in his history of the Conservative Party that Baldwin was pushing for more democracy and less of an old aristocratic upper-class tone. Monarchy was to be a national foundation by which the head of the Church, the State, and the Empire would draw upon 1000 years of tradition and could unify the nation. George V was an ideal fit: &quot;an ordinary little man with the philistine tastes of most of his subjects, he could be presented as the archetypical English paterfamilias getting on with his duties without fuss.&quot; Charmley finds that George V and Baldwin, &quot;made a formidable conservative team, with their ordinary, honest, English decency proving the first (and most effective) bulwark against revolution&quot;. Edward VIII, flaunting his upper-class playboy style, suffered from an unstable neurotic character and needed a strong stabilising partner, a role that Mrs. Simpson was unable to provide. Baldwin&#x27;s final achievement was to smooth the way for Edward to abdicate in favour of his younger brother, who became George VI. Both father and son demonstrated the value of a democratic king during the severe physical and psychological hardships of the world wars, and the tradition was carried on by Elizabeth II.

==Retirement==

===Leaving office and peerage===
Following the coronation of George VI, Baldwin announced on 27 May 1937 that he would resign the premiership the next day. His last act as prime minister was to raise the salaries of MPs from £400 a year to £600 and to give the leader of the Opposition a salary. That was the first rise in MPs&#x27; wages since their introduction in 1911, and it particularly benefited Labour MPs. Harold Nicolson wrote in his diary that it &quot;was done with Baldwin&#x27;s usual consummate taste. No man has ever left in such a blaze of affection&quot;. Baldwin was appointed a Knight Companion of the Garter (KG) on 28 May and ennobled as Earl Baldwin of Bewdley and Viscount Corvedale, &quot;of Corvedale in the County of Salop&quot; on 8 June. In a BBC radio broadcast transmitted on 8 December 1938, Baldwin made a nationwide appeal for funds to help Jewish and other refugees fleeing persecution in Nazi Germany. For this, Baldwin was dubbed a &quot;guttersnipe&quot; by a Berlin newspaper. The &quot;Lord Baldwin Fund for Refugees&quot;, helping the kindertransport and other relief schemes, raised over £500,000 [£36,000,000 in 2022] 

===Attitude to appeasement===
Baldwin supported the Munich Agreement and said to Chamberlain on 26 September 1938: &quot;If you can secure peace, you may be cursed by a lot of hotheads but my word you will be blessed in Europe and by future generations&quot;. Baldwin made a rare speech in the House of Lords on 4 October and said that he could not have gone to Munich but praised Chamberlain&#x27;s courage. He also said the responsibility of a prime minister was not to commit a country to war until he was sure that it was ready to fight. If there was a 95% chance of war in the future, he would still choose peace. He also said he would put industry on a war footing the next day, as the opposition to such a move had disappeared. Churchill said in a speech: &quot;He says he would mobilise tomorrow. I think it would have been much better if Earl Baldwin had said that two and a half years ago when everyone demanded a Ministry of Supply&quot;.

Two weeks after Munich, Baldwin said prophetically in a conversation with Lord Hinchingbrooke: &quot;Can&#x27;t we turn Hitler East? Napoleon broke himself against the Russians. Hitler might do the same&quot;.

Baldwin&#x27;s years in retirement were quiet. After Chamberlain&#x27;s death in 1940, Baldwin&#x27;s perceived part in prewar appeasement made him an unpopular figure during and after World War II. With a succession of British military failures in 1940, Baldwin started to receive critical letters: &quot;insidious to begin with, then increasingly violent and abusive; then the newspapers; finally the polemicists who, with time and wit at their disposal, could debate at leisure how to wound the deepest&quot;. He did not have a secretary and so was not shielded from the often-unpleasant letters that were sent to him. After a bitterly critical letter was sent to him by a member of the public, Baldwin wrote: &quot;I can understand his bitterness. He wants a scapegoat and the men provided him with one&quot;. His biographers Middlemas and Barnes claim that &quot;the men&quot; almost certainly meant the authors of &quot;Guilty Men&quot;.

===Letter to Lord Halifax===
After Lord Halifax made a speech on the strength of prayer as the instrument that could be invoked by the humblest to use in their country&#x27;s service, Baldwin wrote to him on 23 July 1940:

With millions of others I had prayed hard at the time of Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God&#x27;s will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, &#x27;Thy will be done.&#x27; And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God&#x27;s plan, a plan on such a scale that it &quot;must&quot; be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. &#x27;You cannot see the plan&#x27;; then &#x27;Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?&#x27; And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.

===Iron gates criticism===
In September 1941, Baldwin&#x27;s old enemy, Lord Beaverbrook, asked all local authorities to survey their area&#x27;s iron and steel railings and gates that could be used for the war effort. Owners of such materials could appeal for an exemption on grounds of artistic or historic merit, which would be decided by a panel set up by local authorities. Baldwin applied for exemption for the iron gates of his country home on artistic grounds and his local council sent an architect to assess them. In December, the architect advised for them to be exempt, but in February 1942, the Ministry of Supply overruled that and said all his gates must go except the ones at the main entrance. A newspaper campaign hounded him for not donating the gates to war production. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; columnist &quot;Cassandra&quot; denounced Baldwin:

Here was the country in deadly peril with half the Empire swinging in the wind like a busted barn door hanging on one hinge. Here was Old England half smothered in a shroud crying for steel to cut her way out, and right in the heart of beautiful Worcestershire was a one-time Prime Minister, refusing to give up the gates of his estate to make guns for our defence – and his. Here was an old stupid politician who had tricked the nation into complacency about rearmament for fear of losing an election... Here is the very shrine of stupidity... This National Park of Failure...

There were fears that if the gates were not taken by the proper authorities, &quot;others without authority might&quot;. Thus, months before any other collections were made, Baldwin&#x27;s gates were removed except for those at the main entrance. Two of Beaverbrook&#x27;s friends after the war claimed that it was Beaverbrook&#x27;s decision despite Churchill saying, &quot;Lay off Baldwin&#x27;s gates&quot;. At Question Time in the House of Commons, Conservative MP Captain Alan Graham said: &quot;Is the honourable Member aware that it is very necessary to leave Lord Baldwin his gates in order to protect him from the just indignation of the mob?&quot;

===Comments on politics===
During the war, Churchill consulted him only once, in February 1943, on the advisability of his speaking out strongly against the continued neutrality of Éamon de Valera&#x27;s Ireland. Baldwin saw the draft of Churchill&#x27;s speech and advised against it, which Churchill followed. A few months after this visit to Churchill, Baldwin told Harold Nicolson, &quot;I went into Downing Street... a happy man. Of course it was partly because an old buffer like me enjoys feeling that he is still not quite out of things. But it was also pure patriotic joy that my country at such a time should have found such a leader. The furnace of the war has smeltered out all base metals from him&quot;. To D. H. Barber, Baldwin wrote of Churchill: &quot;You can take it from me he is a really big man, the War has brought out the best that was in him. His head isn&#x27;t turned the least little bit by the great position he occupies in the eyes of the world. I pray he is spared to see us through&quot;.

In private, Baldwin defended his conduct in the 1930s:

the critics have no historical sense. I have no Cabinet papers by me and do not want to trust my memory. But recall the Fulham election, the peace ballot, Singapore, sanctions, Malta. The English will only learn by example. When I first heard of Hitler, when Ribbentrop came to see me, I thought they were all crazy. I think I brought Ramsay and Simon to meet Ribbentrop. Remember that Ramsay&#x27;s health was breaking up in the last two years. He had lost his nerve in the House in the last year. I had to take all the important speeches. The moment he went, I prepared for a general election and got a bigger majority for rearmament. No power on earth could have got rearmament without a general election except by a big split. Simon was inefficient. I had to lead the House, keep the machine together with those Labour fellows.

In December 1944, strongly advised by friends, Baldwin decided to respond to criticisms of him through a biographer. He asked G. M. Young, who accepted, and asked Churchill to grant permission to Young to see Cabinet papers. Baldwin wrote:

I am the last person to complain of fair criticism, but when one book after another appears and I am compared, for example, to Laval, my gorge rises; but I am crippled and cannot go and examine the files of the Cabinet Office. Could G. M. Young go on my behalf?

==Last years and death==

In June 1945, Baldwin&#x27;s wife, Lucy, died. Baldwin himself now suffered from arthritis and needed a cane to walk. When he made his final public appearance in London in October 1947 at the unveiling of a statue of George V, a crowd of people recognised and cheered him, but he had become deaf and so asked: &quot;Are they booing me?&quot; Having been made Chancellor of the University of Cambridge in 1930, he continued in that capacity until his death in his sleep at Astley Hall, near Stourport-on-Severn, Worcestershire, on 14 December 1947. He was cremated in Birmingham, and his ashes were buried in Worcester Cathedral. No cause of death was revealed.

A memorial service was held at Wilden Church, near Stourport, Worcestershire.

Baldwin was a member of the Oddfellows and Foresters Friendly Society.

==Legacy==

Upon his retirement in 1937, he had received a great deal of praise, but the onset of World War II would change his public image for the worse. Baldwin, Chamberlain and MacDonald were held responsible for Great Britain&#x27;s military unpreparedness on the eve of war in 1939. Peter Howard, writing in the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; (3 September 1939), accused Baldwin of deceiving the country of the dangers that faced it in order not to rearm and so win the 1935 general election. During the ill-fated Battle of France in May 1940, Lloyd George in conversation with Churchill and General Ironside railed against Baldwin and said that &quot;he ought to be hanged&quot;.

In July 1940, a bestseller &quot;Guilty Men&quot; appeared, which blamed Baldwin for failing to rearm enough. In May 1941, Hamilton Fyfe wrote an article (&quot;Leadership and Democracy&quot;) for &quot;Nineteenth Century and After&quot;, which also laid those charges against Baldwin. In 1941, A. L. Rowse criticised Baldwin for lulling the people into a false sense of security and as a practitioner in &quot;the art of taking the people in&quot;:

what can this man think in the still watches of the night, when he contemplates the ordeal his country is going through as the result of the years, the locust years, in which he held power?

Churchill firmly believed that Baldwin&#x27;s conciliatory stance toward Hitler gave the impression that in the case of an attack by the German dictator, Britain would not fight. Churchill was known for his magnanimity toward political rivals such as Chamberlain but had none to spare for Baldwin. &quot;I wish Stanley Baldwin no ill,&quot; Churchill said in declining to send him 80th birthday greetings in 1947, &quot;but it would have been much better had he never lived.&quot; Churchill also believed that Baldwin, rather than Chamberlain, would be most blamed by subsequent generations for the policies that led to &quot;the most unnecessary war in history&quot;. An index entry in the first volume of Churchill&#x27;s &quot;History of the Second World War&quot; (&quot;The Gathering Storm&quot;) records Baldwin &quot;admitting to putting party before country&quot; for his alleged admission that he would not have won the 1935 election if he had pursued a more aggressive policy of rearmament. Churchill selectively quoted a speech in the Commons by Baldwin that gave the false impression that Baldwin was speaking of the general election, instead of the Fulham by-election in 1933, and omitted Baldwin&#x27;s actual comments about the 1935 election: &quot;We got from the country, a mandate for doing a thing [a substantial rearmament programme] that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible&quot;. In his speech on Baldwin&#x27;s death, Churchill paid him a double-edged yet respectful tribute: &quot;He was the most formidable politician I ever encountered in public life&quot;.

In 1948, Reginald Bassett published an essay disputing the claim that Baldwin &quot;confessed&quot; to putting party before country and claimed that Baldwin was referring to 1933 and 1934 when a general election on rearmament would have been lost.

In 1952, G. M. Young published an authorised biography of Baldwin that asserted that Baldwin united the nation and helped moderate the policies of the Labour Party. However, Young accepted the chief criticisms of Baldwin that he failed to rearm early enough and that he put party before country. Young contends that Baldwin should have retired in 1935. Churchill and Beaverbrook deemed several passages in the biography to be defamatory of their own actions and threatened to sue if they were not removed or altered. A settlement was reached to remove the offending sentences, and the publisher Rupert Hart-Davis had the &quot;hideously expensive&quot; job of removing and replacing seven leaves from 7,580 copies.

In response to Young&#x27;s biography, D. C. Somervell published &quot;Stanley Baldwin: An examination of some features of Mr. G. M. Young&#x27;s biography&quot; in 1953 with a foreword by Ernest Brown. This attempted to defend Baldwin against the charges made by Young. Both Young and Somervell were criticised by C. L. Mowat in 1955, who claimed that they both failed to rehabilitate Baldwin&#x27;s reputation.

In 1956, Baldwin&#x27;s son A. W. Baldwin published a biography entitled &quot;My Father: The True Story&quot;. It has been written that his son &quot;evidently could not decide whether he was answering the charge of inanition and deceit which grew out of the war, or the radical &#x27;dissenters&#x27; of the early 1930s who thought the Conservatives were warmongers and denounced them for rearming at all&quot;.

In an article written to commemorate the centenary of Baldwin&#x27;s birth, in &quot;The Spectator&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t Let&#x27;s Be Beastly to Baldwin&quot;, 14 July 1967), Rab Butler defended Baldwin&#x27;s moderate policies and claimed that it helped heal social divisions. In 1969 the first major biography of Baldwin appeared, of over 1,000 pages, written by Keith Middlemas and John Barnes, both Conservatives who wished to defend Baldwin.

In 1998, historian Andrew Thorpe wrote that apart from the questions of war and peace, Baldwin had a mixed reputation. He was moved by social deprivation but not to the point of legislation and systematically avoided intervention in the economy and social system. He had a ruthless style that included insincerity. His advisors were second rank figures like Davidson and Bridgeman. Thorpe wrote, &quot;Essentially, Baldwin was a much more neurotic and insecure character than his public persona would have suggested&quot;, as shown by his nervous breakdown in 1936 that kept him out of action for three months. On the other hand, Thorpe says that Baldwin was a good co-ordinator of his coalition who did not block colleagues who proposed various small reforms.

Thorpe argued that Baldwin&#x27;s handling of the 1926 general strike was &quot;firm and uncompromising&quot; but disliked the harsh Trade Disputes Act that followed because it was too far to the right of Baldwin&#x27;s preferred moderation. Thorpe praised Baldwin&#x27;s handling of the Abdication Crisis in 1936, which allowed Baldwin to leave office in a blaze of glory. Thorpe said that Baldwin often lacked drive and was too easily depressed, too pessimistic and too neglectful of foreign affairs. On the other hand, he achieved his primary goals of preserving capitalism, maintaining the parliamentary system and strengthening the Conservative Party as a leading opponent of socialism.

In 1999, Philip Williamson published a collection of essays on Baldwin that attempted to explain his beliefs and defended his policies as prime minister. Baldwin&#x27;s defenders argued that with pacifist appeasement the dominant political view in Britain, France and the United States, he felt he could not start a programme of rearmament without a national consensus on the matter. Williamson argued that Baldwin had helped create &quot;a moral basis for rearmament in the mid 1930s&quot; that contributed greatly to &quot;the national spirit of defiance after Munich&quot;.

Williamson admitted that there was a clear postwar consensus that repudiated and denigrated all interwar governments: Baldwin was targeted with the accusation that he had failed to rearm Britain in the 1930s, despite Hitler&#x27;s threat. Williamson said that the negative reputation was chiefly the product of partisan politics, the bandwagon of praise for Churchill, selective recollections, and the need for scapegoats to blame for Britain&#x27;s very close call in 1940. Only during the 1960s would political distance and then the opening of government records lead to more balanced historical assessments, but the myth had become so central to larger myths about the 1930s and 1940s that it persists as conventional wisdom about the period.

By 2004, Ball could report, &quot;The pendulum has swung almost completely towards a positive view.&quot; Ball noted, &quot;Baldwin is now seen as having done more than most and perhaps as much as was possible in the context, but the fact remains that it was not enough to deter the aggressors or ensure their defeat. Less equivocal was his rediscovery as a moderate and inclusive Conservative for the modern age, part of a &#x27;one nation tradition&#x27;.&quot;
